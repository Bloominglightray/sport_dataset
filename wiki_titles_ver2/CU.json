        "title": "Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2007",
        "text": "The Bangladesh cricket team toured Sri Lanka for three Test matches and three One Day Internationals in June and July 2007. This series held Mohammad Ashraful's first Test and ODI matches as captain of Bangladesh. Sri Lanka ended up winning all the Test matches and One-day Internationals.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nChaminda Vaas and Prasanna Jayawardene both recorded their first Test career centuries, both during the same partnership during the Sri Lankan innings. In addition, the partnership – worth 223 runs without dismissal (Sri Lanka declared their innings once Vaas reached his hundred) – set a seventh-wicket record for Sri Lanka.\n2nd Test.\nBangladesh's first innings of 62 all out is the lowest innings total for Bangladesh. Mohammad Ashraful and Mushfiqur Rahim 6th wicket partnership of 191 was a record partnership for Bangladesh.\n3rd Test.\nDay 1\nWith the 3 Test series already won Sri Lanka made 3 changes to their side. Chaminda Vaas was replaced by Sujeewa de Silva, while Upul Tharanga, recovered from a heel injury to take the place of Malinda Warnapura. Farveez Maharoof came in for Dilhara Fernando. Bangladesh made 2 changes to their side with Syed Rasel replacing Mohammad Sharif and Tushar Imran in for Mehrab Hossain Jnr.\nFor the third time in this Test series Mahela Jayawardene won the toss and chose to field. This meant that Javed Omar and Shahriar Nafees opened for Bangladesh. Lasith Malinga made an early breakthrough dismissing Omar lbw for 8 in the second over. This wicket would be the only wicket in the session as Habibul Bashar and Nafees batted until play was stopped due to rain and Bangladesh were on 44/1\nOn the fourth ball after the rain interval Habibul Bashar was caught behind. This resulted in Bangladesh making slow progress scoring only 5 runs in 5 overs before play was interrupted by rain again. Play resumed with the score at 53/2 and Bangladesh struggled to get runs and went through 3 maiden overs. Rajin Saleh was eventually removed, caught edging a doosra from Muralitharan to Mahela Jayawardene. Lack of scoring opportunities then saw Nafees take a rash shot which resulted in him being caught. This was the final wicket of the day and Bangladesh scored eight more runs in the day and the score was 72/4 at the end of day 1.\nDay 2\nA wet outfield threatened to delay the start of play but sunny conditions insured that the game started at the planned time of 10:30. Bangladesh began the day at 72/4 with Tushar Imran on 6 and Mohammed Ashraful on 4. Steady progress was made with 20 runs scored of 5.3 overs before Imran was caught mistiming a drive shot. A boundary by Ashraful in the 37th over saw Bangladesh pass the 100 mark and the over finished 102/5. Shortly afterwards however Ashraful was caught behind with the score on a nelson and Bangladesh were 111/6. Bangladesh scored 20 runs for the final 4 wickets as Mashrafe Mortaza and Mohammad Rafique were caught and bowled by Muralitharan while Shahadat Hossain and Syed Rasel both went for a duck. At the end of Bangladesh's first innings Shahriar Nafees was the leading scorer with 29 runs, while Muralitharan was the top wicket taker getting 6 wickets in the innings.\nThe rest of the day was hampered by rain and bad light with Sri Lanka only managing to bat for 8.4 overs scoring a quick 30 without loss before the end of the day 2.\nDay 3\nThe third day was dominated by Sri Lanka with scores of 165 and 222 by Mahela Jayawardene and Sangakkara respectively which included a 311 3rd wicket partnership.\nThe day started well for Bangladesh as they got the early wickets of Upul Tharanga and Michael Vandort. Upul Tharanga was bowled by Syed Rasel in the 14th over while Michael Vandort was trapped lbw and Sri Lanka were 74/2. Mahela Jayawardene and Sangakkara then put on 311 for the 3rd wicket before Jayawardene was dismissed on 165 caught by Mohammed Ashraful of Syed Rasel's bowling. Sangakkara was dropped by Mohammed Ashraful on 188 but he managed to run out Chamara Silva instead. On the 104th over Sangakkara made his second double century in the series hitting a full toss down square leg for 4. Quick batting by Tillakaratne Dilshan and Sangakkara meant that Sri Lanka finished the day on 500/4.\nDay 4\nSri Lanka made an overnight declaration which meant that Bangladesh required 369 runs to avoid another innings defeat.\nOmar and Nafees opened for Bangladesh once again and showed some resistance scoring 47 before Javed Omar edged a bouncer of Lasith Malinga and was caught in the 16th over by Sangakkara. Shahriar Nafees was the first Bangladeshi to get a half century in this Test reaching it in 70 balls. Soon after Habibul Bashar was bowled by Muralitharan and Bangladesh were 98/2. 6 more overs were played in the morning session before play was stopped due to rain and lunch was taken early with the score at 106/2.\nSoon after the restart Shahriar Nafees is deceived by a spinning delivery and is out caught. Ashraful soon followed as he was trappt lbw with the score on 138/4. The next 4 runs then cost Bangladesh 2 wickets as Mushfiqur Rahim was caught by Upul Tharanga at point while Rajin Saleh was caught behind going for a duck and Bangladesh were 142/6. Mashrafe Mortaza and Tushar Imran made 24 runs for the 7th wicket before Mortaza's attempted six didn't carry and was caught at long on by the sub. The final 3 wickets went for 8 runs, with the final wicket of Syed Rasel being Muralitharan's 700th wicket and Sri Lanka won by an innings and 193 runs.\nMuttiah Muralitharan was the man of the match with two five-wicket hauls of 6/28 and 6/54 in the Test, getting his 20th 10-wicket haul in the process and had match figures of 12/82. Muttiah Muralitharan was also voted man of the series."

        "title": "Richard Harris (American football)",
        "text": "Richard Drew Harris (January 21, 1948 – July 26, 2011) was an American professional football player who was a defensive end who played seven seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He was an All-American in 1970 for Grambling and was selected in the first round (5th overall pick) of the 1971 NFL draft by the Philadelphia Eagles, the first defensive player chosen. Harris was named to the NFL All-Rookie team in 1971 and was widely regarded as one of the fastest defensive linemen in professional football before being hobbled by knee injuries.\nHarris spent seven seasons as a lineman in the NFL — three with the Philadelphia Eagles, two more with the Chicago Bears, and a final two years with the Seattle Seahawks. After his retirement from the NFL, Harris began a second career as a coach, leading several indoor football teams as head coach before working as a defensive assistant for the BC Lions, Ottawa Renegades, and Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League (CFL).\nPersonal.\nRichard Harris was born January 21, 1948, in Shreveport, Louisiana. He was raised in the historically segregated Moretown section of the city by his mother, Annice Harris. He was diagnosed with a fatty buildup around his heart when he was about 12 years old and advised at the time to avoid strenuous physical activity — advice which was roundly ignored.\nRichard was only allowed to play two years of high school football. He explained:\n\"My mother didn't like the game. She used to think I would get crunched by those big guys, and since I was the oldest boy, she didn't want anything happening to me.\"\nTelling his mother that he was out playing with friends when he was really going to football practice, Harris learned the game and began to develop his natural athletic skills, making use of his sprinter-caliber speed. His mother eventually relented to her son's desire to play football, declaring, \"If you want it that bad, go ahead.\"\nInitially used as a running back, Harris soon switched to defensive tackle, expressing a desire to hit opponents rather than be hit. Initially very thin at 178 pounds, Harris nevertheless made use of his superior speed and quickness in the high school game, earning the attention of college recruiters.\nCollege career.\nInitially just 214 pounds when he reported to college, Harris played for head coach Eddie Robinson and his Grambling Tigers, filling out to become a 6'3\", 265-pound defensive lineman. Robinson enthusiastically remembered:\n\"He impressed us with his size and speed and quickness the first time we saw him. He could outrun most of our backs. Sometimes he'd get so worked up it was 'damn the torpedoes and full speed ahead' with him. We found out he has a temper. He is mean as hell.\"\nHarris was the star of a deep and talented 20-member senior class in 1970 which included several NFL prospects, including lineman Charles Roundtree and guard Solomon Freelon.\nA preseason All-American candidate in 1970, Harris was hobbled in October of his senior season by an ankle injury which sidelined him for two games. Despite the slow start, by December Harris had begun to assert himself as a prescient and powerful defensive stopper. The Grambling defensive captain was one of three Grambling players named to \"The Sporting News\"' 1970 All-America team, joined on this elite roster by defensive end Scott Lewis and wide receiver Frank Lewis. Harris was also named to the 1970 AP Little All-American team and was tapped for the Senior Bowl. He also played in the Blue-Gray Game and the Coaches' All-American Game.\nProfessional career.\n1971 NFL draft.\nGoing into the January 1971 NFL draft, Harris was highly touted by his former Grambling coach, Eddie Robinson, who deemed him \"the quickest big man in the country.\" The 265-pounder was timed at 4.7 seconds in the 40 yard dash, elite speed for his position.\nHarris was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the first round of the 1971 draft. He was taken in the first round, the fifth overall selection and the first defensive player selected.\nEagles owner Leonard Tose was enthusiastic about his team's choice, noting that it had Harris at number 4 on its draft board, behind only the first three selections of the lottery — quarterbacks Jim Plunkett, Archie Manning, and Dan Pastorini.\nTose told the \"Philadelphia Daily News:\"\n\"I like him because he'll improve the defensive rush. You do that and the whole team looks better. Here's a guy who can make the whole team look better. That's why we took him.\"\nHarris was selected ahead of future defensive members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame Jack Youngblood and Jack Ham.\nHarris was also named to the College All-Star team which played an exhibition game against the World Champion Baltimore Colts in July 1971, registering two sacks of quarterback Earl Morrall and chasing down running back Tom Matte from the back side on several sweeps, en route to earning Most Valuable Player honors. Colts veteran offensive lineman Bob Vogel was duly impressed, declaring, \"I think Harris is a load — he really had me scrambling. If he doesn't make it, nobody will.\"\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nHarris signed a contract with the Philadelphia Eagles on February 17, 1971. While official terms were not made public, the four year deal between Harris and the team was reportedly in the range of $130,000 to $160,000.\nNegotiations were clouded by legal wrangling between two sports agencies, one of which had been controversially dismissed in favor of representation by Dallas financier Zip Viracola. A lawsuit was threatened by the jilted New York agency.\nAfter a slow start during his 1971 rookie campaign, during which Harris rode the bench while the Eagles' defense gave up more than 30 points three weeks in a row, head coach Jerry Williams was replaced by Ed Khayat. Harris was inserted into the starting lineup and quickly began to come into his own, helping to anchor a defense which only gave up just 117 points over the next seven games. Harris was rewarded in December for his stellar rookie performance with a place as one of two defensive ends on the UPI All-Rookie Team.\nAs was common for many players during the era, Harris took a temporary job for the NFL off-season, joining the faculty at East Stroudsburg State College in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, where he taught physical education for a semester and helped out as an assistant coach during spring football practice. He would later seamlessly move into a career in coaching following the end of his NFL playing days.\nHarris' stellar rookie season was not repeated in 1972, however. Nursing a sore knee during the preseason, Harris was abruptly benched by defensive coach Jess Richardson in September, ostensibly due to a failure to maintain containment assignments. \"It was a matter of repeated errors or repeated following his assignment through,\" explained Richardson. \"It was more a matter of physical error than mental — he had problems physically with his opponent.\"\nAfter beginning the season 0-2, Harris was returned to his accustomed starting role as defensive left end in the third game of the 1972 season, a high profile Monday Night against the New York Giants in which brash owner Len Tose declared, \"I guarantee a victory.\" The guarantee of victory over their hated rivals was not backed up by the Eagles' play, however, as the team fell by a score of 27-12, with Harris hyperextending and injuring his right knee in first half action. Harris managed to return to the game and continue with his sophomore season, but the losses continued to mount and frustration built, with his best friend on the Eagles, guard Henry Allison, cut at the end of October by coach Khayat in an effort to spark the team's intensity.\nThe Eagles would finish the 1972 season ensconced in the cellar of the NFC East with a record of 2-11-1.\nAhead of the 1973 campaign, the Eagles attempted to rebuild their fortunes by trading star wideout Harold Jackson and two future first round draft picks for 32-year old quarterback Roman Gabriel. In making the trade, new Eagles' head coach Mike McCormack and the Philadelphia front office managed to protect Richard Harris, whom the Rams coveted and who was rumored to be involved in the portentous Gabriel trade.\nHarris was ultimately lost for the opening month of the 1973 season when he was double-teamed high and low in the fourth quarter of a September exhibition game against the New York Jets, partially tearing ligaments in his right knee. The team attempted to rehabilitate the injury without surgery. Moved to left tackle from his customary position of left end, the hobbled Harris, a former outside speed rusher, went into December with no sacks and was increasingly regarded as a draft bust, having failed to realize his enormous potential. His time with the Eagles neared its close, with the team insisting that he reduce his weight below 260 pounds before being moved back to his natural position of defensive end.\nAs the 1974 season approached, a strike was launched by the National Football League Players' Association, union of the NFL's players. The stoppage lasted from July 1 to August 10, canceling the College All-Star Game and forcing the teams to field rookie teams for most of the preseason. One of these rookies shined particularly brightly for the Eagles, defensive lineman Willie Cullars, a seventh round draft pick out of Kansas State. The termination of the strike spelled the end of Harris' time in Philadelphia, however, as on August 17 he was traded to the Chicago Bears for veteran cornerback Charlie Ford.\nEagles' line coach Jerry Wampfler indicated that the experiment of moving Harris from defensive end to defensive tackle had been a failure, declaring, \"He would go into one-on-one drills and look awesome. When he gets into a game, he doesn't use a move — he just plows.\"\nChicago Bears.\nHarris took umbrage to his sudden trade to Chicago, declaring that he felt as though he had \"left a piece of me in Philadelphia.\" He had particularly harsh words for Eagles line coach Jerry Wampfler, with whom he had a heated argument the day before the trade was announced. In response to public comments that he just plowed ahead in game action, Harris told a Philadelphia reporter: \"...If they think that's the way things are going, I hope those coaches can watch me tonight [in action against the Baltimore Colts]. They talk about being fair. That's a lot of [shit].\"\nThe Bears returned Harris to his natural defensive end position, but the year was a bad one for Harris as his new unit fell to the bottom of the NFC Central Division, ending the season with a record of 4-10. The losing began to take a toll as the team unraveled from within. After his first season in Chicago, Harris told the media:\n\"Losing is like you've had a hard day at the office; when you get home you're peeved and anything the family says could get you ticked off. People say the Bears are fighting [among themselves]. It isn't that we don't like each other — losing is like a time bomb inside of you waiting to go off.\"\nThe Bears substantially rebuilt for the 1975 season, returning 21 new players and adding 22 newcomers to the team. New Bears head coach Jack Pardee was very satisfied with Harris' performance going into the year, noting that his 21 tackles and 11 assists lead all linemen in the preseason. Harris opened the season in a game against his old Eagles club starting at defensive right end. By the end of October he was again battling knee problems, however, playing through pain. The Bears opened the season with a 1-4 record and hope of a playoff berth was doomed from the start.\nHarris opened the 1976 season, his sixth in the league, in the Bears' camp. He was placed on waivers by the Bears early in September, however, ending his tenure with his second NFL team.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nHarris was not without a job in the NFL for long. The same day hew placed on waivers by the Bears, Harris was claimed by the expansion Seattle Seahawks, who sought to solidify their young defensive line with an experienced veteran. Beginning the season as a reserve, Harris was added to the starting lineup at right defensive tackle by Seahawks coach Jack Patera in the middle of October.\nUnsurprisingly, the new Seahawks squad found themselves mired in the cellar of the National Football Conference's western division, finishing the season with a record of 2-12.\nCoaching career.\nCanadian Football League.\nIn 2001 Harris joined the staff of the Canadian Football League's BC Lions as a defensive assistant. He moved to the staff of the fledgling Ottawa Renegades in 2005, coaching there for a single season.\nHarris joined the staff of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in 2006, remaining with that team until his death.\nDeath and legacy.\nOn July 26, 2011, Harris suffered a fatal heart attack in his office at Canad Inns Stadium. He was 63 years old at the time of his death.\nDespite their coach's death, the Blue Bombers continued with their scheduled home game against the Lions two days later, winning 25-20. Prior to the game, both teams and the fans participated in an emotional tribute to Harris.\nHarris was survived by a wife and four children — three daughters and a son (Comedian Tony Baker is his son as well) — as well as three grandchildren."

        "title": "1923 Stanley Cup Finals",
        "text": "The 1923 Stanley Cup Finals was contested by the NHL champion Ottawa Senators and the WCHL champion Edmonton Eskimos. The previous WCHL-PCHA playoff format was abandoned, and the Ottawa Senators now had to play first the PCHA champion Vancouver Maroons, followed by the WCHL champion Edmonton Eskimos in the Finals.\nThis was the last Finals series until the 1983 Stanley Cup Finals to be contested by a team from Edmonton. Both games were played in Vancouver, making this the last Finals until 2020 played entirely at a neutral site (the 1924 and 1925 Finals each featured one neutral site game).\nPaths to the Finals.\nIn the NHL playoff, the Senators defeated the Montreal Canadiens in a 2-game total-goal series by a close 3–2 score in the series. Billy Coutu\ncharged Cy Denneny and Sprague Cleghorn butt-ended Lionel Hitchman in the first game and the Canadiens manager Leo Dandurand suspended both players for their actions. Odie Cleghorn and Didier Pitre did well in\nthe two players place, but Ottawa won the series.\nOttawa brought Montreal Canadiens right wing Billy Boucher west with\nthem in hopes that they could use him, but Frank Patrick ruled\nthat the undermanned Senators could not use him.\nThe playoff format of the previous year where the PCHA champion met the WCHL champion prior to playing the NHL champion was abandoned. Therefore, for this year, the PCHA champions were given the chance to play the NHL champion in a best-of-three series. The injury-riddled Senators then defeated Vancouver three games to one in the semi-finals.\nGame summaries.\nIn the first game, Edmonton was leading 1–0, on a goal by Crutchy Morrison, before the ailing Lionel Hitchman scored in the third period to tie the game. Duke Keats of Edmonton was awarded a penalty shot during the game, but failed to score. Cy Denneny, despite suffering from\na concussion, scored after two minutes of overtime to win the game for the Senators.\nIn the second game, the Senators got a first-period goal from Harry Broadbent and made it stand to the end of the game, playing six-man defence. The shots were recorded; 21, 14 and 13 for a total of 48 by the Senators, and 25, 18, and 25 for a total of 68 by Edmonton. Several players could not play the whole game, including Eddie Gerard and Georges Boucher. Lionel Hitchman played the game with his broken nose in a plaster. Harry Helman played despite a cut to his face from Frank Nighbor's skates, incurred in practice. Cy Denneny had been cut in the leg by the skate of Vancouver's Smokey Harris. 'Super-sub' King Clancy took a turn in all positions, including goal for Clint Benedict in the third period for two minutes when Benedict was serving a penalty. At the time goalies had to serve their own penalties. This is only time that a player played all six positions in a Stanley Cup Finals game.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1923 Stanley Cup was presented by the trophy's trustee William Foran. The Senators never did engrave their name on the Cup for their championship season.\nIt was not until the trophy was redesigned in 1948 that the words \"1923 Ottawa Senators\" was put onto its then-new collar.\nThe following Senators players and staff were members of the Stanley Cup winning team.\n1922–23 Ottawa Senators"

It was Montreal's fourth appearance in the Finals and second championship.\nThis was the last Finals until the 1983 Stanley Cup Finals to be contested by a team from Alberta and the last Finals until 1986 to be contested by a team from Calgary.\nPaths to the Finals.\nAs in 1922, the PCHA champion met the WCHL champion in a playoff, with the winner to meet the NHL champion in the Final. That series was held in Vancouver, Calgary and Winnipeg. The NHL champion would have to play the loser to advance to the Finals. Montreal first played the Vancouver Maroons, defeating them 2–0 in a best-of-three to advance to the Finals.\nGame summaries.\nThe first game was played in Montreal's Mount Royal Arena on slushy natural ice caused by warmer than usual weather. The second game was moved to Ottawa, to take advantage of the artificial ice.\nRookie forward Howie Morenz scored a hat trick in game one and a further goal in game two to lead the Canadiens. Morenz also was leveled by Calgary defenceman Herb Gardiner in game two and suffered torn shoulder ligaments and a chipped collarbone. Red Dutton played a robust game for Calgary in a losing cause and Joliat\nand Billy Boucher were hard pressed to get scoring chances. Georges Vezina was brilliant in getting his 3-0 shutout victory that brought the Stanley Cup to Montreal for the first time in eight years. \nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1924 Stanley Cup was presented by the trophy's trustee William Foran to the Canadiens at a banquet at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal on April 1, 1924.\nThe following Canadiens players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1923–24 Montreal Canadiens"

He was an infielder for two different Major League Baseball teams, the Washington Senators and the 1896 – Louisville Colonels.\nCareer.\nJim began his major league career with the 1896 Washington Senators of the National League, and split time between second base and third, hitting .279, driving in 30 runs, in 38 games played. On July 3 of that year, the Senators traded him, along with Jack Crooks and $1000 to the Louisville Colonels, also of the National League, for John O'Brien.\nHe hit .259 for Louisville that season, splitting his playing time at first base and second base. The following season, his last in the Majors, he began the season as player-manager, but was released on June 16, after 44 games and a 17–24 record. He signed the following day with the Pittsburgh Pirates, but did not play.\nPost-career.\nRogers died at the age of 27 in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and is interred at St. Michael's Cemetery in nearby Stratford. The cause of death was never released to the public. It was reported in the Jan 6, 1900, issue of The Sporting Life that Rogers death was caused by a brain injury sustained from being hit by a pitched ball earlier in his career."

The race was won by Portugal's Rosa Mota in 2:25:17, a new championship record, ahead of Zoya Ivanova of the Soviet Union in second and France's Jocelyne Villeton in third.\nIn warm conditions, the pre-race favourite, Mota, led from the start. Another of the runners expected to do well, Australia's Lisa Martin, was suffering from fatigue after working too hard in training, and she pulled out of the race after . Mota won the race by almost seven and a half minutes, but did not initially realise that she had finished the race, as she thought she still had to run another lap of the track in the stadium.\nBackground.\nThe race started and finished at the Stadio Olimpico, and largely stayed within the area of central Rome enclosed by the Aurelian Walls. It skirted around the lower edges of three of the seven hills of Rome without climbing any of them, and passed several ancient landmarks, including the Colosseum, the Baths of Caracalla and St. Peter's Square. Part of the course ran along cobbled streets, which along with the warm temperatures forecast, led to expectations that there would not be fast times in the race.\nSeveral of the world's quickest female marathoners were absent from the race. Ingrid Kristiansen, who was the world record holder, having run the 1985 London Marathon in 2:21:06, opted to run the 10,000 metres instead. Joan Benoit, the Olympic champion, was also missing, as she was pregnant. Grete Waitz, the reigning world champion suffered a suspected stress fracture in her foot after running a 5,000-metre time-trial on 15 August, and although she travelled to Rome and considered running with painkillers, she decided not to take the risk, and withdrew. In their absence, the favourites were Rosa Mota of Portugal and Australia's Lisa Martin. Mota was a two-time European champion, and the third quickest female marathoner, while Martin had run the fifth fastest women's marathon time. Both came into the Championships in less than ideal situations: Mota had been suffering from a urinary tract infection, while training in Florida, Martin had overtrained in hot conditions.\nSummary.\nThe race started at 16:55 local time on 29 August 1987, the opening day of the Championships, in temperatures of around . Mota took the lead before the marathon left the stadium, and extended it as the race progressed. She completed the first half of the marathon in 1:12:10, and won by over seven minutes. When she crossed the finish line, in 2:25:17, she continued running, as she thought she had another lap to complete. It was only when a race official flagged her down into her second lap, telling her that she had finished, that she stopped. She blamed her mistake on the instructions she had received before the race: \"an official told me I had to take two loops of the track\". Mota's time was a new championship record, beating the 2:28:09 set by Grete Waitz at the 1983 marathon.\nMartin, who was expected to be the most likely to challenge Mota in the race withdrew after ; she was falling back down the field, and her whole body felt sore. She blamed it residual fatigue from the problems she had suffered during training in Florida. Martin was one of nine runners to pull out of the race. Zoya Ivanova of the Soviet Union finished in second, in 2:32:38, while France's Jocelyne Villeton claimed bronze, in 2:32:53.\nAftermath.\nAt the 1988 Olympics, Mota beat Martin by 13 seconds and became the only woman to be the reigning European, World, and Olympic champion simultaneously."

        "title": "1983 World Championships in Athletics – Women's marathon",
        "text": "The women's marathon was one of the road events at the 1983 World Championships in Athletics in Helsinki, Finland. It took place on 7 August 1983, starting and finishing at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium. The race was won by Norway's Grete Waitz in 2:28:09, ahead of Marianne Dickerson of the United States in second and the Soviet Union's Raisa Smekhnova in third.\nIn warm conditions, Rumiko Kaneko of Japan and Ireland's Carey May led in the early stages, before Jacqueline Gareau of Canada took over, trailed by a pack of runners which included two of the favourites, Waitz and Julie Brown. Ireland's Regina Joyce took the lead by the point and opened a gap of around 30 seconds ahead of the chasing group. After , she was caught by a group led by Waitz, who was increasing the pace of the race. Gradually those running with her dropped back, leaving her to win the race by three minutes. Smekhnova was just ahead of Dickerson when they entered the stadium, but was passed by the American in a sprint finish.\nBackground.\nThe women's marathon was not an established event at an international level. It had not featured in the Olympic Games and had only become popular during the 1970s. Historically, some experts claimed that running the marathon distance, , was dangerous for women's health. As it gained prominence through the 1970s, there were calls for it to be added to the Olympics, though there was significant opposition. The governing body for athletics, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF, now World Athletics) announced that it would be added to the programme for the inaugural World Championships in Athletics in 1983, making it the first global championships to feature a women's marathon.\nIn 1983, an American runner, Joan Benoit, established a new fastest time for the women's marathon, when she ran 2:22:43 at the 1983 Boston Marathon; cutting almost three minutes off the previous fastest time, held jointly by Allison Roe of New Zealand and Norway's Grete Waitz. Of the three, only Waitz was taking part in the World Championships: Benoit did not run in the Avon International Marathon in Los Angeles, which the United States used as a qualifying race, choosing to focus on shorter distances instead. In Benoit's absence, \"The Observer\" and \"The Times\" described Waitz as the favourite for the race. The American press rated Julie Brown as their best chance of victory in the race; writing in the \"Hartford Courant\", Amby Burfoot said that despite the fact Waitz had beaten Brown in their previous meetings, Brown had \"recently brought a new maturity to her road racing\".\nThe race started at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium, and moved onto the streets of Helsinki, following an undulating course that Brown suggested would prevent fast times. The course passed Helsinki's docks, looped around the shore road, and past Market Square. After looping through downtown Helsinki, they returned to the stadium along the same route, to finish on the track.\nSummary.\nThe race started at 15:05 local time on 7 August 1983, the opening day of the Championships, in clear, dry conditions, with temperatures of around . Early on, Japan's Rumiko Kaneko and Ireland's Carey May led, passing the mark in 18:14. Canada's Jacqueline Gareau then established a small lead, passing the mark in 36:13, around ahead of a pack which included: Waitz of Norway; all three United States runners, Marianne Dickerson, Debbie Eide and Brown; Rosa Mota of Portugal; Italy's Laura Fogli and May from Ireland. later, Gareau still led, and the pack behind her had grown to include 13 runners. David Miller, a journalist for \"The Times\", criticised her inexperience in pressing ahead too early, but Gareau said it was the only way she could secure a good finishing position. Her lead, which peaked at around 30 seconds, was eroded and she was passed by Ireland's Regina Joyce between into the race. Waitz asked Brown if she thought they should go with her, but Brown said no: \"She'll come back to us\".\nJoyce, who had also opened up a lead of 30 seconds at one stage, led the race until the mark, when a surge from Waitz broke up the chasing group, and she led a smaller pack of five runners at the front. Along with Waitz were two Soviet athletes, Lyutsia Belyayeva and Raisa Smekhnova, Dickerson and Joyce. Running into the wind, they formed a single-file procession behind Waitz. later, Waitz was clear at the front; Smekhnova had tried to stay with her for as long as possible, but Waitz continued to extend her lead. Brown was unable to match the leaders' pace from around the stage due to an Achilles injury and dropped out of the race completely three miles later. Behind, Joyce had dropped out of medal contention when she had to stop for a toilet break, leaving Dickerson to vie with Smekhnova for second place. The American athlete was around behind Smekhnova with of the race remaining, but was closing the gap. Waitz won the race in 2:28:09 and had time to complete a victory lap before Smekhnova narrowly led Dickerson as they entered the stadium. Dickerson had enough energy left for a sprint finish, and passed Smekhnova on the bend of the track, and finished second in 2:31:09, exactly three minutes behind Weitz, and four seconds ahead of Smekhnova, who claimed the bronze medal. Mota finished in fourth, while the early race leader, Gareau, placed fifth. Waitz, who was running her first female-only race, said that the makeup of the race changed her tactics significantly, as there were no men around her to share the pacing responsibilities: \"Here, the final time didn't really matter. The idea was to win the Championship.\""

Sri Lanka's clinical demolition of Canada for 36 runs created a new World Cup record for the lowest innings score, a dubious distinction that was, at the time, the lowest score in ODI history. Records tumbled when defending champions Australia took on minnows Namibia, with Glenn McGrath claiming the World Cup's best bowling figures (7/15), a performance that helped Australia defeat Namibia by 256 runs. Team-mate Adam Gilchrist created a new wicket-keeping dismissal record in the same match, with 6. Against Namibia, Indian players Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly recorded the second highest partnership in World Cup cricket (244 runs). India and Australia clashed in a one-sided battle in the final, with Australia creating multiple records (highest World Cup final score, highest score by a captain in a World Cup final – Ricky Ponting, most sixes by a batsman – Ponting) in a match; with Australia winning by 125 runs. Tendulkar's 673 runs, the second most runs scored in a single World Cup history to date (this was the highest number of runs scored by a batsman in a World Cup, until Virat Kohli scored 765 runs in the 2023 edition of the tournament), was the consolation for India as he won the 2003 Cricket World Cup Man of the Series award. The World Cup also saw fielding records in an innings (Mohammad Kaif) and tournament (Ponting). The World Cup broke the record for most sixes in the tournament (with 266), but this was easily surpassed in the 2007 edition (with 373).\nTeam totals.\nHighest team totals.\nThe highest score of the 2003 Cricket World Cup came in the finals when Australia scored 359 runs against India in 50 overs. This represents the highest score made in the finals of Cricket World Cup.\nLowest team totals.\nCanada were bowled out for the lowest ever total in World Cup history against Sri Lanka; which was also, at the time, the lowest ever total in ODI history.\nBowling.\nMost wickets in the tournament.\nVaas's haul of 23 wickets in the tournament was, at the time, the record in World Cup history. His record was equalled or bettered by three bowlers in the 2007 edition of the World Cup (Glenn McGrath, Muttiah Muralitharan and Shaun Tait).\nBatting.\nMost runs in the tournament.\nThe 2003 Cricket World Cup had four cricketers scoring over 400 runs in the tournament (two Indians and two Australians), a record that has been bettered when ten cricketers scored more than 400 runs in the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Sachin's 673 runs in the 2003 Cricket World Cup is the second highest number of runs scored in a single edition in World Cup history.\nHighest individual scores.\nTwenty one individual centuries were scored in the 2003 Cricket World Cup, the highest across all editions.\nHighest partnerships of the tournament.\nThere were 25 century partnerships in the tournament, in comparison to 28 century partnerships in the 1999 Cricket World Cup. The top ten partnerships have been listed below. The 244 run partnership between Ganguly and Tendulkar is currently the second highest partnership in World Cup history.\nTied matches.\nAfter the tied semifinal match in the 1999 Cricket World cup that eliminated them South Africa were held to another tie when they scored 229 in 45 overs, needing 230 to win by the Duckworth–Lewis method, against Sri Lanka. South Africa needed a win to progress to the \"Super-6\" stage, but were ultimately eliminated from the tournament."

The game is the final entry in the \"Greatest Nine\" series.\nGame mechanics.\nGame modes.\nThere are four modes of games available.\nPlaying Fields.\nAll thirty teams from the Major League are available for selection. Only four stadiums (Safeco Field, Wrigley Field, Fenway Park and Pacific Bell Park) are available within the game, and all teams have one of these as their home ground regardless of where they come from. A planned Sega-themed stadium was created but ultimately not included because it did not fit with the game's more serious tone.\nPlayer statistics.\nAll player statistics in Exhibition Mode, Playoffs and the All-Star Game are those of the 2001 season. However, in Season mode, their stats are completely dependent on the results of each game played, meaning that the player has control of them. The game keeps all player statistics, such as batting average, ERA, RBI, season strikeouts and more. The game also has a history of records for seasonal stats and single game stats which the player can break as well.\nJapanese Differences.\nThe teams in the Japanese version are the Swallows, Giants, Baystars, Carp, Dragons, Tigers, Bufaloes, Hawks, Lions, Bluewave, Marines, and Fighters. It features four stadiums: Tokyo Dome, Hanshin Koshien Stadium, Seibu Dome, and Green Stadium Kobe. Additionally, the menu art, layout, and some of the music and sound effects have been changed.\nReception.\n\"Baseball Advance\" was a runner-up for \"GameSpot\"s annual \"Best Sports Game on Game Boy Advance\" award, which went to \"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3\"."

The relay competition took the place of the team event that had been held at every world championship since 1989. This event had all of teams start at the same part of the track (located at the women's singles/ men's doubles start house), then run down to the finish and tap on a relay marker to exchange from one slider on a team to the next (men's doubles to women's singles to men's singles) with the fastest time winning.\nEvent preparations.\nIn an effort to prepare for the championships, the track underwent a major renovation in 2006, costing €4 million. Ticket sales at the finish area for all three days were sold out. Besides the competitors, the organizing team consisted of 250 volunteers, 60 security guards, 30 referees, 100 service staff members, 15 tellers, ten drivers, and 30 German Army soldiers and members of the mountain rescue service. Organizing Committee President Bernd Rossmann (spelled Roßmann in Germany) stated that \"We can expect 5,000 Visitors each day, but we hope we can reach 10,000 daily. Tickets remain available.\" 200 media passes were also given out for the event. Television coverage took place live on Eurosport 2, showing the women's singles event, the first run of the men's singles event, and both runs of the men's doubles event.\nParticipating nations.\n21 nations entered competitors into the championships, including 42 men's singles, 36 women's singles, and 24 men's doubles. 77 officials were also part of the competitor's list.\nCountries that were planning on competing who withdrew were Argentina, Croatia, Hungary, Sweden, and Venezuela.\nTime tables.\nThe current, non-competitive schedule was updated as of January 22, 2008.\nMen's singles.\nJanuary 26, 2008 at 11 AM CET (10:00 UTC)\nLoch becomes the youngest world champion ever.\nWomen's singles.\nJanuary 25, 2008 at 2 PM CET (13:00 UTC)\nA retirement ceremony was held prior to the start of the event for four-time women's singles world champion Sylke Otto, who won in 2000, 2001, 2003, and 2005, before retiring prior to last year's world championships in Igls, Austria. Hüfner defended her title despite setting start and track records in the first run only to have current European champion Geisenberger follow up with start and track records of her own on the second run. Kraushaar-Pielach won her tenth and final career medal at the world championships.\nMen's doubles.\nJanuary 27, 2008 at 10 AM CET (09:00 UTC)\nThis was Florschütz and Wustlich's third world championship in this event, having previously won in 2001 and 2005. This is the first championship medal for the German duo of Wendl and Arlt who set the start record during the second run. It was the seventh medal for the Schiegl brothers. Defending world champions Patric Leitner and Alexander Resch of Germany finished a disappointing 11th place while defending European champions Christian Oberstolz and Patrick Gruber of Italy finished 21st after the first run and did not even qualify for the second run of the event.\nMixed team relay.\nJanuary 27, 2008 at 1 PM CET (12:00 UTC)\nThe Germans won their ninth medal of these championships and the first ever mixed team relay event in the world championships.\nTelevision ratings.\nOn January 27, 2008, the German television station ZDF, the mixed team relay had 3.21 million viewers or a 17.6 percent rating while the men's doubles event held earlier that day averaged 2.09 million viewers or an 18.2 percent rating.

        "text": "Strathlene at Findochty, near Buckie, is one of the oldest golf courses in Scotland. It was established in 1877 and is home to Strathlene Buckie Golf Club. The ground was given to the town by Mr Bryson the factor of Seafield Estates at that time. The original 9 holes were created between Portessie and Strathlene House, where 2 of the holes were situated in the area which is now the Caravan Site. The original clubhouse was situated at the entrance to Portessie railway Station. In 1936 the course was extended to 18 holes with the purchase of ground on the headland between Strathlene and the village of Findochty, and was designed by Mr George Smith of Lossiemouth.\nStrathlene is an interesting cliff top Links type course. Every hole has its own characteristics, of undulating fairways, gullies and elevated greens, making the most of the natural contours of the land. Four of the original holes make up the finish to the round. Strathlene is a fine test of golf for all levels of golfer, with its views of the Moray Firth, the dolphins and the surrounding countryside. It plays to a par of 69 and is 5977 yards in length.\nThe clubhouse was relocated on the cliff top overlooking Strathlene, in 1936 and a new one was built in 1974. The club bought the ground from the local council in 1997, and have recently completed the development of a new Golf Training Facility. It consists of practice bunkers, a 3-hole, pitch and putt, putting greens and a 14 bay driving range. This is a community project run by the club for the youth in particular, but is open to all. Strathlene also has full bar and catering facilities."

        "text": "Lawrence William Gilbert (December 3, 1891 – February 17, 1965) was an American right fielder in Major League Baseball and a longtime manager in minor league baseball. A native of New Orleans, Louisiana, who broke into baseball as pitcher, Gilbert first became famous as a member of the 1914 \"Miracle\" Boston Braves. \nPlaying career.\nThe , Gilbert batted and threw left-handed. Gilbert's professional playing career extended for 16 years (1910 to 1925). But his Major League career lasted only two seasons—the Braves' breakthrough 1914 campaign and 1915. In 117 big-league games, he batted .230 with 76 hits, five homers, 29 runs batted in, ten doubles and seven stolen bases. \nIn , Gilbert was a member of the Braves team that went from the eight-team National League's basement to first place in two months, becoming the first team to win a pennant after being in last place on the Fourth of July. The team then went on to defeat Connie Mack's heavily favored Philadelphia Athletics in the 1914 World Series. In his lone appearance in the series, Gilbert drew an intentional walk off Bullet Joe Bush as a pinch hitter in Game 3, played at Fenway Park. The walk came in the 12th inning, when the Braves won the game on Bush's throwing error one batter after Gilbert.\nManaging career.\nGilbert became more famous as a minor league manager in the Southern Association, where he led teams for 25 seasons, including the New Orleans Pelicans from 1923 to 1931 and 1933–38 and the Nashville Vols from 1939 to 1948. He took 1932 off from his dugout duties to serve as president of the Pelicans, then was a part-owner of the Vols from 1939 through 1955. His managing career was bracketed by pennants. His New Orleans club posted 89 wins and a .610 winning percentage in 1923, and his final club, in Nashville, won 95 games but lost the 1948 playoff championship.\nGilbert won eight Southern Association championships during his quarter-century in the league, including six consecutive titles (1939–44) with the Vols. His clubs twice won 101 games (1926 with New Orleans and 1940 with Nashville). Gilbert's career record as a minor league skipper was 2,128 wins and 1,627 defeats (.567).\nDeath and family.\nHe died in New Orleans of undisclosed causes at age 73. He was the father of Charlie Gilbert, a National League outfielder from 1940 to 1943 and in 1946–47, and Tookie Gilbert, a minor league slugger with the Vols who had two trials with the New York Giants in the early 1950s."

        "title": "Dream Match Tennis",
        "text": "Dream Match Tennis is a 2006 tennis simulation game developed by Bimboosoft, a company based in Saitama, Japan. Unlike other games in its genre, \"Dream Match Tennis\" was aimed to produce a more realistic depiction of the sport, requiring more skill from the player in order to direct their shots accurately.\nDue to the small size of the Bimboosoft Company, they were not able to use the same level of graphical effects for the game as other companies such as Sega could with like \"Virtua Tennis 3\".\nThis page refers to the \"Pro\" version of the game: v. 2.37 is the latest demo version. During the year 2021 it was released by Bimboosoft as free full version (v. 3.00).\nPlaying the game.\nThere are 5 different kinds of shot in \"Dream Match Tennis\":\nNormal Shot (also hits a 'normal speed' serve, usually used as a second serve)\nHard Shot (also hits a 'hard' serve, usually used as a first serve)\nSlice Shot (also hits a 'slice' serve, usually used as a first serve)\nLob\nDrop Shot\nA Super-Hard Shot has also been recently added, which is harder than the hard shot, but with the added risk of the shot going long or into the net.\nThe normal shot has been criticized for some of the characters, as it is so weak for the likes of Mason that a hard shot must be used the entire time, negating the use of the normal shot.\nUnlike most tennis games, \"Dream Match Tennis\" is controlled primarily through the use of timing rather than simply the directional buttons. If a player wants to hit a cross-court shot, they have to hit the ball slightly early. If they want to hit the ball in the opposite direction, they have to hit it slightly later (i.e., when it's going behind the player's character). The directional buttons can be used to get extra angle or direction; for instance, the downwards directional button makes the ball go short, and is useful for hitting angled cross-court shots.\nServing is also performed via correct timing - each character has a unique serving motion, and the shot button must be pressed at the correct moment in order for the ball to go into the court. The moment that the shot button must be pressed varies depending on what kind of serve is being hit, and at what pace the serve is being hit at (pressing the upwards button makes the serve more powerful, whereas pressing the downwards button makes it travel more slowly). The serve is noticeably more effective in \"Dream Match Tennis\" than in other tennis games, and the characters with the more powerful serves are capable of hitting up to 14 aces per set (depending on the quality of the opponent).\nPlayers.\nThe number of playable characters has risen to 13 (only one female among them) since the release of the game, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. All of the characters are based on real players, with their names altered in order to avoid licensing issues:\nR. Ford (based on Roger Federer) – considered to be one of the best characters in the game, Ford has powerful groundshots with much spin, is capable of serving at up to 128 mph (his serve speed has been reduced from earlier versions), is quick around the court and is also good at volleying. Ford has been weakened in the last few versions of the game due to balancing issues.\nR. Nelson (based on Rafael Nadal) – along with Ford is thought of as one of the strongest characters, with a powerful forehand that can generate extreme angles, a strong backhand and good speed around the court. The strength of Nelson's serve is somewhat of an issue with some players of the game, as it is considered too effective when compared to Nadal's serve in reality.\nP. Scott (based on Pete Sampras) – slightly weaker than Ford and Nelson, Scott nevertheless has a very powerful serve (he is capable of serving up to 135 mph), a powerful forehand and solid backhand, with good volleys.\nA. Arnold (based on Andre Agassi) – a strong baseline player, Arnold is capable of hitting winners from either his forehand or backhand very easily, but this is offset by his poor volleys and relatively ineffective serve.\nS. Evans (based on Stefan Edberg) – rarely used in multiplayer matches, this player has an accurate serve, very good volleys and a powerful backhand, but his weak forehand and slowness around the court make it difficult to compete with the better characters when using him.\nB. Baron (based on Boris Becker) – has a powerful serve that is easy to time (around the same speed as Ford), but is fairly lumbering around the court with only average groundshots.\nA. Richmond (based on Andy Roddick) – the newest addition to the game, this character has a very powerful serve (he can hit it up to 150 mph), and a strong forehand, but his backhand and volleying ability are among the worst in the game. He is also very slow.\nI. Leach (based on Ivan Lendl) – a powerful baseline player, his forehand is one of the strongest in the game, but tough to control when using super hard shots and his backhand is also very strong. However, he is also slow and his serve, while being quite powerful, is hard to aim accurately.\nM. Cooper (based on Michael Chang) – extremely quick around the court, with an average forehand and a good backhand, and a serve that is difficult to time.\nJ. Mason (based on John McEnroe) – this character has very weak groundshots, and a serve that, while also lacking power, is capable of getting aces due to the amount of spin on it. He is also quick around the court, with good volleys. J. Mason is the only character available to use online in the free demo of the game, and is consequently used frequently in multiplayer matches. This has become an annoyance with some players who have purchased the game, because Mason is unable to maintain a rally with some of the more hard hitting players such as Ford or Nelson.\nS. Gibson (based on Steffi Graf) – the only female character in the game, she is virtually never used in an online match because each one of her shots is among the worst in the game.\nJ. Cain (based on Jimmy Connors) – Cain has a very weak serve (only capable of reaching just over 100 mph), but his groundshots are powerful and he is able to easily hit winners. However, the fact that they do not have much spin means they often go in the net when going for angled shots. His volleys are also among the worst in the game.\nB. Banks (based on Björn Borg) – a good baseline player, Banks is somewhat of a jack-of-all-trades, with average power on each of his shots and mediocre speed around the court.\nThe characters most often used in online games are Ford, Nelson, Richmond and Arnold.\nGame modes.\nExhibition – this is where a match (either singles or doubles) can be played between any two characters. This can either be a human against the computer, of which there are a number of different difficulties (with 'beginner' being the easiest, and 'insane' being the hardest), or a human against another human (either using a gamepad, or online). Doubles matches cannot be played online yet.\nChallenge – this is a single-player mode, where a player using any character has to beat 4 randomly chosen characters on each of the 4 Grand Slam surfaces. Unlike 'exhibition' mode, the computer difficulty only ranges from beginner to pro, with no insane level.\nWorld Tour – the player chooses a character and has to play in a number of events around the world against computer controlled opponents, trying to reach the ranking of world number 1.\nPractice – this is where a player can practice any kind of shot with any character."

The JBA is a member of FIBA and FIBA Asia.\nThe federation is responsible for the Japan national basketball team and the Japan women's national basketball team and their Under-age teams.\nIt also manages the B.League commenced in October 2016.\nAs of April 2021, its president has been Yuko Mitsuya.\nHistory.\nThe JBA was suspended by FIBA on 25 November 2014 for failure to restructure as a fully functional entity and merge two competing leagues (the National Basketball League and the bj league) that had different rules (FIBA and NBA respectively).\nYasuhiko Fukatsu had earlier resigned as JBA president on 23 October as talks of a merger between the two leagues fell through. \nThis sanction prevented the JBA from participating in activities (sporting or otherwise) of FIBA and FIBA Asia, which also meant that the national teams would not be able to take part in any FIBA competition.\nJapan 2024 Task Force (the task force implemented by FIBA in order to reform basketball management in the country) co-chairman Saburō Kawabuchi was chosen as JBA president on 13 May 2015, on recommendation from FIBA.\nIn May of that year, the Japanese national teams were again allowed to take part in FIBA competition, starting with the 2015 FIBA Asia Women's Championship and 2015 FIBA Asia Championship, with suspension expected to be lifted at FIBA's Central Board meeting taking place in Tokyo in August.\nThe suspension was lifted on 9 August 2015, with FIBA praising the work done over the space of six months to overhaul the structure of the JBA and implement a new combined league (the Japan Professional Basketball League) to start play in 2016.\nCurrent title holders.\nSource: JBA\nPartnership with Australia.\nSince 2018, there has been an ongoing partnership with the Basketball Australia.

        "title": "Women's international rugby union",
        "text": "Women's international rugby union has a history going back to the late 19th century, but it was not until 1982 that the first international fixture (or \"test match\") involving women's rugby union took place. The match was organised in connection with the Dutch Rugby Union's 50th anniversary: as part of the celebrations, on June 13, 1982, the French national women's team played the Dutch in Utrecht, Netherlands, with France winning 4–0 in a game that has since been recognised as the first ever women's international rugby union match.\nOfficial recognition of women's internationals was not immediate, as almost all women's rugby was originally organised outside of the control of either national unions or World Rugby (WR) for many years. Partly as a result, no internationally agreed list of rugby internationals exists; even in the men's game, WR does not decide which matches are \"full internationals\" (or \"test matches\"), leaving such decisions up to participating unions.\nAs a result, one country may classify a match as a full international (and award full test caps) while the opposition may not: countries may even award caps for games against an opposition that is not a national team (World XVs, for example).\nInternational rugby initially grew slowly. Sweden joined France and the Netherlands in 1984, followed by Italy in 1985. It was not until 1987 with a U.S. v. Canada matchup that the first international took place outside Europe, and not until 1990, with New Zealand hosting a match, that the first match was played by a Southern Hemisphere team or played in the Southern Hemisphere. However, since 2003 the game has expanded rapidly, and now over 50 nations have played at least one \"test match\".\nOver 1,000 internationals have now been played. Traditional centres of rugby in New Zealand, England, and France have been the most successful nations, but they have been joined by a number of \"non-traditional\" nations who have also been successful, such as the United States and Canada.\nRankings.\nUnlike men's rugby, there was historically no official ranking of women's teams — prior to 2016, WR generally referred to the placings in the preceding World Cup. However, Rugby Europe compiles an annual ranking of European teams and rugby statistician Serge Piquet has produced a currently unofficial, but generally accepted, world ranking list. Another list appears on The Roon Ba website.\nOn 1 February 2016, WR introduced its first official rankings of women's national teams, calculated in virtually the same manner as the existing rankings for men's national teams.\nInternational women's matches.\nDefinition of an \"international\":\nIndividual unions compile their own international records. As a result, the list below will conflict with some of these \"official\" records (much in the same way as they will conflict with each other) as unions:\nFor consistency this list has used the following criteria when defining what is or is not an international:\nWorld Rugby Rankings (women).\nThe World Rugby Rankings for women is a ranking system for women's national teams in rugby union, managed by World Rugby, the sport's governing body. The teams of World Rugby's member nations are ranked based on their game results, with the most successful teams being ranked highest. A point system is used, with points being awarded based on the results of World Rugby-recognized international matches. The women's rankings are calculated in the same manner as WR's existing men's rankings, with minor adjustments to reflect historic differences between women's and men's rugby.\nWomen's Test Ranking (unofficial).\nBefore early 2016, there was no official World Rugby ranking list for women's rugby. Several unofficial lists have been produced, with the list developed by Serge Piquet in 2009 having widest circulation following its adoption by women's rugby website ScrumQueens.com in 2013.\nThe system is similar in many ways to that used by WR for its men's rankings, and includes data from every women's international match since 1982.\nMatch points are awarded to each country as follows:\n1. Match level – generally the mean of combined points the two teams before the match, with a minima.\n2. The result – 400 points for a win, 200 for a draw, 100 for a defeat or 0 for a forfeit in an official competition.\n3. Match venue – 100 points is shared between the two teams. A team playing at home against an opponent from another continent gets 0 point, but 100 is awarded to their opponents. 25 points goes to the home team if the opponent is from the same continent, and 75 for their opponents. 50 goes to each team if they are playing on neutral ground.\n4. Number of scored points and the points difference.\n5. World Cup – a bonus of 50 points for games in qualifying rounds, 100 in pool phases of the finals, 150 for playoffs and 200 for the final.\nMatches against A, B, Emerging, Amateur, Junior, Student, Army, Police or Services teams (and provinces/clubs when these games are part of official competitions) are also taken into account.\nNomads, Caribbean Select XV and Great Britain awarded ranking points but not a ranking position.\nAfter each match a team's new ranking points total will be equal to the sum of 10% of their match points, and 90% of the ranking number before the match. This method evens out occasional surprise results and ensures that the ranking rewards consistency of performance.\nFinally, in order that current form is given priority over historic performances, points gained from past matches decrease by 2% per year.\nDifferences between men's and women's rankings.\nAlthough the ranking is similar in principle to that produced by WR for men's rugby since 2003 and women's rugby since 2016, there are some differences that take into account differences in women's rugby.\nThe WR system, for both men and women, does not account for the level of the teams — the winner gains some points, and the loser loses them, regardless of the relative levels of the opponents. This means that a lower-tier team will lose ranking points with a loss to a higher-tier team, even if the result is much closer than expected. Given the sometimes wide variation in strength of teams — even in the same competition — this is too simplistic for women's rugby.\nThe WR ranking also does not account for matches against \"special\" teams, especially those that are not WR members — but for many of the smaller women's nations, games against teams such as England \"A\" are more significant, tougher, and often as good a guide to their strength, if not better, than those against some full-strength test teams. As a result, such games are included in this ranking.\nFinally, a new team added to WR's rankings is arbitrarily awarded a fixed number of points (currently 30 in the men's game, and 40 in the women's game). before December 2012, a men's team had to play at least 10 matches to be classified. Given the number of tests women's teams play this would be a significant barrier to inclusion.\nAn alternative ranking is available at the site 22metri and is based on the WR calculation method applied to the games played from January 2010 with teams assigned an arbitrary starting points of 40, 30 and 20 based on tier. The ranking is similar to the one from Scrumqueens, as expected.\nHighest team scores.\n\"up to and including 24 November 2018\"\nSources of women's international results.\nThe above results have been traced mainly via the following listings of national and tournament results – most being national RFUs. Other results have been traced via numerous news reports.\nWomen's rugby participation rates.\nRatio of registered female rugby players to the total female population."

        "text": "Jim Williams (March 3, 1919 – May 31, 2007) was an American basketball coach and college athletics administrator. He served the head coach of the Colorado State University men's basketball program for 26 seasons, from 1954 to 1980. Williams succeeded Bill Strannigan following the program's first ever NCAA Tournament appearance. During his tenure he amassed 352 wins, the most for any Division I college coach in Colorado history.

        "text": "The European zone of qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup saw 53 teams competing for 13 places at the finals in South Africa. The qualification process started on 20 August 2008, nearly two months after the end of UEFA Euro 2008, and ended on 18 November 2009. The qualification process saw the first competitive matches of Montenegro.\nDenmark, England, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, and Switzerland qualified in the first round by winning their groups. France, Greece, Portugal, and Slovenia qualified via the second round play-offs.\nFormat.\nTeams were drawn into eight groups of six teams and one group of five teams. The nine group winners qualified directly, while the best eight second-placed teams contested home and away play off matches for the remaining four places. In determining the best eight second placed teams, the results against teams finishing last in the six team groups were not counted for consistency between the five and six team groups.\nSeeding.\nAfter initially proposing to use a similar system to recent World Cup and European Championship qualification (based on results across the previous two European qualification cycles), the UEFA Executive Committee decided on 27 September 2007 at its meeting in Istanbul that seeding for the qualifiers would be based on FIFA World Rankings, in accordance with the FIFA World Cup regulations (which note that where teams are ranked on \"performance\" criteria, the FIFA World Rankings must be used).\nThe November 2007 FIFA World Ranking the most recent at the time of the preliminary draw and used to determine the groups. Initially scheduled for 21 November, FIFA moved the release date of the ranking to 23 November to include the final match days of Euro 2008 qualification.\nDraw.\nThe draw for the group stage took place in Durban, South Africa on 25 November 2007. During the draw, teams were drawn from the six pots A to F (see above) into the nine groups below, starting with pot F, which filled position 6 in the groups, then continued with pot E filling position 5, pot D in position 4 and so on.\nSummary.\nTable – top row: group winners, second row: group runners-up, third row: others. The winner of each group qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup together with the winners of the play-off. The play-offs took place between the eight best runners-up among all nine groups while the worst group runner-up did not qualify.\nFirst round.\nRanking of second placed teams.\nBecause one group had one team fewer than the others, matches against the sixth placed team in each group were not included in this ranking. As a result, eight matches played by each team counted for the purposes of the second placed table.\nSecond round.\nThe UEFA second round (often referred to as the play off stage) was contested by the best eight runners up from the nine first round groups. The winners of each of four home and away ties joined the group winners in the World Cup finals in South Africa. Norway, with 10 points, was ranked 9th so failed to qualify for the second round.\nSeeding and draw.\nThe eight teams were seeded according to the FIFA World Rankings released on 16 October (shown in parentheses in the table below). The draw for the ties was held in Zürich on 19 October, with the top four teams seeded into one pot and the bottom four teams seeded into a second. A separate draw decided the host of the first leg.\n&lt;section end=Seeding /&gt;\nQualified teams.\nThe following 13 teams from UEFA qualified for the final tournament.\nTop goalscorers.\nBelow are full goalscorer lists for all groups and the play-off rounds:"

        "text": "Thomas James Griffin (born February 22, 1948) is a former professional baseball pitcher. He played all or part of 14 seasons in Major League Baseball (1969–1982), for the Houston Astros, San Diego Padres, California Angels, San Francisco Giants, and Pittsburgh Pirates.\nCareer.\nGriffin was selected in the 1st round (4th overall) in the 1966 January Regular Baseball Draft by the Houston Astros out of Grant High School, in Los Angeles, California.\nGriffin made his debut on April 10, 1969, against the San Diego Padres. He pitched seven innings while striking out eight and walking five and allowing two runs on three hits, but the Padres prevailed 2–0. In that season, he would go 11–10 with a 3.54 ERA in 31 games, pitching 188.1 innings while striking out 200 batters and walking 93, with the latter two being highs for Griffin. Two additional pitchers in Larry Dierker and Don Wilson joined him in having at least 200 strikeouts, the second team to ever have three 200+ strikeout pitchers. It took the final start of the year for Griffin to reach the 200 plateau, which he did with his sixth strikeout of the September 28th game against the Cincinnati Reds, doing so against Woody Woodward in the sixth in a 4–1 loss. He led the league in strikeouts per nine innings with 9.6.\nHe would regress significantly in the next few seasons. In 1970, he pitched in 23 games while having a 3–13 record with a 5.74 ERA in 111.1 innings, having 72 walks and strikeouts and 13 wild pitches (6th in the National League). The next year, he appeared in just 10 games, going 0–6 with a 4.78 ERA in 37.2 innings while having 20 walks and 29 strikeouts. He was shifted to appearing in the middle of games for 1972, appearing in 39 games while starting just five, and he went 5–4 with 3 saves on a 3.24 ERA in 94.1 innings while having 38 walks and 83 strikeouts.\n1974 indicated a last flickering of growth. He went 14–10 with a 3.54 ERA in 34 games (all starts) in 211 innings with a career-high eight complete games. He struck out 110 batters and walked 89 (both peaks that would never be that high in his remaining eight years). He was 8th in shutouts with three while 5th in wild pitches with 11 and 3rd in errors with 8th. On May 7, 1974, Griffin threw a one-hitter against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He allowed one hit while allowing a run to score on three errors in the field (including a balk), but the Astros won 2–1.\n1976 was a bumpy road for Griffin. In 20 games for the Astros (two starts), he went 5–3 with a 6.05 ERA in 41.2 innings, striking out 33 with 37 walks. Griffin was taken on waivers by the Padres on August 3, 1976. He went 4–3 with a 2.94 ERA in 11 games (all starts) in 70.1 innings, striking out 36 with 42 walks. The next season, he went 6–9 with a 4.46 ERA in 38 games (20 starts) in 151.1 innings, walking 88 batters with 79 strikeouts. He became a free agent after the 1977 season, signing with the California Angels on January 27. He went 3–4 with a 4.02 ERA in 24 games (4 starts) and 56 innings while striking out 35 and walking 31. He was released by the team after the end of the 1978 season.\nHe signed on with the San Francisco Giants on April 4, 1979. He went 5–6 that year, having a 3.91 ERA in 59 games (3 starts) as he garnered two saves in 94.1 innings, striking out 82 with 46 walks. The following year, he went 5–1 with a 2.76 ERA in 42 games (four starts) in 107.2 innings as he struck out 79 with 49 walks, although he led the league in hit batsmen with eight. In 1981, he went 8–8 with a 3.76 ERA in 22 games (all starts) in 129.1 innings while striking out 83 and walking 57 and leading the league in hit batsmen with seven. He was traded to Pittsburgh on December 11, 1981 for Doe Boyland. He would play in just six games for the Pirates, going 1–3 with a 8.87 ERA in 22.1 innings, walking 15 and striking out 8. Oddly enough, his last game of his career was against his old team in Houston on May 11. He pitched four innings while allowing three earned runs with one strikeout and six walks as the losing pitcher in a 4–2 Astros win. Four days later, he was released by the Pirates."

There are also deities of Goddess Durga (Parvati), Lord Hanuman, Krishna etc. The Sai Mandir was opened in 1981 and is a prayer hall dedicated to Bhagavan Sri Sathya Sai Baba.\nIt was the first fully consecrated Hindu temple in Europe (1981).\nDuring the temple's early years, the realisation came that there was an urgent need to educate the younger generation about Hinduism. Furthermore, the temple wanted the children to fully understand the faith at a deeper level than previously. Therefore, the Sai Mandir has been running classes for many years, teaching the children spiritual education, Sanskrit prayers, how to sing Bhajans (devotional hymns) in addition to learning about other religions too. Voluntary activities take place in affiliation with local authorities and Age Link groups.\nThe temple provides classes dwelling on teachings of Hinduism, music and dance classes, and yoga to name a few.\nCommunity.\nShelter for Refugees\nRefugees from Sri Lanka have been given temporary shelter at the Temple in 1986. The BBC recorded this info as part of their DomesDay Project in 1986.\nScouts - 23rd Wimbledon\nThis temple became Europe's first Hindu temple in the UK to be home to a Scout Group. The 23rd Wimbledon was established by Scout Leader, Geetha Maheshwaran in Autumn 2012 .\nSchool trips - Religious Education\nThe school is listed in Merton Council Directory as providing Hindu religious, social and cultural services for all ages, especially for schools to visit as part of their teaching of Hinduism in their Religious Education Curriculum.\nRenovations.\nThe Ganesh temple has been using a building that was formally a Church and a Community Centre. Hence the interior has been a basic square shape. Reconstruction work began in early 2014, and is nearing completion in January 2015. It will be based more on the style of the traditional South Indian temples."

In addition to the three Challenger titles, Hájek made his debut at Grand Slam level where he defeated Lukáš Dlouhý in straight sets before losing to Fernando González.\nHájek was unable to follow up the previously successful year in 2007, but he achieved his best result at Grand Slam level, where he made the third round at Roland Garros where he defeated Thomas Johansson and Bohdan Ulihrach before retiring against Marcos Baghdatis with a shoulder injury. Since then Hájek has had injury problems with the shoulder and problems with his heart.\nAt the beginning of 2009 Hájek started the year ranked at 474 and has been playing on the Challenger circuit and he has been playing qualifications and after qualifying for the main draw in Athens he lost in the semi-finals to Rui Machado. Hájek won the Ostrava Challenger after qualifying defeating Ivan Dodig 7–5, 6–1.

He also reached his first quarter-final on the ATP tour at Munich losing to Youzhny again.

He is probably most well known for his stint as the interim head coach at St. John's during the 2003–2004 season.\nClark was hired by Mike Jarvis as an assistant at George Washington in 1994, and followed him to St. John's in 1998. In December 2003, Jarvis was fired after a 2-4 start, and Clark was named as his replacement for the rest of the season. Under Clark, the Red Storm were fairly competitive in their first eight Big East Conference games, despite losing each one.\nHowever, the season came unraveled on February 4, after a loss to Pittsburgh. Six players broke curfew and went to a club in downtown Pittsburgh. They took a woman they met there back to the team hotel for sex. Ultimately, one player was expelled, another withdrew from school, another was suspended from school for at least one year, two others were kicked off the team for the rest of the season and another was suspended for two games. School officials did not hold Clark responsible for the incident.\nAfter team captain Andre Stanley was declared academically ineligible, the Red Storm were cut down to only eight players, including four walk-ons. Ultimately, the Red Storm finished 6-21, including a 1-15 record in Big East play—the worst season in the program's history."

For example, players can manage either the Brooklyn Dodgers or New York Yankees in a rematch of the 1955 World Series. Two players can manage against each other, one player can manage against a computer manager, or the computer can manage both teams.\nGame play is limited to managerial decisions: setting lineups, pitching changes, pinch hitters and other substitutions, defensive positioning, and offensive decisions such as when to bunt, steal or hit and run.\nReception.\n\"Computer Baseball\" was given the award for \"Best Computer Sports Game\" in 1982 at the 3rd annual Arcade Awards. Judges described the game as computerized version of the traditional statistical-replay table sports game, and praised it for its \"attractive and easy-to-use form\".\n\"Computer Gaming World\" stated in 1985 that \"Computer Baseball\", despite its age, \"remains one of the best on the market\". It cited the clear documentation and compiling and printing of individual statistics as strengths, while the weak computer opponent was a weakness. \"Ahoy!\" wrote in 1986 that the game \"isn't as pretty as \"MicroLeague Baseball\", but it may be better for those who replay entire seasons ... its mathematical model considers more statistical categories than other programs\". The magazine noted the large number of supplemental disks available from SSI.\nThe game sold more than 30,000 copies."

In China, in which \"Warcraft III\" was extremely popular due to it being easily available through piracy, fans and users often used an alternative client due to the country's poor internet connections to the outside world. Around 3,000,000 copies of the game were sold in the country. 500,000 Chinese competed in the Chinese qualifiers for the 2006 World Cyber Games. The amount of prize money through the years has been significant with top players winning hundreds of thousands of dollars. As usual in competitive gaming, income for \"Warcraft 3\" professional players flowed from various sources like team salaries from pro-gaming teams and sponsorships usually computer technology related. A famous example was the Danish gaming organization known as Meet Your Makers which boasted of paying their players 300,000 on an annual basis. Similar to older games with huge competitive scenes like Starcraft:Brood War and \"Counter-Strike 1.6\", the popularity of \"Warcraft 3\" steadily declined and towards the end of the previous decade almost all tournaments and players were Chinese. After 2010, with \"Starcraft 2\", \"League of Legends\", and \"Dota 2\" being released and becoming popular, \"Warcraft 3\" gave up its position as one of the prime eSports titles.\nWarcraft III World Championships.\nThere have been various Warcraft III world championships, see Warcraft III World Championships for an overview.\nKorean Warcraft III Championships.\nDue to the intensely competitive nature of Korean televised competition, the top tier tournaments are often considered on the same level as world championships, see Korean Warcraft III Championships for an overview of prominent Korean competitions.\nProfessional Warcraft III squads.\nVarious gaming teams have a professional Warcraft III squad. These squads represent their team in such leagues as the Warcraft 3 Champions League and the NGL One professional league. Players also represent their team in various individual leagues.

Frank was educated at Patrician Brothers' school, Redfern and Marist College Kogarah, and remained a committed Roman Catholic throughout his life.\nFrank Farrell married Phyllis Dorothy Read (1912–1981) on 11 November 1944 and the couple had two sons and two daughters.\nFootballer.\nFarrell was a rugby league footballer with a long sporting career. He rose through the ranks to become \"The Greatest Bluebag of them all.\" Graded in 1936, he made his début for the Newtown Rugby League Football Club's first-grade team in the 1938 NSWRFL season. He played his entire New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership career of over 250 games with the Newtown club. He made his state representative debut for New South Wales against Queensland in 1939 and went on to play thirteen career matches for his state. He became captain of the club in 1942, leading them to victory in the 1943 NSWRFL season Premiership Final against North Sydney. One of Farrell's closest and lifelong friends, Frank Hyde, was his opposing captain that day.\nFarrell was captain in 1944 when Newtown finished the regular season on top of the table. Decimated by injuries and the active-duty call up of servicemen Len Smith and Herb Narvo who had starred for them all season the Bluebags were beaten by Balmain 16–19 in a Final. Newtown exercised their \"right of challenge\" as minor premiers and called for a Grand final in which Farrell led the side. Balmain again prevailed in a low scoring match when their representative centre Joe Jorgenson kicked two late penalty goals to give the Tigers a 12–8 win. In a famous incident during a game on 28 July 1945, he was accused of biting off a portion of St. George player Bill McRitchie's ear during a match at Henson Park. He formally denied the allegation at the time. It took seven months for the New South Wales Rugby League judiciary to finalise their inquiry and Farrell was found not guilty.\nAfter the war, he made his international representative debut for Australia in the 1946 Test series against the Great Britain Lions, becoming Kangaroo No. 223. He played in all three matches of the series. It was a violent era and every team had three or four 'enforcers'. Greg Ellis, who was the Newtown ball boy in Bumper's day, said he only ever saw two blokes get the better of him. One was George Jardine, of St. George, and the other was the enormous British prop Frank Whitcombe. During the brutal exchanges in the first test Bumper was 'King Hit' by Whitcombe when the unfortunate St John's ambulanceman ran on to treat him, a still groggy Farrell lashed out at him mistaking him for Whitcombe.\nFarrell made another Test appearance against New Zealand in 1948. Farrell was captain-coach of the Newtown club from 1946 to 1951 and in that six-year period the club made the finals on four occasions. He retired in 1951 and was at that time the first Sydney top-grade player with 250 grade games for his club. He remains today the only player to top 200 first-grade appearances for Newtown. He later served a long term as President of the Newtown Jets. Former Mayor of Newtown Joe Bugler described him as the \"greatest man God ever put breath into\". Other officials who served alongside him at times of various crises recall the way in which his loyalty, service and dedication helped guide the Newtown Jets club through whatever travails it had to face.\nPoliceman.\nWhile playing football, Farrell was employed in the New South Wales Police Force in a career that lasted from 1938 to 1976. During his long tenure as sergeant of the 21st Division Darlinghurst (Kings Cross) police station in Sydney he was outwardly respected as an honest and tough member of the community and police force as a member of the Vice Squad. Farrell became one of Sydney's most famous Policemen and was featured in hundreds of media reports between the 1940s and the mid-1970s. His highest rank was Inspector 1st Class.\nHowever articles including two published by the ABC, and oral history interviews with long-term residents of the Kings Cross precinct uncover the dark underside as the community remember and recite Farrell's legendary status for his harassment and intimidation of local business people and residents, particularly anyone considered \"bohemian\", \"Some of the gambling dives were chockablock with thuggish cops, like Bumper Farrell, whose reputation for turncoat behaviour was legendary. Farrell hunted vagrants (and anyone he didn't like the look of, myself included) to boost the score of arrests at Paddington Police Station, while turning a blind eye to grander villainy\".\n\"The Darlinghurst police back in those days with Bumper Farrell, they weren't very nice. They'd put you in a steel-built cabinet and rock you round the room. Then they'd get you out and throw you on the ground and get telephone books and jump on top of the phone books. But they'd never leave a mark\". Debra Deveraux, George Negus Tonight, ABC, 2004.\nIn the 1950s a scandal was quickly quashed when the cover of Melbourne newspaper \"Truth\" ran the headline \"Sex Chocolates: Anna Hoffmann Strikes Again\" Anna Hoffman was a supposed vagrant working as a prostitute, when she allegedly spiked Farrell's food with marijuana during a tryst with him, and recorded the event with equipment placed under her bed.\nThis wasn't Hoffman's first experience with the legal system; after a few run-ins with the police force and allegedly threatening to expose details of corruption, this was second time around in a court room for her since 1955. She was allegedly deported, never to set foot in Australia again. The incident was efficiently brushed under the carpet in record time.\nBill Jenkings, a well-known Australian writer and newspaper reporter, refused to believe allegations about the involvement of Frank \"Bumper\" Farrell in corrupt activities – having known him personally for 40 years. Jenkings said in his biography \"As Crime Goes By..\" (Ironbark Press, 1992) that the Queens of Sydney's underworld, Tilly Devine and Kate Leigh, constantly earned Bumper Farrell's wrath. \"He'd run them in every chance that he got.\"\nA biography called \"Bumper: The Life and Times of Frank Bumper Farrell\" (2011), by author Larry Writer, states \"he [Farrell] enforced law the 'Bumper' way, with his fists and boots, and by his own moral code, which while terribly politically incorrect, was certainly effective. He was the toughest, roughest street cop that Australia has ever seen.\" Farrell was awarded the Queen's Police Medal for Distinguished Service on 1 January 1976.\nDeath and legacy.\nFrank Farrell died suddenly of a heart attack at his home on 23 April 1985. His funeral service was attended by many police and football colleagues and was widely reported in the national media. He was later buried at Mona Vale Cemetery on 3 May 1985. Frank Farrell was survived by his four children and many grandchildren.\nSays Terry Williams in \"Through Blue Eyes\", his history of the Newtown team: \"[Farrell] was no saint, but his flaws made him all the more loved. Bumper neither sought nor claimed perfection, but the qualities he brought to Newtown on and off the field added lustre to the game and the club and helped make Newtown what it is today. Frank Farrell passed away in 1985, but he had entered the pantheon of Bluebag Legends well before then and remains the ultimate Newtown icon.\" His death notice in the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" described Frank Farrell as \"The Greatest Bluebag of All\".\nFarrell's grandson Jack Elsegood became a prominent rugby league footballer as well.\nIn 2008, Rugby League's centenary year in Australia, Farrell was named at prop forward in both the NSW Police and Newtown Jets Teams of the Century. He was named captain in the Newtown Team.\nFarrell's name was immortalised in Farrell Avenue, in Darlinghurst. He was further immortalised by Sydney folk punk rockers The Rumjacks in their song \"Sober and Godless.\" In the song, from the album of the same name, the singer recounts how \"I could dead-lift a barrel, / Flog the arse off 'Bumper' Farrell...\""

        "text": "The 1999 Giro d'Italia was the 82nd edition of the Giro. It began on May 15 with a mass-start stage that stretched from Agrigento to Modica. The race came to a close on June 6 with a mass-start stage that ended in the Italian city of Milan. Eighteen teams entered the race that was won by the Italian Ivan Gotti (sub judice )of the team. Second and third were the Italians riders Paolo Savoldelli and Gilberto Simoni. Marco Pantani is credited with four high mountain stage victories.\nLate in the race Marco Pantani was accused of using EPO and was expelled either as the result of a failed doping control, or due to a conspiracy involving drug tests being manipulated.\nIn the race's other classifications, rider Chepe González won the mountains classification, Laurent Jalabert of the team won the points classification, and Team Polti rider Fabrizio Guidi won the intergiro classification. finished as the winners of the \"Trofeo Fast Team\" classification, ranking each of the eighteen teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time. The other team classification, the \"Trofeo Super Team\" classification, where the teams' riders are awarded points for placing within the top twenty in each stage and the points are then totaled for each team was won by Team Polti.\nTeams.\nA total of 18 teams were invited to participate in the 1999 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, so the Giro began with a peloton of 162 cyclists. Out of the 162 riders that started this edition of the Giro d'Italia, a total of 116 riders made it to the finish in Milan.\nThe 18 teams that took part in the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the 1999 Giro d'Italia was unveiled by race director Carmine Castellano on 14 November 1998 in Milan. It contained four time trial events, there of which were individual and one a team event. There were eleven stages containing high mountains, of which five had summit finishes: stage 5, to Massiccio del Sirino; stage 8, to Gran Sasso d'Italia; stage 15, to Santuario di Oropa; stage 19, to Alpe di Pampeago; and stage 20, to Madonna di Campiglio. The organizers chose to include one rest day. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was shorter, contained the one more rest day, as well as one more time trial event.\nRace overview.\nDefending champion Marco Pantani, leading the general classification in Madonna di Campiglio (20th stage), was disqualified for an excessive hematocrit level before stage 21. The entire Mercatone Uno–Bianchi (Pantani's team) withdrew from the Giro. This left the race open for Gotti to capture his second overall title and wear the final pink jersey as Giro Champion for the 2nd time in three years.\nClassification leadership.\nFour different jerseys were worn during the 1999 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nFor the points classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The intergiro classification was marked by a blue jersey. The calculation for the intergiro is similar to that of the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders pass through a point and where their time is stopped. As the race goes on, their times compiled and the person with the lowest time is the leader of the intergiro classification and wears the blue jersey. Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run."

        "text": "Fred Lee Valentine (January 19, 1935 – December 26, 2022) was an American professional baseball outfielder. He appeared in 533 games over all or part of seven seasons in Major League Baseball for the Baltimore Orioles (1959, 1963, and 1968) and Washington Senators (1964–1968). He also played one season for the Hanshin Tigers of Nippon Professional Baseball in 1970. Valentine was a switch hitter who threw right-handed; he was listed as tall and .\nValentine attended Tennessee State University and signed with Baltimore in 1956. After completing four seasons in the Orioles' farm system, he was called to Baltimore for his first MLB trial during the final month of the 1959 season. In limited service (12 games total, with seven starts in the outfield), he batted .316 with two multi-hit games. He then returned to the top level of minor league baseball, and would not get his second chance with the Orioles until his recall in June 1963. Again, he played sparingly (getting into only 26 games), but he batted .268 as a backup outfielder and pinch hitter. His contract was then sold to the Senators in October. In 1964, Valentine finally spent extended time on a big-league roster, getting into 102 games and substituting in all three outfield positions. But he struggled offensively, hitting only .226, and was demoted to Triple-A Hawaii for 1965. He then had a banner season with the Islanders, slugging 25 home runs, batting .324, and leading the Pacific Coast League in runs scored (116), earning him a September callup with the 1965 Senators.\nThat campaign led to Valentine's career-best season, in 1966. He played in 146 games, starting 127 of them as either Washington's center fielder or right fielder. At the plate, he set personal bests in home runs (16) and runs batted in (59), while hitting a robust .276, second on the team to slugger Frank Howard's .278. He led the Senators in runs scored (77), hits (140) and doubles (29). Then, in 1967, Valentine returned for another season as the Senators' \"fourth\" outfielder: he played in 150 games in all, and got into 136 games as an outfielder with 111 starts, most of these coming in center and right fields. However, his offensive production fell off in every category, as he hit .234 with 11 home runs. Returning to Washington in 1968, he appeared in 26 games in the outfield during the season's first two months. But he again struggled at the plate, batting .238.\nHe was traded back to the Orioles from the Senators for Bruce Howard before the trade deadline on June 15, 1968. His acquisition by the Orioles was insurance in case Paul Blair was ordered to report for active duty with the United States Army. Valentine then concluded his MLB career as a reserve outfielder, hitting only .187 for Baltimore. On the cusp of winning three straight American League pennants (1969–1971), Baltimore outrighted Valentine to Triple-A Rochester for 1969. That season, the 34-year-old enjoyed one last productive minor-league campaign, hitting .287 with 18 homers. He then played a final year of professional baseball in Japan, where he batted .246 with 11 long balls for Hanshin.\nAll told, Valentine batted .247 in major league action, collecting 360 hits, with 56 career doubles, ten triples and 36 homers. He had 138 runs batted in.\nValentine died on December 26, 2022, at the age of 87."

        "text": "The Tunisia men's national basketball team (), nicknamed \"The Eagles of Carthage\", represents Tunisia in international basketball. The team is governed by the Tunisia Basketball Federation (FTBB). To date, she has taken part in the regional championship the AfroBasket 23 times. In terms of the number of successful performances, it is inferior to the traditionally strong teams of Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire, and Egypt. In 2011, the Tunisian national team became the champion of Africa for the first time in its history, defeating the Angola team in the AfroBasket 2011 final. The team's previous success was silver at the home Africa Championship 1965. The team also won bronze medals in the 1970, 1974, 2009 and 2015 competitions.\nDespite fairly successful performances (the Tunisian national team never finished lower than eighth), the team was unable to repeat or even come close to the successes of the 1970s. The success of the 2009 was quite unexpected, when the team took third place at the AfroBasket 2009. Following the results of the draw, forward Amine Rzig was included in the symbolic team of the tournament, and the team in the preliminary round won 4 games with two defeats, but in three matches the Tunisian team won with a difference of two or one point. Tunisia reached the quarter-finals for the first time since 1974, where they defeated Mali by one point. And although Tunisia lost to Angola in the semi-finals, Cameroon was beaten in the bronze medal match, and the Tunisian team automatically qualified for the 2010 FIBA World Championship in Turkey. This was also the first time in the team's history that they qualified for the world championship. However, the team performed poorly at the World Cup, losing all five matches in Group B and eventually finishing in 24th place. In 2017 as co-hosts, Tunisia won its second AfroBasket by beating Nigeria 77–65 in the final. It retains its title in 2021 by beating Ivory Coast in the final with a score of 78–75.\nHistory.\nIn 2011, they won their first ever FIBA Africa Championship, after beating Angola in the final. Their previous best finish was at the FIBA Africa Championship 1965, when they won the silver medal as the host country. They also won a bronze medal at the FIBA Africa Championship 1970 and FIBA Africa Championship 1974.\nAlthough the Tunisians never finished worse than eighth in any of their succeeding appearances, they were not able to break onto the podium again until a surprise bronze medal run at the FIBA Africa Championship 2009. Led by All-Tournament First Team forward Amine Rzig, the Tunisians went 4–2 in the preliminary rounds, winning three games by two points or less. They reached the semi-finals for only the second time since 1974, by another slim margin – this time a one-point victory over Mali. Although they were defeated by Angola in the semi-finals, the Tunisians topped Cameroon in the bronze medal game, to claim Africa's third and final automatic berth in the 2010 FIBA World Championship – its first ever FIBA World Cup berth. The Tunisians struggled to compete in the World Championship, losing all five of their games, and finishing last in Group B, and 24th overall. Yet, after almost forty years of mediocrity in Africa, Tunisia has become one of the continent's prime competitors again. Its appearances at the global stage have become a new milestone in the team's history.\nCompetitive record.\nUnlike other team sports, where Tunisia is well positioned at the regional level, the Tunisian men's basketball team has not managed to expand its list of trophies even if at the continental level it can consider among the most awarded countries. Finalist of the African championship held in home in 1965, four times third and twice fourth, Tunisia did not succeed in becoming African champion of the discipline until 2011 without however maintaining its rank since, during the following edition, it is relegated to ninth place.\nAt the Arab level, the prize list is more extensive with four champion titles, in 1981, 1983, 2008 and 2009, a second place and three third places. On 28 August 2011, the team won the AfroBasket for the first time after defeating Angola 67–56 in the final and qualified for the 2012 Summer Olympics.\nIn 2017 as co-hosts, Tunisia won its second AfroBasket by beating Nigeria 77–65 in the final. It retains its title in 2021 by beating Ivory Coast in the final with a score of 78–75.

Once there, he meets and eventually becomes a mentor to David Smith, a medical resident at the hospital where Verghese worked and a brilliant tennis player recovering from drug addiction.\nBecause of his own love for the game and as part of his effort to reach out to the troubled resident, Verghese begins to play singles tennis regularly during their free time outside the hospital. What starts as a casual game between the two men eventually develops into a complex ritual that allows them to develop a deep friendship and understanding of the pressures they each face. In the hospital, Verghese is the teacher and Smith the student. On the court, however, Smith, the one-time professional player, becomes the teacher. The story tells of their all too brief friendship as Smith battles and eventually succumbs to his disease, and Verghese's helpless attempts to intervene.\nWhile cited as fiction, \"The Tennis Partner\" is heavily autobiographical. In 2019, it was ranked by \"Slate\" as one of the 50 greatest nonfiction books of the past 25 years."

It was held at its traditional home, the Winter Gardens, Blackpool, between 22 and 28 July 2007. James Wade won his first major title, defeating Terry Jenkins 18–7 in the final.\nDefending and eight times champion, Phil Taylor suffered a semi-final defeat to Jenkins, meaning that he had surrendered both the World Championship and World Matchplay titles for the first time since the PDC began in 1994. Raymond van Barneveld, who went into this event having won the first three Sky TV majors of the year (World Championship, UK Open and Las Vegas Desert Classic) saw his hopes of the clean-sweep evaporate with a quarter-final defeat to Adrian Lewis. Barneveld was making his debut in the event having failed to qualify in 2006.\nBoth Lewis and Jenkins suffered hangovers from their victories over the two favourites as they lost their next matches - with James Wade capitalising. He beat Lewis in the semi-final and Jenkins in the final. Wade became the youngest winner of a PDC televised title at the age of 24 and also rose to number three in the world rankings.\nTelevision coverage.\nSky Sports broadcast the event live in the UK &amp; Ireland for the 14th year running. The final between Wade &amp; Jenkins achieved viewing figures of 183,000 - although that was surpassed by the quarter-finals on Thursday (188,000) and the semi-finals on Friday received the highest viewing figures with 240,000 (the third highest-rated programme on Sky Sports 1 for that week) "

        "title": "Ice Hockey Hair",
        "text": "Ice Hockey Hair is an EP by the Welsh alternative rock band Super Furry Animals, released in 1998. The record contains four songs which the band felt did not fit in with either their previous album, 1997's \"Radiator\", or its follow-up \"Guerrilla\". The title track refers to an alternative name for the mullet hairstyle. The EP's opening song, \"Smokin, was commissioned by British television station Channel 4 for a programme about sloth presented by Howard Marks. \"Ice Hockey Hair\" was later included on 'greatest hits' compilation \"\", issued in 2004, while \"Smokin appeared on 1998's B-side and rarities compilation \"Out Spaced\".\nThe EP received mostly positive reviews, being awarded 'single of the week' by the \"NME\", and appearing at number two in the magazine's Single of the Year list for 1998. The record also appeared in the 1998 single of the year lists issued by both the \"Melody Maker\" and \"Select\". Promotional music videos were issued for both \"Ice Hockey Hair\" and \"Smokin and are included on the DVD version of \"Songbook...\". The former was directed by Daf Palfrey while the latter was directed by Peter Gray.\nRecording and themes.\nThe first track on the EP, \"Smokin, was commissioned by British television station Channel 4 for a programme about sloth presented by Howard Marks as part of a series on the seven deadly sins. The band went into Grassroots, a community recording studio in Cardiff, in June 1997 and looped a sample of the Black Uhuru track \"I Love King Selassie\", playing along and writing \"Smokin \"completely spontaneously\". According to singer Gruff Rhys the song is \"really light and up\" as a result of being recorded in the summer. The track's lyrics refer to smoking cannabis, with Rhys stating that it \"seems ridiculous that you can't do what you want with a plant that grows naturally\" in reference to the drug's illegal status in many countries. Rhys has claimed that he does not consider the track to be subversive, however — it is about the band's own drug use and he doesn't \"expect everyone who buys the record to do the same. They'd be quite sad if they did\".\nChief lyric writer Rhys has stated that, whereas he might \"empty parts of [his] emotional state\" into some songs, \"Ice Hockey Hair's\" title track was written in the \"instant pop music\" tradition. The track was originally called \"Naff Gan\" (a.k.a. \"The Naff Song\") as the band felt it \"had so many naff, cheesy things about it\" before being renamed \"Ice Hockey Hair\" following a conversation with a Swedish football player who said that having 'ice hockey hair', an alternative name for the mullet hairstyle, was a really naff thing to do in his home country. Rhys has described the song as a \"Badfinger-style power ballad\" and claimed that it is about \"someone who's sunk so low they're asking advice off a woman with ice hockey hair\". The track was recorded at Orinonco Studios, London.\nThe band felt that \"Ice Hockey Hair\" and \"Smokin were \"light relief\" and needed to be released so that they could concentrate on their next album, \"Guerrilla\", with Rhys stating that the \"EP was a good chance to do something in isolation, because the tracks on it won't fit in with the new album, and they didn't fit in with the old one\". The EP is completed by \"Let's Quit Smoking\", a remix of \"Smokin, and \"Mu-Tron\", a largely instrumental track named after the Mu-Tron guitar effects pedal and written by keyboardist Cian Ciaran.\nRelease and reception.\n\"Ice Hockey Hair\" was released on CD, 7\" and cassette on 25 May 1998 and reached number 12 on the UK Singles Chart. The CD version of the EP has four tracks while the 7\" and cassette feature only \"Ice Hockey Hair\" and \"Smokin. A 12\" vinyl release of \"Ice Hockey Hair\" was issued in June 1998 and includes all four songs from the CD version albeit in a different track order. The proverb \"Decadence may not be seen as a wholly negative process neither should it be viewed as a terminal state. It's a stage in the process of regeneration and renewal\" was to have been featured on \"Ice Hockey Hair\" sleeve but the band eventually decided against the idea as they felt the phrase was too long. \"Ice Hockey Hair\" was included on the band's 'greatest hits' compilation \"\", issued in 2004, while \"Smokin was included on 1998's B-side and rarities compilation \"Out Spaced\". The Wildhearts recorded a cover of \"Ice Hockey Hair\" for their 2008 album \"Stop Us If You've Heard This One Before, Vol 1.\"\nThe \"Melody Maker\" called the \"Ice Hockey Hair\" EP \"brilliant, predictably freakish weirdness\" and described it as a cross between The Beach Boys and techno while guest reviewers Therapy? claimed to like \"Smokin better than \"Ice Hockey Hair\" which they thought was \"full-on smoker music\". \"Vox\" stated that \"Ice Hockey Hair\" proved the band's \"placid casual grasp of the concept of genius\", describing the title track as a \"gooey, melted mix of Queen, ELO, Pavement and [...] Techno Animal\" and \"Smokin, which they felt was the EP's stand-out song, as \"deranged disco delirium\". The \"NME\" felt that the EP showed the Super Furry Animals had fulfilled their early promise and was the result of the band having \"ideas like most people have cups of tea\", awarding \"Ice Hockey Hair\" 'single of the week' in their 23 May 1998 issue. The magazine called \"Smokin \"compact disco\" and stated that \"Mu-Tron\" was an \"ugly name for a beautiful song\". \"Ice Hockey Hair\" was described as a combination of Queen, ELO, Wings, and \"mad techno squalling\" which sounds like \"Elton John's glitter-coated grand piano\" falling from the sky. AllMusic described the \"Ice Hockey Hair\" EP as \"another fun, cool group of songs from a band that can seemingly do no wrong\" which bridges the gap between the \"spaced-out rock\" of 1997's \"Radiator\" and the \"pop/rock electronic experimentation\" of 1999's \"Guerrilla\". The website did take issue with the short length of the record however, suggesting that the Super Furry Animals' music works best \"in large doses of pop/rock gem upon pop/rock gem\".\nIn their review of \"Songbook: The Singles, Vol. 1\", Drowned in Sound claimed that \"Ice Hockey Hair\" \"could be the most perfect thing you'll ever set ears upon\" while the BBC viewed the \"sublime\" track as one of the record's highlights. Also reviewing \"Songbook...\", Pitchfork Media called the song a \"non-album gem\", \"The Washington Post\" called it \"gorgeous\" and AllMusic referred to it as a masterpiece. Reviewing \"Outspaced\", the \"Melody Maker\" described the \"filthily funky\" \"Smokin as brilliant and \"Select\" called it one of the \"joyous pinnacles\" of the album, suggesting that the track was inspired by P-Funk. The \"NME\" however, called \"Smokin \"sludgy\" and suggested that it was \"Outspaced\" \"fairly naff nadir\".\nStylus Magazine named \"Ice Hockey Hair\" in a list of \"Ten essential singles/EPs\" released by Creation Records in a 2003 article about the label. \"Ice Hockey Hair\" was included in The Pitchfork 500, a list of the greatest songs released from 1977 to 2006, published by Pitchfork Media in 2008.\nMusic videos.\n\"Ice Hockey Hair\".\nThe promotional music video for \"Ice Hockey Hair\" was directed by Daf Palfrey and appears on the DVD version of the band's 'greatest hits' album \"\".\nThe video begins with silent footage of five characters, who appear in a small white rectangle in the centre of the screen against a black background. The text \"I am like a film strip ... and like a child ... in a thousand lunar parks ... someone is always ... cranking the handle\" appears as the video cuts between shots of each person. \"Ice Hockey Hair\" begins playing approximately 17 seconds into the video. Each character is again seen in a white rectangle in the centre of the screen followed by a shot of a pair of hands holding a strip of photos of that particular person during which red text is displayed showing the character's name. A woman with short blonde hair and a red top, seen holding her head in her hands is introduced as \"The wife\"; a bald man with blood on his head is \"The husband\"; a woman in a white jacket with a blonde mullet hairstyle is \"The mistress\"; a man with thick-rimmed glasses, a white jacket, and red polo neck sweater is \"The voyeur\"; and a man in a red and black tracksuit top with a large scar running from his left eye to right cheek is \"The stalker\". The five characters are all seen singing along to the track individually, again framed in a white rectangle in the centre of the screen. \"The wife\" is twice shown ripping a photograph of her and \"The husband\", while \"The mistress\" is seen sitting on the lap of \"The husband\" in two shots. After 1 minute and 6 seconds the Super Furry Animals are shown playing along to the track on a rotating dancefloor surrounded by photo booths and several dancers in dark clothes. During an instrumental break in the song, at 1 minute 38 seconds, two masked men are shown playing table tennis on another rotating dancefloor with two large fluorescent purple circles in the background. The five characters are then seen walking around the band and stepping into the photo booths that surround them. The text \"Act 1: The kiss\" is shown, after which footage of the Super Furry Animals playing along to the track is intercut with shots of the characters. \"The husband\" and \"The mistress\" kiss while a strip of photos is seen being passed through a pair of hands and \"The voyeur\" is shown using a video camera. The characters move to different photo booths and the title \"Act 2: The stalking\" is displayed. Shots of \"The stalker\" and \"The wife\" are then intercut with shots of the band. The characters again change booths and the title \"Act 3: The murder\" is shown. After quick jump cuts between shots of the band, the masked men playing table tennis and the five characters, \"The voyeur\" is shown pointing his video camera at the motionless body of \"The mistress\" which is laid in a bathtub covered in film stock. More footage of the band follows before \"The husband\" is shown motionless of the floor, surrounded by a white tape outline. The video ends with more jump cuts between the band, the masked table tennis players and the five named characters.\n\"Smokin.\nThe music video for \"Smokin was directed by Peter Gray and also appears on the DVD version of \"Songbook: The Singles, Vol. 1\".\nThe video begins with a shot of the Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appears on the cover of the \"Ice Hockey Hair\" EP. The logo fades out and the camera pans through a crowd of dark figures wearing berets towards a woman standing behind a long, black table. The woman is wearing a short sleeved black dress and has a blonde bob haircut. Her arms and face are illuminated in the otherwise dark room and she is shown walking backwards down the table, giving coloured cards to each of the figures wearing berets. The woman walks up and down the table observing the crowd as they each use the piece of card they were given to make an origami animal. As each person completes a model animal the woman gives them a new piece of coloured card. Approximately two minutes into the video the woman returns to a central position behind the table and looks down at one of the beret wearers. The camera cuts to show him screwing up a piece of green card into a ball which turns into an origami crane and flies away as he opens his hands. The rest of the figures in berets are shown from behind, bowing their heads before the camera cuts to a close up view of several origami animals on the table. These animals also begin to move, and interact with each other until a large red animal arrives. The camera cuts to a close-up of the red animal's head with smoke shown coming from its nose. The next shot shows the origami animals stationary on the table as the camera pans up to the beret wearers who are looking straight ahead while smoke moves across from the right. The woman walks up and down the table giving the beret wearers new pieces of card as they complete more and more origami animals. As the video draws to an end she rapidly piles up the origami animals into a heap in the middle of the table. When all the animals have been collected into the pile the beret wearers bow their heads and the woman puts her arms around the pile and smiles at the camera. In the final shot the woman places her hands on the table and stares at the camera as the video fades out to show the same Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appeared at the very beginning.\nTrack listing.\nAll songs by Super Furry Animals unless otherwise stated."

        "text": "The Bangladesh women's national cricket team () is the team that represents the country of Bangladesh in international women's cricket matches. They made their international debut when they played, and won, two matches against Thailand in July 2007 before participating in and winning the 2007 ACC Women's Tournament. Bangladesh were granted One-Day International (ODI) status in 2011 after finishing fifth in the 2011 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier. They subsequently qualified for the 2014 ICC Women's World Twenty20 as hosts, making their first appearance at a top-level women's international tournament. They have also won the 2018 edition of ACC Women's Asia Cup. This was the only instance in ACC Women's Asia Cup where any team other than India won the tournament. However, they finished fifth in the next edition (2022 edition) of Women's Asia Cup, but has since went on to become one of the most competitive women's cricket teams in Asia.

The team lost all three of its matches, and on debut against Bangladesh were bowled out for nine runs, in a match which took one hour to complete. The squad was said to consist of \"mothers and daughters\", and the captain, Natasha Cherriath, was 12 years old. The team's coach was Smitha Harikrishna who played One Day International (ODI) cricket for India, and another ex-India player, Pramila Bhatt, was involved in a pre-tournament training camp.\nAt the 2009 ACC Women's Twenty20 Championship, the UAE won their first international match, defeating Oman by 49 runs. The team also defeated Kuwait, finishing fourth in its six-team group, and defeated Iran in a play-off to finish 7th overall out of 12 teams. At the 2011 ACC Women's Twenty20 Championship, it placed 9th out of 10 teams and won two matches. At the 2013 ACC Women's Championship in Thailand, the team failed to win a single game, placing 10th out of 11 teams (above Kuwait). UAE won both editions of the Gulf Cricket Council (GCC) Women's Twenty20 Championship held in Oman in 2014 and in Qatar in 2015.\nIn June 2016, two teams from Australia's Women's Big Bash League (WBBL), the Sydney Sixers and the Sydney Thunder, toured UAE for a training camp.

        "text": "The Nepal women's national cricket team () represents Nepal in international women's cricket. They made their international debut in the ACC Women's Tournament in Malaysia in July 2007. Nepal has been participating in various international tournaments since then. Nepal's current captain is Indu Barma, coach is Samson Jung Thapa and manager is Sanjaya Raj Singh.\nIn April 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) granted full Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Nepal women and another international side after 1 July 2018 will be a full WT20I. Nepal made her Twenty20 International debut on 12 January 2019 against China, at the 2019 Thailand Women's T20 Smash in Bangkok. Nepal finished runner-up at the tournament losing to Thailand by 70 runs in the Final.\nOverview.\nWomen's cricket is thriving and the national team (made up of top athletes from other sports) did very well to reach the final of the 2007 ACC Women's Tournament. Nepal won the 2008 ACC Under-19 Women's Championship and defended its title in 2010.\nIn the ACC Women Twenty20 in Malaysia in 2009, Singapore needed two runs off the last over for victory with five wickets intact. Rubina Chhetry was given the 'hopeless' over but she did a miracle by taking five wickets in five balls as the match ended in a draw as she threw a wide. Nepal won the match in bowl-out. With the rare incident, Rubina also became the first Nepalese cricketer, man or woman, to take a hat-trick. \"I have never heard that any team has won the match taking five wickets in the last over, this is very, very rare,\" the then captain Binod Das commented.\nOn 26 April 2018, ICC announced that all the T20 matches played between ICC members will be awarded T20I status starting from 1 July 2018 for women's cricket, as a result Nepal played their first T20I match against China on January 12, 2019.\nIn December 2020, the ICC announced the qualification pathway for the 2023 ICC Women's T20 World Cup. Nepal were named in the 2021 ICC Women's T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier regional group, alongside seven other teams.\nAt the 2022 ACC Women's T20 Championship, Nepal reached the semifinals before being eliminated, losing to the UAE not on the field, but rather on a lower net-run-rate than the latter, due to a rain-out.\nIn late May to early June 2023, the Nepal women returned to action for the first time since 2022, with a 5-match T20 series against Malaysia, winning 3-2. Later in June 2023, it was announced that Nepal would replace Thailand at the 2023 ACC Women's T20 Emerging Teams Asia Cup, due to reported visa issues with the latter team. This was announced on short notice, as the announcement was made on the 8th, and their first match would be on the 13th of the month. Ultimately, they would only get to play one match against Pakistan A, losing 87-78, with their other scheduled matches against India A and Hong Kong rained out.\nCurrent squad.\nThe following is a list of players who were in the squad for the 2024 ACC Women's Premier Cup, were centrally contracted by the Cricket Association of Nepal for 2024.\nNote - Sana Praveen, Shristi Jaisi &amp; Jyotsinka Marasini are also given Emerging Category Contract but has not played for Nepal national team yet.\nPay grade.\nCAN awards central contracts to its players, their pay is graded according to the importance of the player.

        "title": "Thailand women's national cricket team",
        "text": "The Thailand women's national cricket team is the team that represents the country of Thailand in international women's cricket matches. Thailand is one of the strongest associate teams in women's international cricket and has been ranked as high as tenth in the ICC Women's T20I rankings.\nA member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1995, Thailand's women team made their international debut when they played, and lost, two matches against Bangladesh in July 2007. The team hosted and won the 2013 ACC Women's Championship to qualify for its first ICC global tournament, the 2013 World Twenty20 Qualifier. Thailand was runner-up at the 2019 edition of the tournament and qualified for the 2020 ICC Women's T20 World Cup in Australia, the first appearance by Thailand in any cricket world championship. The team was awarded women's One Day International (ODI) status in 2022 and received their first ODI Ranking in November of 2022.\nHistory.\nThe team's first international tournament outside of Asian Cricket Council regional events was the 2013 World Twenty20 Qualifier, in which they placed fifth out of eight teams. The team was less successful at the 2015 edition of the tournament, which it hosted, winning only one match (against the Netherlands) to finish seventh.\nIn May 2016, Sri Lankan fast bowler Janak Gamage was named as a head coach of the team. In February 2017, Thailand played their first 50-over match, when they faced India in the 2017 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier in Sri Lanka. India won the match by 9 wickets. In August 2017, Thailand won the gold medal in the women's tournament at the 2017 Southeast Asian Games, going undefeated from four matches.\nIn April 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) granted full Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Thailand women and another international side since 1 July 2018 have been full WT20Is.\nOn 9 June 2018, during the 2018 Women's Twenty20 Asia Cup, Thailand beat Sri Lanka by four wickets to register their first ever win against a Full Member side. In February 2019, they won the 2019 ICC Women's Qualifier Asia, therefore progressing to both the 2019 ICC Women's World Twenty20 Qualifier and the 2021 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier tournaments. In August 2019, during the 2019 Netherlands Women's Quadrangular Series, they won their 17th win in a row, breaking the previous record of 16 consecutive wins in WT20I cricket set by Australia. Thailand qualified to 2020 T20 World Cup in Australia after finished in top two in 2019 ICC Women's World Twenty20 Qualifier.\nOn 3 March 2020 at the Sydney Showground Stadium, Thailand scored 150 runs for three wickets against Pakistan, the highest total for the team in Women's T20 World Cup and at that ground, before the match was abandoned due to rain. Natthakan Chantam scored 56 to register Thailand's first Women's T20 World Cup half-century; she and Nattaya Boochatham, who scored 44, combined for an opening partnership of 93. Ironically, this would be Thailand's highest WT20 score until the following year, and was Thailand's only no-result until 2023.\nIn 2021, the Thai team embarked on a 15-match tour of Zimbabwe and South Africa to prepare for the Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier, held November 2021 in Harare, Zimbabwe. At the qualifier, the team was leading Group B with three wins from four matches, when the tournament was called off, due to concerns about a new COVID variant and travel restrictions. As a consequence, the three remaining places in the World Cup were handed to Bangladesh, Pakistan and the West Indies on the basis of their Women's One Day International rankings, and Thailand, which had beaten Bangladesh but did not have such a ranking, missed out, not only on the World Cup, but also on the next round of the ICC Women's Championship. Prior to this, no team had ever won at least 3 of their first 4 matches of a qualifier without ultimately qualifying for the World Cup, and at the point the qualifiers were abandoned, Thailand would have had at least two points carried forward to the unplayed Super Six round from the aforementioned win over Bangladesh, and would only have needed to not finish last in that round to qualify for the Women's Championship. According to women's cricket historian Raf Nicholson, of Bournemouth University in England, that outcome set back women's cricket in Thailand by three years. As the use of ODI rankings meant that Thailand (and other associate member nations) would never have been able to qualify for either event, regardless of their results, in light of the cancellation, this decision has been criticized as \"utterly disgraceful (and) utterly farcical\".\nAs a result of the controversial circumstances of Thailand's failure to qualify for either event, Cricket Association of Thailand president Ravi Sehgal was reported in April 2022 as saying \"We should have been given a fair chance to qualify\", and it was also reported that he had petitioned the ICC and board directors in December with an impassioned plea for Thailand to be granted ODI status. In May 2022, the ICC announced Thailand as one of five women's sides to gain Women's One Day International (ODI) status. Netherlands, Papua New Guinea, Scotland and the United States are the other four teams.\nIn October 2022, Thailand qualified for the semifinals of the 2022 Women's Twenty20 Asia Cup, aided by their first-ever win over Pakistan, in their first encounter since the abandoned match in Sydney. In November, it was announced that the Netherlands would play 8 matches against the Thai team in Chiang Mai that month, 4 each of ODIs (Thailand's first since earning status) and WT20Is. Thailand won all four of the ODIs, and three of the four WT20Is, with the Netherlands earning their first-ever win over Thailand in the 2nd WT20I.\nIn February 2023, it was reported that the Thai women's team were set for their first tour of Ireland, to play three 50-over ODI matches and two T20Is in June; however, it would later be reported that the series \"was cancelled due to date clashes with the Asia Cup\", as Thailand was scheduled to complete in the 2023 ACC Womens T20 Emerging Teams Asia Cup in June; however, just days before the Emerging Teams Asia Cup, Thailand withdrew from the event, citing visa issues. In March, it was reported that Thailand was to host Zimbabwe for 3 ODIs in April, later amended to 3 ODIs and 4 WT20Is. In May, it was announced that Thailand would tour the Netherlands in July for a second ODI series with the Netherlands, and a trilateral T20 series with both teams and Scotland.\nIn February 2024, the team participated in the 2024 ACC Premier Cup, which also served as a qualification pathway for the 2024 Women's Asia Cup. In late 2022, the ACC had published an updated pathway structure and calendar, whereby the two finalists of the ACC Premier Cup would qualify for the Women's Asia Cup; As a result, upon their loss to the United Arab Emirates in the Premier Cup semi-final, it was reported that Thailand would not qualify for the 2024 Asia Cup. However, at the end of March 2024, the ACC retroactively awarded the semi-finalists of the 2024 Premier Cup qualification to the expanded eight-team 2024 Women's Asia Cup. This confirmed Nepal and Thailand as additional participants, and will mark Thailand's fifth appearance in the tournament.\nRecords and statistics.\nInternational Match Summary — Thailand Women\n\"Last updated 29 April 2024\"\nOne-Day International.\nODI record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to WODI #1324.

Almost a year prior to the 1989 NHL Entry Draft, the Edmonton Oilers traded \"The Great One\" Wayne Gretzky, along with Marty McSorley and Mike Krushelnyski, to the Los Angeles Kings for Jimmy Carson, Martin Gelinas, $15 million in cash, and the Kings' first-round draft picks in 1989, 1991, and 1993.

        "text": "The 2009 UEFA Champions League final was played on 27 May 2009 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, Italy. The match determined the winners of the 2008–09 season of the UEFA Champions League, a tournament for the top football clubs in Europe. The match was won by Barcelona of Spain, who beat England's Manchester United 2–0. Samuel Eto'o opened the scoring in the 10th minute, and Lionel Messi added another goal 20 minutes from the end to earn Barcelona a historic treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, a feat never before achieved by a Spanish club. The match was refereed by Swiss referee Massimo Busacca.\nThis was Barcelona's third victory in the competition, 17 years after they first won the European Cup in 1992. Manchester United went into the match as the competition's defending champions, the first defending champions to reach the final since Juventus in 1997. Manchester United also sought to be the first team to retain the European Cup since A.C. Milan in 1990. It was the fifth year in a row in which the final involved at least one English team. The Stadio Olimpico had hosted three previous Champions League finals, in 1977, 1984 and 1996.\nAs winners of the 2008–09 Champions League, Barcelona later played against 2008–09 UEFA Cup winners Shakhtar Donetsk in the 2009 UEFA Super Cup, and they represented UEFA at the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup. For winning the final, Barcelona won €7 million in prize money, and Manchester United received €4 million as runners-up.\nBackground.\nBarcelona and Manchester United had previously faced each other nine times in European competitions: three times in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and six times in the UEFA Champions League. Of those nine matches, Manchester United had recorded three wins to Barcelona's two, with the remaining four matches finishing in draws. The only time that the two teams met in a final came in 1991, when they contested the 1991 Cup Winners' Cup final. The first meeting between the two sides came in the third round of the 1983–84 Cup Winners' Cup; Barcelona won the first leg at the Camp Nou 2–0, but Manchester United won the return leg 3–0 at Old Trafford to reach the semi-finals. That result marked Manchester United's biggest win over Barcelona; Barcelona's biggest win was a 4–0 home victory in the group stage of the 1994–95 Champions League. The most recent meeting between the teams came in the semi-finals of the 2007–08 Champions League, when United held Barcelona to a 0–0 draw at the Camp Nou before beating them 1–0 at Old Trafford. Despite their record against Manchester United, Barcelona had an overall winning record against English clubs, having won 20 and lost 15 of their 52 matches against English opposition. Manchester United, on the other hand, had a losing record against Spanish teams; they had lost 11 and won 10 of their 37 matches.\nBoth teams had won the UEFA Champions League before; Manchester United had three titles, while Barcelona had two. The most recent of these had come only the season before, when Manchester United beat Chelsea on penalties in the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. They won the first of their European Cups in 1968, beating Benfica 4–1 at Wembley Stadium, while their second was achieved in 1999 with a 2–1 win over Bayern Munich at Barcelona's home ground, the Camp Nou, in which they overturned a 1–0 Bayern lead with two goals in second-half injury time. Barcelona's first European Cup was won as recently as 1992, when they beat Sampdoria 1–0 after extra time at Wembley; their only other title came in 2006 with a 2–1 win over another English side, Arsenal. Prior to 2009, unlike Barcelona, Manchester United had never lost a European Cup final; Barcelona had lost three – in 1961, 1986 and 1994, to Benfica, Steaua București and A.C. Milan respectively.\nBoth teams went into the match as the champions of their respective countries – the first time that the final had been contested by domestic champions since 1999 – both winning with games to spare. Manchester United won their 11th Premier League title with a 0–0 draw at home to Arsenal on 16 May, while Barcelona were confirmed as La Liga champions for the first time in three years when Real Madrid lost to Villarreal on the same day. Both Manchester United and Barcelona were also looking for another Champions League title to cap a season in which they had won multiple trophies: Manchester United had already won four out of a possible seven trophies in 2008–09 and were playing for the possibility of becoming the third team to retain the European double (the domestic league and the European Cup) and win a treble along with the Football League Cup, while Barcelona were aiming to become the first Spanish club to win the continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League.\nRoad to Rome.\nBarcelona.\nBy virtue of their third-place finish in the 2007–08 La Liga, Barcelona entered the 2008–09 Champions League at the third qualifying round. Based on their UEFA coefficient, Barcelona were seeded for the third qualifying round draw, and drawn against Polish champions Wisła Kraków. A 4–0 win in the first leg at the Camp Nou made defeat in the second leg immaterial and Barcelona were entered into the group stage draw.\nBarcelona's UEFA coefficient placed them in the top eight seeds for the draw, meaning that they would avoid having to play against Inter Milan, Liverpool, Chelsea or holders and their semi-final opponents from 2007 to 2008, Manchester United. However, they could still draw Bayern Munich, Roma or Juventus. In the end, Barcelona were drawn into Group C against Sporting CP, Basel and Shakhtar Donetsk.\nFour wins and a draw at home to Basel placed Barcelona on top of their group with a game to spare, and despite defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk on Matchday 6, they still had the third-best record amongst the qualifiers for the first knockout round. As group winners, Barcelona would avoid being drawn with other group winners, including Manchester United, Liverpool, Juventus and Bayern Munich, but they could still be drawn against runners-up such as Chelsea, Inter and Arsenal. The draw eventually paired them with Lyon and, as group winners, they would play the second leg at home.\nIn the first leg in Lyon, Barcelona fell behind to a seventh-minute free kick from Juninho, only for Thierry Henry to equalise halfway through the second half, giving Barcelona an away goal to take back to the Camp Nou. They needed a win or a no-score draw to guarantee passage, but a 4–1 half-time lead set the stage for a convincing 5–2 win. Two first-half goals from Henry and one each from Lionel Messi and Samuel Eto'o were followed by goals from Jean Makoun and Juninho either side of the interval to reduce Lyon's deficit. However, a goal from Seydou Keita in the fifth minute of injury time secured a 6–3 aggregate win and passage to the next round.\nIn the quarter-finals, Barcelona were drawn against their fellow leading-scorers in the competition, Bayern Munich, who had beaten Barcelona's group stage opposition, Sporting CP, 12–1 on aggregate in the previous round. However, despite Bayern's impressive scoring record, goals from Messi and Eto'o gave Barcelona a 2–0 lead within the first 12 minutes. Messi and Henry also scored to seal a 4–0 home victory before half-time. The lack of an away goal meant Bayern Munich would have to win by five clear goals to qualify for the semi-finals. After a goalless first half, they took the lead through Franck Ribéry in the 47th minute, but it was not enough for Bayern as Keita equalised in the 73rd minute to clinch a 5–1 aggregate win for the Spanish side.\nThe quarter-final draw also determined the teams' routes to the final, with Barcelona facing the prospect of meeting either Chelsea or Liverpool in the semi-finals. After a 3–1 win at Anfield, Chelsea qualified for the semi-finals with a 4–4 draw at Stamford Bridge. The semi-final first leg was played at the Camp Nou; although Barcelona enjoyed the majority of the possession, Chelsea's defence was resolute and they became the first side to keep a clean sheet in Barcelona in this season's competition, coming away with a goalless draw. Barcelona needed to avoid defeat to reach the final, but they found themselves a goal down within 10 minutes; after they failed to clear Frank Lampard's pass into the penalty area, Michael Essien fired a left-footed volley past Víctor Valdés into the roof of the net. The rest of the match continued much the same as the first leg, with Barcelona retaining most of the possession. Despite this, they found themselves guilty of several fouls, while Chelsea made four unsuccessful penalty appeals during the match. Meanwhile, Dani Alves received his third yellow card of the knockout phase, ruling him out of Barcelona's next match, and Eric Abidal was given a straight red card for a foul on Nicolas Anelka as the French forward was through on goal. However, television replays after the incident showed that there was little contact between Abidal and Anelka. Norwegian referee Tom Henning Øvrebø allowed a minimum of four minutes of injury time at the end of the second half; in the third of those four minutes – just when it looked like Chelsea were about to secure a repeat of the 2008 final – Messi played the ball across the edge of the penalty area to Andrés Iniesta, who shot just past Petr Čech's outstretched hand for the away goal that would send Barcelona to the final.\nManchester United.\nAs the reigning champions of the UEFA Champions League, Manchester United began their title defence at the group stage, for which they were given the top seed. This position amongst the top eight European clubs meant that they would avoid drawing former European champions Barcelona, Inter and Real Madrid until at least the first knockout round, although they were faced with the prospect of drawing Bayern Munich or Roma. Nevertheless, United ended up being drawn into Group E with two teams they had played against before: Villarreal (whom they had drawn in 2005–06) and Celtic (2006–07); and one they had not: Aalborg BK.\nTwo victories – away to Aalborg and at home to Celtic – and four draws were enough to secure passage to the knockout phase of the competition. Following a Celtic victory over Villarreal in the final group match, United went through as group winners. This meant that they would avoid Roma, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Porto and Juventus in the first knockout round; however, their potential opposition still included Inter, Lyon and Real Madrid. The draw paired Manchester United with José Mourinho's Inter, but since United had won their group, they were rewarded by having the second leg at home.\nUnited started the first leg the better of the two sides, and although Inter improved in the second half, neither side was able to find the net during the match, and United took a 0–0 draw back to Old Trafford. The draw was also United's 20th match since their last defeat in the UEFA Champions League, breaking Ajax's 19-match record that had stood for 13 years. The lack of an away goal at the San Siro meant that United could not afford to concede a goal in the event of a draw. A fourth-minute headed goal from Nemanja Vidić, however, got the home side off to a good start, and Cristiano Ronaldo doubled United's lead four minutes into the second half. Shots from both Zlatan Ibrahimović and Adriano hit the frame of the Manchester United goal in either half of the match, but they were unable to find the back of the net, and the 2–0 result sent the English champions through to the next stage of the competition.\nThe draw for the quarter-finals paired United with Porto, against whom they had played in the first knockout round of the 2003–04 competition. The draw also determined the semi-final pairings, with United or Porto drawn to play against Arsenal or Villarreal. The first leg of the quarter-final was played at Old Trafford, giving Porto the chance to put the pressure on Manchester United with an away goal. That away goal came in the fourth minute of the game, but Wayne Rooney equalised 10 minutes later and Carlos Tevez gave United the lead in the 85th minute. However, with only one minute left in the game, United suffered a defensive lapse, allowing Mariano González to score Porto's second away goal. Those away goals meant that United travelled to the Estádio do Dragão in Porto needing a win or a score-draw of 2–2 or higher to remain in the competition. A 40-yard goal from Ronaldo in the sixth minute put United into the lead, and although both sides pressed for another goal, it proved to be the only one of the game, making Manchester United the first English side to win in Porto.\nMeanwhile, a 1–1 draw in Villarreal and a 3–0 win at the Emirates Stadium secured Arsenal's status as United's semi-final opponents. The draw had determined that United would play the first leg at home, and after Rooney, Tevez and Ronaldo had early chances, John O'Shea opened the scoring, firing home a Michael Carrick cross after Arsenal had failed to clear a corner. United continued to make chances throughout the game, but despite Arsenal making a couple of chances themselves, the match finished at 1–0 and United travelled to the Emirates Stadium a week later needing only to avoid defeat to become the first defending champions to reach the final since Juventus in 1997. Although Arsenal only needed to overturn a one-goal deficit, their chances of victory were drastically reduced within the first 11 minutes of the match; Park Ji-sung took advantage of a slip by Kieran Gibbs to double United's aggregate lead in the eighth minute, before Ronaldo fired home a 41-yard free kick in the 11th minute. With two away goals on the United scoreboard, Arsenal now had to score four goals to reach the final. However, it was United who scored the next goal, as they hit Arsenal on the break and Ronaldo scored within 15 seconds of Arsenal losing the ball at the other end of the pitch. 15 minutes from time, Arsenal were awarded a penalty kick after Darren Fletcher brought Cesc Fàbregas down in the penalty area, a foul for which Fletcher was sent off – although replays showed that Fletcher knocked the ball away from Fàbregas immediately before bringing him down, resulting in some controversy as to whether Fletcher deserved a red card for the foul. Robin van Persie scored the penalty to make the score 3–1, but it was not enough to prevent United from reaching the final unbeaten for the fourth time in their history.\nPre-match.\nVenue.\nThe Stadio Olimpico in Rome was selected as the venue for the 2009 UEFA Champions League final at a meeting of the UEFA Executive Committee in Ljubljana, Slovenia, on 4 October 2006. The committee – who decided the venue for the 2008 final and the 2008 and 2009 UEFA Cup finals at the same meeting – based their decision on a number of factors, including stadium capacity, safety and security facilities, and accessibility.\nThe Stadio Olimpico had hosted three European Cup finals before 2009: the 1977 and 1984 finals, both of which were won by Liverpool – Liverpool beat Borussia Mönchengladbach 3–1 in 1977 before beating home side Roma 4–2 on penalties after the match finished 1–1 after extra time; the most recent final to be held at the Stadio Olimpico was the 1996 final, which Juventus also won 4–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw with Ajax.\nThe construction of the stadium was commissioned by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini in the mid-1930s as the centrepiece of a new sports complex in the city, to be named \"Foro Mussolini\". After World War II, the complex was renamed \"Foro Italico\" and the stadium was radically redesigned as a 54,000-capacity arena for the 1960 Summer Olympics. After hosting the 1987 World Athletics Championships, the stadium was redeveloped in time for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, at which West Germany's 1–0 win over Argentina in the final was played there. The stadium's most recent renovation, in 2008, brought the capacity to 72,689.\nSince 1999, the UEFA Champions League final has been given a unique visual identity in order to increase the marketing appeal of the event. Designed by London-based design and branding agency Radiant, the theme for the 2009 final was revealed on 25 October 2008, and it incorporated several typically Roman images; the logo was centred around an outline of the European Champion Clubs' Cup, upon which was written \"MMIX\" – \"2009\" in Roman numerals; around the base of the trophy was a stylised laurel wreath, and in the background was a simplified image of the interior of the Colosseum. An alternative logo consisting of the UEFA Champions League logo surrounded by a laurel wreath was also released. The entire theme was based on a colour scheme of deep red and silver-white.\nA trophy handover ceremony was held in Rome on 21 April 2009, at which Ole Gunnar Solskjær, representing Manchester United as the previous season's champions, returned the trophy to UEFA president Michel Platini. Platini then presented the trophy to Gianni Alemanno, the Mayor of Rome, that it might be put on display in and around the city until the day of the final. Also present at the ceremony were the president and vice-president of the Italian Football Federation, Giancarlo Abete and Demetrio Albertini, the ambassador for the final, Bruno Conti, and Emilio Di Toro on behalf of the Italian National Olympic Committee.\nTicketing.\nAlthough the usual capacity of the Stadio Olimpico is over 72,000, this was reduced to approximately 67,000 for the 2009 UEFA Champions League final. Approximately 10,000 tickets were made available to the general public, with recipients determined by a random ballot following an application period that ran from 2 to 16 March 2009. Each club was also allocated approximately 20,000 tickets for distribution to fans. Manchester United chose to limit ticket applications to season ticket holders, with preference given to those who had attended more of the club's Champions League away fixtures that season. Barcelona, meanwhile, allotted 80% of their ticket allocation to fans, with the remaining 20% going to the club's corporate sponsors. Unlike United, however, Barcelona opened ticket applications to all 150,000 of their members. The remaining 17,000 tickets were retained by UEFA for the \"European football family\", which comprises UEFA itself, the local organising committee, UEFA's member associations and its commercial partners.\nTickets for the 2009 final were similar to ATM cards, with an integrated chip storing the ticket holder's personal information in order to ensure that the ticket is being presented by its legitimate owner. As further security, tickets also had to be presented with an adequate form of photographic identification. However, despite these security measures, counterfeit tickets were still produced, forcing UEFA to issue a statement warning people against buying tickets from touts.\nDespite only receiving 20,000 tickets for fans, it was expected that around 30,000 Manchester United fans would be travelling to Rome for the final, leading to police warning ticketless fans not to travel amidst fears of potential hooligans making the trip. Fans were also warned to avoid certain areas of the city that are known to be frequented by members of Rome's Ultra fan groups. Despite Rome's reputation as a hotbed for knife-related crime, dubbed \"Stab City\" by some, UEFA was confident that the 2009 final would pass without incident, but on the morning of the final, there were reports that a Manchester United fan had been stabbed in the leg the previous evening. It was also expected that a similar number of Barcelona fans would be arriving in Rome in the lead-up to the match. After the match, UEFA president Michel Platini praised the Rome police for their arrangement of security for the final.\nMore than 3,000 Manchester United fans congregated just outside the city in a field that came to be known as \"Fergie's Field\". The venue provided ticketless fans with the opportunity to watch the match on a giant screen, and kept them away from the streets of Rome's city centre, although the alcohol ban that came into effect in the city at 17:00 (Central European Summer Time) on 26 May was still in force.\nMatch ball.\nThe official match ball for the 2009 Champions League final was the \"adidas Finale Rome\". Based on the \"Starball\" design that has been used for the Champions League final since 2001 and become synonymous with the UEFA Champions League, the \"Finale Rome\" was unveiled on 16 March 2009. The colour scheme was a traditional Roman burgundy with a gold border around the stars. The ball used the same panel configuration as the Adidas Europass and the Adidas Teamgeist before it, and the same thermal bonding process was used to adhere the panels to each other, while the surface of the ball featured the same \"PSC-Texture\" as was debuted with the Europass; the surface of the ball was covered with thousands of tiny pimples, which was designed to improve the grip between boot and ball.\nOfficials.\nThe referee for the 2009 UEFA Champions League final was Massimo Busacca, representing the Swiss Football Association. Having been on FIFA's list of internationally accredited referees since 1999, Busacca had experience of officiating 32 UEFA Champions League matches, six of them during the 2008–09 season, and most recently the second leg of Manchester United's quarter-final against Porto on 15 April 2009. He also took charge of the first leg of the semi-final between Manchester United and Barcelona in the 2007–08 competition. Busacca also refereed at both the 2006 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2008, and took charge of the 2007 UEFA Cup Final between Espanyol and Sevilla at Hampden Park, Glasgow, on 16 May 2007.\nAs usual, the referee was supported by assistant referees and a fourth official from the same country; in the 2009 final, Massimo Busacca was assisted by Matthias Arnet and Francesco Buragina, with Claudio Circhetta as the fourth official.\nKits.\nHaving been designated as the official \"home\" team, Barcelona were given the first choice of kits for the final and opted to wear their traditional red and blue shirts in a halved design. Since the Barcelona home kit clashed with both Manchester United's home and European away kits, the Red Devils wore their white domestic away kit for the first time in a European Cup final. They wore blue for their first European Cup final against Benfica in 1968, but wore red for both of their most recent finals in 1999 and 2008. Manchester United had previously worn white against Barcelona in five matches, losing just one of them – a 2–0 defeat in 1984 – while the only win in white came in the 1991 Cup Winners' Cup Final. The other three matches finished in draws: two 3–3 and one 0–0. Barcelona, on the other hand, had won two of their five European Cup finals – they wore orange for their win over Sampdoria in 1992 but wore their usual blue and red stripes for their most recent win in 2006 against Arsenal. However, two of their European Cup final defeats came against teams wearing white – against Steaua București in 1986 and against A.C. Milan in 1994.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe 2009 UEFA Champions League final officially opened with the opening of the UEFA Champions Festival at Rome's \"Arco di Costantino\" and the \"Parco di Colle Oppio\" above the Colosseum. The Champions Festival was opened by former Italy international goalkeeper Luca Marchegiani on 23 May 2009 and ran until the afternoon on the day of the final, culminating with a football match between a European side coached by former Netherlands international Ruud Gullit and an all-Italian team featuring Milan one-club man Alessandro Costacurta and final ambassador Bruno Conti. Other attractions at the Champions Festival included appearances by representatives from both clubs (Bryan Robson and Ole Gunnar Solskjær for Manchester United and Hristo Stoichkov for Barcelona), exhibitions featuring memorabilia from past UEFA Champions League tournaments and the European Champion Clubs' Cup on display.\nImmediately prior to the match itself came the opening ceremony for the final. The ceremony began with 64 members of the Rustavi Ensemble dance group performing a choreographed routine to a variation of the UEFA Champions League Anthem. At the culmination of the routine, the players emerged from the tunnel, accompanied by Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli singing \"Il Gladiatore\" – a song based on \"Earth\" from the soundtrack to the film \"Gladiator\" – before Bocelli sang supporting vocals to the UEFA Champions League Anthem. Before they emerged from their dressing room, manager Pep Guardiola played the Barcelona team a specially commissioned seven-minute film showing their best moments from the season interspersed with clips from the film \"Gladiator\". The film culminated with the late Luciano Pavarotti's version of \"Nessun Dorma\", and it left several of the players in tears. With his players motivated for the game, Guardiola said nothing as they emerged into the tunnel.\nMatch.\nTeam selection.\nTwo Barcelona players missed the final through suspension: right-back Dani Alves, who picked up his third yellow card of the tournament in Barcelona's semi-final second leg against Chelsea on 6 May 2009; and left-back Eric Abidal, who was sent off in the same game for a professional foul on Nicolas Anelka. Defender Rafael Márquez also missed the match after he picked up a knee injury in the first leg of the semi-final, ruling him out for the rest of the season. Forward Thierry Henry and semi-final-winning midfielder Andrés Iniesta were also doubts for the final; Henry damaged his right posterior cruciate ligament in Barcelona's 6–2 league win over Real Madrid on 2 May 2009, while Iniesta was discovered to have suffered a tear in his right thigh following Barça's 3–3 draw with Villarreal on 10 May. Both Henry and Iniesta returned to light training on 22 May, but they had not yet resumed training with the main squad and remained doubts for the final. Carles Puyol, however, was available for selection after he served a one-match suspension in the semi-final second leg.\nManchester United's starting right-winger from the 2008 final, Owen Hargreaves, missed the match as he was still in rehabilitation after a double knee operation to cure his tendinitis problems that had seen him play little part in the 2008–09 Champions League campaign. It had been expected that defender Wes Brown would also miss the match after suffering a recurrence of a foot injury, but he returned to training quicker than expected and was involved in United's match against Hull City on 24 May, although he picked up a slight knock during the game. Rio Ferdinand was also a doubt following a calf injury that has kept him out of the United side since the semi-final second leg against Arsenal; Alex Ferguson had said that Ferdinand might not start in Rome if he was not fit to play against Hull, but he later admitted that Ferdinand was on course to recover in time to play in the match. Second-choice goalkeeper Ben Foster also missed the match after requiring surgery to repair a ruptured ligament in his right thumb in May 2009. On the other hand, following John O'Shea's winning goal in Manchester United's semi-final first leg victory over Arsenal, United manager Alex Ferguson suggested that the Irish utility player would be guaranteed a place in the starting line-up were United to reach the final. O'Shea's place in the team was confirmed at Manchester United's media day the week before the final. South Korean midfielder Park Ji-sung was also promised a place in the team after he missed the 2008 final, finally making him the first Asian to appear in a European Cup final. Cristiano Ronaldo suffered a slight injury scare in training the night before the final, requiring a bandage on his lower right leg, but he was eventually fit enough to play in the match.\nMeanwhile, midfielder Darren Fletcher was forced to miss the final after picking up a red card in the second leg of the semi-final. While replays showed that Fletcher played the ball before felling Cesc Fàbregas in the penalty area, the UEFA appeals process only allows for cards to be rescinded in the case of mistaken identity. Despite this, an appeal was submitted by Manchester United on \"compassionate\" grounds. Barcelona decided to appeal against the suspensions of Abidal and Alves after United lodged an appeal against Fletcher's red card. Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola came out in support of overturning all three players' suspensions. The appeals were declared unsuccessful on 11 May, with UEFA saying in a statement that the appeals were not submitted within the required 24-hour deadline of the matches and that even if they had been submitted on time then \"they would have been rejected as unfounded as there were no grounds for contesting the referees' original decisions.\" By upholding the suspensions, UEFA made Abidal, Alves and Fletcher the first players to miss a Champions League final through suspension since Juventus' Pavel Nedvěd sat out the 2003 final at Old Trafford.\nSummary.\nFirst half.\nBarcelona kicked the match off, but Manchester United showed their intent from the outset, forcing goalkeeper Víctor Valdés to concede a throw-in after just 10 seconds. Further pressure on the attack resulted in Yaya Touré fouling Anderson within Cristiano Ronaldo's shooting range. Ronaldo fired the free kick directly at Valdés, but the Spanish goalkeeper could only parry the ball and Gerard Piqué did well to divert Park Ji-sung's follow-up effort over the bar. The resulting corner was cleared, but only as far as Wayne Rooney, whose snap-shot was wayward and went out for a goal kick.\nBoth teams struggled to put a flowing move together in the opening exchanges, but it was United who had the better chances, both falling to Ronaldo. The first came in the seventh minute: having been played the ball by Michael Carrick, Ronaldo turned away from Piqué on the edge of the centre circle, before hitting a shot just wide from almost 40 yards; the second saw the ball break to Ronaldo after Anderson and Patrice Evra had linked up well down the left flank. The Portuguese winger controlled the ball on the chest before hitting the ball just past the far post.\nDespite United's early pressure, it was Barcelona who scored the first goal of the match. Edwin van der Sar cleared the ball downfield for Manchester United, but it was headed away by Barcelona's midfield anchor Sergio Busquets. Carrick was first to the ball for Manchester United, but he could only head it as far as Xavi, who passed to Andrés Iniesta. The Manchester United defence backed away from the Spaniard, who – after exchanging passes with Lionel Messi – played the ball into the path of Samuel Eto'o in the Manchester United penalty area. Nemanja Vidić attempted to shepherd the Cameroonian striker towards the goal line, but Eto'o easily stepped inside him and toe-poked the ball past Van der Sar to make it 1–0 to Barcelona inside 10 minutes.\nThe goal shifted the balance of the game in Barcelona's favour, as United had been on top in terms of shots and possession up to that point. Almost immediately after the restart, Vidić gave away an unnecessary corner. In a rehearsed corner move, Xavi played the ball back to the edge of the penalty area towards Messi, but the tournament's top scorer was unable to make a proper connection. Nevertheless, Barça retained possession through some sharp inter-passing involving Xavi and Iniesta. When United did manage to regain the ball, however, it was quickly given away by a poor pass from Carrick, while Anderson mis-timed a kick and completely missed the ball. It was now Barcelona's turn to pressurise the United players, forcing them into backward passes or long, hopeful balls forward.\nThe quality of the teams' passing remained the main difference between them; however, in the 16th minute, Barcelona lost the ball and Ryan Giggs sent a long ball forward to Ronaldo. Ronaldo's first touch took him inside Piqué before going back outside the former Manchester United defender, who cynically blocked Ronaldo's run, earning himself the first yellow card of the match. Ronaldo shaped to take the free kick himself, but it was Giggs who shot for goal, only to curl the ball just over the bar.\nBarcelona responded quickly, as Carles Puyol found Eto'o with a long throw-in down the right wing. The Cameroonian then found Messi, who cut inside and hit a curling 35-yard shot that just shaved the top of the crossbar. A quick-passing move from United followed, culminating with a through-ball to Park in the inside right channel, only for Valdés to cut out the pass, taking out the South Korean in the process. The resulting throw-in eventually broke to Ronaldo, whose 30-yard shot went just wide. Valdés' clash with Park, however, left him requiring treatment, and although the injury was not sufficient to necessitate a substitution, Valdés chose to leave his next few goal kicks to Piqué.\nIn the 22nd minute, a lofted through-pass from Carrick found Rooney on the left wing, but the Liverpudlian's cross was blocked by Touré and went out for a corner kick. The corner, taken by Giggs, found Ronaldo, but the Portuguese got too far under the ball and headed over. Precise passing from the Barcelona midfield got the Catalans moving upfield until a shoulder charge from Anderson sent Iniesta stumbling to the ground in the inside-left channel 30 yards from goal. The consequent free kick was taken by Xavi, who sent the ball just wide of the near post. Another free kick followed, as Messi was bundled over by a double-challenge from Vidić and Carrick, but it came to nothing.\nWith ten minutes left until half-time, the Manchester United defence effectively switched off and allowed Touré to dribble unopposed to within 15 yards of their penalty area before slipping the ball out wide to Puyol, whose low cross was diverted behind by Vidić. The corner kick was taken short and the eventual cross was headed behind for another corner on the opposite side by Evra. The second corner was crossed in towards Piqué, but he was unable to make contact with the ball.\nWith half-time fast approaching, Barcelona's confidence began to show: first, Messi attempted to flick a pass over the top of the United defence to Thierry Henry, which Rio Ferdinand intercepted; Iniesta then tried an ambitious back-heel that Van der Sar collected; and finally Messi sped through three Manchester United defenders towards the by-line, only for his cut-back cross to be pounced upon by Van der Sar and then cleared by Vidić. On the stroke of half-time, Iniesta himself then attempted to flick the ball through to Henry, but it was just too high for the French striker, and referee Massimo Busacca took that cue to blow the whistle for the interval.\nSecond half.\nAfter bringing on Carlos Tevez in place of Anderson at half time, Manchester United kicked off the second half in a different formation, with Tevez joining Ronaldo up front in a familiar 4–4–2. Both teams attempted to settle into their customary passing rhythms, but – unlike the first half – it was Barcelona who settled first; Manchester United's passes in their attacking third of the field failed to find their targets, and Iniesta eventually came away with the ball before flicking a pass through to Xavi, who played a through-ball to Henry on the left wing. The French forward turned Ferdinand inside-out, but his shot from a narrow angle was straight at Van der Sar and ended up going out for a throw-in. Xavi then again passed the ball out to the left flank, where Henry nonchalantly left it for the on-rushing Sylvinho; the Brazilian full-back whipped in a cross for Eto'o, but it was caught on the edge of the six-yard box by Van der Sar.\nPressure high up the pitch from Barcelona kept Manchester United in their own half, forcing them into attempting long balls downfield. A scrappy few moments in and around the centre circle followed, but Manchester United eventually came away with the ball. However, a lapse in communication between Giggs and Evra on the left wing allowed Eto'o to steal in and advance on the Manchester United goal. He cut in from the right wing and played a through-ball just out of reach of Messi, who went to ground after O'Shea had put his hand on Messi's shoulder. A period of sustained pressure from Barcelona followed, culminating with a run from Iniesta, who could only be stopped by a foul from Tevez on the edge of the Manchester United penalty area. The consequent free kick was taken by Xavi, who curled the ball around the defensive wall and onto the post with Van der Sar beaten.\nUnited responded with their first extended period of possession of the half, working the ball into wide areas to be crossed into the middle, but Rooney's first couple of attempted centres were well cleared by Piqué. At the third attempt, though, Rooney's cross evaded the Barcelona defence as Touré kicked at thin air; however, it also failed to find a Manchester United player in the penalty area, both Ronaldo and Park going close. After Ronaldo was called offside in the 59th minute – despite appearing to be level with the last defender – Giggs stole the ball mid-way inside the Barcelona half before playing the ball to Ronaldo on the left wing. The Portuguese forward stepped over the ball several times in an attempt to wrong-foot Puyol, before cutting inside and playing the ball across the edge of the area towards Carrick. A sliding challenge from Busquets prevented a shot, only for the English midfielder to slide the ball out for a Barcelona goal kick while attempting to play Rooney through. Rooney was again played down the right wing a few moments later, but his low cross was diverted behind by Piqué, and the resulting corner came to nothing. A left-wing attack from Ronaldo followed, but after cutting inside, he gave the ball away cheaply. Barcelona immediately went on the attack down the other end, but Henry was unable to get past O'Shea and his shot was well saved by Van der Sar low at the near post.\nIn the 66th minute, Alex Ferguson completed his attacking quartet by bringing Dimitar Berbatov on in place of Park. Ronaldo was penalised for a high elbow when challenging for a header with Puyol a minute later, before Rooney forced another corner off Piqué in the 69th minute. However, United's numbers up front in search of another goal left them wanting in defence; a weak clearance from Van der Sar was cut out by Puyol who played the ball to Eto'o on the right side of the penalty area. The ball broke to Xavi on the edge of the area, who crossed for Messi to send a looping header over the United goalkeeper and into the far side of the goal for a two-goal lead. Immediately after the goal, Henry was replaced by Seydou Keita, allowing Barcelona to adopt a more defensive stance.\nUnited responded to the goal immediately, as Giggs made a surging run through the Barcelona defence before playing the ball to Berbatov in the inside-right channel. The Bulgarian forward's low cross found Giggs in the centre, and the United captain's shot was deflected to Ronaldo on the far side of the goal, only for the Portuguese's shot to be blocked by Valdés. The resulting corner reached Berbatov on the far side of the goal, but it was deemed to have crossed the goal line first and Barcelona were awarded a goal kick, from which they launched another attack. Messi played a through-ball to Puyol on the right flank, but as the Barcelona captain reached the goal line, he was fouled by Ronaldo, who – despite going in two-footed – escaped the referee's book. Puyol himself rose to head Xavi's free kick towards goal, but it was directly at Van der Sar, who claimed the ball easily.\nManchester United used their third and final substitute in the 75th minute, replacing Giggs with Paul Scholes, who took over as team captain. Ronaldo and Scholes each received yellow cards in the 78th and 80th minutes, respectively; Ronaldo's yellow card was awarded for a robust shoulder-charge on Puyol as the Barcelona right back shepherded the ball out for a goal kick, while Scholes was booked for a late challenge on Busquets. While the referee played advantage after Scholes' foul, Iniesta cut inside from the left wing and hit a shot that was saved above the head of Van der Sar. An extended spell of Barcelona possession followed, as they strung a series of around 20 passes together, culminating with Puyol attempting to clip the ball over the onrushing Van der Sar, who blocked the shot. Both players went for the follow-up, but the Dutch goalkeeper was first to the ball and sent Puyol sprawling.\nIn the 85th minute, Scholes clipped the ball over the top of the Barcelona defensive line to Rooney, who chested the ball down for Tevez, only to be given offside. Scholes then found Rooney again on the left wing with a raking ball from deep inside his own half, but Rooney's first touch was heavy, allowing Puyol to get back and put the ball out for a corner. Rooney took the corner short to Tevez, whose cross was just beyond the reach of Berbatov and diverted behind again by Puyol. Rooney also took the second corner, which was met by Berbatov, but he put the ball high over the crossbar.\nAs the match entered its closing stages, the referee allotted a minimum of three minutes of injury time. The first of these saw Van der Sar make a poor pass after the ball was played back to him by Ferdinand, allowing Iniesta to steal in and play the ball towards Messi in the United penalty area, only for Vidić to get there ahead of the Argentine and knock the ball out for a corner. Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola brought Pedro on for Iniesta in the second minute of added time, before Vidić was immediately shown a yellow card for a clash of heads with Messi when going for a header. That was to be the final act of the match, as referee Massimo Busacca blew for full-time as soon as Xavi took the free kick.\nTrophy presentation.\nAt the final whistle, Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola offered his commiserations to each of Manchester United's players, while former Manchester United defender Gerard Piqué talked with his erstwhile teammates. Both teams then retreated to either end of the stadium to applaud their fans.\nWhile match referee Massimo Busacca and his assistants collected their mementoes of the final, the Barcelona team formed a guard of honour for the Manchester United players, just as the English side had done for Chelsea in 2008. Led by their manager, Alex Ferguson, and team captain, Ryan Giggs, the Manchester United team then ascended the specially constructed rostrum to collect their runners-up medals from UEFA president Michel Platini and secretary David Taylor. Other dignitaries present included Manchester United chief executive David Gill; The Football Association's president Prince William, and chairman Lord Triesman; Barcelona president Joan Laporta; Juan Carlos I of Spain; Royal Spanish Football Federation president Ángel María Villar; and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Ferguson also collected a commemorative plaque from Platini, but immediately handed it to Giggs.\nAfter offering his commiserations to Manchester United's players, Joan Laporta then joined the Barcelona team to lead them up the podium, closely followed by manager Guardiola. Laporta himself collected Barcelona's commemorative plaque before accepting a medal from Platini. Once the entire Barcelona team had collected their medals, Platini made his way to the front of the podium to present Carles Puyol with the European Champion Clubs' Cup. The Barcelona captain promptly held the trophy aloft with accompaniment from the UEFA Champions League Anthem and explosions of golden confetti, before leading his team on a lap of honour.\nDetails.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nReaction.\nDuring the match, \"UEFA.com\" users were able to vote for their man of the match; the public vote went to the scorer of Barcelona's second goal, Lionel Messi. The UEFA Technical Study Group, however, chose the man who provided the cross for Messi's goal, Xavi, as their man of the match, citing his control of the tempo of the match as the reason for their decision. Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola took the time to give special praise to Messi, whom he said he moved back into the midfield in order to increase the team's effectiveness when in possession of the ball. Messi had been withdrawn from his usual right-wing role into a more central position, while Samuel Eto'o, who had started the match as Barcelona's lone centre-forward, was moved out to the right. Guardiola also lauded the bravery of his entire team, stating that he believed that his team's victory hinged on their hard work and propensity for taking risks in attack, but he admitted that although his side had had the best season in the history of the club, they were not yet the best Barcelona team.\nIn the Manchester United camp, manager Alex Ferguson admitted that his team had been beaten by the better side and that the game was all but lost after the first goal. United forward Cristiano Ronaldo, however, criticised his team's tactics, saying that \"everything went wrong\". Ferguson paid tribute to Messi and the midfield partnership of Xavi and Iniesta, while Wayne Rooney lauded Iniesta as \"the best player in the world\". Ferguson also expressed his regret at the unavailability of midfielder Darren Fletcher, who was suspended for the match, and lamented at his side's \"shoddy\" defending and ineffectiveness when in possession. Nevertheless, Ferguson paid tribute to Guardiola's achievement of winning the treble in his first season of management. Barcelona's victory also made Guardiola only the sixth man to win the competition as both a player and a manager, following in the footsteps of Miguel Muñoz, Giovanni Trapattoni, Johan Cruyff, Carlo Ancelotti and, most recently, Frank Rijkaard, who also won the Champions League as Barcelona manager.\nThe match turned out to be the last for Carlos Tevez as a Manchester United player, as he chose not to make his loan spell with the club permanent and joined their local rivals, Manchester City. After announcing his intention to leave Manchester United, Tevez criticised Ferguson's team selection for the 2009 Champions League final, saying that Ferguson should have included him in the starting line-up, with the rationale that the match was the only final that Manchester United had lost in his time at the club.\nThe match was also Ronaldo's last game at Manchester United for over twelve years, as he completed a world record £80 million transfer to Real Madrid on 1 July. He would later go on to rejoin United in August 2021, and departing once more in November 2022.\nTelevision audiences for the final reached more than 10 million in both Spain and the United Kingdom. 11.3 million people watched the match on Spain's Antena 3 network – the largest viewing figures for that station in the past year – while another 600,000 watched on Canal+ Spain. In the United Kingdom, however, although the match received the highest ratings of any programme that evening, viewing figures were down by 1.5 million on the previous year's final, with just 9.6 million watching on ITV1, although an additional 1.79 million watched on Sky Sports 1. Despite there being no Italian or French representative in the final, the figures were much the same in those two countries as they were in Spain and the United Kingdom, with Italy's Rai Uno garnering an average viewership of 9.63 million and France's TF1 receiving 8.25 million. Only 6.55 million people watched the match on Germany's Sat.1 channel. According to a survey, global viewing figures for the match averaged 109 million; this put the UEFA Champions League final above the Super Bowl (106 million viewers in 2009) as the most-watched annual sporting event in the world. Total figures, which included viewers who watched only part of the match, put the Champions League final even further ahead of the Super Bowl, with 206 million viewers compared to 162 million.\nIn the United Kingdom, bookmakers made a profit from bets on a Manchester United victory. William Hill reported two bets of around £20,000 placed on Manchester United, while Paddy Power received one of £5,500 and Ladbrokes one of £3,000. Ladbrokes also took a bet of £10,000 on a Barcelona win, but bookmakers reported that most of the money was put on Manchester United. Extrabet.com paid out £12,000 to a £3,000 bet on Samuel Eto'o to score the first goal at odds of 4–1.\nRewards.\nBoth teams received significant financial rewards; for winning the final, Barcelona won €7 million in prize money, and Manchester United received €4 million as runners-up. Despite losing the match, Manchester United earned the most money overall from their 2008–09 Champions League campaign, receiving €38.281 million compared to Barcelona's €30.968 million, due to their share of the market pool, based on the value of the television market in their home countries.\nAs winners of the UEFA Champions League, Barcelona competed in the 2009 UEFA Super Cup, in which they beat 2008–09 UEFA Cup winners Shakhtar Donetsk 1–0 at Stade Louis II in Monaco on 28 August 2009, and in the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup in Abu Dhabi, where they beat Estudiantes of Argentina in the final.\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

        "text": "The 1988 Major League Baseball season ended with the underdog Los Angeles Dodgers shocking the Oakland Athletics, who had won 104 games during the regular season, in the World Series. The most memorable moment of the series came in Game 1, when injured Dodger Kirk Gibson hit a dramatic pinch-hit walk-off home run off Athletics closer Dennis Eckersley to win the game for Los Angeles. The Dodgers went on to win the Series in five games.\nThis would also be the final full season for Peter Ueberroth as MLB commissioner.\nOverview.\nOne of the American League's best players in 1988 was Athletics outfielder José Canseco, who became the first player in history to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in a single season, unanimously garnering league MVP honors. The A's surrounded him with a stellar supporting cast, led by fellow slugger Mark McGwire (with whom Canseco formed the famed \"Bash Brothers\" duo). Aided by strong pitching from Dave Stewart and Bob Welch and the lights-out Eckersley securing 45 saves, Oakland ran away with the American League West and swept the Boston Red Sox of Boggs, Rice, and Clemens in the playoffs before falling to the Dodgers in the World Series.\nSpeaking of the Dodgers, nobody expected them even to contend for the National League West title in 1988, let alone win the World Championship. However, the intensity and clutch hitting of Gibson (named the NL MVP at season's end) and the solid pitching of Orel Hershiser (who won a league-leading 23 games) spearheaded L.A. to a division championship by seven games over the Cincinnati Reds. In addition to his 23 victories, Hershiser led the National League with 267 innings pitched and 8 shutouts, and also set a record of 59 consecutive scoreless innings (formerly held by Dodger great Don Drysdale). These accomplishments, combined with his 2.26 ERA, earned him the National League Cy Young Award. However, it was in the postseason that Hershiser really distinguished himself – he started Games 1 and 3 of the NLCS against the tough New York Mets, saved Game 4 in relief, and threw a complete-game shutout in Game 7. He hurled another complete-game shutout in Game 2 of the World Series, and also helped his own cause going 3-3 at the plate with a run scored and an RBI, and again went the distance in the clinching Game 5. Hershiser was named MVP of both the NLCS and the World Series, capping off arguably one of the greatest seasons a starting pitcher has ever had.\nPostseason.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket/&gt;\n&lt;section end=Bracket/&gt;"

        "text": "Donald Frederick White (born 16 January 1926 in Earls Barton, England, died 21 April 2007) was an English rugby union footballer and coach. He was England's first national coach from 1969 until 1971, finishing with a record of three wins and a draw from 11 matches.\nHe was educated at Wellingborough Grammar School and at the age of 17 made his debut for Northampton, playing at prop. He made his Test debut for England in 1947 against Wales as flanker. He played 13 more matches for England, his last in 1953.\nWhite became Northampton's captain in 1954 and continued in the role until he retired from rugby in 1961 at the age of 35. He had represented his club 448 times.\nIn 1964 he became managing director and chairman of his family's shoe business, which received a Queen's award for export achievement in 1990.\nPlaying career.\nWhite made his first-class debut when he played for Northampton against Coventry in 1943. He was only 17 at the time and attending Wellingborough Grammar School. He had been recommended to the Northampton team by his history teacher. White said of his debut - where he played at prop - \"I thought I'd get a fearful hiding, but I emerged unscathed.\" White continued to play for Northampton, and eventually switched from playing prop to flanker.\nIn 1945 White made his first appearance against a touring side when Northampton played New Zealand Services; Northampton lost 11–6. In 1947 he was selected to make his international debut for England against Wales. He collected a cross-field kick to score a try to help England win 9–3. He played for England until 1953, and made a total of 14 appearances.\nHe also played for a Leicestershire and Midlands Combined XV that played Australia in 1947. He also led Midlands against South Africa in 1951. He led East Midlands annually against the Barbarians, and also won the counties championship with them in 1951. He also led East Midlands to the county championship final defeats in 1950 and 1953. He again played the Australians in 1957, this time leading a Leicestershire/East Midlands side to an 18–3 defeat. His most famous counties match was when he scored Leicestershire and East Midlands' only try in a 3–3 draw with the 1960 Springboks (South Africa).\nHe continued to play for Northampton until his retirement in 1961, and took over as captain from 1954, and when retired had represented the club 448 times. He had scored 116 tries, 71 penalties, 183 conversions and a drop goal - totaling 930 points. He was inducted into the Northampton Saints' Hall of Fame in 2005.\nCoach and administrator.\nWhite was appointed as England's first-ever coach in 1969. According to former Northampton player Bob Taylor, \"Don was chosen because he was the most forward-thinking coach in England\". His first match in charge was an 11–8 victory over South Africa at Twickenham in 1969. Of the eleven games England played with White in charge they won three, and drew one and lost seven. He resigned as England coach in 1971, and joined Northampton's committee. He was appointed the club's honorary president for their centenary season of 1979/1980. He continued to serve on the club's committee until he was ousted in 1988.\nPersonal and professional life.\nAfter finishing his schooling at Wellingborough Grammar School, White started working for his family's shoe business White &amp; Co in Earls Barton. He continued working at the family business and in 1964 was appointed as its managing director and chairman. In 1990 he received the Queen's award for export achievement. He continued as the managing director and chairman until his retirement in 1996.\nWhite was also the well respected President of Northampton Old Scouts RFC up until his death. Each April the club plays an over 30's v Under 30's game on a Saturday called the Don White Memorial Game, which is a well attended event. The Junior Sections play a large tournament again in Don White's name on the Sunday.\nHe was married to wife Barbara and had four children - Ian, Jill, Nick, and Sally - and nine grandchildren. He died at Earls Barton after illness, on 21 April 2007. His funeral on 4 May 2007 was attended by hundreds of mourners, including Northampton's club chairman Keith Barwell. There were so many mourners that it was necessary to set up more chairs outside the church. At the funeral, his daughter Jill said \"He achieved more than most of us could in 10 lifetimes.\""

James represented Wales and spent most of his career with Cardiff Blues\nClub career.\nAfter turning to rugby from athletics, he joined Merthyr RFC on the wing. After a successful year at Merthyr James joined Cardiff RFC at the start of the 2006–07 season. James scored 11 tries in just nine games to open the season which brought him to the attention of the first fifteen, with whom he had an academy contract. He was immediately put into the 22 man squad for the Cardiff Blues trip to Edinburgh in the Celtic League. He came off the bench midway through the second half and within minutes had marked his professional debut with a try.\nA slight knock kept him out of the first few games of the 2007–08 season. He came back shortly after the start, firstly playing a game for Cardiff RFC before starting the Blues away game against Munster in which he scored two tries. The following week he started again at home against Connacht and scored two more tries late on helping the Blues to a bonus point win.\nJames was top try scorer in the Magners League in the 2007–08 season.\nJames missed the first nine weeks of this season due to a groin injury. He scored a try in the final of the EDF Energy Cup at Twickenham on 18 April 2009 against Gloucester. He also scored the try that lead Cardiff to draw 26–26 in the Heineken Cup Semi-Final.\nOn 24 January 2013 it was announced that James had signed for Exeter Chiefs for the 2013–14 season.\nOn 20 December 2014 it was announced that James had returned to the Cardiff Blues on a two-year deal.\nAfter being released by the Blues at the end of the 2018–19 season, James signed for rival Welsh region the Scarlets. Towards the end of his second stint at the Blues, James revealed in an interview that he had been suffering from clinical depression which had caused him to miss a number of games.\nAfter a single season with the Scarlets during which injuries limited him to only two competitive appearances, James announced his retirement from professional Rugby at the end of the 2019–20 season. As of 2020 he remains the Blues' record try-scorer, with 60 tries scored.\nInternational career.\nHis rise through Welsh rugby continued and during the 2006–07 season he joined the Wales Sevens team for a number of games. Following the 2006–07 season he was called up to the Welsh national squad for the summer tour of Australia, although he did not play a game on the tour.\nDuring the build up to the 2007 Rugby World Cup he was a part of the 40 man squad and made his debut for his country against England in August 2007. When the 40 man squad was cut to 30 at the end of August, James was not selected and he returned to Cardiff Blues for the Magners League season.\nJames returned to the squad for the 2009 Wales rugby union tour of North America, starting in both matches and scoring in each test.\nOn 18 January 2010 he was named in the 35 man Wales national Squad for the 2010 Six Nations Championship.\nOn 1 June 2015 James was included in the Welsh training squad for the 2015 Rugby World Cup, and was included in the Welsh squad for the 2016 Six Nations Championship. He made what was to be his twelfth and final appearance for Wales in that year's Six Nations, against Scotland.\nPersonal life.\nHe was a Welsh athlete before turning to rugby. His older brother, Robbie, is a professional welterweight boxer and former Welsh ABA Champion."

        "text": "Robert Clayton \"Goose\" Freeman (October 19, 1932December 30, 2003) was a professional American football defensive back in the National Football League (NFL) for the Cleveland Browns, the Washington Redskins, the Green Bay Packers, and the Philadelphia Eagles. He played college football at Auburn University and was drafted in the third round of the 1955 NFL Draft.\nOn January 8, 1955 quarterback Bobby Freeman signed his first pro contract with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the WIFU. It is estimated that the 2-year contract was worth $7500 plus a signing bonus.\nIt is speculated that the contract signing resulted in Freeman dropping in the NFL draft held in late January 1955. He was selected in the 3rd round of the draft by the Cleveland Browns. Shortly after the draft, Freeman signed his second pro contract with the Browns. It was reported that this contract was worth $12,000 per season plus a $2000 signing bonus.\nIn July, Bobby Freeman was a no show at the training camp of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. Later that same month, Freeman reported to the camp of the Cleveland Browns. The Blue Bombers initiated legal action which resulted in a temporary injunction which prevented Freeman from participating in the Browns camp pending a hearing.\nThe hearing was conducted by U.S. federal Judge Paul Jones. The Blue Bombers argued that they had a signed contract and a canceled cheque indicating that Freeman had accepted payment of his signing bonus. Freeman suggested that the Winnipeg club used high pressure tactics in their contract negotiations. The Cleveland Browns argued that they had no prior knowledge of the Winnipeg contract and that Freeman was ordered to remain in the U.S. by the military.\nOn August 15, 1955, Judge Paul Jones ruled in favour of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. The Blue Bombers offered Freeman the opportunity to quarterback the team for the 1955 season under the terms of the original contract. Freeman countered by agreeing to play for Winnipeg if they offered him the same amount he agreed to with the Cleveland Browns. Coach Al Sherman turned down the Freeman request.\nFreeman remained out of football for the balance of his contract with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. In 1957, he signed with the Cleveland Browns but he never did play quarterback.\nAlthough he never played in Canada, Bobby Freeman's contract was a groundbreaking one. As a result of the ruling by Judge Paul Jones, Canadian football teams could sign contracts with American football players knowing that the contract would stand up in an American court of law."

        "text": "Kevin Michael O'Sullivan (born December 27, 1968) is an American college baseball coach and former player. O'Sullivan is the current head coach of the Florida Gators baseball team of the University of Florida. O'Sullivan is best known for leading the Gators to the program's first College World Series national championship win in 2017. O'Sullivan also led the program to three consecutive appearances in the College World Series from 2010 to 2012 and four consecutive appearances from 2015 to 2018. He became the winningest coach in program history in 2021, surpassing Dave Fuller's 1975 record of 557 wins.\nEarly years.\nO'Sullivan was born December 27, 1968, in Goshen, New York. O'Sullivan attended Jupiter High School in Jupiter, Florida, and played high school baseball for the Jupiter Warriors.\nCollege career.\nO'Sullivan was a catcher during his college playing career. He played his freshman and sophomore seasons at Florida Community College in Jacksonville, Florida. After his sophomore year, he transferred to the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia, where he played for the Virginia Cavaliers baseball team during his junior and senior years and was a member of the 1991 Atlantic Coast Conference baseball tournament All-Tournament Team.\nO'Sullivan graduated Florida Community College with an associate's degree in 1989, and the University of Virginia with a bachelor's degree in sports medicine in 1991. He later earned a master's degree in exercise science and wellness from Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida.\nCoaching career.\nIn 1997, O'Sullivan managed the Bourne Braves, a collegiate summer baseball team in the prestigious Cape Cod Baseball League, and was named coach of the year. His Bourne team featured future major leaguer Mark Mulder.\nOn September 1, 1998, O'Sullivan was named an assistant coach at Clemson University.\nO'Sullivan accepted the baseball head coaching position at the University of Florida on June 13, 2007, replacing Pat McMahon after the Gators failed to receive an NCAA tournament bid in either 2006 or 2007. Florida is O'Sullivan's first head coaching job; he is the twenty-first head coach in the history of the Gators baseball program. He spent the previous nine seasons as an assistant coach for the Clemson Tigers baseball team of Clemson University under head coach Jack Leggett, first as the Tigers' pitching coach and recruiting coordinator, and later as Leggett's associate head coach. During his tenure at Clemson, twenty-nine of the pitchers he coached were selected in the MLB Draft.\nIn each of his four seasons coaching the Gators, O'Sullivan's teams have improved their overall win–loss record and Southeastern Conference (SEC) standing. In 2008, his first season as the Gators' skipper, the team finished 34–24 overall, 17–13 in SEC play, in second place in the SEC Eastern Division standings and third in the overall SEC standings. In 2009, the Gators compiled an overall record of 42–22, 19–11 in the SEC, in first place in the SEC East. O'Sullivan's 2010 Gators finished with an overall win–loss record of 47–17, 22–8 in SEC play, and SEC regular season champions. In each of his first three seasons, his Gators also showed post-season improvement, too: early elimination in the NCAA Regional in 2008; progressing to the NCAA Super Regional in 2009; and a berth in the College World Series in 2010.\nIn 2011, the Gators finished the regular season 41–15 overall, 22–8 in the SEC, and SEC regular season co-champions—sharing the regular season conference championship with the South Carolina Gamecocks and Vanderbilt Commodores. After winning the SEC tournament, O'Sullivan's Gators received the No. 2 seed in the 2011 NCAA tournament, and advanced to their second consecutive College World Series, ultimately finishing as the national runner-up.\nO'Sullivan has also enjoyed recruiting success: his 2009 recruiting class was ranked No. 1 in the country by Collegiate Baseball Newspaper and Baseball America. It was the first time in Gators baseball history that a recruiting class was ranked No. 1.\nThrough O'Sullivan's first four regular seasons as the Gators' head coach, his Gators teams compiled the best conference win–loss record of 80–40 (.667), just ahead of the South Carolina Gamecocks (75–45) and the Vanderbilt Commodores (65–51).\nPersonal.\nO'Sullivan has one daughter, Payton, born in December 2010, and son, Finn, born in September 2012."

        "text": "Phillip Lane Johnson (born June 4, 1958) is an American college basketball coach. He was the interim men's head basketball coach at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP).\nEarly life and college career.\nAfter graduating from Putnam City High School in Warr Acres, Oklahoma in 1976, Johnson attended East Central Oklahoma State University. At East Central Oklahoma State, Johnson was basketball co-captain in his senior season. Johnson graduated from East Central Oklahoma with a B.A. in education in 1981. He then earned an M.A. from Henderson State University in 1982.\nCoaching career.\nAssistant coach and junior college head coach.\nAfter earning his master's degree, Johnson began his coaching career in 1982 at East Central Oklahoma State and coached there for three seasons. In 1985, Johnson worked his first head coaching position at Northern Oklahoma Junior College and coached there for two seasons. In 1987, Johnson became head coach at Seminole Junior College, also in Oklahoma. In his three seasons coaching Seminole, Johnson led Seminole to the 1988 state championship and 1989 Bi-State Conference championship.\nJohnson moved to the NCAA ranks in the 1990–91 season as an assistant under J. D. Barnett at Tulsa. The following season, Johnson began what would be several stints as an assistant coach under Tim Floyd at New Orleans. In Johnson's second season as assistant, New Orleans qualified for the 1993 NCAA tournament and finished the season ranked #17 in the AP Poll and first in the Sun Belt Conference.\nJohnson then became an assistant at Arizona under Lute Olson for five seasons from 1993 to 1998, including the 1997 national championship team. In every season with Johnson as assistant, Arizona was ranked in the year-end AP Polls.\nFirst stint at San Jose State.\nIn 1998, Johnson began one of two stints as San Jose State head coach. San Jose State improved from 3–23 in the 1997–98 season to 12–16 in the 1998–99 season, including wins over Jerry Tarkanian's Fresno State and Don Haskins's UTEP.\nChicago Bulls assistant.\nIn his first professional coaching position, Johnson was an assistant coach for the Chicago Bulls from 1999 to 2002, again under Tim Floyd; Johnson remained on staff under Bill Cartwright, after Floyd resigned in December 2001 following a 4–21 start.\nSecond stint at San Jose State.\nIn 2002, Johnson returned to San Jose State to be head coach. San Jose State went 7–21 in the 2002–03 season, then 6–23 the following season. On February 25, 2004, San Jose State and the Western Athletic Conference both reprimanded Johnson for what San Jose State described as a \"verbal confrontation with a UTEP fan\" during the February 19 game against UTEP. This was six years before Johnson became an assistant coach at UTEP. San Jose State athletic director Chuck Bell stated: \"While recognizing that the fan's verbal harassment of Coach Johnson throughout the game led to the confrontation, under no circumstances can a coach allow himself to be placed in a situation that jeopardizes the safety of the players and the fans in an arena.\" The same day of the reprimand, the \"San Jose Mercury News\" revealed that Johnson had a suspended driver's license due to three arrests for drunk driving from 2002 and 2003.\nSan Jose State fired Johnson after the 2004–05 season, in which San Jose State finished 6–23 for the second straight season. In 2008, the NCAA reduced the number of scholarships for San Jose State men's basketball by two, as a result of an unsatisfactory four-year Academic Progress Rate of 886 (the minimum satisfactory APR is 925) that spanned Johnson's final two seasons (2003–04 and 2004–05) and the first two seasons of succeeding head coach George Nessman (2005–06 and 2006–07).\nAssistant at USC and UTEP.\nFrom 2005 to 2010, Johnson was an assistant coach at USC under Tim Floyd. For his first four seasons at USC, Johnson served under Tim Floyd, and Johnson remained on staff in the 2009–10 season under Kevin O'Neill. Johnson helped USC make the 2007, 2008, and 2009 NCAA Tournaments and the 2009 Pac-10 tournament. However, in 2010, the NCAA vacated all of USC's wins from the 2007–08 season.\nFor the fourth time, Johnson became an assistant coach on Tim Floyd's staff in 2010, with UTEP. UTEP made the 2011 National Invitation Tournament and 2014 College Basketball Invitational in Johnson's time at UTEP.\nOn February 24, 2011, Johnson was ejected from UTEP's game at East Carolina for receiving two technical fouls.\nOn January 30, 2015, C-USA issued a reprimand to Johnson for throwing a piece of paper on the court during UTEP's game against Marshall. Johnson served as interim head coach for the February 28, 2015 game at Southern Miss because regular head coach Tim Floyd was suspended for violating league conduct policy. UTEP lost, 63-60. However, Floyd was still credited for the win.\nInterim head coach at UTEP.\nOn November 28, 2017, Johnson was named interim head coach of the Miners following Floyd's abrupt retirement."

Listed at , 159 lb., he batted and threw right-handed.\nA native of Plainfield, New Jersey, Martin played baseball for Plainfield High School.\nAfter a lengthy minor league baseball career, Martin entered the majors in 1912 as the regular shortstop for the Yankees, when they were known as the New York Highlanders. In 1914, he divided his playing time between the Boston Braves and Philadelphia Phillies.\nIn a three-year career, Martin was a .237 hitter (144-for-608) with 66 runs and 43 RBI in 187 games, including 13 doubles, four triples, 20 stolen bases, and a .323 on-base percentage without home runs.\nFollowing his playing retirement, Martin became a manager and coach in the minor leagues. He managed Jim Thorpe when Thorpe played for the 1916 Milwaukee Brewers in the American Association.\nIn 1954, Martin moved to Brick Township, New Jersey, where he lived out his twilight years. He was beloved and well known for helping his neighbors. In 1978 was honored by the Brick Township council for being an inspiration to youth, as the \"Jack Martin Boulevard\" is named after him.\nMartin suffered two heart attacks just after being introduced at the 34th annual New York Yankees Old-Timers' Day on June 21, 1980. He died 13 days later after having been hospitalized at Montefiore Hospital in The Bronx, New York. At the time of his death, at age 93, Martin was the oldest living former Yankees and Phillies player."

        "title": "Anyone for tennis?",
        "text": "The phrase \"Anyone for tennis?\" (also given as \"Tennis, anyone?\") is an English language idiom primarily of the 20th century. The phrase is used to invoke a stereotype of shallow, leisured, upper-class toffs (tennis was, particularly before the widespread advent of public courts in the later 20th century, seen as a posh game for the rich, with courts popular at country clubs and private estates). It's a stereotypical entrance or exit line given to a young man of this class in a superficial drawing-room comedy.\nUsage.\nA close paraphase of the saying, was used in George Bernard Shaw's 1914 drawing-room comedy \"Misalliance\", in which Johnny Tarleton asks \"Anybody on for a game of tennis?\" (An 1891 story in the satirical magazine \"Punch\" put a generally similar notion in the mouth of a similar type of character: \"I’m going to see if there’s anyone on the tennis-court, and get a game if I can. Ta-ta!\".)\n\"Anyone for tennis?\" is particularly associated with the early career of Hollywood star Humphrey Bogart, and he is cited as the first person to use the phrase on stage. At the start of his career, in the 1920s and early 1930s, Bogart appeared in many Broadway plays in what Jeffrey Meyers characterized as \"charming and fatuous roles – in [one of] which he is supposed to have said 'Tennis, anyone?'\".\nIf Bogart ever did speak the line, it would have presumably been in the 1925 play \"Hell's Bells\", set at the Tanglewood Lodge in New Dauville, Connecticut. Bogart claimed that his line in the play was \"It's forty-love outside. Anyone care to watch?\", and that indeed is what is printed in the script. However, according to Darwin Porter, director John Hayden crossed out that line and replaced it with \"Tennis anyone?\" before opening night. And several observers have asserted that he did say it, reportedly including Louella Parsons and Richard Watts Jr. Erskine Johnson, in a 1948 interview, reports Bogart as saying \"I used to play juveniles on Broadway and came bouncing into drawing rooms with a tennis racket under my arm and the line: 'Tennis anybody?' It was a stage trick to get some of the characters off the set so the plot could continue.\" But Bogart's usual stance was denial of using that precise phrase (\"The lines I had were corny enough, but I swear to you, never once did I have to say 'Tennis, anyone?'\"), although averring that it did characterize generally some of his early roles.\nThe phrase continued to drift through media in the 20th century and, to a diminished extent, into the 21st, often at random or just because tennis generally is the subject, rather than specifically to invoke or mock vapid toffs. It appears in the lyric of the \"Beautiful Girl Montage\" in the classic 1952 musical movie \"Singin' in the Rain\", in the Daffy Duck cartoons \"Rabbit Fire\", \"Drip-Along Daffy\" and \"The Ducksters\" (1950-1951), and in the lyric and title of the 1968 song \"Anyone for Tennis\" by the British rock band Cream, which was the theme song of the film \"The Savage Seven\". William Holden's shallow rich playboy character jokes \"tennis, anyone?\" when flirting with Joan Vohs's in the 1954 film \"Sabrina\" (in which Bogart plays another character). The television series \"Anyone for Tennyson?\" (1976–1978) riffs on the name, as does the 1981 stage play \"Anyone for Denis?\" \"Anyone for Tennis\" is the title of the B-side instrumental for Men at Work's 1981 single Who Can It Be Now?.\nThe phrase also occurs in Monty Python's spoof sketch Sam Peckinpah's \"Salad Days\".\nAlso Chris de Burgh uses this phrase in the beginning of \"Patricia the Stripper\"!"

        "title": "Terry Long (American football)",
        "text": "Terry Luther Long (July 21, 1959 – June 7, 2005) was an American college and professional football player who was an offensive lineman in the National Football League (NFL) for eight seasons during the 1980s and early 1990s. He played college football for East Carolina University, and thereafter he played professionally for the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nEarly years.\nLong was born in Columbia, South Carolina, to Levane Pickney and Robert Luther Long. He attended Eau Claire High School and graduated in 1977. One of his early jobs at the age of 14, he worked as a brick layer. After high school, Terry enlisted in the U.S. Army, and played football while stationed at Fort Bragg. Long was recruited from the military to play football for Columbia Junior College. While there, he studied for his degree in Business Administration. He'd later transfer to East Carolina, play football for that program, while still pursuing his degree. He was a four-year starter for the Pirates, and earned his degree.\nCollege career.\nLong attended East Carolina University, where he played for the East Carolina Pirates football team from 1980 to 1983. He was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American in 1983. While at college, Long was a four-year starter. In 1983, to prove his strength to NFL teams, Long competed in a powerlifting meet for the first and only time and totalled an incredible 2149.3 pounds, including a near-world record 865.3 pound deadlift; this was more than anyone lifted in that year's Powerlifting World Championships.\nProfessional career.\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers selected Long in the fourth round (111th pick overall) of the 1984 NFL Draft, and he played for the Steelers from to . During his eight NFL seasons, he played in 105 games, and started 89 of them. Long recorded three fumble recoveries and even returned a kick off during a game in 1984. As a rookie in 1984, Long started seven games, as the Steelers finished 9–7, winning the AFC Central, despite an unstable quarterback situation, with former first round selection Mark Malone and former Dolphins starter David Woodley splitting the starting duties. The next season the Steelers dipped to 7–9, and the quarterback situation did not improve, as both Malone and Woodley struggled, leading to second year pro Scott Campbell getting two starts at quarterback. That year Long played in 15 games and started 14 of them. In 1986, Long started all 16 games, but the Steelers were not winners on the field, falling to a record of 6–10. Malone continued to struggle and so did rookie Bubby Brister. Despite the ineffective quarterback play, Long had one of his best seasons. Long did not cross the picket line in 1987 when the players went on strike. In 1989, he only started in nine games, though he'd start in all 16 the following season. In 1991, his final season, he only started three games and dressed for eight.\nLegal troubles.\nIn the days leading up to his death, Long was facing a plethora of legal issues. Long had been indicted in March 2005 for arson and fraud charges from a fire that destroyed his chicken processing business. The fire occurred the same day he filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection in 2003. Though investigators quickly figured out the fire was set intentionally, it took further investigation to learn of the financial reasons behind the fire. In addition to the charges stemming from the fire, Long also faced charges regarding loans he had received from the state that were supposed to be used to purchase processing equipment for his company. On top of the charges he was facing, his home was also in foreclosure proceedings. Long had already had troubles with the law after the July 1991 incident that occurred after Steelers coach Chuck Noll informed Long that he was being suspended by the NFL for failing a test for steroids; during the conversation, Long brandished a gun.\nDeath.\nLong died on June 7, 2005. It was determined that he had consumed a full gallon of antifreeze, which was ruled a suicide. An autopsy by neuropathologist Bennet Omalu revealed that Long had CTE, a degenerative disease caused by repeated hits to the head during his football career. Long is one of at least 345 NFL players to be diagnosed after death with this disease. He had previously attempted suicide in 1991, after testing positive for the NFL's steroid test.\nLong was buried at the Swansea Methodist Church Cemetery in Swansea, South Carolina. One week before he died, Long approached the minister of his church, and asked if he could speak to the church goers about his legal issues that were about to make headlines. However, Long killed himself later that week."

        "title": "Massey Rugby Club",
        "text": "The Massey Rugby Club is a New Zealand rugby union club located in Massey, West Auckland. They are part of the North Harbour Rugby Union and compete in their competitions.\nTheir colours are red, yellow and blue Hoops, with blue shorts, and red, yellow and blue hooped socks.\nTheir premier team has been crowned North Harbour Club Rugby Champions on 6 occasions (1993, 2004, 2005, 2013, 2015, and 2016).\nNorth Harbour Reserve Championship winners(5): 1995, 1996, 2003,2004,2005\nNorth Harbour Under 21 Championship winners(2): 1993,2007\nHistory.\nBack in 1954 the pupils of the local primary school played 7 A'Side matches on an inter-school basis and in 1955 an approach was made to parents by the Hobsonville Rugby Football Club that Massey field a 15 A'Side team on Saturday mornings on a regional competitive basis. As no field was available in Massey at the time - the local Domain being in the process of development - all these games were played on the Hobsonville War Memorial Park. This arrangement lasted one season. When Massey Domain was made available for play, problems arose with the referees from the Kaipara Sub Union as this Domain was situated in the Auckland Rugby Union area and Hobsonville was in the Kaipara Sub Union.\nIn 1957 Massey was fielding three junior teams which had to travel all over the Kaipara Sub Union area. This proved too much for parents, players and supporters so on the advice of the Kaipara Sub Union it was recommended that Massey approach the Auckland Rugby Union who suggested Massey contact Waitemata Rugby Football Union at the time, and the present colours, red, yellow, and blue hoops and white shorts were approved. The shorts were changed to blue in recent years.\nIn 1971 the present club rooms were laid out and furnished through the efforts of a very hard working and far-sighted Management committee, the funds being raised in part by the lady supporters and junior teams. With only one field at Massey Domain it was difficult to have a training area and playing field in reasonable condition but Massey managed despite this. In the following year Massey formed senior teams to compete in the Auckland competition.\n1982 was a vintage year once again. The senior team won promotion to Division one and with the new club rooms at Moire Park completed and the official opening before the commencement of the 1983 season, The Massey Rugby Football club looked forward to many successful years.\nBefore the formation of the North Harbour Union in 1985 Massey were part of the Auckland Rugby Union. In the late 1970s the team won rapid promotions from the third division up to the first division. The team has historically been fed by Massey High School where all of its All Blacks, and other international players have come from.\nMassey won their first North Harbour club title in 1993 defeating East Coast Bays 25–19 in the final. 2000 was another notable year for the club as it produced two All Blacks in the same year; Troy Flavell and Ron Cribb. In 2004 and 2005 they won back to back titles, defeating Takapuna both times under the captaincy of Steve Jackson, who went on to captain the Southland NPC team in the following years.\nIn 2005 former All Black Jonah Lomu signed to play for Massey but due injury was unable to play for them that season. He did however make his debut for the club in 2006. Also in 2006 Anthony Tuitavake made the Junior All Blacks side and in 2008 was selected for the All Blacks, making him the third All Black that Massey had produced.\nMassey won their fourth premier club title in 2013, winning 39–33 over North Shore. They lost to North Shore the following year, but gained revenge in 2015 beating them 31–26 in the 3rd successive meeting between the two powerhouses of North Harbour club rugby at that time. In 2016 the same two teams met in the semi-finals with Massey prevailing with an injury time victory 13–9. They faced Takapuna in the final and used their finals experience to win a thriller 26–23 in Golden Point extra time with a drop goal by Rhema Sagote after the final siren.\nMassey have now won the North Harbour club competition in 6 of its 32 years, the same number as North Shore."

        "text": "Frank Murphy (born 2 December 1983) is a former professional rugby union player from Ireland who works as a referee for the Irish Rugby Football Union. He primarily played as a scrum-half. Originally from Cork, Murphy played for his native province of Munster before moving to the English side Leicester Tigers.\nMurphy began refereeing in the All-Ireland League in 2015, progressing to referee in the British and Irish Cup later that year. He began refereeing at international level in 2016, and has taken charge of games in the European Nations Cup. In November 2016, Murphy took charge of his first Pro12 game, and has since gone on to referee in the Challenge Cup at European level.\nEarly life.\nMurphy grew up in Crosshaven, a village in south County Cork, and began his playing career with the local team, Crosshaven RFC. In his final year of secondary school, he went on to play with Christian Brothers College, Cork. While playing with the Christian Brothers team, he won the Munster Schools Senior Cup, beating Rockwell College in the final.\nPlaying career.\nMunster.\nMurphy went on to play at senior level for his native provincial team, Munster. Murphy made his debut for the side on 17 October 2003, in a 2003–04 Celtic League match, away against Welsh side Newport Gwent Dragons. He came off the bench, replacing Eoin Reddan in a match Munster went on to lose 29–6. Murphy made a total of nine appearances in the league that season, with all but one of them coming from the bench.\nIn the 2004–05 Celtic League Murphy made only two appearances, starting on both occasions, while in the 2005–06 Celtic League he made one start and three appearances as a replacement. Murphy left Munster at the end of the 2005–06 having made 15 appearances for the senior team, and joined English Premiership side Leicester Tigers.\nLeicester Tigers.\nMurphy joined Leicester ahead of the 2006–07 season, and was one of a number of Irishmen in a Tigers squad that included Geordan Murphy, Shane Jennings, Leo Cullen and Ian Humphreys. Murphy made his debut on 9 September 2009, coming on as a replacement against Bath in the 2006–07 Premiership. He made his first start against London Irish on 18 November that year. Murphy made his European debut for the Tigers on 13 January 2007 in the 2006–07 Heineken Cup as a replacement against Cardiff Blues. In his first season with the club, Murphy made 16 Premiership appearances, starting on 9 occasions. At the end of the season Murphy appeared in both the Premiership final and Heineken Cup final. Murphy started the Premiership final against Gloucester as Leicester won 44–16, with Murphy scoring one of Leicester's tries. He also started the Heineken Cup final against London Wasps, only his second ever appearance in a European match. The opposition scrum-half on the day was Murphy's former Munster teammate Eoin Reddan. The Tigers came out second best, losing 25–9 at Twickenham.\nIn his second season with Leicester, Murphy featured in fewer Premiership games, but played more often in European matches. He played in 13 2007–08 Premiership games, starting 8 of these as Leicester finished in fourth, but made it to the final. Murphy did not feature in either the semi-final or the final as Leicester lost to Wasps. In Europe, Murphy started six games for the Tigers and came off the bench in another in the 2007–08 Heineken Cup as his side came second in their pool, but missed out on the knockout rounds. Murphy left Leicester Tigers in 2008 and returned to Ireland, joining the western province of Connacht.\nConnacht.\nMurphy moved to Connacht ahead of the 2008–09 season. He made his debut for the side in the 2008–09 Celtic League against Welsh side the Ospreys on 5 September 2008, starting for Connacht and playing the full match. Murphy made 16 appearances in the league that season, starting in all but one of these games. Murphy made his European debut for the province on 10 October 2008 against French side Dax in the 2008–09 European Challenge Cup. He started in six games for Connacht in the cup as they finished as runners-up in their pool and made it to the quarter-finals of the competition.\nIn the 2009–10 season, Murphy continued as Connacht's first choice scrum-half. He played in 14 of Connacht's 18 games in the 2009–10 Celtic League, starting all but two of these. At European level, Murphy played in all of Connacht's 2009–10 Challenge Cup games as they reached the semi-final, being beaten 19–12 at the Sportsgrounds by Toulon. In the following season, Murphy played in 21 of Connacht's games under new coach Eric Elwood in the 2010–11 Celtic League, which had been expanded to 12 teams. Murphy played in all six of Connacht's games in the 2010–11 Challenge Cup, starting five of them, as Connacht failed to make it past the pool stage. Over the course of these seasons, Murphy would, on occasion, serve as captain of Connacht.\nIn the 2011–12 season, Connacht qualified for their first ever Heineken Cup. Ahead of Connacht's first season in the top tier of European rugby, the team signed another scrum-half, Paul O'Donohoe from Leinster. Murphy remained Connacht's first choice in the position, playing 20 games in the 2011–12 league, which had been renamed the \"Pro12\". In the Heineken Cup, however, Murphy started only two of the side's six games, coming on as a replacement in a further two.\nAhead of the 2012–13 season Murphy suffered a cruciate ligament injury, which kept him out for most of the season. At the same time a hamstring injury sidelined O'Donohoe. In their absence, academy scrum-half Kieran Marmion excelled, and went on to start every game that season. Murphy mad only a single substitute appearance that season, coming in the 2012–13 Pro12.\nMarmion continued as Connacht's first choice in the 2013–14 season, with Murphy and O'Donohoe mostly making appearances as replacements. On 27 December 2013 Murphy made his one hundredth appearance for Connacht, starting against his former team Munster in the Pro12, in a 22–16 defeat. In total, Murphy made seven appearances in the league for the season, six of these appearances coming from the bench. In Europe, Murphy played in only one game during the season, coming off the bench in a famous victory over Toulouse in the 2013–14 Heineken Cup.\nIn April 2014, it was announced that Murphy's contract with Connacht was not being renewed and he would be leaving the province at the end of the season. He was one of a number of high-profile departures that included fellow centurion Gavin Duffy and former Scottish international fly-half Dan Parks. Murphy retired from professional rugby after leaving Connacht.\nRefereeing career.\nFollowing his retirement from playing rugby, Murphy started to work as a referee in the sport as a way of staying in the game. Murphy progressed quickly through the IRFU's Inter Provincial Appointments System, and in February 2015 was added to the union's National Panel of Referees, officiating in All-Ireland League matches. He began refereeing in the semi-professional British and Irish Cup in the 2015–16 season. Murphy refereed his first international match in February 2016, when he took charge of a European Nations Cup game between and . On 27 November 2016, Murphy refereed his first Pro12 game, between Newport Gwent Dragons and Edinburgh. "

They last met in the 1998 Western Conference Final where Detroit won in six games. This was Detroit's second consecutive Conference finals appearance; they lost to the Anaheim Ducks in six games in the previous year. Dallas last made the conference finals in 2000, where they defeated the Colorado Avalanche in seven games. Detroit won three of the four games during this year's regular season series.\nThe Red Wings defeated the Stars in six games. Detroit scored three power-play goals as they took game one 4–1. Red Wings' goaltender Chris Osgood made 17 saves in game two to give Detroit a 2–1 win. Stars' forward Mike Ribeiro was assessed a match penalty at the end of game two for retaliating to an earlier stick infraction with a two-handed slash to Chris Osgood's chest; neither players were suspended. Detroit forward Pavel Datsyuk scored a hat-trick in game three for the Red Wings; while Osgood stopped 16 shots for the 5–2 win. Marty Turco made 33 saves as the Stars avoided elimination in game four winning 3–1. Turco continued his strong play for Dallas in game five as he stopped 38 shots in a 2–1 victory. The Red Wings used the strength of a three-goal first period in game six to eliminate the Stars and return to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 2002.\nStanley Cup Finals.\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. Both teams won their last appearance in the Finals; Detroit defeated Carolina in five games in 2002, while Pittsburgh swept Chicago in four games in 1992. The teams did not play each other during this year's regular season.\nPlayer statistics.\nSkaters.\nThese are the top ten skaters based on points. If the list exceeds ten skaters because of a tie in points, all of the tied skaters are shown.\nGoaltending.\nThis is a combined table of the top five goaltenders based on goals against average and the top five goaltenders based on save percentage with at least 420 minutes played. The table is sorted by GAA, and the criteria for inclusion is bolded.\nTelevision.\nNational Canadian English-language coverage of the playoffs were split between the CBC and TSN, with the CBC holding exclusive rights to the Stanley Cup Finals. French-language telecasts were broadcast on RDS and RDS2. This marked the last season that all playoff games involving Canadian teams had to air on the CBC instead of TSN, even if it mean they had to be broadcast regionally. Under new contracts that would take effect in 2009, the CBC and TSN would began to select the rights to individual series using a draft-like setup, regardless if they involved Canadian teams.\nIn the United States, coverage was split between NBC and Versus. During the first three rounds, NBC primarily televised weekend afternoon games and Versus aired evening games. During the first and second round, excluding games exclusively broadcast on NBC, the regional rights holders of each participating U.S. team produced local telecasts of their respective games. Not all first and second-round games were nationally televised, while the conference finals were exclusively broadcast on either NBC or Versus. Versus then aired games one and two of the Stanley Cup Finals while NBC televised the remainder of the series."

This state-of-the-art stadium opened with Citizens First Opening Night on April 17, 2009, to a standing room only crowd of 6,886. The Bowling Green Hot Rods defeated the Kannapolis Intimidators 8–4 in this much anticipated opening game that brought professional baseball to Bowling Green for the first time in 67 years. Many ceremonial \"first\" pitches were thrown, and the starting lineup of the Hot Rods were driven onto the field by locally owned vintage Hot Rods. The offices for the Bowling Green Hot Rods and several other touches were finally completed after the 2009 season.\nThe ballpark is also used occasionally by the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers baseball team to host high profiles games, such as the 2017 and 2019 game against the Kentucky Wildcats baseball.\nBallpark Features.\nBowling Green Ballpark was designed by architectural firm DLR Group. The right-centerfield wall in Bowling Green Ballpark is unique in that it is concave in right-center because of the shape of a pre-existing road behind the field. The scoreboard in right-centerfield measures 35-feet tall and 56-feet wide, with the ability to show scoring, live video, advertisements, player statistics, and more. Embedded in the left field wall is a 6-foot, 3inch tall by 68-foot wide LED display board, behind which is a picnic area. There are two grass lawn seating areas- one in left-center and one at the right field line.

        "title": "Cricket South Africa",
        "text": "Cricket South Africa (CSA) is the governing body for both professional and amateur cricket in South Africa. In 1991, the separate South African Cricket Union and the South African Cricket Board merged to form the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCB), ending enforced racial separation governance in South African cricket. Cricket South Africa was formed in 2002, and initially ran parallel to the UCB, before becoming the sole governing body in 2008. As an affiliate of the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC), and a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC), CSA administers all levels of cricket in South Africa, including the national teams in all three formats for both men and women.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nOrganised cricket has been taking place in South Africa since the British first introduced the sport in the 1880s. England were the first side to tour South Africa in 1888-89, playing their first Test match at Port Elizabeth and becoming the third Test playing nation after England and Australia.\nSince 1890, various national bodies have formed and governed cricket in South Africa. Originally, this was along separate racial lines and South Africa regularly played only against the other white teams of England, Australia and New Zealand. In 1970, after recent incidents such as the D'Oliveira affair, the ICC imposed an cricketing ban on South Africa in response to its domestic policy of apartheid and its refusal to field non-whites or play non-white teams. The Test careers of players were cut prematurely short, some of whom later emigrated and played for other nations.\nDuring South Africa's expulsion from international cricket, a number of different organisations ran domestic cricket depending on the various racial groups. The South African Cricket Association (SACA) administered white players, with the South African Cricket Board of Control (SACBOC) and the South African African Cricket Board (SAACB) administering the different non-white racial groups. The cricketing boycott had a significant impact on the domestic game. Standards, attendances, and participation fell, and South African expulsion meant that domestic cricket became deprived of new revenue streams.\nAs South African cricket continued to be excluded, ‘Rebel Tours’ (unofficial international teams coming to South Africa to play), were organised by the SACU during the 1980s. Despite disapproval by international cricket boards, national governments and the ICC, seven tours were staged in South Africa between 1982 and 1990. Players who joined ‘rebel tours’ ran risks to their own careers and reputations. Many faced ostracization when they returned home, as well as a cricketing ban. The SACU offered money as an incentive for Rebel Teams to tour. Teams from England, Australia, and also the West Indies and Sri Lanka played 19 Tests and numerous One Day Internationals between them against South Africa in these unofficial tours.\nIn June 1991, the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCB) was established following the unity process and the amalgamation of the SACU and the SACB, ending racial segregation within South African cricket. Former SACB president Krish Mackerdhuj was elected as the inaugural UCB president. In July, South Africa was readmitted as a full member of the ICC.\nIn 2002, Cricket South Africa (CSA) was formed and operated in conjunction with the UCB. CSA was responsible for and administered the professional game, and the UCB oversaw amateur cricket in South Africa. In 2008, CSA and the UCB merged, reportedly for tax reasons, with CSA becoming the sole governing body for both professionals and amateurs.\nMismanagement.\nIn recent years, Cricket South Africa was rocked by significant amounts of turmoil and disorganisation that has caused notable reputational harm, both at home and abroad.\nIn 2012 Gerald Majola, CEO of CSA since 2000, was suspended and later dismissed following a scandal into unauthorised bonuses. An internal investigation had initially exonerated Majola of any wrongdoing. However a government inquiry later found that he, and several other staff members, had failed to declare a collective US$671,428 in bonuses after South Africa hosted the 2009 IPL and Champions Trophy. Both CSA President Mtytzeli Nyoka and his acting replacement, AK Khan, resigned in the aftermath of the scandal. The government inquiry subsequently recommended that CSA should be restructured.\nHaroon Lorgat, CEO since 2013, 'mutually agreed to part ways with immediate effect' from CSA in September 2017 after his position became untenable following allegations that he had deliberately withheld critical financial information from the board of directors. Lorgat had been embattled with the CSA board over the financial expenditure of the now abandoned Global League T20. With tournament outlay alone totaling US$330,000 between May 2016 and April 2017, the league had yet to secure a broadcaster and title sponsor a month before the competition was due to start.\nUnder Thanang Moroe, CEO from 2017 to 2020, Cricket South Africa spiraled into numerous crises. A series of high-profile controversies and disagreements with the South African Cricketers Association relating to league restructuring, broadcasting rights, and various administration issues overtook CSA. In December 2019 Moroe was suspended, and later dismissed, following an independent forensic report that had uncovered multiple incidents of financial dishonesty where board money had been paid to private companies for a service that was never delivered. Throughout this time, CSA had refused to publish the final non-redacted \"Funduszi Report\" that had investigated alleged wrongdoing and negligence dating back to 2016 within the organisation. As a consequence, in October 2020 the entire Board of Directors resigned with immediate effect. The South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) announced that they had suspended Cricket South Africa due to \"maladministration and malpractices\", and had taken over cricketing operations in the country. The acting CEO since July 2020, Kugandrie Govender, (the first woman in the position) herself was suspended four months later, pending the outcome of a hearing into allegations of misconduct during her time as Chief Commercial Officer, as well as acting CEO. She was later dismissed with immediate effect in July 2021.\nIn January 2021, Cricket South Africa appointed Pholetsi Moseki, the former CFO, as acting CEO - the third CEO since the beginning of 2020. In April, the interim board and the Members Council reached an agreement over organisational reforms at the eleventh hour after the South African Government threatened to defund the organisation and remove recognition for all the country's national teams - effectively ending organised cricket in the country. The International Cricket Council had also announced that it could suspend South Africa due to government interference in the sport, which is against ICC rules. Zimbabwe Cricket has twice been suspended for political intervention by the ICC, most recently in 2019.\nNew era.\nIn June 2021, a new board of directors was appointed. For the first time, the majority of the board was made up of independents (i.e., outside CSA current administrative or operational circles). A key focus of the new board has been rebuilding relations with all stakeholders (internal and external), and stabilising operations by recruiting for vacant positions in what had previously been a severely depleted management team, including several key executive positions.\nOrganisation.\nStructure.\nCSA is governed by two internal organisation structures with a joint purpose of delivering responsible administration of the game, as well as to nurture sustainable growth and business investment for South African cricket.\nThe highest decision-making body at CSA is the Members Council, which is formed by the 14 Affiliate Presidents plus the President and Vice President of CSA, who were themselves elected from the ranks of the Affiliate Presidents, to make a total of 16. The Affiliates administer amateur and senior provincial cricket in their respective regions, \"i.e.\" Northern Cape, Free State, KwaZulu-Natal, etc. The Members Council sets general policy for CSA.\nIn terms of CSA's Memorandum of Incorporation (\"MOI\"), the Board is currently composed of five non-independent directors (who are Presidents or representatives of Affiliates, and therefore involved with cricket) and eight independent directors, \"i.e\", persons who, apart from their CSA directorships, are not involved with cricket. Independent directors were selected and nominated for appointment by persons were also independent of CSA. The term of office for directors is three years, and a director is eligible for elections for an additional three-year term. Strategic direction of the organisation and management of daily operations is the primary responsibility of the Board of Directors, and is performed through CSA committees and internal control procedures.\nThroughout, close consultation is kept with the South African Cricketers Association (SACA), who represent the interests and welfare of the players.\nTransformation.\nCSA maintain that their continued vision is to ensure that cricket is supported by the majority of South Africans, and that the game is available to all. Although a previous racial quota was repealed in 2007, since 2016 ‘transformation’ targets, although highly controversial, have been set by CSA in order to ensure that more South Africans of colour achieve greater representation at the national level. The percentage of black African players required in a team currently stands at 25%, up from 18% the previous season. In 2021–22, this was to increase to 27% and in 2022–23, it was to sit at 33%. Overall, the numbers of players of colour required was to increase to 63% by 2022–23, from 58%. National teams must field six players of colour, of which at least two must be black African. These quotas however are for an average across the course of a season and are not enforced for individual matches.\nA further memorandum had stated from August 2020 that white consultants would no longer be appointed by CSA, unless a person of colour could not be found during the recruitment process. In January 2021, it was announced by the interim board that all previous transformation targets adopted by CSA, including the affirmative action against hiring white consultants, would be suspended for the foreseeable future.\nNational teams - the Proteas.\nMen's.\nTest - Having hosted and played their first international first-class game against England in 1888–89, South Africa developed into a competitive team by the start of the 20th century.\nODI - South Africa have reached the ODI World Cup Semi-Finals four times, most recently in 2015, but never progressed further.\nT20I - Appearing in 7 T20 World Cups, the Proteas have been semi-finalists twice, most recently in 2014.\nWomen’s.\nTest - Making their debut in 1960 against England, the women's team did not play any international fixtures between 1972 and 1997. The Proteas have played just 13 Test matches, with the most recent being in 2022, and winning only one. With a win rate of only 8% as of 2021, T20 has taken on a far more prominent and financially rewarding role, almost ending women's Test cricket as a viable entity.\nODI - The women's team played their first One Day International against Ireland in 1997, and have a win rate as of 2021 of roughly 50% over nearly 200 matches. Playing in six Women's World Cups, the Proteas have been semi-finalists twice, in 2000 and 2017, although never progressing further.\nT20I - The Proteas’ first T20I was in 2007 against Australia, and have since played over 100 matches. Competing in 6 Women's T20 World Cups, South Africa have been semi-finalists in 2014 and in 2020.\nDomestic competitions.\nCSA organises and oversees a range of domestic competitions within the country. In 2021, Cricket South Africa announced a return to the traditional province based domestic structure. 15 first-class teams now play in two divisions, determined by promotion and relegation. Eight teams make up the first division, with 16 contracted players each, and seven teams the second division, with 11 contracted players each. It is hoped that wider selection of teams at the highest domestic level will help increase playing opportunities of all races, particularly those currently underrepresented.\nSouth Africa's major domestic competitions are:\nFirst Class - CSA 4-Day Series\nList A - CSA One Day Cup\nT20 - CSA T20 Challenge /\nSA20\nFor women, CSA Provincial Cricket is currently the top level of cricket in South Africa, however it remains semi-professional. Since 2019, South African women have played in the Women's T20 Super League. CSA have said that the competition will allow top performing players from across the under-19s and provincial cricket to continue and improve domestic standards.\nDevelopment, youth and grass roots.\nCricket South Africa offers programmes that cover the development of the amateur and professional game, for both men and women. CSA provides regional and district programmes, often via their Performance Centres. Starting at the ages of four to thirteen, more than 126,000 school children have participated in the KFC Mini-Cricket programme, while the number of coaches and schools participating has increased to nearly 14,000 and 7,000 respectively.  \nNational inter-provincial tournaments are played at under-13, under-15, under-17 and under-19 levels for boys, and at under-15 and under-19 levels for girls. Through the Talent Acceleration Programme, the best players can be identified, particularly disadvantaged cricketers. Initiatives are available that provide financial support for deprived young cricketers, through the Sunfoil Education Trust (SET), the Momentum Bursary Trust, and the SASCOC Bursary Programme. From Youth to International progression, CSA provides support through Provincial and Regional Academies, as well the National Academy and the High Performance Centre.\nFinances and sponsorship.\nIn the years before COVID-19 in South Africa, CSA had reported a declared loss of R200m for the 2018-19 financial year, and profit of R50m for 2019–20. Due to the pandemic, as well as organisational instability, CSA forecasted major losses of R654m (£32m) by the end of its four year in 2022 due to the effect on hosting tours, introducing the Mzanzi Super League, and restructuring the domestic game. Whilst the SA Cricketers Association puts that figure closer to R1bn (£50m), CSA now project a revised figure of R400 (£19m) due to tours going ahead and new sponsorship agreements. So far, CSA has not undertaken any job or pay cuts and has reported cash reserves of R800m (£39m). CSA have agreed a broadcast deal with \"Star India\" in November 2020 for a reported R1.5bn (£72m) over the next four years to 2024. Another arrangement with South African broadcaster \"SuperSport\" was set to be negotiated before April 2021, alongside potential new sponsorship deals and existing television rights.\nIn September 2020, the financial services giant Momentum confirmed that it would not seek to renew its sponsorship agreement with CSA, affecting the ODIs, the franchise one-day cup, the national club champions, the under-13, under-15 and under-17 competitions and initiatives. Momentum will however continue to sponsor the national women's team under 2023, but stated they will continue to advise CSA to resolve its administrative plight as a matter of urgency.\nMomentum is not the only major sponsor to separate from CSA since the start of its instability crisis in December 2019. Standard Bank opted not to continue their support for the national Test team, as well as the CSA development programmes.\nThe sunflower oil producer Sunfoil, who had sponsored the first-class four-day competition, similarly decided not to renew their sponsorship in 2019."

Williams played collegiately at Purdue University where he was a 2x All-Big Ten guard (1948–49, 1949–50); he was selected as the Purdue team MVP in his junior and senior seasons and as Team Captain in 1949-50; posting a career total of 735 points (10.0 game avg). He led the Big Ten Conference in Free Throw Percentage (85.7%) for the 1948-49 season.\nHe was a 3rd Round pick of the Minneapolis Lakers in the 1950 NBA draft but chose instead to sign a contract with the Peoria Caterpillars of the American Athletic Union and the National Industrial Basketball League. The Caterpillars finished 4th in the NIBL but won the National AAU title (the first of three consecutive titles), knocking off the regular season champions, the Phillips Oilers in the semi-finals on Williams last second bucket. Williams and the rest of the Caterpillar team defeated the NCAA Champion Kansas Jayhawks in the AAU Title game.

        "title": "Ed Crane (baseball)",
        "text": "Edward Nicholas Crane (May 27, 1862 – September 20, 1896), nicknamed \"Cannonball\", was an American right-handed pitcher and outfielder in Major League Baseball for eight seasons. He played for the Boston Reds (1884), Providence Grays (1885), Buffalo Bisons (1885), Washington Nationals (1886), New York Giants (NL) (1888–89, 1892–93), New York Giants (PL) (1890), Cincinnati Kelly's Killers (1891), Cincinnati Reds (1891), and Brooklyn Grooms (1893). Crane was the first pitcher in the history of major league baseball to record 4 strikeouts in a single inning (New York Giants, 1888), and is one of the few players to play in four major leagues: the Union Association, the National League, the Players' League, and the American Association.\nBorn in Boston, Cannonball Crane was a man of uncommon strength. In his prime, he was described as \"a giant in physical strength and proportions.\" He reportedly could throw a baseball 135 yards, farther than anyone else who played the game in his era. After his playing career ended, he died from what was officially declared an accidental overdose but was reported by others to have been a suicide.\nEarly years (1884–87).\nCannonball debuted in April 1884 with the Boston Reds of the Union Association. He played in 101 games for the Reds, including 57 as an outfielder and 42 as a catcher. As a rookie, he was among the UA league leaders in most batting categories, with 12 home runs (2nd in the UA), a .451 slugging percentage (4th in the UA), 193 total bases (4th in the USA), 41 extra base hits (5th in the UA), 59 runs (7th in the UA), 122 hits (8th in the UA), and a .285 batting average (10th in the UA).\nAfter a promising rookie year, Crane moved to the National League where he did not fare as well. In 1885, Crane played in the National League for the Providence Grays and Buffalo Bisons but appeared in only 14 games, all as an outfielder.\nIn 1886, he played in 80 games for the Washington Nationals, including 68 games as an outfielder and 10 games (70 innings) as a pitcher. His performance as a batter dropped off dramatically, as his batting average plummeted to .171 and he struck out 54 times. He did not fare much better as a pitcher, with a record of 1–7, an earned run average of 7.20 and an Adjusted ERA+ of 45.\nWith a dismal performance in 1886, Crane did not find a spot in the major leagues in 1887. Instead, Crane went to Canada and had a tremendous season for the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1887. He won the International League batting title in 1887, hitting for a .428 average (bases on balls counted as hits for the 1887 season in the Int’l League.) His .428 average in 1887 still stands as the highest batting average by a pitcher in professional baseball. He also set the all-time Maple Leafs’ record with 33 wins, as he led the Maple Leafs to their first International League pennant. On one occasion in 1887, Crane won both games of a Saturday doubleheader and also hit the game-winning home run in the second game.\nThe New York Giants and Spalding's World Tour (1888–90).\nAfter a great showing for the Maple Leafs, Crane signed with the New York Giants where he played in 1888 and 1889. In the 1888 season, Crane was 5–6 for the pre-modern World Series champion Giants. Crane accomplished two baseball firsts in 1888. On September 27, 1888, Crane became the first player in New York Giants’ history to throw a no-hitter. In a seven-inning game that was called due to darkness, Cannonball Crane held the Senators hitless in a 3–0 victory at the Polo Grounds. Crane retired six batters on ground balls to himself and struck out five Senators. The following week, on October 4, 1888, Crane became the first pitcher in major league history to strike out four batters in one inning.\nIn the 1889 season, Crane pitched in 29 games (25 as a starter) and had a much improved record of 14–10 and earned run average of 2.43 in 230 innings. Crane's career reached its pinnacle in the 1889 World Series, as Crane was the hero on the mound and at the plate. On the mound, Crane started 5 games and won 4, pitching 38 innings with a 3.79 ERA. At the plate, Crane had 5 RBIs, a .611 slugging percentage, scored 3 runs, a double, a triple, and a home run. An October 1889 newspaper account in \"The World\" described Crane's World Series performance as follows: \"Ed Crane, fat and jolly, went into the pitcher's box for New York... Ed shot them in with terrific speed and brought joy to the New Yorkers, who saw the Grooms [i.e., Brooklyn Bridegrooms] succumb, one after another, to his invincible 'curves' and 'shoots'.\"\nThe newspaper's reference to Crane as \"fat and jolly\" was not the first such reference to Crane's girth. He won the nickname \"Cannonball\" due to his large size. He reportedly loved to eat and weighed 204 pounds at 5'10\". (Tom Schott, Nick Peters, \"The Giants Encyclopedia\", p. 406.) Another book described Crane as a \"prodigious eater\" whose favorite snack consisted of \"an order of a dozen soft-boiled eggs served in a soup bowl, which he liked to top off with an order of two dozen clams.\" (Lee Allen, \"\"The Cincinnati Reds\" (1948)\", p. 43)\nAfter reaching the high point of his career in the 1889 World Series, Crane's life began a downhill spiral that fall. After the 1889 season, Crane traveled on the famous Spalding World Tour where he developed a taste for alcohol. The tour included 20 of the best players in baseball and covered Asia and Europe, lasting until early April 1890. One newspaper reported: \"Until then, he never drank, but when the aggregation reached Paris Crane fell. . . . When he reached America again not only could he drink champagne but he had acquired a taste for less expensive drinks.\" The world tour was reportedly the \"turning point\" in Crane's life, as drinking eventually left him \"without employment and incapacitated for work.\" A full account of Crane's time on the Spalding world tour can be found in the Mark Lamster book, \"\"Spalding's World Tour: The Epic Adventure that Took Baseball Around the Globe—and Made It America's Game\".\"\nAfter returning from the Spalding tour, Crane joined the Players' League movement (a competing league formed by the players in 1890) and played with many of his former teammates for the newly formed New York Giants of the Players' League. He had a record of 16–19 and an ERA of 3.68 in innings. Starting in 1890, Crane's control began to fail, as he gave up walks at a historic pace. In 1890, he gave up 210 bases on balls—the 13th highest single season total in major league history. He followed with 203 walks in 1891 and 189 in 1892—both years ranking among the highest single season totals of all time.\nLater years and death (1891–96).\nIn 1891, Crane played for Kelly's Killers and led the American Association with a 2.45 ERA (Adjusted ERA+ of 169) and 25 complete games in 250 innings. He spent the last part of the 1891 season with the Cincinnati Reds and finished the year with an 18–22 record. He followed in 1892 with a 24-loss record for the New York Giants. His major league career ended in 1893 as the 31-year-old Crane split the season between the Giants and the Brooklyn Grooms.\nAfter being released by Brooklyn, Crane played with Toronto and then with Providence and Rochester. The 1896 season proved to be his last, and playing for Rochester, \"he proved to be a failure but played the season out.\" According to his obituary, \"his arm was in poor shape\", and he was released by Rochester. He was then picked up by Springfield, where he \"fared no better.\" He umpired a few games for Rochester but was released by the league president.\nAfter his final release, the 34-year-old Crane spent the last few weeks of his life \"going about the country\" picking up odd jobs and \"drinking harder and harder.\" On the day before his death, he was given notice that he would have to vacate his room (in a Rochester, New York hotel) the next day. He had been drinking heavily all day, and when he retired \"seemed to be very gloomy.\" The next morning, Crane was found dead in his bed. A coroner's inquest was conducted, and the official verdict was an \"accidental death from taking a chloral prescription for nervousness.\" Despite the coroner's verdict, others reported that Crane committed suicide by drinking acid. Crane was survived by a wife and child.\nCannonball Crane in modern literature.\nIn 1996, Canadian poet Bruce Meyer published a book \"Goodbye Mr. Spalding\", which includes a story titled \"Sunlight Park.\" Sunlight Park was the name of the first ballpark in Toronto. Meyer chronicles Cannonball Crane's performance in leading the Maple Leafs to Toronto's first baseball championship in 1887 pennant and, a century later, a grieving father's drive to uncover the events surrounding Cannonball's death. Unable to confront the death of his teenage son, the father chooses, instead, to unravel the secret of Crane's final days. His desire to learn the truth transports him through time to an imagined meeting with Cannonball. Their \"interview\" resolves the mystery of Crane's apparent suicide and helps the father accept the death of his son."

        "text": "Vert skateboarding, short for vertical skateboarding, is the act of riding a skateboard on a skate ramp or other incline and involves the skateboarder transitioning from the horizontal plane to the vertical plane in order to perform skateboarding tricks.\nHistory.\nVert skateboarding has its genesis in \"pool riding\" - the riding of skateboards in an emptied backyard swimming pool - during the 1970s. As riders moved from general street skateboarding and occasional \"pool riding\" into purpose-built skate parks, vert skateboarding became more popular. Skateboarders began to develop, and then practice, tricks and techniques specifically for vert skateboarding.\nVert skateboarding became a common style of skateboarding and was introduced into many competitions and events including the X Games and the Maloof Money Cup.\nIn 2008 ESPN and X Games organisers announced that vert skateboarding would be removed from X Games competitions in favour of free-movement skate-park-style courses where participants would still be able to perform vert skateboarding tricks but would need to do so in combination with other street skateboarding elements. After public condemnation from professional skateboarders Bob Burnquist, Tony Hawk and others, organisers re-instated vert skateboarding.\nHowever, in 2011 ESPN announced that the X Games would no longer feature a \"Women's Vert Skateboarding\" event, citing a lack of, \"a growing participant base, an established annual competition schedule\" and, \"myriad other factors\". Professional skateboarder Lyn-Z Adams Hawkins said the decision would, \"end the growth for women's vert skating as we know it\".\nSkateboard set-up.\nFor vert skateboarding, riders usually set up their boards with wheels (or larger) and wider decks for more stability."

        "text": "Charles Reid (14 January 1864 – 25 October 1909) was a Scotland international rugby union player.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nReid attended Edinburgh Academy, and played rugby union for the Edinburgh Academicals . He was still a schoolboy of the academy when first capped by Scotland. In the match against in 1881, he played against his classmate Frank Wright at Raeburn Place. Frank Wright was also seventeen at the time but - as a boarder from Manchester - represented the England side. At the end of the match, both of the boys were carried on the shoulders of their fans back to Edinburgh Academy. He acquired a nickname of Hippo at the school; this does not refer to his being like a hippopotamus, but the fact that he didn't know the word for a horse, when asked once in an Ancient Greek class at the Edinburgh Academy.\nAfter his schooling, he still played for Edinburgh Academicals.\nHe later played for Perthshire.\nProvincial career.\nHe played for Edinburgh District in the inter-city match against Glasgow District in 1880.\nHe later turned out for East of Scotland District that same season in their match against West of Scotland District in 1881.\nInternational career.\nHe was capped twenty-one times for between 1881 and 1888. Reid vies with Ninian Finlay for the title of the youngest player ever to be capped for - he was seventeen years and thirty six days old when he was capped against on 19 February 1881; however, Reid had lived through an extra leap year day, when he was capped in 1881, so Finlay generally gets that title. He played at second row/lock.\nAs Allan Massie says, \nReid was 15 to 16 stone in weight, and 6 ft 3in. The first historian of Scottish rugby, R.J. Phillips says that Reid \"carried no superfluous weight and was as active as a well-trained ten-stone man\", but that also, from his viewpoint in the 1920s, he was \"Scotland's greatest forward.\"\nHe played alongside some of the greats of the era including Ninian Finlay, Andrew Don Wauchope and Bill Maclagan. He was said to be a proficient tackler, excellent at dribbling and Scotland only lost four times in his twenty one caps. He captained Scotland in 1887 to their first Home Championship win, and also won scored tries.\nHe maintained an interest in rugby long after retiring from the game, and after the positional changes in the early 1890s, he wrote boldly:\nHowever, Massie disagrees with this statement, and says that over-dependence on aggressive forward play such as that supported by Reid led to European sides being beaten thoroughly by and when they toured.\nOutside of rugby Reid was also a noted exponent of the shot put. At the inaugural Scottish Athletics Championships in 1883 he placed third in the event, was second in 1884 and 1885, becoming Scottish champion in both 1886 and 1887.\nMedical career.\nHe was a doctor by profession, and practised in Selkirk. He then lived at Craigie wfor several years, and moved to Swindon in 1903 where he went into partnership with Dr. J. Campbell Maclean. \nFamily.\nHe was the brother of James Reid, who was capped five times for Scotland from 1871 to 1875, including the very first rugby international. He was married in Swindon, however this was short lived as his wife died 18 months later.  \nDeath.\nReid had started to suffer from ill health whist in Selkirk. He died in a in a surgical home in London after several operations. His body was returned to Swindon and was buried in the same plot as his wife in Radnor Street Cemetery on 29th October 1909."

        "text": "The 1927 Stanley Cup Finals was played by the Ottawa Senators and the Boston Bruins. It was the first time the Cup was solely contested by National Hockey League teams, owing to the demise of the Western Hockey League the previous year. It was won by the Ottawa Senators, coached by Dave Gill, over the Boston Bruins, coached by Art Ross. This was the Senators' fourth win since 1920, and eleventh overall, but it marked the end of the dynasty. The original Senators would not win another.\nIt would be the last time a team from Ottawa would play in the Finals until the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals, and the first Stanley Cup Finals to have games played in both Canada and the United States.\nGame summaries.\nThe Stanley Cup Finals was originally intended to be a best-of-three series. After the first game was declared a draw, NHL president Frank Calder ruled that the series would go no more than five games, with overtimes limited to 20 minutes. If the teams were tied after five games, the teams would share the championship. In the end, the series went four games because of two ties. These were the last ties in Stanley Cup history, notwithstanding the unfinished 3–3 Stanley Cup Finals match between Edmonton and Boston on May 24, 1988. Ottawa's Frank Nighbor was playing in his sixth Stanley Cup series, while Boston's Sprague Cleghorn and Billy Coutu were playing in their fifth Stanley Cup series.\nRough play marred the series: in the final game, Lionel Hitchman and George Boucher were ejected for a wild fight which Ottawa police had to break up. Hooley Smith butt-ended Boston's Harry Oliver, and Eddie Shore fought with Smith in retaliation; both Smith and Shore were ejected. After the game, Billy Coutu assaulted referee Jerry Laflamme, tackled referee Billy Bell and started a bench-clearing brawl. Coutu was barred from the league for life, Smith was given a one-month suspension effective in the 1927–28 season, while Boucher, Hitchman and Jimmy Herbert were all fined.\nThe April 13, 1927, game at the Ottawa Auditorium was the last Stanley Cup Finals game in Ottawa until the June 2, 2007, game played at Scotiabank Place between the current Senators and the Anaheim Ducks. It is known that one fan, Russell Williams, attended both games, 80 years apart, both games won by Ottawa.\nGame one.\nThe first game ended in a scoreless draw after two ten-minute overtime periods. In the overtime, the condition of the ice became unplayable and NHL President Frank Calder called the game. There were two disallowed goals, one by each team, and both disallowed by off-sides.\nBefore the next game, Calder decided that the series would play to five games if necessary. If after the five games, the teams were tied, that the teams would share the Stanley Cup honours. Calder also ruled that overtimes would be limited to 20 minutes.\nGame two.\nIn the second game, the Senators changed their tactics, going on the offensive. King Clancy and Cy Denneny scored in the first period for Ottawa. The Senators played a defensive game in the second period. In the third period, Harry Oliver scored for the Bruins on a goal-mouth scramble to bring the Bruins within one. In the final minute, with the Bruins pressing, Denneny scored again to put the game beyond doubt.\nGame three.\nThe series switched to Ottawa. The Bruins took the early lead. Jimmy \"Sailor\" Herbert broke in on a pass from Harry Oliver and beat Alex Connell in the Ottawa net at 7:14 of the first period. In the second, the Senators picked up the pace and Denneny scored at 15:15 on a pass from Clancy to tie the score. Neither team could break the tie in the third period or the two overtimes. The result meant that Ottawa could win the series with a win in game four, making game five unnecessary.\nGame four.\nThe Senators decided to start two players who had been substitutes in the previous games, Frank Finnigan and Hec Kilrea and the moves were a success. The Senators came out on the offensive and took a 2–0 lead in the first period on goals by Finnigan and Denneny. Denneny scored again in the third period to put the Senators ahead 3–0. The game degenerated after that. Lionel Hitchman and George Boucher fought, with Eddie Shore jumping in. Ottawa police jumped onto the ice to help the referees and Hitchman and Boucher were ejected. Oliver scored with six minutes to play. Ottawa's Hooley Smith butt-ended Oliver in the face with a minute to play. Shore jumped in to fight Smith and the two were ejected. After the game Coutu attacked referee Laflamme on his way to the dressing room.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1927 Stanley Cup was presented to Senators captain George Boucher by NHL President Frank Calder following the Senators 3–1 win over the Bruins in game four.\nThe following Senators players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\nWith the win Hooley Smith became the fourth player to have won Olympic gold and the Stanley Cup. Smith had won the gold medal at the 1924 Olympics with the Toronto Granites.\n1926–27 Ottawa Senators"

        "text": "Eric Jerome Foster (born March 5, 1985) is an American football defensive tackle who is currently a free agent. He went undrafted in the 2008 NFL Draft. Foster signed a contract with the Indianapolis Colts as an undrafted free agent. He played college football for Rutgers University.\nHigh school career.\nFoster was named All-Dade at linebacker by \"The Miami Herald\" following his senior year at Homestead High School where he led the team to 9-4 season and regional final in state playoffs.\nCollege career.\nAfter redshirting in 2003, Foster made an immediate impact in 2004 as a backup defensive end, playing in all 11 games. Foster was injured during the second game of the 2005 season, only to return in 2006 as the team's starting defensive tackle, lining up to Ramel Meekins. Despite the unit's lack of size, Foster's six sacks helped Rutgers register forty-one sacks total in 2006, good for fifth in all of Division I-A, as well as fourth in total defense.\nFoster gained national notoriety in 2006 for his stellar play, as well as for a popular clip aired by ESPN of a locker room speech. Snippets of the video were played at later home games. In addition, he makes a chopping motion with his arms and hands as a reference to his coach, Greg Schiano's motto, \"Keep Choppin'.\"\nFor his efforts, Foster was named first-team all-Big East Conference. The Football Writers Association of America named him as a first-team All-American at defensive tackle, as well as making Honorable Mention on the AP's team. In 2007, he was named a preseason All-American by \"Sports Illustrated\".\nFoster was named to several pre-season All-America teams for 2007 at DT. He was named to the preseason watch list for the Lott Trophy, annually awarded to the best defensive player in the nation.\nProfessional career.\nIndianapolis Colts.\nAfter going undrafted, Foster was signed as a free agent for the Indianapolis Colts on May 2, 2008. Foster played in 13 games during his first season starting 11 of them.\nDuring the Colts Monday Night Football game against the Buccaneers on October 3, 2011, Foster suffered a gruesome leg injury. During the final minutes of the first half, teammate Tyler Brayton rolled on Foster's ankle, causing his foot to turn painfully the wrong direction. His ankle was dislocated in the process. He was brought to Tampa General Hospital, where he underwent surgery the following day to repair the bone. Foster missed the rest of the 2011-12 season. The incident was compared to Joe Theismann's career-ending injury.\nToronto Argonauts.\nOn June 7, 2013, after sitting out the 2012 season, Foster was signed as a free agent by the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League.\nChicago Bears.\nOn August 17, 2013, Foster was signed by the Chicago Bears.

        "title": "David Price (baseball)",
        "text": "David Taylor Price (born August 26, 1985) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. Price was selected first overall in the 2007 Major League Baseball draft by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut in September 2008. He also played for the Detroit Tigers, Toronto Blue Jays, Boston Red Sox, and Los Angeles Dodgers.\nPrice pitched as a relief pitcher during the Rays' run through the 2008 playoffs. Weeks after his first appearance in the big leagues, he earned a save in Game 7 of the 2008 American League Championship Series (ALCS), helping the Rays reach their first World Series. Price became a full-time starting pitcher in 2009. In his second full season, he was named the American League starter for the 2010 All-Star Game and finished second in the voting for the 2010 Cy Young Award. He won the award in 2012.\nThe Rays traded Price to the Tigers during the 2014 season. When the Tigers fell out of the postseason race in 2015, they traded him to the Blue Jays, who won their division and advanced to the ALCS. That following off-season, the Red Sox signed Price to a franchise-record seven-year, $217 million contract. At the time, it was the largest contract total for a pitcher in Major League history. He won the series-clinching Game 5 as the Red Sox won the 2018 World Series over the Dodgers. The Red Sox traded him to the Dodgers after the 2019 season. He was part of the Los Angeles Dodgers team that won the 2020 World Series, although he did not play a single game after deciding to sit out the COVID-19 pandemic shortened season.\nEarly life.\nDavid Taylor Price was born in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. He has two brothers. He began playing baseball in his early childhood. He grew up as an Atlanta Braves fan and idolized outfielder David Justice. He attended Cooperstown Dreams Park as a teenager, and was a standout on the Blackman High School baseball and basketball teams. In his high school career, he compiled a 0.43 earned run average (ERA) and 151 strikeouts. He received the Rutherford County MVP Pitcher (2003 and 2004), the Co-District 7AAA Pitcher of the Year with Michael Alcorn his senior season, and the Rutherford County Male Athlete of the Year in 2002, 2003 and 2004. He played in the 2004 High School All-America Game in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\nCollege career.\nThough Price was drafted in the 19th round of the 2004 Major League Baseball draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers out of high school, he did not sign, and instead chose to attend Vanderbilt University on an academic scholarship. He pitched for the baseball team for three seasons.\nIn his freshman season in 2005, Price was honored as a Freshman All-American by both \"Baseball America\" and \"Collegiate Baseball\". That year he went 2–4 with a 2.86 ERA in 19 games, compiling 92 strikeouts in innings pitched. Still, frustrated with his college workload, Price almost quit baseball to work at a McDonald's in his hometown but was talked out of it by his coach, Tim Corbin.\nIn 2006, Price posted a 9–5 record with a 4.16 ERA in innings pitched. He set a school single-season record in strikeouts with 155 while walking only 43 batters. In six starts early in the season, he recorded 10 or more strikeouts each game, including a 17-strikeout performance in a game against Arkansas. That year, he was one of five finalists for the Golden Spikes Award and a semifinalist for the Roger Clemens Award. He was also named to the third-team All-American by the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association, first-team All-South Region by the American Baseball Coaches Association and second-team All-SEC by the coaches in that conference.\nAs a junior, he tallied an 11–1 record with a 2.63 ERA. He was the nation's top strikeout pitcher, striking out 194 batters over innings, breaking his own school record. His last start against SEC competition came against Mississippi State in the SEC Baseball Tournament. Price pitched a complete game, going nine innings while giving up five hits, two runs, and striking out 11 batters with no walks. His last start at the college level came against Austin Peay in Vanderbilt's first game in the 2007 Nashville Regional. Against Austin Peay, Price retired 17 batters via the strikeout in nine innings of work while yielding just five hits, one run, and two walks. Price won several major national awards, including college baseball's top honor, the 2007 Dick Howser Trophy, and the 2007 Brooks Wallace Award. David Price was the first player to have a clean sweep of all the college baseball awards.\nUnited States National Team.\nIn the summer of 2005, Price pitched for the United States National Team. He went 2–0 with a 1.26 ERA in five games, tallying 39 strikeouts and 13 walks over innings. On August 2, 2005, he pitched a complete game shutout over Nicaragua, only allowing five hits. In the summer of 2006, Price helped the United States take home the gold medal in the World University Baseball Championship held in Cuba. In eight starts for the United States, Price was 5–1 with a 0.20 ERA.\nProfessional career.\nDraft and minor leagues.\nPrice was drafted with the first-overall pick of the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft. He signed his first professional contract on August 15, 2007. The six-year contract was worth $11.25 million ($8.5 million guaranteed), including a $5.6 million signing bonus. After the contract was approved by MLB, he was added to the Devil Rays 40-man roster before being optioned to the minor leagues to begin his career.\nThe total value of Price's bonus was the largest in draft history. The signing bonus was second-largest in draft history, behind only the $6.1 million Justin Upton received from the Arizona Diamondbacks as the top overall pick in the 2005 MLB draft. The guaranteed value was the third-highest in draft history, trailing only Mark Prior ($10.5 million) and Mark Teixeira ($9.5 million) from the 2001 draft. Price made his spring training debut against the Yankees, hitting the first batter he faced, Francisco Cervelli, and striking out the next three in one inning of work.\nPrice was first assigned to pitch for the Vero Beach Devil Rays of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. He started six games for Vero Beach, compiling a record of 4–0. He had an ERA of 1.82 with 37 strikeouts in innings pitched.\nIn his second start in Vero Beach, Price pitched against Pedro Martínez. After the game, Martínez said of Price:\nAfter moving up through the Rays minor league system to the Montgomery Biscuits of the Class AA Southern League in July, Price was promoted to the Durham Bulls of the Class AAA International League on August 9, 2008. After compiling an 11–0 combined record at Single-A and Double-A, Price received his first professional loss in his first start at Triple-A Durham.\nTampa Bay Rays (2008–2014).\n2008.\nPrice made his major league debut with the Tampa Bay Rays on September 14, 2008, against the Yankees. The first MLB hit he allowed was a home run by New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter; Jeter would later record his 3,000th hit by again homering off Price in 2011. Price pitched innings of relief; he made his first major league start with the Rays on September 22, 2008, against the Baltimore Orioles. He was the winning pitcher in Game 2 of the 2008 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, earning a postseason victory before winning a regular-season game. Price recorded the final four outs in Game 7 of the 2008 ALCS, earning his first career save (regular season or postseason; postseason statistics are recorded separately) and eliminating the defending champion Red Sox. Price then pitched innings in Game 2 of the 2008 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies; he gave up two earned runs but nevertheless earned his second postseason save. The next day, Price introduced Barack Obama at a campaign rally in Tampa.\n2009.\nOn May 30, 2009, Price collected his first major league regular-season win with a 5–2 victory over the Minnesota Twins in which he struck out 11 batters in under 6 innings. He completed the season with a 10–7 record, a 4.42 ERA, 102 strikeouts, and 54 walks in 23 starts.\n2010: Breakout season.\nIn the 2010 season, Price was the first American League pitcher to reach 10 wins, on June 15. On that date, he was 10–2 and led the league with a 2.31 ERA. Price was selected as the American League starting pitcher for the 2010 All-Star Game.\nHe finished the 2010 season tied for second in the American League (with Jon Lester) in wins (19) and in third place in ERA (2.72). He was eighth in the league in strikeouts with 188. He finished second in voting for the AL Cy Young Award behind Félix Hernández.\nHe lost Games 1 and 5 of the 2010 American League Division Series against Cliff Lee and the Texas Rangers.\n2011.\nDuring a game against the Yankees on July 9, 2011, Price allowed a home run to Derek Jeter, which was Jeter's 3,000th career hit. Price finished 2011 with a 12–13 record, 218 strikeouts, and a 3.49 ERA in 34 games started.\n2012: Cy Young Award.\nIn 2012, Price went 20–5 on the season (tying for the league lead in wins) with a league-leading 2.54 ERA. Price pitched a complete-game shutout against the Los Angeles Angels on April 24, 2012, with the final score 5–0. Price pitched in the 2012 MLB All-Star Game. Price got his 20th win against the Chicago White Sox on September 30, making him the first 20-win pitcher in Rays franchise history. In recording the win, he became the youngest American League pitcher (aged 27) to earn 20 wins in a season since 2004. Price won the AL Cy Young Award after a tight race.\n2013.\nIn 2013, Price went 10–8 on the season with a 3.33 ERA, and had an American League-leading and career-best four complete games. In the 2013 American League Wild Card tie-breaker against the Texas Rangers, Price pitched a complete game to lead the Rays into the postseason.\n2014.\nFrom June 4 to 25, Price had five consecutive starts with at least ten strikeouts, becoming only the eighth pitcher in major league history to do so.\nOn July 6, Price was named to his fourth All-Star team; he did not participate in this All-Star game due to pitching in a game two days prior, avoiding pitching on only one day of rest. He was replaced by Fernando Rodney.\nBefore a July 31 trade to the Detroit Tigers, Price had a record of 11–8, with a 3.11 ERA, 189 strikeouts, and 23 walks in 23 starts with the Rays.\nDetroit Tigers (2014–2015).\n2014: MLB Strikeouts leader.\nOn July 31, Price was traded to the Detroit Tigers in a three-team deal that sent Drew Smyly, Nick Franklin and Willy Adames to the Tampa Bay Rays, and Austin Jackson to the Seattle Mariners. In his Tigers debut against the New York Yankees on August 5, Price pitched innings, allowing three runs, striking out ten, and walking none.\nOn August 21, in his first game against his former team, the Tampa Bay Rays, Price allowed one hit and an unearned run with one out in the first inning, then retired the final 23 batters he faced, but suffered a complete game loss. Price is the first pitcher in the major leagues to lose a complete game, one-hitter or better, with no earned runs since Andy Hawkins lost a no-hitter for the New York Yankees on July 1, 1990. It was the first time since 1914 that a pitcher has lost a complete game, one-hit, no walk start without allowing an earned run.\nOn August 27, in a game against the Yankees, Price allowed eight runs and twelve hits, including nine straight in the third inning of an 8–4 loss. He is the first pitcher since Bob Forsch in 1989 to allow nine straight hits. Only three previous times in major league history had a pitcher allowed 12 hits in two innings or fewer, the others being Shawn Estes in 2003, Johnny Podres in 1963 and George Uhle in 1929.\nWith the Tigers, Price went 4–4 over the final two months of the season, with a 3.59 ERA and 82 strikeouts in innings. On September 28, the last day of the regular season, Price pitched shutout innings against the Minnesota Twins, giving up four hits, striking out eight, and earning the 3–0 win, to help the Tigers clinch their fourth consecutive AL Central Division title.\nPrice finished the 2014 regular season with a 15–12 record, 3.26 ERA and 1.08 WHIP. He led all of major league baseball in innings pitched (), batters faced (1,009) and strikeouts (271).\n2015 season: AL ERA leader.\nOn January 16, 2015, Price and the Tigers avoided arbitration agreeing on a $19.75 million salary for the 2015 season, setting a record for the largest one-year deal for an arbitration-eligible player prior to free agency. Price was named the Tigers opening day starter for 2015 by manager Brad Ausmus, ending teammate Justin Verlander's streak of seven consecutive opening day starts. He responded by pitching shutout innings in the Tigers 4–0 win over the Minnesota Twins.\nOn July 6, 2015, Price was named to the 2015 All-Star Game, his fifth such honor. Price pitched a scoreless fourth inning in the game, striking out two, and earning the win for the AL. He entered the All-Star Break with a 9–2 record, 2.38 ERA and 115 strikeouts.\nToronto Blue Jays (2015).\n2015.\nOn July 30, 2015, Price was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for Daniel Norris, Matt Boyd and Jairo Labourt. Price made his debut for the Blue Jays on August 3. He threw 119 pitches in 8 innings, recording 11 strikeouts and a winning decision, while yielding only 3 hits, 2 walks, and 1 earned run in a 5–1 victory over the Minnesota Twins at Rogers Centre. His 11 strikeouts tied José Núñez's team record for most strikeouts in a Blue Jays' pitching debut. On September 5, Price earned his 100th career win, by beating the Baltimore Orioles 5–1. He was scratched from his final start of the season on October 1, as the Blue Jays had clinched the AL East the previous day. Price made 11 starts for the Blue Jays in 2015, and went 9–1 with a 2.30 ERA and 87 strikeouts in innings. Price started Game 1 of the ALDS for the Blue Jays, taking the loss and bringing his career postseason record to 1–6. He would earn his second career postseason win on October 12, pitching 3 innings in relief of R. A. Dickey's game 4 start.\nPrice finished the 2015 season with an 18–5 record and a 2.45 ERA. Price finished second in Cy Young Award balloting to Dallas Keuchel.\nBoston Red Sox (2016–2019).\n2016.\nOn December 4, 2015, Price signed a seven-year, $217 million contract with the Boston Red Sox, a franchise record. Price recorded a win in his debut with the Red Sox on April 5, 2016. Price's first season was markedly different from the first to second half. In his first 18 starts, Price compiled an 8–6 record with a 4.64 ERA. He finished the season at 3.99 ERA with a 17–9 record. He led the AL with 230 innings pitched and 227 hits allowed. His 228 strikeouts also marked the second-highest in his career, after his 2014 season split between Tampa and Detroit. Additionally, he was the first pitcher to start 35 games since Chris Carpenter in 2010.\n2017.\nPrice started the season on the 10-day disabled list with an elbow injury suffered in spring training. Price was activated on Monday, May 29, 2017, and made his debut against the Chicago White Sox that afternoon.\nOn June 29, Price was involved in a verbal altercation with NESN broadcaster and Hall of Fame pitcher Dennis Eckersley on the team's plane; Eckersley had criticized a poor performance by teammate Eduardo Rodríguez, prompting Price to yell, \"Here he is — the greatest pitcher who ever lived! This game is easy for him!’’ at Eckersley, before doubling down with numerous repetitions of \"Get the fuck out of here!\" to the applause of several Red Sox players. Price was criticized for his berating of Eckersley, as well as his refusal to apologize, by both the media and fans.\nOn July 28, Price was again placed on the 10-day disabled list due to left elbow inflammation. He returned to the Red Sox on September 14 and was used from a reliever role for the rest of the season. In the 2017 American League Division Series against the Houston Astros, Price pitched scoreless innings, including four innings in Game 3. The Red Sox would go on to lose the series, 3–1.\n2018: World Series champion.\nDuring spring training prior to the 2018 season, Price said he wished he had handled the situation with Eckersley differently and said he knew he could win the fans back by pitching well. \"If I go out pitch the way I'm capable of pitching, they won't care,\" he said. Price returned to the rotation to start the 2018 season and threw 14 scoreless innings in his first two starts, exiting the second one to a standing ovation from the crowd at Fenway Park. \"When he's healthy, he's one of the best pitchers in the league,\" said Red Sox manager Alex Cora of Price after the game. On May 9, Price was scratched from a scheduled start against the Yankees due to a mild case of carpal tunnel syndrome. During the 2018 regular season, Price made 30 appearances (all starts) with a 16–7 record, 3.58 ERA, and 177 strikeouts in 176 innings.\nIn the postseason, Price started Game 2 of the Division Series against the New York Yankees. He allowed three runs on three hits and was removed after innings, taking the loss. This was the tenth postseason game that Price had started during his career, all ten of which had resulted in losses for his teams. Price's next postseason start was Game 2 of the Championship Series against the Houston Astros, which the Red Sox won, 7–5, with Price allowing four runs, five hits, and four walks in innings; he received a no decision as he did not complete the fifth inning. When Chris Sale became unavailable to start Game 5 of that series for health reasons, Price was called on to start again on only three days' rest, and earned the win, holding Houston scoreless through six innings while allowing just three hits and striking out nine. Winning 4–1, the Red Sox clinched their first trip to the World Series since 2013. It was Price's first win in 12 career postseason starts, and his third postseason win overall; the two earlier wins had been earned in relief during the 2008 ALCS and 2015 ALDS.\nPrice next started Game 2 of the World Series, holding the Dodgers to two runs on three hits and three walks in six innings while striking out five, and earning the win in a 4–2 Boston victory. Price also pitched scoreless relief in Game 3 and warmed up in the bullpen for Game 4. Although ace Chris Sale was available on full rest (albeit with a shoulder injury), Price started Game 5, with Alex Cora reasoning that a National League park could require a pinch hitter that would cause him to remove his starter early. Price surrendered a home run to David Freese on his first pitch, but then retired 14 batters in a row. He was relieved in the eighth inning with Boston leading, 5–1; Joe Kelly and Sale got the final six outs to clinch the World Series victory.\nOn October 31, prior to the Red Sox victory parade, Price announced that he would not exercise an opt-out clause in his contract, saying that he wants to win in Boston; \"We did that this year, and I want to do it again.\" In early November, the New York City chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) announced Price as the Babe Ruth Award recipient, honoring MLB player with the best performance in the postseason. Later in November, Price was announced as the AL Comeback Player of the Year.\n2019.\nPrior to the season, Price announced that he was changing his uniform number from 24 to 10, a tribute to his son Xavier, since \"X\" represents the Roman numeral ten. Price began the season as a member of the starting rotation, pitching to a 1–2 record with 3.75 ERA in six starts, until being placed on the injured list on May 6, retroactive to May 3, due to left elbow tendinitis. He was activated on May 20, starting and getting the win in a game against Toronto. From May 20 to July 7, Price won 6 straight decisions. Price was briefly on the paternity list in early August, as his wife gave birth to their second child; at the time, he had a 7–4 record with 3.86 ERA in 20 starts, with 123 strikeouts in innings. Price was placed on the injured list on August 8, retroactive to August 5, due to a left wrist triangular fibrocartilage (TFCC) cyst. He was activated from the injured list on September 1. He pitched that day, then was held out of the rotation due to additional concern about his wrist. He did not pitch again during the season, finishing with 22 appearances (all starts), recording 128 strikeouts in innings and a 7–5 record with a 4.28 ERA.\nLos Angeles Dodgers (2021–2022).\nOn February 10, 2020, the Red Sox traded Price, Mookie Betts, and cash consideration to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for Alex Verdugo, Connor Wong and Jeter Downs. In May 2020, Price announced he would donate $1,000 to each of the Dodgers minor league players in an effort to help offset their costs during the COVID-19 pandemic. On July 4, 2020, Price announced that he would not play during the shortened 2020 season amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The Dodgers went on to win the 2020 World Series and the team gave Price a World Series ring, despite not playing a single game for the team that season. Price auctioned his ring off in order to help raise money for The Players Alliance.\n2021.\nOn April 15, 2021, Price picked up his first big league save against the Colorado Rockies. On May 27, Price struck out his former teammate and fellow Vanderbilt alum Curt Casali of the San Francisco Giants for his 2,000th career strikeout. Price pitched in 39 games for the Dodgers in the 2021 season, which included 11 starts, and finished 5–2 with a 4.03 ERA. Price was active for the NLDS but did not appear in a game, then was left off the roster for the NLCS but was added for Game 6 after an injury to Joe Kelly, but he did not appear in that series either.\n2022.\nIn early September, Price was placed on the injured list following 38 appearances in the 2022 season, all of them out of the bullpen. During an interview with \"USA Today's\" Bob Nightengale, Price said he was considering retirement following the 2022 season. \"It's just time,\" he said. \"Everything on my body hurts.\" As news of his potential retirement spread, Price clarified to news outlets that he had not made a final decision on the timing of his retirement and that he planned to return to pitching in time for the postseason. He would pitch out of the bullpen in 2 more games that season, in late September. It was the first season in his career where he had not started any games. He allowed 11 runs in innings for a 2.45 ERA, and did not pitch in the postseason.\nOn December 5, 2022, Price announced that he would not pitch in MLB during the 2023 season.\nScouting report.\nPrice uses a wide variety of pitches and complements them with excellent velocity. He throws two fastballs in the range, topping out at ; a four-seamer and a two-seamer. His two-seamer is his lead pitch against right-handed and left-handed hitters, although he uses it more often against lefties. Price also throws a cutter at , used mainly against right-handed hitters (especially in two-strike counts). He rounds out his repertoire with a changeup he uses mainly against right-handed hitters, but also features to left-handed hitters, at , and a spike curveball at .\nPrice tends to set the pace early in games, taking 5–7 seconds to pitch the ball after it is returned by the catcher.\nPrice's style of pitching has resulted in what some call the \"Price rule\", which makes a pitcher specify whether he is working from a set position (often called the stretch) or a full windup position when a runner is on third.\nPersonal life.\nPrice married longtime girlfriend Tiffany Smith in November 2016. The couple's first child was born in May 2017. Their second child was born in August 2019. They own property in Naples, Florida, Nashville, Tennessee, and Paradise Valley, Arizona.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

This was the sixth edition of the games, which are held every four years and run by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI). For the first time, Para-equestrian events were added in the program. This was also the first time the games were hosted by a city outside of Europe, and also the first time that all events at the games were held at a single site. (Although the 100-mile/161-km endurance course, by necessity, was mostly contained outside the park, the main veterinary gate was located within the park.)\nAlltech, an animal health and nutrition company located in Nicholasville, Kentucky (about 15 minutes from downtown Lexington and 30 minutes from the Horse Park), was the title sponsor of the 2010 Games. The sponsorship was valued at $10 million. However, Alltech's total support went far beyond the name sponsorship package. The company had nearly 60 employees involved with the promotion of the Games—more than the size of the official FEI World Games staff. When the organizing committee for the Games announced a budget cutback due to lower-than-expected ticket sales, Alltech stepped up its financial support. Company founder and president Pearse Lyons also brought in University of Kentucky basketball head coach John Calipari to promote a special luxury ticket package. At the time of the Games, the company's support was estimated to have been $32 million, and the company was expected to (and ultimately did) sponsor the next edition of the Games held in the French region of Normandy in 2014.\nSchedule.\nAll times are US EDT (UTC-4)\n18 events were contested over 8 disciplines. Para Dressage was included for the first time.\nOfficials.\nAppointment of (Olympic disciplines) officials was as follows:\nParticipating nations.\n58 countries were represented at the games."

        "text": "The 2004 State of Origin series was the 23rd time that the annual three-game series between the Queensland and New South Wales representative rugby league football teams was contested entirely under 'state of origin' selection rules.\nA pre-series Blues mobile phone scandal, Brad Fittler's comeback, a Golden point outcome in Game I and an extraordinary Billy Slater try showed that State of Origin's ability to create memorable football moments was as strong as ever after 25 years of the concept. The New South Wales' Game III victory saw a match-up in the respective cumulative tallies at 35 wins apiece, continuing a recurring trend where any push toward dominance by one side is soon countered by the other. The Ron McAuliffe Medal for Queensland player of the series was awarded to Steve Price.\nGame I.\nNew South Wales players Anthony Minichiello and Mark Gasnier were dropped following a drunken incident during the Blues' training camp when it was made public that Gasnier had left a lewd message on a female acquaintance's phone.\nGame one featured the first ever Golden point decision in State of Origin football in the very first game where the ruling became available. With scores locked at 8-all and three minutes of extra time played, St George Illawarra Dragons player Shaun Timmins, who had returned to top-class and representative football against unlikely odds after two career-threatening knee injuries and operations, stepped up and kicked a 37-metre left-foot field goal to steal victory for New South Wales. Blues halfback Craig Gower had already missed three earlier field goal attempts, was struggling with a knee injury and was closely marked by Queensland at every kick opportunity so it was left to Timmins to create his own moment of Origin folklore.\nGame II.\nGame II had plenty of hype surrounding it after Blues coach Phil Gould coaxed Brad Fittler out of representative retirement to spearhead the Blues campaign. First game hero Timmins was missing through injury as was Gower and next choice half-backs Trent Barrett and Brett Kimmorley. This left Sydney Roosters number seven Brett Finch to make his Origin debut alongside his club captain Fittler at five-eighth.\nSuncorp Stadium proved to be a graveyard for the Blues thanks to one of the greatest Origin tries ever seen. 20-year-old Billy Slater, a former track work jockey who had burst onto the rugby league scene in 2003, stormed onto a Darren Lockyer grubber kick from halfway before chipping over the top of Blues fullback Anthony Minichiello, chasing, regathering and scoring in the same instant.\nGame III.\nGould gambled by making six changes to the side which had played in game II. \nIn Game III, the Blues recalled Trent Barrett to the origin squad who along with Brad Fittler led the Blues to a big win over the Maroons. The match was also the swansong for Phil Gould, New South Wales' most successful Origin coach who had commenced his coaching association with Fittler 14 years earlier at the beginning of their respective coaching and playing careers.\nGould called on six St George Illawarra players for Game III. Debutant centres Mark Gasnier and Matt Cooper dominated on the fringes for the Blues and the class of Fittler and Barrett led them to an emphatic 36-14 victory. Fittler scored the last try in the match in his last ever match for the Blues to the delight of his team-mates."

He later was named the Senators' vice president and treasurer, and was retained when Bob Short purchased the Senators in 1968. He accompanied the franchise to Dallas-Fort Worth when it relocated after the season and became the Rangers' general manager in their first season in North Texas. After two years in that role, Burke moved to the Royals as business manager after the campaign.\nIn June 1974, Burke became the second general manager in the Royals' six-year history. One of his first major moves was the hiring of Whitey Herzog as manager during the middle of the 1975 season on July 25. Herzog would be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame as a manager in 2010, but he had failed dismally as the Rangers' pilot, working under Burke, during 1973. In Kansas City, he would turn the Royals into consistent contenders in the AL West. Burke also appointed Jim Frey and Dick Howser as managers after Herzog's exit, and each man would lead Kansas City to an American League pennant (and, in Howser's case, the 1985 World Series title as well).\nBurke became the Royals' second club president after the 1981 season, succeeding owner Ewing Kauffman, and his top assistant, John Schuerholz, was promoted to general manager. Like Herzog, Schuerholz would also be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame (in 2017, for his later success as GM of the Atlanta Braves).\nBurke died of lymphatic cancer in Kansas City, Kansas, at age 68."

He threw and batted left-handed and was listed as tall and .\nBorn in Sarasota, Florida, Hale attended Lake View High School in Chicago, and was signed by the St. Louis Browns before the season. In the minor leagues, Hale showed promise in when he had a batting average of .332 with 30 doubles and had 100 RBI at Aberdeen of the Northern League. The following season, , Hale starred as a member of the York White Roses, leading the Class B Piedmont League in doubles with 35. He also hit ten triples, 12 home runs, and drove in 101 runs in 142 games. Hale continued his offensive tear in the Piedmont circuit with York in , hitting .355 with 12 triples and 65 RBI in just 61 games before being called up to the majors by the Baltimore Orioles.\nHale made his MLB debut with the Orioles on July 4, 1955, with a single in four at bats against the Washington Senators, and would go on to have a very successful first year, batting .357 in 67 games played. He followed that up in with a career-high 85 games played, but managed only a .237 batting average. After parts of three more seasons where he played sparingly for the Orioles and spent time in the top levels of the minors, Hale was placed on waivers and picked by the Cleveland Indians for the season. He got into 70 games for Cleveland in 1960, almost exclusively as a pinch hitter, and batted .300 with 12 RBI. But in , his effectiveness diminished and he was hitting only .167 in pinch hitting roles when he was purchased by the New York Yankees on July 28. As a pinch hitter for the Yankees who started one game at first base (on September 21), Hale went 2-for-13 and played his final MLB game on October 1, the game in which Roger Maris set his single-season home run mark. Hale singled in his last at bat off Tracy Stallard of the Boston Red Sox, the hurler who surrendered Maris' blow.\nHale did not appear in the 1961 World Series, won by New York in five games, and played 1962 at Triple-A Richmond before leaving the game.\nIn 376 MLB games played, Hale registered 171 hits, with 29 doubles, two triples and two homers. He batted .273 lifetime with 89 runs batted in."

He was born in Newport News, Virginia.\nCareer.\nMontague attended Newport News High School and played college baseball at Old Dominion University, was selected by the Chicago White Sox in the 15th round of the 1965 Major League Baseball Draft, but decided not to sign with the team. He was then selected by the Baltimore Orioles in the 3rd round of the 1967 amateur draft. On April 13, 1973, the Orioles sent him to the Montreal Expos in exchange for Mickey Scott.\nHe made his major league debut for the Expos on September 9, 1973, against the New York Mets, pitching the eighth inning of a game the Expos lost by a score of 3–0, and retiring all three batters he faced. He was with the Expos for two full seasons, with no decisions in the season in four relief appearances, and ending the with a 3–4 record and 3 saves in 46 appearances, including one start.

        "text": "The 1979 Daytona 500, the 21st annual running of the event, was the second race of the 1979 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season. It was held on February 18, 1979 at Daytona International Speedway, in Daytona Beach, Florida. Sports pundits Donnie Allison and Cale Yarborough regard the 1979 Daytona 500 as the most important race in stock car history.\nThe race was televised live \"flag-to-flag\", a rarity in the era, and the first for a 500-mile race in the United States. Camera angles such as the \"in-car\" view were introduced to viewers from all over the United States.\nOn the final lap, race leaders Cale Yarborough and Donnie Allison collided with each other on the backstretch. Both drivers' races ended in the grass infield. The wreck allowed Richard Petty, at the time of the crash over one-half lap behind the leaders, to claim his sixth Daytona 500 win.\nAs Petty made his way to Victory Lane to celebrate, a fight erupted between Yarborough, Donnie Allison and his brother, Bobby, at the site of the backstretch wreck. Both events were caught by television cameras and broadcast live.\nThe race brought national publicity to NASCAR. Due to a large winter storm, parts of the Midwest and most of the Northeastern United States were snowed in, leaving a very sizable audience to watch the race who were not traditionally part of NASCAR's demographic, which largely drew from Southeastern states. Motorsports announcer and editor Dick Berggren said, \"Nobody knew it then, but that was the race that got everything going. It was the first 'water cooler' race, the first time people had stood around water coolers on Monday and talked about seeing a race on TV the day before. It took a while – years, maybe – to realize how important it was.\" Chip Warren was Chief Starter, according to CBS's Ken Squier.\nTelevision.\nThe 1979 Daytona 500 was the first 500-mile race to be broadcast in its entirety live on national television in the United States. Races were shown on television, but the Indianapolis 500, for example, was broadcast on tape delay later in the evening on the day it was run in this era and usually in edited form. Most races aired during this period were only broadcast starting with the final quarter to half of the race, as was the procedure for ABC's IndyCar broadcasts on their \"Wide World of Sports\" program.\nCBS signed a new contract with NASCAR to telecast the race. Ken Squier and David Hobbs were the booth announcers with Ned Jarrett and Brock Yates in the pits for that race, while other angles, such as an interview with race grand marshall Ben Gazzara and NASCAR founder Bill France, Sr., were handled by Marianne Bunch-Phelps. The day was fortunate for CBS as a major snowstorm known as the Presidents Day Snowstorm of 1979 bogged down most of the Northeast and parts of the Midwestern United States, increasing the viewership of the event. The race introduced two new innovative uses of TV cameras, the \"in-car\" camera and the low angle \"speed shot\", which are now considered standard in all telecasts of auto racing.\nThe race attracted a TV rating of 10.5 and attracted 16 million viewers. It held the highest television rating for a Daytona 500 until the 2002 Daytona 500.\nMotor Racing Network broadcast the race on the radio and their announcers included Jack Arute, Barney Hall, Mike Joy, Gary Gerould (who also hosted prerace ceremonies) and Dick Berggren.\nQualifying.\nBuddy Baker and Donnie Allison qualified first and second and were the only drivers to do so, as only two cars qualify from time trials. All other drivers had to race their way through qualifying races.\nBaker won his first qualifying race, with Cale Yarborough, Benny Parsons, Bobby Allison and David Pearson finishing in the top five, with positions 2-5 starting on the inside of rows 2-5, respectively.\nIn the second qualifying race, pole-sitter Donnie Allison had an engine failure (no penalty for failed engines in the qualifying race until 2018) midway through the race. Darrell Waltrip won the second qualifying race to start fourth. The rest of the cars starting on the outside of rows 3-5 were A. J. Foyt, Dick Brooks and rookie Dale Earnhardt, Sr. making his Daytona 500 debut.\nNotable drivers who failed to advance from qualifying races or speed included USAC star Jim Hurtubise, French sports car ace Claude Ballot-Lena, Cup race winners James Hylton, Morgan Shepherd and future NASCAR Hall of Fame driver Bill Elliott.\nRace.\nThe first 15 laps of the 200-lap race were run under green and yellow flag conditions to help dry the track from rain the previous night. This impacted Waltrip, as running at relatively slow speeds on the high banks of the track caused a lack of oil to lubricate his camshaft, resulting in a cam lobe wearing away prematurely and causing his engine to run on seven cylinders for the rest of the race.\nOn the start of lap 16 (the first green flag lap), pole-sitter Baker lost the draft and fell back. Donnie Allison raced with Yarborough and Bobby Allison, but lost control of his car on lap 31 and forced Yarborough and Bobby Allison to take evasive action. All three cars spun through the backstretch infield, which was slippery and muddy from the rain. Yarborough was forced to repair his car and fell two laps behind the leader, as did Bobby Allison, while Donnie Allison lost one lap. The track would remain under caution through lap 41.\nWhile the field was still under caution on lap 38, Baker dropped out of the race with ignition problems. His team had made some minor welding repairs before the race and it was thought the primary ignition control box had been damaged as the engine was misfiring. During attempts to diagnose and repair the problem, the team switched to the backup box and replaced much of the ignition system to no avail. When the team returned home after the race, engine builder Waddell Wilson determined that the crewman who had switched to the backup box by unplugging the primary ignition box and plugging into the backup box had plugged back into the defective primary box. When Wilson switched to the backup ignition box, the car fired perfectly.\nWhen the caution ended on lap 42, the race became an 18-car battle. Neil Bonnett, driving an Oldsmobile, took the lead and was challenged by Foyt and Waltrip; he fought them off, but was soon challenged by Bobby Allison trying to unlap himself, Earnhardt and dark-horse driver Tighe Scott, driving a Buick Century prepared by Harry Hyde. A six-car crash on lap 53 eliminated Pearson and others. Donnie Allison raced to unlap himself and made his lap up when Bonnett blew a tire and spun in traffic. Other contenders were eliminated, as Bobby Allison fell multiple laps behind, Harry Gant crashed, Earnhardt over-revved his engine leaving the pits and broke a rocker arm and valve spring, Parsons' car overheated and Scott slid through his pits unable to stop when he hit a puddle of water from Parsons' overheating engine. Past the halfway point, Donnie Allison assumed the lead, but Yarborough used more caution flags to make up his lost laps. Yarborough was on the lead lap with Allison by lap 178.\nFinish.\nFollowing green flag stops, Donnie Allison took the lead on lap 178 with Yarborough close behind. They pulled away during the final laps and led the next closest competitors by half a lap. Allison took the white flag and was leading the race on the final lap with Yarborough drafting him tightly. As Yarborough attempted a slingshot pass on the backstretch, Allison attempted to block him. Yarborough refused to give ground and as he pulled alongside Allison, his left side tires left the pavement and went into the wet and muddy infield grass. Yarborough lost control of his car and contacted Allison's car halfway down the backstretch. As both drivers tried to maintain control, their cars made contact three more times before locking together and crashing into the outside wall in turn three. The cars slid down the banking and came to rest in the infield. Richard Petty, who was over half a lap behind both drivers before the incident, went on to win, beating Waltrip by one car length.\nAfter the wrecked cars of Allison and Yarborough settled in the infield grass short of the finish line, the two drivers began to argue. Bobby Allison, who was one lap down at that point, stopped where the wreck was, offering Donnie Allison a ride back to the garage. Yarborough blamed Bobby for his defeat due to tensions they had with each other earlier during the race. He struck Bobby in the face with his helmet while Bobby was sitting in his car. Fuming, Bobby jumped out of his car and struck Yarborough in the mouth.\nYarborough knocked Bobby to the ground and struck him in the back with his helmet twice. Donnie Allison grabbed Yarborough from behind, shouting, \"Hey!! You wanna fight?! I'm the cat you should be fighting with!\" Donnie pulled Yarborough away from Bobby, who jumped up and threw a punch at Yarborough. Bobby grabbed Yarborough by the collar with one arm, shaking him as Yarborough tried to shove him away with his foot and kicking at him. Donnie also held on to Yarborough's arm and swung his helmet trying to defend his brother. A track safety official grabbed Yarborough, trying to pry him away from the Allisons. Yarborough fell to the ground and Bobby jumped on him, hitting him twice in the nose. More track marshalls arrived and restrained all three drivers, separating them after the 16-second brawl.\nWith Allison and Yarborough wrecking near the end of the last lap, the television audience was mostly shown footage of Petty crossing the finish line to win the race. Brief moments of the fight were seen on national television when the commentators and camera operators realized what was going on and switched to the scene.\nYarborough said, \"I was going to pass him and win the race, but he turned left and crashed me. So, hell, I crashed him back. If I wasn't going to get back around, he wasn't either.\" Allison said, \"The track was mine until he hit me in the back,\" he says. \"He got me loose and sideways, so I came back to get what was mine. He wrecked me, I didn't wreck him.\"\nIn the aftermath, both Allison brothers and Yarborough were fined $6,000 for actions detrimental to stock car racing. Although all three of them were penalized, the Allisons were put on probation for six months as the incident was judged to have been instigated by them. As per the penalty, the Allisons and Yarborough had to post a $5,000 bond which would be returned over the next several races provided good behavior. Both Bobby and Donnie appealed the penalty, arguing that they weren't the cause of the accident. On appeal, the Allisons' probation periods concluded in three months, and Yarborough was put on probation for three months. The initial judgment that the wreck was Allison's fault was amended to place blame equally on both Allison and Yarborough. $5,000 of their $6,000 fines were returned $1000 at a time over the next five races.\nThe story made the front page of \"The New York Times\" Sports section. NASCAR had arrived as a national sport and began to expand from its southeastern United States base and become a national sport, shedding its moonshine running roots along the way.\nPlay-by-play of the final lap.\n\"(The following is an excerpt from the CBS television coverage of the race)\"\nDavid Hobbs: \"The white flag is out, one lap to go.

        "text": "The 2000 Daytona 500 was the first stock car race of the 2000 NASCAR Winston Cup Series, the first of five No Bull 5 races, and the 42nd iteration of the event. The race was held on Sunday, February 20, 2000, before an audience of 200,000 in Daytona Beach, Florida at Daytona International Speedway, a 2.5 miles (4.0 km) permanent triangular-shaped superspeedway. The race took the scheduled 200 laps to complete.\nIn the final laps of the race, Robert Yates Racing's Dale Jarrett engaged in a battle for the lead against Tyler Jet Motorsports' Johnny Benson Jr. With four laps left in the race, Jarrett was able to pass Benson, retaining the lead until a caution came out with two laps left in the race for Jimmy Spencer. As the race ended under caution, Jarrett was the declared the winner at race's end. The victory was Jarrett's 23rd career NASCAR Winston Cup Series victory, his first victory of the season, and his third and final Daytona 500 victory. To fill out the top three, Roush Racing's Jeff Burton and owner-driver Bill Elliott finished second and third, respectively.\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is one of three superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the other two being Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway. The standard track at Daytona International Speedway is a four-turn superspeedway that is 2.5 miles (4.0 km) long. The track's turns are banked at 31 degrees, while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, is banked at 18 degrees.\nAfter years of complaints over suspension issues first exposed after two fatal crashes in 1994 regarding overaggressive shock and spring setups, NASCAR decided for the \"restrictor plate\" races to implement standardised shocks and springs.\nPractice.\nFirst practice.\nThe first practice session was held on Friday, February 11, at 10:00 AM EST. The session lasted for two hours. Penske-Kranefuss Racing's Rusty Wallace set the fastest time in the session, with a lap of 47.555 and an average speed of .\nSecond practice.\nThe second practice session was held on Friday, February 11, at 12:30 PM EST.

Jarrett was, however, able to save the car and continue using the car for the Daytona 500.\nQualifying.\nQualifying was set by the 2000 Gatorade 125s. The top two positions were set by qualifying speeds held for the Gatorade 125s held on Saturday, February 12, with the top two qualifiers in the session earning the top two positions for the Daytona 500. The rest of the starting lineup was set in the Gatorade 125s held on Thursday, February 17, during two races. The top 14 finishers in the first race, excluding the pole position winner, set the inside row from rows two to 15, and the top 14 finishers in the second race, excluding the outside pole position winner, set the outside row from rows two to 15. The remaining non-qualifiers set positions 31-36 based on qualifying speeds from the first qualifying session held on Saturday. In addition, six provisionals based on the previous season's owner's points were given out, setting positions 37-42. The final position, position 43, was given to a past series champion who did not otherwise qualify by any other method. If no past champion needed the provisional, the position was given out to the next team in the previous season's owner's points.\nDale Jarrett, driving for Robert Yates Racing, managed to win the pole, setting a time of 47.098 and an average speed of in Saturday's session.\n13 drivers failed to qualify."

        "text": "The 1996 Daytona 500, the 38th running of the event, was ran on February 18, 1996, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida, as the first race of the 1996 NASCAR Winston Cup season. Dale Jarrett won this race for the second time after winning it in 1993 and for the first (and only) time in all of Daytona 500 history, Dale Earnhardt won the pole position, allowing many to believe that he would finally win the race. Ernie Irvan returned to race full-time alongside Earnhardt (both drivers won their respective Gatorade Twin 125-mile qualifying races).\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is a race track in Daytona Beach, Florida, that is one of six superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the others being Michigan International Speedway, Auto Club Speedway, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Pocono Raceway, and Talladega Superspeedway. The standard track at Daytona is a four-turn superspeedway that is long. The track also features two other layouts that utilize portions of the primary high speed tri-oval, such as a sports car course and a motorcycle course. The track's infield includes the Lake Lloyd, which has hosted powerboat racing. The speedway is owned and operated by International Speedway Corporation.\nThe track was built by NASCAR founder Bill France, Sr. to host racing that was being held at the former Daytona Beach Road Course and opened with the first Daytona 500 in 1959. The Daytona 500 is regarded as the most important and prestigious race on the NASCAR calendar. It is also the series' first race of the year; this phenomenon is virtually unique in sports, which tend to have championships or other major events at the end of the season rather than the start.\nRace summary.\nOpening laps.\nThe lead changed four times between Ernie Irvan, Ken Schrader, Sterling Marlin, and Dale Earnhardt in the first five laps. \nReigning Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon was eliminated on lap 8 after getting a light tap from Jeremy Mayfield. Busch Series Goody's 300 winner Steve Grissom, along with Joe Nemechek (both Busch Series champions), Rick Mast, and Rusty Wallace, were involved in a chain reaction incident after Gordon hit the wall. Mast's and Wallace's cars both were relatively undamaged, but Grissom and Nemechek lost several laps after repairs. On lap 29, Earnhardt's ignition failed, triggering a wreck for Ernie Irvan. Wally Dallenbach Jr., who could not see Earnhardt, tagged Irvan and sent him into the wall.\nDue to a new rules package, the lead changed hands early and often. On lap 50, no one but Dale Earnhardt or Terry Labonte (the new leader) had spent more than 4 consecutive laps in the lead. Lap 54 saw 1990 race winner Derrike Cope hit the turn 4 wall, which ended his day.\nMid-race developments.\nOn lap 77, 1994 and 1995 winner Sterling Marlin took the lead away from Terry Labonte and led three laps before having engine problems. Not much later, Labonte began to drop back with overheating issues after leading the most laps at 44. He managed a decent finish, but Marlin almost instantly retired from the lead. IndyCar veteran John Andretti, whose uncle Mario won the 1967 race, became the new leader. He and Earnhardt, along with Bill Elliott, Dale Jarrett, Ken Schrader and Michael Waltrip, were all prime contenders at halfway. The field made green flag pit stops over the next 10 laps. Andretti came in for another pit stop immediately after his scheduled stop because not all of the right rear lugnuts had been tightened. On lap 131, while trying to get his lap back, he had a hard crash in turn 2. Waltrip clipped him as he tried to go past his spinning car, only to damage the right-front fender. The damage seemed to improve the car's aerodynamic qualities. Shortly after the restart, Mike Wallace suddenly snapped loose and collected Loy Allen Jr., Brett Bodine and Bobby Labonte, whose car was relatively undamaged. Only Wallace; Allen Jr.; and Bodine were all done for the day.\nRun to the finish.\nGeoff Bodine and Lake Speed crashed at lap 159, collecting Bobby Hamilton, Chad Little, Robert Pressley, Jeff Purvis and Morgan Shepherd. This prompted the final pit stops. Dale Jarrett and his crew chief Todd Parrott decided on a four-tire change, while the RCR duo of Earnhardt and David Smith opted for two. Bud Moore, whose car and driver Wally Dallenbach Jr. were not yet sponsored for the season, were going to gamble that their full tank of fuel from the previous caution would be enough to finish. Even so, Dallenbach kept the #15 in the lead pack in the waning laps. Earnhardt quickly dispatched new leader and last year's Rookie of the Year Ricky Craven. He lost the lead briefly to Schrader but at lap 177, Jarrett passed him with four fresh tires. Earnhardt could keep up with Jarrett, but he could not repass him. This would allow Jarrett to win his second Daytona 500 win, followed by Earnhardt, Schrader, Mark Martin and Jeff Burton."

Rookie Jimmie Johnson, driving the No. 48 Chevrolet for Hendrick Motorsports, won the pole with fellow Daytona 500 rookie Kevin Harvick qualifying second, making this the first time the field would be led by two first-time Daytona 500 participants. Ward Burton, driving the No.22 Dodge for Bill Davis Racing, won the race. This race was the last for long-time veteran driver Dave Marcis.\nAs part of the television contract signed at the end of the 1999 NASCAR season, the 2002 Daytona 500 was televised by NBC. Allen Bestwick provided the play-by-play in the booth with color commentators Benny Parsons and Wally Dallenbach Jr. The prerace show was hosted by Bill Weber, who reported from the pits with Matt Yocum, Marty Snider, and Dave Burns. This was the first time NBC televised the Daytona 500.\nBackground.\nThe 2002 Daytona 500 was the first of 36 scheduled stock car races of the 2002 NASCAR Winston Cup Series, and the 44th running of the event. It was held on February 17, 2002, in Daytona Beach, Florida, at Daytona International Speedway, one of six superspeedways to hold NASCAR races; the others are Michigan International Speedway, Auto Club Speedway, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Pocono Raceway, and Talladega Superspeedway. Its standard track is a four-turn, 2.5-mile (4.0 km) superspeedway. Daytona's turns are banked at 31 degrees, and the front stretch—the location of the finish line—is banked at 18 degrees.\nThe Daytona 500 was conceived by NASCAR founder Bill France Sr., who built the Daytona International Speedway. The race was first held in 1959; it is the successor to shorter races held on beaches around Daytona Beach. It has been the opening round of the NASC AR season since 1982, and from 1988, it has been one of four events that require cars to run restrictor plates. The Daytona 500 is often regarded as NASCAR's most prestigious race because it offers the most prize money in American auto racing. Victory is considered equal to winning either the World Series, the Super Bowl or The Masters. The race is often called the \"Great American Race\" or the \"Super Bowl of Stock Car Racing\".\nIn preparation for the race, NASCAR scheduled several test sessions on January 7–9 (for teams who finished in an odd-number position in the 2002 car owner points standings) and January 14–16, 2002 (for teams who finished in an even-number position in the 2002 car owner points standings). Every test session began at 9 a.m. EST, stopped at 12:00 – 1:00 p.m. EST, and concluded at 5:00 p.m. EST. On January 7, Stacy Compton was fastest in the first session with a speed of and a speed of by Jimmie Johnson paced the second session. Johnson led the third and fourth sessions on January 8 with respective speeds of and . On January 9, Johnson and Ward Burton led sessions five and six, respectively, with speeds of and respectively. The January 14 test sessions were cancelled due to rain; NASCAR officials elongated testing to January 17. On January 15 and 16, Jerry Nadeau, Michael Waltrip and Jeremy Mayfield paced sessions seven, eight and nine with speeds of , and respectively. The final sessions on January 17 were paced by Waltrip and Mike Wallace with respective speeds of and .\nPre-race regulation changes.\nFor the race, NASCAR mandated a series of rules regarding the aerodynamics of the cars. Restrictor plates had to have an opening of in every car, and their air dams were extended to forward on the front bumpers. The rear spoilers on the Dodge, Pontiac and Ford vehicles were required to be , wide and angled at 55 degrees. All Chevrolet cars had their spoilers shortened by .\nAfter the Ford teams reported an aerodynamic deficiency to the remainder of the field during testing, NASCAR allowed them to lower the height of their spoilers by to and wide. This change created further complications for Ford when the manufacturer had to raise the rear deck lid on its vehicle by to in order to comply with the minimum height for its rear spoiler. Later, NASCAR installed an additional template on each of the four types of vehicle in an attempt to ensure the spoiler is positioned correctly.\nIn other changes, NASCAR permitted teams to switch engines between the qualifying session and the race in an exception to its cost-cutting regulation mandating each team to use one engine per race weekend because of the Daytona 500 race format having two qualifying races to determine the majority of its starting order.\nPractice and qualifying.\nEight practice sessions were scheduled before the Sunday race. The first two were held on February 8 and lasted 120 and 110 minutes each. The next two on February 11 and 12 were shortened to 105 minutes. On February 13, two 45 minute practice sessions were scheduled. A session lasting 60 minutes was held the following day. The final practice session, scheduled for February 16, was cancelled because of rain. In the first practice session, Johnson was fastest with a lap of 48.639 seconds, ahead of his Hendrick Motorsports teammates Jeff Gordon and Jerry Nadeau in second and third. Ricky Rudd, Ward Burton, Dale Jarrett, Robert Pressley, Mike Wallace, Bill Elliott, and Kevin Harvick made up positions four to ten. Johnson led the second practice session later that day with a 48.685 seconds time. Rudd, Gordon, Ward Burton, Nadeau, Terry Labonte, Jarrett, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Johnny Benson Jr. and Waltrip rounded out the top ten drivers.\n54 cars entered first-round qualifying on February 9; due to NASCAR's qualifying procedure only 43 could race. Unlike most races during the season, the qualifying session determined the first two position, while the rest of the field qualified by the 2002 Gatorade 125s. Each driver was limited to two timed laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Johnson was the fourth driver to venture onto the track; he took the maiden pole position of his career, and his first in a NASCAR-sanctioned event since he debuted in the series at the 1998 Busch Series, with a time of 48.431 seconds. He became the third rookie driver in history to claim pole position for the Daytona 500 after Loy Allen Jr. in the 1994 event and Skinner in the 1997 race. Johnson was joined on the grid's front row by Harvick who was sixteen-thousands of a second slower, after a driver error in the third and fourth turns on his second lap. This meant for the first time in history, the Daytona 500 featured two rookie drivers starting in the first two grid positions. After qualifying, Johnson said, \"We've shown our hand during testing and practice. We didn't want to fool ourselves into thinking we had a magic three- or four-tenths hidden somewhere. We thought that some other guys had an ace in their back pockets, and we didn't expect Kevin Harvick to jump up there.\"\nAfter the qualifying session, NASCAR vice-president of communications Jim Hunter stated no regulation changes would be considered until after the qualifying races. Notwithstanding this statement, NASCAR announced from the third practice session onward, teams entering Ford cars would be permitted to lower the height of their spoiler by a further to tall in an attempt to decrease aerodynamic drag produced, and in response to the manufacturer getting two of its cars in the first 20 positions in qualifying, and its sub-par results in the 2002 Budweiser Shootout.\nIn the third practice session, Geoff Bodine went fastest with a lap of 47.776 seconds, ahead of Dave Blaney in second and Rudd third. Sterling Marlin was fourth-fastest, with Jeff Burton fifth and Dave Marcis sixth. Harvick, Greg Biffle, Ken Schrader, and Bobby Hamilton followed in the top ten. Second round qualifying was held during the afternoon on February 11 to allow drivers to improve their fastest times or set a lap in the event they were not able to in first round qualifying; the session's fastest driver, placing 27th-fastest was Kyle Petty, qualifying fastest of the four competitors who were in the session. Skinner, Norm Benning, and Kirk Shelmerdine were the three other drivers who competed in the session.\nMark Martin led the fourth practice session with a time of 47.933 seconds, with Johnson, Rusty Wallace, Benson, Jeff Burton, Jarrett, Elliott Sadler, John Andretti, Nadeau and Biffle in positions two to ten. With ten minutes of the session remaining, Brett Bodine experienced understeer exiting the second corner, causing him to slow in a plethora of cars, and drift up the circuit. Hamilton, who was close by Bodine, made contact with the latter's left-rear quarter panel, turning Hamilton into Todd Bodine. That caused a chain reaction accident involving Tony Stewart, Jeff Burton, Jimmy Spencer, and Rudd. Hamilton, Jeff Burton and Todd Bodine ventured to the infield medical center, and were released after precautionary check-ups. Hamilton and Todd Bodine switched to back-up cars for the Gatorade 125s. Casey Atwood topped the fifth practice session with a 47.342 seconds lap. Elliott Sadler, Hermie Sadler, Marlin, Kenny Wallace, Shawna Robinson, Robby Gordon, Spencer, Mayfield, and Todd Bodine placed in second to tenth positions. A lap of 47.721 seconds gave Elliott the lead in the sixth session; Compton, Benson, Blaney, Andretti, Matt Kenseth, Hamilton, Brett Bodine, Waltrip and Sadler rounded out the session's top ten drivers.\nGordon and Waltrip were the winners of the Gatorade 125s. The qualifying grid was finalized with Gordon third and Waltrip fourth. Earnhardt qualified fifth, ahead of Stewart, Schrader, Nadeau, Rudd, and Bobby Labonte. By qualifying for the race, Marcis broke Richard Petty's all-time record of 32 Daytona 500 starts with his 33rd, as Robinson became the second woman to progress to the race, and the first since Janet Guthrie at the 1980 edition. The eleven drivers who failed to qualify were Spencer, Hut Stricklin, Buckshot Jones, Biffle, Rick Mast, Bobby Gerhart, Hermie Sadler, Carl Long, Benning, Shelmerdine, and Dwayne Leik. In the final practice session, Harvick was fastest with a lap of 47.588 seconds; Sadler and Terry Labonte were second and third. Kurt Busch, Rudd, Andretti, Ricky Craven, Brett Bodine, Robby Gordon and Rusty Wallace followed in positions four to ten. Craven's engine failed as he was drafting Jarrett, prompting the latter to steer right to avoid a collision, and causing a four-car accident involving Petty, Terry Labonte, Marcis, and Brett Bodine on the backstretch.\nAfter the final practice session, and before the race, NASCAR allowed teams who entered Ford and Dodge cars to lower the rear spoilers by a further so that it was tall for Ford entries and on the Dodge vehicles in the series' attempt to continue to seek to create parity within the field.\nRace summary.\nThe drama started almost immediately as one of the pre-race favourites, shootout winner Tony Stewart, blew an engine on just the third lap. The race's first caution flew as another favourite, Dale Earnhardt Jr., ran over debris and cut a front right tire in turn 1 on lap 23 while running in second-place. He then staged a furious charge back into top 10 with a new nose after the tire tore up the right-front fender. Dave Marcis’ final Winston Cup start was brought to an end on lap 79 due to engine trouble, bringing out the second caution of the day. Just before halfway, Earnhardt Jr. got into more trouble when he this time lost a rear tire in turn 4, then ended up driving through the infield grass as he tried to get onto pit road as the flailing rubber had damaged a brake line. This brought out a third caution. On the following restart, Brett Bodine spun off of Kenny Wallace's bumper, and the yellow flag came back out for the fourth time.\nOn lap 138, rookie Shawna Robinson and Mike Skinner tangled exiting turn 2, bringing out the fifth caution of the day. But the course of the race took a twist on lap 148 when contact between Jeff Gordon and Kevin Harvick triggered the \"Big One\". The pair were battling for second place, when Harvick attempted to block Gordon on the approach to turn 1, but it came too late and the 29 car first jinked left down onto the apron, before spinning back across the track and collecting a number of cars. A total of 18 cars were caught up in the wreck, the same number of cars collected in the 2001 Daytona 500's Big One. These included Matt Kenseth, Ricky Rudd, Joe Nemechek, Ken Schrader, Jeremy Mayfield, John Andretti, Bobby Hamilton, Jerry Nadeau and Earnhardt Jr. (his third incident of the race) amongst others.\nPolesitter Jimmie Johnson’s chances of victory were dashed on lap 173 when he blew a tire exiting the tri-oval towards turn 1. His car bounced off Jeff Green, spun through the infield grass and slid back across the track in a similar manner to Harvick's, although luckily this time there were no cars behind him when the car rejoined the track. Although he kept the car off the wall, he was forced to pit for repairs and would eventually finish a lap down in 15th. The eighth caution of the day flew when Robby Gordon was spun coming off turn 2, setting up what appeared to be a 6-lap showdown to the finish, with defending cup champion and two-time 500 winner Jeff Gordon leading fellow two-time winner Sterling Marlin.\nAs the field came down to the green, chaos ensued. A chain reaction began between the eighth and ninth positions after one driver missed a gear. Five cars were involved, including the defending Daytona 500 winner Michael Waltrip, who spun towards the pits and nearly hit the pace car being driven by Jay Leno. Up front, Marlin got a run on Gordon exiting the tri-oval, and managed to get his nose underneath the 24 car. Gordon threw a late block and spun across the nose of the Dodge, in almost a carbon copy of the incident between him and Harvick. Despite smoke caused by a damaged front right fender, Marlin beat Ward Burton back to the caution flag and maintained the lead, while Gordon rejoined at the tail of the lead lap. Rather than have the race finish under caution, the officials stopped the field on the backstretch so the track could be cleared by course officials and the drivers could race to the finish.\nConcerned about damage on his right front fender, Marlin got out of his car and tried to pull the fender away from the tire while the cars were stopped, and was told to stop by pace car driver Buster Auton. NASCAR deemed Marlin to be in breach of the rule forbidding any repair work during a red flag. When the cars restarted and pulled away under yellow, NASCAR penalized Marlin by sending him to the rear of the field.\nBurton inherited the lead for the 3-lap shootout, followed by fellow Virginia native Elliott Sadler and 1986 race winner Geoffrey Bodine. These three would remain pretty much single file to the finish, while a further eleven cars set about a frantic scrap from fourth on back. 3-time 500 winner Dale Jarrett collided with Mark Martin upon taking the white flag and became yet another car to be sent spinning through the grass entering turn 1. Burton held off Sadler to claim the win, with Bodine finishing third just two years after a crash that nearly took his life in the Craftsman Truck Series' Daytona 250 at the same racetrack. Kurt Busch prevailed in the mad scrap for fourth, followed by Waltrip, Martin, top rookie Ryan Newman, the recovering cars of Marlin and Gordon, and Johnny Benson Jr.\nBurton's Daytona 500 win was the first for Dodge since Richard Petty's win in the 1974 race.\nThis was Phoenix Racing's best finish until Brad Keselowski won the 2009 Aaron's 499 at Talladega.\nAs of 2017, this has been the only Daytona 500 to feature more than one trio of brothers. All three Bodine brothers (Geoff, Brett, and Todd) had started the Daytona 500 together, as had all three Wallace brothers (Rusty, Mike, and Kenny), but never all three brothers from both families in the same year."

        "text": "The 1999 Daytona 500, the 41st running of the event, was held February 14, 1999, at Daytona International Speedway. Jeff Gordon won the pole and won the race, making him the first Daytona 500 pole sitter to win the race since Bill Elliott in 1987. Including the No Bull 5 Bonus, Gordon earned a then-record payout of $2,172,246 for winning, while the last place finisher earned $91,751.\nSilly season.\nThe start of the 1999 season was marked by three owners (Andy Petree, Travis Carter, and Joe Gibbs) expanding to 2 full-time teams for the first time in their careers. Their drivers were Kenny Wallace (Petree), Darrell Waltrip (Carter), and rookie Tony Stewart (JGR). Several new teams debuted, including Joe Bessey's new #60 and the #58 Ford owned by Scott Barbour. Speedweeks would also be marked by controversy involving Junie Donlavey's #90 Ford. Rookie driver Mike Harmon was dismissed from his team just before the Gatorade 125 qualifying races after reports surfaced that Harmon's sponsor, Big Daddy's Barbecue Sauce, was not living up to its contract obligations, as well as the team wanting a veteran driver to find more speed on the track; Donlavey's team wound up signing Mike Wallace, who'd driven for the team in the 1994-96 period.\nQualifying and Gatorade 125s.\nJeff Gordon won the pole for the race with a speed of just over 195 mph, and would start alongside former Indy Racing League champion Tony Stewart, who was making his Winston Cup debut. A total of 59 drivers would make an attempt to qualify for the 1999 Daytona 500. Bobby Labonte would win the first Gatorade 125 qualifying race after taking the lead from Gordon on lap 39. A lap 1 incident, the only caution of the First Duel, ended Dan Pardus and Jeff Green's chances at making the Daytona 500. Dale Earnhardt won the 2nd Gatorade duel after taking the lead from Stewart on lap 8. The second duel was marred by two caution periods that ended Dick Trickle, Glen Morgan, and David Green's chances at qualifying for the race. This would be Earnhardt's final win at Daytona.\nDrivers qualified for the Daytona 500 either by finishing in the top 16 in their qualifying race, through a 2-lap qualifying run, or a provisional starting spot based on owner points from the 1999 season. They had three chances to make a 2-lap time trial run that would be fast enough to make the Daytona 500.\nRace summary.\nThis race was known for Jeff Gordon's daring three-wide pass on Rusty Wallace and Mike Skinner. He passed Wallace after ducking to the apron, nearly plowing into the damaged car of Ricky Rudd. Skinner jumped to the outside and they raced three-wide for three laps until Dale Earnhardt (the defending Daytona 500 winner) gave Gordon the needed push. The race was also known for a determined Earnhardt repeatedly trying to pass Gordon for the lead on the final lap, only for Gordon to beat him to the finish. The race had a 13-car pileup on lap 135, in which eventual series champion Dale Jarrett flipped over twice but he was uninjured. This was also the first Winston No Bull 5 race of the season."

Consisted of 200 laps and 500 miles, it was the first race of the 1997 Winston Cup season. Mike Skinner, driving the #31 car for Richard Childress Racing, won the pole and Jeff Gordon, driving the #24 Chevrolet for Hendrick Motorsports, won the race. The race was broadcast on television by CBS. This would be the last Daytona 500 attempt for Delma Cowart.\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is a race track in Daytona Beach, Florida that is one of six superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the others being Michigan International Speedway, Auto Club Speedway, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Pocono Raceway and Talladega Superspeedway. The standard track at Daytona is a four-turn superspeedway that is long. The track also features two other layouts that utilize portions of the primary high speed tri-oval, such as a sports car course and a motorcycle course. The track's infield includes the Lake Lloyd, which has hosted powerboat racing. The speedway is owned and operated by International Speedway Corporation.\nThe track was built by NASCAR founder Bill France, Sr. to host racing that was being held at the former Daytona Beach Road Course and opened with the first Daytona 500 in 1959. The speedway has been renovated three times, with the infield renovated in 2004, and the track repaved in 1978 and 2010.\nThe Daytona 500 is regarded as the most important and prestigious race on the NASCAR calendar. It is also the series' first race of the year; this phenomenon is virtually unique in sports, which tend to have championships or other major events at the end of the season rather than the start. Since 1995, U.S. television ratings for the Daytona 500 have been the highest for any auto race of the year, surpassing the traditional leader, the Indianapolis 500 which in turn greatly surpasses the Daytona 500 in in-track attendance and international viewing. The 2006 Daytona 500 attracted the sixth largest average live global TV audience of any sporting event that year with 20 million viewers."

The race took the scheduled 200 laps to complete.\nNearing the race's end, two contenders for the race, Hendrick Motorsports' Geoff Bodine and Melling Racing's Bill Elliott, differed on pit strategy for the end of the race. Bodine, who was at the lead at the time, ran out of fuel with three laps left in the race, giving the lead to Elliott. Elliott was then able to fend off Bodine's teammate, Benny Parsons, to take his 18th career NASCAR Winston Cup Series victory, his first victory of the season, and his second and final Daytona 500 victory.

The race was held on Sunday, February 17, 1991, before an audience of 145,000 in Daytona Beach, Florida at Daytona International Speedway, a 2.5 miles (4.0 km) permanent triangular-shaped superspeedway. The race took the scheduled 200 laps to complete. Following a period of three late-race cautions, Morgan–McClure Motorsports driver Ernie Irvan took the lead from Dale Earnhardt with six laps left in the race. With three laps to go, Earnhardt spun and collected Davey Allison and Kyle Petty, bringing out the final caution with two laps left. Coasting to the finish on fumes, Irvan was able to take his second career NASCAR Winston Cup Series victory, his first victory of the season, and his only Daytona 500 victory. To fill out the top three, Junior Johnson &amp; Associates driver Sterling Marlin and RahMoc Enterprises driver Joe Ruttman finished second and third, respectively.\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is one of three superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the other two being Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway. The standard track at Daytona International Speedway is a four-turn superspeedway that is 2.5 miles (4.0 km) long. The track's turns are banked at 31 degrees, while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, is banked at 18 degrees.\nPit rules.\nThis race began a series of changes to pit road procedure after the death of a Melling Racing rear tire changer in a pit road accident at Atlanta the previous November.\nThe new pit procedures changed the complexity of the race. Teams considered it too time-consuming to change four tires since it had to be done under green (at the time, a four-tire pit stop would take roughly 20–25 seconds). For an example of how the rules adversely affected the racing, Kyle Petty ran the entire 500 miles on the same left side tires. Bill Elliott suffered a flat tire early on, and was forced to limp around the track at a reduced pace for two laps before he was allowed to pit, effectively eliminating him from the competition.\nBy April, the rules were changed. At Bristol, the blue/orange procedure was used only for cautions. The pits were closed at the onset of caution, then opened after the pace car had picked up the leader and the field was sufficiently \"packed-up\" (that usually took one lap). Once the pits were opened, blue sticker cars would pit the first lap by, with orange sticker cars pitting the next time around. On the restarts, blue sticker cars started on the inside and orange sticker cars on the outside. Lapped cars went to the rear. The blue/orange rule was eliminated during green flag stops. By the next week at North Wilkesboro, the blue/orange rule was scrapped. In its place, once the pits were opened during a yellow, lead lap cars only were allowed to pit on the first lap under caution, while lapped cars had to wait until the second lap.\nAfter a few weeks, the rules were relaxed further. The pit road speed limit and use of the \"lollipop\" style signboard were the significant changes made permanent (and remain to this day). The second pace car for the pit lane was eliminated. Drivers would be required to gauge their own pit lane speed (by monitoring their RPMs) and officials enforced the infractions with a system similar to VASCAR. The rule closing pit road when the caution comes out also remained in place, as well as only permitting lead lap cars to pit on the first caution lap (lapped cars on the second).\nQualifying.\nQualifying was set by the 1991 Gatorade Twin 125 Qualifiers. The top two positions were set by qualifying speeds held for the Twin 125 Qualifiers held on Saturday, February 9, with the top two qualifiers in the session earning the top two positions for the Daytona 500. The rest of the starting was set in the Twin 125 Qualifiers, held on Thursday, February 14 during two races. The top 14 finishers in the first race, excluding the pole position winner, would set the inside row from rows two to 15, and the top 14 finishers in the second race, excluding the outside pole position winner, would set the outside row from rows two to 15. The remaining non-qualifiers would set positions 31-40 based on qualifying speeds from the first qualifying session held on Saturday. If needed, up to two extra provisionals were given to teams high enough in the previous season's owner's standings that did not qualify for the race by either qualifying speed or from the Twin 125 Qualifiers.\nDavey Allison, driving for Robert Yates Racing, won the pole with a time of 45.929 and an average speed of in Saturday's session.\n16 drivers failed to qualify.\nRace.\nThe start.\nDavey Allison led the first lap from Dale Earnhardt, who took the lead entering Turn 1. On the backstretch, Earnhardt obliterated a seagull. This adversely affected his car's water temperature, raising it at one point to . It forced Earnhardt's team to make emergency repairs under one of the many early cautions in the race.\nEarly yellows.\nSprint car champion Sammy Swindell spun on the backstretch to bring out the first yellow flag. Five laps after the restart, Rick Wilson and Greg Sacks collided in Turn 1, ending Sacks' day. Just after the restart, Bill Elliott cut a tire, but had to wait for the proper lap for a pit stop. On lap 31, Jimmy Spencer's engine blew, filling the car with smoke. A fire also erupted just after Spencer climbed out to catch his breath. Meanwhile, turn 4 was coated with oil, gathering Jeff Purvis, Jimmy Means, Phil Barkdoll, and again Sammy Swindell. Barkdoll would soon spin again in Turn 4, blowing out his windshield in the spin and nearly flipping. The windshield slid across the track and into Ken Schrader's bumper and air dam, puncturing the radiator and causing a lengthy repair that eliminated the three-time Daytona 500 polesitter from contention. 1990 Winston Cup runner-up Mark Martin moved through the field quickly in the early going, but was also eliminated from contention as the center section of the car's rear gearing sheared completely off of the driveshaft, causing him to spend many laps behind the wall.\nLong green flag run.\nOn Lap 75, Geoff Bodine, Eddie Bierschwale and Phil Barkdoll ran three-wide coming out of turn 4. Bierschwale slid up the track and into Bodine's left-rear quarter panel, sending Bodine into a spin and into Jim Sauter, who was slowing to enter the pits. The caution flag came out and all four cars continued in the race. However, Bodine spent several laps in the pits because the rim of his left-rear wheel had been so badly warped in the collision that the crew could not remove the lug nuts to change the now flat left-rear tire. This incident effectively eliminated Bodine from contention and he later retired with an oil leak.\nThis would be the last caution flag for over 100 laps, and the new pit rules confused the running order during the long green flag run. The lead changed hands many times, as Dale Earnhardt, Joe Ruttman, Davey Allison, Sterling Marlin, Rick Mast, Kyle Petty, Ernie Irvan, and Darrell Waltrip had all pitted on varying laps.\nLate-race drama.\nWith 16 laps to go, Richard Petty and off-road racer Robby Gordon tangled on the backstretch. Polesitter and leader Davey Allison pitted with the leaders, allowing Rusty Wallace to take the lead. He was quickly shuffled off of the lead on the restart, and was touched by Kyle Petty in Turn 4, which broke the car loose and sent him into a spin. Rick Mast narrowly avoided Wallace, but Darrell Waltrip, unsighted, collided with Wallace's left rear quarter panel, before Wallace slammed into the inside retaining wall, eliminating both cars. Seconds later, Derrike Cope lost control entering the tri-oval while trying to avoid Waltrip's damaged car. Cope spun across the infield and back across the track almost at the start/finish line and into the path of Hut Stricklin. With nowhere to go, Stricklin slammed nearly head-on into the rear of Cope's car, sending him bouncing off Harry Gant's car and down the straightaway with no brakes and virtually no steering. At the final restart on lap 193, the order was Earnhardt, Irvan, Petty, Ruttman, Marlin, Mast, and Allison, the only cars remaining on the lead lap. Leader Dale Earnhardt was passed by Ernie Irvan a lap after the green flag returned, and Davey Allison made up four positions in one lap to run third. Irvan began to pull away while Earnhardt spent several laps battling Davey Allison for 2nd. With 2 laps to go, Earnhardt got loose while running side by side under Allison exiting turn 2. The two cars tapped each other, pushing Allison into the outside wall briefly before the car spun into the infield towards Lake Lloyd, slamming into the earthen embankment as Allison had done early in the 1989 race. Earnhardt spun down the backstretch and into the path of Kyle Petty, who slammed into Earnhardt's right front fender, launching the car into the air briefly before it landed back on its wheels. Ernie Irvan coasted to the checkers to become the first Californian since Marvin Panch in 1961 to win the Daytona 500."

He came up in front of Sterling Marlin, but had not cleared him, and also moved him up the track into his teammate Bill Elliott who was on the outside. The ensuing mayhem collected polesitter Sterling Marlin, Ernie Irvan, Bill Elliott, Mark Martin, Ken Schrader and Dale Earnhardt. Also, Bobby Hillin Jr., Dale Jarrett, Alan Kulwicki, Chad Little, Richard Petty, Hut Stricklin, Rusty Wallace, and Darrell Waltrip were involved.\nThe wreck ended the race for Jarrett, Schrader, Marlin, Hillin, and Little, with their cars being terminally damaged.\nThe finish.\nOn Lap 144 Rick Wilson was planning to pit the Stavola Brothers Ford, but Kerry Teague did not realize it and ran into him. This brought out the third yellow flag in the race. On Lap 166 Ernie Irvan's crippled car spun to bring out the fourth caution flag. Leaders Allison, Shepherd, and Michael Waltrip made their final stops. Waltrip fell back after the restart with an engine that was quitting. This left the two Ford Thunderbirds of Allison and Shepherd to race for the win, finishing in this order. This win made the Allisons the second father-son duo to win the Daytona 500, joining Lee and Richard Petty. Alan Kulwicki finished a quiet fourth which kicked off an unlikely championship run."

        "text": "The 1993 Daytona 500 was the first stock car race of the 1993 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season and the 35th iteration of the event. The race was held on Sunday, February 14, 1993, before an audience of 150,000 in Daytona Beach, Florida at Daytona International Speedway, a 2.5 miles (4.0 km) permanent triangular-shaped superspeedway. The race took the scheduled 200 laps to complete.\nIn the final laps of the race, Joe Gibbs Racing's Dale Jarrett, Hendrick Motorsports' Jeff Gordon and Richard Childress Racing's Dale Earnhardt engaged in a battle for the victory. Heading into two laps left in the race, Gordon was passed by Jarrett for second, allowing Jarrett to stay behind Earnhardt. Proceeding into the final lap, Earnhardt had let Jarrett get to the inside of his car, allowing Jarrett to pass Earnhardt for the lead by the time the two exited out of the second turn. Jarrett was then able to defend the rest of the field to take his second career NASCAR Winston Cup Series victory, his only win of the season, and his first career Daytona 500 victory. To fill out the top three, the aforementioned Dale Earnhardt and Bud Moore Engineering's Geoff Bodine finished second and third, respectively.\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is one of three superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the other two being Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway. The standard track at Daytona International Speedway is a four-turn superspeedway that is 2.5 miles (4.0 km) long. The track's turns are banked at 31 degrees, while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, is banked at 18 degrees.\nQualifying.\nQualifying was set by the 1993 Gatorade Twin 125 Qualifiers. The top two positions were set by qualifying speeds held for the Twin 125 Qualifiers held on Saturday, February 6, with the top two qualifiers in the session earning the top two positions for the Daytona 500. The rest of the starting was set in the Twin 125 Qualifiers, held on Thursday, February 11, during two races. The top 14 finishers in the first race, excluding the pole position winner, set the inside row from rows two to 15, and the top 14 finishers in the second race, excluding the outside pole position winner, set the outside row from rows two to 15. The remaining non-qualifiers set positions 31-40 based on qualifying speeds from the first qualifying session held on Sunday. If needed, up to two extra provisionals were given to teams high enough in the previous season's owner's standings that did not qualify for the race by either qualifying speed or from the Twin 125 Qualifiers.\nKyle Petty, driving for SABCO Racing, managed to win the pole, setting a time of 47.512 and an average speed of in Saturday's session.\n13 drivers failed to qualify.\nRace Summary.\nThe start.\nThe first lap was led by rookie Jeff Gordon, who was the youngest winner of a Gatorade 125-mile qualifier on Thursday. Shortly after this, CBS reporter Chris Economaki said that Rookie of the Year is an award he would be almost assured of. Engine failures for Dick Trickle and Jimmy Hensley (the latter would crash in Turn 1 in his substitution for the injured Jimmy Means) brought out the first two caution flags in the first 15 laps.\nMid-race summary.\nOver the next 110 laps, Dale Earnhardt, Ken Schrader, and Kyle Petty would lead the majority of the laps, with Jeff Gordon and Bobby Hillin Jr. leading a handful of laps as legitimate leaders. 1990 winner Derrike Cope and Harry Gant also led several of these laps, but they had pitted under the early yellows to stretch their fuel runs.\nMeanwhile, two-time winner Bill Elliott dropped out of the race on lap 99, the victim of overheating in his #11 Ford Thunderbird.\nClosing stages.\nDale Earnhardt was the leader on Lap 130 when Wally Dallenbach Jr. brushed the Turn 4 wall. Sterling Marlin and Michael Waltrip were lined up behind him, and when Marlin backed off, Waltrip tagged him and sent him into a spin. Marlin caught air as he spun by Joe Ruttman, who was coming to pit road to retire with engine failure. 5 laps after the restart, Rick Wilson and Bobby Hamilton collided on the backstretch. Approaching 50 laps to go, 1991 Daytona 500 winner Ernie Irvan was turned into the wall exiting Turn 2, eliminating a possible winner. The first major wreck happened when Dale Earnhardt touched 1992 Indianapolis 500 winner Al Unser Jr. (competing in his only Winston Cup Series race). His #46 Chevrolet crashed into the 90 of Bobby Hillin Jr., who spun into the path of polesitter Kyle Petty. Both had a heated verbal exchange, Hillin reportedly was telling Petty he had no brakes, but both were victims of circumstances. With 31 laps to go, Derrike Cope and Waltrip touched in Turn 2. Waltrip spun down into 1989 Winston Cup Champion Rusty Wallace and sent him into a horrific series of flips and rollovers in the grass. A little more than minute later, Ken Squier reported that Wallace came on the radio to crew chief Buddy Parrott and said, \"I'm okay.\"\nThe finish.\nBy this time, Hut Stricklin and Sterling Marlin presented themselves as contenders. Earnhardt led from the restart, only to be passed briefly by Dale Jarrett. The #3 was soon in the lead again, as he was pursued by the Chevrolets of Jarrett and Jeff Gordon, and the Fords of 1986 Daytona 500 winner Geoff Bodine, Hut Stricklin, Mark Martin, and Morgan Shepherd. The \"Dale and Dale Show\" commenced as Jarrett passed Earnhardt in the tri-oval as they took the white flag. As the leaders exited Turn 2, the CBS Sports producers told Ken Squier and Neil Bonnett through their headsets to let Ned Jarrett to \"call his son Dale home\". Jarrett held off Earnhardt by .16 (sixteen hundredths) of a second to claim his first Daytona 500 win."

        "text": "The 1994 Daytona 500, the 36th running of the event, was held February 20 at Daytona International Speedway, in Daytona Beach, Florida. Loy Allen Jr., ARCA graduate and Winston Cup rookie, driving the No. 19 for TriStar Motorsports, won the pole. Speedweeks 1994 was marked by tragedy when two drivers, Neil Bonnett and Rodney Orr, were killed in separate practice accidents for this race. Sterling Marlin in the Morgan-McClure Motorsports No. 4 won the race, the first win of his NASCAR career.\nAggressive Suspension Setup lead to Fatal Crashes.\nDuring Speedweeks, on the first day of practice for the Daytona 500, legendary driver Neil Bonnett crashed in turn four. Bonnett died at Halifax Hospital from massive head injuries. Three days later, reigning Goody's Dash Series (NASCAR's four-cylinder class) champion, Rodney Orr, making his Cup debut, lost control and spun in turn two. His car flipped and hit the catch fence with the roof above the driver's seat. Orr was killed instantly. After the deaths of Bonnett and Orr, NASCAR Veteran Jimmy Means announced his retirement from driving. Following these tragedies, a worried Rusty Wallace gave a lecture, calling out the drivers for over-aggression on the track, during the pre-race Drivers Meeting. In his lecture, Wallace was extremely critical of the drivers taking bold risks such as gambling on their tires, making overly-aggressive moves early in the races, and not taking much time to fix any damages to their car on pit road. In conclusion, he told the drivers, \"Use your damn heads!\" He was given a round of applause from the drivers and teams after his lecture.\nIn the middle of the Goodyear-Hoosier tire war, Hoosier released teams from their contracts three days following Orr's death. Hoosier received blame from some observers as the tires were the only linking factor between the two deaths. However, the criticism was purely speculative and NASCAR never blamed the tires for the deaths and never offered an official cause of the accident for either fatality.\nAn investigation done by the \"Orlando Sentinel\" blamed Orr's crash on a broken right-rear shock absorber mounting bracket. That same part was reportedly broken on Bonnett's car. NASCAR refused to comment on the outside investigation. In order to reduce drag, teams were using extremely aggressive suspension packages with extremely soft shock absorbers and springs at Daytona and Talladega in order to reduce drag. The cars often bottomed out, creating sparks, which became visible at Daytona after the Firecracker 400 was run at night in 1998. \nThe extremely soft shock absorbers and springs, along with aged pavement (last replaced in 1979) caused the mounting brackets to fail. By 1999, drivers were complaining about the extremely soft shock package for safety issues, and NASCAR implemented rules in 2000 mandating specification shock absorbers and springs supplied by the sanctioning body at Daytona and Talladega, where teams arrived at the NASCAR trackside office and are randomly assigned shock absorbers and springs that must be returned to NASCAR at the end of the race in order to stop this dangerous practice. This practice is not used at other circuits As of 2022, teams in the Cup Series are required to use specification shock absorbers and springs from seventh-generation specification supplier Tenneco.\nSummary.\nRookie polesitter Loy Allen, Jr. failed to lead the first lap. Ernie Irvan and Dale Earnhardt swapped the lead several times in the first 60 laps (which turned out to be a preview of the Championship battle), with Jeff Gordon leading briefly. The Big One happened on lap 62 when Chuck Bown and Kyle Petty touched in Turn 4. Petty, Robert Pressley, John Andretti and Rusty Wallace were done for the day. Hut Stricklin, Harry Gant, Bobby Hillin Jr., and rookie Jeff Burton, among others, were also involved. The race restarted with Daytona 500 rookie Todd Bodine in the lead. He was soon passed by Earnhardt and was then tagged by Gordon whom Todd thought he was clear of. Jimmy Spencer, Ted Musgrave, Brett Bodine and Michael Waltrip were caught up in a chain reaction to Bodine's spin; Brett and Waltrip would continue.\nThe finish.\nThe yellow flag was displayed with 60 laps to go when Morgan Shepherd spun, which made for interesting fuel mileage strategy. Earnhardt, Irvan, and Mark Martin came into the pits again for extra fuel. 1990 winner Derrike Cope led the field at the restart, only to be passed by Marlin and Irvan a couple of laps later. Irvan took the lead with 43 laps to go, but on Lap 180 he suddenly got loose in Turn 4. He recovered the car, but Marlin retook the lead as Irvan fell back to 7th. With 12 laps to go, Irvan was repassed by Martin, whom he had passed a few laps before, but with eight laps to go the Ford duo tag-teamed Jeff Gordon for 3rd and 4th. The two Fords swapped positions with five laps to go, and Irvan passed Terry Labonte (who was hung up behind Jimmy Hensley) in the tri-oval with three laps to go. But Sterling Marlin's Morgan-McClure Chevrolet was untouchable, and he finally won a Winston Cup race in his 279th start after eight second-place finishes. He broke Dave Marcis' previous record for most starts before his first Cup win (227th start, at Martinsville in 1975). Martin ran out of fuel with two to go, but he managed to take the white flag to complete 199 laps."

        "text": "The 1995 Daytona 500, the 37th running of the event, was held on February 19 at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. Dale Jarrett won his first career Winston Cup pole. Sterling Marlin won the race for the second straight year, his second Daytona 500 win, after leading 105 laps, including the final 20.\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is a race track in Daytona Beach, Florida that is one of six superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the others being Michigan International Speedway, Auto Club Speedway, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Pocono Raceway and Talladega Superspeedway. The standard track at Daytona is a four-turn superspeedway that is long. The track also features two other layouts that utilize portions of the primary high speed tri-oval, such as a sports car course and a motorcycle course. The track's infield includes the Lake Lloyd, which has hosted powerboat racing. The speedway is owned and operated by International Speedway Corporation.\nThe track was built by NASCAR founder Bill France, Sr. to host racing that was being held at the former Daytona Beach Road Course and opened with the first Daytona 500 in 1959. The speedway has been renovated three times, with the infield renovated in 2004, and the track repaved in 1978 and 2010.\nThe Daytona 500 is regarded as the most important and prestigious race on the NASCAR calendar. It is also the series' first race of the year; this phenomenon is virtually unique in sports, which tend to have championships or other major events at the end of the season rather than the start. Since 1995, U.S. television ratings for the Daytona 500 have been the highest for any auto race of the year, surpassing the traditional leader, the Indianapolis 500 which in turn greatly surpasses the Daytona 500 in in-track attendance and international viewing. The 2006 Daytona 500 attracted the sixth largest average live global TV audience of any sporting event that year with 20 million viewers.\nRace summary.\nOpening laps.\nOutside polesitter Dale Earnhardt led the opening lap for the first time in his Daytona 500 career. Lap 3 saw Sterling Marlin in the Morgan-McClure Motorsports No. 4 car take the lead. The first yellow flag came out on lap 9 when Joe Nemechek (in his first race for his own team) crashed and collected Brett Bodine. Two laps after the restart, IMSA and IndyCar veteran Davy Jones touched with fellow rookie Randy LaJoie exiting turn 4, clipping the wall and spinning the Jasper Motorsports No. 77 car into the pits. Before 30 laps were put on the board, sprint car king Steve Kinser crashed with Phil Parsons. Jeff Gordon took the lead from Marlin during the yellow flag pit stops. After the restart, Mark Martin and 1985 and 1987 winner Bill Elliott stopped for flat tires. On lap 43, John Andretti and 1990 winner Derrike Cope collided exiting turn 2. Both drivers continued with minimal damage, but as Cope came through the tri-oval to catch up to the field, both rear tires suddenly blew out, sending him into a harmless spin but rendering his car disabled as he could get no traction with both rear tires flat. On lap 58, Mike Wallace got loose in turn 2 and tagged Jeff Purvis, sending both cars into the wall and the 1994 and 1993 ARCA 200 winners respectively were finished for the day. Caution flag pit stops resulted in Dave Marcis staying out to lead one lap (a regular practice for Dave), and Mark Martin's Roush Racing crew placed his car in front. On lap 68, Gordon retook the lead.\nMid-race events.\nOn lap 70, rain interrupted the race for 2 hours. Jeff Gordon led Marlin, Todd Bodine, Earnhardt and Ken Schrader when the red flag was withdrawn. On lap 97, Todd Bodine spun exiting turn 4 (whether or not contact with Robert Pressley caused it was unclear), and engine failure soon took him out after the restart. He joined Purvis, Mike Wallace, Kinser Parsons, and Nemechek as the 6 cars out of the race. During the pit stops, Gordon dropped from the lead to 20th after a very long pit stop. Earnhardt was the new leader, and at halfway he led Michael Waltrip, Morgan Shepherd, Marlin and Ken Schrader to the restart. With help from Marlin, the younger Waltrip took the lead from Earnhardt for 2 laps before the defending 500 winner retook the lead. Meanwhile, Gordon was reclaiming lost ground quickly and passed Michael Waltrip in turn 2 on lap 109 to re-enter the top 10.\nOn lap 131, Dave Marcis hit the turn 3 wall and slowed to a stop in the middle of turns 3 and 4. After the restart, a small dispute developed in his pits centering on the status of his unused tires. The Penske team showed up to make an offer for the tires, but Marcis wanted the tires to go to Richard Childress Racing and Earnhardt, for whom Marcis and his team had done many miles of testing and from whom he had received an engine for the race. \"I may not have been in the Daytona 500 if it wasn't for Richard Childress,\" said Marcis of the former owner-driver.\nGoing through all of this, Marlin retained the lead until, with 40 laps to go, rookie Randy LaJoie spun on the backstretch and lost his windshield. As the yellow flag was being waved, Bobby Hamilton made contact with Rusty Wallace, resulting in Wallace's fifth straight Daytona 500 crash (4 of which resulted in a DNF, with the 1992 running as the exception). Rick Mast led a lap during the caution. 1989 winner Darrell Waltrip had a transmission failure that would cost him 20 laps to repair. Meanwhile, Gordon suffered an aerodynamic setback that would cost him the race. The jack was let down too soon on the driver's side during the tire change, and the fender was bent by the left front tire. Earnhardt would lead the field to the restart, and afterward, Gordon would brush the wall in his now ill-handling car. He brought the Hendrick Motorsports No. 24 car in for a correctional pit stop and lost a lap.\nFinish.\nWith 20 laps to go, Marlin passed Earnhardt for the lead on the back straightaway. With 15 laps to go, Bobby Labonte (in his first race for Joe Gibbs Racing) crashed in turn 1, nearly collecting his older brother Terry. Earnhardt came in for 4 new tires, gambling that maneuverability would be more valuable than track position. Just before the restart, rookie Robert Pressley spun in the short chute before turn 1 after contact from Dick Trickle. When the green was waved Earnhardt quickly re-entered the top 10, and with 10 to go, he was side by side with Ricky Rudd for 9th. He passed Mark Martin for the second position with 4 laps to go, but Sterling Marlin's Chevrolet was not to be denied. This was Sterling Marlin's second Winston Cup win, both of which were in the Daytona 500. Marlin also joined Richard Petty (in the 1974 race) and Cale Yarborough (in 1984 race) as the only drivers who have won back-to-back Daytona 500's; this has not been done (until the 2020 race) when Denny Hamlin joined. Martin went to third while his teammate Ted Musgrave finished fourth and 1993 winner Dale Jarrett (who started on the Pole) finished 5th.\nThis was Richard Petty's only Daytona 500 as a broadcaster, and the first Daytona 500 to be broadcast with a reduction in availability. As a result of the Fox affiliate switches of 1994, many markets where CBS lost major affiliates and were relegated to minor affiliates could not receive the race, including three markets where a NASCAR-sanctioned national series races were held -- Atlanta, Milwaukee, and Detroit. The Atlanta market losses affected North Georgia, where Bill Elliott is based. The mountainous areas of northern Georgia where Bill Elliott lives could not receive the race because WGCL's signal was easker"

        "text": "The 2001 Daytona 500, the 43rd running of the event, was the first race of the 2001 NASCAR Winston Cup Series schedule. It was held on February 18, 2001, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida, consisting of 200 laps and 500 miles on the 2.5-mile (4 km) asphalt tri-oval.\nBill Elliott won the pole and Michael Waltrip, in his first race in the No. 15 car for Dale Earnhardt, Inc., won the race. This was the first Winston Cup victory of his career, coming in his 463rd start, the longest wait for a first win. His teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr. finished second and Rusty Wallace finished third.\nOn the final lap, a fatal accident occurred involving Dale Earnhardt Sr., Ken Schrader, and Sterling Marlin. Earnhardt's car crashed head-on into the retaining wall, killing him. The race was also marred by an 18-car pile-up on lap 173 that began when Ward Burton made contact with Robby Gordon, sending Tony Stewart flipping twice down the backstretch. After Earnhardt's death - as well as other notable deaths of other drivers in other NASCAR national touring series in previous seasons - NASCAR, implemented rigorous safety improvements in later seasons. The 2001 Daytona 500 is the last NASCAR Cup Series race to involve a fatal accident.\nQualifying.\nQualifying to determine positions 1-2 for the Daytona 500 and the lineup for the Gatorade Duels happened on February 10, 2001. Originally, Bill Elliott and Jerry Nadeau were slated to start first and second, respectively. However, during post qualifying inspection, NASCAR determined that Nadeau had an unapproved shock absorber and spring shackle, and his time was disqualified. Stacy Compton, who was originally third, moved up to second.\nDwayne Leik would be the only driver to not set a time.\nGatorade 125's.\nThe Gatorade 125s are a pair of NASCAR Winston Cup series held in conjunction with the Daytona 500 annually in February at Daytona International Speedway. They consist of two 50 laps and 125 miles in length, which serve as heat races that set up the lineup for the Daytona 500. Both races set the lineup for positions 3–30. The first race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in odd–numbered positions on pole qualifying day. The second race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in even–numbered positions. After qualifying races, the next six positions are determined by fastest times in qualifying who have not yet made the field. The final seven positions go to provisional starters based on last year's car owner points standings. \nRace summary.\nPolesitter Bill Elliott led the field to the green flag, but he only led one lap before Sterling Marlin (the winner of the first 125-mile qualifying race three days earlier) passed him for the lead. On lap 29, Rusty Wallace drove into his pit after his right front tire had suddenly gone flat. NASCAR determined that he had exceeded the pit road speed limit on his way in and he was consequently issued a 15-second penalty. As a result, he went a lap down and attempted to make up for it by skipping the first scheduled pit stop. The first caution came out on lap 48 when Jeff Purvis bounced off the wall between turns 3 &amp; 4. The race restarted and stayed under a long green-flag run that lasted 105 laps, in which Ward Burton led the most. On lap 87, Dale Earnhardt and rookie Kurt Busch made door-to-door contact coming out of turn 4 while battling for fifth place. Earnhardt promptly flipped Busch the bird at 185 mph or, as described by lap-by-lap commentator Mike Joy, he simply was saying \"Kurt, you're number 1\".\nThe second caution came out on lap 157 when Busch, trying to pass Joe Nemechek, hit the front stretch wall and slid across the track right through the infield and onto pit road. On lap 167, Steve Park took the lead, only to be passed by his teammate Michael Waltrip on the next lap.\nOn lap 173, a huge crash eliminated 18 cars in a spectacular fashion. This began when Robby Gordon, coming onto the back straightaway, turned Ward Burton in the outside lane. Burton then hit Tony Stewart, who turned back across the middle of the racetrack, collecting most of the field behind him. Stewart took the worst ride of any driver in that crash, as his car turned against the wall after being hit by Burton, caught a pocket of air, got pushed airborne over Robby Gordon and flipped over twice, and then landed on top of Jason Leffler before coasting to a stop in the infield. Bobby Labonte's hood broke off and got attached to Stewart's car, causing his engine to catch fire. Stewart's vehicle was described as something similar to Richard Petty's rollover crash in the 1988 race. Mark Martin collided first with the outside wall and then got hit by at least two other cars, destroying the rear end of his. Martin managed to limp his car back to pit road and abandon it. Also involved in this crash were Jeff Gordon, Terry Labonte, Andy Houston, Buckshot Jones, Dale Jarrett (the defending Daytona 500 winner), Jeff Burton, Elliott Sadler, Kenny Wallace, John Andretti, and Jerry Nadeau. Only a few drivers, including Earnhardt; Elliott; Ron Hornaday Jr.; and Ken Schrader, were able to avoid the crash with intact cars. The race was red-flagged for extensive cleanup. When the red flag was over, the race restarted on lap 180, with Dale Earnhardt Jr. in the lead. Marlin led the next three laps before Waltrip took over again.\nWith less than two laps remaining, Darrell Waltrip in the Fox Sports booth commented that \"Sterling [Marlin] ha[d] beat the front end off of that...that ole Dodge just trying to get around Dale [Earnhardt].\" As the white flag waved for the final lap, both Earnhardt and his son Dale Earnhardt Jr. were right behind Waltrip. Earnhardt Jr. was in second place in front of his father. Heading into turn 3, Earnhardt, holding third-place, ran in the middle lane of the pack. Marlin, who was behind him on his left, ran in the inside one. R. Wallace drove his navy blue No. 2 Penske Racing Ford directly behind Earnhardt, and Schrader ran in the outside lane driving his yellow No. 36 Pontiac. Just as the field headed into turn 4, Marlin's car made contact with the left rear on Earnhardt's car, causing the black No. 3 to slide off the track's steep banking onto the flat apron. Trying to correct at speed, Earnhardt sharply turned it up the track toward the outside retaining wall. Although it briefly looked as if he was going to avoid hitting the retaining wall, Earnhardt went right into Schrader's path and Schrader rammed into him behind the passenger door causing Earnhardt's car to snap, rapidly changing its angle toward the wall. As Schrader came into contact, Earnhardt crashed into the wall nose-first at an estimated speed of 155–160 mph. Both cars slid down the steep banking off the track and into the infield grass. While this two-car wreck was in progress, drivers were allowed to race to the finish under green flag conditions.\nSeconds later, Waltrip (after 462 races without a win) claimed his first Winston Cup victory, with his teammate Earnhardt Jr. 0.124 seconds behind to finish second. The yellow and checkered flags came out simultaneously as Waltrip crossed the line, locking the rest of the field in their positions at that moment. R. Wallace finished third, Ricky Rudd finished fourth, Elliott (the polesitter) finished fifth, R. Wallace's brother Mike finished sixth, Marlin (who got loose after making contact with Earnhardt) finished seventh, Bobby Hamilton finished eighth, Jeremy Mayfield finished ninth, and outside polesitter Stacy Compton came across the line tenth. Nemechek finished 11th on the lead lap. Earnhardt and Schrader were credited finishing 12th and 13th despite not finishing the race. After crossing the finish line behind his teammate, Earnhardt Jr. stopped at the site of his father's wreck at turn 4. Earnhardt was extricated from his car and was transported by ambulance to the nearby Halifax Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 5:16 pm EST, reportedly surrounded by his wife Teresa, his team owner and closest friend Richard Childress, and his son Earnhardt Jr. The official announcement of Earnhardt's death was made at about 7:00 pm EST by NASCAR president Mike Helton. The death of the seven-time Winston Cup Champion largely overshadowed Waltrip's first Winston Cup victory as well as the 18-car crash on lap 173.\nMedia.\nThe 2001 Daytona 500 marked the first Cup Series race under NASCAR's new centralized television contracts, which shifted responsibility for NASCAR's media rights from the track owners (which led to events being inconsistently scattered across multiple networks, including long-time rightsholder CBS) to NASCAR itself. NASCAR entered into six-year deals with two broadcasters, Fox Sports and NBC Sports (with NBC sub-licensing cable rights to TNT, and Fox using its then-sister cable network FX), to serve as rightsholders for each respective half of the season in the Winston Cup Series and Busch Series. Fox and NBC alternated rights to the two Daytona race weekends annually.\nMike Joy joined Fox from CBS to continue as lead announcer. Former driver Darrell Waltrip and crew chief Larry McReynolds would join Joy in the booth as analysts. Joy, Waltrip, and McReynolds would consistently remain Fox's on-air team until 2016, when McReynolds became the rules and technical analyst, replaced in the booth by Jeff Gordon. Darrell Waltrip retired from broadcasting in June 2019, leaving Joy and Gordon as a two-man booth for the 2020 season until Clint Bowyer was hired for the 2021 season and Gordon leaving at the end of the season."

        "text": "The 2003 Daytona 500, the 45th running of the event, was the first race of the 2003 NASCAR Winston Cup season, having been held on February 16 at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. 2000 NASCAR Busch Series champion Jeff Green won his second career Winston Cup pole.\nPrior to the race, the drivers paid tribute by having decals on their cars in honor of the astronauts who were killed in the Space Shuttle \"Columbia\" disaster two weeks earlier, similar to the 1986 Daytona 500, in which they paid tribute to the fallen crew members of the Space Shuttle \"Challenger\" disaster. In addition, the pledge of allegiance and pre-race opening invocation given by the Reverend Hal Marchman, in his next-to-last running of the event before his retirement and subsequent death, were recited. Grammy Award-winning artist Mariah Carey then performed the national anthem.\nThe race ended after 109 laps when rain had begun pouring on the track. Michael Waltrip won the race for the second time in three years, giving him his third NASCAR Winston Cup win; all of his wins to that point had been in races held at Daytona. It was the first of Waltrip's two wins in 2003, both coming in restrictor plate races (he later won the EA Sports 500 at Talladega in October for his fourth and last Cup win). For the first time since 1966, the race was stopped due to rain; at 272.5 miles, it had been the shortest Daytona 500 ever.\nDuring lap 58 into the race, Ryan Newman had an accident in the tri-oval, where his No. 12 Dodge tumbled end-over-end onto the track's infield grass, but he was not injured in the crash.\nThis is the first Daytona 500 event that respected Winston Cup veteran Dave Marcis did not attempt since 1967, a whole season before he had started driving.\nRace summary.\nThe green flag came nearly half an hour earlier than planned, due to the impending rain showers which officials feared would lead to the race having to be completed on another day. Jeff Green was out in front at the start of the race, but he was quickly passed by Michael Waltrip who led the first 34 laps. On lap 42, the race's first caution came out after Bobby Labonte spun out entering the backstretch. Dale Earnhardt Jr. took the lead from Tony Stewart as the field raced back to the caution. The first round of green flag pit stops came on lap 50.\nOn lap 58 Ryan Newman was running in the Top 15, but defending Daytona 500 champion Ward Burton hit Ken Schrader and both he and Newman hit the wall. The rear tire fixture underneath Newman's car detached from the car as he went sliding into the infield grass, and the No.12 went airborne and when it landed, its right-rear wheel dug into the dirt, causing Newman to flip several times before landing on its roof. Most of the car came apart in the infield, but Newman was uninjured and was able to walk away from the crash. Following Newman's flip, there were six caution laps, during which a light rain began to fall, so the race was red-flagged when the rain became heavier.\nFollowing a rain delay which lasted over an hour, the race restarted with Michael Waltrip back in front. The race remained under the green flag until lap 95, when Jeff Green and Jimmy Spencer collided entering turn 4, bringing out a third caution. Spencer ended up hitting the frontstretch retaining wall and coming to rest just past the start-finish line. Spencer had a very similar crash in the 2000 race. A caution came on lap 103 for debris, and then Ward Burton hit the turn 4 wall on lap 106, bringing out another. There were three yellow flag laps after Burton's crash, and the race was once red-flagged again due to more rain. Although it briefly looked as if the race would get back underway, the race was eventually called off due to the forecast of more rain and Michael Waltrip was declared as the winner. It was his third career Winston Cup win both overall and at Daytona, and his second career Daytona 500 win. Coincidentally, Waltrip's first three wins came in the first three Daytona races broadcast by Fox.\nThis was the third Daytona 500 to have been shortened by rain, following the races held in 1965 and 1966. At 272.5 miles and 109 lap, this race was also the shortest Daytona 500 ever.\nResults.\nW = Past winner of the Daytona 500;\nR = Daytona 500/NASCAR Winston Cup Series Rookie\nWithdrew: No. 84 – Norm Benning."

        "text": "The 2004 Daytona 500, the 46th running of the event, was the first race of the 2004 NASCAR Nextel Cup season. It was a race held on February 15, 2004, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. The race was televised by NBC, with Allen Bestwick, 1975 race winner Benny Parsons, and Wally Dallenbach Jr. calling the action for the second time after the 2002 race. It was the first NASCAR Nextel Cup race to air in high definition.\nThat was first 500 race without 2-time Daytona 500 Champion and 4-time pole-sitter Bill Elliott since 1976.\nDale Earnhardt Jr. won the race, making this his first Daytona 500 victory exactly six years to the day after his father Dale Earnhardt, Sr. won his first and only Daytona 500 in the 1998 race. Tony Stewart finished second and rookie Scott Wimmer finished third.\nQualifying and Gatorade 125's.\nGreg Biffle won his first career Cup Series pole, but an engine change during Speedweeks forced him to go the rear of the field. The inside column of cars all moved up one row, promoting Dale Earnhardt Jr., who had won the first Gatorade 125, to the number one starting spot. Elliott Sadler won the second of the Gatorade 125s, after holding off two-time 500 winner Sterling Marlin. Of the 45 cars entered, the two who failed to qualify were Kirk Shelmerdine, driving his own #72 Ford Taurus, and ARCA veteran Andy Hillenburg in the #90 Ford Taurus, one of Junie Donlavey's final attempts at entering a Cup car. Andy Belmont was going to enter in the #95 for the Sadler Brothers but withdrew.\nRace summary.\nBefore the start of the race, several cars had to move to the rear of the field: engine changes for polesitter Greg Biffle, Ryan Newman, Ricky Craven, and 1990 race winner Derrike Cope. Rookie and NEXTEL Cup debutant Scott Riggs started from the rear in a backup car. This meant that Gatorade Duel #1 winner Dale Earnhardt Jr. took over the first starting spot and led the opening laps.\nMark Martin, coming off a disappointing season last year, exited the race with a blown engine on lap 8, which brought out the first caution. On lap 26, his Roush Racing teammate Jeff Burton joined him in the garage, likewise with an engine failure. Kevin Harvick made the first lead change on lap 30. Four laps later, Cope spun in turn 4, collecting Scott Riggs; this would bring out the second caution. After the first round of green-flag pit stops, Tony Stewart took the lead. He and Jimmie Johnson swapped it a few times while navigating lapped cars (most of them were at the \"tail-end\" of the lead lap, given that the lap 34 crash occurred during pit stops) before Earnhardt Jr. reclaimed the lead.\nOn lap 60, the third caution was flown when Rusty Wallace, Ken Schrader, and Jeff Green crashed on the backstretch. After the restart, Stewart and Earnhardt Jr. both battled for the lead until a huge crash occurred in the back straightaway on lap 71. This started when rookies Brian Vickers and Johnny Sauter made contact, collecting Marlin, Newman, defending 500 winner Michael Waltrip, John Andretti, Kevin Lepage, Terry Labonte; Johnny Benson Jr.; Scott Riggs, Robby Gordon, and Jamie McMurray. Waltrip got the worst of it, as his car went into the infield grass. Waltrip hit Robby Gordon which caused his left rear wheel to come off. The friction, combined with the fact that the rains had washed out the Busch race the day before, caused the tire rim to dig into the infield grass. The car flipped over three times, kicked up a lot of dirt, and came to a stop on its roof. A temporary delay under a long caution (although the race was not red-flagged) ensued as emergency crews debated whether or not to upright Waltrip's car before extricating him. The situation was exacerbated due to Waltrip's size.\nJeff Gordon led the field at the lap 81 restart. From laps, 81 to 200 were run caution-free. The main competitors during the second half of the race still were Stewart and Earnhardt Jr., who combined led 101 of the final 120 laps. They were the two strongest cars of the day, as they led for more than 156 laps (98 by Stewart and 56 by Earnhardt Jr.). When the leaders pitted at lap 137, Sauter (who was five laps down after damage to his car from the lap 71 crash) tried to pit with them but had evident braking issues. He had to swerve to miss Kurt Busch (who was one lap down after contact with Earnhardt Jr. earlier in the race punctured a tire) and flew through the pitlane at over 100 mph. Wisely, he did not attempt to stop in his pit box and came around the track to try again. His speeding penalty dropped him further back. During the final round of green-flag pit stops with approximately 30 laps to go, Biffle tried to gain ground on the leaders at the pit entry but was quite evidently faster than the pack of cars running at pit lane speed. He dropped behind them prior to pitting, but his speeding penalty dropped him out of the Top 10 and from contention for the win.\nWhen the final green-flag pit stops were over, rookie Scott Wimmer of Bill Davis Racing was out in front. The crew had only changed right-side tires, elevating him from a likely seventh or eighth-place finish to a chance to win. Unfortunately, he had no drafting partner and was caught up by the faster Stewart and Earnhardt Jr. with 25 laps to go. Earnhardt Jr. passed Stewart on lap 181 and held him off in the remaining laps to win his first Daytona 500. Earnhardt Jr. won the race exactly three years after his father's fatal crash on the final lap of the 2001 race, where Waltrip had won his first race which itself came three years after Earnhardt's win in the 1998 race.\nThis pattern of a driver with some connection to Earnhardt Jr. winning the Daytona 500 every three years (since Earnhardt, Sr.'s win in 1998) has continued. Kevin Harvick, who replaced Earnhardt after his death, won the 2007 race just barely beating Mark Martin. Jamie McMurray, driving for Earnhardt Ganassi, won the 2010 race. Hendrick Motorsports (team Earnhardt Jr. was in at that time) driver Jimmie Johnson won the 2013 race, though Earnhardt Jr. was 2nd in that race and won the 2014 race, just ten years later.\nStat Wrap.\nSource:"

Dale Jarrett won the pole and Jeff Gordon won the race, making this his third Daytona 500 win. Kurt Busch finished second and Dale Earnhardt Jr. finished third.\nAs the result of NASCAR's implementation of the green-white-checker finish rule the previous season, the race had three extra laps due to a caution with three laps to go, reaching a total distance of 203 laps and . Because of that, this was the first Daytona 500 to go longer than 500 miles. It was also the first Daytona 500 to end at sunset, around 6:18 pm EST.\nA crowd of 200,000 people were estimated to have attended this race.\nQualifying and Gatorade Duels.\nThree-time Daytona 500 champion Dale Jarrett won his third pole for this race with a speed of . 2001 and 2003 winner Michael Waltrip won the first Gatorade Duel and 2002 Cup Series champion Tony Stewart won the second. The main story focusing on the Gatorade Duels was an accident involving Jimmie Johnson and Kevin Harvick, which turned into a minor feud.\nRace summary.\nAfter a legendary “Start your engines” by Matthew McConaughey, the green flag waved with Dale Jarrett leading the field, but he lost the first lap to Jimmie Johnson and fell back through the field after a small bump from behind from defending Daytona 500 champion Dale Earnhardt Jr. Tony Stewart took the lead from Johnson on lap 4 and led 12 laps.\nThe first caution came out on lap 15 halfway through the first fuel run when Bobby Labonte blew an engine. Scott Wimmer, who had only changed two tires, led when the race restarted.\nThe second caution flew on lap 28 when Ricky Rudd spun out in the middle of the field, collecting five cars. On lap 36, Matt Kenseth, one of the pre-race favorites in trouble with a smoking exhaust, pitted under green.\nOn lap 61, there came to the start of green-flag pit stops, with the Dodges coming in first, as they did not get as good fuel mileage as others. Earnhardt Jr. was pushed by Jeff Burton coming into his pit stop, and had to back up to get out after his tires were changed, causing him to drop down through the field. There was a total of seven speeding violations on pit road during these pit stops, most notably Johnson. Once the green flag pit stops cycled through on lap 64, Jeff Gordon had the lead.\nDebris on the racetrack brought out the third caution on lap 86, with Gordon still out in front. Stewart led the race at the restart, and he was still leading at halfway and when the fourth caution came out on lap 105 for debris.\nOn lap 137, there came another round of green-flag pit stops, with Stewart still taking the lead. The fifth caution came out on lap 144 and the sixth one came on lap 155. Waltrip brought out the seventh caution, allowing him to leave the race and led to another round of pit stops on lap 164. Jason Leffler and Kasey Kahne came together on pit road, dropping them both down the field. The wreck on pit road occurred when Kasey Kahne, who was 4th when the pit stops began, was exiting his pit stall, and Leffler was turning into his, unbeknownst to Kahne. Kahne would later rebound before becoming a victim of a couple of crashes not of his own making.\nWith 32 laps to go, John Andretti, running three-wide and following a group of cars going four-wide, crashed and turned into Leffler, taking that driver out of the race. This would bring up the eight caution, with Stewart still out in front.\nStewart became the first driver since Bobby Allison in 1981 and 1982 to lead the most laps in two consecutive Daytona 500's.\nThe \"Big One\" occurred on lap 184. This began when Greg Biffle ran into Scott Riggs, collecting 11 cars in turn 3. Scott Wimmer's car took the worst of it, as his car went onto the apron, flipped over four times, spun on its nose, and crashed hard on its wheels. This crash brought out the ninth caution. Only some cars chose to pit, and Stewart and the others stayed out. Earnhardt Jr., who had languished in midfield for the earlier part of the race, was now up to third place. Kasey Kahne was right in the middle of this crash in his #9 mango colored Dodge Charger, but managed to miss it. Kahne charged again back up through the field when the race went back green.\nWhen the race restarted on lap 187, Andretti drove straight into Mike Skinner, starting a chain reaction crash (another \"Big One\") involving at least eight cars, bringing out the immediate 10th caution. This crash was the result of someone (possibly Skinner) missing a gear at the restart. Kasey Kahne was also involved in this crash, because as he checked up Dale Jarrett in the 88 accidentally punted him into the infield grass. Kahne spent a lot of time on pit road, but he did not lose a lap, and apparently his car was, or should have been being checked for fender rubs, when the race restarted Kahne made his way from about the 20th position to about the 8th position, but there was clearly still a tire rub on his right front fender; because it was clearly smoking, and FOX commentator Darrel Waltrip even made mention of it, as he made his way back up through the field again.\nThe race restarted with six laps to go. With five to go, Earnhardt Jr. briefly took the lead, but Stewart retook it on the next lap. The two drivers raced side-by-side until Earnhardt Jr. retook the lead. Gordon took the lead before the 11th caution came out with three laps to go. The caution came out when Kasey Kahne was on the outside moving forward from the 8th position trying keep his momentum up and move into the top 6 or so, as Kurt Busch made a pass on Tony Stewart, who was in the lead; but Jeff Gordon was also fighting on the outside with Stewart for the lead; Kahne slid up the race track hard probably due to a cut tire and as he did so, his teammate Jeremy Mayfield in the 19 car apparently got into the back of him as well and Kahne went into the wall. He could not get off the wall until about the middle of the backstretch, when NASCAR finally brought out the caution. Kahne would end up scored 22nd after being crashed while running 7th and possibly moving up into the top 5 to contend for the win. Oddly as the cars came around for the green flag Kahne's teammate Jeremy Mayfield came down to pit road from running 9th on the track, but apparently returned to the race and would end up finishing a position behind his teammate.\nThe race length of 200 laps and was completed under yellow, so a green-white-checker finish would take place. The race restarted on lap 202 with two laps to go. Despite much activity behind him, Gordon was able to hold off Kurt Busch and Earnhardt Jr. to win his third Daytona 500 victory.\nThis was the third-slowest Daytona 500 to go the distance, with only both the 1960 and 2011 races were slower. Two other runnings of this race in the 2000s were also slower, but they both were rain-shortened."

Nations had been limited to three fencers each since 1928. Competition took place in the Fencing Hall at the Helliniko Olympic Complex on August 14. The event was won by Aldo Montano of Italy, the nation's first victory in the men's sabre since 1920 (and second overall). Montano accomplished what his grandfather (Aldo Montano) and father (Mario Aldo Montano), both world champions in the individual event and Olympic medalists in the team competition, had not been able to: Olympic gold in the individual event. Zsolt Nemcsik of Hungary took silver while Vladislav Tretiak earned Ukraine's first medal in the event with his bronze. France's five-Games medal streak ended.\nBackground.\nThis was the 25th appearance of the event, which is the only fencing event to have been held at every Summer Olympics. Four of the quarterfinalists from 2000 returned: gold medalist Mihai Covaliu of Romania, bronze medalist Wiradech Kothny of Germany, fourth-place finisher Domonkos Ferjancsik of Hungary, and fifth-place finisher (and 1996 bronze medalist) Damien Touya of France. The favorites were Russia's Stanislav Pozdnyakov (1996 gold medalist and 1997, 2001, and 2002 world champion) and Ukraine's Volodymyr Lukashenko (2003 world champion).\nThe Republic of the Congo made its debut in the men's sabre. Italy made its 23rd appearance in the event, most of any nation, having missed the inaugural 1896 event and the 1904 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1996 tournament had vastly simplified the competition format into a single-elimination bracket, with a bronze medal match. The 2004 tournament continued to use that format. Bouts were to 15 touches. Standard sabre rules regarding target area, striking, and priority were used.\nResults.\nPreliminary round.\nAs there were more than 32 entrants in this event, seven first round matches were held to reduce the field to 32 fencers.\nMain tournament bracket.\nThe remaining field of 32 fencers competed in a single-elimination tournament to determine the medal winners.

        "text": "The Confederation of African Football (CAF) section of the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification saw teams compete for five berths in the final tournament in South Africa. The qualification stage doubled as the qualification stage for the 2010 African Cup of Nations, with fifteen teams qualifying for the finals held in Angola.\nIn total, 53 nations participated; however, due to the presence of the two tournaments' respective hosts, 52 teams were involved in each competition. South Africa qualified automatically as host for the World Cup, and Angola qualified as host for the African Cup of Nations. Both nevertheless competed in the qualifying phase to attempt to qualify for the other tournament.\nThis was the first time since 1934 that the hosts would compete in World Cup qualifiers. Angola's situation mirrored that of Egypt in the 2006 World Cup qualifiers in Africa, which doubled as the qualifiers to the 2006 African Cup of Nations hosted by Egypt.\nFirst round.\nFive knockout ties were originally required, involving the ten lowest ranked African countries (based on FIFA rankings as of July 2007). The actual draw was apparently conducted one day before the format was announced by CAF. The pairings were:\nSão Tomé and Príncipe and the Central African Republic both withdrew in early September. As a result, Swaziland and Seychelles (the highest ranked of the ten nations) were no longer required to play in this round, and the teams they were originally matched against, Somalia and Djibouti, were redrawn to play each other instead. The tie between Djibouti and Somalia was played as a one leg tie in Djibouti, as Somalia was not deemed suitable for FIFA matches; the other two ties were played as two leg ties.\nSecond round.\nThe 48 qualifiers (45 direct entrants plus 3 winners of the first round) were split into 12 groups of 4 in the draw held in Durban, South Africa on 25 November 2007. Teams in each group played a home-and-away round-robin in 2008, with the 12 groups winners and 8 best runners-up advancing to the third round. As not all groups were of equal size after the exclusion of Ethiopia and the withdrawal of Eritrea, when ranking the runners-up, their results against their group's 4th placed team would not be counted.\nSeeding.\nOne team from each of the following pots were drawn into each group.\nGroup 3.\nNote: Angola were automatically qualified as hosts of the 2010 African Cup of Nations. However, they were subject to the same rules as other nations for continuation to the next stage of the qualifiers. Failure to advance from this group eliminated them from the qualifiers for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nGroup 4.\nNote: South Africa were automatically qualified as hosts of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. However, they were subject to the same rules as other nations for continuation to the next stage of the qualifiers. Failure to advance from this group eliminated them from the qualifiers for the 2010 African Cup of Nations.\nGroup 7.\nOn 19 March 2007, FIFA announced the immediate suspension of the Malagasy Football Federation (FMF). The suspension was lifted on 19 May 2008.\nGroup 8.\nEthiopia played four matches in this group, before FIFA announced the immediate suspension of the Ethiopian Football Federation (EFF) on 29 July 2008.\nOn 12 September 2008, FIFA excluded the EFF from the 2010 World Cup qualifiers and the results of their matches were cancelled. While it was not clear if they were also explicitly excluded from the 2010 African Cup of Nations, their failure to complete the remaining fixtures effectively eliminated them from the tournament.\nGroup 10.\nOn 28 March 2008, FIFA announced the immediate suspension of the Chadian Football Federation. The suspension was lifted on 7 May 2008.\nChad was disqualified from the 2010 African Nations Cup qualifiers after failing to show up for their away match against Sudan, despite security guarantees. The match was subsequently rescheduled. Only matches between Mali, Sudan and Congo were taken into account for the qualification of the second round of the preliminaries of the African Cup of Nations. However, Chad was still able qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. This could have led to complications if Chad had advanced to the next round or if Chad's exclusion the now alternate group standings had produced different group winners and impacted on the ranking of the second-placed side.\nFor African Cup of Nations qualification:\nGroup 11.\nEritrea withdrew from the qualifiers on 25 March 2008 and were not replaced.\nRankings of runners-up.\nAlong with the 12 group winners, the 8 highest-ranked runners-up also advanced to the third round.

        "title": "Bill Burns (baseball)",
        "text": "William Thomas Burns (January 27, 1880 – June 6, 1953), nicknamed \"Sleepy Bill\", was an American baseball player who played as a pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) for five different teams from 1908 to 1912. He earned his nickname for his noticeable lack of intensity on the mound. Burns was best known for his involvement in the alleged fixing of the 1919 World Series, dubbed the Black Sox Scandal.\nBaseball career.\nBurns played in the minor leagues from 1906 to 1907. In 1907, he won a career-high 24 games with the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League.\nIn his five-year MLB career, Burns played for the Washington Senators, Chicago White Sox, Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Phillies, and Detroit Tigers. In his rookie season, 1908, Burns had a 1.69 earned run average (ERA), which was sixth best in the American League. However, he had an MLB career record of 30–52 as a pitcher and never won more than eight games in a season.\nPitching against the Tigers on May 21, 1908, Burns's bid for a no-hitter ended after 8 2/3 innings when Germany Schaefer singled to drive in the game's only run. On July 31, 1909, now pitching for the White Sox against Walter Johnson and the Senators, Burns again was one out from a no-hitter when it was broken up. This made him the first pitcher in baseball history to suffer this fate twice, a feat not repeated until Dave Stieb lost no-hitters with two outs in the ninth inning in consecutive starts on September 24 and 30, 1988. Stieb would go on to break Burns's record on August 4, 1989, this time losing a perfect game with one out to go.\nAfter his major league career ended, Burns played in the minor leagues from 1912 to 1917.\nBlack Sox Scandal.\nPrior to the start of the 1919 World Series, a group of players from the Chicago White Sox agreed to intentionally lose the series in exchange for money from gamblers. Burns met with Eddie Cicotte and Chick Gandil at The Ansonia, a hotel in New York City during the formative stages of the event.\nIt is likely that Burns operated on behalf of Arnold Rothstein, a New York businessman and gambler. Burns relayed messages back and forth between the players who had agreed to fix the games and a person whose initials were \"A .R.\". Burns lost money betting on the series.\nAfter news of the scandal broke, a trial took place in Chicago. During this trial, Burns served as a witness for the prosecution. Assistant State Attorney Edward Prindeville examined Burns during the trial. Burns testified:\nI told them I had the hundred thousand dollars to handle the throwing of the World Series. I also told them that I had the names of the men who were going to finance it. I told them they were waiting below.\nIn the 1988 film \"Eight Men Out\", Burns was portrayed by actor Christopher Lloyd."

        "title": "Brendan Ryan (baseball)",
        "text": "Brendan Wood Ryan (born March 26, 1982) is an American former professional baseball infielder. He played 10 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals, Seattle Mariners, New York Yankees and Los Angeles Angels.\nRyan was a shortstop but was a versatile enough defender that he made professional appearances at every position but catcher. The 2012 winner of the Fielding Bible Award, Ryan had a reputation as one of the best defensive players in baseball.\nEarly and personal life.\nRyan was born in Los Angeles on March 26, 1982, to Katie and Jim Ryan. He is the youngest of their four children. Ryan attended Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, California. His father was an infielder for Loyola Marymount University and holds the school's single-season record for the most hits with a wooden bat. One of his uncles, Willie Ryan, was a National Champion First Team All-American first baseman for the USC Trojans baseball team; his other uncle, Dr. Patrick Ryan, was a college sprinter at UCLA and Michigan State.\nCollege career.\nIn the fall of 2000, Ryan enrolled at Lewis–Clark State College to play college baseball in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. In his first season, he batted .375 with 5 triples, the third most ever by a Warrior. As a sophomore shortstop, he hit .359 with 34 RBIs and hit .378 with runners on. During the 2002 season, he hit safely in 18 straight games. Beyond his solid offensive numbers, Ryan gained a reputation as a good defensive infielder.\nIn the 2002 summer season, Brendan played collegiate summer baseball for the Alaska Goldpanners of Fairbanks in the Alaska Baseball League.\nProfessional career.\nIn 2003, Ryan entered the MLB amateur draft and was selected in the seventh round (215th overall) by the St. Louis Cardinals.\nRyan hit .311 for the Cardinals' rookie league affiliate, the New Jersey Cardinals, in 2003. In 2004, he was promoted to the Cardinals' Class A affiliate, the Peoria Chiefs. With a .322 batting average and 30 steals in the 2004 season, another promotion came for Ryan, this time to the High A Class team, the Palm Beach Cardinals, where Ryan was selected as a Florida State League All-Star. He was promoted again during the middle of 2005 season to the Class AA Springfield Cardinals.\nIn 2006, Ryan suffered a wrist injury in spring training limiting him to 28 games spread among four stops in the minors. That same year, Ryan appeared in 28 games for the Peoria Saguaros in the Arizona Fall League and batted .310 (39-for-126) with two home runs, 19 runs and 20 RBI. His 39 hits were tied for tops for the 2006 AFL season. He collected two four-hit games and hit safely in his first eight AFL games (.425 BA) and 10 of his first 11 (.396).\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nRyan was originally called up on and made his major league debut for the Cardinals on June 2, 2007, against the Houston Astros. He was later sent down on July 27, 2007, but was recalled on August 12, 2007, and remained with the Cardinals for the rest of the season. In his rookie year, he hit for a .289 batting average with 4 home runs and 11 runs batted in. Ryan also scored 29 runs and recorded 7 stolen bases without being caught stealing. He batted significantly better against left-handed pitching in his first season with a batting average of .354, as opposed to his .232 average against right-handers. His first major league home run was a game-winner in the top of the 11th inning off of Scott Schoeneweis of the New York Mets on June 26, 2007. His second home run also came rather dramatically, as he contributed to a four run comeback on July 4, 2007 when the Cardinals were at one point behind 4–1. The Cardinals won the game 5–4 against the Arizona Diamondbacks.\nRyan opened the 2008 season on the 15-day disabled list with a right oblique strain suffered in spring training. He rehabbed injury in the minor leagues in the first month of the season until called up on April 23. He was the Cardinals' primary utility infielder for the most of the season, although he played three games in the outfield. He was optioned to Memphis on August 6 and recalled again on September 2.\nRyan started the 2009 season in St. Louis. He went on the 15-day disabled from April 30 through May 15 with a left hamstring strain, making a rehab stint in Memphis. By June, he moved up to be the everyday shortstop, batting over .300 and playing spectacular defense. On August 20, 2009, in the second inning of the Cardinals and Padres Game, Ryan hit his first career grand slam off of San Diego pitcher Tim Stauffer. On September 19, 2009, Ryan hit a walk off single off Chicago Cubs closer Carlos Mármol. Ryan also had a home run in the 2–1 win. His game-winning single was the first walk-off hit of his career.\nBy the end of the 2009 regular season, Ryan's defense at shortstop had been recognized as a major factor in the Cardinals' divisional title. However, in February 2010, he underwent a procedure to debride dead tissue from his right wrist performed by Dr. Steven Shin in Los Angeles. The start to his 2010 spring training debut was delayed due to the surgery. He made his 2010 Grapefruit League debut on March 20, but he showed no lingering effects.\nSeattle Mariners.\nOn December 12, 2010, Ryan was traded to the Seattle Mariners for Maikel Cleto. \nOn July 26, 2011, Ryan broke up CC Sabathia's bid for a perfect game with a base hit with one out in the seventh inning.\nOn August 2, 2011, during a game against the Oakland Athletics, alert play by Ryan led to the unusual result of his reaching third on an infield hit. Ryan hit a ground ball fielded by Oakland shortstop Eric Sogard, but Sogard was left off-balance and his throw to first was late. Behind the back of Oakland first baseman Conor Jackson, Ryan ran for second which was left uncovered by Sogard, and then immediately for third as that base was also uncovered. While referred to in the media as an \"infield triple\", the play was officially scored as a single and fielder's choice.\nIn 2011, Ryan finished second for the second straight year in the voting for the Fielding Bible Award.\nOn April 21, 2012, Ryan was the final out of Philip Humber's perfect game. He was called for a swinging third strike on a checked swing, though the ball was not caught cleanly. Rather than running to first base, Ryan momentarily argued umpire Brian Runge's decision that he had swung, allowing catcher A. J. Pierzynski to throw the ball to first base for the final out. On June 8, he entered as a defensive replacement in the ninth inning of the Mariners' combined no-hitter against the Los Angeles Dodgers and made one of the game's closest putouts by throwing Dee Gordon out at first base. On August 15 of that same year, he scored the game's only run in the third inning of teammate Félix Hernández's perfect game, the Mariners defeating the Tampa Bay Rays.\nIn 2012, he won a Fielding Bible Award as the best fielding shortstop in MLB. In 2013, Ryan was replaced as the starting shortstop by Brad Miller mid-season, as Ryan had been hitting around the Mendoza Line.\nNew York Yankees.\nOn September 10, 2013, Ryan was traded to the New York Yankees for a player to be named later. On November 18, 2013, he agreed to a new contract with the New York Yankees, and on November 27, 2013, he finalized a deal worth $5 million over two years. His deal also includes a club option for $2 million, and a player option for $1 million, for the 2016 season.\nRyan opened the 2014 season on the 15-day disabled list with back issues. As of May 2, 2014, he was on the 15-day disabled list with cervical spine nerve damage and was playing rehab games at AA Trenton. Ryan played only 49 games in 2014, batting .167 with 8 RBI.\nRyan began the 2015 season on the 15-day disabled list due to a right calf strain. On August 25, 2015, Ryan made his MLB pitching debut in the eighth inning against the Houston Astros, throwing two scoreless innings.\nRyan exercised his $1 million player option for the 2016 season.\nChicago Cubs.\nOn December 17, 2015, the Yankees officially announced that Ryan had been the player to be named later in their trade with the Chicago Cubs for shortstop Starlin Castro. He was released by the Cubs on December 23, 2015.\nWashington Nationals.\nOn February 2, 2016, the Washington Nationals signed Ryan to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training. He did not make the team, but accepted an assignment to the Syracuse Chiefs of the Class AAA International League.\nLos Angeles Angels.\nFollowing an injury to Andrelton Simmons, Ryan was traded to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, in exchange for cash considerations and a player to be named later, on May 10, 2016. He was designated for assignment on May 28, but was called back up on June 1.\nDetroit Tigers.\nOn December 19, 2016, Ryan signed a minor league deal with the Detroit Tigers, worth $625,000, which included an invite to spring training. He spent the 2017 season with the Triple–A Toledo Mud Hens, playing in 112 games and hitting .236/.324/.326 with 4 home runs and 28 RBI. He elected free agency following the season on November 6, 2017.\nPersonal life.\nRyan is married and has two children. They reside in Miracle Mile, Los Angeles."

        "text": "Adam Mathias Jones (born 12 January 1980) is a Welsh former professional rugby union player who played as a lock. He captained the Wales Under-19 team and earned his first caps for the Wales senior team as a replacement against England and Scotland in the 2006 Six Nations Championship. He began his career with Swansea RFC before a spell in England with Saracens and Harlequins, before returning to Wales with Cardiff RFC. At the start of the Welsh regional era, he signed for the Llanelli Scarlets and played for them for four seasons, before a seven-year spell with the Newport Gwent Dragons. He also made appearances for Llandovery RFC, Carmarthen Quins RFC, Cross Keys RFC and Newport RFC.\nCareer.\nBorn in Swansea, he began his professional career with Swansea RFC, making just two appearances towards the end of the 1998–99 season, before a move to Saracens ahead of the 1999–2000 season. He made four appearances for Saracens, all as a substitute, and scored his first professional try for the club in that time. The following season he moved across London to Harlequins, and made 10 appearances during the 2000–01 season. After two years in England, he returned to Wales with Cardiff RFC, where he became a regular starter over two years there. In 2003, he joined the newly formed Llanelli Scarlets regional side. In four seasons with the Scarlets, he made over 100 appearances, scoring just one try in a friendly match against a select XV made up of players from the Scarlets' Welsh Premiership affiliate clubs. While playing for the Scarlets, he also made appearances in the Premiership for Llandovery and Carmarthen Quins.\nAfter being called up as an injury replacement for an uncapped match against the French Barbarians in 2000, Jones travelled with a developmental Wales team for a tour of Canada. He received his first full call-up to the Wales senior team in January 2006. After being omitted from coach Mike Ruddock's initial squad for the 2006 Six Nations Championship, Jones was called up on 24 January as cover for Jonathan Thomas, who had suffered a hamstring injury while playing for the Ospreys. He was named on the bench for the opening game against England, coming on as a temporary blood replacement for Ian Gough before permanently entering the game for the last 15 minutes. He retained his place on the bench the following week against Scotland, coming on for Robert Sidoli for the last two minutes of the game. Thomas' return from injury saw him take Jones' place on the bench for the last three games of the Six Nations, and allowed Jones to be released from the Wales squad for the Scarlets' Anglo-Welsh Cup semi-final against Bath on 4 March 2006. He started that game as the Scarlets won 27–26, and also started in the final, which they lost 26–10 to London Wasps.\nIn June 2007, Jones signed for the Newport Gwent Dragons as a replacement for the departing Ian Gough. He made his competitive debut against his former side on 1 September 2007. He extended his contract with the Dragons in 2009. \nJones retired from professional rugby in March 2014. At the time of his retirement, he had made the most total appearances in the history of Welsh regional rugby."

The program is a member of the West Division of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The current head coach is Chris Lemonis. They have appeared in the College World Series 12 times, winning their first national championship in their most recent appearance in 2021.\nHistory.\nMississippi State has won 11 SEC Championships in 1948, 1949, 1965, 1966, 1970, 1971, 1979, 1985, 1987, 1989, and 2016. The first six were won in a playoff series (with the first two being best-of-five while the rest were a best-of-three series). Since the formation of the SEC Tournament in 1977, the Bulldogs have won it seven times, in 1979, 1985, 1987, 1990, 2001, 2005, and 2012. The seven tournament championships and six playoff championships are a total of 13 SEC postseason championships, the most of any school.\nPrior to the formation of the SEC, the program won the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association championship in 1909, 1911, 1918, 1921, and 1922 as well as the Southern Conference title in 1924.\nThe program has also appeared in 34 NCAA Regionals and 12 College World Series. Out of its 12 College World Series trips, the program has appeared in two national championship series (2013 and 2021). Eight years after finishing as runner-up to the UCLA Bruins in 2013, the Mississippi State Bulldogs returned to the national championship series when on June 30, 2021, the club defeated the Vanderbilt Commodores with a score of 9–0 to finally secure its first National Championship title, which serves as the first national championship in a team-sport in school history.

The stadium has hosted 23 of the top 25 largest crowds to attend an on-campus college baseball game, which the top 10 belong solely to Mississippi State. In 2013, Paul Swaney of Stadium Journey ranked it as the number one collegiate ballpark. One of the venue's most prominent features is the Left Field Lounge, an outfield area where spectators can gather and enjoy the games in a tailgate setting, including stands built on top of old pick-up trucks and trailers.\nIn 2005, the Palmeiro Center, a indoor practice facility, was built next to Dudy Noble. The facility, made possible by a gift from program alumnus Rafael Palmeiro and his wife Lynne, features an infield practice area, additional training area, and three batting cages. A baseball coaches' office complex located between the Palmeiro Center and Dudy Noble Field was also built in 2005. The complex, which includes a baseball heritage room, was made possible by contributions from former Bulldog players Jeff Brantley, Will Clark, Eric DuBose, Paul Maholm, Jay Powell and Bobby Thigpen, along with sports agent and former Bulldog manager Bo McKinnis.\nAttendance.\nThe program has set many attendance records at Dudy Noble Field. SEC and Super Regional weekend games usually draw the largest crowds to Dudy Noble Field. Mississippi State currently holds the NCAA record for the largest single game on-campus baseball attendance at 15,586 and the largest regular season crowd for a 3-game weekend series at 39,181.

The Eastern Conference champion Tampa Bay Lightning defeated the Western Conference champion Calgary Flames in seven games, becoming the southernmost team to win the Stanley Cup. It was Tampa Bay's first-ever appearance in the final. For Calgary, it was the team's third appearance, and first since their championship season of . Lightning owner William Davidson would soon become the first owner in sports history to win two championships in one year as eight days later, the other team that Davidson owned (the Detroit Pistons of the NBA) won the NBA title in five games over the Los Angeles Lakers. This was the last Stanley Cup Finals played for two years, as the 2004–05 NHL lockout began three months after the end of this final, lasting over ten months and leading to the cancellation of the 2005 Final, with the league not returning to play for the Cup until 2006. This was the last of three consecutive Finals to feature a team making its debut appearance.\nPaths to the Finals.\nTampa Bay Lightning.\nTampa Bay finished the season with 106 points and entered the playoffs as the Eastern Conference’s top seed. They defeated the eighth, seventh, and third-seeded teams, beating the New York Islanders 4–1, the Montreal Canadiens 4–0 and the Philadelphia Flyers 4–3, in order, and they advanced to the Finals for the first time in franchise history since their establishment in 1992. It was also the third and final year in a row in which a team made their debut Finals appearance, after the Carolina Hurricanes and Anaheim Ducks.\nCalgary Flames.\nCalgary finished the season with 94 points, qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since 1996. As the sixth seed, they defeated the Western Conference's top three seeded teams, which were the Vancouver Canucks 4–3, the Detroit Red Wings 4–2 and the San Jose Sharks 4–2, in order, and made it to the Finals for the first time since 1989. This also marked the first time a Canadian team made it to the Finals since the Vancouver Canucks lost to the New York Rangers in the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals.\nGame summaries.\nGame one.\nThe first game, at St. Pete Times Forum, saw the Flames win 4–1. Dave Andreychuk began the game with a record 634 career goals without a Stanley Cup Finals appearance. Calgary only got 19 shots off against the Lightning defense, but more than one-fifth found the net. Martin Gelinas got Calgary on the board early, and they extended the lead to 3–0 in the second period on goals by Jarome Iginla, his 11th of the playoffs, and Stephane Yelle. Chris Simon added the fourth and final Calgary goal after Tampa Bay's Martin St. Louis scored the lone Lightning goal.\nGame two.\nGame two saw the same final score, but this time, it was Tampa Bay winning a clutch game to tie the series, 1–1, headed to Calgary. Ruslan Fedotenko's 10th goal of the postseason got the Lightning on the board first, and Tampa Bay used three third-period goals, coming from Brad Richards, Dan Boyle, and St. Louis, respectively, to blast the game open. The lone Calgary goal was scored by Ville Nieminen.\nThese Finals would be the last until 2013 to be tied after two games. The team with home ice in games one and two held a 2–0 edge in every Final between 2006 and 2011. In 2012, the Los Angeles Kings won the first two games at New Jersey.\nGame three.\nThe series shifted to the Pengrowth Saddledome in Calgary, where Flames goalie Miikka Kiprusoff and the Calgary defense completely stonewalled the Tampa Bay attack, which only took 21 shots in a 3–0 Flames victory. Simon scored the first Calgary goal in the second period, and Shean Donovan and Iginla added goals to ice the game.\nGame four.\nWith a chance to take a commanding 3–1 series lead, Calgary was shut out by Lightning goalie Nikolai Khabibulin, who recorded his fifth shutout of the postseason, a 29-save shutout, in a 1–0 Tampa Bay victory, with the game's lone goal being scored by Brad Richards three minutes into the game on a two-man advantage.\nWith 4:13 left in the game, Ville Nieminen checked Vincent Lecavalier into the boards from behind, drawing a five-minute major penalty for boarding, a game misconduct penalty, and an eventual game five suspension. Meanwhile, fans at the Pengrowth Saddledome angrily booed referees Kerry Fraser and Brad Watson throughout most of the contest. They were originally also scheduled to work game six in Calgary but the league eventually decided to replace them.\nGame five.\nThe series returned to Tampa Bay tied, 2–2, for a critical game five, and Calgary pulled off a 3–2 overtime victory to move within one win from the Stanley Cup. After Gelinas and St. Louis traded goals in the first period, Iginla scored for Calgary late in the second period. However, Fredrik Modin tied the game for the Lightning 37 seconds into the third period. The 2–2 score held until after 14:40 had gone by in overtime, when Oleg Saprykin's first goal since the first round won the game for the Flames.\nGame six.\nBack to Calgary for game six, each team scored two second-period goals, with Richards scoring two for the Lightning and Chris Clark and Marcus Nilson for the Flames. In the third period, there was a dispute over a Martin Gelinas redirect that appeared to have gone in off of his skate. A review from one camera angle appeared to show the puck crossing the goal line before Khabibulin's pad dragged it out, though some (including Lightning Tim Taylor) argue that the puck had not only been knocked several inches \"above\" the goal line (thus making there appear to be white ice between the puck and the goal line) in front of Khabibulin's pad, but that it was also \"kicked\" by Gelinas. The play was never reviewed. However, the ABC broadcast of Game 7 showed a CGI video analysis of the play, which estimated that the puck did not completely cross the line, and that the call on the ice was correct. The CGI company who did the analysis of the video was based out of Calgary. The game entered overtime with the Flames needing only a goal to win the Stanley Cup. However, thirty-three seconds into the second overtime, St. Louis put in the game-winner for the Lightning to force a winner-take-all seventh game in Tampa.\nGame seven.\nIn a tense game seven, Fedotenko scored goals for Tampa Bay late in the first period and late in the second period for a 2–0 lead. After Conroy scored to narrow the deficit to 2–1, Calgary bombarded Khabibulin after taking only seven shots in the first two periods. After the Conroy goal, Khabibulin stopped 16 Calgary shots. The series ended as Flames center Marcus Nilson missed a last-second opportunity to force overtime. Tampa Bay won the game, 2–1, and the Stanley Cup. Tampa wouldn't win another championship until 2020.\nTeam rosters.\nYears indicated in boldface under the \"Finals appearance\" column signify that the player won the Stanley Cup in the given year.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 2004 Stanley Cup was presented to Lightning captain Dave Andreychuk by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman following the Lightning's 2–1 win over the Flames in game seven\nThe following Lightning players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n2003–04 Tampa Bay Lightning\nStanley Cup engraving.\nAll 52 members were included with their full first and last names on the presentation Stanley Cup, filling the last spot on it. When the engraver Louise St. Jacques went to engrave the replica Stanley Cup, there was less space available. There was more space between each winning team on the replica Stanley Cup than on the presentation Stanley Cup. Louise decided to keep each member's name in the same order on the same line on the replica Stanley Cup, so all names were engraved with their first initial and full last name. This is another way of telling the presentation Stanley Cup from the replica Stanley Cup. (see 1984 Stanley Cup Finals and 1993 Stanley Cup Finals)\nBroadcasting.\nIn the United States, this was the last Stanley Cup Finals to air on ABC and the ESPN family of networks until the 2022 Finals. ESPN televised the first two games while ABC broadcast the rest of the series. Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, which suspended play for the next season, this marked the end of ESPN's third run and ABC's second run as the main NHL broadcasters. NBC and OLN would pick up the rights to broadcast the NHL for the season. The Comcast-owned OLN would later be renamed Versus for the season, then re-branded as NBCSN on January 2, 2012, following Comcast's 2011 acquisition of NBC, effectively moving to the \"NHL on NBC\" banner. The Finals would also be the last time a Canadian team played a game on ABC (regular season and postseason) until 2024.\nIn Canada, the CBC's broadcast of game seven of the Finals drew 4.862 million viewers, making it the highest-rated NHL game on the CBC since game seven of the 1994 Final, which drew 4.957 million viewers. However, those numbers include both pre-game and post-game coverage. The game itself drew 5.560 million viewers, up from 5.404 in 1994."

        "text": "The 2001 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 2000–01 season, and the culmination of the 2001 Stanley Cup playoffs. It was contested between the Eastern Conference champion and defending Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils and the Western Conference champion and Presidents' Trophy-winning Colorado Avalanche. It was Colorado's second appearance in the Finals, and the first since the team won the Cup in 1996. It was New Jersey's third appearance in the Finals and second straight appearance after winning the Cup in the previous year.\nColorado defeated New Jersey in seven games to win their second Stanley Cup in franchise history. Colorado's Patrick Roy was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the 2001 playoffs. This was the first Stanley Cup Finals since that would be decided in the maximum seven games. This was also the first and, as of 2023, most recent Finals since that the number one seeds in each conference met in the Finals. This marked the only time in NHL history where two teams who occupied the same market at different times faced off against each other. The Devils were based out of Denver as the Colorado Rockies from 1976 to 1982 and the Avalanche established themselves in the city in 1995 after relocating from Quebec City.\nPaths to the Finals.\nNew Jersey defeated the Carolina Hurricanes 4–2, the Toronto Maple Leafs 4–3 and the Pittsburgh Penguins 4–1 to advance to the Finals.\nColorado defeated the Vancouver Canucks 4–0, the Los Angeles Kings 4–3 and the St. Louis Blues 4–1 to advance to the Finals.\nGame summaries.\nThis was the second straight Finals that featured two relocated NHL teams and the first ever Finals that featured two teams playing in a city that was the previous home of one team and the present home of another. The Colorado Rockies were formerly based in Denver and were relocated to East Rutherford and renamed the New Jersey Devils prior to the season. The Quebec Nordiques were relocated to Denver and renamed the Colorado Avalanche prior to the season.\nColorado centre Joe Sakic scored his 10th and 11th goal of the playoffs in the first and second periods of game one. The Avalanche smothered the New Jersey defense and scored five goals in the game. The Devils did not score any goals, and in the third period, after the game was 5–0, things culminated in a fistfight between the Avalanche's Chris Dingman and the Devils' Sean O'Donnell. The third period had a total tally of 44 penalty minutes accumulated by both clubs.\nThe second game began with goals in the first period by Colorado's Sakic and New Jersey's Bob Corkum and Turner Stevenson. The 2–1 lead by the Devils held throughout the game as they defeated the Avalanche to even the series at one game apiece.\nGame three was held in New Jersey. Devils centre Jason Arnott scored an early power-play goal, but in the tenth minute, the Avalanche evened through defenceman Martin Skoula. Neither team scored any goals in the second period. Early in the third, Colorado defenceman Ray Bourque scored a power-play goal to break the tie. Five minutes later, Colorado winger Dan Hinote scored the team's third goal, and the Devils did not respond. The win by Colorado marked another road win in the series.\nIn the first period of game four, Colorado scored an early goal when Rob Blake shot the puck past Devils goalkeeper Martin Brodeur. Patrik Elias and New Jersey responded when he scored a short-handed goal to even the score at one goal apiece. Later in the second, Avalanche centre Chris Drury scored to give the Avalanche a one-goal lead going into the third period. But the third period belonged to the Devils: Scott Gomez and Petr Sykora each scored a goal in the third, and Brodeur stopped every puck that went his way. The New Jersey offence overwhelmed the Avalanche defense as they managed 35 shots; Colorado managed only 12 shots. New Jersey again evened the series, this time at two games apiece.\nIn Colorado for game five, Devils forward Patrik Elias started the scoring for the Devils as they jumped out to an early one-goal lead. Exactly seven minutes later, Colorado winger Alex Tanguay tied the game on the power-play. However, in the late minutes of the first period, New Jersey forward Alexander Mogilny scored the game's eventual winner. In the second period, Devils forward Sergei Brylin scored a power-play goal to give the Devils a two-goal lead, and in the third period, centre John Madden scored a fourth goal for insurance. The Devils won and reclaimed the home-ice advantage; they eventually won 4–1. They forced the Avalanche to try to win on the road to force a Game 7 in Denver.\nGame six paralleled game one for the Avalanche. The Devils tested the Avalanche early with a barrage of shots on goaltender Patrick Roy. After stopping them all, and with two minutes remaining in the first period, Colorado defenceman Adam Foote scored an unassisted goal to give the Avalanche the lead on just their fourth shot. Early in the second period, Avalanche winger Ville Nieminen scored a power-play goal, and late in the second period, Drury scored his 11th goal of the playoffs to give the Avalanche a commanding lead entering the third period. Alex Tanguay scored the only goal of the third period and the Avalanche won to force a deciding game seven in Denver. Despite Colorado's high number of penalty minutes, the Devils were unable to put anything past Roy.\nAround eight minutes into game seven, Alex Tanguay of the Avalanche scored the period's only goal. Colorado then scored two consecutive goals in the second period: another by Tanguay, his sixth of the playoffs, and a power-play goal scored by Joe Sakic, his 13th of the playoffs. Shortly after Sakic's goal, Petr Sykora and the Devils sprang into life when he scored a power-play goal. It left the Devils with only two goals to overcome, but Roy and the Avalanche would prove too much for the Devils in the third period as Colorado defensively shut the door on New Jersey to win the game and the series.\nThe Avalanche winning the Stanley Cup made this the second straight year that the defending champions lost in the Finals, as the Devils themselves defeated the 1999 Cup champion Dallas Stars the year before. This was the first and only Stanley Cup championship for defenceman Ray Bourque who, after being traded from the Boston Bruins to Colorado in 2000, retired from the NHL after the Avalanche's 2001 Cup win. This was the last major professional sports championship won by a Denver-based team until 2016, when the Denver Broncos won Super Bowl 50 in the 2015 NFL season. This would also be the Avalanche's last Stanley Cup title and Finals appearance until 2022, when they defeated the defending champion Tampa Bay Lightning in six games.\nTeam rosters.\nYears indicated in boldface under the \"Finals appearance\" column signify that the player won the Stanley Cup in the given year.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 2001 Stanley Cup was presented to Avalanche captain Joe Sakic by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman following the Avalanche's 3–1 win over the Devils in game seven\nThe following Avalanche players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n2000–01 Colorado Avalanche\nBroadcasting.\nIn Canada, the series was televised on CBC.

        "text": "Bobby Lee Collins (born October 30, 1965) is an American college basketball coach and the former head men's basketball coach at Maryland Eastern Shore. Prior to Maryland Eastern Shore, Collins had been the head coach at Winston-Salem State University and Hampton University.\nPlaying career.\nCollins played collegiate basketball at Eastern Kentucky University from 1987 until 1991, earning All-Ohio Valley Conference Honorable Mention in his senior season. After earning his degree in business administration and management, he played one season overseas in Finland before returning to his alma mater to spend two years as an admissions counselor. In 1994, Collins took his first coaching job as an assistant to Jeff Capel II with the Old Dominion Monarchs.\nCoaching career.\nHe left Old Dominion after one season to join the coaching staff at Hampton. As a part of the Pirates' staff, Collins helped a program that was transitioning to Division I upon his arrival become a constant presence at the top of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference. This rise to the top reached its apex with back-to-back MEAC tournament titles in 2001 and 2002. The 2001 Pirates squad pulled off one of the most memorable upsets in the history of the NCAA tournament, playing as a 15-seed and defeating the second-seeded Iowa State Cyclones in the first round.\nHampton.\nFollowing the 2002 season, Hampton's then-head coach Steve Merfeld left the school to take over at the University of Evansville. Shortly thereafter, Collins was promoted to the position as head coach, his first-ever head coaching position.\nWhile Collins was still able to be competitive with the Pirates, he was never able to quite match the same high level of success set by Merfeld. Hampton won 19 games in Collins' first season, a school record for most wins by a first-year coach, but fell just short of a third consecutive MEAC title with a loss to South Carolina State in the MEAC championship game. The Pirates returned to the MEAC title game in 2005, but again fell short, this time falling to Delaware State. Collins was, however, named the MEAC Coach of the Year for his efforts.\nIn 2006, after finishing in a tie for 5th during the regular season, the Pirates made a surprise run through the MEAC tournament and won their third MEAC title, and their first with Collins at the helm. However, their 16–15 record before the NCAA tournament sent Hampton to the opening-round game in Dayton, Ohio, where the Pirates were eliminated by Monmouth. Just two days after the loss, Collins resigned as the head coach of the Hampton Pirates.\nWinston-Salem State.\nCollins returned to his home state in September 2006 when he was hired to lead the Winston-Salem State Rams in their first season of Division I competition. In his first season with the Rams, playing as an independent with a schedule mostly of road games, Collins managed a 5–24 record. The 2007–2008 season, Collins' second with the team, marked the Rams' first season of MEAC competition. In 2010, Winston-Salem State returned to Division II, where the Rams had four-straight winning seasons and two NCAA tournament appearances.\nMaryland Eastern Shore.\nOn April 8, 2014, Collins accepted the head coaching job at Maryland Eastern Shore, returning to coaching in the MEAC with the third different team in his career. 2014–2015 \"Win Today\" Results: \n– 100% Graduation Rate\n– Best WINNING season in 41 years\n– From 6–24 (.200) to 18–15 (.545): 34.5% improvement\n– 3–1 (.750) in the Atlantic 10 Conference\n– 11–5 (.687) in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference MEAC\n– 2015 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament (first in 30 years)\n– MEAC Coach of the Year\n– MEAC Rookie of the Year: Ryan Andino\n– Riley Wallace National Player of the Year: Mike Myers\n– The Ben Jobe Award National Coach of the Year\n– The Hugh Durham Award National Coach of the Year Finalist\nOn March 26, 2018, Collins contract with Maryland Eastern Shore was not renewed after 4 seasons.\nPersonal.\nCollins, a Southern Pines, North Carolina native, played four years for the Eastern Kentucky University Colonels and played professional basketball in Helsinki, Finland."

The 1994–95 NHL regular season was shortened to 48 games, and the playoffs pushed to a later date, due to a lockout. The sixteen teams that qualified, eight from each conference, played best-of-seven series for the conference quarterfinals, semifinals and championships, and then the conference champions played a best-of-seven series for the Stanley Cup. In the Finals, the New Jersey Devils swept the favored Detroit Red Wings in four games to win their first championship.\nThis was the only time Patrick Roy missed the playoffs in his career. His team, the Montreal Canadiens, missed the playoffs for the first time since 1970. The Canadiens and the Ottawa Senators missed the playoffs this year. Montreal and Ottawa did not miss the playoffs in the same year again until 2016, when all Canadian teams missed the playoffs. The Quebec Nordiques played their last playoff series during this time. They would move to Denver, Colorado during the summer. For the first time since 1980, no league semifinal/conference final games were played in Canada.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThe following teams qualified for the playoffs:\nPlayoff bracket.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nConference quarterfinals.\nEastern Conference quarterfinals.\n(1) Quebec Nordiques vs. (8) New York Rangers.\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these two teams.

This was the third Conference Final appearance for New Jersey and the second consecutive appearance after losing to the New York Rangers in seven games the year before. Philadelphia made their fourth Conference Final appearance and first since losing to Montreal in six games in 1989.\nNew Jersey handed Philadelphia their first two playoff home losses of the season winning 4–1 in game one and 5–2 in game two and they outshot the Flyers 28–21 and 24–20 respectively. In game three Philadelphia played with a sense of urgency. Trailing 2–1 the Flyers tied the game on Rod Brind'Amour's goal with 6:03 to go in regulation. They went on to win the game 3–2 on captain Eric Lindros' goal at 4:19 of the first overtime period. Playing with their newfound confidence the Flyers won game four by a score of 4–2 despite being outshot 34–19, Flyers goaltender Ron Hextall made 32 saves. In game five the Devils took a 2–1 lead into the second period which ended up scoreless. The Flyers tied the game on Kevin Dineen's second goal of the game at 3:13 of the third period. The Devils almost regained the lead on Stephane Richer's breakaway shot that hit the crossbar with less than four minutes to go in regulation. Then with less than a minute remaining Devils forward Claude Lemieux picked up the puck on a backcheck in the New Jersey zone and skated up the ice, once over the Flyers' blue line Lemieux fired a slap shot that beat Hextall on his blocker side. The goal silenced the Spectrum crowd and gave New Jersey a 3–2 lead with just 44.2 seconds to play. The Devils hung on to win the game 3–2.\nIn game six Philadelphia opened the scoring on Jim Montgomery's goal at 4:05 of the first period. The Devils calmly utilized the neutral-zone trap to shut down the Flyers' offense while their forwards took advantage. Stephane Richer tied the game with a power play goal at 10:25 and Brian Rolston put the Devils up 2–1 with a goal at 18:15. The scored remained 2–1 for New Jersey until midway through the second period. After a blocked shot by Devils defenceman Shawn Chambers led to a three on one rush for New Jersey, Randy McKay scored his seventh goal of the postseason. The Devils made it 4–1 at 10:11 of the third period when Bobby Carpenter passed the puck past Flyers defenceman Karl Dykhuis up to Claude Lemieux at center ice who went in on a breakaway and scored his league leading eleventh goal of the playoffs. The Flyers fought back as Mikael Renberg scored on the power play at 16:29 to cut the Devils' lead to 4–2 but New Jersey held on to the lead and went on to win the game and series, advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in team history.\nWestern Conference final.\n(1) Detroit Red Wings vs. (4) Chicago Blackhawks.\nThis was the 14th playoff series between these two teams, with Chicago winning eight of the thirteen previous series. They last met in the 1992 Norris Division Final where Chicago swept Detroit in four games. This was the seventh conference final appearance for Chicago and first since 1992 where the Blackhawks swept Edmonton in four games. Detroit made their third conference final appearance and first since losing to Edmonton in five games in 1988.\nGame one of the series at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit saw a goaltending battle between Ed Belfour and Mike Vernon. The two teams skated to a 1–1 tie after regulation before Nicklas Lidstrom scored the game-winning goal for Detroit at 1:01 of the first overtime period. It was the first overtime playoff game that Detroit had won at home since 1960. In game two Chicago led by a score of 2–1 after two periods on goals by Chris Chelios and Tony Amonte. In the third period, Detroit kept pressing and eventually tied the game on Doug Brown's goal. Kris Draper scored the winner for Detroit with just 1:45 remaining in regulation.

        "text": "The 1991 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 1990–91 season, and the culmination of the 1991 Stanley Cup playoffs. It was contested by the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Minnesota North Stars. It was the Penguins' first Final series appearance and their first Stanley Cup victory. This is the first and only (to date) Stanley Cup Finals to feature two teams from the expansion group of 1967. It was Minnesota's second Final series appearance, and their last before the franchise's relocation to Dallas two years later. It was also the first time since that an American franchise would win the Stanley Cup. This was the first all-American finals since , which also featured the North Stars in their first appearance.\nThis was also the first final since not to feature either of the two Alberta-based teams, the Calgary Flames or the Edmonton Oilers, and the first since not contested by a team from Western Canada, or Canada overall.\nThe Finals and the NHL season ended on May 25, marking the last time to date that the Stanley Cup playoffs ended before the month of June.\nPaths to the Finals.\nMinnesota defeated the first-place overall Chicago Blackhawks 4–2, the second-place overall St. Louis Blues 4–2, and the defending Cup champion Edmonton Oilers 4–1 to advance to the Finals. The North Stars became the first American team and first Norris Division team to win the Campbell Conference since the league re-aligned the divisions and adopted a divisional-based playoff format in 1981.\nPittsburgh defeated the New Jersey Devils 4–3, the Washington Capitals 4–1 and the Boston Bruins 4–2.\nGame summaries.\nPittsburgh centre Mario Lemieux, despite missing a game due to a back injury, recorded 12 points in 5 games to lead all scorers and won the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nLemieux scored one of the most famous goals in NHL history during the second period of game two. Receiving the puck in the Penguins' end of the ice, Lemieux skated solo into the North Stars' zone facing two defensemen (Shawn Chambers and Neil Wilkinson) as well as goaltender Jon Casey. Lemieux skirted the puck through the legs of Chambers, skated around him, baited goaltender Casey to commit left (Lemieux's right), then switched the puck to his backhand side and slid the puck into the net (before crashing into the net himself). A brief video of the goal has since been featured on Stanley Cup promotional advertisements by the NHL.\nTeam rosters.\nYears indicated in boldface under the \"Finals appearance\" column signify that the player won the Stanley Cup in the given year.\nMinnesota North Stars.\nNote: \"Neal Broten served as the North Stars acting team captain during the 1991 Stanley Cup playoffs. Curt Giles, who was injured late in the season and played in only 10 playoff games, missing the entire finals, is listed as the official team captain.\"\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1991 Stanley Cup was presented to Penguins captain Mario Lemieux by NHL President John Ziegler following the Penguins 8–0 win over the North Stars in game six.\nThe following Penguins players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1990–91 Pittsburgh Penguins\nBroadcasting.\nIn Canada, the series was televised in English on the CBC and in French on SRC.\nIn the United States, the series aired nationally on SportsChannel America. However, SportsChannel America's national coverage was blacked out in the Minnesota and Pittsburgh areas due to the local rights to North Stars and Penguins games in those respective TV markets. In Minnesota, KMSP-TV aired games one, two and five while the Midwest Sports Channel had games three, four, and six. In Pittsburgh, KBL televised games one, two and five while KDKA aired games three, four, and six. Had there been a game seven, it would have aired on KMSP-TV in Minnesota and KBL in Pittsburgh respectively."

The Trojan Oaks was from the longest tee. The par for the course was 36 with a course rating of 35.5 and a slope rating of 125. The greens and fairways were both Bermuda grass. The course was built over the course of two years and opened in 1977 under the supervision of Chancellor Ralph Wyatt Adams. The course was closed in March 2010 in order to build a new basketball arena on the grounds.\nThe course does not attract a great deal of extra-county players, other than faculty and students of the university. This is in part due to the presence of a course on the world-renowned Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail in nearby Montgomery.\nThe remaining parts of the course that were left following the construction of Trojan Arena have been converted into what is now called the Troy Golf Practice Course. The $1.5 million renovation of the course was completed in 2013. It uses 40 acres of the original Trojan Oaks Golf Course and created a 9-hole, par-34 practice course plus state-of-the-art putting and chipping greens, a wedge practice area, a full driving range, and a new golf clubhouse. A golf clubhouse has coaches offices and an indoor/outdoor lounge area. The courses hitting bays feature FlightScope Technology for swing analysis, Sam PuttLab for putting analysis, and BodiTrak monitors to measure the body weight shifting of a players swing. It is the only course of its kind on the Sun Belt Conference.\nThe Course.\n\"Note: All tee distances are from the men's (white) tee box\""

        "text": "Tom Green (born August 29, 1949) is an American basketball coach and former player. He is the former head basketball coach at the City College of New York. He was previously the head coach at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Hackensack / Teaneck, New Jersey, where he led the team to a 407–351 record in 26 seasons leading the team. Green had led the Knights to two National Invitation Tournament bids and four NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship appearances, the most recent in 2004–05 when the team played the top-seeded University of Illinois and lost by 12 points after trailing by one at the half, losing to a team that lost in the National Championship game to the University of North Carolina.\nGreen led the Fairleigh Dickinson University Knights to postseason tournament championships in the Northeast Conference in 1985, 1988, 1998 and 2005, and won league regular season titles in 1986, 1988 and again in 2006. Green was named Northeast Conference Coach of the Year in 1985 and 1986. He coached the team to consecutive seasons with 20 wins in both 2004–05 and 2005–06.\nCareer.\nGreen was named as head coach by FDU in May 1983, succeeding J. Donald Feeley, whose recruiting had led to a team stocked with players who had academic problems.\nGreen led the team to a 21–10 record in the 1984–85 season. The team won in the ECAC Metro Conference and earned itself a berth in the 1985 NCAA tournament, the first in team history. FDU lost to the top-seeded University of Michigan by a score of 59–55 in the tourney's first round.\nHis last two seasons with the Knights were described by \"The Record\" as \"two of the worst of Green's career\", with the team going 8–20 in 2007–08, which deteriorated to 7–23 (3–13 in conference play) in 2008–09, in what turned out to be his final season as head coach. The team missed the Northeast Conference playoffs in both seasons, and his 400th win in the final game of the 2007–08 season was one of the few highlights of these seasons.\nWith one year remaining on his contract, Green was dismissed by FDU athletic director David Langford, who recognized Green's contributions and noted that \"Coach Green has worked for FDU for 26 years and done a lot of good things, and helped the university with its visibility and we're very thankful to him for that.\" Green criticized the circumstances of his dismissal, stating that \"This decision kills my career\" and that he had hoped to spend some five more years coaching and had built up a healthy team for the 2009–10 season that he had already begun practices with during the spring.\nGreen then took the job as head coach at The City College of New York in the 2011–12 season. He replaced Andy Stampfel, who coached the last CCNY men's basketball conference championship team back in 2003. Under Green, the team reached the playoffs four times, including a trip to the CUNY Athletic Conference Championship Game in 2017 after posting a 17–10 record. The CCNY Beavers lost to Staten Island 77–66, but Green's 2016–2017 season was CCNY's best single-season record since the 1950–51 championship team that was involved in a point-shaving scandal. Following a severe slash to the CCNY athletic department's budget, Green resigned as head coach in the summer of 2017."

        "text": "Thomas Robert Hickey (born February 8, 1989) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman who played for the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League (NHL).\nEarly life.\nHickey is a high school graduate of the Edge School in Calgary, Alberta.\nPlaying career.\nHickey joined the Seattle Thunderbirds of the Western Hockey League (WHL) in 2004–05 in a limited role for 5 games. The following season, in 2005–06, he tallied 28 points as a rookie. In his draft year, in 2006–07, Hickey improved to 9 goals and 50 points. He was then drafted in the off-season by the Los Angeles Kings in the first round, fourth overall, in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft. On July 17, 2007, he signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the Kings. Attending the Kings' training camp, he was returned to the Thunderbirds on September 21, 2007, for a third junior season. During the 2008–09 season, Hickey suffered an ankle injury that required surgery after the season. In November 2009, he suffered a shoulder injury that would also require surgery and keep him off the ice until April 1, 2010. Not much later, one game before the Monarchs would begin their playoff run for the 2009–10 season, Hickey sprained his ankle and was unable to play until the semi-finals, when the Monarchs lost to the Hershey Bears. During his time with the Monarchs, Hickey was named an alternate captain.\nOn January 15, 2013, Hickey was claimed off waivers from the Kings by the New York Islanders. He immediately joined the team during the 2012–13 training camp. He made his NHL debut with the Islanders on January 27, 2013, against the Winnipeg Jets at the MTS Centre. On February 21, 2013, Hickey scored his first NHL goal, an overtime winner against the Montreal Canadiens at the Bell Centre.\nIn the 2015–16 season, Hickey scored the overtime winner against the Washington Capitals, and with that goal the Islanders clinched a playoff spot in the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs. Just two weeks later, Hickey scored his first playoff goal in Game 3 in overtime against the Florida Panthers on a pass from Brock Nelson, giving the Islanders a 2–1 series lead. On July 1, 2018, Hickey signed a four-year contract with the Islanders.\nHeading into the 2019-20 season, having lost his spot during the season due to injury and the subsequent emergence of Devon Toews, coupled with the Islanders needing an NHL roster spot for Noah Dobson, Hickey was waived and sent to play for the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. Despite being limited to just 14 games for the Sound Tigers, Hickey was the Islanders nominee for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy in the 2019–20 season following the death of his older brother, Dan.\nHickey played out the remaining three years of his contract within the Islanders organization mostly with their AHL affiliate, the Bridgeport Islanders. During his final professional season, Hickey was loaned by the Islanders to finish his career with the Ontario Reign of the AHL, the affiliate of his original NHL club, the Los Angeles Kings.\nInternational play.\nDuring his third year of major junior, Hickey was chosen to represent Canada for the 2008 World Junior Championships in the Czech Republic, where he helped Canada to a fourth consecutive gold medal. He was selected the next year for the 2009 World Junior Championships in Ottawa as the team captain, returning with John Tavares, P. K. Subban and Zach Boychuk from the previous year's team. In the third game of preliminaries, he was chosen as Canada's player of the game in a 5–1 win against Germany. Canada went on to beat Sweden in the finals for the third straight year to capture its fifth consecutive WJHC gold medal.\nBroadcasting career.\nFollowing a 12 year professional playing career, Hickey effectively announced his retirement in joining the MSG Network's New York Islanders broadcast team on October 27, 2022.

        "text": "Patrick White (born January 20, 1989) is an American former professional ice hockey center. He last played with Ducs de Dijon in the Ligue Magnus. White previously played in North America for the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). Prior to joining the Golden Gophers, he played four seasons of high school hockey in the Minnesota State High School League with the Grand Rapids High School Thunderhawks. Although he was drafted twice by junior ice hockey teams—the Seattle Thunderbirds of the Western Hockey League (WHL) in 2004 and the Tri-City Storm of the United States Hockey League (USHL) in 2005—he chose to play for his high school instead. Described as a skilled forward with a good wrist shot, White was drafted in the first round, 25th overall by the Vancouver Canucks in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft, before being traded to the Sharks in 2009.\nPlaying career.\nGrand Rapids High School.\nWhite joined the hockey team at Grand Rapids High School when he began his education at the school. In his first season, he finished with seven points in 26 games. At the end of the season, White was drafted in the tenth round, 195th overall by the Seattle Thunderbirds of the Western Hockey League (WHL) in the 2004 WHL Bantam Draft although he declined to join the team, opting rather to continue with Grand Rapids. The next season, White greatly improved his statistics, finishing the season with 33 points in 26 games. In the offseason, he was drafted in the second round, 13th overall by the Tri-City Storm of the United States Hockey League (USHL) in the 2005 Futures Draft, although opted once again to continue with Grand Rapids.\nIn his third season with Grand Rapids, White led the team with 52 points in 30 games, earning Associated Press (AP) All-State honorable mention, \"Duluth News Tribune\" Second Team All-Area, and Iron Range All-Conference honors. He also helped Grand Rapids finish runner-up at the Minnesota State High School Boys Hockey Tournament, earning All-Tournament Team honors after finishing with five goals in three games.\nPrior to his senior season with Grand Rapids, White signed a letter of intent to play for the University of Minnesota and their Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey program following his season. In his final season at Grand Rapids, White finished scored 49 points in 30 games to be named AP Player of the Year, \"Duluth News Tribune\" Player of the Year, AP All-State First Team, St. Paul \"Pioneer Press\" All-State First Team, \"Duluth News Tribune\" First-Team All-Area, and Iron Range All-Conference. He was also a finalist for the Minnesota Mr. Hockey award, eventually losing the award to Cretin-Derham Hall High School defenseman Ryan McDonagh. Once again, he led Grand Rapids to a second-place finish at the Minnesota State High School Boys Hockey Tournament, earning All-Tournament Team honors for the second consecutive year. White also played in twelve games for the Tri-City Storm of the USHL, split before and after his high school season, scoring eight goals and one assist. Following the season, White entered the 2007 NHL Entry Draft ranked 23rd overall among North American skaters. The NHL's Central Scouting Service described White as \"a skilled forward with the ability to make a difference\" and able to get \"his wrist shot off with ease.\" He was also said adept at going into corners of the ice and fighting for the puck. On June 22, 2007, he was drafted 25th overall by the Vancouver Canucks.\nUniversity of Minnesota.\nWhite joined the University of Minnesota for the 2007–08 season. Early into his freshman season, he scored the game-winning goal against the University of Michigan in the championship game of the 2007 Ice Breaker Invitational. The goal was the first of White's college career. White finished his freshman year with ten points in 45 games while leader the Golden Gophers with a plus/minus rating of plus-nine. Furthermore, the Golden Gophers failed to lose any game in which White scored a point, earning seven wins and two ties.\nWhite's sophomore season with the Golden Gophers began as a disappointment. He did not record his first goal until the last weekend of November in the Golden Gophers' fourteenth game of the season. However, White quickly turned his play around, scoring four goals in the Golden Gophers' next ten games, including the game-winning goal 1:38 into overtime at the 2009 Dodge Holiday Classic to lead the Golden Gophers to a 3–2 victory over Northeastern University. White scored two goals in the two-game tournament, earning All-Tournament Team honors. He finished the 2009–10 season with nine goals and eight assists in thirty-nine games for the Golden Gophers.\nOn August 28, 2009, White was traded from the Canucks to the San Jose Sharks, along with fellow prospect Daniel Rahimi, in exchange for defensemen Christian Ehrhoff and Brad Lukowich. White had a career season in his third year with the Golden Gophers. He set career highs in goals, with nine, and points, with seventeen. He also tied for third on the team in goals, and tied for seventh in points.\nEurope.\nIn the following season of 2011–12 he signed with EHC Klostersee, the runner-up of season 2010–11, in the Oberliga, the third tier of ice hockey in Germany. After a year playing for Klostersee, in summer 2012 he signed a contract with the Hannover Indians where he is supposed to be a basic player in the second scoring line. The team is a part of second tier German hockey in the Bundesliga.\nIn the 2014–15 season, White began the year with HC Slovan Bratislava in the Kontinental Hockey League before he was returned on loan for a second stint with HC ’05 Banská Bystrica in the Slovak Extraliga.\nOn August 5, 2015, White signed a one-year contract as a free agent with Austrian club, Graz 99ers of the EBEL.\nInternational play.\nWhite was first exposed to international ice hockey when he represented the United States at the 2005 Under-17 Five Nations Tournament in Huttwil, Switzerland, competing against teams from the Czech Republic, Germany, Slovakia, and Switzerland. White helped the United States to first place with a record of 3–0–1, finishing the tournament with two points including an assist on the game-winning goal in the final game.\nTwo years later, White was named to the United States team for the 2007 IIHF World U18 Championships in Finland, his first International Ice Hockey Federation-sanctioned event. White scored three goals and two assists in seven games—including a two-goal performance against Latvia in which he scored the game-winning goal—as the United States lost 6–5 to Russia in the gold medal game.\nPersonal life.\nWhite was born in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. Mark, his father, played Division III college hockey at Hamline University and had experience coaching; he coached White in minor hockey, and also did work with a community college in Grand Rapids. In honor of his father, White wore the number six, the same number Mark used. While at the University of Minnesota, White pursued a management major at the Carlson School of Management."

Although he is listed as a defenceman, Smith has also played forward professionally. Smith was drafted 27th overall by the Detroit Red Wings in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft and was previously a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award.\nPlaying career.\nPrior to the 2007 Draft, Smith was a member of the Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League's St. Michael's Buzzers.

Smith made his NHL debut on November 17, 2011, against the San Jose Sharks. Smith was called up on February 27, 2012, to replace Mike Commodore, who had been traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning on the same day. He scored his first NHL goal against Josh Harding of the Minnesota Wild at the Joe Louis Arena on March 2, 2012.\nSmith appeared in 34 games for Detroit during the lock-out shortened 2012–13 NHL season. He would score his first career Stanley Cup playoff goal on May 6, 2013, during game four of Detroit's Western Conference quarterfinal series against the Anaheim Ducks.\nOn July 16, 2013, the Detroit Red Wings re-signed Smith to a two-year, $2.525 million contract. On June 30, 2015, the Red Wings re-signed Smith to a two-year, $5.5 million contract.\nDuring the final year of his contract and approaching free agency in the 2016–17 season, Smith was traded to the New York Rangers in exchange for a third-round pick in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft and a second-round pick in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft on February 28, 2017. Smith provided a stability to the Rangers blueline to finish the season with 4 points in 18 games.\nOn June 29, 2017, Smith agreed to forfeit his impending free agent status in signing to a four-year, $17.4 million contract to remain with the Rangers. On Smith reportedly showed up to 2017 training camp out of shape, and the Rangers as a team struggled. On February 8, 2018, the Rangers placed Smith on waivers due to his struggling play, and then assigned him to their AHL affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack after he went unclaimed. Shortly after arriving in Hartford, Smith broke his hand in a fight with teammate Vinni Lettieri during a practice, ending his season.\nIn the 2018 season, under new head coach David Quinn, Smith saw an improved play and fewer penalties with reduced ice time. In an effort to keep Smith in the lineup despite a crowded blue-line, Quinn dressed him as a forward several times throughout the season. Smith had previously played forward briefly while in juniors. In the 2019-20 season, Smith played exclusively as a winger before switching back to defenceman permanently after the Rangers traded Brady Skjei.\nAfter five seasons within the Rangers organization, Smith left as a free agent and on July 29, 2021, he was signed to a one-year, $800,000 contract with the Carolina Hurricanes.\nSmith left the Hurricanes at the conclusion of his contract and was signed to a two-year, $2.2 million contract with the New Jersey Devils on July 13, 2022. He scored his first goal as a Devil a year and a half into the two-year deal, in a 6–2 victory over the Ottawa Senators on December 29, 2023, when he scored on a breakaway immediately after exiting the penalty box.\nSmith would end up scoring his 2nd goal, as well as an assist, as a New Jersey Devil in their outdoor matchup against the Philadelphia Flyers in the 2024 Stadium Series at MetLife Stadium as the Devils defeated the Flyers 6-3. Smith would earn the 2nd Star of the Game for his performance.\nPersonal life.\nSmith was born and raised in Etobicoke, Ontario with his parents Deidre and Lester and his two brothers, Rory and Reilly. The three all played minor hockey in the Mimico neighbourhood with the Faustina Sports Club, then all played for the St. Michael's Buzzers minor juniors. He faced his brother Reilly in the first round of the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs when his Red Wings faced Reilly's Boston Bruins.\nSmith and his wife Samantha have a son and daughter together."

Scratches for that night's game against the Boston Bruins, the players changed their plans at the last minute and elected to return to their hotel for a nap instead. \"Sure enough I wake up from a nap and have a bunch of text messages. I turn on the TV ... it was just a twist of fate. It's definitely something that's hard to think about it. Thank goodness we didn't go\", said O'Brien."

Prior to FIU, he served as the head coach at Norfolk State University. Evans currently serves as Director of Player Development at UMass.\nEvans graduated from St. Thomas Aquinas College in 1994, where he had played guard for the men's basketball team.\nPlaying career.\nEvans played out his high school career at Bishop Loughlin High School in Brooklyn, NY. After graduating from Loughlin, he went on to attend Orange County CC in Middletown, NY where he was a two-year stand out for the Colts during the 1989–1990 &amp; 1990–1991 seasons. He currently is 4th on the SUNY Orange all-time scoring list with 1,182 points. In 2017, he was inducted into the Colt Athletic Hall of Fame. After two successful seasons, he transferred to St. Thomas Aquinas College. He served as a guard on the Spartans basketball team from 1991 to 1993, while earning his bachelor's degree in marketing.\nEarly coaching career.\nOrange County Community College.\nAnthony Evans began his coaching career at Orange County CC in Middletown, NY as an assistant from 1994 to 1997.\nUlster County Community College.\nEvans' first head coaching job was at Ulster County CC, in Kingston, NY. In the 2001 season, Evans led his squad to a 23–8 record and a runner up finish in region XV and was named Region coach of the year.\nDelhi Tech.\nFrom 2001 to 2003, Evans coached State University of New York at Delhi to a 62–8 record, including two Region III titles and appearances in the National Junior College Association Division III tournament. He was District I Coach of the Year twice, and Region III Coach of the Year in 2002. His teams at Delhi garnered a No. 1 ranking at one point during both of his years there.\nHe coached a first-team All-American in 2002–03, and an honorable-mention All-American in 2001–02. Three of his former Delhi players played at Division I schools.\nNorfolk State.\n2003–2007 seasons.\nIn 2003, Evans joined the coaching staff at Norfolk State as an assistant coach. His responsibilities included developing guards, scouting opponents and recruiting. Evans was instrumental in the recruitment of several of NSU's top players. Included among them was a pair of 1,000-point scorers and All-MEAC players, guards Tony Murphy and Corey Lyons. Murphy became the school's first three-time All-MEAC player and departed as the program's No. 7 all-time leading scorer.\nMurphy and Lyons are just two of the players who have earned conference accolades during Evans’ tenure at NSU. Murphy and fellow guard Michael Deloach were both two-time All-MEAC members during their careers. O’Quinn earned three all-conference designations during his career and also earned NABC All-District honors in 2010–11. Also in 2011–12, senior Chris McEachin was voted to the All-MEAC second team.\nAfter four seasons as an assistant, Evans took over the head coaching job at Norfolk State.\n2007–08 season.\nIn 2007–08, his first at the helm of the program, Evans guided the Spartans to just their second Division I winning season. The Spartans compiled a 16–15 overall record and finished 11–5 in MEAC play, at the time their most successful regular-season finish since joining the league. NSU also tied for second in the regular-season standings, another high-water mark for the program. NSU advanced to the MEAC tournament semifinals before losing to eventual champion Coppin State. Evans capped his inaugural season by being named MEAC Co-Coach of the Year by CollegeInsider.com\n2008–09 season.\nIn 2008–09, NSU shook off a slow start to reach the cusp of its first-ever MEAC title. The Spartans rode an up-tempo offense and pressure defense to their first MEAC tournament championship game appearance. Despite falling to Morgan State in the tournament final, the Spartans served notice that they deserve to be mentioned among the conference's elite.\n2009–2011 seasons.\nThe 2009–10 Spartans finished the year at 9–7 in conference play. And in 2010–11, the Spartans advanced to the MEAC tournament semifinals for the third time in four seasons.\n2011–12 season.\nThe 26–10 campaign in 2011–12 now stands as the best record ever for NSU during the D-I years, as does the Spartans’ 13–3 conference record. It marked the most overall wins since the 1994–95 season and the most conference victories since 1995–96. In addition, it kept alive NSU's streak of finishing .500 or better in conference play, a streak that began in 1991–92 and includes every year in the MEAC except for a first-season transitional year.\nA senior-led squad defeated Howard, Florida A&amp;M and then Bethune-Cookman, 73–70, at the 2012 MEAC Championship to capture the first-ever conference title for the men's program since moving into the MEAC and Division I in 1997. NSU was not done, though, as the No. 15 seed Spartans pulled off one of the biggest upsets ever in NCAA tournament history just six days later.\nFacing No. 2 seed Missouri – a team several experts believed would advance to the Final Four and could have been a No. 1 seed – in a West Region matchup on March 16, NSU used its size advantage and a huge game from senior center Kyle O’Quinn to shock the Tigers and the nation in an 86–84 upset in the NCAA second round.\nThe Spartans became the fifth No. 15 seed (at the time) to defeat a No. 2 seed and the third MEAC school to accomplish the feat. No. 3-ranked Missouri became the highest ranked team to ever lose its first game of an NCAA tournament since the field expanded to 64. The victory over the Big 12 tournament champion Tigers was nominated for “Best Upset” at the 2012 ESPY Awards.\nLater on in the summer of 2012, O’Quinn, an unheralded high school player from Queens, New York, whose only D-I scholarship offer was from NSU, was selected by the Orlando Magic with the 49th overall pick in the NBA draft. No Spartan basketball player had been drafted since 1988, and no MEAC player had heard his name called either since 1998.\nEvans won several awards. He was named the MEAC tournament's Most Outstanding Coach and!the Clarence “Big House” Gaines Award winner, given out by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association to the top minority basketball coach in Division I.\nHe also earned HBCU Coach of the Year honors from Boxtorow.com, and Virginia Sports Information Directors (VaSID) Coach of the Year accolades.\nAs a result of the team's success, Evans, who was in his 10th year overall on the Spartan coaching staff, was rewarded with a contract extension in June 2012 that will keep him with NSU through the 2016–17 season.\n2012–13 season.\nEvans guided the Spartans to a 21–12 overall record, including a perfect 16–0 mark in MEAC play, but lost its conference tournament opener to Bethune-Cookman. By virtue of winning the conference regular season, Norfolk State earned a bid to the 2013 NIT where it faced Virginia in the opening round, losing 67–56.\nFIU.\nOn April 15, 2013, Evans accepted the job at Florida International, replacing Richard Pitino.\nOn April 2, 2018, FIU parted ways with Evans after five seasons."

Cornell completed a second undefeated season, becoming the first team to win back-to-back championships. \nThe championship game was played at Scott Stadium at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia, with 10,080 fans in attendance.\nOverview.\nLed for the second straight year by Coach Richard M. Moran and USILA most outstanding player winner Eamon McEneaney, Cornell capped off a 13–0 season with a 16–8 victory over Johns Hopkins in the finals. McEneaney scored three goals and assisted on five others, while Hall of Famer Dan Mackesey was a solid in goal with 14 saves. Cornell opened with an 9–0 lead in the first 20 minutes and led by as many as 13–1 early in the second half of the finals.\nThe victory was the 29th straight for Cornell and marked their third title in seven NCAA tournaments. Cornell would not lose again until the following year's championship game again versus Johns Hopkins. Both of Hopkins' losses during the season were to Cornell, and McEneaney had 25 total points during the tournament eclipsing the prior record of 20 set by Mike French in 1976.\nCoach Moran earned his second Morris Touchstone Award as the Division I Coach of the Year, while Eamon McEneaney won the Lt. Raymond Enners Award as the most outstanding player in the nation and Chris Kane wins the Schmeisser Cup as the nation's outstanding defenseman. Dan Mackesey repeated as the winner of the Ens. C.M. Kelly, Jr. Award as the nation's most outstanding goaltender, making it the fifth time in a 10-year span that a Big Red player had received the award.\nEamon McEneaney was voted the outstanding player in the 1977 NCAA tournament and also represented the United States in the 1978 World Lacrosse Championships. He was inducted into the Cornell Sports Hall of Fame in 1982. McEneaney was inducted into the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1992. McEneaney teamed with Hall of Fame players Mike French, Dan Mackesey, Bill Marino, Bob Hendrickson, and Chris Kane, and coach Richie Moran to lead the Cornell Big Red to the NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship in 1976 and 1977. His top season was 1975 when he scored 31 goals and handed out 65 assists for 96 total points in 17 games, and was named the USILA player of the year. That year, he was also awarded the Turnbull Award given to the top collegiate attackman. His career was played in an era when freshmen were not eligible to play varsity sports. He was also an outstanding football player, playing wide receiver. He was named to the All-Ivy second team in 1976, when he led Cornell in receiving and was second in team scoring. In 1995, he was named to the NCAA's Silver Anniversary Lacrosse Team, recognizing his place among the best players of the first quarter century of NCAA lacrosse. McEneaney was a 9-11 victim and his jersey number (#10) was retired by Cornell University on April 27, 2002 in memoriam."

Plus, he was always twitching his neck and his jaw and contorting his face. He always swore he had a broken jaw. And he was constantly socking himself in the mouth to try to straighten it out. I swear to God, he'd haul off every few hours and punch himself as hard as he could right in the face. He acted like a true psycho. And he was a big guy, about six-three and 270.\" Donovan went on to describe how Winkler once refused to play in a game against the Rams because they were his former teammates. Another anecdote describes a time when Winkler got a scratch on his face during a practice. When teammate Ken Jackson joked that Winkler's face needed stitches, Winkler took him seriously and went ballistic after team trainer Eddie Block told him that it was really only a scratch and did not require stitches. He started destroying the locker room and was sent home.\nAn article in the July 25, 1954 issue of \"The Baltimore Sun\" acknowledged that Winkler experienced personal problems in his lone season with the Colts but stated that Winkler asked Coach Weeb Ewbank for his release due to a shoulder injury. It also stated that he returned to Texas to live with his father, his wife, and his child."

        "title": "2007 World Series of Poker results",
        "text": "The 2007 World Series of Poker was the 38th annual World Series of Poker (WSOP). Held in Las Vegas, Nevada at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino, the series featured 55 poker championships in several variants. As a WSOP custom since 1976, each of the event winners receive a championship bracelet in addition to that event's prize money. The series culminates with the $10,000 No-Limit hold'em \"Main Event\", which has attracted thousands of entrants since 2004. The winner of the WSOP Main Event, who wins a multimillion-dollar prize, is considered to be the World Champion of Poker.\nMost of the tournaments played at the WSOP are variants of Texas hold'em, a game where each player may use a combination of the five community cards and two hole cards to make the best hand. Another poker variant with community cards is Omaha, in which each player is dealt four hole cards and must use two of them in conjunction with three of the five community cards to make the best possible five-card hand. In contrast to games with community cards, some variants, such as stud or draw, deal each player separate hands with no common cards. Seven-card stud deals each player two hole cards, followed by four face-up cards one at a time, and then another hidden card, with betting after each round. Other games played at the 2007 tournament included Razz, H.O.R.S.E., and Deuce-to-Seven. Prior to 2000, seven-card stud was the most common game in U.S. casinos, but today hold'em has almost totally eclipsed the once popular game.\nWithin each of these poker variants, a myriad of options exist. For example, depending on the betting structure, a tournament might be described as no-limit, limit, or pot-limit. Games may include other variations on the rules governing the execution of the specific game such as shootout, eight or better, or heads up.\nWith 54,288 total entries and a combined prize pool of $159,796,918, the 2007 WSOP was the largest series of poker tournaments ever. For many, winning a share of the prize pool was all that mattered, while others sought the glory associated with winning a bracelet. This dichotomy could not have been illustrated better than a deal negotiated at the Senior Championship event. Tony Korfman wanted the money while Ernest Bennett wanted the glory. Rather than leave their fates to chance, the two of them ensured they got what they wanted. In exchange for splitting the prize money, Korfman agreed to let Bennett win the bracelet. After winning $8.25 million in the Main Event, Jerry Yang and his wife retired. \"My winning today also means a lot to me, because I know that I can use this money to do a lot of good for other people out there,\" Yang said before donating over a million dollars to charity. Upon winning his record eleventh bracelet, Phil Hellmuth said, \"the bracelets have always been a really huge deal, to me more than the other guys, because I knew that they represented history.\"\nAge and disability was another story line of the 2007 WSOP. At 21 years and 10 days old, Steve Billirakis became the youngest person to ever win a WSOP bracelet. At the other end of the spectrum, 94-year-old Jack Ury was the oldest person to ever participate in the Main Event. Hal Lubarsky, a blind man, finished in 197th place at the Main Event.\nResults.\nEvent 1: $5,000 World Championship Mixed hold'em Limit/No-Limit.\nThis event kicked off the 2007 WSOP. It was a $ buy-in Mixed (alternating between limit and no-limit) Texas Hold'em tournament.\nEvent 2: $500 Casino Employees No-Limit Hold'em.\nThis was a $ buy-in no-limit Texas Hold'em tournament reserved for casino employees that work in Nevada.\nEvent 3: $1,500 No-Limit Hold’em.\nEvent 3 was the largest non-Main Event live tournament in history. This record, however, would be short lived as event 49 would break that record.\nEvent 9: $1,500 Omaha Hi-Low Split-8 or Better.\nNinth-place finisher Richard Ashby was eliminated simultaneously along with Ron Ware (10th place) on the final hand of day, 2 by Jordan Morgan. Therefore, he never appeared at the official final table.\nEvent 12: $1,500 No-Limit Hold'em (6-handed).\nThis event was played in a shorthanded format, no more than six players per table, with no more than six players occupying a table at any time during the tournament.\nEvent 15: $1,500 No-Limit Hold'em.\nPhil Hellmuth won his eleventh WSOP bracelet, the most of any player. He was previously one of three players with ten bracelets the others being Johnny Chan and Doyle Brunson.\nEvent 16: $2,500 H.O.R.S.E..\nRazz is a form of stud poker that is normally played for ace-to-five low (lowball poker). The object of Razz is to make the lowest five-card possible hand from the seven cards you are dealt. In Razz, straights and flushes do not count against you for low, and the ace always plays low. The best possible Razz hand is 5-4-3-2-A, or 5 high, also known as \"the wheel\" or \"the bicycle\". Deuce-to-seven Razz is also sometimes played.\nEvent 17: $1,000 World Championship Ladies No-Limit Hold'em.\nThe 1,286 entrants made this the largest ladies only tournament ever.\nEvent 18: $5,000 World Championship Limit Hold'em.\nLike David Williams, Gabriel Nassif was first known for competing .\nEvent 31: $5,000 World Championship Heads-Up No-Limit Hold'em.\n\"SF\" denotes players who lost in the semifinal round of the tournament and \"QF\" denotes players who lost in the quarterfinal round.\nEvent 39: $50,000 World Championship H.O.R.S.E..\nThe $7.1 million prize pool and $2.2 million prize were the largest prizes in poker history for a non-Main WSOP event.\nEvent 41: $1,000 World Championship Seniors No-Limit Hold'em.\nBennett and Korfman made a deal before heads-up play began. Korfman agreed to let Bennett win the title uncontested if Bennett agreed to split the prize money. They split the cash evenly with each taking home roughly $293,000. With 1,882 entrants over the age of 55, this was the largest Senior's event ever.\nEvent 49: $1,500 No-Limit Hold'em.\nThis event set a World Series of Poker non-main event and live poker attendance record with 3,151 entries breaking the previous record of 2,998 set earlier in the third event of the 2007 WSOP. At the time it was also the third-highest entry total in all live Poker events behind just the 2006 and 2005 main events which had 8,773 and 5,619 entrants respectively.\nEvent 55: $10,000 World Championship No-Limit Hold'em.\nAs the final event, in which the \"World Champion of Poker\" is crowned, this is considered the \"Main Event\"."

        "text": "Jack Matthews (21 June 1920 – 18 July 2012) was a Welsh physician and rugby union international centre who played first-class club rugby for Cardiff and Newport. Along with Bleddyn Williams, Matthews formed a centre partnership which is regarded as one of the finest in the game. He was also a devastating tackler, once described as \"a cross between a bulldozer and a brick wall\".\nMatthews won 17 caps for Wales and six with the British Lions, though his career was curtailed by the Second World War. Matthews was a general practitioner by profession and travelled with the 1980 Lions on their tour of South Africa as the team doctor.\nEarly history.\nBorn in Bridgend, South Wales in 1920, Matthews attended Bridgend County School before matriculating to the Welsh National School of Medicine. From a youth he was a keen sportsperson, and in 1937 he won the Welsh AAA junior 220 yards title. A year later, after spending three seasons in the Welsh Secondary Schools rugby team, he played in a senior Wales trial, at just eighteen years old. In 1939 he came second in the Senior Men's AAA 100 yards and third in the 220 yards.\nSecond World War.\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War, Matthews applied to join the Royal Air Force, but was required to train as a doctor at the Welsh School of Medicine. Matthews was later commissioned into the Royal Army Medical Corps. Bleddyn Williams, an RAF trainee and later Matthew's centre partner for Wales, played with Matthews for the first time whilst stationed in South Wales. The duo were part of a South Wales team that faced an Ack Ack XV in 1942. Williams was later switched to and trained as a glider pilot, attached to the Glider Pilot Regiment.\nWhilst stationed at RAF St Athan air base in the Vale of Glamorgan in 1943, Matthews fought future world champion Rocky Marciano in an amateur boxing match. Marciano famously ended his career having won every professional match he fought in, but Matthews held him to a draw in a 4 rounder.\nRugby career.\nBefore winning his first cap, Matthews took part in five Victory Internationals for Wales, including the win over France in which he was captain. Matthews played 17 Tests for Wales and six for the British &amp; Irish Lions on their 1950 tour of New Zealand and Australia. He was the team doctor for the 1980 British Lions tour to South Africa, and was a medical doctor by profession. Matthews played centre for Wales and Cardiff – forming one of the greatest midfield pairings Wales has ever had with Bleddyn Williams.\nPersonal life.\nAfter the war, Matthews married Valerie and the couple went on to have two sons, Peter and Robin. Valerie died in 1996.\nLater life.\nMatthews continued his connection with sport after retiring from playing rugby. He maintained links with boxing, becoming the medical officer to the Welsh Boxing Association. He was also chosen to be the medical doctor for the 1980 British Lions tour of South Africa.\nDespite his close links with rugby, Matthews showed an uncompromising stance in his views on how the game should be played. In 2004, he publicly criticised Sir Clive Woodward's coaching methods before the 2005 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. In the 1981 Birthday Honours, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to rugby football.\nIn 2009, Matthews suffered a severe stroke that left him speechless. He died in July 2012, aged 92."

        "text": "The American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA) is an organization of over 9,000 members, incorporated as a private non-profit educational corporation in 1981, as the Collegiate Volleyball Coaches Association. It is currently headquartered in Lexington, Kentucky.\nThe original members of the AVCA were intercollegiate coaches who banded together to form this particular coaching body. In 1986, during the San Francisco convention, the membership recognized the growing and developing high school and club communities. The name of the association was then changed to reflect these growing constituencies. The original Collegiate Volleyball Coaches Association was renamed the American Volleyball Coaches Association with the intent of responding to and serving all volleyball coaches.\nThe organization also produces a weekly national poll for collegiate volleyball similar to how the Associated Press makes a poll for NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision.\nHistory.\nAlthough incorporated as a non-profit in 1981, the AVCA began to grow and diversify, and a full-time executive director wasn't hired until July 1983. An associate director was hired in April 1986 and an administrative assistant in September 1988.\nThe Association moved from San Mateo, California, to Colorado Springs, Colorado, in August 1992. The staff has increased to the following positions: executive director, assistant executive director, director of operations, assistant director of events and public relations, manager of awards and membership, manager of communications, sales manager, and awards and membership specialist.\nIn 1986, the board was increased to 13 members, due to new membership increases averaging out at about 150 per year. In 1988, a boom of 106% new memberships occurred. Since 1986, high school membership has more than tripled. The AVCA has members in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, as well as, numerous international members. At the collegiate level, all major NCAA conferences are represented and membership among the club coaches has risen dramatically.\nIn July 2006 the association moved its headquarters to Lexington, Kentucky and entered into an association management partnership with Associations International (formally Host Communications then IMG College). The current president of the AVCA is Keegan Cook (head coach - University of Minnesota). The Chief Executive Officer is Dr. Jaime Gordon and the Chief Operating Officer is Jason Jones.\nAVCA events.\nBeach volleyball championship.\nThe beach volleyball championship was introduced to the women's collegiate scene by CBS College Sports with the Collegiate Nationals, an event founded by the network in the spring of 2006 to broadcast the national championships of several \"action sports.\" The event was sponsored by the CBS College Sports Network, American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA) and the Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP).\nIn 2006, the AVP sanctioned a combine that selected 8 players from 8 colleges and paired them into teams (title was won by Bibiana Candelas (USC)/Paula Gentil (Minnesota)). In 2007 Nebraska (Jordan Larson/Sarah Pavan) won an invitational competition of 8 colleges, which featured only two players per school, as opposed to entire teams. 2008 saw Texas win an invitational, sponsored by AVCA and AVP, involving 6 schools with four doubles squads each. In 2009, USC prevailed over an invited field of 8 colleges with four doubles squads each. In 2010, the competition reverted to one doubles squad per school, with 12 colleges invited; it was won by Loyola Marymount (Emily Day/Heather Hughes).

He played college football for Baylor University.\nEarly years.\nDickson attended Waco High School before moving on to Baylor University, where he became a two-way right tackle and a two-year starter. As a sophomore, he was a part of the upset win (13-7) against the University of Tennessee in the 1957 Sugar Bowl.\nProfessional career.\nLos Angeles Rams.\nDickson was selected by the Los Angeles Rams in the first round (9th overall) of the 1959 NFL Draft. The Rams used him as a backup offensive tackle. He was waived on September 13, 1960.\nDallas Cowboys.\nOn September 14, 1960, Dickson was claimed off waivers by the Dallas Cowboys and played as an offensive right tackle (8 starts).\nThe Cowboys traded its first round draft choice in the 1961 NFL Draft, as part of the deal to get Eddie LeBaron from the Washington Redskins, so on December 27, 1960, he was traded along with a first round pick (#4-Gary Collins) in the 1962 NFL Draft, in exchange for the Cleveland Browns first round draft choice (13th overall) in 1961, in order to select future hall of famer Bob Lilly, the first draft choice in Cowboys franchise history.\nCleveland Browns.\nOn September 12, 1961, the Cleveland Browns traded him along with Jim Marshall, Jim Prestel, Dick Grecni, Jamie Caleb and Billy Gault, to the Minnesota Vikings in exchange for a second-round choice (#17-Chuck Hinton) and an eleventh-round pick (#142-Ronnie Meyers).\nMinnesota Vikings.\nIn 1961, Dickson was one of the original players in the Minnesota Vikings inaugural season. Following the trade, he was switched from right offensive tackle to defensive tackle - a position he would play for the rest of his career. In practice, he was known for playing at full-speed, much to the irritation of his teammates on the offensive side of the ball. He was the regular starter at right defensive tackle and a key player from 1962 to 1967.\nIn 1968, he was passed on the depth chart by future hall of famer Alan Page. The next year, although he was a backup, he was still considered a part of the Vikings' famous \"Purple People Eaters\" or \"The Four Norsemen\" defensive line, which consisted mainly of Marshall (DE), Page (DT), Gary Larsen (DT), and Carl Eller (DE). He played in Super Bowl IV at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans, Louisiana, losing to the Kansas City Chiefs.\nIn 1971, he spent time on the team's taxi squad before being released.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nOn November 10, 1971, he was claimed off waivers by the St. Louis Cardinals, where he was reunited with his former defensive line coach with the Vikings, Bob Hollway, then in his first season as Cardinals head coach. He Joined the team on November 20, after reconsidering his retirement decision. He was cut during the 1972 training camp.\nChicago Bears.\nOn May 3, 1972, he was claimed off waivers by the Chicago Bears, but was released before the start of the season.\nPersonal life.\nDickson returned to Minneapolis, after his one season in St. Louis, to live and work in sales, marketing and customer relations for computer companies. He was also a member and president of the Minnesota chapter of the NFL Alumni Association. He was nicknamed \"Suitcase\" because of his large hands and feet.\nIn January 1971, he joined Viking teammate Marshall in a snowmobile excursion that ended in tragedy. Planning to travel across the Great Divide of the Rocky Mountains, a party of 16 became fragmented, and then got caught in a blizzard, having to spend a frigid night in the snow with few provisions. Dickson, Marshall and three others huddled together in a grove of trees, and lit all the cash they had on them -- \"Hundreds, twenties, ones, they were all the same denomination: burnable,\" Marshall said—in order to start a small fire to avoid freezing. Although everyone was rescued the next day, Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Hugh Galusha died of hypothermia.\nOn June 7, 2011, he died of a blood infection. He was survived by his second wife Maureen and his two sons Scott and Slade from his first marriage."

        "text": "Brian Francis O'Neill (January 25, 1929 – July 21, 2023) was a Canadian sports executive who worked for the National Hockey League (NHL), reaching the level of executive vice president. O'Neill oversaw the NHL's expansion draft in 1967 and later looked after the NHL Entry Draft until he took over as executive vice-president after NHL president Clarence Campbell stepped down in 1977. With this new position, he doled out punishment on any disciplinary cases. He would also represent the league on the international front. He retired from his position with the NHL in 1992, concurrently with NHL president John Ziegler.\nEarly life.\nO'Neill was born on January 25, 1929, and raised in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He played hockey growing up and attended Loyola College for his Bachelor of Arts degree. Upon graduating, he earned his Bachelor of Commerce degree in economics at McGill University while playing ice hockey for the McGill Redbirds.\nCareer.\nUpon graduating from McGill, O'Neill spent 10 years with a Canadian business magazine and managed Wallace Publishing Company. In 1962, he was appointed business manager of the \"Financial Times\". In 1966, O'Neill was selected by Clarence Campbell to be his assistant manager with the eventual goal of succeeding him as president of the National Hockey League (NHL). While serving in this role, he was in charge of creating the season's schedule for the 1967 NHL expansion season. O'Neill organized the schedule in a way that allowed 444 games to be played in arenas within a span of 25 weeks in 12 cities as far as 2,704 miles apart. By 1971, he was appointed an executive director of the league and helped organize the NHL Amateur Draft. Beyond the draft, O'Neill used his position as executive director to promote a reduction in violent play on the ice, which he deemed \"hooliganism\".\nAfter Campbell retired in 1977, O'Neill was named the NHL's executive vice-president and took over all player disciplinary cases. During his first few months in the position, he advocated for harsher penalties for dangerous plays on the ice which result in injury. When explaining his reasons for increased forms of discipline, O'Neill said: \"Every penalty handed down serves two purposes. One is to penalize the player. The second is to act as a deterrent. If the message does not get across, then you have to increase the severity of the penalty. And that has been the case between now and, say, 10 years ago. There's been an inflationary factor to it.\" His management of disciplinary cases was met with criticism from players across the league, including Mike Bossy who said O'Neill had a conflict of interest as he was employed by the owners to punish the owners' employees. He argued that this was the reason for a lack of suspensions under O'Neill's rule.\nOn August 25, 1992, O'Neill officially stepped down from his position as executive vice-president. Prior to O'Neill's retiring, President-elect Gil Stein said: \"the suspensions and drawn-out hearings which marked O'Neill's policing of the NHL had to go.\" Stein's critiques of O'Neill was met with criticism from the media, including from Michael Farber of the \"Montreal Gazette\" who wrote: \"O'Neill treats the hockey public with more respect than Stein treated him.\"\nLater life.\nAfter the death of Red Dutton in 1987, O'Neill became a trustee for the Stanley Cup. In 1994, O'Neill was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame.\nO'Neill died in Montreal on July 21, 2023, at age 94."

        "text": "The men's foil was a competition in fencing at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. A total of 36 men from 20 nations competed in this event. Nations had been limited to three fencers each since 1928. Competition took place in the Fencing Hall at the Helliniko Olympic Complex on August 16. The event was won by Brice Guyart of France, the nation's ninth victory in the men's foil (surpassing Italy for most all-time). Italy took the other two medals, with Salvatore Sanzo earning silver and Andrea Cassarà winning the bronze medal match.\nBackground.\nThis was the 24th appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1908 (when there was a foil display only rather than a medal event). Two of the eight quarterfinalists from 2000 returned: silver medalist Ralf Bißdorf of Germany and fifth-place finisher Salvatore Sanzo of Italy. Sanzo had won the 2001 world championship, and his teammate Simone Vanni the 2002 title. The reigning (2003) world champion was Peter Joppich of Germany.\nFor the second consecutive Games, no nations made their debut in the men's foil. France and the United States each made their 22nd appearance, tied for most of any nation; France had missed only the 1904 (with fencers not traveling to St. Louis) and the 1912 (boycotted due to a dispute over rules) foil competitions, while the United States had missed the inaugural 1896 competition and boycotted the 1980 Games altogether.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1996 tournament had vastly simplified the competition format into a single-elimination bracket, with a bronze medal match. The 2004 tournament continued to use that format. Bouts were to 15 touches. Standard foil rules regarding target area, striking, and priority were used.\nResults.\nPreliminary round.\nAs there were more than 32 entrants in this event, four first round matches were held to reduce the field to 32 fencers.\nMain tournament bracket.\nThe remaining field of 32 fencers competed in a single-elimination tournament to determine the medal winners. Semifinal losers proceeded to a bronze medal match."

As opposed to \"The Wraith: Shangri-La\", which focused on the positive aspects of life and death, \"Hell's Pit\" focuses on darker subject matter such as hell, murder and psychosis. As produced by Esham, \"Bowling Balls\" was intended as a throwback to the latter half of \"Carnival of Carnage\", which featured a dark, modest sound. \"Bowling Balls\" samples the drum beat of Madonna's \"Justify My Love,\" which was based upon Public Enemy's instrumental \"Security of the First World\", which was in turn based on the end drum break of James Brown's \"Funky Drummer\". A remix of the song was produced by Monoxide of Twiztid; it appeared on the remix album '.\nFilm.\nIn promotion of the song and album, Psychopathic Video produced a short film of the same name based around the song, directed by Paul Andresen. A long form music video and comedy horror film, \"Bowling Balls\" was the first 3-D film to be shot in high-definition video.

Rather than sit in an old broken down truck in the middle of nowhere while they wait for their friends to come pick them up, they decide to go with J (Violent J), a clown, who invites them to his bed and breakfast. However, J's ulterior motives are revealed when his retarded hunchback brother, Shaggy (Shaggy 2 Dope), decapitates one of the girls.

        "title": "Baseball in Israel",
        "text": "In Israel, there are approximately 1,000 baseball players in 16 cities across the country. Volunteer coaches and donors are instrumental to the growth and development of the sport, as baseball resources are very low. The Israel Association of Baseball (IAB) is the governing body of the sport. As of the end of 2023, Israel was ranked 19th in the world in the sport. The country was one of six nations to qualify for baseball at the 2020 Summer Olympics, finishing fifth in the tournament.\nHistory.\nBaseball was first played in the British Mandate of Palestine on July 4, 1927. The first field in Israel was built in Kibbutz Gezer in 1979, and the country now has a baseball field at the Yarkon Sports Complex in Petach Tikva. Israel sends national teams of various age groups to international baseball tournaments each year. The best recent showing to date in International Play (Pool A) was a 1st place by the Israeli Juvenile (ages 10–12) in the 2009 European Championships (CEB). Between 500 and 1,000 Israelis regularly play baseball in amateur league play. Baseball is growing at an accelerated pace, with much greater baseball identity associated with the country.\nDean Kremer was the first Israeli to be selected in the Major League Baseball draft (MLB draft), when he was selected by the San Diego Padres in the 2015 MLB draft. However, he opted to play college baseball for the UNLV Rebels, with whom he had three years of remaining eligibility, with the plan of playing professionally after college. In the 2016 MLB draft, Kremer was picked in the 14th round by the Los Angeles Dodgers, 431st overall. His was signed by the Dodgers organization, and made his professional debut that season with the Ogden Raptors of the Pioneer Baseball League. Kremer made his MLB debut in 2020 with the Baltimore Orioles.\nBallparks.\nThere are three main ballparks in Israel:\nIn January 2017, the roster of Team Israel traveled to Beit Shemesh to participate in the ground-breaking ceremony for the first-ever dedicated baseball field in Israel. The field was expected to take approximately 2–3 months to design, and be available for use by the end of 2017.\nOrganization.\nIsrael Association of Baseball.\nThe Israel Association of Baseball (IAB), established in 1986, founded by Randy Kahn, is a non-profit organization in Israel. Their goal is to promote and develop baseball in Israel. In order to accomplish this they teach baseball to youth, organize national tournaments as well as aid in assisting Israeli teams to compete internationally, and procuring the required equipment. Additionally they will help organize the league, ensure they have a proper field, train the coaches, umpires and player.\nThe IAB is a member of The Olympic Committee of Israel, the Confederation of European Baseball, and the International Baseball Association. The above organization in addition to the Israel Sports Authority, recognizes the IAB as the sole governing body for baseball in Israel.\nNotable players to play in the IAB include Alon Leichman and Dean Kremer.\nThe following clubs are registered to participate in the IAB; these are mostly youth clubs (Senior teams have a star next to their name:)\nIsrael Baseball Academy.\nUnder the authority of the IAB the Israel Baseball Academy launched in October 2014. The first year's program started in mid-October at Yarkon Sports Complex in Petah Tikva.\nAcademy players will partake in weekly training. This will give them the opportunities to play in the Israel National Team Program, to be recognized as Elite Athletes in the IDF. The program is also recognized by Major League Baseball and will give them access to programs designed for the best young players in Europe.\nFormer IAB National Director Nate Fish and National Team Coach David Schenker were the first coaches for the academy. Dan Rothem, a former college pitcher and Israel National Team player will be the pitching coach. Each year the program plans to include 10 kids age 14-21. In addition to the first year's participants there are 20 kids which are being scouted for year two.\nThere are currently 24 players aged 14–18 in the Israel Baseball Academy. National Coach, Ryan Willen, a former catcher at division 3 Washington &amp; Jefferson College runs the Academy. Additionally, former Japanese professional coach and player by the nickname of \"KAZ\" assists in operating and maintaining the high-level product offered to the nations best players.\nIsrael Baseball League.\nIn 2007, the Israel Baseball League played its one and only season. The six league teams were the Tel Aviv Lightning, Netanya Tigers, Bet Shemesh Blue Sox, Petach Tikva Pioneers, Modi'in Miracle, and Ra'anana Express. All the league's games were played at three ballparks. The Yarkon Sports Complex, Gezer Field, and Sportek Baseball Field.\nIn November 2007 it was announced that a new six-team league, the Israel Professional Baseball League, was taking shape, and would play its first season in 2008. Those behind the new league included billionaire Jeffrey Rosen, a major IBL investor who also owns the Maccabi Haifa basketball team, which he bought in the summer of 2007, and is the chairman of Triangle Financial Services of Aventura, Florida; Andrew Wilson, who was a facilitator on the ground for the IBL and now works for Rosen; Alan Gardner, a lawyer from New York, who was the centerfielder for the Bet Shemesh Blue Sox; and Michael Rollhaus, a businessman from Queens and major IBL investor.\nWorld Baseball Classic.\n2013 Tournament.\nIsrael, was placed in the Qualifier 1 bracket with Spain, South Africa and France.\nIsrael competed in their first qualifying match for the 2013 tournament on 19 September 2012. In this game they defeated South Africa by a score of 7–3. Nate Freiman had two home runs in the victory.\nIsrael's second qualifying match was against Spain on 21 September 2012. Israel won the game by a score of 4-2. Nate Freiman once again homered twice for Israel in the victory.\nIsrael's third qualifying match was once again against Spain on 23 September 2012. Israel lost this game by a score of 9-7 in 10 innings. With the victory Israel was eliminated from the tournament and Spain moved on to the next round. Although Israel had won their first two games they were eliminated due to the tournaments modified double-elimination format. This meant that the final game was winner-take-all.\n2017 Tournament.\nIn September 2016, Israel competed in the 2017 Qualifier 4 round. Colorado Rockies coach Jerry Weinstein served as the manager. Israel's roster included 20 MLB-affiliated minor leaguers, making up 86% of the team, more than any other team in the qualifiers even before including recent Major Leaguers.\nIsrael won all three of their games in the qualifier, beating Great Britain twice and Brazil once. With the win, Israel will play in Pool A in South Korea in March 2017, against South Korea, Taiwan, and Netherlands. In the first round, Israel again swept the round, to advance to the second round in Pool E.\n2023 Tournament.\nTeam Israel will compete in the 2023 World Baseball Classic in March 12-15, 2023. It will play in Miami, Florida. Israel will face Team Puerto Rico, Team Dominican Republic, and Team Venezuela.\nEuropean Baseball Championship.\nTeam Israel first competed in the European Baseball Championship in 2019; their best finish has been second place, achieved in 2021.\n2019 Tournament.\nTeam Israel won the 2019 European Baseball Championship - B-Pool in early July 2019 in Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria, winning all five of its games. It thus advanced to the playoffs against Team Lithuania in the 2019 Playoff Series at the end of July 2019 for the last qualifying spot for the 2019 European Baseball Championship. Israel won the best-of-three playoff series 2–0, and thereby qualified for the main tournament.\nIn Round 1 of the 2019 European Baseball Championship, Israel went 4–1. The team thereby advanced to the Championship's eight-team playoffs. In the Championship playoffs, Israel defeated Team France in the quarterfinals, lost to Team Italy in the semi-finals, and finished in fourth place for the tournament.\n2021 Tournament.\nTeam Israel was runner-up of the 2021 European Baseball Championship, losing 9–4 in the championship game to Team Netherlands.\n2023 Tournament.\nTeam Israel finished in sixth place of the 2023 European Baseball Championship, having played to a 3–3 record during the tournament.\nSummer Olympics.\n2020 Olympics qualifiers Africa/Europe Qualifying Event.\nThe Israeli team started strong at the September 2019 Africa/Europe Qualifying Event, by defeating all three 2019 European Baseball Championship medalists - world # 8 Netherlands, world # 16 Italy, and Spain, before losing to the Czech Republic. In its final game, Israel beat South Africa 11–1 in a game that was stopped in the 7th inning due to the mercy rule. Team Israel won the tournament with a 4–1 record. It thereby qualified to be one of six national baseball teams that competed in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. First baseman/DH Danny Valencia batted .375 and led the tournament in runs (7), home runs (3), RBIs (9), walks (5), and slugging percentage (1.000), and starting pitcher Joey Wagman tied for the tournament lead with two wins, and led in complete games (1) and strikeouts (14) as he had an 0.56 ERA in 16 innings.\nEvery member of the 24-member Team Israel that competed to qualify in the Olympics was Israeli, with four of the players native-born. The others made \"aliyah\" to Israel, under Israel's Law of Return, which gives anyone with a Jewish parent or grandparent or who is married to a Jew the right to return to Israel and be granted Israeli citizenship. Native-born Israeli team member Shlomo Lipetz observed: \"There is no other country like Israel that carries an identity as it does with Jews around the world. We’re not the only team here with citizens that don't live in the country. There were other teams like Spain that had 22 Venezuelans and two Spaniards. But they didn't have that connection. This wasn't just a group of people, All-Stars who came together. It was people who all had a Bar Mitzvah. We were joking around that everyone will post their Bar Mitzvah photo.\"\n2020 Summer Olympics.\nAt the 2020 Summer Olympics, held in Tokyo in the summer of 2021, Israel beat Mexico and finished fifth after going 1–4 and losing to the Dominican Republic 7–6 in the Round 2 Repechage. Danny Valencia tied for the lead in the Olympics with three home runs, tied for second with six runs and seven RBIs, and had the fourth-best slugging percentage (.778), Ryan Lavarnway had the 5th-best slugging percentage (.700), and Mitch Glasser's .474 on base percentage was 5th-best at the Games."

He won a silver medal in 1985. Boyer also competed in the FINA World Aquatics Championships for the United States, appearing in the 1982 and 1986 editions.\nBoyer missed out on participating in the 1986 Goodwill Games due to a broken hand suffered on July 5, 1986 despite being already named to the roster.\nAfter missing out on being named to the national team for the 1984 Summer Olympics, Boyer was named to the team for the 1988 Summer Olympics as he neared the end of his international career. The United States lost to Yugoslavia in the finals of the Water polo at the 1988 Summer Olympics, but Boyer came away with an Olympic silver medal for his efforts.\nPost-playing career.\nBoyer attended law school at Western State University College of Law and was admitted to the State Bar of California on June 28, 1993.\nPrior to the 1996 Summer Olympics, Boyer was selected to carry the Olympic Torch in Orange County on April 28, 1996. He stayed close to the Olympic and water polo community, serving as a referee in the 2000 Summer Olympics and coached children at his local water polo club.\nHall of Fame recognition.\nBoyer is a member of the Class of 1998 USA Water Polo Hall of Fame and was inducted July 17, 1999.\nHe's also in the UCSB Gaucho Athletic Hall of Fame twice, being named once individually and once as a member of the 1979 NCAA Championship men's water polo team.\nBoyer shot.\nAmong his lasting records and achievements, Greg Boyer is credited with the creation of the \"Boyer shot\".

        "title": "American Football League (1926)",
        "text": "The first American Football League (AFL), sometimes called AFL I, AFLG, or the Grange League, was a professional American football league that operated in 1926. It was the first major competitor to the National Football League (NFL). Founded by Charles \"C.C.\" Pyle, (1882–1939), and General Charles X. Zimmerman, (1865–1926), as vice president and starring Hall of Fame halfback Harold Edward \"Red\" Grange, (1903–1991), the short-lived league with nine teams competed against the more established – then six-year-old – NFL, both for players and for fans. While Pyle's and Grange's New York Yankees team and the already established Philadelphia Quakers became reliable draws, the lack of star power and the uncertain financial conditions of the other seven teams led to the league's dissolution after one season.\nOrigin.\nThe controversial ending of the National Football League's 1925 season led to the founding of the first AFL by Red Grange's agent, C. C. Pyle. In an era in which no professional football team had a prearranged schedule (each team was responsible for booking its own games, with virtually no limitations as to the number of games), the Pottsville Maroons were hailed as the NFL champions by several newspapers after Pottsville defeated the Chicago Cardinals on December 6, even though there were still two weeks left in the season.\nIn order to attract another matchup against the Chicago Bears, Cardinals owner Chris O’Brien arranged for two more games: one against the Milwaukee Badgers the following Thursday, another against the Hammond Pros two days later, even though both teams had already disbanded for the season. Two shutouts (59–0 and 13–0) later, the Cardinals claimed the top spot with an 11–2–1 record. Simultaneous with the Cardinals–Pros game was an exhibition game between Pottsville and an all-star team consisting of former Notre Dame players at Shibe Park, near the home of the Frankford Yellow Jackets, who protested the invasion of territorial rights by the Maroons.\nDespite an order from NFL commissioner Joe Carr to cancel the exhibition, the Maroons proceeded to defeat the Notre Dame all-stars 9–7, scoring a field goal in the last minute. Carr immediately canceled the Maroons' scheduled game against the Providence Steam Roller and suspended the franchise. In the league meeting in January 1926, O’Brien refused to accept the championship, but the league record book remained unchanged, showing the Cardinals with an 11–2–1 record to the Maroons’ 10–2–0.\nWhile NFL management was contemplating the penalties for the suspended Pottsville franchise (which was eventually reinstated with the payment of a moderate fine) in December, C. C. “Cash and Carry” Pyle surprised the league by requesting a franchise in New York City for himself and star back Red Grange and secured a five-year lease for baseball's Yankee Stadium, in direct competition to Tim Mara's year-old New York Giants. When Carr announced a ruling in favor of Mara's objection to Pyle's application for NFL membership, Pyle announced the formation of the first American Football League, featuring Grange and the New York Yankees. The NFL charter member Rock Island Independents left the then seven-year-old league to join the new AFL, and the upstart league matched the NFL in having a road team representing Los Angeles.\nThe new league chose former Princeton athlete, former New York City deputy of street cleaning, and former Newark, New Jersey chief of waste disposal Bill Edwards as its league president and prepared to compete against the older league, (established 1920 and reorganized in 1922), for its talent and spectators. The AFL and NFL went to head-to-head competition in New York (Yankees and Giants), across the East River in Brooklyn (Horsemen and Lions), in Chicago (Bulls vs Bears and Cardinals), and in Philadelphia (Quakers and Yellow Jackets). The AFL's Cleveland Panthers, previously independent, were also preparing to go face-to-face with their hometown counterpart Cleveland Bulldogs, the earlier NFL champions of 1924, when Bulldogs owner Sam Deutsch decided to suspend the operations for 1926.\nTeams.\nBoston Bulldogs. Coached by Herb Treat, Boston's first professional football team had been in financial difficulty from the beginning, having played only six games before folding in November 1926. Its lack of stars and lack of offense (only three points per game) doomed the franchise as the team failed to score a point in either of its two home games in a nearly empty stadium. Boston would wait until 1932 before it received another professional football franchise— the NFL's Boston Braves, later briefly renamed the Redskins, and the Washington Redskins from 1937 to 2019.\nBrooklyn Horsemen. Coached by Eddie McNeeley, the Horsemen featured Notre Dame Four Horsemen Harry Stuhldreher and Elmer Layden. Unlike the other New York AFL team, Brooklyn suffered at the turnstiles. After only four games, the team was forced to merge with its NFL counterpart (the Lions), played three games in the NFL as the Brooklyn Lions (all shutouts), and winked out of existence at the end of the season.\nChicago Bulls. Owned and coached by Joey Sternaman (brother of Chicago Bears owner Dutch Sternaman), the Bulls featured the younger Sternaman as quarterback. While the Bulls' owner created havoc within the Chicago Cardinals by securing a lease for Comiskey Park (forcing the Cardinals into a much smaller Normal Field) and attempting to sign their star halfback Paddy Driscoll (who wound up on the Bears as a result of a trade), the Bulls quarterback provided the bulk of the team's offense, scoring 52 of the Bulls’ 88 points in 14 games. The Bulls were one of only four AFL teams still playing at the end of the season.\nCleveland Panthers. The Panthers had existed as an independent team since 1919, mostly playing teams from upstate New York. Coached by Roy Watts, the Panthers featured six players who played for the NFL's Cleveland Bulldogs in the 1925 season: Al Michaels, Al Nesser, Dick Wolf, Dave Noble, Ralph Vince and Doc Elliott. Despite having a potent offense and a winning record, the Panthers drew poorly at home aside from the league-opening game. The team left the AFL hours after losing to the Los Angeles Wildcats road team on October 31; they would return to independent status until folding in 1933.\nLos Angeles Wildcats (some news sources referred to the team as the \"L.A. Wilson Wildcats\"). Named after former University of Washington star halfback Wildcat Wilson and owned by C. C. Pyle and Red Grange, the Wildcats were strictly a traveling team based in Rock Island, Illinois. With only one exception, the entire roster consisted of players who competed for colleges located west of the Rockies. One of its 14 games was played in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (December 8: New York won, 28–0). Jim Clark was the head coach.\nNewark Bears. Owned by the New Jersey Athletic Association (William Coughlin, president) and coached by Hal Hansen, the Bears featured a backfield consisting of players who attended college in Georgia at Georgia Tech and Oglethorpe College. The Bears scored a touchdown in its first game, a 7–7 tie with Chicago, and then did not score again in its remaining four games. Newark was the first AFL to fold, calling it quits after playing Rock Island to a scoreless tie in front of 400 fans on October 24, 1926. For its final game, Newark changed its nickname to the Demons.\nNew York Yankees. Coached by Ralph Scott, the Yankees showcased Red Grange, quarterback George Pease, and wingback Eddie Tryon, a backfield who dominated the league in all offensive categories as the team finished in second place with a 10–5 record. While the rest of the league was starving at the turnstiles, the Yankees were a consistent draw. The Yankees were the only AFL team to outlast the league itself: the league dissolved as the Yankees were on a barnstorming tour of the South and West, and the Yankees entered the NFL as a continuation of the just-defunct Brooklyn franchise for the 1927 season. While New York Giants owner Tim Mara was officially the owner of the “new NFL franchise”, he leased it to C. C. Pyle and Red Grange to compete as the Yankees.\nPhiladelphia Quakers. The Quakers were a revival of an independent team which played one season in 1921 as an independent, and, before that, as the Union Club of Phoenixville from 1907 to 1920. Owned by Leo Conway and coached by Bob Folwell, the Quakers were the AFL's only league champion, finishing with an 8–2 record and possessing a formidable line anchored by tackles Bull Boehman and Century Milstead. On December 12, 1926, the Quakers played an exhibition game in a snowstorm against the New York Giants in front of 5000 windblown fans, and lost 31–0. Like Chicago and the traveling Wildcats, the Quakers were still alive at the end of the sole AFL season but folded along with the league at the end of the year.\nRock Island Independents. A charter member of the NFL, the Independents left the established league to make the unique accomplishment of being a charter member of a second professional football league, the AFL. Coached by Johnny Armstrong, the Independents played their first three games at Rock Island and then played the rest of their games as a traveling team before entering oblivion on November 21, 1926.\n1926 AFL standings.\n1 President of the New Jersey Athletic Association, the organization to whom the franchise was assigned\nLeague leaders.\nThe first AFL did not maintain individual statistics (the same was true of the NFL until 1934). In recent decades, researchers of the history of American football have compiled them from contemporaneous newspaper accounts. The following is reported by David S. Neft, Richard M. Cohen, and Rick Korch in \"The Football Encyclopedia: The Complete History of Professional Football, From 1892 to the Present\".\nScoring.\n\"8 tied with 12 points each\"\nTouchdown Passes.\n\"8 tied with one touchdown pass each\"\nTouchdown Receptions.\n\"19 tied with one touchdown catch each\"\nRushing Touchdowns.\n\"15 tied with one touchdown run each\"\nDemise of the first AFL.\nWhile the new nine-team AFL was competing against a National Football League that had expanded to twenty-two teams for the 1926 season, optimism yielded to economic reality for both leagues: Most professional football franchises were on financially shaky ground.\nThe war for talent and audience had a disastrous effect on all but the strongest teams: Of the 31 teams that were in existence across both leagues in 1926, only 12 survived to play in 1927, and 8 folded, while heavy financial losses left the NFL with no option but to eliminate 11 of their 22 teams.\nWhile the Yankees and the Quakers consistently drew large crowds, the rest of the AFL did not, and one by one AFL franchises went out of business, even with the financial assistance of C. C. Pyle.\nThe first sign of trouble occurred in mid-October, when Rock Island played its last home game (of three consecutive) and started wandering like the Wildcats. \nThe following week, Brooklyn played its third (and last) home game in the AFL, in front of mainly empty stands. On October 24, 1926, the Newark Bears changed its nickname to the Demons, played a scoreless tie with Rock Island, and disbanded hours after the end of the game. The following week saw the Cleveland franchise collapse.\nNovember 1926 was not much brighter for the house of cards that was the American Football League: the Brooklyn Horsemen played the last three games of its existence (all shutout losses) and left the league when it merged with its NFL counterparts, the Lions. By the middle of the month, the Boston Bulldogs folded, as did Rock Island a week later. By Thanksgiving of 1926, there were only four teams operating in the AFL (New York, Chicago, the Wildcats, and Philadelphia), with only the Quakers making a profit for the year, boosted in part by huge attendances stemming from the United States Sesquicentennial celebration, and the very large stadium capable of hosting them, while Pyle was spending his own money to keep the other three teams afloat.\nWhile the Yankees went on a barnstorming tour and the Quakers attempted to arrange for a challenge game between the champions of the two leagues, the Wildcats officially became inactive (in reality, they were touring with the Yankees as the \"designated opponent\").\nAfter the top six NFL teams had all declined the Quakers' challenge due to scheduling and other issues, the NFL's seventh-place finisher New York Giants accepted, with both parties opting for a game at the Polo Grounds on December 12, 1926. The Quakers' hopes for both football credibility and a financial windfall evaporated as the game was played in a blustery snowstorm, and only 5000 fans witnessed the Giants' complete domination of the AFL champions, with the Giants winning in a 31–0 blowout.\nThe same day, the Chicago Bulls and the New York Yankees met for the last American Football League game in Comiskey Park: the Yankees won, 7–3, and the league ceased to exist.\nAfter the AFL.\nWhile the bulk of the AFL disappeared at the demise of the league, three members had an official existence after the Giants–Quakers game. Although the Brooklyn Horsemen disbanded after its last NFL game, the team's franchise was never withdrawn or cancelled by the league. Tim Mara purchased the franchise and proceeded to lease it to C. C. Pyle for his New York Yankees team. The agreement between the two rivals limited the number of home games that the Yankees were permitted to play in its namesake stadium (four in 1927) and forced Pyle's squad to be primarily a road team displaying the talents of Red Grange. This arrangement lasted for two years: the Yankees were no more after the 1928 season. The Cleveland Panthers, on the other hand, reverted to independent status, and played until 1934."

        "text": "Aaron Andrew Robinson (June 23, 1915 – March 9, 1966) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher from to for the New York Yankees, Chicago White Sox, Detroit Tigers and Boston Red Sox. Robinson's tenure with the Yankees spanned the gap between the careers of Yankee Hall of Fame catchers Bill Dickey (1928–1946) and Yogi Berra (1946–1963).\nBorn in Lancaster, South Carolina, Robinson threw right-handed, batted left-handed and was listed as tall and . His professional playing career began in 1937 in minor league baseball.\nMajor League career.\nRobinson made his major league debut for the New York Yankees on May 6, 1943, playing in only one game before leaving to serve in the United States Coast Guard for the remainder of World War II. His service in the Coast Guard began on June 21, 1943, and he played baseball while serving. When the war ended in 1945, Robinson returned to the Yankees in July, appearing in 50 games. He took over as the Yankees' starting catcher in 1946 with promising results, posting a .297 batting average along with 16 home runs and 64 runs batted in. He also finished third among American League catchers with 25 baserunners caught stealing, and fourth in assists with 50. Robinson finished 16th in the American League Most Valuable Player Award voting.\nRobinson began the 1947 season as the Yankees' starting catcher, and was named as a reserve player for the American League in the 1947 All-Star Game. However, as the season progressed, Yogi Berra began to take over as the starting catcher. Robinson ended the year with a .270 batting average in 82 games, with 5 home runs and 36 runs batted in, as the Yankees went on to win the American League pennant. In the 1947 World Series, Robinson appeared in three games and started in Games 5 and 7, getting two hits in 10 at-bats, as the Yankees defeated the Brooklyn Dodgers in a seven-game series.\nHaving a surplus of catchers in 1948 with Berra, Sherm Lollar and Gus Niarhos, the Yankees decided to trade Robinson, along with Fred Bradley and Bill Wight, to the Chicago White Sox for Eddie Lopat in February of that year. He played in 98 games for the White Sox, but his offensive statistics continued to decline, as he hitfor a .252 batting average. After only one season with the White Sox, Robinson was traded to the Detroit Tigers for Billy Pierce in November 1948.\nRobinson became the Tigers' starting catcher in 1949 and 1950, providing solid defense; however, his batting continued to decline. During a pennant race late in the season, Robinson was involved in a critical play during a game against the Cleveland Indians on September 24. The Tigers had been in first place for most of the season and, had just fallen to second place behind the Yankees with one week left in the season. Heavy smoke from a Canadian forest fire forced the Indians to turn on the lights in Cleveland Stadium for the Sunday afternoon game. With the score tied 1–1, Bob Lemon opened the bottom of the tenth inning with a triple, and two intentional walks followed. With the bases loaded and one out, Luke Easter grounded out to Tigers' first baseman Don Kolloway, who then tagged first base. Because of the haze, Robinson did not see Kolloway remove the force after fielding the ball. Thinking he only had to step on home plate to force out Lemon, he failed to apply a tag, thus allowing Lemon to score the winning run. The Tigers fell two and a half games behind the Yankees in the standings with one week left in the season, and were unable to recover before the season ended.\nBy the time Robinson was acquired by the Boston Red Sox in 1951, he was hitting for just a .207 batting average. Robinson retired at the end of the season. In 610 games played in the big leagues, Robinson collected 478 hits, including 74 doubles, 11 triples and 61 home runs. He hit .260 lifetime.\nCareer statistics.\nOver an eight-year career, Robinson played in 610 games, accumulating 478 hits in 1,839 at bats for a .260 career batting average, along with 61 home runs and 272 runs batted in. Robinson was a fine defensive catcher, ending his career with a .990 fielding percentage. , according to Baseball-Reference, Robinson has the most career wins above replacement of any position player never to have stolen a base.\nIn only, the 'Aaron Robinson, MacGregor G176' catcher's mitt was produced. The trade between the Detroit Tigers and the Chicago White Sox involving Robinson and Pierce has been cited as one of the more lopsided trades in baseball history, as Robinson had retired from baseball by 1951, whereas Pierce had a lengthy, productive career with the White Sox.\nManaging career.\nAfter retiring as a player, Robinson became a manager in the minor leagues, managing the Fayetteville Highlanders to the Carolina League championship. He later managed the Winston-Salem Twins and won another title with the Shelby Colonels, winning the Western Carolina League championship despite having a losing record. Five years later, Robinson died at age 50, a victim of testicular cancer, on March 9, 1966, in Lancaster, South Carolina."

He threw and batted right-handed and was listed as tall and .\nMajor League career.\nBorn in St. Louis, Missouri, Schmidt signed with the New York Giants in 1951, and rose methodically through their minor league system. He missed the 1953 and 1954 seasons due to military service, but when he returned to baseball he was selected all-star catcher in successive years in the Double-A Texas League (1956) and the Triple-A American Association (1957). Concurrently the Giants' catchers of the 1950s, Wes Westrum, Ray Katt and Valmy Thomas, were aging or proving ineffective, and the franchise itself transferred to San Francisco.\nAs a rookie with the 1958 San Francisco Giants, Schmidt was selected to be on the National League team in the 1958 All-Star Game.

        "text": "Castle Park Cricket Ground is an English cricket ground in Colchester. The ground is in Lower Castle Park, part of the land surrounding Colchester Castle and within the area of the Historic England Grade II registered park and garden. It was used by Essex County Cricket Club for some of their first-class cricket matches between 1914 and 2016. When the ground is not used to stage First-class cricket matches, it is frequently used for Colchester &amp; East Essex Cricket Club.\nHistory.\nThe ground was opened in 1908 and the first match played here was on 18 June 1914 between Essex and Worcestershire in the County Championship. The ground is bordered by the remains of a Roman Wall.\nDue to the River Colne running alongside the ground, there used to be regular problems of drainage. In 1966, a match in progress was moved to Colchester's secondary venue, the Garrison A Cricket Ground. Matches returned to the ground in 1974 when a John Player League match was played and Essex played on the ground annually until 2016. Since 2017 matches at the ground have been \"suspended\" as a result of changes to the ways in which fixtures are arranged by the England and Wales Cricket Board.\nIrish pop vocal band Westlife were to perform at the ground on 11 July 2020 for their \"Stadiums in the Summer Tour\".\nNotable Matches.\nDuring a county championship match between Essex and Kent at the ground in 1938, Arthur Fagg became the first batsman, to hit a double century in each innings, scoring 244 in his first and 202 not out in his second.\nKen McEwan, always a prolific scorer, hit five hundreds in four consecutive visits to Castle Park between 1981 and 1984. He surpassed himself in 1983, scoring 181 against Gloucestershire and then, in the same week, 189 against Worcestershire, on both occasions securing a comfortable victory for Essex.\nIn 1981, after Glamorgan had secured a first innings lead, a century each from Graham Gooch and Brian Hardie allowed Essex to declare their second innings at 411 for 9. Undeterred at being set 325 runs in as many minutes, Javed Miandad scored 200 and it was only when he ran out of partners, some 14 runs short of the required total, that Essex and a nervous crowd of supporters could breathe freely again."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career triples leaders",
        "text": "In baseball, a triple is a hit in which the batter advances to third base in one play, with neither the benefit of a fielding error nor another runner being put out on a fielder's choice. Triples were more common in baseball's dead-ball era, when teams relied more on stolen bases and hit and run plays than on the home run. More distant fences in old ballparks, such as Pittsburgh's Forbes Field and Detroit's Tiger Stadium, also produced fewer home runs and more triples on well-hit balls. As a result, most of the players on this list have been retired for decades. Only two players in the top 50 all-time career triples leaders played after WWII (Stan Musial and Roberto Clemente), and there are no players in the top 50 who played after 1972.\nIn 2006, the \"Hardball Times\" lamented the decline of the 100-triple player, although three have joined the list since that time. Fangraphs, a statistical website, likewise noted the lack of modern 100-triple hitters in 2013. Of the 162 Major League Baseball players who have hit 100 or more triples, 69 are members of Baseball's Hall of Fame.\nHall of Famer Sam Crawford of the Detroit Tigers holds the Major League Baseball triples record, with 309. Second to him is his Tigers teammate, Ty Cobb, with 297, the American League record. Honus Wagner is third with 252, the National League record. Jake Beckley (243), Roger Connor (233), Tris Speaker (222), Fred Clarke (220), and Dan Brouthers (205) are the only other players to have hit at least 200 triples. Only triples hit during the regular season are included in the totals (George Brett, Rafael Furcal, and Derek Jeter are tied for the record in post-season triples, with five).\nJim O'Rourke was the first player to reach the 100-triple mark, doing so with the New York Giants in 1886. With Kenny Lofton's retirement after the 2007 season, 2008 was the first season since 1885 in which no active player had more than 100 triples. Carl Crawford hit his 100th triple in 2010, becoming the only active player on the list at that time. José Reyes became the latest player to reach the 100 triple plateau, doing so on April 8, 2012.\nWhen Reyes retired after the 2018 season, Major League Baseball once again had no active player with 100 career triples. The active career triples leader is Charlie Blackmon, who has 63 career triples as of 2023. He is tied for 486th on the all-time list."

        "title": "Colorado Buffaloes men's basketball",
        "text": "The Colorado Buffaloes men's basketball team represents the University of Colorado Boulder. The team competes in the Pac-12 Conference of NCAA Division I. They are currently coached by Tad Boyle.\nThe Buffaloes have competed in sixteen NCAA Tournaments, making it to the Final Four in 1942 and 1955. Colorado has played in eleven National Invitation Tournaments, winning the tournament in 1940 and making the semifinals in 1991 and 2011. The Buffs won the Pac-12 conference tournament in 2012, their first season as a member. Colorado is scheduled to rejoin the Big 12 Conference beginning in 2024.\nTeam history.\nThe Silver &amp; Gold become Buffaloes.\nThe Colorado Men's Basketball team was initially known as the Silver and Gold, and began play on January 10, 1901, and beat State Prep School 34–10. While unaffiliated their first few seasons, the school joined the Rocky Mountain Conference in 1909. From 1902 to 1935, the school racked up a 200–151 record.\nIn 1934, the Silver and Gold became known as the Buffaloes. CU students rented a buffalo calf to cheer the team on for the final football game that year, and the nickname stuck with the school since then.\nThe Frosty Cox era.\nThe first coaching star for CU was Forrest B. \"Frosty\" Cox. Cox spent 13 years on the sidelines from 1936 to 1950. In his second season with the school, the Buffaloes joined the Mountain States Conference, where they would proceed to win four MSC titles. Under Cox, the Buffs had quite a bit of success—both individually and as a team. Cox had four All-Americans during his time with the Buffs – Jack Harvey (1939 &amp; 1940), Jim Willcoxon (1939), Bob Doll (1942), and Leason McCloud (1942). Cox lead the team to three NCAA tournament bids and two NIT bids while in Boulder.\nArguably the greatest team in CU Basketball history was the 1940 squad which not only got invited to the NCAA tournament but to the NIT tournament as well. The Buffs won the more prestigious at the time NIT Tournament, which leads some to claim that the 1940 team were National Champs. In 1942, the Buffs lost in the NCAA Tournament championship game to the Stanford Cardinals, which is the school's all-time best finish in that tournament.\nIn 1947, the Buffs left the Mountain States Conference and joined the Big Seven Conference. When Cox concluded his CU career, he had the best win–loss percentage (62.3%) of any CU coach who coached for more than one season.\n\"The Big Burd\" rules the court.\nAfter Cox left CU, Horace \"Bebe\" Lee took over as the Buffs head coach. He led the school to two NCAA Tournament bids, including a Third Place finish in the 1955 NCAA tournament. However, the star of this era was Burdette \"Burdie\" Haldorson. Also known as \"The Big Burd,\" Haldorson was arguably the best player in Colorado Men's Basketball history. An All-American whose number is retired at CU, Haldorson was named to All-Big 7 Conference team two times and is also a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, The Colorado Sports Hall of Fame, the University of Colorado Athletic Hall of Fame, and the Pac-12 Basketball Hall of Honor. He also won two gold medals with USA Basketball (1956 &amp; 1960).\nIn 1955, Haldorson led the Big 7 Conference in scoring with 23.9 points per game as he led the Buffs to the third-place finish in the 1955 NCAA Tournament.\n\"Sox\" Walseth leads The way.\nIn 1956, CU named former player Russell \"Sox\" Walseth as their head coach. Walseth graduated from CU in 1948 as a three-time letterman in both basketball and baseball for the Buffaloes, and came back to coach after stints at High School (Bakersfield, California) and South Dakota State. \"Sox\" led the team to three Big 8 titles (the school joined the conference in 1958) and three NCAA tournament bids. In both the 1961–62 &amp; 1962–63 seasons, the Buffs reached the second round of the NCAA tournament before being eliminated by Cincinnati.\n\"Sox\" had two All-Americans while at CU—Ken Charlton (1963) and Cliff Meely (1971). Another key performer on the successful 1961–62 team, which beat Kansas to take the Big Eight Conference title before proceeding to the NCAA tournament, was Wilky Gilmore. Charlton and Gilmore were both named to the All Big-Eight team that year.\nSomewhat later in Walseth's tenure as coach, another standout at Boulder was Scott Wedman – a sharp-shooting forward from Denver's Mullen High School. Wedman made a huge mark on the CU record books as he led the team in scoring and rebounding for two seasons, free throw percentage for one season and field goal percentage all three years he played at CU. Those numbers placed him seventh in career scoring, sixth in rebounding and eighth in field goal percentage in CU history at the time he left the school. He also was the highest draft pick in school history, going 2nd overall in the ABA Draft to the Memphis Sounds (he was also drafted 6th overall in the NBA draft by the KC-Omaha Kings). Wedman went on to play 12 years in the NBA.\nWhen he retired after twenty seasons, \"Sox\" was the all-time winningest coach in CU history with a 261–245 record. Four years later, he came back to coach the women's team to a 77–21 record, including an incredible 43–0 home record, before retiring again. In 1996, the CU Event Center basketball court was named after him, so the Buffs all play on \"Sox Walseth Court\" now.\nCliff Meely.\nThe star of the program under \"Sox\" Walseth was undoubtedly Cliff Meely. Walseth often called Meely \"the most complete player\" he had ever coached, and Meely set sixteen school records while playing for the Buffaloes and eight Big 8 Conference records.\nMeely is the school's all-time leader in points and rebounds per game, and was named an All-American during the 1971 season. The list of accolades he received while in Boulder is numerous, but along with being an All-American, in 1969 he was named both Big 8 Player of the Year and Big 8 Sophomore of the Year. In fact, all three years he was at Colorado he was named to the All-Big 8 First Team. Because of his dominant play, he was not only named to the 1970s Big 8 All-Decade First Team, but in 1996 he was named to the AP's All-time Big 8 Conference Basketball first team along with Wayman Tisdale (Oklahoma), Danny Manning (Kansas), Jo Jo White (Kansas) and Rolando Blackman (Kansas State).\nColorado has retired the #20 that he wore while in Boulder.\nIndividual talents lead the way.\nThe lackluster results of Walseth's latter tenure would become the norm for Colorado over the next two decades. From 1977–78 to 1995–96, the Buffs would only have four winning seasons, and only once would even get to .500 in Big Eight play.\nWhile the Buffs struggled record-wise in the '80s and early '90s, they did have a few individual standouts that brought the team national attention. From 1980 to 1984, the Buffs were led by Jay Humphries, an exciting guard who made his mark all over CU's record book in just those three seasons. On offense, he became the school's all-time assist leader and also finished fourth all-time in scoring. Even with that though, Humphries was best known for his defense. Humphries is the school's all-time leader in thefts and led the nation in steals in 1982–83 with 115. Humphries was twice named Honorable Mention All-American (1982–83 &amp; 1983–84) before being drafted by the Phoenix Suns with the thirteenth pick of the NBA draft. A teammate of Humphries in high school and at Colorado was post player Vince Kelley. Kelley also played with the Buffaloes from 1980 to 1984 and finished third all-time in career rebounds at CU. Kelly graduated in 1984 and played professionally in Australia and Portugal.\nAfter starting out the '80s with talent like Humphries and Kelley, the Buffs found a way to round the decade out with two more stars to lead the team. Shaun Vandiver was a transfer from Hutchinson CC who only played three years in Boulder, but when it was all said &amp; done finished as the school's all-time leader in field goal percentage and was the school's second leading scorer &amp; rebounder in history. For his work, he was named Honorable Mention All-American in 1989–90 and was named Big Eight tournament MVP from a losing team after leading the 8th seeded Buffs to the Tournament Championship game before falling short – the first eight seed to ever make the championship game.\nVandiver wasn't alone on the team though as he had guard Stevie Wise there to help lead the way. Wise played 119 games for the Buffs, the fifth most in school history. He was known for being one of CU's all-time great 3 point specialists and he holds numerous CU shooting marks. He finished his time as the number three scorer in school history and is still in the top 10 for assists in school history. Wise &amp; Vandiver led the team on their run to the 1991 NIT Final Four. It was the school's first postseason appearance since 1969, and when it was said &amp; done, they got to cut down the nets in front of a standing room only crowd at the Events Center before heading to the NIT Final Four in NYC where they ended up third.\nThe next player to make his mark on the record books was Donnie Boyce. The Illinois product spent four years at CU and when he left he was the school's all-time leading scorer with 1,995 points. He was the first Buff to lead the team in scoring all four years at CU, and only the second Buff to ever do it. While Boyce was lighting it up, the team struggled. It appeared that Boyce was finally going to get to play in a postseason tournament in 1995, but he broke his leg in the opening round of the Big Eight tournament against Oklahoma. The team went on to earn an NIT bid–their first postseason bid of any sort since 1969–but he was unable to play.\nThe Chauncey Billups years.\nThe most beloved player in school history, Chauncey Billups is usually the first person that people think of when they think Colorado basketball. The three-time winner of Colorado's Mr. Basketball award and a member of the McDonald's All-American team his senior year, the Denver native could have gone anywhere in the nation to play college ball. Even though it was obvious he wouldn't be staying for the entire four years due to a pro career calling his name, he had no shortage of suitors. With all of that, he decided to stay close to home and enroll at CU.\nIn his first year at Colorado, he set a school record for points scored by a freshman and was named to the Big 8 All-Freshman team as well as the All-Big 8 Conference Second Team and the Kansas City Star Big 8 team—an honor that was voted on by the players themselves. Unfortunately, Chauncey's first year in Boulder was filled only with individual accolades as the team underperformed and head coach Joe Harrington was relieved of duties. His sophomore year however, Chauncey was able to get the team going. Behind new head coach Ricardo Patton, and in a new conference (the Big 12 Conference), Chauncey at one point had led the Buffs to a 14–3 record and the #18 ranking in the nation. This team would make the Buffs' first NCAA Tournament appearance in 28 years, and notched their first winning conference record in 24 years. They would upset Indiana in the first round before losing to North Carolina in the second round. For his work, Chauncey was named not only to the All-Big 12 Conference First Team, but was named an All-American as well. Chauncey declared for the NBA draft, where he was picked third overall by the Boston Celtics, and he went on to play 17 years in the NBA.\nThe Buffs enter The Big 12.\nOnce Chauncey left, the Buffs were faced with a rough conference slate, but still managed to have some success behind head coach Ricardo Patton. Players such as Jaquay Walls (Big 12 All-Newcomer Team) and Jamahl Mosley helped lead the team to back-to-back NIT bids, but things started to improve once David Harrison showed up on campus for the 2001–02 season. Harrison was named to the Big 12 All-Freshman team and lead the school in scoring, while also setting a school record with a field goal percentage of 63.8% – good enough for third nationally. Harrison had help though in the form of Stéphane Pelle. Pelle was the first player in 11 years to average a double-double, putting up 12.8 points and 10.8 rebounds per game in the 2001–02 season. The next season, with Harrison &amp; Pelle down low and Michel Morandais coming in to form on the wing, the Buffs won 20 games and capped it off with an NCAA Tournament bid. They made the NIT the next season after Harrison left early to go into the NBA draft.\nNew all-time scoring leaders.\nRichard Roby stepped on the CU campus in 2004 and became the first freshman since Chauncey Billups to lead the team in scoring and he ended up joining Donnie Boyce as the only Buffs to lead the team in scoring all four years on campus. In his sophomore season, Roby &amp; the Buffs won twenty games and ended up in the NIT Tournament, while also being named to the All-Big 12 First Team. Unfortunately, he was faced with a freshmen laden team the next season, as there were eight first year players (a school record) on the 2006–07 squad. The next season showed improvement and the Buffs became the first team in Big 12 history to be a 12 seed and upset a number 5 seed (Baylor) in the Big 12 Tournament. When he finally graduated from CU, he left the school as the all-time leading scorer with 2,001 points—a record that still stands to this day.\nBut it is a record that is shared, because during his senior year, he shared time on the floor with a freshman named Cory Higgins who would one day tie him as the school's all-time leading scorer. Higgins was more than just a scorer though as during his sophomore year he was one of only 13 players nationally to lead or finish second on his team in five major statistical categories—points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocked shots. Higgins also found a way to rank nationally in steals, free throw percentage and scoring as well. For his junior year, Higgins got some more help with the arrival of freshman guard Alec Burks. Higgins &amp; Burks became the first tandem to net over 500 points in the same season since the 1990–91 campaign and were rewarded as Higgins was named to the All-Big 12 Third Team and Burks was named All-Big 12 Freshman of the Year.\nThe Tad Boyle era.\nTad Boyle was named the 18th coach in University of Colorado men's basketball history on April 19, 2010. In his first season in Boulder, Boyle led the Buffs to a school-record 18 home wins and their highest Big 12 finish (t-5th) since 2005–06. CU ranked first in the Big 12 and fifth nationally in free throw percentage (77.8) for the 2010–11 season. Boyle's efficient attack also ranked 12th nationally in scoring (79.6 ppg) and 19th nationally in field goal percentage (47.3).\nBoyle earned National Coach of the Week honors (Hoops Report, Jan. 10–16) after leading the Buffs to a 3–0 conference start, including wins over No. 9/8 Missouri and No. 21/20 Kansas State. The win over the Wildcats gave CU its first road win over a nationally ranked opponent since defeating No. 20 Texas Tech in January 1997. For the season, CU defeated four ranked teams, including a comeback of 22 points down (ranking second all-time in school history) to upset No. 5/5 Texas, 91–89. Despite having a very solid season and getting to the semi-finals of the conference tournament, Boyle and the Buffs were snubbed of a bid in the NCAA tournament. CU ended up making it all the way to the NIT semi-finals but lost to Alabama.\nIn his second season at the helm Tad faced an uphill battle, losing 4 starters, 78% of the scoring and most notably Alec Burks to the NBA (#12 overall pick to the Utah Jazz). He was able turn all of this into his second 24 win season in a row, a Pac-12 tournament championship and a trip to the NCAA Tournament as a #11 seed where CU advanced to the round of 32 for the first time in 15 years after beating #6 seed UNLV 68–64 in Albuquerque. CU's magical run was ended by Baylor in the round of 32, but in just two seasons, Boyle became the most successful post-season coach in the history of Colorado Basketball.\nThe AllBuffs.com All-Time Men's Basketball Team.\nThe users on AllBuffs.com had a vote in the summer of 2012 to decide who they considered to be the members of the \"All-Time Men's Basketball Team\" at the University of Colorado. The players named were:\nCoaching.\nRecord by coach.\n¹ Invitations\nPlayers.\nIndividual awards.\nConference honors.\n1970's Big 8 Conference All-Decade Team\nBig 8 Conference Player of the Year\nBig XII Conference First Team\nBig XII Conference Freshman of the Year\nPac-12 Conference Defensive Player of the Year\nPac-12 Conference First Team\nPac-12 Conference Second Team\nPac-12 Conference Most Improved Player\nConference tournament history.\nBig Eight Conference tournament.\nThe Buffs went 4–20 in the Big Eight Conference tournament in their time in the conference. Their best performance came in the 1990 season when they became the first #8 seed to make the conference championship game before falling to Oklahoma in the championship match. For their effort, Shaun Vandiver was named Tournament MVP despite being on the losing team.\nBig 12 Conference tournament.\nIn their fifteen seasons in the Big 12, the Buffs managed to go 9–15 in Conference tournament play. Despite not winning a conference championship, they do have two successful claims to fame during their time. The first one was in 2008 when the Buffs became the first #12 seed to upset a #5 seed as they beat Baylor in the opening round. The other one was during their last year in the conference when they beat Iowa State in the opening round and followed that up with their third win of the season over Kansas State before falling just short to Kansas in the semifinals.\nPac-12 Conference tournament.\n2012 Pac-12 Tournament champions.\nThe Buffs won their first conference tournament championship in 2012, their first year in the Pac-12 conference. Led by tournament MVP Carlon Brown, the 6th–seeded Buffs won four games in four days to bring the championship back to Boulder and earn an invitation to the 2012 NCAA tournament where they would go on to beat UNLV in the second round before losing to Baylor in the third round.\nPostseason results.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Buffaloes have appeared in the NCAA Tournament 15 times, with a combined record of 12–17.\nNIT.\nThe Buffaloes have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 13 times. Their combined record is 14–12. They were NIT Champions in 1940.\nCBI.\nThe Buffaloes have appeared in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) one time. Their record is 1–1.\nRecord vs. Pac-12 opponents.\nThe Colorado Buffaloes have the following all-time series records vs. Pac-12 opponents. They lead the series vs. seven opponents.\nFacilities and fans.\nCU Events Center.\nThe CU Events Center is an 11,064-seat multi-purpose arena on the Boulder main campus of the University of Colorado. The arena opened in 1979, and is home to the Colorado Buffaloes men's and women's basketball teams and the CU volleyball team. The CEC opened in 1979 and the first game played there was the CU Men's Basketball team hosting the USSR basketball team. The largest crowd ever to witness a game was on December 5, 2012, when 11,708 people watched CU play CSU (CU won the game 70–61). The facility has also hosted its fair share of concerts as Bob Dylan, U2 and Stevie Wonder are some of the artists to have performed there.\nThe facility was originally named the CU Events/Conference Center and cost $7.7 million to build. In September 1990, it was renamed the Coors Event Center to honor a $5 million gift from the Adolph Coors Foundation. In 2018, the name was changed to the CU Events Center.\nPractice facility.\nIn the fall of 2011, the school opened the doors on a brand new practice facility that is located right next to the CU Event Center. This provides locker rooms and practice courts for the men's &amp; women's basketball teams as well as the women's volleyball team. The facility is 43,000 square feet and cost $10.8 million, all from private funds. Each of the two practice courts are 11,000 square feet and are exact replicas of the CU Event Center—down to the lines and logos. The school also took extra care to make sure that the facility matches the other 200-plus buildings on campus by using sandstone and red-tiled roofs.\nThe facility is also one of two athletic facilities to be given LEED Platinum Certification, which is the highest possible by the internationally recognized system developed by the US Green Building Council. The facility is estimated to be 40% more energy efficient and 30% more water efficient than similar buildings to it.\nC-Unit.\nThe student section for CU Basketball is referred to as the C-Unit. A grassroots organization that was started by a few students in 2004, the C-Unit has gone on to receive tons of praise for their ability to cheer the Buffs on. They started getting attention nationally when the school sent 50 members to Los Angeles for the 2012 Pac-12 Tournament, and then upon getting a bid to the NCAA Tournament, the school sent 100 of them to The Pit in Albuquerque to cheer the team on in their victory over UNLV in the second round of the tournament. The C-Unit, combined with the large number of CU fans who followed the team down for the weekend, turned The Pit into \"Coors Event Center South\"."

        "text": "Nelson cricket team is a cricket team representing the Nelson Region of New Zealand. It played first-class cricket from 1874 to 1891, and currently competes in the Hawke Cup.\nPlaying history.\nCricket was first reported as being played in Nelson in the \"Nelson Examiner\" in March 1844, in a match between the Surveyors of the Land Company and Nelson. Nelson as a representative team played interprovincial cricket as early as 1862, later first playing first-class cricket in 1873-74 against Wellington at the Basin Reserve, becoming the fifth team to play first-class cricket in New Zealand. This match is also notable for having ended in a tie, the eighth time this had happened and one of sixty occasions overall that a first-class match has ended in such a result. \nOver the coming seasons, Nelson averaged one first-class match a year, all but one of them against Wellington, before appearing in first-class cricket for a final time in 1891 against Wellington at Trafalgar Park. Nelson played 17 times in first-class cricket, winning nine and losing seven. Nelson used three home grounds during this period, all of them in the city of Nelson: Victory Square, the Botanical Gardens and Trafalgar Park.\nThe 17 matches were extremely low-scoring affairs. Only twice did a side reach 200, and on 40 occasions a side was dismissed for under 100. Nelson's highest team score was 238 at Wellington in 1880-81, when Louis Balmain, in his only first-class match, top-scored with 40, having also top-scored with 50, Nelson's first individual fifty, in the first innings. Nelson's only other fifty was a 52 made by Andrew Bennett at Wellington in 1886-87. The best innings and match figures were 9 for 43 and 5 for 20 (14 for 63 in the match) by Thomas Eden in 1875-76. Bennett, in his only other first-class match, took 6 for 13 and 6 for 5 for Nelson in 1885-86.\nThe origin of the \"Nelson\" superstition in cricket is unknown. However, in both Nelson's first and last innings in first-class cricket they were dismissed for 111 – \"Nelson\".\nCurrent status.\nNelson today compete in the Hawke Cup, which is played below first-class level. Nelson have won the competition several times, and hold the record for the longest period of holding the trophy, from December 1958 to February 1965. They also held the title from 1979 to 1983. \nIn 1963-64, defending their title against Waikato, Nelson made 632, a Hawke Cup record. The record stood until Nelson beat it in 1983-84, when they scored 641 for seven defending their title against Taranaki. In their next match, in 1984-85, they beat it again, scoring 649 against Wairarapa. The record stood until Manawatu beat it with 650 all out in 1993-94.\nThe Nelson Cricket Association relocated from Trafalgar Park to Saxton Oval in 2009. The Nelson Cricket Association forms part of the Central Districts cricket team, which competes in first-class, List A and Twenty20 domestic cricket competitions."

        "title": "Sailing yacht",
        "text": "A sailing yacht (US ship prefixes SY or S/Y), is a leisure craft that uses sails as its primary means of propulsion. A yacht may be a sail or power vessel used for pleasure, cruising, or racing. There is no standard definition, so the term applies here to sailing vessels that have a cabin with amenities that accommodate overnight use. To be termed a \"yacht\", as opposed to a \"boat\", such a vessel is likely to be at least in length and have been judged to have good aesthetic qualities. Sailboats that do not accommodate overnight use or are smaller than are not universally called yachts. Sailing yachts in excess of are generally considered to be superyachts.\nSailing yachts are actively used in sport and are among categories recognized by the governing body of sailing sports, World Sailing.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"yacht\" originates from the Dutch word \"jacht\" (pl. \"jachten\", which means \"hunt\"), and originally referred to light, fast sailing vessels that the Dutch Republic navy used to pursue pirates and other transgressors around and into the shallow waters of the Low Countries.\nHistory.\nThe history of pleasure boats begins with rowed craft in Pharaonic Egyptian times. The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of King James I of England. Pleasure vessels acquired the name \"yacht\" after the time of Charles II, who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of \"jachten\" were already well developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental catamaran. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.\nStarting in 1739, England found itself in a series of wars—a period that saw a decline in yachting. In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720, followed by the Lough Ree Yacht Club in 1770. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at Cumberland. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government revenue cutters, turned their skills again to yachts.\nEvolution of design.\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically luggers, schooners, or sloops with fore-and-aft rigs. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The America's Cup arose out of a contest between the yacht, \"America\", and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow beam (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht \"America\" crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. \"America's\" pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs were not faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.\nBy the turn of the 20th century, racing yachts featured long overhangs, fore and aft, and a narrow, deep keel by historic standards. Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.\nCruising yachts.\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th century was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe (John MacGregor) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a cutter (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most notable of these was Joshua Slocum's \"Spray\", a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).\nRacing yachts.\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs. In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as John Alden and Starling Burgess employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the Cruising Club of America and the Royal Ocean Racing Club in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were Olin Stephens, Philip Rhodes, Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous 1979 Fastnet Race in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.\nCruising.\nCruising yachts may be designed for near-shore use or for passage-making. They may also be raced, but they are designed and built with the comfort and amenities necessary for overnight voyages. Qualities considered in cruising yachts include: performance, comfort under way, ease of handling, stability, living comfort, durability, ease of maintenance, and affordability of ownership.\nCategories.\nCruising sailboats share the common attribute of providing overnight accommodations. They may be classified as \"small\" (easy to haul behind a trailer), \"near-shore\" and \"off-shore\". Multihull sailing yachts are a category, apart.\nDesign.\nDesign considerations for a cruising yacht include seaworthiness, performance, sea kindliness, and cost of construction, as follows:\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with monohulls. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability—having separate hulls far apart—for their resistance to capsize. Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater windage, more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. \nConstruction.\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s fiberglass became a prevalent material. These materials and other composites continue in use.\nRigs.\nGaff rigs have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are Bermuda, fractional, cutter, and ketch. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the yawl, schooner, wishbone, catboat. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its supporting standing rigging, but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.\nGear.\nSailboats employ standing rigging to support the rig, running rigging to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.\nAccommodations.\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the galley. A cruising yacht is likely to have a head (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger yachts may have additional staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.\nEngine.\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such power is inboard on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an outboard gasoline motor. Target shaft horsepower for the engine per unit of displacement is related to hull speed per square root of waterline length all to the third power. Choice of engines is also a function of target propeller speed at cruise. A sailboat might have a engine, whereas a sailboat might have a engine.\nSystems.\nElectrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a desalination water maker, driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.\nStyling.\nHull design can affect the aesthetics of a sailing yacht. The shape of the bow and stern are significant factors, as is a yacht's \"sheer line\" (the curvature of its deck). Bow shapes include the \"bow\" (convex curve), \"destroyer\" or \"vertical\" (near vertical), and \"knuckle\" or \"raked\" (angled straight to the water line). Stern shapes include \"raked aft\" or \"counter\" (slight outward angle), \"straight\" (up and down), \"reverse angle\" (sloping downward from the deck). As to sheer, traditional yachts have the deck follow a curve below an imaginary straight line from stem (top of bow) to stern.\nRacing.\nRacing yachts emphasize performance over comfort. High-performance rigs provide aerodynamic efficiency and hydrodynamically efficient hulls minimize drag through the water and sideways drift.\nDesign features.\nRacing yachts have a wide selection of weights and shapes of sail to accommodate different wind strengths and points of sail. A suite of sails on a racing yachts would include several weights of jib and spinnaker, plus a specialized storm jib and trysail (in place of the mainsail). Performance yachts are likely to have full-battened kevlar or carbon-fiber mainsails.\nUnderwater foils can become more specialized, starting with a higher-aspect ratio fin keel with hydrodynamically efficient bulbs for ballast. On some racing yachts, a canting keel shifts angle from side to side to promote sailing with less heeling angle (sideways tilt), while other underwater foils mitigate leeway (sideways motion).\nClasses.\nWorld Sailing recognizes eleven classes of racing yacht:"

Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote (24 votes) would not appear on future BBWAA ballots, and under then-current rules were also eliminated from future consideration by the Veterans Committee. A 2001 change in Hall policy restored the eligibility of players dropped from BBWAA balloting for Veterans Committee consideration.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). The one candidate who received at least 75% of the vote and were elected is indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\". The seven candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with an asterisk (*).\nRon Santo was on the ballot for the 15th and final time.\nThe newly-eligible players included 17 All-Stars, nine of whom were not included on the ballot, representing a total of 44 All-Star selections. Among the new candidates were 11-time All-Star Gary Carter, 6-time All-Star Willie Randolph and 5-time All-Stars Pedro Guerrero. The field also included one Cy Young Award-winner, Mike Flanagan.\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Jim Acker, Dave Anderson, Floyd Bannister, Jesse Barfield, Juan Berenguer, Dave Bergman, Don Carman, Rick Cerone, Mike Fitzgerald, Jim Gantner, Rich Gedman, Jerry Don Gleaton, Von Hayes, Brook Jacoby, Dennis Lamp, John Moses, Rance Mulliniks, Ken Oberkfell, Gary Pettis, Jamie Quirk, Rafael Ramirez, Don Robinson, Luis Salazar, Dave Schmidt, Mike Scioscia, Matt Sinatro, Dave Smith, Pat Tabler, Walt Terrell, and Denny Walling.\nThe Veterans Committee.\nThe Veterans Committee met in closed sessions to elect as many as two executives, managers, umpires, and older major league players—the categories considered in all its meetings since 1953.\nBy an arrangement since 1995 it separately considered candidates from the Negro leagues and from the 19th century with authority to select one from each of those two special ballots.\nThe committee elected four people, the maximum number permitted:\ncenter fielder Larry Doby from the 1950s, executive Lee MacPhail from the 1960s, pitcher Bullet Rogan from the Negro leagues, and shortstop George Davis from the 19th century.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nSam Lacy\nreceived the J. G. Taylor Spink Award honoring a baseball writer.\nFord C. Frick Award.\nJaime Jarrín\nreceived the Ford C. Frick Award honoring a baseball broadcaster."

It is the oldest rugby club in the United States, and fields Division I Men's and Women's teams, U-19 Boy's and U-19 Girls teams, two old boy teams, one of which belongs to the non-competitive \"Golden Oldies\". The NYRC was founded to continue a rugby tradition that dates back to the formation of the NYRFC in 1929.\nThe original club was formed in 1929 as the New York Nomads. They subsequently began competing as the New York Rugby Football Club (New York RFC). The New York RFC played a principal role in the development of the Eastern Rugby Union. It was the only team in the United States to be accepted for membership in the Rugby Union for the 1932-33 international directory and in 1933, hosted the Cambridge University Vandals, the first European club to tour the United States.\nThe New York RFC continued to compete successfully until the beginning of World War II. It disbanded during the War and resumed activities afterward.\nIn 1957, the New York RFC created the New York Rugby Football Club, Inc. (\"NYRFC\") under the Membership Corporations Law of New York State.\nIn 1959, the NYRFC organized its first seven-a-side rugby tournament. Since then \"New York Sevens\" has been conducted annually on the first Saturday following the Thanksgiving Holiday and grown into the largest international sevens tournament in the United States.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s the NYRFC was a dominant force in the Eastern United States. In 1977, The NYRFC made a Winter-tour contest of matches in the Caribbean and Florida. NYRFC played the Freeport, Bahamas team and the team from Nassau, Bahamas. The Winter tour ended with the NYRFC playing very good Miami RFC team. In 1982, the NYRFC merged with Eastside RFC (formerly Hunter College RFC). The NYRFC was the first United States team to be invited to compete in Scandinavia, touring Denmark in 1986. The team competed in Mexico in 1986, Japan, Thailand, Italy and Philippines in 1989, Bahamas in 1991, Argentina and Brazil in 1992, England, Ireland and Wales in 1994 and Spain in 1997.\nIn 1997, the NYRFC voted to field a women's team and offered playing membership to former players of the Gotham Women's Rugby Club.\nThe New York Rugby Club competes as part of the Empire Geographic Union, and USA Rugby. The NYRC Women won the USA Rugby Women's Div I National Championship in 2006. In 2009 the NYRC Women’s Team won the inaugural season of the WPL."

He played for the Florida Marlins, Cincinnati Reds, and Cleveland Indians. He also spent six highly successful seasons in Nippon Professional Baseball with the Nippon Ham Fighters and Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes. He now owns a sports training facility in Ajax, Ontario.\nCareer.\nWilson signed with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1988 as an amateur free agent and was promoted as high as Double-A in the Toronto organization.\nWilson was then drafted by the Florida Marlins in the 1992 MLB Expansion Draft as their first pick (second overall, behind David Nied by the Colorado Rockies).\nWilson played a total of 22 major league games with the Marlins (1993), Cincinnati Reds (1995), and Cleveland Indians (1996), failing to get a hit as either a Marlin or a Red, going 0-for-23 in his time with these teams, with 15 strikeouts and no walks or HBPs.\nAfter an 0-for-2 start with the Indians (with 1 strikeout), Wilson recorded his first major league hit in his 26th at bat. His major league career ended shortly thereafter; Wilson retired with 3 MLB hits in total.\nIn 1997, he joined the Nippon Ham Fighters of the Japanese Pacific League after being released from the Indians.\nOn June 21, 1997, he hit home runs in 4 consecutive at bats, becoming only the second player in Japanese baseball history to ever attain this mark after Sadaharu Oh, ending that season with a league-leading 37 home runs.\nIn 1998, he greatly improved his clutch hitting, leading the league with 33 home runs and 128 RBIs to win the Best Nine Award for designated hitter.\nIn 1999, he played only 6 games due to a knee injury, but the team decided not to release him at the end of the season. The team's decision proved to be correct, as Wilson rebounded in 2000, hitting 37 home runs with 89 RBIs to win his second Best Nine Award.\nWilson sustained another injury in 2001, and left the team after playing only 34 games that year then was picked up by the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes the following year, but could not repeat his earlier success. He left Japan at the end of 2002, and signed a minor league contract with the New York Yankees organization, but did not make it into a major league roster.\nWilson is remembered as one of the best non-Japanese players ever to play for the Nippon Ham Fighters, along with Tony Solaita and Sherman Obando.\nPersonal.\nWilson's father was a cricket player from Trinidad.\nWilson resides in Ajax, Ontario with his wife, Natalie Wilson and their three children, Morgan, Paris and Quinton.\nHe also has an older daughter, LaToya Forever, a YouTube personality who and cast member of The Real Housewives of Atlanta.\nWilson has owned and run the Competitive Edge sports training facility in Ajax since 2008.\nWilson has coached many successful college players."

Typically, this series takes place in October, so playing in October is the goal of any major league team. Reggie Jackson's moniker \"Mr. October\" indicates that he played with great distinction in the World Series for the Yankees. Another Yankee, Derek Jeter, picked up the nickname \"Mr. November\" after he hit a walk-off home run in Game4 of the 2001 World Series just after midnight local time on November1. By comparison, Yankees owner George Steinbrenner's dubbing another of his players (Dave Winfield) \"Mr. May\" expressed his disappointment with that player's performance in the Fall Classic.\nThe one time the Fall Classic was actually played in the summer was 1918, when the season was curtailed due to World War I and the Series was played in early September.\nThe first time the Fall Classic extended in to November was in 2001. Jeter's walk-off homer was the first plate appearance in the month of November in MLB history; the 2001 season had been delayed for several days following 9/11, eventually pushing the start of the World Series into the last week of October – and the end of the Series in to November.

This term is mainly used for change ups and split-fingered fastballs, and occasionally for an overhand curveball.\nfan.\nTo \"fan\" a batter is to strike him out, especially a swinging strike three.\nfan interference.\nWhen a fan or any person not associated with one of the teams alters play in progress (in the judgment of an umpire), it is fan interference. The ball becomes dead, and the umpire will award any bases or charge any outs that, in his judgment, would have occurred without the interference. This is one of several types of interference calls in baseball.\nIf a fan touches a ball that is out of the field of play, such as a pop fly into the stands, it is not considered to be fan interference even if a defensive player might have fielded the ball successfully. So the infamous case in Game6 of the NLCS in which a Chicago Cubs fan, Steve Bartman, attempted to catch a ball in foul territory thereby possibly preventing Cubs left fielder Moisés Alou from making a circus catch, was not a case of fan interference.\nfancy Dan.\nA fielder who puts an extra flourish on his movements while making a play in hopes of gaining the approval of the spectators. Wilbert Robinson was manager when Al López started out as a catcher in the majors. Robinson watched Lopez' style and finally hollered, \"Tell that punk he got two hands to catch with! Never mind the stuff.\" Lopez went on to eventually surpass Robinson's record of games behind the plate.\nfarm team.\nA farm team is a team or club whose role it is to provide experience and training for young players, with an expectation that successful players will move to the big leagues at some point. Each Major League Baseball team's organization has a farm system of affiliated farm teams at different minor league baseball levels.\nfastball.\nA pitch that is thrown more for high velocity than for movement; it is the most common type of pitch. Also known as smoke, a bullet, a heater (the heat generated by the ball can be felt), the express (as opposed to the local, an offspeed pitch), or a hummer (the ball cannot be seen, only heard).\nfastball count.\nA count in which the pitcher would be ordinarily expected to throw a fastball, such as 3–1, 3–2, or 2–1, as fast ball are usually easiest to locate in the strike zone. Occasionally a pitcher will pull the string by throwing an off-speed pitch.\nfastball happy.\nWhen a pitcher relies too much on his fastball, perhaps because his other pitches are not working well for him during that game, he is said to be \"fastball happy\". This can get a pitcher into trouble if the batters can anticipate that the next pitch will be a fastball. \"Andy is at his best when he trusts his breaking stuff and doesn't try to overpower guys. When he gets fastball happy he gets knocked around.\"\nfat pitch.\nA pitch that is located exactly where the hitter is expecting it. The ball may look bigger than it actually is, and the batter may hit it a long way.\nfeed.\nTo throw the ball carefully to another fielder in a way that allows him to make an out. A first-baseman who has just fielded a ground ball will \"feed the ball\" to the pitcher who is running over from the mound to make the force out at first base. An infielder who has fielded a ground-ball will feed the ball to the player covering second base so the latter can step on the base and quickly throw to first base to complete a double play.\nfencebuster.\nA slugger.\nfielder.\nAny defensive player (the offense being batters and runners). Often, defensive players are distinguished as either pitchers or position players. Position players are further divided into infielders and outfielders.\nfield manager.\nThe head coach of a team is called the manager (more formally, the field manager). He controls team strategy on the field. He sets the line-up and starting pitcher before each game as well as making substitutions throughout the game. In modern baseball the field manager is normally subordinate to the team's general manager (or GM), who among other things is responsible for personnel decisions, including hiring and firing the field manager. However, the term manager used without qualification almost always refers to the field manager.\nfielder's choice.\nA fielder's choice (FC) is the act of a fielder, upon fielding a batted ball, choosing to try to putout a baserunner and allow the batter-runner to advance to first base. Despite reaching first base safely after hitting the ball, the batter is not credited with a hit but would be charged with an at-bat.\nfigger filbert.\nAn old-fashioned and more colorful way of saying \"numbers nut\", for a fan with a near-obsessive interest in the statistics or \"figures\" of the game. The first true \"figger filbert\" was probably Ernest Lanigan, who was the first historian of the Baseball Hall of Fame and prior to that was one of the first, if not \"the\" first, to publish an encyclopedia of baseball stats, in the 1920s. In the modern era, Bill James could be said to be the iconic \"figger filbert\". He is also a founding father of the field of baseball research called sabermetrics.\nfight off a pitch.\nWhen a batter has two strikes on him and gets a pitch he cannot hit cleanly, he may be said to \"fight off the pitch\" by fouling it off. \"Langerhans fought off one 3-2 pitch, then drove the next one to the gap in left-center to bring home the tying and winning runs.\"\nfilthy.\nA compliment for a pitcher, especially one who specializes in breaking balls with a lot of movement. Also for a particularly impressive breaking ball, especially one thrown for a third strike. Synonymous with \"nasty\". Bert Blyleven was an example of a pitcher with an absolutely filthy curveball.\nfind a hole.\nTo get a base hit by hitting the ball between infielders. \"The 13th groundball that Zachry allowed found a hole.\"\nfind his bat.\nWhen a batter has been in a slump perhaps for no evident reason, but then starts getting hits, he may be said to have \"found his bat\". \"With the Tigers having found their bats for a night, they reset the series and put themselves in position to all but lock up the AL Central.\"\nfind his swing.\nWhen a batter has experienced a slump, he may take extra practice or instruction to \"find his swing\". Perhaps he has a hitch in his swing, or his batting stance has changed. Having \"lost his swing\", now he must \"find it\". This phrase is also used in golf.\nfind the seats.\nAs if a ball leaving the bat is in search of a place to land, a ball that \"finds the seats\" is one that leaves the field of play and reaches the stands. It may either be a home run or a foul ball (out of the reach of the fielders).\nfireballer.\nA pitcher who throws extremely high-velocity fastballs, in excess of 95 miles per hour. A flamethrower.\nfireman.\nA team's top relief pitcher who is often brought in to end an offensive rally and \"put out the fire\". The term has been attributed to New York Daily News cartoonist Bruce Stark, who in the 1970s first depicted relievers for the New York Mets and Yankees as firemen coming in to save their teams from danger.\nfireplug.\nA player, often one of small stature, who is known for his energy, extroversion, and team spirit – sometimes perhaps more than for his playing ability. \"Morgan defied this mold by outworking everybody and employing his moderate athletic gifts to become one of the best all-around players of his era. He hit for power, he hit for average, he stole bases and manufactured runs and he was one of the toughest, smartest defensive second basemen the game has ever seen. He was a relentless fireplug, respected by opposing players and hated by opposing fans.\"\nfirst-ball hitter.\nA hitter who likes to hit the first pitch in an at bat, especially if the hitter often gets a hit on the first pitch.\nfisted.\nWhen a batter swings at a pitch that is inside and the ball hits the bat close to his fists (hands). \"Following the top half of the first, the Bulls offense struck early when junior leftfielder Junior Carlin fisted a pitch back up the middle on a 1–0 count.\"\nfive and dive.\nA derogatory term referring to a starting pitcher who is unable to go beyond five innings before wearing out. In the current era in which managers are increasingly aware of the risk of injury to pitchers who have high pitch counts, and in which relief pitching has become a critical part of the game, starters achieve fewer and fewer complete games. Headline: \"Vasquez Disputes Five-and-Dive Label\".\nfive o'clock hitter.\nA hitter who hits really well during batting practice, but not so well during games. These were formerly known as \"ten o'clock hitters\" or \"two-o'clock hitters\" back when there were no night games.\nfive-tool player.\nA position player who has great skill in all the tools or basic skills: hitting for average, hitting for power, base running and speed, throwing, and fielding. See tools for how baseball scouts rate these skills.\nFL or F.L..\nAbbreviation for Federal League, a major league that existed from 1914 to 1915. This would be the last \"third Major League\" to come into existence.\nflag down.\nTo catch or knock down a line drive, as if flagging down a speeding train. \"Cody Ross, who singled and moved to second on a ground-out, was stranded when Ramírez's scorched liner... was flagged down by a diving Jones.\"\nflamethrower.\nA fireballer.\nflare.\nA fly ball hit a short distance into the outfield. \"Pudge hit a flare just out of the shortstop's reach.\"\nflashing the leather.\nMaking an outstanding or difficult defensive play. A player who regularly makes difficult defensive plays may be described as a \"leather flasher\". See leather.\nfloater.\nA knuckleball. A pitch that may appear to the batter to float or bob up and down on its way to the plate.\nfluke hit.\nA base hit that results from a weakly batted ball or one that takes an odd bounce.\nflutterball.\nA knuckleball, a floater.\nfly ball.\nA ball hit high in the air. See also pop fly, infield fly, and ground ball.\nfly ball pitcher.\nA pitcher who tends to induce more fly balls than ground balls. Those pitchers are disadvantageous in that they allow more home runs than any other pitcher.\nforce play.\nWhen a runner must advance to another base because the batter becomes a runner and, as such, must advance to first base. In this situation, the runner is out if a fielder with the ball touches the base the runner is being forced to; this is considered a \"force out\". A play when a fly ball is caught and a fielder touches a base prior to the runner tagging up is not a force play, but an appeal play.\nforkball.\nA type of split-finger fastball or splitter in which the fingers are spread out as far as possible. The ball drops sharply and typically out of the strike zone, maybe even into the dirt.\nfoul ball.\nA batted ball that settles into foul territory.\nfoul lines.\nTwo straight lines drawn on the ground from home plate to the outfield fence to indicate the boundary between fair territory and foul territory. These are called either the left-field foul line and the right-field foul line, or the third-base foul line and first-base foul line, respectively. The foul poles on the outfield walls are vertical extensions of the foul lines.\nDespite their names, both the foul lines and the foul poles are in \"fair\" territory. Any fly ball that strikes the foul line (including the foul pole) beyond first or third base is a fair ball (and in the case of the foul pole, a home run).\nNote that while the foul lines in baseball are in fair territory, just like the side- and end-lines of a tennis court, in basketball or American football the sidelines are considered out of bounds. In other words, hitting the ball \"on the line\" is good for the offensive player in baseball and tennis, but stepping on the line is bad for the offensive player in basketball and American football. The situation is slightly different in association football (soccer): the sideline and the goal line are inbounds, and the ball is out of play when it has wholly crossed the side line (touch line) or the goal line, whether on the ground or in the air.\nfoul off.\nPurposely batting a pitch foul with two strikes in order to keep the at-bat going, in part to tire the pitcher and in part to get another, different pitch that might be easier to hit. Luke Appling was said to be the king of \"fouling them off\". Such a hitter might also be said to be battling or working the pitcher.\nfoul pole.\nA pole located on each foul line on the outfield fence or wall. The left-field foul pole and right-field foul pole are used by umpires to determine whether a batted ball is a home run or a foul ball. The foul pole is a vertical extension of the foul line. The term \"foul pole\" is actually a misnomer, because the \"foul pole\" (like the foul line) is in fair territory and a fly ball that hits the foul pole is considered to be a fair ball (and a home run).\nfoul tip.\nA batted ball that is hit sharply and directly from the bat to the catcher's mitt and legally caught by the catcher. It is not a foul tip, as most announcers and journalists mistakenly use the term, if the ball is not caught by the catcher. In this case, it is simply a foul ball. It is also not considered a foul tip if it rebounds off something, like the ground, catcher's mask, the batter, etc. after being struck by the bat but before touching the catcher's mitt. A foul tip is considered in play, not a foul ball, and also counts as a strike, including the third strike (and is also considered a strikeout for the pitcher). It is signalled by the umpire putting his right hand flat in the air and brushing his left hand against it (imitating the ball glancing off the bat) and then using his standard strike call. If the out is not the third out then the ball is alive and in play (unlike on a foul) and runners are in jeopardy if they are trying to advance.\nfour-bagger.\nA home run. Note that the 4th \"bag\" is actually a plate.\nfour-fingered salute.\nAn intentional base on balls, from the manager's signal to direct the pitcher to issue one, or to direct the umpire to award the batter first base.\nfour-seam fastball.\nA standard fastball, which does not necessarily break though a good one will have movement as well as velocity and location that makes it difficult to hit. The batter sees the four parallel seams spin toward him. A four-seamer. See two-seamer.\nfree baseball.\nSlang for extra innings. The fans get to see extra innings \"for free\".\nfree pass.\nA base on balls. \"Free\" because the batter does not have to hit the ball to get on base. Also referred to as a \"free ticket\" and an Annie Oakley.\nfreeze the hitter.\nTo throw a strike that is so unexpected or in such a location that the batter doesn't swing at it. \"As Cashman spoke, Pettitte fired a strike on the corner, which froze the hitter.\" \"But the right-hander reached in her bag of tricks and threw a tantalizing changeup that froze the hitter for the final out.\"\nfriendly confines.\nA nickname for Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs.\nfrozen rope.\nA hard-hit line drive. Also a strong throw from the outfield.\nfull count.\nA count of 3 balls and 2 strikes; another strike will result in a strikeout, while another ball will result in a walk. At that point, only a foul ball will extend the at-bat.\nfungo.\nA fly ball hit for fielders to practice catching. It is not part of the game, but is accomplished by a batter tossing the ball a short distance up in the air and then batting it himself.\nfungo bat.\nA lightweight bat with a long, skinny barrel used to hit fungoes. It is not a legal or safe bat to use in a game or even in practice with a live pitcher, because it is too light.\nG.\ngood piece of hitting.\nA situation where a batter puts the ball in play in a way that maximizes the result for his team. \"Good pieces of hitting\" tend to result in runs scoring and draining several pitches out of an opposing pitcher, especially in situations where the pitcher's team was looking for a decent amount of length.\ngot to him early.\nWhen a team's batters gets several hits and runs off of the opposing starting pitcher in early innings the batters are said to \"get to him early\".\ngot under the ball.\nWhen a hitter swings slightly under the center of the pitched ball, thereby leading to a high fly ball out instead of a home run, he's said to \"get under the ball\".\nH.\nhitter.\na person who hits a ball with a bat in baseball.\nhome run trot.\nUnfortunately for his personal power totals, Milledge was bamboozled into believing his liner in the fourth inning against the Chicago Cubs on Thursday night had cleared the left-field fence at PNC Park for his first career grand slam. Dead certain he had gone deep, Milledge raised his fist rounding first base, put his head down and went into a trot. Cool. Double-dog certain because the fireworks guy at PNC set off the pyrotechnics that explode every time a Bucs player goes deep. Music also began to blare. What a glorious moment for the Bucs!... only, the ball had not cleared the fence. It hit the top and stayed in the field of play.\nAs Bucs announcer Bob Walk said, \"Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh—we got a problem here.\" Milledge was not quite midway between second and third base when he realized the Cubs had him in a rundown. And, yeah, um, he was tagged out. Score that a two-run double and a big ol' base-running blunder.\nI.\ninherited runner.\nInherited runners or inherited baserunners are the runners on base when a relief pitcher enters the game. Since a previous pitcher has allowed these runners to reach base (or was simply pitching when the runners reached base, such as in the case of a fielding error), any inherited runners who score when the relief pitcher is pitching are charged to the previous pitcher's \"runs allowed\" and/or earned runs allowed total, depending on how each runner reached base. Modern box scores list how many runners each relief pitcher inherits (if any), and how many of those inherited runners the relief pitcher allows to score, called inherited runs allowed (IRA).\ninnings eater.\nThe success of most pitchers is based on statistics such as won-loss record, ERA or saves, but the unsung \"innings eater\" is judged by how many innings he pitches and the impact his work has on the rest of the staff. \"I don't have a whole lot of goals going into the season. I don't shoot for a certain ERA or a certain strikeout number or certain number of wins,\" says Blanton, entering his second full season. \"I try to go out and get a quality start every time, six innings or more, and not miss any starts. I feel if I can do that, I'll get my 200 innings in a year and everything else falls into place with that.\"\nS.\nstand-up double or triple (or \"standing\"/\"standing up\").\nAn extra-base hit in which the runner reaches base easily without needing to slide, i.e. remains standing up as he touches the bag. Also referred to simply as \"standing\" i.e. \"the runner from 3rd base scores standing (up).\"\nT.\ntools of ignorance.\nDifferent sources have credited Muddy Ruel and Bill Dickey with coining the phrase."

        "text": "Polymerase cycling assembly (or PCA, also known as Assembly PCR) is a method for the assembly of large DNA oligonucleotides from shorter fragments. The process uses the same technology as PCR, but takes advantage of DNA hybridization and annealing as well as DNA polymerase to amplify a complete sequence of DNA in a precise order based on the single stranded oligonucleotides used in the process. It thus allows for the production of synthetic genes and even entire synthetic genomes.\nPCA principles.\nMuch like how primers are designed such that there is a forward primer and a reverse primer capable of allowing DNA polymerase to fill the entire template sequence, PCA uses the same technology but with multiple oligonucleotides. While in PCR the customary size of oligonucleotides used is 18 base pairs, in PCA lengths of up to 50 are used to ensure uniqueness and correct hybridization.\nEach oligonucleotide is designed to be either part of the top or bottom strand of the target sequence. As well as the basic requirement of having to be able to tile the entire target sequence, these oligonucleotides must also have the usual properties of similar melting temperatures, hairpin free, and not too GC rich to avoid the same complications as PCR.\nDuring the polymerase cycles, the oligonucleotides anneal to complementary fragments and then are filled in by polymerase. Each cycle thus increases the length of various fragments randomly depending on which oligonucleotides find each other. It is critical that there is complementarity between all the fragments in some way or a final complete sequence will not be produced as polymerase requires a template to follow.\nAfter this initial construction phase, additional primers encompassing both ends are added to perform a regular PCR reaction, amplifying the target sequence away from all the shorter incomplete fragments. A gel purification can then be used to identify and isolate the complete sequence.\nTypical reaction.\nA typical reaction consists of oligonucleotides ~50 base pairs long each overlapping by about 20 base pairs. The reaction with all the oligonucleotides is then carried out for ~30 cycles followed by an additional 23 cycles with the end primers.\nGibson assembly.\nA modification of this method, Gibson assembly, described by Gibson et al. allows for single-step isothermal assembly of DNA with up to several hundreds kb. By using T5 exonuclease to 'chew back' complementary ends, an overlap of about 40bp can be created. The reaction takes place at 50 °C, a temperature where the T5 exonuclease is unstable. After a short timestep it is degraded, the overlaps can anneal and be ligated. Cambridge University IGEM team made a video describing the process. Ligation independent cloning (LIC) is a new variant of the method for compiling several DNA pieces together and needing only exonuclease enzyme for the reaction. "

        "text": "Listed below are the Major League Baseball teams with the best season win–loss records, as determined by winning percentage (.700 or better).\nSeason records.\nSince the season was expanded to 162 games in 1961, only two teams have managed a winning percentage of .700 or higher in a full season (which requires 114 or more wins): the 1998 New York Yankees and the 2001 Seattle Mariners.\nPre-1886 teams.\nWith shorter schedules (fewer than 100 games before 1884), it was more common for teams to finish with .700 or better winning percentages, as there was less of the evening-out effect of a longer season, and some seasons had multiple teams, with three in 1884 (between the three leagues that year) and in 1885.\nIn the list below (minimum 15 games played), six teams finished with better overall winning percentages than the 1906 Cubs, three being in the early years of the National league, and the other three in leagues whose status as \"major\" is questionable: two in the National Association, whose status as a major league has long been disputed, and the other in the Union Association, which is conventionally listed as a major league, but this has been questioned due to the league's overall lack of playing talent and poor organizational structure.\nIn addition, contemporary baseball guides did not consider the Union Association to be a major league: the earliest record referencing the Union Association as a major league dates to 1922.)\nThe all-time best single season record belongs to the Cincinnati Red Stockings, who posted baseball's only perfect record at 67–0 (57–0 against National Association of Base Ball Players clubs) in 1869, prior to Major League baseball. Their record stretched to 81–0 across the 1870 season before losing 8–7 in eleven innings to the Brooklyn Atlantics in Brooklyn on June 14."

        "text": "The 1988 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 1987–88 season, and the culmination of the 1988 Stanley Cup playoffs. It was contested between the Edmonton Oilers and Boston Bruins. The Oilers would win the series in a four game sweep to win their fourth championship. This was the seventh of nine consecutive Finals contested by a team from Western Canada, sixth of eight by a team from Alberta (the Oilers appeared in six of them, the Calgary Flames in two, and the Vancouver Canucks in one), and the last of five consecutive Finals to end with the Cup presentation on Alberta ice (the Oilers won four such Cups, the Montreal Canadiens the other). The series is remembered for the power failure that occurred during game four at Boston Garden, which caused that game to be suspended. The league decided to replay game four at Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton, at the site, date and time that was originally scheduled for game five. Game 5 is also the final time that Wayne Gretzky appeared in an Edmonton Oilers uniform as he was traded to Los Angeles just prior to the next season.\nPaths to the Finals.\nThe Oilers cruised into the Finals with relative ease, losing only two games in the process. They beat the Winnipeg Jets in five games, swept the Calgary Flames, and then beat the Detroit Red Wings in five to win the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl for the fifth time in six years.\nThe Bruins, meanwhile, had a much harder road. It took them six games to knock off the Buffalo Sabres, then beat their longtime rivals the Montreal Canadiens in five games, and then needed the full seven games to beat the New Jersey Devils to claim the Prince of Wales Trophy.\nGame summaries.\nThe Finals pitted the Oilers' offensive juggernaut against the Bruins' more balanced team. The Oilers showed their defensive prowess, surrendering just nine goals in the four completed games. Ray Bourque was physical in defending against Gretzky, but that would not ground the \"Great One\" on his way to claiming his second Conn Smythe Trophy and setting playoff records with 31 assists in just 18 games, and 13 points in the Finals series.\nGame one.\nSummary\nGame two.\nSummary\nGame three.\nSummary\nGame four (suspended).\nGlenn Anderson set a new record for quickest goal from the start of a Finals game when he scored ten seconds into the contest. That record was tied two years later in the third game of the Finals by John Byce who, in a twist, was playing for the Bruins \"against\" the Oilers. Fog interfered with the game, requiring stoppages during the second period so that all 40+ players could skate around the ice to clear it away. The Oilers scored with 3:23 left in the second period, tying the game at 3–3, then the arena suffered a power failure before the ensuing face-off. The teams were sent to their dressing room untilafter a very long delay and no change in the situationNHL President John Ziegler Jr. announced that the game was suspended. Despite the game being suspended and replayed, Anderson's record is official.\nGame four was subsequently rescheduled and moved to Edmonton, which was originally set to be the site of a game five if necessary. The Oilers won that game, sweeping the series and winning their fourth Stanley Cup in five years. Had the Bruins extended the series to the full seven games, game five would have been played on the original date for game six in Boston, Edmonton would have hosted the rescheduled game six, and then game seven would have been played in Boston as the makeup game.\nGame four.\nSummary\nSeries summary.\nBoston Bruins vs. Edmonton Oilers\n\"Edmonton wins best-of-seven series 4–0\"\nTeam rosters.\nYears indicated in boldface under the \"Finals appearance\" column signify that the player won the Stanley Cup in the given year.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1988 Stanley Cup was presented to Oilers captain Wayne Gretzky by NHL President John Ziegler following the Oilers 6–3 win over the Bruins in game four.\nThe following Oilers players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1987–88 Edmonton Oilers\nGretzky wanted every member of the Oilers to be included on the team picture. However, when the cup was engraved all five scouts were left off: Garnet Bailey, Ed Chadwick, Lorne Davis, Matti Vaisanen (on the Cup in 1985, 1987, 1990), Bob Freeman (part time, not on the Cup). The Oilers also left three players off the Stanley Cup: Daryl Reaugh, Steve Dykstra, Jim Weimer. Bill Tuele (Public Relations Director) had his name added to the cup for the first time. He has rings with the Oilers in 1984, 1985, 1987, but his name was not put on the Stanley Cup those seasons.\nBroadcasting.\nIn the United States, this was the final year under ESPN's national three-year deal. Under the U.S. TV contracts that would take effect beginning next season, SportsChannel America would take over as the NHL's American television partner.\nESPN's coverage of the 1988 Cup Finals was blacked out locally in the Boston area due to WSBK and NESN's local rights to Bruins games.\nIn Canada, this was the second and final year that the English-language rights to the Cup Finals was split between the Global-Canwest consortium and the CBC. Global aired games one and two. The CBC aired game three, then both the original and replayed game fours. CBC had the rights to game 5 of the Stanley Cup Finals, and Canwest/Global also had the rights to games 6 &amp; 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals between Edmonton Oilers and Boston Bruins (both CBC and Canwest/Global had the rights of Game 7, using separate production facilities and separate on-air talent), which were not necessary."

        "title": "Baseball Card Adventures",
        "text": "The Baseball Card Adventures is a novel series written by Dan Gutman. There are 12 books in the series, published by HarperCollins between 1997 and 2015. The books feature a boy, Joe Stoshack, who can travel through time when he touches old baseball cards. When he holds a baseball card, he feels a tingling sensation, and when it gets strong, is transported to the year that card was made and somewhere near the ballplayer on the card. Later he discovers that this power also works on very old photographs. He tries to use this power wisely, and he attempts to change history several times, but the result is always something different from his original goal.\nThe novels are typically illustrated with black and white photos from the time period in which the story takes place. For example, when Jackie Robinson steals second base in \"Jackie &amp; Me\", a real photograph of Jackie Robinson stealing a base is pictured. Occasionally the books will also be illustrated with pictures taken exclusively for the book.\n\"The Cambridge Companion to Baseball\" in its review of baseball fiction calls the books \"an eclectic enterprise\" which \"uninhibitedly embraces the genre's cliches.\" \"Library Journal\" called them \"good examples\" of traditional sports novels.\nThe books.\n\"Honus &amp; Me\".\nJoe Stoshack discovers the T206 Honus Wagner, the most valuable baseball card in the world, while cleaning out an Ms. Amanda Young's attic. She is over 100 years old. Stoshack brings the card to a former bad guy wrestler, Birdie Farell. He tries to trick Joe into giving it to him for $10. Joe refuses. He uses it to travel back in time to 1909. Once Joe is in 1909, he discovers that he became a grown man. Joe helps Honus Wagner win the 7th game of the 1909 World Series, and travels back to the present to return the card to his neighbor. In 1909 he discovered Ms. Young is really Wagner's old girlfriend, and sends her back in time to be with him again.\n\"Jackie &amp; Me\".\nJoe Stoshack was a ten year old boy who was assigned to do a book report on Jackie Robinson for black history month. Joe goes to Flip Valentini and borrows a 1947 Jackie Robinson card.\nJoe went back in time on the exact day Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier between the black league and the white league. Joe experiences what it is like to be an African American in a segregated society when he travels back to 1947 to watch Jackie Robinson play, and while going back in time he accidentally himself turns black. He tries to bring back a bunch of Jackie Robinson cards, but the cards are stolen by the Dodgers' batboy, Anthony. Joe wants to go after him, but Jackie tells him it's not safe. In the story, Joe also meets Jackie's wife and son, Jackie Jr. Joe also meets Flip Valentini as a kid and gives him advice.\n\"School Library Journal\" called it \"readable and accurate\".\n\"Babe &amp; Me\".\nWitnesses never agreed whether Babe Ruth called his shot. Like other baseball fans, Joe Stoshack wants to know the truth. Joe Stoshack and his father Bill travel back to the year 1932 and catch Babe Ruth's called shot in Game 3 of the 1932 World Series against the Chicago Cubs.\n\"Shoeless Joe &amp; Me\".\nAfter Flip tells Stosh about the Black Sox Scandal, Stosh thinks that Shoeless Joe is innocent, and he goes back in time to try to stop it from ever happening. When he gets to 1919, three gamblers lock him in a closet because he knew about the scandal. Shoeless Joe's wife, Katie sets Stosh free and he tells Katie and Joe about the scandal. He fails to stop it but he saves his great-great uncle from dying from Influenza.\n\"Mickey &amp; Me\".\nJoe's dad gets in a car crash, and fearing he might die, tells Joe his inheritance: a Mickey Mantle rookie baseball card. He tells Joe to go back and prevent the terrible accident that negatively impacted Mantle's baseball career, so Joe travels back to 1951. However, Joe's cousin Samantha switches the Mantle card for a catcher of a women's league team, Dorothy Maguire. When he goes back in time he took the job for the mascot of the Milwaukee Chicks.\n\"Abner &amp; Me\".\nJoe goes back in time to see if Abner Doubleday really invented baseball. This is the first and only story in the series where Stosh's mom travels through time. The two land in a war, and help fight with a group of kids. Stosh's mom helps save an injured person's life by using modern day medical techniques. The doctor is quite impressed. Soon Joe finds Abner, and gets the answer for his question in a very interesting way.\n\"Satch &amp; Me\".\nStosh and Flip Valentini go back in time with a radar gun to find out how fast Satchel Paige's pitching really was. Unfortunately, they never get to find out, attempting to do so several times only to have something go wrong in the last minute. Then Joe Stoshack leaves Flip Valentini in the past in a climactic chase scene, and Flip lives his life over again.\n\"Jim &amp; Me\".\nJoe and his enemy Bobby Fuller go back to 1913, where they meet Jim Thorpe, Bobby Fuller's great-grandfather. However, along the way they have several disagreements and fights.\n\"Ray &amp; Me\".\nAfter Joe is hit in the head by a baseball and wakes up after two weeks in a coma, he learns about another baseball player who wasn't so lucky – Ray Chapman. When Joe recovers from his accident, he goes back to 1920 and attempts to save Chapman from being fatally struck in the head with a baseball.\n\"Roberto &amp; Me\".\nJoe meets player and humanitarian Roberto Clemente, before traveling forward to 2080 to see the damage caused by global warming and he saves his Spanish teacher along the way.\n\"Ted &amp; Me\".\nAn FBI agent, who found out about Joe's power, comes and sends Joe back in time with a Ted Williams card to warn President Franklin D. Roosevelt about the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\"Willie &amp; Me\".\nOn the advice of Ralph Branca, Joe travels back to 1951 to try to prevent the \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\", one of the most controversial home runs in baseball history. However, he soon realizes that by doing so, he may forever alter the life of a young rookie named Willie Mays and not in a good way."

        "title": "2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)",
        "text": "The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) section of 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification was allocated four assured qualifying berths for the final tournament in South Africa and one place in a play-off. 43 teams were in the running for these spots, while Laos, Brunei and the Philippines did not enter qualification. This was the first time Timor-Leste competed in World Cup qualification and the first time Australia attempted to qualify for the World Cup as a member of the AFC, having moved from the Oceania Football Confederation at the start of 2006. Note that this edition saw the first effective participation of Myanmar. The country, called \"Burma\" until 1989, was registered three times (1950, 1994, 2002) but withdrew each time before playing.\nAsia's four automatic qualifying berths were taken by Australia, Japan and both North and South Korea. Bahrain failed to become a fifth Asian representative in the World Cup after losing the play-off match against Oceanian representatives New Zealand.\nSeeding.\nThe initial seeding (used in the draw for the first two rounds) was based on each team's performance during the qualification stage for the previous World Cup. The admission of Australia to the AFC complicated matters slightly (as they had not taken part in the previous AFC qualification cycle, but had progressed to the World Cup finals in Germany – and had advanced further than the AFC qualifiers).\nInitially, the AFC placed Australia as the first seed even though this contradicted the letter of the seeding – past practice (such as adopted by the AFC in the draw for the qualification to the 2008 Olympic Football Tournament) would have seeded Australia last.\nBy the time of the main qualification draw in Durban (which included the AFC third round), the seeding had been adjusted to rank the top 5 AFC nations according to their performance in the \"World Cup Final Tournament\" (of 2006). This resulted in minor changes to the seeding at that point.\nSeeding for the first two rounds.\nTeams ranked 1–5 received a bye from the first two knockout rounds and are entered into the third round.\nTeams ranked 6–43 entered at the first round, with teams ranked from 6–24 drawn against teams ranked from 25 to 43.\nOf the first round winners, the eight lowest remaining seeds would go on to play in the second round. The other teams would receive a bye to the third round.\nFirst round.\nThe official draw took place on 6 August 2007 at the AFC House in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Teams from Pot A were randomly paired with a team from Pot B.\nSecond round.\nOf the nineteen teams that progressed from the first round, the eight lowest seeded teams by FIFA rankings were required to play in the second round (the other eleven teams received a bye to the third round). As with the first round the draw took place on 6 August 2007 at AFC House in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\nAs the teams involved were not known at the time, the draw placed teams ranked 16–19 against teams ranked 12–15. The ties drawn were\nThird round.\nThe top 5 seeds were joined by the eleven highest-ranked winners from the first round and the four second round winners.\nQualified teams.\n1 On 30 October 2007, the Kuwait Football Association was suspended from international football competitions by FIFA. On 9 November 2007, Kuwait was conditionally reinstated to international football competitions by FIFA.\nSeeding.\nThese 20 teams were drawn into five groups of four teams at the main group draw in Durban, South Africa on 25 November 2007. The seeding for the main draw was the same for the first two rounds, with the exception that the five seeded nations (those that qualified for the 2006 finals) were ordered on the basis of results in the 2006 finals tournament. This saw Iran move from fifth to third, and Japan and Saudi Arabia ranked equal fourth.\nThe four seeding Pots used were:\nGroups.\nThe teams in each group played each other twice, once home and once away. The teams that finished first and second in their group qualified for the fourth round.\nGroup 1.\nOn 26 May 2008, FIFA decided to suspend Iraq from all international competitions after the Iraq Football Association was disbanded by the government on 20 May 2008. The suspension was provisionally and conditionally lifted on 29 May 2008.\nQatar fielded ineligible player Emerson in the 2–0 defeat to Iraq on 26 March 2008, prompting FIFA to controversially suspend him but clear Qatar of any wrongdoing, in direct contradiction to its decisions against Singapore.\nIraq appealed the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport but it was rejected by the CAS, saying that Iraq submitted documents and appeal fees too late.\nFourth round.\nIn the fourth round, the 10 remaining teams were drawn into 2 groups of 5 teams.\nSeeding.\nThe 10 qualifiers were drawn into two groups of five teams at the draw in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on 27 June 2008. The seeding for the fourth round was based on that used in the third round draw, but Saudi Arabia and Japan (seeded equal 4th in that draw) were separated by a random selection held at the start of the fourth round draw.\nThe top 6 ranked qualifiers were split into 3 pots of 2 teams, with the bottom 4 ranked nations grouped together in a separate pot. Each group was allocated 1 team from each of Pots 1, 2 and 3, and 2 teams from Pot 4.\nGroups.\nThe teams in each group played each other twice, once home and once away. The top 2 teams in each group qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup Finals in South Africa. The third-placed teams met in a play-off to determine who would play the OFC winner, New Zealand, in a separate playoff for a spot in the Finals.\nFifth round.\nTeams finishing 3rd in the fourth round groups played each other to determine a possible 5th qualifier from Asia. The draw for the order in which the two matches would be played was held on 2 June 2009 during the FIFA Congress in Nassau, the Bahamas.\nBahrain advanced to the Asia-Oceania play-off on the away goals rule.\nInter-confederation play-offs.\nThe Fifth Round winner then played the winner of the OFC qualifying group, New Zealand, in a home-and-away play-off. The winner of this play-off qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup finals.\nThe draw for the order in which the two matches would be played was held on 2 June 2009 during the FIFA Congress in Nassau, the Bahamas.\nQualified teams.\nThe following four teams from AFC qualified for the final tournament.\nTop goalscorers.\nBelow are full goalscorer lists for each round:"

        "title": "1989 Stanley Cup Finals",
        "text": "The 1989 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 1988–89 season, and the culmination of the 1989 Stanley Cup playoffs. It was contested between the Calgary Flames and the Montreal Canadiens, the top two teams during the regular season. This was the second time in the decade after 1986 that the Canadiens and Flames met in the Finals. The 1989 series remains to date the last time that two Canadian teams faced each other for the Stanley Cup.\nThe Flames defeated the Canadiens in six games to win their first and only Stanley Cup. The winning goal in game six was scored by Doug Gilmour. They became the first team to win a Stanley Cup after relocating, as they had begun life as the Atlanta Flames in 1972. Since then, four more teams have accomplished this feat: the New Jersey Devils (formerly the Kansas City Scouts and Colorado Rockies), the Colorado Avalanche (formerly the Quebec Nordiques), the Dallas Stars (formerly the Minnesota North Stars), and the Carolina Hurricanes (formerly the New England/Hartford Whalers). The Flames later reached the Finals again in , losing to the Tampa Bay Lightning; they had gone that entire span without a single playoff series victory. This was also the second-to-last of eight consecutive Finals where either the Flames or their provincial rival Edmonton Oilers represented Alberta in the Stanley Cup Finals and the second-to-last of nine consecutive Finals in which either the Flames or their Western Canada rivals represented that area in the Stanley Cup Finals, as featured the Vancouver Canucks, the Flames' rivals in Western Canada. Both Calgary and Montreal were the only two teams to win the Stanley Cup in the 1980s other than the New York Islanders and the Edmonton Oilers. This was the first time since 1975 that the Cup was won by a team other than the Canadiens, the Islanders, or the Oilers.\nThis was the Canadiens' first defeat in a Cup Finals since . Montreal later won the Finals again in , their most recent Finals victory. The defeat was Patrick Roy's only Cup Finals where he was not on the winning side; he went on to win the 1993 Cup with the Canadiens and the 1996 and 2001 Cups with the Avalanche.\nThe 1989 Finals featured two coaches making their first appearances, as Calgary's Terry Crisp faced Montreal's Pat Burns. For Crisp it was his only appearance, while Burns returned one more time in 2003 where he led the Devils to their third Cup. In the interim between their two matches both teams had replaced their coaches; Crisp was hired to replace Badger Bob Johnson after his departure following the 1987 season while Burns took over for 1986 Cup winning coach Jean Perron after his 1988 firing. For Crisp, this was his third Stanley Cup championship in his career. He had already won two as a player with the Philadelphia Flyers in 1974 and 1975. Following the series, Bob Gainey, Rick Green, and Lanny McDonald retired, while long time defenceman Larry Robinson signed with the Los Angeles Kings, where he played the final three years of his career.\nPaths to the Finals.\nCalgary defeated the Vancouver Canucks 4–3, the Los Angeles Kings 4–0 and the Chicago Blackhawks 4–1 to advance to the Final. In addition, the Flames path through the playoffs was made easier since their nemesis and reigning two-time defending cup champion, Edmonton Oilers, who had swept the Flames from the playoffs the previous year were eliminated by the Los Angeles Kings in the opening round.\nMontreal defeated the Hartford Whalers 4–0, the Boston Bruins 4–1 and the Philadelphia Flyers 4–2.\nGame summaries.\nCo-captain Lanny McDonald scored the second Flames goal in game six. This turned out to be the last goal in his Hockey Hall of Fame career because he retired during the following off-season. It was also his only Stanley Cup victory. Doug Gilmour scored two goals in the third period, including the eventual game and Cup winner to cement the victory for the Flames. Al MacInnis won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP, and at 31 points, became the first defenceman to lead the NHL in post-season scoring. The Calgary Flames are the only visiting team to ever win the Stanley Cup by defeating the Montreal Canadiens at the Montreal Forum. The only other visiting team to win the Stanley Cup at the Montreal Forum was the New York Rangers, when they defeated the Montreal Maroons in 1928.\nBroadcasting.\nThis was the first Cup Finals since 1984 that the CBC had the sole English-language rights to the entire series in Canada instead of having to share it with another network. This was also the first season that SportsChannel America held the national U.S rights.\nTeam rosters.\nYears indicated in boldface under the \"Finals appearance\" column signify that the player won the Stanley Cup in the given year.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1989 Stanley Cup was presented to Flames co-captains Lanny McDonald, Tim Hunter, and Jim Peplinski by NHL President John Ziegler following the Flames 4–2 win over the Canadiens in game six.\nThe following Flames players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1988–89 Calgary Flames\nStanley Cup Finals Patch.\nThe 1989 Stanley Cup Finals was the first to feature a special commemorative patch on both teams' sweaters, in honor of the championship series. Placed on each player's left shoulder, the patch employed the same design that was used from 1989 to 1994 before being tweaked for the 1995 Finals. A commemorative patch has been issued in every Stanley Cup Finals since, though subsequent patches were sewn onto the sweaters'` upper right breast area (with the only exceptions being the 1994 and 2014 New York Rangers, whose diagonal wordmark necessitated the patch's placement on the top of each sweater's left shoulder)."

        "title": "Zone defense in American football",
        "text": "Zone coverage (also referred to as a zone defense) is a defense scheme in gridiron football used to protect against the pass.\nZone coverage schemes require the linebackers and defensive backs to work together to cover certain areas of the field, making it difficult for the opposing quarterback to complete passes. Zone defenses will generally require linebackers to cover the short and midrange area in the middle of the field, in front of the safeties. In the case where one or two linebackers blitz, the remaining linebacker(s) expands his zone to cover the zone responsibilities of the vacating linebacker(s). Often, blitzing will leave larger holes in the pass defense, but it is a gamble the defensive coordinator wants to make to pressure the quarterback into a poor decision and hopefully an interception or at least an incompletion.\nCoverage shells.\nIn the following, \"cover\" refers to the \"shell\" that the defense rolls into after the snap of the ball, more specifically the number of defenders guarding the deep portion of the field.\nIn passing situations, the defense will assign players to guard portions of the field, forming a defensive \"shell\" that the defense hopes will either prevent the offense from completing a pass or ensure a defensive player is able to tackle the receiver after a completed pass. The general terminology used to describe this alignment is \"Cover #,\" with \"#\" being the number of defensive players forming the coverage shell.\nCover 0.\nCover 0 refers to pure man coverage with no deep defender. Similar to Cover 1, Cover 0 has the same strengths and weaknesses but employs an extra rusher at the expense of deep coverage help leaving each pass defender man-to-man. Cover 0 is an aggressive scheme that allows for numerous blitz packages, as it's easier for players to drop off their coverage and rush the quarterback. However, there is no \"help over the top\"—if a wide receiver \"beats\" (achieves separation from) his defender, there is no one left in the secondary who can make up the coverage on the receiver, which could result in an easy pass completion and possible touchdown.\nCover 1.\nCover One is a man-to-man coverage for all the defensive backs except for one player (usually a safety), who is not assigned a man to cover but rather plays deep and reacts to the development of the play. Often, the safety will remain in a pass coverage position and play a zone defense by guarding the middle of the secondary, reacting to runs or completed passes, and double-teaming a receiver if needed.\nIn a traditional Cover 1, the free safety plays deep, and all of the other defenders lock in man coverage for an assigned player for the duration of the play. Essentially, during the pre-snap read, each defender identifies the coverage responsibilities and does not change the assignment. Some teams play a variant of Cover 1 called Cover 7. In Cover 7, the free safety still plays deep, but the underneath coverage is much more flexible, and the defenders switch assignments as the play develops in an attempt to improve defensive positions to make a play on the ball. Examples of these switches include double covering a certain receiver and using defensive help to undercut a route to block a throwing lane.\nAdvantages.\nCover 1 schemes are usually very aggressive, preferring to proactively disrupt the offense by giving the quarterback little time to make a decision while collapsing the pocket quickly. This is the main advantage of Cover 1 schemes—the ability to blitz from various pre-snap formations while engaging in complex man-to-man coverage schemes post-snap. For example, a safety may blitz while a cornerback is locked in man coverage with a receiver. Or the cornerback may blitz with the safety rotating into man coverage on the receiver post-snap.\nDisadvantages.\nThe main weakness of the Cover 1 scheme is that there is only one deep defender that must cover a large amount of field and provide help on any deep threats. Offenses can attack Cover 1 schemes by sending two receivers on deep routes, provided that the quarterback has enough time for his receivers to get open. The deep defender must decide which receiver to help out on, leaving the other in man coverage which may be a mismatch.\nA secondary weakness is inherent in its design: the use of man coverage opens up yards after catch lanes. Man coverage is attacked by offenses in various ways that try to isolate their best athletes on defenders by passing them the ball quickly before the defender can react or designing plays that clear defenders from certain areas th,us opening yards after catch lanes.\nCover 2.\nIn traditional Cover 2 schemes, the free safety (FS) and strong safety (SS) have deep responsibilities, each guarding half of the field. The NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Indianapolis Colts, Chicago Bears, and New York Giants run a variant of this defense called the Tampa 2. The primary difference between traditional cover 2 and Tampa-2 is the responsibility of the middle linebacker. In traditional cover 2, the middle linebacker covers the underneath zone, with the two safeties taking responsibility for half of the field in the deep zone. Tampa 2 is a hybrid of cover 2 and cover 3 (see below) where the deep safeties have responsibility only for the deep zone \"outside the hashes,\" while the middle linebacker drops into the middle quarter of the field, covering deep passes between the hash marks. \nCover 2 can be run from any seven-man defensive fronts such as the 3-4 and the 4-3. (It is difficult to implement Cover 2 from an eight-in-the-box front, because the strong safety or someone replacing him is usually the eighth man.) Various \"underneath\" coverages played by cornerbacks and linebackers may also be implemented. For example, Cover 2 Man means 2 safeties have deep responsibility while the cornerbacks and linebackers follow their offensive assignments in one-on-one coverage. Cover 2 can also be paired with underneath zone schemes: Cover 2 Zone refers to 2 safeties with deep responsibility, but now the CBs and LBs drop back into specific coverage zones where they defend passes only in their assigned area.\nTeams that play Cover 2 shells usually subscribe to the \"bend-but-don't-break\" philosophy, preferring to keep offensive players in front of them for short gains while limiting long passes. This is in stark contrast to a more aggressive Cover 1 type scheme which leaves the offensive team's wide receivers in single man-to-man coverage with only one deep helper. By splitting the deep field between two defenders, the defense can drastically reduce the number of long gains.\nIn Cover 2, the cornerbacks are considered to be \"hard\" corners, meaning that they have increased run stopping responsibilities and generally defend against shorter passes, although if two receivers run a deep route on a certain side of the field, that side's corner has deep coverage responsibility as well. The \"hard\" corners also generally bear the responsibility of \"pressing\" or \"jamming\" the offensive receivers- disrupting the receivers' intended path downfield. It also relies heavily on the \"Mike\" (Middle) linebacker's ability to quickly drop deep downfield into pass coverage when he reads a pass.\nA variant of Cover 2 is the Inverted Cover 2, in which either right before or after the snap the corners \"bail\" out while the safeties come up—in effect switching responsibilities. This strategy may be employed to trick a quarterback who has not correctly interpreted the shift. The main drawback here is that the middle of the field is left open.\nAdvantages.\nThe advantage of cover 2 is that it provides great versatility to the defense as the corners can play run, short pass, and deep pass with the confidence that they have support from two deep safeties. \nDisadvantages.\nThe main weakness of the Cover 2 shell occurs in the middle of the field between the safeties. At the snap of the ball, many times the safeties will move toward the sidelines in order to cover any long passes to quick wide receivers. This movement creates a natural hole between the safeties that can be attacked. By sending a receiver (usually a tight end) into the hole (in the middle of the field), the offense forces the safety to make a decision: play the vulnerable hole or help out on the wide receiver. The quarterback reads the safety's decision and decides on the best matchup (i.e., which mismatch is better: tight end vs. safety or wide receiver vs. cornerback). This disadvantage is ameliorated somewhat in the Tampa 2 variation; however, in moving the middle linebacker into deep coverage, it opens up the \"underneath\" center zone in the 5-10 yard range.\nAnother disadvantage of Cover 2 is that it leaves only seven men in the \"box\" (the area near the ball at the snap) to defend against the run. In contrast Cover 1 and Cover 3 usually have eight men in the box.\nA potential problem with Cover 2 is that defensive pressure on the Quarterback must be provided nearly exclusively by the front linemen, as all other defenders are involved in pass coverage. If the defensive linemen do not provide adequate pressure on the quarterback, the offense is afforded plenty of time to create and exploit passing opportunities. Blitzing in Cover 2 often creates greater areas of weakness in the defense than other coverages. Thus, unsuccessful blitzes can prove to be more productive for the offense than in other schemes.\nTampa 2.\nTampa 2 refers to a style of defense played by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and implemented by its coaches, Tony Dungy, Lovie Smith, and Monte Kiffin, in recent years. Because of its success it has become popular with many professional and college teams. It blends the Cover 2 and Cover 3 defenses by having two defensive backs, usually the safeties, in deep coverage on either side of the field, and a middle linebacker covering the medium to deep middle. Its benefit over cover 2 is that the sidelines and middle of the field are better protected against deep threats, with the drawback being a larger open area in the short middle of the field underneath the middle linebacker. Its benefit over cover 3 is that it only dedicates two defensive backs to deep coverage rather than three, allowing for better protection against short outside routes. The Tampa 2 generally requires a quick and agile middle linebacker who is capable of staying with tight ends and wide receivers in pass coverage.\nCover 3.\nIn Cover 3, the two corners and free safety each have responsibility for a deep third of the field, while the strong safety plays like a linebacker. This coverage is generally considered to be a run stopping defense as it focuses on preventing big pass plays and stopping the run while giving up short passes.\nOn the snap, the CBs work for depth, backpedaling into their assigned zone. One safety moves toward the center of the field. The other safety is free to rotate into the flat area (about 2–4 yards beyond the line of scrimmage), provide pass coverage help, or blitz.\nAdvantages.\nOne of the biggest benefits of the Cover 3 coverage scheme is the ability to walk the strong safety up into the box with minimal to no changes in the coverage due to the pre-snap center field position of the free safety. This enables the defense to play strong against the run, but still prevent explosion plays such as a long pass or break away run. This advantage is most pronounced versus two tight end sets which naturally creates 8 holes for running backs, whereas in cover 2 schemes there are only 7 defenders in the box leaving 1 hole uncovered, or requiring a defender to cover 2 holes.\nDisadvantages.\nCover 3 schemes are susceptible to short, timed passes to the outside due to the hard drop of both cornerbacks. This puts pressure on the outside linebackers to react to pass plays and get into their drop quickly if they need to cover a receiver.\nAnother disadvantage of Cover 3 schemes is they are relatively easy to diagnose by opposing quarterbacks. Because of this, teams will often employ slight wrinkles in their coverage to confuse offenses. An example of this includes employing man coverage on one side and zone coverage on another, or swapping coverage zones between defenders. It also leaves the seams open and forces the safety to choose a man to cover on four verticals, leaving one open.\nCover 4.\nCover 4, or quarters, refers to 4 deep defenders each guarding one-fourth of the deep zone. Cover 4 schemes are almost always used to defend against deep passes. (See also Prevent defense).\nThe most basic Cover 4 scheme involves 3 CBs and 2 safeties. Upon snap, the CBs work for depth, backpedaling into their assigned zone. Both safeties backpedal towards their assigned zone.\nAs with other coverage shells, Cover 4 is paired with underneath man or zone coverage in its most basic form.\nAdvantages.\nThe main advantage of a Cover 4 defense is that it is extremely difficult for even the best quarterbacks to complete long passes against it. Therefore, this coverage is generally used as a prevent defense to be used near the end of a game or half, meaning that the defense sacrifices the run and short pass to avoid giving up the big play with the confidence that the clock will soon expire.\nCover 4 also has the advantage of using safeties in run support, as opposed to cornerbacks, as would be the case in a Cover 2 scheme. This gives the defense nine in the box and the ability to stop the run with an extra defender on either side. The play-side safety would come up in support on a running play while the back-side safety would be responsible for the middle third of the field, and the cornerbacks would have the deep outside thirds.\nDisadvantages.\nThe main weakness of Cover 4 shells is the large amount of space left open by the retreating defensive backs. Since the defensive backs are working for depth, short pass routes underneath can enable the quarterback to make short- and medium- length passes, as well as isolate a defensive back on a wide receiver near the sideline with little help.\nCover 6.\nCover 6 call defensive strength to the Field instead of to the offensive formation or front, and organize personnel by field-side player and boundary-side player. The position of the ball on the field therefore dictates the strength of the offense. In Cover 6 the field safety and field corner cover fourths of the field, and depend on a field outside linebacker to support them underneath. The free safety covers the boundary-side deep half, and the boundary corner plays the flat. Thus, the field side of the coverage is quarters, and the boundary side is cover 2.\nThe Cover 6 gets its name from the fact that it combines elements of the Cover 2 (the strong safety covering half the field) and the Cover 4 on the opposite side. \nOn the strong side, the corner and safety play \"Cover 4 rules\", which as above the corner and safety each have a quarter of the field working for depth in their zones. The \"Sam\" linebacker will be dropping outside to cover the flats. If in 3-4 the Middle Backer will cover that sides hook to curl if not blitzing.\nOn the weak side, the corner and safety play \"Cover 2 rules\", which as above the corner stays home in the flats, and the safety covers the deep half. The \"Will\" backer will play hook to curl or blitz depending on the call. If in 3-4 usually the \"Will\" or the Middle Backer will blitz from that side.\nThe Cover 6 is also good for calling a corner blitz from the weak side, and having the backer cover flats instead.\nAdvantages.\nCover 6 blends the best of Cover 2 and Cover 4. On the boundary, Cover 6 uses a Cover 2 corner. The boundary corner sits at 5–7 yards and is in excellent position to attack flat passes and wide runs, as well as blitz from a short field position. The boundary safety plays at 12–15 yards and supports the boundary corner, providing good pass defense over the top, as well as being able to assist on any vertical release by a 3rd receiver from the field side. The field safety plays a hard read technique from 7–8 yards, reading first for run. He will fit hard and fast on run plays. He defends the pass by squatting or dropping over the #2 wide receiver. He will then play vertical patterns and in patterns by #2 then #1, passing off inside patterns. The Field corner plays a quarters deep coverage from 7–8 yards, reading the #1 wide receiver and playing all vertical and outside patterns.\nDisadvantages.\nCover 6 has the disadvantages of both Cover 2 and Cover 4. The field side is generally soft on flat coverage. The field side corner can be left in single coverage deep as well. On runs, the field side may be spread by a tight end and 2 receiver formation, offering an advantage on the edge. The Boundary side is hard behind the corner to the sideline, as well as in the seam between corner and linebacker.\nReferences.\nNotes\nBibliography"

He played college football for the Syracuse Orangemen.\nEarly years.\nFlannery attended Pottsville High School, where he played defensive tackle and center. As a senior, he was named defensive MVP of Pennsylvania's Big 33 and won the state heavyweight wrestling championship.\nHe accepted a football scholarship from Syracuse University. As a redshirt freshman with the Orangemen, he became the starter at left guard for 10 games. As a sophomore, he was named the starting center, where he would remain the rest of his college career. He earned consensus All-American honors as a senior.\nIn 1999, he was named to the Syracuse University's All-Century team.\nProfessional career.\nHouston Oilers.\nFlannery was selected by the Houston Oilers in the second round (44th overall) of the 1991 NFL Draft. Because future hall of famer Bruce Matthews was the starting center at the time, he was moved to right guard where he started the first 9 games of the season until suffering a knee sprain and playing mainly on special teams after that. He was named to the NFL All-Rookie team.\nIn 1992, he appeared in 15 games and started 2 at left guard. He injured his left knee returning a short kickoff in the ninth game against the Cleveland Browns. He missed the next game and needed arthroscopic surgery on the knee during the off-season.\nIn 1993, he was lost for the season with a torn left anterior cruciate ligament he suffered in training camp on July 31. In 1994, he was the regular starter at left guard, making it the first time in his career he started all 16 games.\nIn 1995, he had surgery during training camp to repair the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, which he originally injured in 1993. He was waived injured on August 8.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nOn August 10, 1995, he signed a contract with the Green Bay Packers, but it was invalidated after he failed a physical because of his previous knee injury.\nDallas Cowboys.\nOn October 3, 1996, he was signed 4 weeks into the season as a free agent by the Dallas Cowboys. He spent the season rehabbing his left knee, which was surgically repaired the previous year. He was declared inactive for 10 games, until seeing his first action in the fourth quarter of the season finale against the Washington Redskins.\nIn 1997, he competed with Clay Shiver for the starting center position that was left open with the release of Ray Donaldson, but he ended up as the backup and started 4 games at left guard.\nSt. Louis Rams.\nOn April 1, 1998, he was signed as a free agent by the St. Louis Rams and was named the starter at center. The next year, he was placed on the injured reserve list, in a season the team went on to win Super Bowl XXXIV. He wasn't re-signed after the season."

The St. Pats defeated Vancouver three games to two in the best-of-five game series to win their only Stanley Cup as the St. Pats.\nThis was the last Stanley Cup Finals contested by a team from Vancouver until the 1982 Stanley Cup Finals. All games were held at Arena Gardens in Toronto.\nPaths to the Finals.\nVancouver finished second overall in the 1921–22 PCHA regular season standings with a 12–12 record. However, they then went on to defeat the 12–11–1 first place Seattle Metropolitans in the PCHA championship series, winning both games by 1–0.\nMeanwhile, the 1921–22 NHL season was capped with the 13–10–1 second place St. Patricks defeating the 14–8–2 first place Ottawa Senators, 5–4, in the two-game total goals NHL championship series.\nAfter defeating the WCHL's Regina Capitals in the preliminary series, the PCHA's Vancouver Millionaires travelled to Toronto for the Final.\nGame summaries.\nA fifth and deciding game five was necessary in this series to determine who would win the Cup. After Vancouver won game one, 4–3, Babe Dye scored 4:50 into overtime of game two to give Toronto a 2–1 win.It was in this game that Toronto fans got to see the penalty shot for the first time as Vancouver defenceman Art Duncan tripped Babe Dye from behind. Dye did not score on the shot. Vancouver won game three 3-0 and defenceman Harry Cameron suffered a separated shoulder and Toronto asked Frank Patrick for the use of Ottawa defenceman Eddie Gerard and Patrick permitted it. The St. Patricks tied the series in game four, 6–0, as John Ross Roach became the first rookie goaltender to record a Stanley Cup shutout. After this game, Patrick ruled Gerard ineligible. A sellout crowd jammed the Arena Gardens for game five. The game belonged to Toronto as Dye scored four goals in a 5–1 victory to clinch the Cup. Harry Cameron played despite his injury and mixed it up with Alf Skinner of Vancouver for which both players were banished with minor penalties for roughing. Reg Noble played a very good defensive game for Toronto.\nFor the series, Dye scored nine of the St. Pats' 16 goals, while Roach posted a 1.80 goals-against average.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1922 Stanley Cup was presented by the trophy's trustee William Foran.

        "text": "These are the official results of the men's 10,000 metres event at the 1983 IAAF World Championships in Helsinki, Finland. There were a total number of 37 participating athletes, with two qualifying heats held on Sunday 7 August and the final held on Tuesday 9 August 1983.\nRecords.\nExisting records at the start of the event.\nSummary.\nWith the best in the world filtered down to 18 finalists, there was still a traffic jam on the track. In the first 80 metres several athletes were jostled trying to find running room. Christoph Herle and Antonio Prieto found themselves lying on the track. Out of the chaos, Bekele Debele was far back in the string of competitors, speeding down the outside of the backstretch. This culminated with him taking over the lead for a short period of time before Gidamis Shahanga took over the point. Joined by Mohamed Kedir, the three Africans jockeyed for the lead marked most closely by Carlos Lopes. The African pace was not consistent, instead slowing until the field bunched then speeding up to disrupt the even pace most distance runners would prefer. With 6 laps to go, tall, long striding, home favorite Martti Vainio took charge with a 63 second lap, exciting the crowd and forcing the field the change their pace to catch back up. For three laps, Vainio held the lead but was looking for help that was not going to support him. With three laps to go, the pack was bunched tighter than ever, 13 athletes all within 10 metres. Again Kedir took the lead with Lopes almost attached to his shoulder. 50 metres before the bell, the pack was finally disrupted by Werner Schildhauer sprinting out to a 3 metre lead. His East German teammate Hansjörg Kunze and Vaino rushed to cover the break. Shahanga and Alberto Cova were the last to hang on to the breakaway down the final backstretch. With 200 to go, Schildhauer had 3 metres on Kunze who had another 3 metres on Vainio, with Shahanga and Cova respectively another 2 and 4 metres back. Through the final turn, all those distances began to compress. By the time they hit the final straightaway, they were in the same order but with a metre separating each. Each then pulled progressively wider, Cova all the way out to lane 4, so each could have running room for the sprint to the finish. Cova was clearly the faster sprinter, cruising past the field. Schildhauer and Kunze both leaned for the finish way too early, hoping the finish line would arrive sooner. The first four runners separated by a third of a second after 10,000 metres. The result was not exactly a surprise, it was the same result as the European Championships for Cova, Schildhauer, Vainio and 6th place Lopes, a year earlier, with the addition of Kunze and Shahanga. Minus the boycotting East Germans, Cova pulled the same stunt on Vainio in what turned into a match race at the 1984 Olympics. Days later, Vainio was later disqualified for doping.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe qualifying heats took place on 7 August, with the 37 athletes involved being split into 2 heats. The first 5 athletes in each heat ( Q ) and the next 8 fastest ( q ) qualified for the final. \nFinal.\nThe final took place on August 9."

Smith picked up his nickname when he played on the same line as Ray Powell for the Omaha Knights following World War II. His brother Dalton \"Nakina\" Smith, played with him on many occasions throughout his career.\nProfessional career.\nMinor league hockey.\nSmith was small in size, but more than made up for it with his stellar play on the ice. After spending time with the St. Michael's Majors in the junior league of the Ontario Hockey Association he began play for the Oshawa G-Men of the senior league in the 1935–36 season. He continued to excel on the ice and was finally noticed after a stellar season in which he scored 30 points in just 18 games. Smith was contacted by the Detroit Red Wings on his birthday and signed as a free agent just nine days later. He was to begin play for the Wings in their farm system, starting with the Detroit Holzbaugh Ford of the Michigan-Ontario Hockey Association in the 1939–40 season. Smith averaged more than a point per game pace for the first 31 games of the season. Smith started the next season in the American Hockey Association with the first place St. Louis Flyers and playing for the first time with his brother, Dalton. Smith and his brother helped keep the Flyers in first place for the next two years, including helping them win the Harry F. Sinclair Trophy, given to the league champions, in 1940–41. For the 1942–43 season, Smith finally made the jump to the American Hockey League along with Dalton to begin play for the New Haven Eagles, but end the season playing for the Buffalo Bisons, all while scoring 38 points. He also helped lead the Bisons to win the AHL championship and the Calder Cup with his 9 playoff points.\nPlaying in the NHL.\nFinally in 1943, while having begun play for the Indianapolis Capitols (again reuniting with his brother), the Smith brothers were called up to play for the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League. Carl contributed a goal and an assist in seven games, but still found himself back down in the minors. He finished out the season with the Capitols and ended up with another point per game season. In 1944–45, Smith again joined the St. Louis Flyers and ended with 10 goals and 26 assists.\nFor the 1945–46 season, Smith made the jump to the United States Hockey League (USHL), after a short stint with the Capitols again, and joined play for the Omaha Knights. He was an instant success scoring 29 goals and 67 points in 54 games to lead the team in scoring. He was named to the USHL First All-Star Team. He also scored in three goals in the Knights playoff run, losing to the Kansas City Pla-mors. The following season the Knights acquired Nelson Boyce who would befriend Smith and form a strong scoring duo that would stay together for the next two years. They spent so much time together, the pair became known as Blinky and Winky to teammates and fans. After two more successful seasons with the Knights, and two more postseason losses to the Pla-mors, Smith decided to retire from playing ice hockey at the end of the 1948–49 season."

        "title": "1928 Stanley Cup Finals",
        "text": "The 1928 Stanley Cup Finals was a best-of-five series played entirely in Montreal between the New York Rangers and the Montreal Maroons. It was the first appearance by the Rangers in the Finals in only their second season. The Maroons made their second Finals appearance after winning the Stanley Cup in . The Rangers won the series three games to two to earn their first championship in franchise history; this was also the second Stanley Cup victory by an American-based team, and the first since the Seattle Metropolitans in . This was also the first of only two times that a Montreal-based team lost the clinching game of the Stanley Cup Finals at home in the Montreal Forum, the other occurred in when the Calgary Flames defeated the Montreal Canadiens. This was the last Stanley Cup Finals to be played in one location until the pandemic shortened season of .\nPaths to the Finals.\nThe Montreal Maroons defeated the Ottawa Senators in the quarter-finals total-goals series 3–1. The Maroons then defeated the Montreal Canadiens in the semi-finals total-goals series 3–2 to reach the Finals.\nThe New York Rangers defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in the quarter-finals total-goals series 6–4. The Rangers then defeated the Boston Bruins in the semi-finals total-goals series 5–2 to reach the Finals.\nGame summaries.\nThe series had to be played in Montreal, as the circus had taken over New York's Madison Square Garden.\nThe Rangers lost their goalie Lorne Chabot to an eye injury in the second period of game two. Although goaltenders Alex Connell and Hugh McCormick were in the stands, the Maroons refused to allow the Rangers to use either goalie. In one of the most famous incidents in hockey history, 44-year-old coach Lester Patrick took over with the recorded words \"Boys, don't let an old man down,\" and his efforts inspired the Rangers to a 2–1 victory in overtime. At 44 years, 99 days old, Patrick became the oldest man to play in the Stanley Cup Finals, a record which remains unsurpassed to this day (Chris Chelios in 2008 at the age of 46 became the oldest player with his name on the cup, though he did not log any ice time in the final). He entered with eight minutes remaining in the second period and played the final 35:05 of the game.\nFor the following matches, the Rangers hired New York Americans goalie Joe Miller, who won two games including a shutout. Miller was available to all NHL teams as a backup after the Americans had put him on waivers. The Boston Bruins had claimed him on waivers, but he was made available to any NHL team. At the time of the Finals, Miller had not played in four weeks, and was home in Ottawa. Miller was cut and suffered two black eyes in game five, but hung on for a 2–1 victory.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1928 Stanley Cup was presented to Rangers captain Bill Cook by NHL President Frank Calder following the Rangers 2–1 win over the Maroons in game five.\nThe following Rangers players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\nFrank Boucher became the fourth member of his family to win the Stanley Cup, after his brother George won it four times with Ottawa, and his brothers Billy and Bobby had won it with Montreal in 1924.\n1927–28 New York Rangers\nThree champions.\nWith the Rangers' triumph, the city of New York became home of the titlists of all three major sports leagues, including the 1927 World Series-winning New York Yankees and the 1927 National Football League champion New York Giants (the Yankees won again in 1928, giving New York bragging rights over MLB, the NFL and NHL for almost 14 months, until the Providence Steamrollers clinched the NFL title in December of that year). The only other city to pull off this feat is Detroit, whose Tigers, Lions and Red Wings reigned over the pro sports scene in 1935."

        "text": "The 1996 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 1995–96 season, and the culmination of the 1996 Stanley Cup playoffs. It was contested by the Western Conference champion Colorado Avalanche and the Eastern Conference champion Florida Panthers, two teams in the Finals for the first time. Colorado defeated Florida in a four-game sweep to win their first Stanley Cup becoming the seventh post-1967 expansion team and the second former WHA team (after the Edmonton Oilers) to win the Cup. Colorado's Joe Sakic earned the Conn Smythe Trophy as MVP of the 1996 Playoffs.\nIt was Colorado's first appearance in the Finals, in only their first season in Denver since moving from Quebec City (where they had formerly played as the Nordiques) in 1995. It was also Florida's first appearance in the Finals, in only the franchise's third season since entering the NHL in 1993 and they would not appear again until , after they swept the Carolina Hurricanes in four games in the Eastern Conference final. Only four other teams have made their first Stanley Cup Finals appearance faster: the Toronto Arenas winning the Stanley Cup in the NHL inaugural season in , the St. Louis Blues in their debut season in (they lost the Finals to the Montreal Canadiens), the Vegas Golden Knights in their inaugural year in , and the Cup-winning New York Rangers (who were in their second season of play, having been formed for the season). This was also the first time since the formation of the NHL in 1917 that the two teams competing for the Cup were making their first Finals appearance. The Panthers are currently the second Stanley Cup finalist team after the 1982 Vancouver Canucks without any Hall of Famers on their roster.\nThis was the first championship ever won by a team based in Denver: the Avalanche would go on to win two more Stanley Cups ( and ), while the Denver Broncos won Super Bowls XXXII, XXXIII and 50, and the Denver Nuggets won the 2023 NBA Finals (which was also the next time Denver and Miami contested a championship).\nPaths to the Finals.\nColorado defeated the Vancouver Canucks, Chicago Blackhawks, and Detroit Red Wings in six games each to advance to the Finals.\nFlorida defeated the Boston Bruins in five games, the Philadelphia Flyers in six, and the Pittsburgh Penguins in seven.\nGame summaries.\nGame one.\nThe series opened on June 4, at the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver. Patrick Roy was in goal for Colorado, and John Vanbiesbrouck was between the pipes for Florida (a rematch from the 1986 Wales Conference Finals when Roy was with the Montreal Canadiens and Vanbiesbrouck was with the New York Rangers). Although Colorado was the heavy favorite in the series, Florida got on the board first on Tom Fitzgerald's goal at 16:51 of the first period. That would be all the Panthers would get, however, as Colorado scored three times within five minutes in the second period. Scott Young scored at 10:32, Mike Ricci scored at 12:21, and Uwe Krupp scored at 14:21. The Avalanche went on to win the game 3–1, with Roy making 25 saves in the victory.\nGame two.\nPeter Forsberg got the Avalanche on the board first in game two, scoring an unassisted goal at 4:11 of the first period. The Panthers tied the game on Stu Barnes' power-play goal at 7:52. Rene Corbet broke the 1–1 tie with a power-play goal at 10:43, and then Forsberg scored two power-play goals of his own at 13:46 and 15:05 to complete the hat trick. Colorado led 4–1 after just one period. The Avalanche would make it 5–1 with Corbet's second goal of the game at 4:37 of the second period. Valeri Kamensky followed with a goal just 31 seconds later, and Jon Klemm scored at 10:03 to give Colorado a dominating 7–1 lead after two periods. Klemm would add another goal at 17:28 of the third period. It was the Avalanche's fourth power-play goal of the game. Colorado won the game 8–1, with three players scoring at least twice.\nGame three.\nThe Avalanche went to the Miami Arena in Florida with a 2–0 series lead. Claude Lemieux, back after his two-game suspension, scored the first goal of the game at 2:44 of the first period to give Colorado a 1–0 lead. Florida played determinedly, however, and tied the game on Ray Sheppard's power-play goal at 9:14. Rob Niedermayer scored at 11:19 to give the Panthers their second lead of the series. The score was 2–1 Florida after one period. At 1:38 of the second period, Colorado's Mike Keane scored a game-tying goal. Captain Joe Sakic scored the go-ahead goal just 82 seconds later, and Colorado went on to win 3–2 and take a commanding three-games-to-none lead in the series. Patrick Roy made 32 saves in the win.\nGame four.\nWith their backs to the wall, the Panthers played a defensive game. Florida goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck went save for save with Colorado goaltender Patrick Roy. The two teams played a marathon game that took until the third overtime period. Uwe Krupp's unassisted goal at 4:31 ended 44 minutes and 31 seconds of overtime and gave the Avalanche a 1–0 win and a four-game series sweep. Goaltender Patrick Roy stopped all 63 shots he faced. Colorado outscored Florida 15–4 in the series, and Patrick Roy stopped 147 of 151 shots, for a save percentage of .974. Joe Sakic was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP, having led all skaters in goals with 18, and points with 34. For both Patrick Roy and Claude Lemieux, it was one of their three Stanley Cup wins in 11 years. Roy and Lemieux first won the Cup in 1986 with the Montreal Canadiens. Roy won a second Cup with Montreal in 1993. Lemieux won a second cup with New Jersey in 1995.\nThe Avalanche became the third team to win the cup after relocating: the Calgary Flames won the Cup after moving from Atlanta and the New Jersey Devils in 1995 won the Cup 13 years after they played their last game in the same city and same arena that the Avs played in as the Colorado Rockies.\nTeam rosters.\nBolded years under Finals appearance indicates year won Stanley Cup.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1996 Stanley Cup was presented to Avalanche captain Joe Sakic by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman following the Avalanche's 1–0 triple overtime win over the Panthers in game four.\nThe following Avalanche players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1995–96 Colorado Avalanche\nNote:\nStanley Cup engravings.\nAdam Deadmarsh's name was misspelled ADAM DEADMARCH. This mistake was corrected by stamping an \"S\" over the \"C\" twice. Deadmarsh's name was the first player's name to be corrected on the Presentation Stanley Cup.\nBroadcasting.\nIn Canada, the series was televised on CBC. In the United States, this was the second year that coverage was split between Fox and ESPN. Fox broadcast games 1 and 3 while ESPN televised games 2 and 4. The Stanley Cup-clinching game thus aired on cable. Had the series extended, Fox would have televised games 5 and 7, and ESPN would have aired game 6."

        "title": "Women's Australian Open",
        "text": "The Women's Australian Open is a women's professional golf tournament played in Australia, operated by Golf Australia and the WPGA Tour of Australasia, long co-sanctioned by the Ladies European Tour (LET). Beginning with the 2012 event, it is also co-sanctioned by the U.S.-based LPGA Tour. In 2008, it was the second-richest women's golf tournament on the ALPG Tour, with a prize fund of A$500,000, and was raised to A$600,000 in 2010. With the co-sanctioning by the LPGA, the total purse was nearly doubled, and was also fixed in U.S. dollars. The purse was US$1.1 million in 2012, and increased again to its current level of US$1.2 million for 2013. Since 2011, the tournament's name has been the ISPS Handa Women's Australian Open.\nThe Australian Ladies Open was founded in 1974 as a 54-hole event, but folded after 1978. It was resurrected in 1994 as the Women's Australian Open, this time as a 72-hole event. Annika Sörenstam won that year, which was her first professional win. It was also Karrie Webb's professional debut, and she would later win the event five times. Starting in 2000, the Ladies European Tour began co-sanctioning the tournament. Following the 2004 event, sponsorship difficulties caused the tournament to stop once again, but after a two-year hiatus the tournament returned in 2007. The Women's Australian Open usually moves between various courses around Australia, except from 1995 through 2002 when it was held at the Yarra Yarra Golf Club in Melbourne. The 2008 event was held at Kingston Heath Golf Club.\nFor several years after its return in 1994, the Women's Australian Open was played early in the ALPG schedule, usually in November. Starting in 2000, it was changed to be played at the end of the schedule in February near the ANZ Ladies Masters, to allow both tournaments to be part of the Ladies European Tour. Since the Women's Australian Open was played from 12 to 15 November 1998 during the 1998/1999 ALPG season, it was therefore not played during the 1999 calendar year.\nThe 2012 tournament was played at the Composite Course at Royal Melbourne, the championship course comprising 12 holes from the West course and six from the East course. The Composite Course is considered one of the top courses in the world, and was used for the Presidents Cup competitions in 1998 and 2011. Through 2011, a women's professional competition had never been held on it; the 2012 Women's Australian Open was the first. The event was won by Jessica Korda after an historic six-player playoff, only the second in ALPG history. Korda holed a birdie putt on the second playoff hole to claim her first LPGA Tour victory.\nIn 2013, the tournament moved to Royal Canberra Golf Club, and in 2014 to the Victoria Golf Club near Melbourne. In 2016 the event moved to Adelaide and was played there until 2020. In 2021, it was not played due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2022, the tournament was played at Victoria Golf Club and Kingston Heath Golf Club. In a world-first for golf, the ISPS Handa Australian Open brought together the national men's and women's Open events, along with the All Abilities Championship. The men's Open and the women's Open had equal prize money of as the Open returned to Melbourne for the first time in several years. In 2022, the event fell during the LPGA's off-season and during the tour's final stage of qualifying school and therefore co-sanctioning the event with the LPGA was not possible.\n2020 course layout.\nRoyal Adelaide Golf Club\nWinners.\n1Tournament shortened to 36 holes due to rain\nPOWon after playoff"

        "text": "The following is a list of the American television networks and announcers who have broadcast NASCAR's annual Daytona 500 throughout the years. Throughout its history, the Daytona 500 has been aired on all four major networks in the U.S., including ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox. In 1979, CBS covered the race live flag-to-flag for the first time. The unprecedented broadcast was considered risky by network executives, but was a rousing success when a snowstorm blanketed much of the east coast, prompting a huge viewing audience. An exciting and shocking finish capped off a telecast that was considered a ground-breaking moment in the history of NASCAR, and one of the defining moments that helped elevate the sport into the mainstream.\nCurrently, Fox holds exclusive rights to carry the Daytona 500 in the United States, under the terms of contract extensions that run through the 2024 NASCAR season. As part of the package, Fox also holds the exclusive rights to support events held during Daytona 500 Speedweeks, including the Clash, Daytona 500 pole qualifying, the Duels, the Truck Series race, the Xfinity Series race, and the respective practice sessions. Some of the ancillary events are aired on Fox companion channels FS1 and FS2.\nEarly CBS and ABC's \"Wide World of Sports\" era (1959–1978).\nThe first known telecast of a NASCAR race was the 1960 Daytona 500, parts of which was presented as part of \"CBS Sports Spectacular\", with announcer Bud Palmer.\nFrom 1962 to 1978, the Daytona 500 was shown on ABC's \"Wide World of Sports\". During the 1960s and early 1970s, the race was filmed and an edited highlight package aired the following weekend. In 1974, ABC began the first semi-live coverage (joined-in-progress) of the Daytona 500. Coverage was normally timed to begin when the race was halfway over. Brief taped highlights of the start and early segments were shown, then ABC joined the race live already in progress, picking up approximately the last 90 minutes of the race. This format continued through 1978.\nThe 1976 race was held on the same day of the final day of competition in the Winter Olympics (also broadcast on ABC). ABC carried 30 minutes of live coverage of the start of the race, then switched to the Olympics for 90 minutes to carry taped coverage of the final two competitive events (a cross-country ski race and the final runs in the bobsled), held earlier that day. Then it was back to Daytona for about an hour-and-a-half for the finish.\nDuring the period on \"Wide World of Sports\", the booth announcers typically served as roving pit reporters during the running of the race, as well as interviewing in victory lane. The booth commentary was recorded in post-production.\nCBS era (1979–2000).\nIn 1979, CBS instituted the live \"flag-to-flag\" coverage policy. The ground-breaking 1979 broadcast ushered in the 22-year run of \"NASCAR on CBS\". The 1987 broadcast won the Sports Emmy for \"Outstanding Live Sports Special.\" Ken Squier served as play-by-play announcer from 1979 to 1997. In 1998, former pit reporter Mike Joy was promoted to play-by-play, while Squier moved to the host position.\nThe 1995 race includes a two-hour rain delay that occurred near the midpoint. Some markets in the U.S. did not have the race, as CBS lost major market affiliates during the 1994-95 season.\nDuring its entire run from 1979-2000, CBS also carried the Busch Clash (live), and in most years, carried the Twin 125s (tape-delayed). In the mid-1990s, CBS also picked up coverage of the Goody's 300, while pole qualifying for the Daytona 500 was aired on ESPN during much of the 1990s.\nSince 1996, U.S. television ratings for the Daytona 500 have been the highest for any auto race of the year, surpassing the traditional leader, the Indianapolis 500. The 2006 Daytona 500 attracted the sixth largest average live global TV audience of any sporting event that year with 20 million viewers.\nFox/NBC era (2001–2006).\nFrom 2001 to 2006, the Daytona 500 broadcasting network alternated between Fox and NBC under the terms of a six-year, $2.48 billion, centralized NASCAR television contract. Previously, television rights deals for races were negotiated by the individual track owners. Beginning in 2001, the television contract would now be administered by the sanctioning body. Fox carried the Daytona 500 in odd-numbered years (2001, 2003, 2005), and NBC carried the Daytona 500 in even-numbered years (2002, 2004, 2006). The Pepsi 400 in July followed the opposite pattern, going to the network not airing the Daytona 500 in the respective season.\nRights to other support events held during Speedweeks followed the same general pattern, alternating between Fox/FX (odd years) and NBC/TNT (even years). Ancillary events included the Budweiser Shootout, Daytona 500 pole qualifying, the Gatorade 125s, as well as coverage of \"Happy Hour\" practice and other practice sessions. The Busch Series race followed the same pattern, however, the Truck Series race was aired by ESPN for two seasons as part of a different contract, before it switched to Speed Channel, who also aired the Goody's Dash Series race in 2002-2004, taking over from FX in 2001 (although in 2004 the Dash Series was no longer sanctioned by NASCAR).\nIn 2001, after CBS lost the rights to the Daytona 500, Ken Squier left the network and joined Fox for a one-race arrangement as special contributor and studio host.\nExclusive Fox era (2007–present).\nStarting in 2007, Fox became the exclusive home of the Daytona 500 under the terms of NASCAR's new television package. Contract extensions signed in 2011 and 2012 extended the exclusive rights on Fox through the 2024 season."

        "title": "Phil King (American football)",
        "text": "Philip Edgar King (June 22, 1936 – January 18, 1973) was an American football running back in the National Football League (NFL) for the New York Giants, Pittsburgh Steelers, and the Minnesota Vikings. He played college football at Vanderbilt University (1955–57) and was drafted in the first round (twelfth overall) of the 1958 NFL Draft. He was nicknamed \"the Chief\" due to his Native American heritage.\nCollege.\nPhil King was a starting running back at Vanderbilt. He was one of the top SEC conference backs and played in five NFL championship games in six seasons with the New York Giants. He was (All-State), basketball and baseball at Dyersburg (TN) High School.\nAt Vanderbilt King played for Coach Art Guepe, missed his entire freshman season due to a back injury, in 1955 his sophomores year he gained 628 rushing yards (6.4 yards per carry). He was named Third Team All-SEC and All-South by International News Service.\nIn the 1955 season the Commodores played in the Gator Bowl (27-13 win over Auburn), Vanderbilt football's first-ever postseason game. King scored a touchdown but a penalty on the play wiped it out. King also played defensive back. A Vanderbilt press release wrote about King, \"In the broken field King flashes his quick, elusive speed of the deer, but at the line of scrimmage he uses the crunching power of the buffalo. On defense he cuts down a runner with the sudden slash of a bear, or leaps to snare a pass out of the air with the keenness of the eagle.\"\nKnown to his teammates as \"Chief\" because of his Cherokee Indian ancestry, King was described as an \"unusually versatile runner with both power and speed; he is a rugged tackler and a dangerous threat on pass defense; he is a capable passer and a great receiver; he is a powerful punter, a tremendous kick-off man, and a cool kicker on vital extra points.\"\nIn King's junior year, he was voted All-SEC (First Team) honors he led the Commodores in rushing (651 yards), with punt returns (247 yards), kickoff returns (137 yards) and scoring (47 points). King was 5-of-7 on PAT's while scoring seven touchdowns. A Vanderbilt press release dated November 15, 1956 reported on King's toughness and determination during the 1956 season: \"King was invited to play in the Blue-Gray Classic and the Senior Bowl and named an Academic All-American. Playing in an era of dominating defenses, conservative offenses and fewer games, King's 1,717 career-rushing yards would rank him as one of the top Commodores' running backs in history.\"\nNFL.\nKing was selected in the first round of the 1958 NFL Draft with the No. 12 pick overall by The New York Giants. In the 1958 season, King was selected as the NFL Rookie of the Year while rushing for 316 yards (83 attempts), 134 yards receiving (11 receptions) and one rushing touchdown. King was a back-up to Frank Gifford. While with the Giants the team made it to the NFL Championship game with the Baltimore Colts. Considered \"The Greatest Game Played\" the Colts defeated the Giants 23-17 in sudden death overtime. He also played in the NFL Championship games with the Giants in 1959 (Colts 31 Giants 16), 1961 (Packers 37 Giants 0), 1962 (Packers 16 Giants 7) and 1963 (Bears 14 Giants 10). In the 1963 NFL championship game, King played against former Vanderbilt quarterback Bill Wade who scored the Bears only two touchdowns in the Chicago victory. King finished his NFL career with Pittsburgh (1964) and Minnesota (1965–66). His NFL career totals include 103 games, 2,192 yards (569 carries, 3.9 avg.), 16 touchdowns (seven rushing) with his longest run from scrimmage 50 yards. King was inducted into the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame in 1976.\nDeath.\nJanuary 20, 1973, Page 22 \"The New York Times\" wrote:\n\"Phil King, a running back for the New York Giants during their glory years from 1958 through 1963 when the team won five Eastern Division titles in the National Football League, died in Memphis Thursday (January 18, 1973) of what was reported as an accidental gunshot wound in the head. The police said the 36‐year‐old King, a salesman from Nashville, died when a .38‐caliber pistol discharged while he was handling it. He was rushed to a hospital after being found in a Memphis motel room. He had been shot above the right ear.\nKing worked for a company in New Jersey, but living in Nashville at the time of his death. King is buried at Woodlawn Memorial Park and Mausoleum in Nashville Tennessee.\n\"The Tennessean\" sports writer John Bibb wrote at the time of King's death:\n\"I'll leave the stories of Phil King's football accomplishments to the record books and the newspaper files. They are in abundance, detailing a career of successes from high school and college right on through the professional game.\n\"There is another Phil King story you should know. It has nothing to do with the crowded stadiums in which he played. It has nothing to do with the delightful easy-going way he had of making a friend laugh, even at an old story.\n\"It has nothing to do with the way he put his words together to mesmerize an audience when he explained the virtues of college athletics, 'and what my scholarship meant to me.' It has to do instead with a guy who was never too busy to overlook a chance to help somebody.\n\"Yesterday Jess Neely [Vandy AD at the time and former Rice head football coach], one of King's favorites and a man who had tried to recruit Phil for Rice University back in 1953 was talking about the tragedy in Memphis. 'You know, I can't help but to remember Phil and the recent Sunday where we were getting all that snow,' said Coach Neely. 'Dorothy (Mrs. Neely) had put some food out for the birds in our back yard. She glanced out the window and noticed a big dog coming through the yard.\n\"'She was sure the dog was going to get the bird food, so she asked me to chase him away. I went outside, and there was Phil and a couple of youngsters. They had climbed the hill to our home.\n\"'Coach,' he said, 'I know it's going to be tough for you and Mrs. Neely to get out of here if the snow keeps falling. We're walking to the store and stopped to see if you needed anything we might bring back.'\"\n\"For Phil King there was no hill too steep, no block too difficult if it meant helping a friend. Few Vanderbilt athletes have been respected, admired and loved than Phil King. His teammates are coming from all corners of the country to be in Nashville on this sad day. One of them is Joe Stephenson, a senior end on the Gator Bowl team with King.\n\"'Looking back, Phil, although just a sophomore, was really one of us from the start,' said Stephenson. 'He didn't gain as much yardage his junior year as he did as a sophomore. All of the Gator Bowl line, except Art Demmas had graduated.\n\"'When we would ask him how things were going the next year (1956), Phil would laugh and say, 'the holes are a little smaller than usual, but The Chief can get through.'\""

        "title": "Historic Formula One Championship",
        "text": "The Historic Formula One Championship, previously known as the Thoroughbred Grand Prix Championship, was a championship for Formula One cars built during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. This championship was sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the motor sport's world governing body. The championship was recognised by the FIA in 1994 as the only official FIA Historic Formula One Championship and its first season was in 1995. In 2013, the series was absorbed by Masters Racing to create the FIA Masters Historic Formula One Championship.\nRegulations.\nClass system.\nThe championship was split into four classes according to the vehicle's age and technical specification.\nThe HFO Competition featured classic Grand Prix racing cars from the 20-year period between 1966 and 1985. During that period, there were design innovations and regulatory changes that resulted in significant performance differences and a vast speed differential between the earlier cars such as the Tyrrell 001, and the later machines such as the Tyrrell 012 and Brabham BT49.\nDrivers score points within their particular car's class and all have the chance to claim the overall FIA trophy at the end of the season.\nPoints.\nEffectively, there are four competitions going on within every race and each provides points for the driver based on his or her placing in the car's class and the number of competing cars in that class.\nAn additional point will be awarded to the drivers who achieve the fastest lap in each class during the race.\nChampionship awards.\nThe Champion is the driver who scores the greatest points total, regardless of the class in which he or she competes, and a driver can switch classes during the season. In addition to the overall champion, awards also go to drivers with the highest total of points in each class excluding the overall champion, as follows:\nHistoric Formula One Historic Cup – The competitor scoring the highest number of points in Class A.\nHistoric Formula One Classic Cup – The competitor scoring the highest number of points in Class B.\nHistoric Formula One Cup – The competitor scoring the highest number of points in Class C.\nHistoric Formula One Sporting Cup – The competitor scoring the highest number of points in Class D.\nThese are all FIA awards that are presented at an official FIA Historic Awards event.\nAdditional awards.\nHFO also presents its own awards at a slightly less formal and usually much more boisterous event as follows:\nThe Chairman's Trophy – Introduced in 2009 by Tony Smith, this is awarded to the competitor who, in the chairman's opinion, best exhibits the \"Spirit of the Championship\".\nThe Geoff Richardson Trophy – Provided by an engine builder, the trophy is awarded to the best newcomer.\nThe Nicholson McLaren Trophy – Provided by another engine builder. This 'trophy' is awarded to the 'best' team.\nThe Ensign Trophy – Provided by the former CEO of HFO, Mike Wheatley, who is something of an Ensign fan, having 'raced' an example in HFO very successfully. Although never a winner, the marque was at its peak during the Class B period and this trophy goes to the winner of Class B.\nThe Colin Chapman Trophy – provided by Clive Chapman and Classic Team Lotus. It is hard to imagine any historic category without a Colin Chapman Trophy but, as in HFO's case, it is equally hard to determine which period it might be applied to since Chapman was responsible for so many 'innovations'.\nAfter considering that Class C covers the period when ground effects, carbon fibre chassis and the controversial twin chassis Lotus Type 88 all emerged from Chapman's expertise, it was agreed that this trophy would go to the winner of Class C."

        "text": "The Georgia men's national basketball team () represents the country of Georgia in international basketball matches, and is controlled by the Georgian Basketball Federation. Georgia became a member of FIBA in 1992, after they gained independence from the Soviet Union. The national team played their first official match against Poland in 1995.\nGeorgia's accomplishments on the international level have been clinching qualification to the European Basketball Championship five times. Their best result came at their debut trip to the tournament in 2011. In 2023, Georgia achieved their first qualification on to the global stage at the FIBA World Cup.\nHistory.\nSoviet era.\nUntil 1991, Georgia was a part of the Soviet Union, with players born in Georgia playing for the Soviet Union national team. Notable players born in Georgia who played for the Soviet Union and won medals at the Olympic Games, FIBA World Cup and EuroBasket include: Nodar Dzhordzhikiya, Otar Korkia, Guram Minashvili, Vladimer Ugrekhelidze, Levan Moseshvili, Zurab Sakandelidze, Mikheil Korkia and Nikolay Deryugin.\nIndependent Georgia.\nAfter gaining independence from the Soviet Union, on several occasions the Georgian national team unsuccessfully tried to qualify for the EuroBasket, Europe's biggest basketball competition and major tournament. Although the national team did play on the EuroBasket Division B level three times and gained promotion in 2009 after defeating Belarus in play-offs. However, after the expansion of the EuroBasket in 2011 from 16 to 24 teams, Georgia qualified to the competition for the first time.\nEuroBasket 2011.\nThe national team played five matches in Group D. They finished their preliminary group with an 2–3 record, with wins against Belgium and Ukraine, to advance. In their second round group phase, Georgia lost all five of their matches to finish their maiden voyage to the EuroBasket in 11th place.\nEuroBasket 2013.\nAfter finishing second in qualifying group, Georgia qualified for its second EuroBasket tournament. After a comfortable 84–67 victory in the opening match over Poland, Georgia lost their four remaining matches and finished the tournament with an 1–4 record. To that point, the Eurobasket 2013 was the only tournament in which Georgia could not win more than one match.\nEuroBasket 2015.\nGeorgia qualified to the EuroBasket for the third successive time in 2015. After three consecutive losses to start the tournament, the national team finally earned their first win in group play against Macedonia 90–75. They followed it up with another victory to end the opening phase of the event against Croatia, 71–58 to move on to the knockout stages for the first time. There they suffered a narrow hard fought defeat to the tournament favourites, and eventual silver medalist Lithuania 81–85.\nEuroBasket 2017.\nDuring the EuroBasket 2017 qualification Georgia topped its group after an 90–84 victory over Montenegro, and qualified to EuroBasket for the fourth successive time. Once the competition began, the national team got off to a quick start, avenging their EuroBasket 2015 knockout stage defeat to Lithuania 79–77. The rest of the group stage didn't go as well for the Georgian side though. As the team could only manage to pullout one more victory against Israel, before falling to Italy to finish the tournament with an 2–3 record and being eliminated.\nEuroBasket 2022.\nGeorgia was the co-host the EuroBasket 2022, and they automatically qualified for the 2022 finals tournament. This was the fifth successive time that Georgia qualified for the event overall. Tbilisi was one of the host cities, and was used for Group A matches at the brand new Tbilisi Basketball Arena.\nThe Foundation.\nThe core of the national team that has consistently qualified to Europe's biggest basketball competition consisted of captain Zaza Pachulia, Viktor Sanikidze, Manuchar Markoishvili, Tornike Shengelia, Giorgi Tsintsadze and Giorgi Shermadini. These pioneers in the Georgian basketball community have set the standard for future generations of the national team to build upon, and maintain.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the EuroBasket 2025 Pre-Qualifiers matches on 23 and 26 February 2024 against Denmark and Serbia.\nPast rosters.\n2011 EuroBasket: finished 11th among 24 teams\n4 Giorgi Gamqrelidze, 5 Vladimir Boisa, 6 Anatoli Boisa, 7 Zaza Pachulia, 8 Giorgi Tsintsadze, 9 Giorgi Shermadini,&lt;br&gt;10 Lasha Parghalava, 11 Manuchar Markoishvili, 12 MarQuez Haynes, 13 Viktor Sanikidze, 14 Tornike Shengelia, 15 Nikoloz Tskitishvili&lt;br&gt;(Coach: Igor Kokoškov)\n2013 EuroBasket: finished 17th among 24 teams\n4 Nika Metreveli, 5 Otar Pkhakadze, 6 Duda Sanadze, 7 Beka Burjanadze, 8 Giorgi Tsintsadze, 9 Giorgi Shermadini, 10 Ricky Hickman,&lt;br&gt;11 Manuchar Markoishvili, 12 Levan Patsatsia, 13 Viktor Sanikidze, 14 Besik Lezhava, 15 Nikoloz Tskitishvili (Coach: Igor Kokoškov)\n2015 EuroBasket: finished 15th among 24 teams\n0 Jacob Pullen, 4 Nika Metreveli, 7 Zaza Pachulia (C), 8 Giorgi Tsintsadze, 9 Giorgi Shermadini, 10 Duda Sanadze,&lt;br&gt;11 Manuchar Markoishvili, 12 Levan Patsatsia, 13 Viktor Sanikidze, 15 Beka Burjanadze, 23 Tornike Shengelia, 25 Besik Lezhava&lt;br&gt;(Coach: Igor Kokoškov)\n2017 EuroBasket: finished 17th among 24 teams\n3 Michael Dixon, 4 Giorgi Gamqrelidze, 6 Anatoli Boisa, 7 Zaza Pachulia (C), 8 Giorgi Tsintsadze, 9 Giorgi Shermadini,&lt;br&gt;10 Duda Sanadze, 11 Manuchar Markoishvili, 17 Mikheil Berishvili, 23 Tornike Shengelia, 35 Goga Bitadze, 99 Ilia Londaridze&lt;br&gt;(Coach: Ilias Zouros)\n2022 EuroBasket: finished 21st among 24 teams\n4 Rati Andronikashvili, 5 Sandro Mamukelashvili, 6 Kakhaber Jintcharadze, 7 Beka Burjanadze, 8 Giorgi Tsintsadze,&lt;br&gt;9 Giorgi Shermadini (C), 10 Duda Sanadze, 17 Mikheil Berishvili, 18 Merab Bokolishvili, 25 Thad McFadden, 33 Beka Bekauri,&lt;br&gt;35 Goga Bitadze (Coach: Ilias Zouros)\n2023 FIBA World Cup: finished 16th among 32 teams\n4 Rati Andronikashvili, 5 Sandro Mamukelashvili, 6 Kakhaber Jintcharadze, 7 Luka Liklikadze, 8 Giorgi Tsintsadze, 9 Giorgi Shermadini,&lt;br&gt;10 Duda Sanadze, 11 Giorgi Turdziladze, 17 Mikheil Berishvili, 23 Tornike Shengelia (C), 25 Thad McFadden, 35 Goga Bitadze&lt;br&gt;(Coach: Ilias Zouros)"

        "text": "The épée event for amateurs was one of three épée events at the 1900 Summer Olympics. 102 fencers from 11 nations competed, with 91 of them from France. The event was won by Ramón Fonst of Cuba, the first of his two golds in individual épée. Silver and bronze both went to host nation fencers, Louis Perrée and Léon Sée. These badly organized games derisively called “The Farcical Games” were so poorly publicized that years later, even the competitors were clueless that they had competed in the Olympics in 1900. No official records for the games exist. These accomplishments are not even mentioned in the 1911 \"Encyclopædia Britannica\". This was the first appearance of the event, as only foil and sabre events had been held at the first Games in 1896; the Men's épée event has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1900.\nCompetition format.\nThe event used a four-round format: round 1, quarterfinals, semifinals, and a final. Each round consisted of pool play. For round 1, the fencers were divided into 17 pools of 6 or 7 fencers each; the top two fencers in each pool advanced to the quarterfinals. The quarterfinals were intended to divide the 34 fencers into 6 pools of 5 or 6 fencers each; after 3 men withdrew, the round consisted of 5 pools of 6 fencers plus a special pool of the last remaining fencer plus 4 of the losers from the first 5 pools. The top 3 fencers in each pool advanced to the semifinals. The semifinals had the 18 men compete in 3 pools of 6, with the top 3 in each pool advancing to a 9-man final.\nThe actual competition format within pools is not entirely clear. Only results from the final are known. In the final, each fencer had 5 or 6 bouts (rather than 8, which would be the number if a full round-robin were held). The top places were determined by number of wins, with a barrage held when two fencers finished with 4 wins (though one had only 1 loss while the other had 2).\nResults.\nRound 1.\nThe first round of the event consisted of pool play round-robin tournaments. Each fencer faced each other fencer once. Of the 17 pools, 15 had six fencers each and 2 had seven. The top two placers in each advanced to the quarterfinals.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe quarterfinals were again round-robin affairs. The original schedule was that there would be six pools: two would have five fencers each and four would have six fencers, with the top three in each pool to advance.\nAfter three of the original quarterfinalists (Maurice Jay, André Rabel, and Jean-Joseph Renaud) withdrew after the draw, the quarterfinals were redrawn: there were five pools with six fencers each, while the sixth pool included Holzchuch and four fencers who had lost in other quarterfinals and were given a second chance to advance.\nSemifinals.\nThe semifinals, with 18 fencers left, were conducted in three pools of round-robin play. Each pool had six fencers, with the top three advancing to the final.\nFinal.\nIn the final, each fencer had either 5 or 6 bouts. Fonst and Perrée initially tied for first with 4 wins each, then Fonst won the barrage to break the tie."

A professional foil event was held in 1900, with épée and sabre joining in 1904. The professional events were not held again afterwards (excepting the 1906 Intercalated Games, so this was the only time that masters épée was contested. The épée events also featured a unique competition: an amateurs-masters épée event.

        "text": "The amateurs-masters épée was an event at the 1900 Summer Olympics. It was held on 15 June at the Tuileries Garden. There were 8 competitors from two nations (France and Cuba). The event was won by Albert Ayat of France. Ramón Fonst of Cuba took silver, while Léon Sée of France earned bronze.\nThis event highlighted the singular position of the sport of fencing in the early Olympic movement. In most of the other sports on the program, competitors had to be amateurs. Furthermore, amateur standing was typically lost when one competed against a professional, even if there was no money involved in that particular competition. In fencing, however, professionals were allowed to compete in the Olympics.\nThe 1900 amateurs-masters épée fencing event pitted the best amateur épéeists against the best professionals. The top four placers in each of those two events were qualified to compete in the open event, which consisted of a single round-robin tournament with single-touch bouts. The gold medal in the event was taken by a master, but the next three places all went to amateurs. \nBackground.\nFencing was the only sport that had professional competitions at the Olympics in 1900 and 1904. A professional foil event was held in 1900, with épée and sabre joining in 1904. The professional events were not held again afterwards (excepting the 1906 Intercalated Games. The épée events also featured a unique competition: an amateurs-masters épée event. The top 4 fencers in the masters épée event, as well as the top 4 fencers in the amateurs épée event, were eligible for this competition. It was the only time an amateurs-masters competition was held at the Olympics.\nQualification.\nThe qualification for this event was through the results of other 1900 Olympic events, rather than being determined before the Games as most modern events. The top 4 fencers in the final pool of each of the masters and amateurs épée events were eligible to compete in this event.\nCompetition format.\nA single round of round-robin pool fencing was held. The 8 fencers each faced all others. Bouts were to 1 touch."

        "text": "The amateur foil competition had 54 fencers from 10 nations compete. There was no limit on the number of fencers per nation; 39 of the 54 competitors were French. For the first round, quarterfinals, and repechage, skill and art with the foil was more important to advancing than winning the bout. The event was swept by French fencers: Émile Coste, Henri Masson, and Marcel Boulenger took the top three places. It was the second consecutive Games that France had taken the top two ranks\nBackground.\nThis was the second appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1908 (when there was a foil display only rather than a medal event). None of the fencers from 1896 returned.\nNine of the ten competing nations were making their debut in the men's foil: Austria, Belgium, Haiti, Italy, Peru, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. Only France had previously competed in 1896.\nCompetition format.\nThe event used a five-round format (four main rounds and a repechage). For the first three rounds (round 1, quarterfinals, repechage) the round consisted of the fencers being paired and fighting a single bout; jury evaluations of skill rather than the match results were used to determine advancement. The last two rounds (semifinals and finals) used round-robin pool play with actual results counting toward placement. Standard foil rules were used, including that touches had to be made with the tip of the foil, the target area was limited to the torso, and priority determined the winner of double touches.\nResults.\nRound 1.\nEach fencer had one bout. The result of the bout did not determine advancement; a jury determined which fencers displayed the most skill. The winner of each bout is unknown. 37 fencers advanced to the quarterfinals. Bouts 1 through 18 were held on 14 May; bouts 19 through 27 were held on 15 May.\nQuarterfinals.\nAgain, jury verdicts were used in place of match results to determine those advancing to the semifinals. 10 fencers were selected to advance to the semifinals directly, while 14 were sent to the repechage. Three fencers withdrew. Cahan fenced twice, while Sénat did not fence at all.\nRepechage.\nThe matchups in the repechage are not known. Once again, jury verdicts rather than match results mattered. 6 fencers were selected to advance to the semifinals. De Saint-Agnan was selected as an alternate, later competing in the consolation final after the withdrawal of Renaud.\nSemifinals.\nThe semifinals were the first round of the foil tournament to use match results in determining advancement. The 16 fencers were divided into two pools. Each fencer then faced each other fencer in his pool once. The four fencers with the best record in each pool moved on to the finals, with the other four competing in the consolation. A barrage was used to break a tie between 4th and 5th place.\nSemifinal B.\nThe win–loss record of fencers in this semifinal is not known.\nFinals.\nClassification 9–16.\nThe eight fencers who had placed in the bottom four of each pool in the semifinals competed for 9th to 16th places in the consolation pool. Renaud withdrew, making room for de Saint-Aignan to be activated from alternate status. The win–loss record of fencers in this pool is not known.\nFinal.\nThe final was held on 21 May 1900. The top four fencers in each of the two semifinals competed against each other, each fencing the other seven once."

        "title": "Don Black (baseball)",
        "text": "Donald Paul Black (July 20, 1916 or 1917 – April 21, 1959) was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for six seasons in the American League with the Philadelphia Athletics and Cleveland Indians. In 154 career games, Black pitched 797 innings and posted a win–loss record of 34–55, with 37 complete games, four shutouts, and a 4.35 earned run average (ERA).\nBorn in Salix, Iowa, he played minor league baseball in Fairbury, Nebraska, and Petersburg, Virginia, before signing with the Philadelphia Athletics. He played with them for three seasons before being released. Black signed with the Cleveland Indians at the end of 1945, and after a season with them joined Alcoholics Anonymous. After completing the program, during the off season, he then played two more seasons with Cleveland, pitching a no-hitter on July 10, 1947. On September 13, 1948, Black suffered a cerebral hemorrhage on the field, which marked the end of his professional career. After a comeback attempt, Black went on to become a sports announcer and salesman. He died in 1959.\nEarly life and minor leagues.\nBlack was born in Salix, Iowa. He had his first taste of professional baseball in 1937, when he was signed by the Fairbury Jeffs of the Nebraska State League. The Jeffs were the rookie-level minor league team of the St. Louis Browns farm system. He played alongside two others who would later make the major leagues, George Bradley and Johnny Lucadello. Black pitched in 26 games for the Jeffs, posting a 5–11 record, 154 innings pitched, and a 4.85 ERA. He spent the next three years out of professional baseball, then signed a contract with the Petersburg Rebels of the Virginia League.\nBlack spent the 1941 and 1942 seasons with the Rebels. In 1941, he pitched in 19 games, starting 16 of them. He won 11 games, lost five, and had an ERA of 2.35. He also threw the first no-hitter of his career that season. The following season, Black pitched in 34 games for the rebels, tying for the team lead with Lou Knerr. He pitched 235 innings, winning 18 games, losing 11, and finishing with an ERA of 2.49. Black was selected for the 1942 Virginia League All-Star game, though did not attend as, instead, he was at the hospital where his wife gave birth to their second child, a daughter. He also threw the second no-hitter of his career, which led to a tryout with the Philadelphia Athletics.\nPhiladelphia Athletics.\nWhen he was called up by the Athletics, Black worked to earn a spot on the roster in spring training. After performances which included a 2–0 victory over the University of Delaware baseball team where he struck out three in an inning, he was awarded a spot on the Athletics' roster for the 1943 Philadelphia Athletics season. That pitching rotation featured many other rookie pitchers including Jesse Flores. Black made his major league debut on April 24, 1943, and was in the Athletics' starting rotation most of the season. He had some early success in his career, pitching a one-hitter on May 30 against the St. Louis Browns in a 3–0 victory. Black finished the season with a 6–16 record, a 4.20 ERA, and 208 innings pitched. He also pitched 110 bases on balls, and hit six batters with pitches; both numbers were second highest in the American League.\nBlack remained in the starting rotation at the beginning of the 1944 Philadelphia Athletics season, despite the possibility of him being drafted into the United States Army for World War II. He was rejected for military service after a physical examination on June 22, and remained with the team throughout the season. His win total improved from last season; however, he went a span of about a month, from June 28 until late July, without a victory. He finished the season with a 10–12 record, a 4.06 ERA, and 27 games started, second highest on the team behind Bobo Newsom. At the end of the season, there were rumors that manager Connie Mack was planning to trade Black and Frankie Hayes to Cleveland for Jim Bagby, Jr. and Jeff Heath, though Mack stated there was no substance to the rumors.\nThe following season, Black was part of an optimistic Athletics team, so much so that coach Earle Mack felt Black, Newsom, Flores, and Russ Christopher were the best quartet of starting pitchers in the league. He started the season being considered the ace of the staff, as the others in the rotation were either battling injury or not yet fully conditioned. His third season in the majors, however, ended with little success. Early on in the season, Black missed some playing time as a result of a badly bruised finger. He was later suspended for a month for violation of team rules. Upon his return, Connie Mack noted that it would be Black's \"last chance\" to avoid trouble. He finished the season with a 5–11 record and a 5.17 ERA. This was Black's final season on the Athletics. At the conclusion of the season, he was sold to the Cleveland Indians for an undisclosed amount. Connie Mack later stated he regretfully fired him due to his alcohol use, leading to him not being dependable as a pitcher.\nCleveland Indians.\nBlack began the 1946 Cleveland Indians season as a member of the roster, looking to see playing time in an established starting rotation. His season began inauspiciously when he was hit on the chin with a ball, causing him to miss a week during spring training. The 1946 season marked the first time Black did not finish on the major league roster. After pitching in 18 games for the Indians, he was sent to the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association. While with the Brewers, Black failed to win any games, and at one point was suspended after he disappeared during a road trip. At the conclusion of the season, Indians owner Bill Veeck had a talk with Black, who admitted he had a problem with drunkenness. He agreed to spend the winter with Alcoholics Anonymous with Veek's help, and by the time the 1947 Cleveland Indians season began, Black was sober.\nThe year 1947 became a career year for the now-sober Black. There was optimism in the Indians clubhouse regarding his talent, with manager Lou Boudreau saying that Black was \"a leading candidate for one of our starting jobs.\" In his first pitching appearance of the season against the Detroit Tigers, a tough 5–3 victory, someone in the press box said, \"I wonder what he'd give for a slug of bourbon\", to which he replied, \"All I wanted in that situation was a fresh stick of chewing gum. Bourbon doesn't even tempt me.\" He followed this with a 1–0 shutout win against the Chicago White Sox. A game against his former team, the Philadelphia Athletics, became the highlight of his career. On July 10, 1947, Black no-hit the Athletics 3–0 at Cleveland Stadium, allowing six walks and five strikeouts in besting Bill McCahan—himself a no-hit pitcher on September 3 of that 1947 season. Only Eddie Joost came close to getting a hit on Black, hitting a ball in the eighth inning that just barely went foul. On top of his no-hit performance, Black had two singles and a squeeze bunt that day. He was modest about his performance afterwards, saying \"My control was pretty bad. I got behind on a lot of hitters, but they didn't seem to hit me.\" Black finished the season with ten wins, 12 losses, a 3.92 ERA, eight complete games, and three shutouts. At the end of the season, he was planning to play in the Cuban Winter League along with fellow Indians Bob Feller and Al López, though this did not eventuate. During the off-season, Black returned to his hometown of Salix, where he was given a key to the city and made honorary mayor for a day.\nThe 1948 Cleveland Indians season began with Black maintaining a spot in the starting rotation. He had spent the off-season selling tickets for the Indians in Hot Springs, Arkansas. After signing a new contract, Black earned his first victory of 1948 on May 23 in a doubleheader against the New York Yankees, winning 5–1 in the second game. Early on in the season, due to the Indians' pitching depth, Black, along with Al Gettel and Bob Muncrief, lost their starting jobs and were moved to the bullpen, though there were plans to still use Black occasionally as a starter. He missed some playing time in June as the result of a bone chip in his left big toe, suffered during batting practice. He pitched for the Indians for most of the rest of the season, making ten starts in 18 total appearances, finishing the season with two wins and losses, a 5.37 ERA, and 52 innings pitched.\nAbout a month before the end of the season, Black pitched his final professional baseball game. During the height of the 1948 pennant race, on September 13 in Cleveland, Black suffered a cerebral hemorrhage while batting in the second inning during a home game against the St. Louis Browns. He had fouled off a pitch into the upper deck of the stadium, and then collapsed holding onto his neck. He was able to walk to the dugout, but had lost consciousness by the time an ambulance arrived. Black was taken to St. Vincent Charity Hospital and was conscious for a time, but lapsed into a coma. His doctor noted that he was likely to make a full recovery, though he was \"through with baseball for this year and possibly for good.\" After a few days in critical condition, he had begun to recover and his condition was reported to have improved greatly.\nIn response to Black's injury, the Indians hosted a \"Don Black Night\" on September 23 in a game against the Boston Red Sox to help raise money for his medical bills. In that game, watched by 76,772 fans, the Indians raised $40,370 for Black as they won the game, 5–2. The Indians went on to defeat the Red Sox in a one-game playoff for the American League pennant and the Boston Braves in six games in the 1948 World Series as Black recovered in the hospital. After the Indians won the World Series, Lou Boudreau said that the Indians won the title in his honor.\nLater life.\nAfter a stay of six weeks, Black was released from the hospital in late October 1948. He continued to suffer from headaches, however, and had to have further surgery done in December to remove a weak spot in an artery near his head. He was released from the hospital shortly afterward, but by the start of 1949 his time with the Indians was over, as Veeck stated he would not accept the responsibility of allowing Black to pitch again, though said \"If Black is determined to try it again, I won't stand in his way.\" This statement, however, did not keep Black away, as he signed a contract in late January with the Indians for the same amount as the previous season. After pitching with the Indians in Florida in spring training, he returned to Cleveland and decided to retire temporarily, citing that he felt too weak to be effective. He made one final pitching appearance before retiring in an exhibition game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 13, pitching two innings for the Indians in a 1–0 loss.\nAfter his retirement from baseball, Black went on to become a sportscaster, automobile salesman and insurance salesman. He lived with his wife, Joyce, and his two daughters, Stevie and Donna, in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. In December 1957, Black was injured in a car accident in Virginia, leaving him in critical condition. He recovered and spent the summer of 1958 teaching for the city recreation department. The following year, on April 21, 1959, Black died in Cuyahoga Falls while watching an Indians game at his home."

        "text": "The North Carolina Tar Heels baseball team, commonly referred to as Carolina, represents the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in NCAA Division I college baseball. They compete in the Coastal Division of the Atlantic Coast Conference. The Tar Heels play their home games on campus at Boshamer Stadium, and are currently coached by Scott Forbes.\nHistory.\nThe program's first recorded game took place in 1867, when the Tar Heels defeated a Raleigh all-star team, 34-17. Although baseball continued to be played at UNC, there exists a gap in record-keeping during Reconstruction, despite the noted existence of the UNC baseball team. The program's next recorded games were played in 1891. Thereafter, the University sponsored a varsity intercollegiate baseball program on a regular basis from that season onwards.\nIn 1921, the University of North Carolina became a founding member of the Southern Conference. Bunny Hearn became head coach of the Tar Heel baseball program in 1932, serving in that capacity for the next 15 years. The Tar Heels would win six Southern Conference baseball titles during the Hearn era, as well as two wartime Ration League titles in 1943 and 1945. In 1947, Hearn suffered a stroke and chose to relinquish his head coaching duties. Walter Rabb would thereafter take over as head coach of the Tar Heel baseball program, though Hearn remained as a coach at North Carolina for another ten years.\nDuring the 1948 season, the program qualified for its first NCAA tournament, which had first been played in 1947. North Carolina's record in the tournament was 1-2.\nNorth Carolina left the Southern Conference in 1953, opting to become a founding member of the newly formed Atlantic Coast Conference. The Tar Heels won their first ACC baseball title in 1960. The program's first College World Series appearance also came in 1960. In 1964, the Tar Heels won their second ACC baseball title, posting an undefeated record in conference play. No other team in ACC baseball history has ever been undefeated in conference\nplay.\nThe Tar Heels would appear in the College World Series three more times during the 20th century.\nThe Tar Heels reached the College World Series in four consecutive years between 2006 and 2009, and five times in six years between 2006 and 2011. They reached the national championship series in both 2006 and 2007, but lost on both occasions to the Oregon State Beavers. The Tar Heels made a third straight trip to Omaha in 2008.\nWhile Boshamer Stadium was being renovated and rebuilt during the 2008 season, the Tar Heels played their home games at the USA Baseball National Training Complex in nearby Cary. The Tar Heels returned to Chapel Hill in February 2009, following the completion of the extensive renovations to Boshamer Stadium. The Tar Heels reached the 2009 College World Series, the program's fourth consecutive College World Series appearance, following their first season playing in newly renovated Boshamer Stadium.\nThe Tar Heels once again reached the College World Series in 2011. The Tar Heels were the top overall seed in the 2013 NCAA baseball tournament, during which they reached the 2013 College World Series once again. In 2018, the Tar Heels reached the College World Series for the seventh time in thirteen seasons.\nBoshamer Stadium.\nBoshamer Stadium, the program's home venue, originally opened in 1972 and was renovated in the late 2000s. It has a capacity of 4,100 spectators, with additional standing room. It has hosted five ACC tournaments, most recently in 1983. It is centrally located on the University campus, adjacent to Ehringhaus Residence Hall and Karen Shelton Stadium.\nNotable alumni.\nCurrent MLB roster.\nFormer Tar Heels on MLB opening day roster 2023 (updated March 30, 2023)."

A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on August 3, 1997.\nThe BBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1977 or later, but not after 1991; the ballot included candidates from the 1996 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1991. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. The ballot consisted of 30 players; 473 ballots were cast, with 353 votes required for election. A total of 2,515 individual votes were cast, an average of 5.32 per ballot—breaking the record low of 5.72 votes per ballot set the previous election (the election of 2012 would break 1997's record, with an average of 5.1 names per ballot). Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote (24 votes) will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†).

Born in Decatur, Illinois, he batted left-handed, threw right-handed, stood and weighed .\nBauer had a ten-year minor league playing career in the farm systems of the St. Louis Cardinals and the New York Yankees, where he was used primarily at third base, but also in right and left field. Late in his playing career, Bauer was a player-manager.\nFrom 1953 to 1957, Bauer was part of the Cardinals system, making stops in Alexandria of the Evangeline League, Odessa of the Longhorn League, Lynchburg of the Piedmont League, Peoria of the Three-I League, and Winston-Salem of the Carolina League. His best season for the Cardinals was 1954, when he hit .320 and drove in 96 RBI for Odessa.\nFrom 1958 to 1962, Bauer played and managed in the Yankees system, making stops in Greensboro of the Carolina League, Auburn of the New York–Penn League, and St. Petersburg and Ft. Lauderdale of the Florida State League as a player. His best season for the Yankees was 1959, when he hit .332 and drove in 74 RBI for Auburn.\n1959 was also Bauer's first year as a player-manager. He managed Auburn in 1960 as well, leading the team to a third-place finish and a playoff berth. In 1961, he skippered the St. Petersburg Saints. In 1962, his last season as a player-manager, he led the Fort Lauderdale Yankees to a Florida State League championship.\nBauer left baseball for the 1963 and 1964 seasons, but returned to manage Johnson City of the Appalachian League in 1965 and 1966. In 1967, he managed the Greensboro Yankees in the Carolina League. When the Yankees moved their Carolina League affiliate from Greensboro to Kinston in 1968, he moved with them.
