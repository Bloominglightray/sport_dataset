        "text": " \nThe Montenegro national handball team represents Montenegro in international handball competitions. The national team was formed in 2006 shortly after Montenegro became independent.\nMontenegro played their first official match on 3 January 2007 in Vantaa and beat Finland (28:26). Since then, Montenegro have qualified for nine big competitions – twice for the World Cup (2013 and 2023) and for the European Championship in 2008, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022 and 2024.\nHistory and records.\nThe national side first appeared in the Euro 2008 qualifiers, which started in January 2007. After the great success in the qualifying matches, Montenegro participated at the European Championship 2008, where they finished in the second group phase. \nA year later, Montenegro failed to qualify for the World Championship 2009 and after that, there was a crisis in the results of national team.\nFrom 2012, results improved. After a surprise win against Sweden in the qualifiers, Montenegro qualified for the World Championship 2013.\nIn June 2013, Montenegro eliminated Germany in the final round of qualifiers for the European Championship 2014. At the Championship, Montenegro was eliminated in the first phase.\nTwo years later, the Montenegrin team appeared at the European Championship 2016, but was eliminated after the first phase of the competition, without any win in three matches. Same result, Montenegro made on European Championship 2018. Finally, on European Championship 2020, Montenegro made historical victory against Serbia \"(22-21)\", but failed to qualify to the second round of tournament.\nNational team matches.\n\"Updated: January 23, 2023\"\nCompetitive record.\nWorld Championship.\nThe national team of Montenegro made their first appearance at the World Cup in 2013, from their 3rd qualifying attempt.

At the tournament, Montenegro lost all three games, with elimination after the first phase.\nMontenegro hoped for a better result in 2016, but it was pretty much deja vu from two years ago as they once again lost all three games and finished in last place in their group, as well as last place in the tournament claiming 16th place out of 16 teams.\nTeam.\nCurrent squad.\nSquad for the 2024 European Men's Handball Championship\nHead coach: Vlado Šola\n1st: \"red/red\"\n2nd: \"green/green\"\n3rd: \"black/black\"\nGK: \"yellow/green/blue\"\nHead coaches.\nSince independence, Montenegro was led by eight different coaches.

        "title": "Cycling at the 1956 Summer Olympics – Men's sprint",
        "text": "The men's sprint or \"scratch race\" at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia, was held from 3 to 6 December 1956. There were 18 participants representing 18 nations in competition, with one additional non-starter. Each nation was limited to one cyclist. The event was won by Michel Rousseau of France, the nation's first victory in the men's sprint since 1928 and fifth overall. Guglielmo Pesenti of Italy earned silver and Dick Ploog of Australia finished third for bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 11th appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1904 and 1912. None of the semifinalists from 1952 returned. The favorite was Michel Rousseau of France, the reigning world champion. His main competitor (the runner-up at the last two world championships), Jorge Batiz of Argentina, did not compete in Melbourne.\nBrazil, Colombia, and Vietnam each made their debut in the men's sprint. France made its 11th appearance, the only nation to have competed at every appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThis track cycling event consisted of numerous rounds: four main rounds and a two-round repechage. Each race involved the riders starting simultaneously and next to each other, from a standing start. Because the early part of races tend to be slow-paced and highly tactical, only the time for the last 200 metres of the one-kilometre race is typically recorded.\nThe trend in the Olympic sprint competition was toward expansion of a best-of-three match format (beginning in 1932 for the final, expanding in 1936 and 1948 to more rounds). The 1952 edition had bucked that trend by returning to an entirely single-race format for the first time since 1928; the 1956 event returned to it, reversing many of the format changes made four years earlier.\nThe first round consisted of six heats of three cyclists each (one was scheduled to have four, but a withdrawal left it with only three). The winner of each heat advanced to the quarterfinals. The Official Report says that the eight fastest losers went to the repechage, but this is a very odd advancement rule for the sprint competition in which time is generally not relevant. Cycling Magazine provides results of repechage heats more consistent with all losers going to the repechage, which would be a much more common rule in a sprint event. In either case, there were four repechage semifinals; the winner of each moved on to the repechage finals while all others were eliminated. The repechage finals were two heats of two cyclists, with the winners rejoining the round 1 victors in the quarterfinals while the losers were eliminated.\nThe quarterfinals began the best-of-three rounds. The eight quarterfinalists were paired into four matches; the winner of a match was the first cyclist to win two races. The four winners moved on to the semifinals while the losers were eliminated. The semifinals again were best-of-three, with the winners moving on to the final and the losers going to a bronze medal match. Both of the medal matches were best-of-three as well.\nRecords.\nThe records for the sprint are 200 metre flying time trial records, kept for the qualifying round in later Games as well as for the finish of races.\nDick Ploog broke the Olympic record and matched the world record in the first race of the competition, finishing the last 200 metres in 11.4 seconds. This time was not beaten, but was matched multiple times: Michel Rousseau in the second race of quarterfinal 1, Warren Johnston in the first race of quarterfinal 4, Rousseau again in the first race of semifinal 1, Ploog in the second race of the bronze medal match, and Rousseau in both in both races of the final.\nResults.\nRound 1.\nRound 1 heat 1.\nLeón Mejía is listed as third place in this heat in the Official Report (with Lê fourth), but the Official Report also has a photograph of heat 3 which shows Mejía in that heat. Cycling Magazine reported the results as below. Mejía was likely moved to heat 3 after Günther Ziegler's withdrawal.\nRound 1 heat 3.\nZiegler is listed as third place in this heat in the Official Report, but the Official Report also has a photograph of the heat which shows León Mejía. Cycling Magazine reported the results as below. Mejía was likely moved to heat 3 after Ziegler's withdrawal.\nRound 1 heat 5.\nNyman is listed as third place in the heat in the Official Report, but Cycling Magazine indicates he did not start.\nRepechage semifinals.\nRepechage semifinal 1.\nThe Official report lists only Godefroid and Shah-Rukh, but Cycling Magazine recorded Lê as third place in the first heat of the repechage.\nRepechage semifinal 2.\nThe Official Report shows only Shardelow and Mejía, but Cycling Magazine indicates that all losers of the first round went to the repechage. It also identifies the cyclists in the other three heats, leaving Nyman. If Nyman did compete in the first round (which is unclear), he would have been assigned to this repechage heat; he did not start in it, however.\nRepechage semifinal 3.\nThe Official Report lists only Argenton and Mitchell, but Cycling Magazine places Markus third in this heat.\nRepechage semifinal 4.\nThe Official Report lists only Johnston and Masanés, but Cycling Magazine places Harrison third in this heat.\nRepechage finals.\nRepechage final 1.\nJohnston won by a length.\nRepechage final 2.\nShardelow won by inches.\nQuarterfinals.\nQuarterfinal 2.\nPloog had a puncture on the first race, which was restarted.\nSemifinals.\nSemifinal 2.\nPloog had a puncture on the second race, which was restarted. In the third race, Ploog stopped, thinking he had been fouled; his protest was denied."

        "title": "Mosman Rugby Club",
        "text": "Mosman Rugby Club (known as The Mosman Whales) is an Australian rugby union club. It is based is Mosman on the Lower North Shore of Sydney. Home games are played at Rawson Oval and Balmoral Oval. Mosman won the first Kentwell Cup in 1923 and Mosman continues to compete in Division One of the New South Wales Suburban Rugby Union.\nEarly years.\nMosman's first rugby team was formed in 1893 and played its first match wearing a variety of dark jumpers with single white stars stitched on the front. It did not become a club or compete in official competitions until the following year.\nThe suburb's first rugby club was formed in 1894 as Mosman's Bay Junior Football Club and entered the Third Junior 'B' Division involving ten teams. The club's colours were officially listed as 'Navy with 4 inch Pink Band'.\nMosman played its first match on 26 May 1894 against 'Union', a junior club from inner-Sydney, and finished its inaugural season in 7th place with four wins and five losses.\nOne of Mosman's foundation players was Denis 'Dinny' Lutge who would become Mosman's only dual rugby international. After joining North Sydney in 1900 he played in Australia's inaugural Rugby Union test against New Zealand in August 1903 and three tests against the visiting Great Britain side in 1904.\nIn 1908 Lutge joined the switch to Rugby League and played against New Zealand in Australia's first official Rugby League series. When the first Kangaroos were selected to visit Great Britain in 1908–09, he was elected tour captain by the players.\nSydney's sub-districts rugby (now known as the New South Wales Suburban Rugby Union or \"Subbies\") gained its first major trophy in 1923, when W. H. Kentwell, then president of Mosman Rugby, presented the Kentwell Cup. Eight teams competed in that first Kentwell Cup, with Mosman the winner. It remains the trophy of Subbies First Division. In 1924, Mosman's vice-president, James A. Burke, presented the Burke Cup for subdistricts second graders.\nRecent developments.\nSince its foundation Mosman has competed at a high level in many different competitions and grades but has always valued a balance between playing success and mateship and camaraderie off the field.\nIn 1989 the Club embarked on its most ambitious project, the refurbishment of its home ground facilities at Rawson Park. This required a huge effort on the part of the Committee of the day - dealing with Local Council and State and Federal Governments of different political persuasions proved interesting. Four years and $500,000 later, and with the help of Mosman Council and Telecom, the doors to the Clubhouse were opened on 26 September 1992.\nIn 2019, Mosman fielded seven grade teams and 3 Colts teams (Under 21s) in the NSW Suburban Rugby Union's 1st Division as well as 35 junior teams. Registrations in general represent over 200 grade players, 80 colts players and over 450 juniors drawn predominantly from the local area.\nExternal links.\n "

        "title": "Utah Utes men's basketball",
        "text": "The Utah Utes men's basketball team, also known as the Runnin' Utes, represents the University of Utah as an NCAA Division I program that plays in the Pac-12 Conference. They play their home games at the Jon M. Huntsman Center. The school has made the NCAA tournament 29 times, which ranks 20th in NCAA history and tied for third most appearances behind UCLA and the University of Arizona in the Western United States. They last made the tournament in 2016. Utah won the NCAA Championship in 1944, defeating Dartmouth College 42–40 for the school's only NCAA basketball championship. However, the school also claims the 1916 AAU National Championship, which was awarded after winning the AAU national tournament. They have also won the NIT once, defeating Kentucky in 1947. In 1998, the Utes played in the NCAA championship game, losing to Kentucky.\nHistory.\nUtah began play in 1908, finishing with a record of 3–8. However, by 1916, they had won their first national championship, winning the National AAU Tournament. The team would compete in the tournament two other times, in 1918 and 1919. But it wasn't until 1927 that Utah really began laying the foundation for what would become one of the winningest programs in college basketball.\nThat began with the hiring of Vadal Peterson, who would become the winningest coach in Utah basketball history. Peterson would guide Utah to 6 conference and state championships and reached the ultimate prize in 1944, when the Utes won the national championship. Oddly enough, Utah had turned down a bid to the NCAA tournament because they wanted to play in the NIT. However, after being bounced in the first round by Kentucky, Utah was given a second chance to play in the NCAA tournament. The Arkansas Razorbacks were forced to withdraw after two of their players were badly injured in a car accident. Needing another team to take the Razorbacks' place, the NCAA invited Utah. The Utes accepted and went on to defeat Dartmouth 42–40. Arnie Ferrin was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player after scoring 28 points in the final two games. Three years later, Peterson would lead Utah to the more prestigious NIT championship, as they defeated, ironically enough, Kentucky 49–45. Peterson would retire from Utah with a 385–230 (.626) record and is the only coach in Utah history to have won a national championship.\nWataru Misaka — who had led the Utah Utes to the 1944 NCAA and 1947 NIT championships — later became the first person of color to play in modern professional basketball when he joined the New York Knicks, just months after Jackie Robinson had broken the color barrier in Major League Baseball for the Brooklyn Dodgers.\nAfter Peterson retired, Utah basketball was known as one of the strongest in the west. That tradition helped convince Kansas State head coach Jack Gardner to accept the job. Gardner had led the Wildcats to two Final Fours prior to accepting the job and during his 18 years at Utah, he built a legacy that many today feel is the strongest in Utah history.\nThe Gardner era.\nJack Gardner was known for his quick offenses, which is where Utah got its name as the Runnin' Redskins (later changed to the Utes). Because of his radical offensive sets, the Utes were widely regarded as the team that helped usher in a new era of college basketball. By his second season, Gardner had the Utes in their first NCAA Tournament since the 1945 season and the Utes dominated their way to a conference championship. Finishing the year 24–4, Utah reached #7 in the rankings, but was eliminated in the second round.\nIn Gardner's third season he once again guided the Utes to a conference championship and an NCAA tournament berth. That year the Utes climbed to 11th in the polls and made it to the Elite Eight, before bowing out to eventual champion San Francisco, who was led by future NBA legend and Hall of Famer Bill Russell. The Utes kept their postseason streak alive for Gardner's fourth and fifth seasons, making the NIT, however, they lost in the first round both years. In 1959, Utah again returned to the NCAA tournament, before losing to Idaho State in the second round. The Utes would make the NCAA tournament again in 1960, and were defeated in the second round, this time by USC.\n1961 Final Four.\nAfter getting eliminated in the second round in consecutive years, Jack Gardner and Utah finally made a run at the national championship in 1961. That year the Utes finished 23–8 and 12–2 in conference play. They were ranked 11th in the nation and faced Loyola-California in the first round. The Utes easily won 91–75 and advanced to the Elite Eight, where they defeated Arizona State 88–80, to make the school's first Final Four in 17 years. There they would face the eventual national champions Cincinnati Bearcats, losing 82–67. Though the season had ended short of the national championship, Utah had returned to the national stage and would prove to be a worthy national foe for years to come.\nWestern movement and a return to the Final Four.\nA season after the 1961 Final Four ushered in great change for Utah athletics. The Utes, along with the Arizona, Arizona State, BYU, New Mexico, and Wyoming decided to form the Western Athletic Conference. The highly competitive conference made it far more difficult for the Utes to win, as Gardner struggled in the first three years of the conference's formation. During that span the Utes would go 12–14, 19–9 and 17–9. However, by 1966 Utah was once again ready to make a national splash, after cruising to a conference championship and the program's first tournament berth since the 1961 season during that season.\nUtah received a first round bye and faced Pacific in the semifinals. After a relatively easy 83–74 victory over the Tigers, Utah advanced to the Elite Eight where they would face the Oregon State Beavers. In a highly competitive game, the Utes came out on top, defeating the Beavers 70–64 to once again advance to the Final Four. This was a historical achievement for Jack Gardner, because it made him the first coach to guide two different teams to two Final Fours. But it was the cultural significance of this Final Four that would have far reaching historical impact and change the game of college basketball forever.\nAfter getting by the Beavers, Utah faced Texas Western in the Final Four, with the winner advancing to play Kentucky for the national championship. Though the game was tight, Utah wore down at the end and the Miners edged the Utes 85–78 to advance to the national championship game. There Texas Western, under the leadership of the legendary Don Haskins, started five black players for the first time in NCAA Championship history. Texas Western would go on to defeat Kentucky, led by Adolph Rupp, to claim the 1966 national title, and would be inducted as a team in 2010. Though Utah lost to the Miners in the Final Four, Jerry Chambers was named the Most Outstanding Player, joining Arnie Ferrin as the only other Ute to win the award.\nAfter the Utes' trips to the Final Four, the program would gradually regress in Gardner's final years. Though they posted winning seasons every year, they failed to make the NCAA tournament and only appeared in two NIT tournaments. After the 1971 season, Gardner decided to retire, ending his career at Utah with a 339–154 record. He's the only coach to lead the Utes to two Final Fours and his legacy lives on, as Gardner was integral in getting the athletic department to build the Huntsman Center, the current home to the men's basketball team.\nThe revival of Utah basketball.\nThough the program had proven to be strong under Gardner, the team had struggled during the final years of his coaching career. After his retirement, Utah was faced with the daunting task of not only replacing a legend, but finding a coach who was capable of bringing Utah back to elite status.\nThe Utes looked to New Jersey, Rutgers to be exact, and found a successful unknown coach who had guided the Rutgers basketball team to some of their most successful seasons ever. Bill Foster, in the early part of 1971, was named the head coach of the Runnin' Utes. And though his stay with Utah wasn't long, he was essential to Utah's rebuilding plans. Though Foster got off to a slow start at Utah, going 13–12 and 8–19, his third and final season would prove to be a glimpse into Utah's successful future. He guided the team to a 22–8 season and an NIT berth. In the first round, Utah would face Foster's former team, Rutgers, however, they proved to be no match for the Utes as they easily dispatched of them 102–89. In the second round Utah blew out Memphis State 92–78 and then dominated Boston College 117–93 to advance to the title game. There they faced Purdue and though Utah kept it close, the Boilermakers prevailed, winning 87–81. Even with the loss, Utah basketball was showing signs of returning to its past glory, but it would have to do it under another coach, as Bill Foster quickly left Utah to rebuild Duke.\nUnder coach Jerry Pimm.\nUtah did not have to go far for their next head coach, as they promoted Foster's assistant Jerry Pimm. The hire would prove to a good one, as he would continue what Foster had started. In Pimm's third season he guided the Utes to a conference championship and the NCAA Sweet 16, where they narrowly lost to UNLV. In his fourth year at Utah, he once again guided the Utes to the Sweet 16, however, again coming up short, losing a tough one to Notre Dame. Pimm would take Utah to its third NCAA Tournament in a row, but unlike the past two years, the Utes were upset in the first round by Pepperdine. After a year of not making the NCAA tournament, the Utes returned, crushing Northeastern 94–69, before barely losing to North Carolina 61–56. The Tar Heels would go on to the national championship game before losing to Indiana.\nThough Pimm had been a successful coach at Utah, his relationship was strained with the athletic department and his final season with the Utes occurred in the 1983 campaign. Like he had in years before, Pimm would lead the Utes to the NCAA tournament and yet another Sweet 16 appearance, after Utah knocked off 7th seeded Illinois and then stunned 2nd seed UCLA in the second round. Yet, like in years past, the Utes failed to advance beyond the Sweet 16 and Utah's loss to eventual national champions North Carolina State would be Pimm's last game as Utah's head coach. He left the Utes for UC Santa Barbara. Pimm's record at Utah was 173–86 (.668). He won three conference championships and had four 20+ win seasons.\nStruggles return.\nPimm was gone and Utah was once again looking for a head coach. As with the Pimm hire, Utah stayed in-house and hired Pimm's lead assistant Lynn Archibald, who had previously coached at Idaho State before taking an assistant role with the Runnin' Utes. Though his resume was lacking, Archibald easily endeared himself to Utah fans through his kindness and rather clean image. Unfortunately, that never translated to success on the basketball court, as Archibald's teams often underperformed. Though he had mild success with the Utes, like guiding them to the WAC Championship in 1986 and the NCAA tournament, he could never build on what Foster and Pimm had started. In 6 seasons at Utah, he went 98–86 and though he made three postseason appearances in a row from 1986 to '88, the program never advanced beyond the first round. The final nail in Archibald's coffin came in the 1989 season, where the Utes went 6–10 in conference play. Archibald was fired from Utah, however, the program would reach new heights in the 1990s under the new leadership of Rick Majerus.\nIn 1986 and 1987, Montenegrin playmaker Luka Pavićević played for Utah. Pavićević won European club titles with Croatian team KK Jugoplastika. He was Yugoslav national team and Serbia and Montenegro national basketball team player, and in 2011 he became Montenegro national team coach.\nThe Majerus era.\nWith Archibald gone, a fire that upset many fans, Utah looked to the Midwest for their next coach. Rick Majerus was named the 12th head coach of the University of Utah in April 1989. Although he was fairly unknown, Majerus had just finished possibly the best season in Ball State history, leading the Cardinals to a 29–3 record and a second round appearance in the NCAA tournament. During his run with Utah, he would guide them through the most successful period in the program's history, but it was a run that got off to a slow start.\nShortly after his first season with Utah began, Majerus had to step down because of medical reasons. He faced heart surgery and would not be able to lead the Utes for the rest of the year. The team was taken over by his assistant Joe Cravens and they limped to a 7–9 conference record. However, when Majerus returned for the next season, he was healthy and so was Utah's basketball program.\nIn his first full year as head coach, Majerus guided the Utes to a conference championship and an NCAA Sweet 16 appearance. Though Utah was crushed by undefeated UNLV, the success Majerus had in his first full season with the Utes proved Utah basketball was once again returning to its place as one of the strongest programs in the west.\nDuring this time, a little quirk in the NCAA seeding had Utah facing Kentucky nearly every time they made the tournament. In 1993, the Utes were crushed by the Wildcats 83–62 in the second round. In 1996, the two met in the Sweet 16 with Kentucky defeating Utah 101–70. In 1997, the two would meet in the Elite Eight, with Kentucky winning 72–59, though that game was far more competitive than the final score indicated. The biggest meeting between the two would take place a year later, on the biggest stage and in the biggest game in Utah basketball history.\n1997–98 season: The drive for a championship.\nThe 1998 season kicked off with many predicting the Utes would take a step back. Utah had lost one of its best players in school history, as Keith Van Horn graduated. Yet led by Andre Miller and Michael Doleac, the Utes would begin an improbable run that would guide the program to its first national championship game in 54 years.\nThe Utes had dominated their way to a WAC championship and a top-5 ranking to end the 1998 regular season. They were given a #3 seed in the NCAA tournament and faced San Francisco in the first round. Unlike the last time these two teams met in the NCAA tournament, Utah cruised to an 85–68 victory. In the second round they faced Arkansas and pulled out a 75–69 victory to advance to the school's third straight Sweet 16, where they defeated West Virginia 65–62, giving the Utes a second straight trip to the Elite Eight.\nReaching the Elite Eight for the second time in a row was a feat in and of itself. However, most felt Utah's run would end in 1998, as they were facing #1 seed Arizona, the defending national champions. Yet, using the triangle-and-two defense, Utah defeated Arizona 76–51. The game, one of the worst losses in Wildcat history, pushed Utah to their first Final Four in 32 years, where they beat the #1 overall seed, North Carolina, 65–59.\nHeading into the national championship, Utah was looking to become the first Mid-major Conference team to win the championship since UNLV won it in 1990. Like in the Elite Eight and Final Four, Utah jumped out to a large lead, going into the half up 10. However, they couldn't hold on and Kentucky fought back and using their depth and talent, they took over the game in the final minutes and cruised to a 78–69 victory. Once again the Utes' season was ended at the hands of Kentucky. This time though, it was a loss that cost Utah a national championship.\nUtah's 1998 NCAA Tournament run capped one of the greatest seasons in Utah basketball history, and cemented the Utes standing on the national stage in the 1990s — where they were one of the nation's winningest programs.\nRick Majerus career would come to an end only a few years after that run. After guiding Utah to 3 more conference championships and 4 NCAA Tournament berths (1999, 2000, 2002, and 2003) which included another loss to Kentucky (the 2003 NCAA second round). Majerus retired from Utah, citing health concerns. He left the Utes with a 323–95 record, including 4 Sweet 16s, 2 Elite Eights and 1 Final Four.\nPost-Majerus struggles.\nAfter Kerry Rupp led the Utes to the NCAA tournament to finish out the remainder of Rick Majerus' season in 2004, Utah had to look for a coach for the first time in 15 years. After being turned down by Nevada head coach Trent Johnson, the Utes settled on Eastern Washington head coach Ray Giacoletti. An unknown from the Northwest, many fans were left wondering whether the hire would prove to be successful or not. And at first, it appeared it would be, as in his first season with the Utes, Giacoletti led them to a 29–6 record, a dominant 13–1 conference finish and a Sweet 16 appearance, the school's first since the amazing run in 1998. And, like in 1998, Utah would lose to their tournament nemesis, Kentucky. Utah finished the season ranked No. 14 in the nation; Andrew Bogut won the Naismith and Wooden Awards and was taken No. 1 overall in the 2005 NBA draft. Yet that success ultimately did Giacoletti in, as the Utes lost too much from that season and failed to finish above .500 in consecutive years for the first time since the 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons.\nOn March 3, 2007, Giacoletti resigned as Utah's head coach effective after the season. The resignation came a day before Utah was to play rival BYU, a game they were blown out in. Giacoletti finished his career at Utah with an 80–54 loss to UNLV in the first round of the Mountain West Conference tournament. Giacoletti was 54–40 at Utah, with one conference championship and a 2–1 NCAA Tournament record.\nThe Boylen slump.\nOn March 26, 2007, it was announced that Jim Boylen would succeed Ray Giacoletti. Boylen, an assistant under Tom Izzo, came to Utah after spending over 20 years as an assistant at the collegiate and pro level. His 13 years in the NBA as an assistant with the Houston Rockets, Golden State Warriors and Milwaukee Bucks appeared to have been an asset for a Utah program known for getting successful players into the NBA.\nJim Boylen went 18–15 in his first year at Utah, guiding the Utes to their first postseason tournament in 3 years, as they made the inaugural College Basketball Invitational, where they advanced to the second round before losing to the Tulsa Golden Hurricane.\nThey also won the 2009 Mountain West Conference men's basketball tournament in a close 52–50 victory over San Diego State Aztecs. Utah entered the NCAA tournament as a number 5 seed. The Utes would then be upset by the 12 seed Arizona Wildcats 84–71 in the first round.\nOn March 12, 2011, the University of Utah fired Jim Boylen after consecutive losing seasons.\nKrystkowiak leads the Utes into the Pac-12.\nOn April 3, 2011, the University of Utah announced Larry Krystkowiak would take over the head coaching position as the Utes transition in the inaugural season of the newly expanded Pac-12. Krystkowiak, who is a former NBA player and coach, in his previous NCAA head coaching position, he spent two seasons with his alma mater of Montana (2004–06), leading the Grizzlies to Big Sky Conference tournament wins and NCAA tournament appearances in both seasons. In 2006 the Grizzlies beat a heavily favored Nevada team for Krystkowiak's only NCAA tournament victory as a head coach, before joining the Utes.\nOverall, Krystkowiak had compiled a record of 42–20 as an NCAA Division I head coach before moving on to coach with the Milwaukee Bucks and New Jersey Nets.\nKrystkowiak took charge of a depleted Utah roster which lost 8 players in the wake of his hiring. In their first season under Krystokwiak's charge, the 2011–2012 Utes would struggle to a 6–25 record including a 3–15 mark against Pac-12 opponents. This season saw the dismissal of star player Josh \"Jiggy\" Watkins. The 2011–2012 Utes were led in scoring by Jason Washburn and Chris Hines.\nAfter what would go down as one of the worst seasons in Utah Basketball history, Krystkowiak and his staff got to work installing their own system. The 2012 recruiting class saw Utah sign players who would become major parts of the system in 6'5\" SF/SG Dakrai Tucker, 5'9\" PG Brandon Taylor, 6'11 C Dallin Bachynski, and a host of other signings. The biggest of these signings, though, would prove to be the highly touted West Jordan High School product Jordan Loveridge. Having received offers from multiple programs nationally, Loveridge skipped the likes of BYU, Colorado, and Utah State for the Utes. At the time of his signing, Loveridge was ranked 12th in ESPNU's list of the top 50 recruits in the West for the 2012 graduating class.\nThe Rebuild.\nLed by strong leadership from senior center Jason Washburn and major contributions from Loyola Marymount transfer shooting guard Jarred DuBois and the new freshmen, the 2012–2013 Utah Runnin' Utes put together a 15–18 season which included a run to the Pac-12 Tournament semifinal. The Utes fortunes' continued to grow as news of a recruiting class which included NBA swingman Dorell Wright's brother, junior college point guard Delon Wright, meshed with a loss of only 3 players who saw considerable minutes.\nThe 2013–2014 season marked a medial return to form for the Runnin' Utes as the team put up a 21–12 record, including a 9–9 mark in Pac-12 play. With new guard Delon Wright and Sophomore guard Brandon Taylor often starting together in the backcourt and Jordan Loveridge staying in his starting small forward position, the Utes saw a jump in scoring from 64.2 PTS/G to a much more potent 75.1 PTS/G. This year also saw the Utes beat their rival Brigham Young University Cougars for the first time in seven tries in a game where the homegrown Jordan Loveridge would score a game high 21 points to go with his 6 rebounds and 5 assists. After the game, Loveridge would declare \"it just shows that Utah basketball is back. We're heading in the right direction every day and we're only going to go up from here\". The season culminated in Utah's first postseason action in many seasons, where Utah lost to Saint Mary's College in the NIT, 70–58. This season's recruiting class included a pair of four star recruits in Brekkott Chapman and Kyle Kuzma, both forwards, but the jewel of the class turned out to be the Austrian seven-footer Jakob Poeltl. As the season drew nearer, optimism surrounded the Utes, with some outlets predicting a run to the NCAA tournament.\nThe Runnin' Utes stormed out of the gates in the 2014–2015 season, amassing a 14–2 record in their first 16 games with losses to #16 San Diego State and #10 Kansas. Wins included a repeat victory against BYU and an overtime thriller against #8 Wichita State. The season would end in a Sweet Sixteen trip for the Runnin' Utes where they lost to the eventual champion Duke Blue Devils by a score of 63–57. The Utes' defense improved to allow only 57.1 points a game in contrast to the previous year's 64.3 as the passing lanes were consistently clogged by Senior Delon Wright and Junior Brandon Taylor who combined to average 3.4 steals a game to go with their combined scoring output of 25.1 points a game. Freshman Jakob Poeltl proved himself to be a major part of the defensive resurgence, averaging nearly 2 blocks a game to go with his 9 points and nearly 7 rebound average. Junior Jordan Loveridge improved upon his high shooting percentage to shoot 43% from three-point range, and the rest of the team joined in, putting up the 7th best 3-point shooting percentage in the nation.\nIndividual honors.\nNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nThe following Runnin' Utes have been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame:\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Utes have appeared in 29 NCAA tournaments.

        "title": "1877 Wimbledon Championship",
        "text": "The 1877 Wimbledon Championship was a men's tennis tournament held at the All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club (AEC &amp; LTC) in Wimbledon, London. It was the world's first official lawn tennis tournament, and was later recognised as the first Grand Slam tournament or \"Major\". The AEC &amp; LTC had been founded in July 1868, as the All England Croquet Club. Lawn tennis was introduced in February 1875 to compensate for the waning interest in croquet. In June 1877 the club decided to organise a tennis tournament to pay for the repair of its pony roller, needed to maintain the lawns. A set of rules was drawn up for the tournament, derived from the first standardised rules of tennis issued by the Marylebone Cricket Club in May 1875.\nThe Gentlemen's Singles competition, the only event of the championship, was contested on grass courts by 22 players who each paid one guinea to participate. The tournament started on 9 July 1877, and the final – delayed for three days by rain – was played on 19 July in front of a crowd of about 200 people who each paid an entry fee of one shilling. The winner received 12 guineas in prize money and a silver challenge cup, valued at 25 guineas, donated by the sports magazine \"The Field\". Spencer Gore, a 27-year-old rackets player from Wandsworth, became the first Wimbledon champion by defeating William Marshall, a 28-year-old real tennis player, in three straight sets in a final that lasted 48 minutes. The tournament made a profit of £10. An analysis made after the tournament led to some modifications of the rules regarding the court dimensions.\nBackground.\nOrigins of lawn tennis.\nThe origin of tennis lies in the monastic cloisters in 12th-century France, where the ball was struck with the palm of the hand in a game called \"jeu de paume\". Rackets were introduced to the game in the early 16th century. This original version of tennis, now called \"real tennis\", was mostly played indoors and popular among the royalty and gentry, while a crude outdoor version called \"longue paume\" was played by the populace. The prominence of the game declined in the 17th and 18th centuries, although there are sporadic mentions of a \"long tennis\" or \"field tennis\" version in the second half of the 18th century.\nBetween 1858 and 1873 several people in Victorian England experimented with a lawn version of tennis. Major Harry Gem and Augurio Perera demonstrated their game of \"Pelota\" (Spanish for \"ball\") and in 1872 created the world's first lawn tennis club at Leamington Spa. In February 1874 Major Clopton Wingfield introduced his version of lawn tennis, called \"Sphairistikè\"; on his patent application, he described it as a \"New and Improved Court for Playing the Ancient Game of Tennis\", and its rules were published in an eight-page booklet. Wingfield is widely credited with popularising the new game through his energetic promotional efforts. The \"Sphairistikè\" court was hourglass-shaped, wider at the baseline than at the net. The service was made from a single side in a lozenge shaped box situated in the middle of the court and it had to bounce beyond the service line. In November 1874 Wingfield published a second, expanded edition of \"The Book of the Game\", which had 12 rules and featured a larger court and a slightly lower net.\nAll England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club.\nThe All England Croquet Club was founded on 23 July 1868 by six gentlemen at the offices of \"The Field\", a weekly country and sports magazine. After a year-long search a suitable ground of four acres of meadowland was located between the London and South Western Railway and Worple Road in Wimbledon, then an outer suburb of London. The club's committee decided on 24 September 1869 to lease the ground and paid £50 rental for the first year, a fee which increased to £75 and £100, respectively, over the following two years. The increasing rent, coupled with a waning interest in the sedate sport of croquet, was causing the club financial difficulties. In February 1875 it decided to introduce lawn tennis at its grounds to capitalise on the growing interest in this new sport and generate additional revenue. The proposal was made by Henry Jones, a sports writer who published extensively in \"The Field\" under his nom de plume \"Cavendish\" and who had joined the club in 1869. The introduction of lawn tennis was approved at the annual meeting and the club's membership fee was set at two guineas to cover both sports. At a cost of £25, one croquet lawn was converted to a tennis court. Soon after its completion on 25 February 1875, a dozen new club members joined. In 1876 four more lawns, a third of the ground, were handed over to lawn tennis to address the increase in new members. A committee member, George Nicol, was appointed to deal exclusively with lawn tennis affairs. Lawn tennis had become so popular that on 14 April 1877 the name of the club was formally changed, at the suggestion of founding member John H. Hale, to the All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club (AEC&amp;LTC).\nRules of lawn tennis.\nOn 3 March 1875 the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), in its capacity as the governing body for rackets and real tennis, convened a meeting at Lord's Cricket Ground to test the various versions of lawn tennis with the aim to fully standardise the game's rules. Wingfield was present to demonstrate \"Sphairistikè\", as was John H. Hale, who presented his version called Germains Lawn Tennis; there is no record of either Gem or Perera being present to showcase \"Pelota\". After the meeting, the MCC Tennis Committee was tasked with framing the rules. On 29 May 1875 the MCC issued the \"Laws of Lawn Tennis\", the first unified rules for lawn tennis, which were adopted by the club on 24 June. These were significantly based on the rules introduced by Wingfield in February 1874 and published in his rule-booklet titled \"Sphairistikè or Lawn Tennis\". The MCC adopted Wingfield's hourglass-shaped court as well as the rackets method of scoring, in which the player who first scores 15 points wins the game and only the server (\"hand-in\") was able to score. The height of the net was set at 5 ft (1.52 m) at the posts and 4 ft (1.22 m) in the centre. Various aspects of these rules, including the characteristic court shape and the method of scoring, were the subject of prolonged debate in the press. The MCC rules were not universally adhered to following its publication and, among others, the \"Prince's Club\" in London stuck to playing on rectangular courts.\nTournament.\nOn 2 June 1877, at the suggestion of the All England Club secretary and founding member John H. Walsh, the club committee decided to organise a lawn tennis championship for amateurs, a Gentlemen's Singles event, which they hoped would generate enough funds to repair the broken pony roller that was needed for the maintenance of the lawns. This championship became the world's first official lawn tennis tournament, and the first edition of what would later be called a Grand Slam tournament (or \"Major\"). The committee agreed to hold the tournament on the condition that it would not endanger the club's limited funds; to ensure this, Henry Jones persuaded 20 members and friends of the club to guarantee a part of the tournament's financial requirement and made himself responsible for the remaining amount. Jones investigated all potential tournament locations in and around London but came to the conclusion that no other ground was more suitable than the Wimbledon premises at Worple Road. As a consequence, the remaining croquet lawns were converted to tennis courts.\nAnnouncement.\nThe first public announcement of the tournament was published on 9 June 1877 in \"The Field\" magazine under the header \"Lawn Tennis Championship\":\nThe All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club, Wimbledon, propose to hold a lawn tennis meeting, open to all amateurs, on Monday, July 9th and following days. Entrance fee, £1 1\"s\" 0\"d\". Names and addresses of competitors to be forwarded to the Hon. Sec. A.E.C. and L.T.C. before Saturday, July 7, or on that day before 2.15 p.m. at the club ground, Wimbledon. Two prizes will be given – one gold champion prize to the winner, one silver to the second player. The value of the prizes will depend on the number of entries, and will be declared before the draw; but in no case will they be less than the amount of the entrance money, and if there are ten and less than sixteen entries, they will be made up to £10 10\"s\" and £5 5\"s\" respectively.– Henry Jones – Hon Sec of the Lawn Tennis sub-committee\nPlayers were instructed to provide their own racquets and wear shoes without heels. The announcement also stated that a programme would be available shortly with further details, including the rules to be adopted for the meeting. Invitations were sent to prospective participants. Potential visitors were informed that those arriving by horse and carriage should use the entrance at Worple Road while those who planned to come by foot were advised to use the railway path. Upon payment of the entrance fee, the participants were allowed to practise before the Championship on the twelve available courts with the provision that on Saturdays and during the croquet championship week, held the week before the tennis tournament, the croquet players had the first choice of courts. Practice balls, similar to the ones used for the tournament, were available from the club's gardener at a price of 12s per dozen balls. John H. Walsh, in his capacity as editor of \"The Field\", persuaded his employer to donate a cup worth 25 guineas for the winner; the \"Field Cup\". The cup was made of sterling silver and had the inscription: \"The All England Lawn Tennis Challenge Cup – Presented by the Proprietors of The Field – For competition by Amateurs – Wimbledon July, 1877\". On 6 July 1877, three days prior to the start of the tournament, a notice was published in \"The Times\":\nNext week at the All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club Ground a Lawn Tennis Championship Meeting will be held. The ground is situated close to the Wimbledon Station on the South Western Railway, and is sufficiently large for the erection of thirty \"courts\". On each day the competition will begin at 3.30, the first ties, of course, beginning on Monday. The Hon. Sec. of the meeting is Mr. J.H. Walsh, while Mr. H. Jones will officiate as referee. The entries are numerous.\nRules.\nThe committee of the club was not satisfied with certain aspects of the 1875 MCC unified rules. To address these perceived shortcomings, a sub-committee consisting of Charles Gilbert Heathcote, Julian Marshall and Henry Jones was set up on 2 June 1877, to establish the rules applicable for the upcoming tournament. They reported back on 7 June with a new set of rules, derived but significantly different from those published by the MCC; in order not to offend the MCC, these rules were declared \"provisional\" and valid only for the championship:\nThese rules, drawn up by the club for this initial tournament, were eventually adopted for the entire sport and, with only slight modifications, have retained their validity. All matches during the tournament were played as best-of-five sets.\nPlay.\nIn accordance with the All England Regulations for the Management of Prize Meetings, the draw for the 22 entrants was made on Saturday, 7 July 1877, at 3:30p.m. in the club's pavilion. H.T. Gillson had the distinction of being the first player in the history of modern tennis to be drawn for a tournament. The posts, nets and hand-stitched, flannel-covered India-rubber balls for the tournament were supplied by Jefferies &amp; Co from Woolwich, while the rackets used were an adaptation of those used in real tennis, with a small and slightly lopsided head. The ball-boys kept the tennis balls, 180 of which were used during the tournament, in canvas wells. The umpires who were provided for the matches sat on chairs which in turn were placed on small tables of 18 inches height to give them a better view of the court.\nThe tournament began on Monday, 9 July 1877, at 3:30p.m. and daily programmes were available for sixpence. On the first day, in sunny weather, ten matches were played, which completed the first round. Full match scores were published on the notice board inside the pavilion. F.N. Langham, a Cambridge tennis blue, was given a walkover in the first round when C.F. Buller, an Etonian and well-known rackets player, did not appear. Julian Marshall became the first player to win a five-set match when he fought back from being two sets down against Captain Grimston. Spencer Gore, a 27-year-old rackets player from Wandsworth and at the time a land agent and surveyor by profession, won his first round match against Henry Thomas Gillson in straight sets. The five second-round matches were played on Tuesday, 10 July, again in fine weather. Charles Gilbert Heathcote had a bye in the second round. J. Lambert became the first player in Wimbledon Championships' history to retire a match, conceding to L.R. Erskine after losing the first two sets. Julian Marshall again won a five-set match, this time against F.W. Oliver, while Gore defeated Montague Hankey in four sets.\nThe quarter-finals were played on Wednesday, 11 July, before a larger number of spectators than had attended the previous matches. Start of play was delayed from the scheduled 3:30p.m. due to strong winds. Gore defeated Langham in four sets, William Marshall beat Erskine, also in four sets, and Julian Marshall, who injured his knee during the match after a fall, lost to Heathcote in straight sets. The quarter-final matches left three players, instead of four, in the draw for the semi-finals scheduled for Thursday. To solve the situation lots were drawn and Marshall, a 28-year-old architect and Cambridge real tennis blue, was given a bye to the final. His opponent would be Gore, who defeated Heathcote in straight sets in the only semi-final played. When the semi-final stage had concluded on Thursday, 12 July, play was suspended until next Monday, 16 July, to avoid a clash with the popular annual Eton v Harrow cricket match that was played at Lord's on Friday and Saturday.\nThe final was postponed from its scheduled start on Monday at 4p.m. until Thursday, 19 July, at 3:30p.m. because of rain. On Thursday it was still showery, causing the final to be further delayed by an hour. It began on a dead and slippery court in front of about 200 spectators. There was a temporary three-plank stand on one side of the court offering seating to about thirty people. Marshall won the toss, elected to serve first and was immediately broken by Gore. After the first set was won by Gore, it started to rain for a quarter of an hour; this further softened the ground and affected the quality of play. The final lasted 48 minutes, and Spencer Gore won the inaugural championship against William Marshall in three straight sets of 15, 13, and 20 minutes respectively. En route to the title Gore had won 15 sets and lost two and won 99 games for the loss of 46. Gore, the volley specialist, had beaten the baseline player, at a time when volleying was considered by some to be unsporting. Some tried to outlaw the volley and a discussion on its merits took place in \"The Field\" for weeks after the tournament.\nThe final was followed by a play-off match for 2nd place between Marshall and Heathcote. The players could not fix another date for the match and decided to play it straight away. By agreement, the match was limited to best-of-three sets. Marshall, playing his second match of the day, defeated Heathcote in straight sets, in front of a diminished crowd, and won the silver prize of seven guineas.\nAftermath.\nOn 20 July 1877, the day following the final, a report was published in \"The Morning Post\" newspaper:\nLawn Tennis Championship – A fair number of spectators assembled yesterday, notwithstanding the rain, on the beautifully kept ground of the All England Club, Wimbledon, to witness the final contest between Messrs. Spencer Gore and W. Marshall for the championship. The play on both sides was of the highest order and its exhibition afforded a great treat to lovers of the game. All three sets were won buy Mr. Gore, who, therefore, becomes lawn tennis champion for 1877, and wins the £12 12s. gold prize and holds the silver challenge cup, value £25 5s. The second and third prizes were then played for by Messrs. W. Marshall and G.C. Heathcote (best of three sets by agreement). Mr. Marshall won two sets to love, and therefore takes the silver prize (value £12 12s.). Mr. Heathcote takes the third prize, value £3 3s.\nA report in \"The Field\" stated: \"The result was a more easy victory for Mr Spencer Gore than had been expected.\". Third-placed Heathcote said that Gore was the best player of the year and had a varied service with a lot of twist on it. Gore, according to Heathcote, was a player with an aptitude for many games and had a long reach and a strong and flexible wrist. His volleying style was novel at the time, a forceful shot instead of merely a pat back over the net. All the opponents who were defeated by Gore on his way to the title were real tennis players. His victory was therefore regarded as a win of the rackets style of play over the real tennis style, and of the offensive style of the volley player – who comes to the net to force the point, over the baseline player – who plays groundstrokes from the back of the court, intent on keeping the ball in play. His volleying game was also successful because the height of the net at the post – 5 ft (1.52 m) in contrast to the modern height of 3 ft 6 in (1.07 m) – made it difficult for his opponents to pass him by driving the ball down the line. Gore indicated that the real tennis players had the tendency to play shots from corner to corner over the middle of the net and did so at such a height that made volleying easy.\nDespite his historic championship title, Gore was not enthusiastic about the new sport of lawn tennis. In 1890, thirteen years after winning his championship title, he wrote: \"... it is want of variety that will prevent lawn tennis in its present form from taking rank among our great games ... That anyone who has really played well at cricket, tennis, or even rackets, will ever seriously give his attention to lawn tennis, beyond showing himself to be a promising player, is extremely doubtful; for in all probability the monotony of the game as compared with others would choke him off before he had time to excel in it.\" He did return for the 1878 Championship to defend his title in the Challenge Round but lost in straight sets to Frank Hadow, a coffee planter from Ceylon, who effectively used the lob to counter Gore's net play. It was Gore's last appearance at the Wimbledon Championships.\nAnalysis and rules changes.\nThe tournament generated a profit of £10 and the pony roller stayed in use. When the tournament was finished, Henry Jones gathered all the score cards to analyse the results and found that, of the 601 games played during the tournament, 376 were won by the server (\"striker-in\") and 225 by the receiver (\"striker-out\"). At a time when the service was either made underarm or, usually, at shoulder height, this was seen as a serving dominance and resulted in a modification of the rules for the 1878 Championship. To decrease the target area for the server, the length of the service court was reduced from 26 to 22 ft (7.92 to 6.71 m) and to make passing shots easier against volleyers the height of the net was reduced to 4 ft 9 in (1.45 m) at the posts and 3 feet (0.91 m) at the centre. These rules were published jointly by the AEC &amp; LTC and the MCC, giving the AEC &amp; LTC an official rule-making authority and in effect retroactively sanctioning its 1877 rules. It marked the moment when the AEC &amp; LTC effectively usurped the rule-making initiative from the MCC although the latter would still ratify rule changes until 1882. In recognition of the importance and popularity of lawn tennis, the club was renamed in 1882 to All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC).\nCommemorative plaque.\nOn 18 June 2012 a commemorative plaque was unveiled at the former home of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, in Worple Road, Wimbledon celebrating both the first Wimbledon Championships and the 1908 Olympic tennis event. The ceremony was performed by Heather Hanbury, Headmistress of Wimbledon High School; Philip Brook, Chairman of the All England Club, and Cr David T Williams JP, Mayor of Merton.\nGentlemen's singles.\nFinal.\n Spencer Gore defeated William Marshall, 6–1, 6–2, 6–4\nSecond place match.\n William Marshall defeated Charles Gilbert Heathcote 6–4, 6–4 \nNotes and references.\nNotes\nReferences\nSources"

It was also the Wimbledon’s 50th anniversary of the staging of the Wimbledon Tennis Championships.\nThis was the first Wimbledon Championships where the draw used a merit-based seeding of ranked players to prevent the top players from meeting each other in the early rounds. Eight players were seeded in both the men's and women's singles and four pairs in the double. The seeding was done according to the ranking of the players in their own countries. René Lacoste and Helen Wills were the first no.1 seeded singles players. Since the 1924 Championships a seeding based on nationality was used to prevent nominated players from the same nationality to meet before the later rounds.\nAnother innovation that year was the installation of a microphone and loudspeakers on Centre Court to broadcast the calls of the umpire. A special footfault judge was introduced for the centre court and court no.1. The BBC first began radio broadcast of the tournament this year, with the first radio broadcast taking place on 29 June and diffused on 2LO.

        "text": "The men's individual road race at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia, was held on Friday 7 December 1956. There were 88 participants from 28 nations. Of the 88 starters 44 rode the distance to the end. The event was won by Ercole Baldini of Italy, the nation's first medal in the men's individual road race. Arnaud Geyre took silver, France's first medal since back-to-back golds in 1936 and 1948. Alan Jackson's bronze was Great Britain's first medal in the event since 1896.\nFrench and British officials protested against Baldini's victory, claiming that he was protected from the hot sun by the Olympic film unit van that drove alongside him, but the protest was upheld. The start of the race was delayed fifteen minutes when it was discovered that two 'unauthorised' Irish cyclists, Tom Gerrard and Paudie Fitzgerald were in the starting field. The two were removed and then \"joined 200 supporters in passing out Irish nationalist literature.\"\nEach nation could enter up to four cyclists; nations entering at least three cyclists had the scores of their best three finishers used for the team road race event.\nBackground.\nThis was the fifth appearance of the event, previously held in 1896 and then at every Summer Olympics since 1936. It replaced the individual time trial event that had been held from 1912 to 1932 (and which would be reintroduced alongside the road race in 1996). Ercole Baldini was a \"heavy favorite\" after setting an amateur world record in the one-hour ride and winning the 1956 individual pursuit world championship.\nColombia, Ethiopia, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela each made their debut in the men's individual road race; East and West Germany competed as the United Team of Germany. Great Britain made its fifth appearance in the event, the only nation to have competed in each appearance to date.\nCompetition format and course.\nThe mass-start race was on a course that covered 11 laps of a 17.0665 kilometres circuit, for a total of 187.73 kilometres. The course was \"a fairly hilly ride\" with \"two large climbs that both peaked at 12% grades, the second of which [was] over a full kilometre.\"\nSchedule.\nThe day started mild, but it became \"rather warm\" during the afternoon.\nResults.\nThe race started \"rather quiet,\" with pressure picking up from lap 3 to lap 5. Many riders fell behind in the heat during that stretch. Feeding was allowed in lap 5. There were not many falls during this race, but the most serious happened then, with a bag tangling in Trickey's wheel and resulting in a crash that eliminated him and Mengistou. Baldini separated from the pack in lap 8, with 50 kilometres left, and was not challenged the rest of the way as he only increased his lead. A pack of four riders competed for second through fifth places."

        "text": "The Super Eight stage of the 2007 Cricket World Cup was scheduled between 27 March 2007 and 21 April 2007, and determined the four qualifiers for the semi-finals of the tournament. Matches were held in Antigua, Bridgetown, Barbados, Georgetown, and Grenada.\nEach team carried forward the result from the other team qualifying from its group in the group stage of the tournament, so the Super Eight was essentially an eight-team round robin competition. Two points were awarded for a win and one for a tie or a no result. If teams were tied on points, the team with the most wins was ranked ahead, and if this is also equal net run rate determined the ranking order.\nTable.\nThe four top teams, depicted with green backgrounds in the table below, qualified for the semi-finals.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nTeams.\nEight teams qualified from the group stage. India and Pakistan, ranked fifth and fourth in the ICC ODI Championship before the tournament began, were eliminated by Bangladesh and Ireland respectively. The other six seeded teams proceeded, with Australia beating the number one ranked team in the One Day International championship, South Africa. New Zealand, Sri Lanka and West Indies also carried one win forward from the group stage.\nICC ODI Championship rankings.\nThese were the rankings as of 12 March, before the group stage began.\n\"Note:Ireland did not have an official ODI ranking; they were ranked in this tournament based on their win percentage against associate members and then wins against full members.\"\nMatches.\nAustralia vs West Indies.\nAustralia were put in to bat by Brian Lara as the ball moved about and deviated off the seam in the early overs. Daren Powell got the wicket of Adam Gilchrist with an inside edge, while Matthew Hayden could not score off his first 17 deliveries – then made 158 runs from the next 126 to make the highest innings for Australia in a World Cup match. However, Ricky Ponting and Hayden scored at above six an over in their partnership, before Ponting was eventually run out. Hayden added 98 for the third wicket with Michael Clarke before Dwayne Bravo broke through, and Andrew Symonds and Michael Hussey could not provide more than 15 runs to the team cause. Hussey got out the total at 234 for five in the 41st over, but Hayden eventually led Australia to break loose in the last 10 overs, taking 99 from them despite a 20-minute break for rain. Shane Watson's 33 from 26 balls also helped push Australia to 322 for 6 after the full 50 overs. This was the sixth successive score above 300 for Australia, a new One Day International record.\nDrizzle and wet ground conditions delayed the start of West Indies' reply and the game was eventually abandoned to resume the following day. They lost three wickets in the first 20 overs, and though Brian Lara and Denesh Ramdin contributed fifties, they required 105 to win off 28 balls when Daren Powell was bowled by Shaun Tait. Earlier, Glenn McGrath had removed Chris Gayle, Marlon Samuels and Dwayne Bravo for single-figure scores, thus moving within one wicket of Wasim Akram's World Cup record.\nThis was the first international match at the new Sir Vivian Richards Stadium. The stadium was barely half-filled for the game, causing criticism from notables such as West Indies' captain Brian Lara and commentator Mark Nicholas.\nSri Lanka vs South Africa.\nSri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat, and lost their first five wickets for 98, with Charl Langeveldt taking two in his first spell. Tillakaratne Dilshan and Russel Arnold built a sixth-wicket stand of 97 in nearly 20 overs, but Dilshan was caught off Makhaya Ntini's bowling, and then Charl Langeveldt took three wickets in five balls as Sri Lanka were bowled out in the final over for 209. In reply, Chaminda Vaas had AB de Villiers bowled in the first over, but Jacques Kallis added 95 with Graeme Smith and 65 with Herschelle Gibbs, leading South Africa to within four runs of victory with his 86. Then Sri Lanka's Lasith Malinga struck. He became the first bowler to take four wickets with four consecutive deliveries in international cricket, though South Africa managed a run off Vaas in the intermediate over. South Africa now needed three runs to win with one wicket in hand, and eleven deliveries went by before Robin Peterson got an outside edge to a Malinga ball, which went out of reach of slip and went fine for four.\nEngland vs Ireland.\nEngland won the toss and batted first, but lost both openers to Boyd Rankin in six overs, before Ian Bell spent 74 balls making his 31. When Bell got out, the run rate was slightly above 4; in the final 28 overs it was in excess of 6, with Paul Collingwood making 90, Kevin Pietersen 48 and Andrew Flintoff 43. Kyle McCallan was the most economical bowler for Ireland, and also took the wicket of Pietersen.\nChasing 267 in reply, Niall O'Brien's third One Day International fifty and his second of the World Cup helped Ireland to a total of 139 for six in the 37th over, but despite faster than a run a ball scores from Trent Johnston and Andrew White Ireland fell 48 runs short as Andrew Flintoff took the final two wickets, though they exceeded their previous World Cup record total by seven runs.\nBangladesh vs Australia.\nGlenn McGrath's three wickets took his tally for the tournament to 56.\nSri Lanka vs West Indies.\nThe start of the match was delayed due to bad weather, but a full 50-over match was played, which resulted in West Indies' third defeat in four days. Sanath Jayasuriya and Mahela Jayawardene added 183 for the third wicket, before Tillakaratne Dilshan came in and took 39 off 22 deliveries as the final eleven overs yielded 84 runs. In reply, West Indies needed 170 off 94 when Ramnaresh Sarwan was stumped off Sanath Jayasuriya; they only got 56 of those, and were bowled out for 190, with four batsmen out in single figures.\nSri Lanka vs England.\nSri Lanka batted first and made 235, bowled out off the last ball with a run out. England lost their openers for 0 and 10, but Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen made a stand of 90 for the third wicket, and Paul Collingwood joined Pietersen to add a further 25 before Pietersen was caught and bowled by Muttiah Muralitharan. England then lost two more wickets for seven runs to Dilhara Fernando, and required 103 off 16.3 overs with four wickets in hand. However, Ravi Bopara scored a half-century in his fourth One Day International innings, as he and Paul Nixon took England within three runs of victory. However, Fernando returned for the last over, and bowled Bopara off the last ball.\nNew Zealand vs Sri Lanka.\nDespite missing top bowler Lasith Malinga due to injury, Sri Lanka won comfortably against New Zealand.\nIreland vs Australia.\nAustralia's win confirmed their place in the top four. Ireland could not now qualify for the semi-finals.\nSouth Africa vs New Zealand.\nThis win by New Zealand meant that they had qualified for the semi-finals. It also confirmed Sri Lanka's place in the top four, as only one other team below them could equal Sri Lanka's 8 points.\nIreland vs Bangladesh.\nIreland's total of 243/7 was their highest in World Cup matches. Bangladesh's loss meant that they could no longer qualify for the semi-finals.\nSri Lanka vs Australia.\nAustralia were now guaranteed either first or second place in the Super 8s, and Sri Lanka could no longer get first place.\nEngland vs South Africa.\nThis result confirmed that South Africa had clinched one of the four semi-final places, and that England and the West Indies were unable to progress.\nAustralia vs New Zealand.\nAustralia secured top place on the Super 8 table and a semi-final match-up with South Africa."

The Challenge Cup is the most prestigious knock-out competition in the world of rugby league, featuring teams from across Europe including England, Scotland, Wales, France and Russia.\nIn 2007 the preliminary round was dropped, reducing the number of amateur clubs involved. Teams from the National League were given byes to round three, and teams from the Super League entered in round four. Teams from outside the UK were introduced at various stages.\nSt. Helens successfully defended their title after beating Catalans Dragons (who were the first French club ever to take part in the competition's final) 30 – 8 in the final at the new Wembley Stadium on 26 August.\nRound 1.\nTeams came from the National Conference League, Rugby League Conference, Student Rugby League, Pennine League, North West Counties, Yorkshire League, CARLA, Hull &amp; District League and the Armed Forces.

        "title": "Key (basketball)",
        "text": "The key, officially referred to as the free throw lane by the National Basketball Association (NBA) (and Euroleague), the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), and the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS), and the restricted area by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA), is a marked area on a basketball court surrounding the basket, where much of the game's action takes place. \nIt resembles a locksmith's key and consists of what is colloquially known as the circle and the post, also known as the lane or the paint, overlapping at the bottom half of the circle. It can be considered a lane showing the path to the basket, and is usually painted in a distinctive color. The post is bounded by the baseline, the free-throw line, and two lane lines connecting free throw line and baseline. \nDimensions of the key area have varied through the history of the game. The lane used to be only 6 feet wide, better resembling the keyhole of a warded lock. In the NBA, the success near the basket of tall center George Mikan led to widening the lane to 12 feet, and similarly Wilt Chamberlain led to the widening of the lane to 16 feet. Since the 2010 FIBA rule amendments (implemented following the 2010 FIBA World Championship), its shape is rectangular for games sanctioned by all three associations, wide for both NBA and FIBA keys, and for NCAA and NAIA keys. Prior to 2006, the key in FIBA-sanctioned tournaments was a trapezoidal shape.\nThe most-commonly enforced rule on the key is the \"three seconds rule\" in which the team of a player on offense who stays on the key for more than three seconds loses possession of the ball. Another rule is the lane violation which occurs if a player from either team enters the key before a free-throw shooter releases the ball in the act of shooting, with the penalty of no basket if the shooter's team stepped over, and a penalty of a redo if the opposing team stepped over. A recent innovation is the introduction of the restricted area arc directly underneath the basket where the defending player cannot force an offensive foul on the opposing player.\nDimensions.\nEach level of play has different specifications for the size and shape of the key: in American leagues, where the basketball court is measured in US units, the shape is rectangular, while in FIBA-sanctioned events, which use the metric system, the shape was trapezoidal before being changed to a rectangle as well. In addition to the bounding rectangle, the key includes a free-throw circle at its head or top.\nThe width of the key in the NBA is ; in U.S. college (NCAA, NAIA, etc.) and high school (NFHS) play, it is 12 feet (3.7 m).\nBeginning after the 2010 FIBA World Championship, all FIBA-administered tournaments use a rectangular key wide. From 1956 until 2010, FIBA-sanctioned tournaments used a trapezoidal key. The narrower end was on the free-throw line, where it was , while the wider end, at the end line, measured .\nThe free throw circle has a radius centered at the midpoint of the free throw line. The half-circle on the mid-court side of the free throw line is painted solid. In the NBA and Euroleague Basketball competitions, the boundary of the half closer to the basket is traced in a broken line in order to space players properly for jump balls. NBA Rule 1 (g) requires the key to contain two long hash marks, from the free throw line; the marks indicate the so-called lower defensive box. The free throw line is from the perpendicular projection of the face of the backboard onto the court; this projection is from the end line for NBA, NCAA/NAIA, and NFHS. The projection of the center of the basket onto the court is a perpendicular distance of from the end line in FIBA tournaments, but in NBA and NCAA or NAIA tournaments.\nHistory.\nOriginally, the key was narrower and was shaped more like a keyhole, measuring six feet (1.8 m) wide, hence its name \"the key\", with the free-throw circle as the head, and the shaded lane as the body. It has been also called \"cup\" or \"bottle\" in other languages, because of how it looks from other perspectives. Due to the narrow key, imposing centers, such as George Mikan, dominated the paint, scoring at will. To counter this, the key was widened into 12 feet (3.7 m) from at the onset of the 1951–52 NBA season.\nMen's professional basketball in the United States (the National Basketball Association) widened it further to 16 feet (4.9 m) in the 1964–65 NBA season to reduce the effectiveness of dominant centers, especially Wilt Chamberlain. The NCAA and NAIA retain the 12‑foot key to this day.\nOn April 25, 2008, the FIBA Central Board approved rule changes that included the shape of the key. It is now rectangular and has virtually the same dimensions as the key used in the NBA. In addition, the no-charge semicircle formally called the restricted area arc was also created. The change took effect in 2010.\nRules.\nThree-second violation.\nThe lane is a restricted area in which players on offense (in possession of the ball) can stay for only three seconds. At all levels of play, after three seconds the player is assessed a \"three-second violation\" which results in a turnover.\nIn FIBA-sanctioned tournaments, defending team players are allowed to stay in the key with no time limit. In American professional basketball, defending team players are prohibited from staying in the key for more than three seconds, unless the player is directly guarding an offensive player. Otherwise if a defender exceeds that time, the defending team is charged with a \"defensive three-second violation\", which results in a technical foul where the team with the ball is awarded one free throw, plus retaining possession and a reset of the shot clock. In all cases, the clock resets if the shot hits the rim or if the player steps out of the lane.\nLane violation.\nWhen a player is shooting free throws, a certain number of players are allowed at the boundaries of the key, each occupying a slot traced at the boundaries of the key. The free throw shooter is behind the free throw line, and in most leagues three of his opponents are along the sides of the key, one side with two players, the other with one. Two of his opponents are situated nearest to the basket on both sides, while his two teammates are beside the two opponents closest to the basket, with the other player from the opposing team situated farthest from the basket. In the U.S. NCAA and NAIA, there are as many as six players along the key, with the opposing team allowed to have as many as four players, with the same arrangement as in the NBA and FIBA but with another player facing his teammate farthest to the basket. NFHS rules on this point are identical to NCAA/NAIA rules. \nNo player along the lane may enter the key until the shot is released. The player shooting the free throw, and anyone at top of the key, may not cross the free throw line until the ball hits the rim. If any of the offensive players violate the rule, no points are awarded for the shot and, if there are no more shots remaining, the ball is given to the defending team. If a defending player enters the lane too soon, an extra shot will be awarded regardless of whether the shot was made or missed.\nIn FIBA play, if the shooter commits the violation, it is an automatic turnover. If the shot is successful and the shooter does not commit a violation, but other players do commit a violation, all violations are dismissed. If players on the opposing team enter the key prior to the release of the ball, a jump ball determines who gets the possession of the ball (NBA) or the possession arrow rule (for all other levels). In FIBA play, that only applies if the shooter misses, since a successful attempt negates all other penalties. In all situations, lane violation penalties cannot occur if there are further free throws pending.\nRestricted area arc.\nIn the NBA, Euroleague, FIBA, NCAA, and NAIA play, the key has an arc extending four feet from the basket (NBA, NCAA, NAIA), or 1.25 meters (approximately 4.1 feet) (FIBA). The area behind the arc, or the arc itself, is called the \"restricted area\" (RA) in the NBA, the \"restricted area arc\" in the NCAA and NAIA, and the \"no-charge semicircles\" in FIBA. This arc is not used in NFHS play.\nIts purpose is to prevent secondary defenders from taking a position under the basket in an attempt to draw an offensive foul while a player is driving to the basket.\nIf a player on offense drives past his primary defender on the way to the basket and a secondary defender steps in, he must establish a position outside the RA to draw an offensive foul. \nIf the drive starts inside the Lower Defensive Box (LDB – the area from the bottom tip of the free throw circle to the end line between the two 3‑foot posted-up marks), the secondary defender is allowed to be positioned inside the RA. \nThe restricted area does not apply if the secondary defender jumps in attempting to block the shot, and the offensive player leads with his leg or knee in an unnatural motion or uses his off arm to prevent the defender from blocking his shot. \nThe RA does not extend from below the backboard to the baseline. Therefore, if a player drives the baseline and is not attempting to go directly to the rim, the RA does not apply.\nThe restricted area arc rule first appeared at any level of competition in the NBA for the 1997–98 season. It was applied in NCAA men's basketball for the 2010–2011 season. The NCAA approved adding a visible restricted-area arc three feet from the center of the basket in Division I men’s and women’s games for the 2011–2012 season. The panel delayed implementation of the arc until the 2012–2013 season for Divisions II and III to allow those schools more time to plan and place the restricted-area arc in their home arenas. Starting with the 2015–2016 season, the NCAA moved the RA arc out to four feet from the center of the basket; the NAIA followed suit.\nTerms.\nPoints made on the key are termed as \"points in the paint\" or \"inside points\". Historically, the area of the key where offensive players are prohibited from remaining longer than three seconds has been painted to distinguish the area from the rest of the court; hence the phrase \"points in the paint.\" \nThe area around the free throw circle's farthest point from the basket is called the \"top of the key\", or \"top of the circle\", and shots from this area in high school and college result in three points. Several plays also take place around the top of the key, such as screens and pick and rolls.\nThe intersection of the free throw line and the free throw lane is referred to as the \"elbow\" of the key.\nThe lane lines have marks separating where players stand during a free throw attempt. The one nearest the basketball is marked wider than the others, and is known as the \"block\"."

        "text": "Major League Baseball recognizes runs scored leaders in the American League and National League each season. In baseball, a run is scored when a player advances safely around first, second and third base and returns safely to home plate, touching the bases in that order, before three outs are recorded. A player may score by hitting a home run or by any combination of plays that puts him safely \"on base\" (that is, on first, second, or third) as a runner and subsequently brings him home. The object of the game is for a team to score more runs than its opponent.\nIn baseball statistics, a player who advances around all the bases to score is credited with a run (R), sometimes referred to as a \"run scored.\" While runs scored is considered an important individual batting statistic, it is regarded as less significant than runs batted in (RBIs)—superiority in the latter, for instance, is one of the elements of the exceptional batting achievement known as the Triple Crown. Both individual runs scored and runs batted in are heavily context-dependent; for a more sophisticated assessment of a player's contribution toward producing runs for his team, see runs created."

        "title": "Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball",
        "text": "The Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball team represents the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets in NCAA Division I basketball. The team plays its home games in McCamish Pavilion on the school's Atlanta campus and is currently coached by Damon Stoudamire. Bobby Cremins led his team to the first ACC tournament victory in school history in 1985 and in 1990 he took Georgia Tech to the school's first Final Four appearance ever. Cremins retired from Georgia Tech in 2000 with the school's best winning percentage as a head coach. The Yellow Jackets returned to the Final Four in 2004 under Paul Hewitt and lost in the national title game, losing to UConn. Overall, the team has won 1,352 games and lost 1,226 games, a .524 win percentage.\nHistory.\nGeorgia Tech's first recorded official participation in basketball was in 1906, when a small club organized under Coach Chapman. They won two of the three games they played that season. The next time Tech had a basketball team, it was under the famous coach John Heisman, also Tech's baseball and football coach. Heisman had a winning percentage of .142 that season and improved the team's percentage to .500 in 1912 and 1913.\nSince that time, Georgia Tech has forged a solid basketball program on the strength of coaches like John Hyder and Bobby Cremins, and such players as Roger Kaiser, Rich Yunkus, Mark Price, Craig \"Noodles\" Neal, John Salley, Tom Hammonds, and Matt Harpring. Georgia Tech became a charter member of the Southeastern Conference in 1932 (the first season was in 1933) and won the conference title in 1938. Coach Hyder, whose teams won 292 games in 22 seasons, put the program on the national map when his 1955 team defeated Adolph Rupp's Kentucky team, ending the Wildcats' 129-game winning streak at home.\nJohn Hyder.\nThe Yellow Jackets played their first NCAA tournament game in 1960. Coached by Hyder and led by all-American Kaiser, the team defeated Ohio University before losing in the second round to the eventual champion, Ohio State. Hyder continued to have strong teams in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1964, Georgia Tech's final season in the Southeastern Conference, the team went undefeated at home and was the conference runner-up. In 1971 the Yellow Jackets, led by Yunkus, reached the finals of the National Invitation Tournament but lost to the University of North Carolina.\nGeorgia Tech became a charter member of the Metro Conference in 1975 (the first season started in 1976), and then became the eighth member of the ACC in 1978 (starting play in 1979). As of the 2020–21 season, the Yellow Jackets have won four ACC tournament championships and been the ACC's top seed twice. Through 2021, Georgia Tech has received 17 berths in the NCAA tournament, and seven of its teams have made it to the Sweet Sixteen.\nBobby Cremins.\nThe 1985 team, led by head coach Bobby Cremins and players Mark Price, Duane Ferrell, Yvon Joseph, Craig Neal, Bruce Dalrymple, and John Salley, won the school's first ACC championship and advanced to the final eight in the NCAA tournament. In the 1990 tournament, the trio of Kenny Anderson, Dennis Scott, and Brian Oliver (nicknamed \"Lethal Weapon 3\") carried the Yellow Jackets all the way to the Final Four, where they lost to eventual champion UNLV in the national semi-finals. In 1992, Cremins led an inexperienced Tech team to the Sweet 16, thanks in no small part to James Forrest's buzzer-beating game-winning three-pointer in the second round against USC. The following year, the Yellow Jackets won the ACC tournament.\nGeorgia Tech's nine consecutive appearances in the NCAA Tournament from the mid-1980s and the early 1990s accounted for the nation's fourth-longest active streak before it ended in 1994. In 1996, the team finished first in the ACC's regular season and returned to the tournament behind future NBA All-Star Stephon Marbury. Cremins's 19-year tenure (1981–2000) stands as the team's most successful era. Cremins is Georgia Tech's all-time winningest coach and is third among all ACC coaches. Upon his retirement after the 1999–2000 season, his teams had won 354 games and lost 237 for a .599 winning percentage (Cremins would later come out of retirement to coach at the College of Charleston). The floor at McCamish Pavilion is named \"Cremins Court\" in his honor.\nPaul Hewitt.\nIn 2000, head coach Paul Hewitt was hired away from Siena College and immediately helped to revitalize the Yellow Jacket program. In his first season, Georgia Tech beat UCLA, Kentucky and five ACC rivals that were ranked en route to an NCAA tournament appearance. Georgia Tech experienced a Cinderella season in 2003–04: winning the Preseason NIT, ending Duke's 41-game winning streak at Cameron Indoor Stadium, making it to the school's second Final Four and first national championship game, in which they lost by nine points to UConn. Notable players sent to the NBA under Hewitt include Chris Bosh, Jarrett Jack, Mario West, Luke Schenscher, Thaddeus Young, Will Bynum, and Anthony Morrow. In back-to-back years (2008 &amp; 2009), Hewitt also successfully recruited national top-10 high school prospects in Iman Shumpert and Derrick Favors.\nDuring the 2009–10 season, the Yellow Jackets played for the ACC tournament championship game as well as earning Hewitt's fifth NCAA tournament appearance at Tech. They advanced to the round of 32, losing to Ohio State. Georgia Tech then finished the 2010–11 season 13–18. On March 12, 2011, Paul Hewitt was dismissed as the head coach of the Georgia Tech after eleven seasons. Brian Gregory was appointed as his successor, Georgia Tech's 13th men's basketball coach, on March 28, 2011.\nBrian Gregory.\nBrian Gregory, who led Dayton to 97 victories over his last four seasons there and worked under Tom Izzo at Michigan State when the Spartans won the 2000 NCAA championship, was named Georgia Tech's head men's basketball coach on March 28, 2011. In their first season with Gregory at the helm, Georgia Tech finished 11–20 and 11th in the ACC while playing without a true home court while McCamish Pavilion was under construction. Gregory only had two seasons with overall winning records and no seasons of winning records in ACC play. On March 25, 2016, after five disappointing seasons and no trips to the NCAA tournament, Georgia Tech fired Brian Gregory. He was 76–86 overall and 27–61 in ACC play.\nJosh Pastner.\nJosh Pastner was hired by the school on April 8, 2016. Pastner was 167–73 with four NCAA tournament bids in seven years as the head coach of Memphis.\nPastner took Tech to the NIT finals in his first season, and was that season's ACC Coach of the Year. After that season Tech was hit with NCAA violations, although most punishments would later be dropped. Because of this, Tech struggled for the next few seasons. However, Pastner ultimately led the team to their first ACC title since 1993, as well as their first NCAA tournament berth since 2010, as the Yellow Jackets defeated Florida State to win the 2021 ACC championship. They would end up losing to Loyola Chicago in the first round of the NCAA tournament. It is Tech's latest postseason appearance. \nThe success wouldn’t last though, Tech parted ways with Pastner on March 10, 2023 following two disappointing seasons. He finished 109–114 in his seven years coaching the Jackets. He finished as the fourth-winningest coach in school history, behind only Hewitt, Hyder, and Cremins.\nDamon Stoudamire.\nOn March 13, 2023 Damon Stoudamire was named the fifteenth coach in program history. Stoudamire came to Georgia Tech after serving as an assistant coach of the NBA's Boston Celtics for nearly two seasons. Before that he served as the head coach at the University of the Pacific from 2016 to 2021. \nDamon Stoudamire became the first Tech coach in the Yellow Jackets’ ACC history to defeat Duke in his first try when the Yellow Jackets stunned the then seventh ranked Blue Devils 72–68 on December 2, 2023.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Yellow Jackets have appeared in the NCAA tournament 17 times. Their combined record is 23–17.\nNIT results.\nThe Yellow Jackets have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) nine times. Their combined record is 13–9.\nPlayers.\nMany famous and talented players have played with the Yellow Jackets. Dennis Scott was the 1990 National Player of the Year and the 1990 ACC Player of the Year, Jarrett Jack was the 2005 Basketball Times All-South player.\nA notable fictitious player for the Yellow Jackets is eternal Tech student George P. Burdell, who is officially listed in team media guides as having earned three letters (1956–58).\nBasketball Hall of Famers.\nGeorgia Tech has one alumnus in the Basketball Hall of Fame, Chris Bosh who played at Tech from 2002–2003.\nArena.\nThe Hank McCamish Pavilion, rebuilt and renamed from Alexander Memorial Coliseum (also nicknamed \"The Thrillerdome\") in 2012, is an indoor arena located on Tech's Midtown Atlanta campus. It is the home of the Georgia Tech basketball teams and hosted the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association from 1968 to 1972 and again from 1997 to 1999. Tech's women's volleyball team occasionally uses the facility as well, primarily for NCAA tournament games and other matches that draw crowds that would overflow the O'Keefe Gymnasium. During the 2011–12 season, the Yellow Jackets split their home schedule between Philips Arena and the Arena at Gwinnett Center in suburban Duluth while McCamish Pavilion was under reconstruction."

Their record is 2-1\nNotable players.\nNBA.\nSouth Alabama has had 5 former players who have gone on to play in the NBA.\nCoaches.\nCliff Ellis was head coach at the University of South Alabama from 1975 to 1984. He was the all-time winning coach in South Alabama history with a 171–84 (.671) record during nine seasons until Coach Ronnie Arrow surpassed him in 2010. When Ellis became head coach, the administrators at South Alabama were thinking of dropping to Division II. Four years later, he had the Jaguars in the NCAA tournament and six seasons later, they were ranked in the nation's top 10. Ellis, also was the athletic director during part of his tenure, led the Jaguars to three Sun Belt titles, two NCAA Tournament appearances and two NITs.\nFormer NBA Minnesota Timberwolves coach, Bill Musselman returned to the NCAA after a 25-year absence and led the Jaguars to back-to-back NCAA tournament bids in his two years as coach. Musselman's 1997 South Alabama team went 23–7 and nearly upset eventual champion University of Arizona in the opening round of the NCAA tournament.\nBob Weltlich was named interim coach at South Alabama in 1997 following Musselman's sudden resignation. Weltlich coached the Jags from 1997 to 2002 and compiled a record of 81–65 (.559) and three 20-win seasons.\nJohn Pelphrey spent five seasons as head coach at South Alabama. In 2005–06 the Jaguars defeated Western Kentucky University in the Sun Belt Conference tournament championship game, earning USA's first NCAA tournament bid since 1998. The Jaguars lost to the tournament champions, Florida in the round of 64. In 2007, Pelphrey led the Jags to an NIT birth which resulted in a first-round loss to Syracuse (79–73). South Alabama finished the year with a 20–12 record, giving Pelphrey an overall record of 80–67 with the Jags and an offer to coach for the University of Arkansas in the SEC.\nIn his first eight seasons as the Jaguars coach, Ronnie Arrow compiled a record of 114–93 (.551) and was named Sun Belt Coach of the Year in 1989 and 1991. His squads led the Sun Belt Conference in scoring four of his seven seasons at South Alabama. His 1988–89 squad set a school and league record 91 points per game average and five of his seven teams tallied at least 80 points per game. Since his return in 2007, Ronnie Arrow has compiled a 63–34 (64.9%) record and became the all-time winningest coach in South Alabama history with a 177–127 record (11 seasons). He also garnered an at-large bid to the 2008 NCAA tournament, the first for Sun Belt Conference is many years.\nArrow retired December 19, 2012 and was replaced by Jeff Price on an interim basis. On March 25, 2013, Matthew Graves was named as the new head coach of the Jaguars.\nOn March 8, 2018, Graves was fired after 5 seasons after a 65–96 record with no postseason appearances. Exactly 1 week later, the Jaguars hired former Nicholls State head coach Richie Riley for the job.\nArena.\nThe \"Mitchell Center\" 10,041-seat multi-purpose arena was built in 1998. It is home to the University of South Alabama Jaguars men's and women's basketball teams. The 2001 and 2008 Sun Belt Conference men's basketball tournaments were held at the \"Mitchell Center\".\nPrior to moving into the Mitchell Center, the Jaguars had played their home games from 1968 to 1998 at the Jag Gym and the Mobile Civic Center.\nMascot.\nIn 1965 the South Alabama Board of Trustees selected the Jaguar as the university's official mascot and during the late 1960s, USA housed a live Jaguar on the campus. However, the university later decided against housing a live animal on campus after Mischka, the jaguar, was accidentally set free on the campus after someone made the mistake of leaving her pen door unlocked.\nIn the 1971 Retrospect (Yearbook) a person is seen wearing a jaguar costume with a paper mache head covered with spotted fur. By 1972, the costume had changed to a look that showed the persons face and included a fur hat and body. In the late 1970s a mascot-naming contest was held and the name \"South Paw\" was chosen. In 1986 USA began its first structured mascot program, building the image of \"South Paw\" that exists today. A new costume with an enlarged soft head with comical expression have now replaced the old paper mache head.\n\"Miss Pawla\" joined \"South Paw\" in 1992. Today, the duo of \"South Paw\" and \"Miss Pawla\" represent the Jaguars at USA athletic competitions and other events throughout the Mobile community."

        "text": "The American Football Bond Nederland (AFBN) is the governing body for American Football in the Netherlands. The AFBN was founded 1984 and refounded in 2001 after the merger of the rival leagues Nederlandse American Football Federatie (NAFF) and American Football League Nederland (AFLN).\nHistory.\nNederlandse American Football Federatie (NAFF).\nThe Nederlandse American Football Federatie (NAFF) was initially founded on 4 November 1984 by a co-operation between Bob de Jong of the Dutch broadcasting organization Veronica, Peggy Kooper of The Hague Raiders, René Koningferander of the Amsterdam Rams and the governing body of Dutch sport, the Nederlandse Sport Federatie (NSF). A year later, in 1985, the NAFF became a member of the NOC*NSF. The NAFF also became a member of the European Football League (EFL), later known as European Federation of American Football (EFAF).\nIn 1985 the first Dutch American football league competition took place. The 8 teams in the top (and in those days the only) division, would compete against each other for a place in the final of the Dutch American Football championship. The final, called the Super Bowl for one year only, was renamed to the Tulip Bowl in 1986 and has remained so to this day.\nOn 1 May 1986 another organization was formed: the American Football Officials Nederland (AFON). This body was to function as an independent, neutral organization whose main tasks were to recruit, train and deliver officials for AFBN games. Initially, US servicemen based in the Netherlands were recruited to officiate games and train others to become officials.\nAmerican Football League Nederland (AFLN).\nIn 1997, four teams from the NAFF broke away and formed their own organization and league under the name American Football League Nederland (AFLN). The AFLN ran from 1998 until the creation of the AFBN in 2001, with the Rotterdam Trojans winning the first AFLN championship.\nAmerican Football Bond Nederland (AFBN).\nAfter 1998, the sport began to grow again with more teams springing up in the Netherlands. In 2001 the NAFF and AFLN organizations agreed to merge under the name American Football Bond Nederland (AFBN). This made it possible to organize different levels of play and three divisions were created. In 2005 this was reduced to the current format of two divisions with a third developmental tier.\nThe winners of the Premier League (Eredivisie) championship (the Tulip Bowl) are the official national champions of the Netherlands.\nPremier League.\nIn 2021, the AFBN Premier League (Eredivisie) has eight teams split into two pools:\nFirst Division.\nIn 2021, the AFBN First Division has 10 teams, and 2 combination teams made up of members from multiple of those teams."

        "title": "British rugby league system",
        "text": "The British rugby league system is based on a five-tier structure administered by the Rugby Football League.\nProfessional clubs.\nThe top three divisions in Britain consist of the following professional or semi-professional clubs:\nNon-British clubs.\nIn 2005 the new franchise was awarded to Catalans Dragons to play in the 2006 Super League. To help make sure the franchise did not fail as the PSG franchise did, the RFL allowed the Dragons to sign players from other French teams for no transfer fee. They were also promised to be exempted from relegation for 3 years. In their first season they finished bottom of the league but Castleford Tigers were the team relegated. Over the next few years they continually improved and in 2007 they became the first French team to reach a Challenge Cup Final. In 2018 they were the first non-British team to win the Challenge Cup.\nIn 2009 Toulouse applied for a Super League licence but failed; however, the RFL were impressed with their application and invited them to play in the Championship. In their first season they finished the season 10th but were not relegated due to it being their first season in the British structure. In their second season they improved finishing 8th but missing out on the playoffs. In 2011 they were relegated but chose to return to the French Elite One Championship after they failed to get into Super League. In 2015 it was announced the RFL had invited them to play in League 1 from 2016 in the hope they can get promoted to Super League. Toulouse now play in the Championship, having earned promotion in their inaugural League 1 season of 2016.\nHistory.\nThe first season of rugby league (1895–96) saw all the clubs play in a single league competition. The addition of new teams and the problems of travelling led to the league being split in two for the following season; into the Yorkshire League and the Lancashire League. In the 1897–98 season Lancashire added professional second and third competitions, but the third competition only lasted one season. Yorkshire added a professional second competition (split west and east to reduce travelling) for the 1898–99 season. The bottom teams from the senior competition played a promotion/relegation test match against the winner of their county's second competition. This arrangement lasted until the 1901–02, when the top clubs from each league formed a single new competition. This saw the Lancashire and Yorkshire Senior Leagues elect numerous clubs from the second competitions (5 from Lancashire and 7 from Yorkshire) with the second competitions subsequently scrapped and teams excluded from the senior competitions joining either the Lancashire Combination (reserve grade) and a new Yorkshire Senior League or reverting to amateur status, either within the Northern Union or in the case of many Yorkshire clubs back to rugby union. However, many clubs folded and some even switched to association football. The following season most of the remaining clubs in the Yorkshire and Lancashire Leagues were re-organised to form a Second Division, although four teams from the Yorkshire League and two from the Lancashire league were not elected to the new second division (but South Shields who had played in no league in 1901–02 were).\nIn 1905–06, the two divisions were re-combined into a single competition. Initially clubs arranged all their own fixtures with the condition that they had to play teams they do play both home and away. After this a new structure was introduced where clubs played all the teams in their own county on a home-and-away basis, results counting towards the re-formed Yorkshire and Lancashire Leagues, although due to imbalance in number of teams it was common for a Yorkshire club to have to play in the Lancashire League. They also had home-and-away fixtures scheduled against a small number of teams in the other competition (usually three); all results were collated into a single table for the Championship. In order to even up the competition a top-four play-off series was used to determine the Championship.\nApart from the interventions of the world wars, this system was retained until 1962–63, when the league briefly returned to a two divisional system. This lasted only two seasons, and in 1964–65 they went back to one large division subdivided into county leagues, but the play-off were expanded to the top 16 teams.\nIn 1973–74 they again went back to two divisions. The play-off and the Yorkshire and Lancashire League were abandoned, though a new play-off type competition, the Club Championship was introduced to replace the championship play-offs.\nThe following season saw the title change to Premiership and the format was altered so that only the top eight teams in the First Division would compete. A similar competition was later instituted for clubs in the lower league(s). In the 1991–92 and 1992–93 seasons, a Third Division was played. However, the league reverted to two divisions for the 1993–94 and 1994–95 seasons, controversially demoting three clubs to the National Conference League in the process.\nIn 1996 the Premiership was replaced by the Super League. The clubs outside of Super League played in the First Division which now came under Super League, and the clubs that previously played in Division Three now played in a retitled the Second Division.\nBetween 1999 and 2002, rugby league below Super League was re-organised into one large competition, the Northern Ford Premiership. In 2003, the NFP was divided into National Leagues 1 and 2 with a National League 3 made up from sides drawn from the Rugby League Conference and British Amateur Rugby League Association winter leagues. It was intended that at some future point promotion and relegation would be allowed between National League 3 and National League 2, however, in 2006 National League 3 was rebranded Rugby League Conference National Division and plans for promotion and relegation were scrapped.\nIn 2009, the National Leagues were renamed the Championship and Championship 1. Between 2009 and 2014 automatic promotion and relegation between Super League and the Championship was replaced by a franchise system. Teams in the Championship would have to apply for a licence to play in Super League. Licences were reviewed every 5 years.\nIn 2013, it was announced that there was to be a review into the structure of the Rugby League system in Europe. Clubs, fans and sponsors were asked about their needs from the system. Three options were reviewed; one system using two leagues of 10, with the Super League and Championship having one promotion and relegation place between the two. The format of promotion was to be decided later. The second option was the same system, with Promotion and Relegation between the two, but with 12 teams in each division. The third option was most radical, and featured two leagues of 12, which would, after 11 games, split to three groups of 8. This would be mixed with a new funding structure. On 17 January 2014, it was announced the third option had been selected, but had been changed to split after 23 games, which would be a complete round-robin and an added fixture, the Magic Weekend. From 2015, this was decided to be the new structure.\nIn preparation for the new structure, it was decided across the two leagues, Championship and Super League, there would be a season of realignment, in which five clubs would be relegated from the Championship, and one promoted to the Championship, and two teams would be relegated from the Super League to the Championship. This meant that the Super League, from 2015, would be made up of the 12 remaining teams from the Super League XIX season, and a Championship made up of the two relegated teams from the Super League, one team promoted from the 2014 Championship 1 and the nine remaining Championship teams. League 1, which would be modelled on the Championship, would be made out of the five relegated Championship teams, 8 current League 1 teams, and Coventry Bears.\nMen's structure.\nTier 1: Super League.\nThe top tier of rugby league in the United Kingdom is the Super League. It features 12 teams with 11 teams from Northern England and 1 from France. The top six teams enter the play-offs and the winner is determined by the Super League Grand Final. The 12th placed team is relegated, from 2024 this will be subject to an off-field criteria as well.\nTier 2: Championship.\nBelow the Super League is the RFL Championship. A similar play-off structure which accumulates with the Championship Grand Final is used to determine the winners of the Championship and thus promotion to Super League. First place in regular season is awarded the RFL Championship Leaders' Shield, while the bottom two teams are relegated.\nTier 3: League 1.\nLeague 1 is the final tier of professional rugby league in the UK. It currently contains 10 teams and sees the league leader declared champion and promoted, and a playoff system for teams two to six to gain the final promotion spot.\nTier 4: Conference League.\nThe highest amateur league is the National Conference League for the heartlands, which consists of four divisions (Premier Division, Division One, Division two and Division Three) of up to 14 teams each, and Conference League South for elsewhere consisting of 8 teams. There is promotion and relegation between each division – three up and three down – for the heartlands competition. The bottom two teams from Division Three face re-election each year. Teams must apply to be promoted to League 1.\nTier 5: Regional Leagues.\nBelow the Conference League are a series of regional leagues, some of which still play in the winter, teams must apply to get promoted to the Conference Leagues.\nWomen's structure.\nThe women's conference was the top tier of British rugby league until 2014 when the RFL Women's Rugby League was introduced with the aim of creating an elite top tier. This became the RFL Women's Super League in 2017, and also saw a second tier RFL Women's Championship introduced. The RFL Women's Super League South was introduced in 2021 to run parallel to the Super League, however this would become a second tier competition in the restructured Championship which started in 2024."

        "text": "Jim Dutcher (born April 17, 1933) is a former head basketball coach at the University of Minnesota.\nEarly life and education.\nDutcher was born and raised in Alpena, Michigan. He graduated from Alpena High School in 1951 where he was class president and a three-sport athlete, earning All-State honors in football and basketball. He attended the University of Michigan, where he received an Elmer Gideon Scholarship to play football and basketball. A member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity, he majored in physical education, graduating with a B.S. in 1955 and earning an M.A. from the University of Michigan in 1961. Dutcher joined the Army in 1955, serving as a member of the 3rd Armored Division and was stationed in Frankfurt, Germany. He coached and played on the 3rd Armored Division Artillery basketball team while in Germany, and also coached the offensive line for the Armored Division football team. Dutcher married his high school sweetheart, Marilyn, in 1957.\nEarly coaching career.\nDutcher began his coaching career at Alpena Community College where he served as Athletic Director and head basketball coach culminating in a trip to the National Junior College Tournament in 1966. He was twice named conference coach of the year. In 1966, he became the head basketball coach at Eastern Michigan University, where he was named National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) District Coach of the Year in 1971 and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) District 4, Coach of the Year in 1972.\nWhile at Eastern Michigan, his team played in the NAIA National Tournament in Kansas City in 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970 and 1971; and the NCAA College Division Finals in Evansville, Indiana in 1972. Prominent players Dutcher coached at Eastern Michigan included Kennedy McIntosh, who played with the Seattle SuperSonics; Earl Higgins, who played with the Indiana Pacers; Harvey Marlatt, who played with the Detroit Pistons; and Hall of Famer George Gervin, nicknamed \"The Iceman,\" who played with the Virginia Squires, San Antonio Spurs and Chicago Bulls.\nDutcher became an assistant coach at his alma mater, the University of Michigan, under head coach Johnny Orr. During the 1974-75 season the team won the Big Ten Championship.\nMinnesota head coach.\nDutcher took over the Gophers program in 1975 following the departure of Bill Musselman. The highlight of his time at Minnesota was 1982, a season in which he led the Gophers to the Big Ten Championship — to date, the last \"official\" conference title for the Gophers — and a Sweet 16 appearance. He was named the Big Ten Coach of the Year in 1982.\nProminent players coached by Dutcher at Minnesota included Ray Williams, who later played for the New York Knicks; Mychal Thompson, who played for the Portland Trail Blazers and Los Angeles Lakers; Kevin McHale, who played for the Boston Celtics; Trent Tucker, who played for the New York Knicks and Chicago Bulls; Randy Breuer, who played for the Milwaukee Bucks, Minnesota Timberwolves, Atlanta Hawks and Sacramento Kings; Flip Saunders, who became an NBA coach for the Minnesota Timberwolves, Detroit Pistons, and Washington Wizards; Osborne Lockhart, who played for the Harlem Globetrotters; Jim Peterson, who played for the Houston Rockets; Darrell Mitchell, who was named first-team All-Big Ten, and Tommy Davis, also a first-team All-Big Ten player.\nOn January 25, 1986, three Gopher players were arrested on rape charges in Madison, Wisconsin. A Madison woman claimed the players raped her at their team hotel hours after the Gophers played the Wisconsin Badgers. After the arrests, U of M officials canceled the Gophers' next scheduled game, against Northwestern, citing the arrests and a series of less serious incidents prior to the arrests. Not agreeing with the University's decision to forfeit the game, Dutcher resigned as head coach. All three players were ultimately acquitted of all charges.\nPost-coaching career.\nDutcher went on to become a registered financial advisor and became a Senior Vice President for Royal Bank of Canada-Dain. He retired from RBC in 2005.\nFamily.\nDutcher and his wife Marilyn had four children; son Brian Dutcher is the head basketball coach at San Diego State; daughter Diane McNutt is Vice President of Human Capital at UnitedHealthcare; Judi Dutcher is an attorney, the former Minnesota State Auditor and the CEO of the Bentson Foundation; and Barbara Jacobson is a Director of Market Research at UnitedHealthcare. Marilyn Dutcher died in 2010."

        "text": "Alberto Ramón González (born April 18, 1983) is a Venezuelan professional baseball infielder. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, Washington Nationals, San Diego Padres, Texas Rangers, and Chicago Cubs.\nProfessional career.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nGonzález was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Arizona Diamondbacks on August 3, 2002. He spent his first three years in the minors, playing for the Single-A South Bend Silver Hawks in 2004 and 2005, and the Double-A Tennessee Smokies and Triple-A Tucson Sidewinders in 2006. \nNew York Yankees.\nOn January 5, 2007, he was traded with pitchers Luis Vizcaíno, Ross Ohlendorf, and Steven Jackson to the New York Yankees for Randy Johnson. González began the 2007 season with the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees, but was demoted to the Trenton Thunder after struggling.\nThe Yankees called up González on September 1, 2007, as part of the September expanded rosters. He made his major league debut that day as a defensive replacement. On September 8, 2007, he got his first RBI by grounding into a fielder's choice and later scored his first run. On April 9, 2008, González was called up to provide back-up for injured Derek Jeter. He took the roster spot of Shelley Duncan.\nWashington Nationals.\nOn July 31, 2008, González was traded to the Washington Nationals for minor league right-handed pitcher Jhonny Núñez.

        "text": "Jerome Patrick Butler (born February 27, 1951) is a Canadian former ice hockey winger who spent 11 seasons in the National Hockey League. During his career, he was known as a fast, gritty defensive specialist with a limited offensive upside.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in Sarnia, Ontario, Butler was selected 55th overall by the New York Rangers in the 1971 NHL Amateur Draft despite scoring only six goals in junior the previous season. He spent most of his first two professional seasons in the minors, earning an eight-game callup during the 1972–73 season during which he scored his first NHL goal. Called up again late in the 1973–74 campaign, he impressed with 16 points in 26 games, and remained with the team during the playoffs, appearing in 12 of 13 games.\nIn 1974–75, Butler's first full NHL season, he recorded 17 goals and 16 assists for 33 points in 78 games, and earned a positive reputation for his speed, hustle, and quality defensive play. However, at the conclusion of the season he was traded to the St. Louis Blues as the centerpiece of a deal for star goaltender John Davidson.\nIn St. Louis, he received the opportunity to play on one of the Blues' top lines with Garry Unger and Bob MacMillan, and responded with the finest year of his career, finishing the 1975–76 season with 17 goals and 41 points despite missing 14 games due to injury. He had another solid year in 1976–77, posting 12 goals and 32 points for the Blues.\nButler was dealt from the Blues to the Toronto Maple Leafs for Inge Hammarström on November 1, 1977. In Toronto, he received less icetime, as coach Roger Neilson used him exclusively as a defensive/penalty killing specialist. Although his offensive numbers suffered and he finished the year with just 18 points, he was by now considered one of the best penalty killers in the NHL, and was an important part of a Toronto team which nearly reached the Stanley Cup finals in 1978.\nButler spent three seasons in Toronto before being dealt to the Vancouver Canucks late in the 1979–80 season. (Dave \"Tiger\" Williams was also dealt to Vancouver as part of the same trade; in exchange Toronto received Bill Derlago and Rick Vaive.) In 1980–81, Butler recorded 12 goals and 32 points for Vancouver, his highest offensive totals since his time in St. Louis. However, he lost his spot in the Canucks lineup during the 1981–82 season and was sent to the minors for the first time since 1974, and thus missed the Stanley Cup finals in 1982.\nReleased by the Canucks, he signed with the Winnipeg Jets as a free agent for 1982–83. He recorded three goals and nine points in 42 games, but was demoted to the minors late in the season. Rather than accept the assignment, he chose to retire.\nButler finished his NHL career with 99 goals and 120 assists for 219 points in 641 games, along with 515 penalty minutes."

        "title": "2007 Stanley Cup Finals",
        "text": "The 2007 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 2006–07 season, and the culmination of the 2007 Stanley Cup playoffs. It was contested between the Western Conference champion Anaheim Ducks and the Eastern Conference champion Ottawa Senators. It was the second appearance in the Finals for Anaheim since 2003 (known at the time as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim), when they lost to the New Jersey Devils. It was the first appearance for the Senators since entering the NHL as an expansion team in 1992. Anaheim defeated Ottawa in five games and were awarded their first Stanley Cup becoming the eleventh post-1967 expansion team to win the NHL championship trophy, and the first Stanley Cup championship for a team from California. This was also the last Finals in which both teams were seeking their first Stanley Cup until 2018, as well as the fifth straight Finals to feature a team vying for its first Stanley Cup.\nBrothers Scott and Rob Niedermayer both played for the Ducks team, becoming the first set of brothers to win the Stanley Cup together since Duane and Brent Sutter accomplished the feat twice with the New York Islanders in 1982 and 1983.\nPaths to the Finals.\nPrior to the season, the Ducks had been the pick of many in the media to make it to the Final, and they did not disappoint. The second-seeded Anaheim Ducks defeated both the Minnesota Wild and Vancouver Canucks in five games before defeating their rivals the Detroit Red Wings in six games in the Western Conference Final. The Ducks had the most penalties out of any team during the post-season and had one suspension going into the final, but had a top penalty-kill percentage. They were led by two Norris Trophy candidates captain Scott Niedermayer and Chris Pronger, the scoring touches of Andy McDonald, Teemu Selanne, Ryan Getzlaf, and the goaltending of Jean-Sebastien Giguere. The Ducks were looking to shut down Ottawa's offense with the checking line of Rob Niedermayer, Samuel Pahlsson and Travis Moen, and overall team defence.\nThe fourth-seeded Ottawa Senators defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins, and upset both the New Jersey Devils and Buffalo Sabres, all in five games apiece, en route to their first Eastern Conference championship. Ottawa was led by the top line of captain Daniel Alfredsson, Dany Heatley, and Jason Spezza, who combined for 23 goals in the first three rounds, and the goaltending of Ray Emery. Other Senators who played pivotal roles were forwards Mike Fisher and Dean McAmmond and defencemen Chris Phillips and Anton Volchenkov. The Senators were looking to work past Anaheim's defence with their speed and higher-scoring offence, although both teams played a similar style of responsible team defence.\nAnaheim had home ice advantage for the series, as they finished the regular season with 110 points to Ottawa's 105. The attention leading into the finals was Ottawa being \"Canada's Team\" despite Anaheim having five more Canadian skaters than the Senators. Many fans were saying that the Stanley Cup needed to be brought back to Canada after a 14-year drought (up to that point, the last Canadian team to hoist the Stanley Cup was the 1993 Montreal Canadiens, who defeated the Los Angeles Kings).\nGame summaries.\nOnly four players remained on the Ducks roster from 2003, including the Conn Smythe Trophy winner, Jean-Sebastien Giguere. The 2003 club's general manager, Bryan Murray, was now the Ottawa head coach.\nTwo Ottawa-area players were in the finals, playing for the Ducks.\nThe Senators and Ducks had never met in the playoffs before, and had not played each other since January 19, 2006, when the Ducks (then known as the Mighty Ducks) won 4–3 in a shootout in Ottawa.\nHistorical facts.\nThis was the first time since the 1925 Victoria Cougars that a team from the west coast of North America won the Stanley Cup, and the first time an NHL team from the west coast had done so. The Ducks are the fourth west coast team to win the Cup, and the first from California.\nSenators captain Daniel Alfredsson, from Sweden, was the first European-born-and-raised captain to lead his team to the finals. Previously, only Canadians or an American had captained teams in the finals. The Ducks were captained by a Canadian (Scott Niedermayer) and had more Canadian players than the Senators.\nAs of the end of the 2021 playoffs, the Senators remain the only Canadian team to represent the East in the finals since 1993 (the 2021 Montreal Canadiens did not represent the East in the 2021 Stanley Cup Finals due to temporary abolishment of the conferences). These finals marked the third straight in which a Canadian franchise lost against a franchise based in the southern half of the United States (previous Canadian teams in the last few Stanley Cup Finals were the 2004 Calgary Flames and the 2006 Edmonton Oilers, and not counting the 2004–05 NHL season lockout).\nThe series marked the first time that two teams from the early-'90s expansion era faced each other in the final. (Anaheim had started play in 1993, Ottawa in 1992)\nIt was the first finals since 1999 where neither finalist had won the Stanley Cup previously (the NHL does not recognize the championships of the original Ottawa Senators as part of the current franchise's history).\nAs well, this was the third season in a row that the Cup was won by a team winning its first Cup after Tampa Bay in 2004 and Carolina in 2006.\nIt was also the 1st finals since the 2002 Stanley Cup Finals, when Detroit defeated Carolina in 5 games, that didn't need a 7th game after New Jersey in 2003, Tampa Bay in 2004, and Carolina in 2006 all won in 7 games\nThe third game, in Ottawa on June 2, was attended by 91-year-old Russell Williams as a guest of the Senators. He had attended the last Finals game in Ottawa (April 13, 1927) versus the Boston Bruins in the old Ottawa Auditorium. His presence was a good-luck charm, as Ottawa won the game he attended.\nSens Mile.\nMuch like the Red Mile in Calgary during the Flames' 2004 cup run and the Blue Mile in Edmonton during the Oilers' 2006 Cup run, Ottawa Senators fans took to the streets to celebrate their team's success. The idea to have a Sens Mile began as a grassroots campaign on Facebook by Ottawa residents before game four of the Ottawa-Buffalo Eastern Conference Finals series.\nTheir idea was to use Elgin Street as a gathering place for Sens fans to celebrate after games won. Since Scotiabank Place (now Canadian Tire Centre) is located in suburban Ottawa, spontaneous celebration did not occur during the Senators' Cup run until that point, like it did in Calgary and Edmonton where the arenas are located more centrally.\nWhen the Senators beat the Sabres in game five of the Eastern Conference Final, people flocked to Elgin Street in celebration.\nFor the Stanley Cup Finals, large video screens were installed at Ottawa City Hall for fans to view. After the Senators won game three of the series, fans celebrated on Elgin Street once again, and Ottawa Police closed the street down.\nGame one.\nThe scene was festive at Honda Center in Anaheim with several Hollywood celebrities on hand, including former movie star and then California Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who dropped the puck for the ceremonial face-off. As in their previous series, the Senators struck first. Mike Fisher started off the scoring in the series with a power-play goal 1:38 into the first period that travelled high in the air, landed behind Giguere and trickled over the line. Although Ottawa scored first, Anaheim took over play during the course of the period. The Ducks replied nine minutes later with a goal from Andy McDonald at even strength. Ottawa was unable to get even one shot on goal in the last eleven minutes of the first, and the period ended with the score tied 1–1. The shots were 8–3 for Anaheim. Early into the second, Wade Redden scored the only goal of the period, another power-play goal for Ottawa from the blue line, putting the Senators up 2–1. Play was even for the most part, as indicated by the 10–10 shot total of the period. The Ducks dominated most of the play in the third, tying the game 2–2 at five minutes into the third on a goal from Ryan Getzlaf, followed by a dramatic game-winning goal by Travis Moen with three minutes left in the third. The shots ended 32–20 in Anaheim's favour. In 2009, it was disclosed by Tom Molloy, hockey coach and friend of Dany Heatley, that Heatley was injured by a cross-check of Chris Pronger in this game. Heatley would continue to play for the rest of the series and the injury was kept secret. Heatley would score only one goal in the series.\nGame two.\nStrong defence and goaltending from both sides kept scoring down to nothing until Samuel Pahlsson scored the game-winning goal for the Ducks 14:16 into the third period. Once again, Anaheim's checking line of Samuel Pahlsson, Travis Moen, and Rob Niedermayer managed to shut down and out-score the Ottawa top line of Daniel Alfredsson, Dany Heatley, and Jason Spezza. Anaheim again led the shot count with 31 shots to Ottawa's 16. Ray Emery in the Ottawa net played his best game of the series.\nGame three.\nPlay now switched to Ottawa, for the first Stanley Cup Finals game in Ottawa in 80 years (as well as the first Finals game played in the province of Ontario for the first time in 40 years). The Senators hoped to regroup, being down 2–0, with two wins at home.\nAfter an energetic crowd took over the singing of O Canada from Ontario Provincial Police Constable Lyndon Slewidge, the Senators came out tentative and Andy McDonald opened the scoring in game three to give Anaheim a 1–0 lead 5:39 into the first period. Ottawa replied 11 minutes later with a goal by Chris Neil.\nCorey Perry scored to give Anaheim a 2–1 lead at 5:20 in the second; the lead was short-lived, as Mike Fisher scored 27 seconds later. Two minutes later, Ryan Getzlaf scored to once again give Anaheim a one-goal advantage. Ottawa then replied with a goal by Daniel Alfredsson.\nAlfredsson's goal was initially waved off by referees because the puck went in off his skate, appearing to have been kicked in. The NBC broadcasters thought the goal would be waved off. But the officials reviewing the goal ruled that there was no kicking motion and allowed the goal to stand, tying the game once again. NHL rules allow the redirection of a puck with the foot, as long as no kicking motion is involved, and this was the ruling.\nLater in the period, Dean McAmmond got credited with a goal that ricocheted off Chris Pronger's stick. Near the beginning of the third period, McAmmond was injured after receiving an elbow to the head from Pronger, in what might have been retribution for the goal, as McAmmond's shot had appeared to have been aimed at Pronger, and not at the net. As in the previous series against Detroit (in which he delivered a similar blow to Detroit's Tomas Holmstrom), Pronger was not penalized during the game for his hit on McAmmond, but was later suspended for game four. Pronger claimed the elbow was accidental and the Ducks did not appeal the suspension. McAmmond did not return to play in the series, and this was a loss for the Senators as he had been an effective player.\nAnton Volchenkov scored midway through the third to give the Senators a two-goal lead. Neither team scored any goals through the balance of the period, and Ottawa won the game 5–3, their first and only win in the Stanley Cup Finals, as of 2022.\nGame four.\nThe national anthems were sung by Ottawa native Alanis Morissette, who also sang the anthem prior to the first game in October, 1992 of the Senators. The audience again took over the singing of \"O Canada.\"\nAnaheim Ducks defenceman Chris Pronger was suspended for game four because of an elbow he delivered to the head of Senator Dean McAmmond in game three. Once again, the Ducks had to deal with the loss of Pronger while the Senators were itching to win both home games and tie the series.\nAfter nearly a full period of scoreless play, Daniel Alfredsson scored at 19:59 (0.3 seconds remained) of the first to give the Senators a 1–0 lead on a powerplay goal. The momentum seemed to continue shifting from game three in Ottawa's favor as Anaheim could only get two shots the entire period.\nIn the second, the Ducks replied with two goals by Andy McDonald midway through the period to put them up 2–1. Ottawa came back with two minutes left in the period to tie the game 2–2 on a goal from Dany Heatley, his only goal of the series.\nThe game's most controversial moment came in the final five seconds of the second period. With the puck at center ice, Alfredsson shot the puck, which hit Scott Niedermayer. The incident appeared intentional, although Alfredsson claimed after the game that it was not. Niedermayer was not injured, but the Ducks were furious, sparking a post-buzzer scrum next to the Anaheim bench before the teams left the ice for the intermission. To the surprise of NBC's broadcasters, Alfredsson was not penalized for his actions, but Mike Fisher and Samuel Pahlsson were each handed matching minors for roughing.\nThe Ducks responded to the incident on the score board as Dustin Penner scored at 4:07 of the third to provide the winning 3–2 Anaheim margin, putting them up 3–1 in the series and provided an opportunity for the Ducks to clinch the Cup in game five.\nGame five.\nThe Ducks' home crowd at Honda Center booed every time Daniel Alfredsson touched the puck in response to Alfredsson's controversial shot at Scott Niedermayer in game four, although this did not appear to put him off his game as he scored two goals. However, his play was the only bright spot on the night for the Senators.\nThe final game was marked by strong play by the Ducks, and mistakes and bad luck for the Senators, as they attempted to stave off elimination and seemed to try too hard, while the Ducks played with confidence and without mistakes. The game was played 'close-to-the-vest', with only 31 shots on goal by the two teams.\nIn the first period, Andy McDonald and Rob Niedermayer of Anaheim scored the first and second goals, respectively. McDonald's goal came on the power play on a penalty to Ottawa for obstruction; the call that the Senators had claimed was not being called against the Ducks. The goal went off the skate of Chris Phillips, the start of an unlucky night for the Ottawa defenceman. Niedermayer's goal deflated the Senators further as it appeared that Emery should have stopped it.\nIn the second period, Senators captain Daniel Alfredsson cut the lead to 2–1. However, the turning point of the game came when Chris Phillips and Ray Emery were involved in a mix-up resulting in an own goal, which was awarded to Travis Moen, giving Anaheim a 3–1 lead.\nLater in the period, Alfredsson scored a 'highlight-reel' short-handed goal to close the gap to 3–2. It appeared that he was trying to carry the whole team on his back, but on the same power play, defenceman Francois Beauchemin scored moments later to restore the Ducks two-goal lead, 4–2. Beauchemin's goal deflected off the shin pad of Ottawa defenceman Anton Volchenkov, the NHL's leading shot blocker, who was attempting to block the shot, behind Emery.\nIn the third period, Travis Moen scored to give Anaheim a commanding 5–2 lead. The Senators kept trying, and Antoine Vermette was awarded a rare penalty shot; however the puck rolled off his stick at the last moment. Corey Perry scored the final goal off of a loose pass by Ottawa to provide the winning margin of 6–2, and, with the exception of Scott Niedermayer, every member of the Ducks franchise won their first Stanley Cup.\nTeam rosters.\nYears indicated in boldface under the \"Finals appearance\" column signify that the player won the Stanley Cup in the given year.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 2007 Stanley Cup was presented to Ducks captain Scott Niedermayer by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman following the Ducks 6–2 win over the Senators in game five.\nThe following Ducks players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n2006–07 Anaheim Ducks\nTelevision and ratings.\nThe 2007 Stanley Cup Finals was also notable for its exceptionally poor television ratings in the United States. Games one and two were carried by cable channel Versus, then a new and little known player on the sports television scene. Game one produced a 0.5 national rating or 523,000 households. It was the 58th best rated program of that day. Game two produced a 0.4 national rating or 446,000 households, the 74th best rated program of that day, lower than the 2006 WNBA All-Star Game on ESPN which drew 447,000 households.\nThe move to NBC for the remainder of the finals did little to compensate for the series' limited drawing power. A perennial last among the Big Four American television networks, NBC was at the time going through an intense period of ratings turmoil, setting lowest rated week records in several viewing categories over the course of spring 2007.\nGame three's coverage on NBC garnered a mere 1.1 rating (approximately 1,205,600 households), making it the lowest rated prime-time broadcast in the network's history. For comparison, game six of the , broadcast opposite game three on cable channel TNT, achieved a 5.3 rating, approximately 5,808,800 households. Game four achieved a 1.9 rating (approximately 2,082,400 households), down 5 percent from game four the previous year. Game five received slightly less, 1.8 (approximately 1,972,800 households). As a whole, NBC's ratings for the championship series were down 20 percent from the previous season, making it the least watched finals in the United States.\nAt the time, Versus was only available to 50 percent of cable-equipped homes in the Los Angeles area, which hurt the buzz around the Ducks' playoff run in a traditionally crowded sports and entertainment market. Versus was the fifth-most watched cable network in the Los Angeles market for game one, good only for a 1.7 local rating.\nLocal numbers did improve as the series moved to free-to-air NBC. The Cup-clinching game five drew a 6.0 and a 12 share for an average audience of 496,000 viewers in the Los Angeles market, more than double that of a high-profile regular season game between baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres on KCAL 9 (3.0/5, 218,000 viewers). This symbolic, if short-lived, win over one of the region's flagship teams allowed the Ducks to close the series on a relatively high note, with the \"Los Angeles Times\"' Larry Stewart calling their final ratings performance \"pretty good\".\nOn the CBC, Hockey Night in Canada pulled in 2,608,000, 2,378,000, and 2,553,000 viewers for games one, two and three respectively, slightly higher than their numbers for equivalent games the previous year. This was the last finals that Bob Cole (play-by-play announcer) and Harry Neale (colour commentator) worked together. The following year, Cole worked with Greg Millen."

On August 4, 2023, Arizona announced it would join the Big 12 Conference beginning in the 2024–25 academic year, after spending 50 years in the Pac-10/12 conference.\nThe program came to national prominence during the tenure of former head coach Lute Olson (1983-2007), who established the program as among America's elite in college basketball. One writer referred to U of A as \"Point Guard U\" because the school has produced successful guards like Steve Kerr, Damon Stoudamire, Khalid Reeves, Mike Bibby, Jason Terry, Gilbert Arenas, Jason Gardner, Jerryd Bayless, and T. J. McConnell, among others.\nFrom 1985 to 2009, the Arizona basketball team reached the NCAA Division I tournament for 25 consecutive years, tied for 3rd longest in NCAA history. Despite having their 1999 and 2008 appearances later vacated by the NCAA, the media still cites Arizona's streak, and simply notes the changes. The Wildcats have reached the Final Four of the NCAA tournament on four occasions (1988, 1994, 1997, and 2001). They have also made two appearances in the National Championship (won over Kentucky Wildcats in 1997, lost to Duke Blue Devils in 2001). In Pac-10 play, former head coach Lute Olson currently holds the record for most wins as a Pac-10 coach with 327. In addition, the team has won 18 Pac-10/12 regular season championship titles and 9 Pac-10/12 tournament championship titles. Arizona also holds the distinction of recording five out of the seven 17–1 Pac-10 seasons (one-loss seasons). In 2022 Arizona became the first team in conference history to win 18 conference games in a season. No team has gone undefeated since the formation of the Pac-10/12.\nArizona ranks eighteenth all-time heading into the 2024–25 season with 1,889 wins and ranks eight by winning percentage at (). Arizona has spent 39 weeks at No. 1 in the AP Poll, which is ninth-most all-time; 30 weeks at No. 2, ninth most all-time; 174 weeks in the Top 5, seventh all-time; 345 weeks in the Top 10, sixth all-time; and 607 weeks in the top 25, seventh all-time.\nTeam history.\nEarly years (1904−1925).\nThe University of Arizona fielded its first men's basketball team in 1904–05. Orin Albert Kates coached the team and drew opponents from local YMCAs. The first game Arizona played ended in a 40–32 victory over the Morenci YMCA.\nIn 1914, Arizona's first famous coach, James Fred \"Pop\" McKale was lured away from a teaching and coaching job at Tucson High School to take over as Athletic Director and coach basketball, football, baseball and track. McKale took things to a new level, posting a 9–0 record his first season as a basketball coach. Moreover, McKale elevated the program to intercollegiate play. While basketball was his least favorite of the many sports he coached while at U of A, he chalked up three undefeated seasons and a career-winning average of .803, which has never been bested by a U of A coach who has held the post for at least three years. The McKale Memorial Center, the main arena for Arizona basketball, is named in his honor.\nFred Enke (1925−61).\nFrom 1925 to 1961, the program was under the stewardship of Fred Enke, U of A's longest-tenured coach. Coach Fred A. Enke was responsible for the early successes of Wildcat basketball. Enke amassed 509 wins in his tenure on the U of A sidelines and still ranks as the second-winningest coach in school history, winning more than 60 percent of his games. Enke also led the Cats to the first four postseason appearances (3 N.I.T./1 NCAA) in school history and in 1950–51 competed in both the N.I.T. and NCAA postseason tournaments. Finally, he was the first coach to lead Arizona to a national ranking. Two of his teams (1950, 1951) finished the season ranked in the top 15.\nUnder Enke, U of A competed in the now-defunct Border Conference. Under Enke's direction, Arizona won 12 conference championships, including a span in which the Cats won or shared seven consecutive Border Conference titles (1942–51). No Border Conference team won as many league games (231) or overall contests (398) during its membership. In 1962, Arizona joined the Western Athletic Conference as a founding member after the Border Conference disbanded.\nBruce Larson (1961−71).\nBruce Larson, a player and assistant under Enke before coaching at Eastern Arizona and Weber State, coached the Wildcats from 1961 to 1971, leading the school to a 136–148 record. Under his tenure, major planning began for a larger and more modern basketball arena (which would become McKale Center) to replace the outdated Bear Down Gymnasium. Larson would later serve as an analyst on Wildcat football and basketball telecasts during the Lute Olson (and Dick Tomey) era.\nFred Snowden (1973−1982).\nIn 1972, Fred Snowden was hired as the head basketball coach, making Arizona the second Division I school and the first major program to hire an African American head coach. Known as \"The Fox\", Snowden brought the excitement back to Wildcat basketball during his 10 years on the Arizona sideline, averaging more than 80 points per game in six of his 10 years and topping the 100-point barrier 27 times. Snowden led Arizona to the NCAA tournament twice, in 1976 and 1977, getting as far as the Elite Eight in 1976 before losing to UCLA 82–66, a game after defeating UNLV in a Sweet Sixteen matchup. During the 1976 tournament, he also logged Arizona's first and only tournament wins until Lute Olson's hiring, beating John Thompson's Georgetown team 83–76. Snowden's 1976 team also won the school's only WAC championship title on a buzzer-beater by Gilbert Myles verses New Mexico, with the help of the spectacular play of Bob Elliott, Jim Rappis, and Al Fleming. In 1978, Coach Snowden helped transition the basketball program over to the newly formed Pac-10. Snowden could not sustain success in the Pac-10, however, finishing no higher than 4th place in the conference. His 9–18 final season led U of A to look for a replacement.\nKnown for his high-octane offense and remembered as a trailblazer, Fred \"The Fox\" Snowden brought excitement to Arizona basketball during his 10-year tenure as the program's head coach. Snowden, who led the Wildcats from 1972 to 1982, was the first African-American head basketball coach at an NCAA Division I institution, amassing a 167–108 mark. The 1973 Western Athletic Conference Coach of the Year, his career winning percentage of .607 has been topped by only three U of A coaches since 1924. Nicknamed \"The Fox\" due to his cool demeanor, Snowden led Arizona to three postseason berths, including the 1975 National Commissioners’ Invitational Tournament and the 1976 and 1977 NCAA Tournaments. His best season came in 1976, when the Wildcats went 24–9, won the Western Athletic Conference championship and advanced to the NCAA West Regional Final. The Brewton, Ala., native was the head coach who led Arizona into the Pac-10 in the 1978–79 season, guiding the program for its first four seasons in the Conference. Snowden also oversaw the transition into the McKale Center after its opening in 1973. He was inducted into the Arizona Sports Hall of Fame in 1988. Prior to his role at Arizona, Snowden was an assistant coach at Michigan. He also served on the coaching staff of his high school, Northwestern High School in Detroit, Mich., where he coached for five years after attending Wayne State University from 1954 to 1958. Snowden died in 1994 at the age of 57.\nAthletic Director Dave Strack brought in Ben Lindsey to replace Fred Snowden in 1983, and on the surface, it seemed like a reasonable move. Lindsey had junior college expertise, having had a successful career at Grand Canyon University, where he won two national titles. What resulted, however, was nothing short of disaster. The 1983 team finished with the worst season in school history at 4–24, with only one Pac-10 win.\nLute Olson (1983−2007).\nOlson's First class and 1st Final Four.\nNewly hired U of A Athletic director Cedric Dempsey fired Lindsey after only one season and hired University of Iowa coach Lute Olson as his successor. U of A needed a coach with a history of quickly turning around programs, which Olson had done previously at Iowa. \"I knew we had a tremendous amount of work to do\", Olson recalled in a recent interview with Tucson Lifestyle. \"The program was in shambles at that point, after the terrible year before...\"\nUnder Olson, Arizona quickly rose to national prominence. Arizona won its first Pac-10 title in 1986, only three years after his arrival. That season set up an amazing 1987–88 season, which included taking the Great Alaska Shootout championship, the Valley Bank Fiesta Bowl Classic championship and the Pac-10 championship. Under players Steve Kerr, Kenny Lofton, and Sean Elliott, Arizona spent much of the season ranked No. 1 and made their first (and Olson's second) Final Four. While Arizona lost in the Final Four round, their play put the program on the map and launched Arizona's reign as a perennial Pac-10 and NCAA tournament contender. Sean Elliott was awarded the John R. Wooden Award on the season and would set the PAC-10 scoring record.\nThe road to a first championship (1997).\nIn 1997, Arizona defeated the University of Kentucky, the defending national champions, to win the NCAA national championship. Prior to winning the championship in 1997, Arizona stormed back from 10-point deficits in the Southeast Regional First round and Second Round against #13 South Alabama and #12 College of Charleston, respectively winning 65–57 and 73–69. The Southeast Regional semifinal pitted Arizona against overall #1 Kansas (34–1) which had defeated Arizona the year before in the 1996 West Regional semifinal. However, Arizona came out fast and stunned the Jayhawks 85–82, then prevailed in overtime against Providence 96–92 in the Elite Eight to clinch a berth in the Final Four. Arizona then beat #1 seed North Carolina 66–58 in the Final Four, which turned out to be Dean Smith's last game as a coach. Arizona also accomplished the unprecedented feat of beating three number one seeds in the 1997 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. This feat has never been accomplished by another team.\nLater years and 1999 NCAA sanctions under Olson.\nThe year following the Championship season, 1998, Arizona returned all 5 starters (Mike Bibby, Michael Dickerson, Miles Simon, Bennett Davison, and A. J. Bramlett) and were poised to make another run after receiving the #1 overall seed in the West, but were upset by Utah in the Elite 8.\nIn 1999, all 5 starters were lost to graduation or early entry to the NBA draft and Arizona's hopes of continuing its streak of consecutive trips to the NCAA tournament was in jeopardy until senior point guard Jason Terry (the 6th man the previous two seasons) elevated his game (receiving National Player of the Year honors) and continued the school's amazing streak.\nIn 2000, former Wildcat Jason Terry, stated that he received approximately $4,500 in cash, checks and wire transfers from New York sports agent Larry Fox, after his junior season. The NCAA announced that as a result a one-game 1999 NCAA tournament appearance was formally vacated. In addition, Arizona asked Terry to repay the $45,363 in forfeited NCAA 1999 tournament revenue and banned him from the U of A Sports Hall of Fame, including a provision that his jersey would not be retired. Terry's jersey was later retired in 2015.\nNCAA Finalist (2001).\n2001 was one of the most challenging and rewarding years for the program. Lute Olson's wife Bobbi, well known to players and fans alike as a steadfast presence on the sidelines, died of cancer. The team, which had been a preseason pick by many to win the national title had to play without Olson for three weeks while Olson was on bereavement leave. The Cats vowed to dedicate their season to Bobbi. With guard Jason Gardner, center Loren Woods and forward Michael Wright — each an All-American — leading the way, the Cats trounced their opponents, beating Oregon 104–65, devastating USC 105–61, and charging through the Final Four. They took down Eastern Illinois, Butler, Mississippi, Illinois, and Michigan State, only to be stopped by Duke in the title game. While being considered the favorite to win the title, which would have been Coach Olson's 2nd and tied him with Coach Mike Krzyzewski, his opponent, the Blue Devils claimed a ten-point victory in the game. This is the last game Coach Olson ever coached in the Final Four and is considered by fans of the program to be his most bitter defeat. A championship would have vaulted him into hallowed ground among coaches, being one of few with multiple titles. Instead he remains tied with many coaches who have a single championship ring to their name. Meanwhile, his opponent in that game now is in second place among college coaches with five championship rings, behind only John Wooden's ten. All five of Krzyzewski's titles came in the 64 team field era; Wooden none. Still Coach Olson earned the respect of his contemporary, Coach K said in the post-game interview that \"Arizona had a great team and an amazing season and was worthy of winning the championship, let's give a hand to Coach Olson and his team.\" The comment drew rousing applause from the audience in attendance and made Coach Olson proud, even in defeat, to be honored as an equal by Coach Krzyzewski who many claim is the best coach in college history.\nLater years and Further NCAA sanctions under Olson (2002−2008).\nIn his later years at U of A, Olson fielded competitive teams with extremely talented point guards. Continuing the reputation and nickname \"Point Guard U,\" recent standouts include Jason Gardner, Salim Stoudamire, Mustafa Shakur, Jerryd Bayless and Nic Wise. Arizona would win Olson's last Pac-10 title during the 2004–2005 season under the spectacular play of seniors Salim Stoudamire and center Channing Frye. That team also made it to the Elite 8 and the verge of the Final Four before blowing a 15-point lead with four minutes to play and losing in overtime, 90–89, to the No. 1 seed and eventual national runner-up, University of Illinois.\nOlson took an unexplained leave of absence at the beginning of the 2007–2008 season. Assistant coach Kevin O'Neill took over interim head coaching duties for the Arizona Wildcats. At that time, Olson announced that he intended to be back for the 2008–09 season and finish out his contract, which was scheduled to end in 2011. His departure was criticized by some members of the media. They also questioned how he and the U of A athletic department handled his return and the verbal succession agreement with coach O'Neill. However, on October 23, 2008, he unexpectedly announced his retirement from the program (by way of an announcement from Arizona athletic director Jim Livengood). A few days later, Olson's personal physician held a press conference and explained that the retirement was strongly advised due to health concerns.\nAfter Lute Olson's abrupt retirement, Arizona Athletic Director Jim Livengood appointed assistant coach Russ Pennell as the interim head coach for the 2008–2009 season 23 days before the start of the season. The appointment came after Mike Dunlap, the associate head coach brought in to replace Kevin O'Neill, turned down the job. Under Pennell, the Cats finished 19–13 in the regular season, including a non-conference win over Kansas and a 7-game win streak with wins over UCLA and Washington. Despite a 19–13 finish to the season, Arizona was controversially selected as one of the last teams into the field of 65 as a 12th seed in the Midwest region, extending its NCAA consecutive tournament appearances to 25 years. The Cats made it to the Sweet 16 (regional semi-finals) with wins over 5-seed Utah and 13-seed Cleveland State, before falling to overall 1-seed, Louisville. Despite Pennell's post-season success, he was not retained, as Arizona announced before his hiring they would hold a national coaching search after the season ended. (On April 9, 2009, Pennell was hired as head coach of the men's basketball team at Division II Grand Canyon University, a member of the Pacific West Conference.)\nFollowing Olson's retirement, reports of NCAA violations arose regarding payment of impermissible benefits to players and recruiting violations. In response, Arizona self-imposed sanctions that included a reduction in the number of recruiting visits by coaches and prospective players, the disbanding of a booster group, and implementation of a series of administrative and rules changes to prevent further violations. The NCAA upheld most of those self-imposed sanctions but determined the school had used two ineligible players in 2007-08 and would have to vacate all wins involving those players and eliminate their statistics. The NCAA reduced the number of scholarships and visits with recruits Arizona was allowed to make. The NCAA found that Olson failed to promote an atmosphere of compliance at the university but decided against sanctioning the coach because he was retired and had health issues. \"I think that was my fault,\" Olson said during a 2008 interview with ESPN.com. \"That wasn't anyone else's fault. It was my error and it was a big error. But I guess in 26 years you are allowed to make a mistake once in a while anyway and that's not to say I haven't made a lot of them but in terms of that, that was a big mistake on my part.\"\nSean Miller (2009−2021).\nAfter the end of the season, various coaching names were considered to succeed Lute Olson on a permanent basis. Arizona was perceived to have interest in Gonzaga's Mark Few, Pittsburgh's Jamie Dixon and then-Memphis coach John Calipari (before he accepted the vacant position at Kentucky) to take the job. Arizona even brought USC's Tim Floyd on campus for an interview and while Arizona claims no formal offer was ever presented, Floyd ultimately turned down the job publicly.\nFirst season (2009−10).\nArizona hired Sean Miller from Xavier University to fill the head coaching position. He initially turned the job down before changing his mind and accepting the job on Apr. 6, 2009 despite having never visited the Arizona campus. Miller was formally introduced as the 13th head men's basketball coach at Arizona at a press conference on April 7, 2009, at McKale Center. At the press conference, Miller acknowledged Lute Olson's impact on the Arizona program by addressing Olson personally: \"One of the reasons I sit here today is because of the great legacy you built.\" Miller also promised U of A fans that they would enjoy the style of both offense and defense he would bring to Wildcat basketball. Miller's salary is $1.6 million per year; he will receive an additional $400,000 per season from Nike and media contracts during a five-year deal, as well as a $1 million signing bonus and other amenities such as season tickets to other Wildcat sporting events and the use of a private jet. Within three months of joining the program, Miller compiled a strong five-player recruiting class that ranked 13th nationally in 2009. After going 16–15 and missing the NCAA tournament for the first time in 25 years during Miller's initial 2009–10 campaign.\nThree Elite Eights under Miller (2011, 2014−15).\nIn his second season as the head coach at Arizona, the Cats finished the season with 30–8, 14–4 Pac-12 play, behind the play of sophomore Pac-10 Player of the Year Derrick Williams. It would be the Wildcats' first outright Pac-10 regular season title (its 12th overall), 4th 30+ win season (1st overall) and Elite Eight appearance (8th overall) since the 2004–2005 season. In addition, Miller led the Wildcats to their first unbeaten home record (17–0) in 14 years and was named Pac-10 Coach of the Year. This was the first time an Arizona coach received this honor since Lute Olson in 2003. The 17 wins without a loss at home is tied for the second-most in school history. Miller would add to the season's success by guiding the Cats to their first Elite Eight appearance since the 2004–2005 Season as a 5-seed. In the second round, Arizona secured a 2-point victory over 12th seeded Memphis (coached by former Wildcat (and member of the 1997 national title team) Josh Pastner) with a blocked shot in the final seconds by Derrick Williams. Arizona would follow with another close game—a controversial one-point win against 4-seed Texas. In the Sweet-16 match-up, Arizona found itself pitted against top-seeded Duke, the first time since the 2001 title game that the two schools had met. Duke would extend an early lead, but 25 points from Derrick Williams kept the Cats in the game and down by 6 points at the half. In the second half, Williams' teammates picked up the slack, dominating the Blue Devils by scoring 55 second-half points and routing the defending champs 93–77. Arizona's run at the Final Four would fall 2 points short, losing to 3-seed (and eventual national champion) Connecticut 65–63.\nFor his third season, Arizona's 2011 recruiting class was ranked 7th, notably signing Nick Johnson and Josiah Turner. Arizona secured three players in the top nine of the ESPNU 100, with all four newly signed players within the top 36. This has cemented Arizona as the No. 1 signing class nationally, surpassing Kentucky who held the No. 1 spot 2010 and 2011. The Wildcats missed the postseason for the second time, reached to the NIT Tournament before falling to Bucknell to finish the season 23–12 overall, 12–6 in Pac-12.\nIn his fourth season, Miller guided to its second top-5 ranking in the AP poll (the first coming in weeks 7–10 of the 2012–2013 season), Arizona reached the Sweet 16 in 2013 falling to Ohio State, finished the season with 27–8, 12–6 in Pac-12.\nIn his fifth season with the most talent Coach Miller has had since arriving in Tucson. On December 9, 2013, Arizona became the #1 ranked Team in the Country for the 6th time in school history, after a 9–0 start with wins over traditional national powerhouses Duke and UNLV. The Wildcats followed this up by securing a key come-from-behind victory on the road at Michigan on December 14 and led the Wildcats to their second outright Pac-12 Regular Season Title (its 13th overall, 26th regular season overall) in Sean Miller's fifth year as the head coach. Arizona reached the second unbeaten home record at (18–0), Coach Miller again named the second Pac-10/12 coach of the year, 5th 30+ wins season (2nd overall), 2nd Elite Eight appearance (9th overall) in 2014. But in the 2014 NCAA tournament, the Wildcats would fall to Wisconsin in overtime, they finish the season with 33–5, 15–3 in Pac-12.\nIn his sixth season as the Arizona Wildcats basketball head coach, after Gonzaga's home loss to BYU on February 28, 2015, Arizona claimed the longest active home winning streak in D-I men's college basketball (38th home win at 2nd all-time, 82nd home win at 5th all-time). Arizona defeated #13 Utah in Salt Lake City the same day, winning its share of the Pac-12 regular season title. After three losses to Pac-12 archrival Arizona State, Oregon State and UNLV, Arizona won their third Pac-12 regular season championship title (2nd straight year, its 14th overall, 27th overall). Arizona reached the third unbeaten home record at (17–0). The Wildcats completes their sixth ever 30+ win (3rd overall) and won their first Pac-12 Tournament title (5th overall) since 2002. In the 2015 NCAA tournament, the Wildcats fell to the Wisconsin Badgers in Elite Eight, 85–78, and finished the season 34–4, 16–2 in the Pac-12.\nIn his seventh season, they finished the season 25–9, 12–6 in Pac-12 play to tie with California for third place. They defeated Colorado in the quarterfinals of the Pac-12 Tournament to advance to the semifinals where they lost to Oregon. In the 2016 NCAA Tournament, as a 6-seed in the South Region. They lost in the first round to Wichita State.\nIn his eighth season at U of A, AP polls &amp; 81-straight coaches polls. The 97-consecutive weeks in the AP poll is currently the second-longest streak in the nation behind Kansas at 161 weeks.[1] They have been ranked every week in the 2016–2017 season, bringing those totals to 97 weeks for the AP &amp; 100 weeks for the coaches poll. Arizona won its first 10 conference games, the best start since the '97-'98 season when they started 16–0. They finished the season at seventh ever 30+ wins with 32–5, tied at 16–2 with Oregon in Pac-12 play for first place to win their 3rd Pac-12 regular season championship title for the 15th time (28th overall). The Wildcats entered the Pac-12 Tournament as a 2-seed, the Wildcats defeated 7-seed Colorado in the quarterfinals, 3-seed UCLA in the semifinals and 1-seed Oregon in the championship game, Wildcats won their 2nd Pac-12 Tournament championship title for the 6th time. In the 2017 NCAA Tournament, as a 2-seed in the West regional, Arizona defeated the 15-seed North Dakota 100–82 in the first round, 7-seed Saint Mary's 69–60 in the second round and losing to Xavier 71–73 in the Sweet Sixteen.\nLater seasons, 2021 Post-season ban, 2017−2018 NCAA sanctions under Miller (2018−2021).\nAs Miller's ninth season as the head coach at Arizona was about to get underway, federal prosecutors announced, on September 26, 2017, bribery, soliciting a bribe and wire fraud charges against assistant coach Emanuel \"Book\" Richardson as part of a far-reaching, college basketball-wide scandal. Perhaps in part due to the ongoing scandal, the Wildcats ranked No. 2 in the country at one point, lost three games at the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament. Arizona would eventually fire Richardson for his role in the scandal and the team would recover to lead the Pac 12 for the majority of the season. On February 24, 2018, Associate head coach Lorenzo Romar was temporarily named head coach after news broke the previous day that Miller had been caught on an FBI wiretap offering to pay players to come to Arizona. On March 1, Miller held a joint press conference with the university denying all allegations and stating he would be retained as men's head basketball coach. That same night, the Wildcats won their 29th regular season conference title, 16th in the Pac-12, and secured the No. 1 seed in the conference tournament by defeating Stanford 75–67. On March 10, Arizona defeated USC to win a record seventh conference tournament title. As a result, the Wildcats received an automatic bid to their sixth straight NCAA tournament (35th NCAA tournament appearance, 12th all time) as the No. 4 seed in the South regional. The Wildcats, a trendy pick to make the Final Four and win the championship were blown out in the first round by No. 13 seed Buffalo, losing 89–68.\n2018–2019 marked the tenth season for Sean Miller as the Arizona Wildcats head coach. Arizona replaced all 5 starting players, 3 via the NBA draft. After a victory against UTEP, Miller recorded his 250th win for Arizona (370th win overall), in only 324 games, which was the 5th fastest of any coach at any Division 1 program all-time. On January 5, 2019, Arizona won its 600th game in the McKale center with an 84–81 overtime victory over Utah. Arizona became the first Pac-12 team to achieve 100 wins against conference opponents since the conference expanded to 12 teams before the 2011 season, after defeating Stanford 75−70 Jan. 9, 2019. The Wildcats would go on to finish the season in Pac-12 play 8–10, 9th place overall &amp; lose their first round Pac-12 Tournament match up against USC, 65−78. They would end the season with an overall record of 17–15 &amp; decline an invitation to the CBI.\n2019–2020 marked the eleventh season for Sean Miller as the Arizona Wildcats head coach. Despite again losing all 5 starting players, Arizona would bring in the 6th overall best recruiting class &amp; ranked pre-season 21st by the AP Poll. Arizona would open the season 9–0, capped off by winning the Wooden Legacy tournament located in Anaheim, California led by tournament MVP Nico Mannion &amp; defeated Wake Forest 73–66. Arizona finished non-conference play ranked 16th with an overall record of 10–3. On February 1, 2020, Miller would win his 400th overall game of his career in a 75−70 over USC to move their record to 16–6 &amp; 6–3 in conference play. They would defeat Stanford in Maples Pavilion for the conferences longest active streak 20th time, 69–60. Arizona would finish the regular season with an overall record of 20–11 &amp; 10–8 in conference play, which was good for 5th. The Wildcats would face 12 seed Washington in their first-round match up &amp; win 77–70, to set up a second-round matchup versus 4 seed USC. The season would end due to the COVID-19 Pandemic which shut down sports globally &amp; end the 2019–20 season. Arizona would have an overall record 21–11 &amp; were a projected 7 seed but could have moved higher pending the remainder of the Pac-12 tournament.\nIn 2020–21, Arizona would begin its twelfth season under Head Coach Sean Miller. The Pac-12 announced before the season started that schools would not allow for fans to be in attendance due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also due to travel restrictions, financial impact &amp; COVID-19 testing, Arizona was forced to cancel non-conference match ups against pre-season top 5 teams, Gonzaga &amp; Illinois, as well as cancel their appearance in the 2020 NIT Season Tip-Off in Brooklyn against top 15 ranked Texas Tech, Cincinnati &amp; St. John's. In total Arizona would have 14 games cancelled, postponed or rescheduled but none of which were due to COVID-19 issues within the Arizona Wildcat program.\nThis season also marked the introduction of expanded Pac-12 play with each team adding two games, one home &amp; one road, during the months of November &amp; December for a total of 20 with the Wildcats adding games at home against Colorado &amp; on the road against Stanford. Arizona again would replace the entire starting 5 for a third straight season but bring in another top 10 recruiting class, 7th overall led by six international players from Canada, Estonia, France, Lithuania &amp; Turkey, as well as the United States. Arizona would finish non-conference play with an overall record of 6–0 against its opponents. Arizona would lose its opening Pac-12 game against Stanford 75–78 which would snap the Wildcats' 20-game winning streak against the Cardinal.\nFollowing 88–74 victory over Colorado, the Wildcats' announced a Self-Imposed one-year postseason ban, which included the 2021 Pac-12 tournament.\nOn February 20, Sean Miller would win his 300th game at Arizona in only his 408th, 3rd fastest for any coach at any Pac-12 school by defeating the #17 USC Trojans by a score of 81–72. During the halftime of match up against Washington, Arizona would induct former players Ernie McCray (1958–60) &amp; Al Fleming (1972–76) as the 26th &amp; 27th members of the program's Ring of Honor. Arizona would end the season with an overall record of 17–9 overall and finish 5th in the conference at 11–9 but because of their self-imposed ban would not participate in the conference tournament. Many bracketologists stated that Arizona would have been an NCAA tournament team if not for the self-imposed ban.\nIn March 2021, a Notice of Allegations from the NCAA, originally issued in October 2020 at the conclusion of the NCAA's initial investigation, was released to the media by the university after a lawsuit was filed by ESPN; the school received five Level I violations, considered the NCAA's most serious, one specifically against Miller for failing to monitor his assistant coaches accused of academic misconduct and other rules violations. None of the allegations included anything regarding former player Deandre Ayton.\nOn April 7, 2021, Arizona fired Sean Miller after 12 years. Miller at the time had finished his coaching career with an overall record of 302–109, five regular–season Pac-12 championships, three conference tournament titles &amp; seven NCAA appearances. His 302 wins were the 3rd most in school history. The NCAA along with the IARP would vacate 32 wins from the 2016–17 season and 18 wins from the 2017–18 season, for a total of 50 wins. It would bring his all-time record to 252–109 and his 252 wins would remain the 3rd most in school history.\nTommy Lloyd (2021−present).\nAfter the university decided to part ways with Sean Miller, various coaching names were considered to succeed him on a permanent basis. Three former Wildcats who played under Lute Olson – Damon Stoudamire (head coach at the University of the Pacific), Miles Simon (assistant for the Los Angeles Lakers), and Josh Pastner (head coach at Georgia Tech), as well as Arkansas' Eric Musselman, were under speculation to take the job. On April 14, 2021, it was announced that Tommy Lloyd, the longtime top assistant coach at Gonzaga under Mark Few, would become the 18th head coach of Arizona men's basketball. Both Lloyd and Few have been heavily influenced by the European style of basketball (and a focus on recruiting international players), as well as the uptempo, player-focused offense as implemented at Arizona under Lute Olson. A formal press conference was held at McKale Center on April 15 to introduce Lloyd as the head coach. Coach Lloyd got his first victory as a head coach versus the Wildcats' in-state rival Northern Arizona 81–52. His 29-point victory versus NAU was the second largest margin in a coach's debut in school history &amp; largest since 1915. He would win his first Pac-12 game on December 12, 2021, against Oregon State, 90–65. Coach Lloyd &amp; Arizona would go on to lose their first game of his career &amp; season in Knoxville, 73–77 against no. 19 Tennessee.\nThe Wildcats would finish the regular season undefeated on their home court at McKale Center for the 2021–22 campaign, one of only five programs in the nation to do so. The Wildcats would be led by sophomore guards Bennedict Mathurin, Kerr Kriisa and Dalen Terry, as well as junior center Christian Koloko and sophomore forward Ąžuolas Tubelis. Coach Lloyd &amp; the Wildcats would win their 1st regular season conference title under Lloyd &amp; 17th overall as a program with a 91–71 road win over USC. In the season finale Arizona would defeat California 89–61, becoming the first program &amp; coach to win 18 conference games in the Pac-12 in one season. Arizona clinched the top seed in the 2022 Pac-12 tournament; they would go on to defeat No. 9 seed Stanford 84–80, No. 4 seed Colorado 82–72 &amp; No. 2 seed (No. 16 in the AP poll) UCLA 84–76 to win their 8th overall conference tournament title &amp; Coach Tommy Lloyd's 1st. Following the end of the Pac-12 season Lloyd was named Pac-12 Coach of the Year. Arizona finished the Pac-12 portion of the season with a 31–3 record, earning a number 2 ranking in both the AP &amp; coaches poll. Following the Pac-12 tournament title win, Arizona was selected as the second overall number 1 seed in the South Regional of the 2022 March Madness Tournament where they would go on to play 16 seed Wright State in their first round matchup. Arizona reached its 20th \"Sweet 16\" by defeating TCU in overtime 85–80. The Wildcats' season would end with a Sweet 16 loss to Houston 72–60. Lloyd was named as a finalists for the Naismith Award. Following the end of the season Coach Lloyd won the AP Coach of the Year, NABC Coach of the Year &amp; USBWA Coach of the Year.\nArizona would begin the 2022–23 Season by winning the 2022 Maui Invitational Tournament by defeating Cincinnati, No. 17 San Diego State, No. 10 Creighton as well as non-conference games against No. 14 Indiana in the Las Vegas Clash &amp; No. 6 Tennessee in McKale. Arizona &amp; Coach Lloyd would end the non-conference part of the schedule with a record of 12–0. Lloyd would become the fastest coach to 50 wins, doing so in 57 games, with a 58–52 win over their rival No. 5 UCLA, it was Arizona's 5th win over a ranked team during the season. Arizona would end the season losing to their rival in Los Angeles, 73–82, giving them an overall record of 25–6 &amp; 14–6 in conference play. They would enter postseason play ranked No. 8 overall &amp; the No. 2 in the 2023 Pac-12 Tournament in Las Vegas. Arizona defeated No. 10 seed Stanford Cardinal 95–84, which was his 59th career win, the most of any head coach to start their coaching career. Arizona defeated Arizona State in the Semifinals, 78–59. Arizona then defeated rivals UCLA 61–59 to win Arizona's ninth conference tournament title overall, and the second title in a row. Arizona earned a No. 2 seed in the South Region of the 2023 NCAA Tournament, with a first round match up against Ivy League Champion and No. 15 seed Princeton. Arizona was upset 55–59, ending their season with an overall record of 28–7.\nArizona began the 3rd season under Lloyd ranked No. 12 in the preseason AP Poll. They had several non-conference match ups against ranked opponents defeating No. 2 Duke at Cameron Indoor Stadium 78–73, No. 21 Michigan State 74–68, No. 21 Wisconsin 98–73, suffered defeats against No. 3 Purdue 84–92 and No. 14 Florida Atlantic 95–96. The Wildcats entered Pac-12 play with a 9–2 record and were ranked No. 4 in the country but suffered their first conference loss on the road against unranked Stanford 82–100. Arizona would go on to sweep the season series against rivals Arizona State and UCLA, finish the regular season with a record of 24–7(15–5) to win their 18th Pac-12 regular season title. Caleb Love won the schools 11th overall Pac-12 Player of the Year and was named second and third team all-American. Arizona lost their semifinal matchup in the Pac-12 tournament against eventual winners Oregon 59–67. Arizona earned a second straight No. 2 seed in the West Region of the 2024 NCAA Tournament, with a first round matchup against Big West Champion and No. 15 seed Long Beach State. Arizona defeated Long Beach 85–66 in the round of 64, defeated No. 7 Dayton 78–68 to reach their second Sweet Sixteen in three years but lost to No. 6 Clemson 72–77 ending their season with an overall record of 27–9. Coach Lloyd was one win shy of tying Brad Stevens record of 89 wins in a head coaches first three years as head coach. This would also mark Arizona's 50th and final season as members of the Pac-12 Conference, as they will move to the Big 12 Conference to start the 2024-25 season.\nSeason by season results.\nUnder Tommy Lloyd\nRivalries.\nArizona State.\nSince Arizona State became a University on December 5, 1958, Arizona leads ASU 81–58.

The UCLA-Arizona basketball rivalry is still seen as the match up of the two premier teams in the conference. Also, the performance of the two schools influences the national opinion of the conference. California Coach Mike Montgomery has stated, \"...If those two are not good, the conference is not perceived as being good. People don't give credit to the schools across the board in the league.\" Since the mid-1980s, Arizona has also had a basketball rivalry with UCLA, as the two schools competed for the Pac-10 Championship every year.

        "text": "The Syracuse Orange men's basketball program is an intercollegiate men's basketball team representing Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York. The program is classified in the NCAA Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and the team competes in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).\nSyracuse is considered one of the most prestigious college basketball programs in the country with 3 overall claimed National Championships and 1 NCAA Tournament championship, as well being a National Runner-up 2 times. Syracuse is ranked sixth in total victories among all NCAA Division I programs and seventh in all-time win percentage among programs with at least 50 years in Division I, with an all-time win–loss record of 2042–931† () as of March 29, 2021. The Orange are also sixth in NCAA Tournament appearances (41), seventh in NCAA Tournament victories (70†), and seventh in Final Four appearances (6).\nThe Orange play their home games at the JMA Wireless Dome, referred to as the JMA Dome. The JMA Wireless Dome is the largest arena in NCAA DI basketball with a maximum capacity of 35,642. Syracuse's home court total attendance has led the nation 25 times, and its per-game season average attendance has been ranked first 14 times since the opening of the Carrier Dome in 1980. The most recent record-breaking game was against Duke in 2019 with the crowd of 35,642 people. The JMA Dome is often considered one of the best home court advantages in college basketball.\nUnder former head coach Jim Boeheim, 10 Big East regular season championships, 5 Big East tournament championships, 35 NCAA tournament appearances (and 41 all-time), and 3 appearances in the national title game. \nIn 2015, after a lengthy investigation, the NCAA's Committee on Infractions ordered Syracuse to vacate 101 wins from five different seasons; however, the NCAA confirmed that sanctions did not include the removal of any trophies or banners, and Syracuse claims all of its NCAA Tournaments appearances and conference titles from those years. The investigation required Syracuse to vacate 79 wins from the 2006, 2007, and 2012 seasons, ending their former record of 46 current consecutive winning seasons.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nBasketball started at Syracuse in February 1898 and Athletic Director John A. R. Scott served as the first coach. Syracuse fielded its first varsity basketball team in 1916–17. The program rose to national prominence early in its history, being recognized by the Helms Athletic Foundation as national champions for 1918 (under Coach Edmund Dollard) and 1926. The program made National Invitation Tournament appearances in 1946 and 1950, won the 1951 National Campus Tournament, and made its first NCAA men's basketball tournament appearance in 1957. Notable early era players included Hall of Famer Vic Hanson and racial pioneer Wilmeth Sidat-Singh.\nNational emergence.\nThe modern era of Syracuse basketball began with the arrival of future Hall of Famer Dave Bing. As a sophomore in 1964, Bing led the team to an NIT appearance and as a senior in 1966, he led the team to its second NCAA tournament appearance, where it reached the regional final. Bing's backcourt partner on these teams was future Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim.\nSyracuse remained competitive after Bing's departure, with NIT appearances in 1967, 1971, and 1972. Under coach Roy Danforth, in 1973, the team began a string of consecutive NCAA appearances highlighted by a Final Four appearance in 1975. The 1975 squad featured guard Jim Lee and forward Rudy Hackett and was affectionately known as \"Roy's Runts.\"\nBig East era (1979–2013).\nJim Boeheim Takeover.\nFollowing the 1976 season, Danforth was hired away by Tulane University and the university turned to young assistant Jim Boeheim (a native of Lyons, New York) to assume the helm. Boeheim extended the string of NCAA appearances to nine, with bids in each of his first four seasons, a period in which his teams won 100 games. These teams featured star forward Louis Orr and center Roosevelt Bouie, and were sometimes referred to as the \"Louie and Bouie Show.\"\nA new conference.\nSyracuse was a founding member of the Big East Conference in 1979, along with UConn, Georgetown University, St. John's University and Providence College. Syracuse and Georgetown were each ranked in the top ten in 1980, and a new and major rivalry blossomed when Georgetown snapped Syracuse's 57-game home winning streak in the final men's basketball game played at Manley Field House. Over the next ten seasons, these two schools met eight times in the Big East tournament, four times in the finals, and met numerous times on national television during the regular season.\nSyracuse won the Big East tournament in 1981, but was passed over by the NCAA Tournament. The team, featuring Danny Schayes and Leo Rautins, finished runner-up in the NIT. The team returned to the NIT in 1982, before beginning another extended streak of NCAA appearances in 1983.\nThe Pearl.\nIn 1983, heralded high school phenomenon Dwayne \"Pearl\" Washington joined the team, and led the school to NCAA appearances in 1984, 1985, and 1986, before leaving school early for the NBA draft.\nWashington grew up in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, New York, where he acquired his nickname as an eight-year-old in a taunting comparison to Earl \"the Pearl\" Monroe. He was a playground phenomenon from Boys and Girls High School in Brooklyn, and was rated as the number one overall high school player in the United States 1983. He brought his flashy play to Syracuse University and the Carrier Dome. \"The Pearl\" was the master of the \"shake and bake\" and the \"cross-over\" moves.\nIt is believed that Pearl Washington brought Syracuse basketball to national prominence and helped usher the Big East into the national spotlight in the mid-1980s. In the Carrier Dome's first three years, Syracuse's highest attendance mark was a mere 20,401 in the 1982–83. In 1983, Pearl's freshman year, Syracuse's attendance increased to 22,380 per game. As a sophomore, Syracuse led the nation in attendance for the first time in school history. Syracuse would be the NCAA's attendance leader for the next ten years. By the time Washington was a junior, Syracuse's average attendance had jumped to 26,225. Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim, who has long said that there would be no Syracuse basketball program as we know it without Pearl, he once said:\"He's the only guy who could just overnight fill the place like that. He had an unbelievable effect on our program. Everybody says that Patrick Ewing and Chris Mullin made the Big East, but I think Pearl made the league. They were the best players, but Pearl was the player that people turned out to see and turned on their TVs to watch. We had the highest-rated games every year that Pearl was here. He was a guy who everybody wanted to see play. He not only helped make our program, he helped make the Big East and he helped college basketball.\"\nIn 2016, at the December 17 Georgetown game, joined alongside Washington's family, friends and former teammates, SU Director of Athletics John Wildhack helped unveil the No. 31 logo at center court to honor Washington. Washington died from brain cancer earlier that year eight months after being diagnosed. Washington has a street named after him in the Brownsville section of his native Brooklyn, New York.\nFalling just short.\nDespite the early loss of Washington, Syracuse returned to the NCAAs in 1987, with a team featuring Rony Seikaly, Sherman Douglas and freshman Derrick Coleman, reaching the National Championship game before losing, 74–73, in the final to Indiana on a last-second jump shot by Keith Smart. Led by Coleman, Douglas, Seikaly, Stephen Thompson and Billy Owens, the school extended its string of NCAA appearances to 10 seasons before that string was broken in 1993, due to NCAA sanctions resulting from an incident involving a booster.\nLed by guard Lawrence Moten and forward John Wallace, the school returned to the NCAAs in 1994 and 1995. In 1996, Wallace led the team to its third Final Four appearance and second National Championship game, where it played impressively before losing, 76–67, to a heavily favored Kentucky team that included nine future NBA players (Kentucky head coach Rick Pitino had been an assistant coach to Boeheim in 1976, 1977).\nA new millennium dawns.\nThe 1997 squad won 19 games but was bypassed by the NCAA tournament and appeared in the NIT. The 1998, 1999, and 2000 squads featuring guard Jason Hart and center Etan Thomas all earned NCAA bids. In 2000, the university also named its All-Century Team, recognizing its greatest players of the 20th century and the school's first 100 years of basketball. The team made a fourth consecutive NCAA appearance in 2001, but returned to the NIT in 2002, despite having a 20-win season. This marked the first time a school with 20 wins from the Big East Conference was denied a bid to the NCAA Tournament.\nChampions at last.\nAlthough unranked in the preseason polls for the 2002–03 season, led by freshmen Carmelo Anthony, Gerry McNamara and sophomore Hakim Warrick, the Orangemen won their first NCAA tournament championship with an 81–78 defeat of the University of Kansas in the final. Anthony was named NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player.\nAfter the crown.\nAnthony left for the NBA draft after the school year, but McNamara and Warrick stayed on, leading the team to NCAA bids in 2004 and 2005. The latter season saw Syracuse introduce a new nickname, dropping \"Orangemen\" and \"Orangewomen\" in favor of \"Orange\".In 2006, McNamara would lead the Orange to an extremely unexpected Big East Championship victory, making the ninth-seeded Orange the lowest seed to ever win the championship and only the third school to repeat as Big East tournament champions, but was immediately defeated in the opening round of the 2006 NCAA tournament by Texas A&amp;M, 66–58.\nThe 2007–08 season for the Orange was up and down. The Orange had a 50-point win over East Tennessee State on December 15, the largest margin of victory in 20 seasons. They recorded top-25 wins over Georgetown and Marquette. But the team lost to Villanova in the Big East tournament opening round, and to UMass in the NIT. UMass became the first team ever to beat the Orange twice in the same season at the Carrier Dome.\nIn the 2008–09 season Syracuse was led by sophomore guard Jonny Flynn. The team returned key players like Eric Devendorf, Andy Rautins, Rick Jackson, Arinze Onuaku and Paul Harris. Syracuse gained a tremendous amount of media attention following a 127–117 upset of UConn in six overtimes during the early morning hours of March 13, 2009 \"the Game that wouldn't end\" to advance to the semifinals of the Big East Conference tournament. This game solidified their seeding in the 2009 NCAA tournament. This game was the second longest of any game in NCAA History and only the fourth to make it into six overtimes. However, they lost in the Big East Final. Syracuse received a 3 seed and beat Stephen F. Austin 59–44 in the first round. Syracuse stamped its ticket to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2004, defeating sixth seed Arizona State 78–67. However, the season ended with a loss to No. 2 seed Oklahoma, as the Sooners ended the Orange's season with an 84–71 loss.\nAt the start of the 2009–10 season, having lost three key players (Devendorf, Flynn, Harris) from the previous season, the Orange was not considered a top contender, unranked in the preseason AP Poll. An early exhibition game loss to local LeMoyne College, a Division II school, did little to improve the outlook. However, led by its starters, returning seniors Andy Rautins and Arinze Onuaku, junior Rick Jackson, a relatively unknown transfer from Iowa State University, forward Wes Johnson, freshman point guard Brandon Triche, plus standout reserve players, sophomores Kris Joseph and Scoop Jardine, the team began to deliver, winning its first 13 regular season games. By the second week of rankings, the Orange had climbed into the top ten, staying in the top five continuously from week 9. Syracuse reached a number one ranking two weeks before the season ended, finishing the season in fourth place with its best-ever regular season win–loss performance, at 28–3. It finished on top of the Big East for the regular season, losing in the Big East tournament's quarter finals. A 1-seed in the West Region of the 2010 NCAA tournament, the Orange fell in the Sweet Sixteen to 5-seed and AP #11 Butler to end the season 30–5.\nSenior Big East Defensive player of the Year Rick Jackson and Juniors Kris Joseph and Scoop Jardine led the 2010–2011 Orange. Syracuse started strong by winning their first 18 contests before losing in Pittsburgh. That loss started a slide for the Orange, who lost six of their next eight games. The Orange regained their momentum by beating the West Virginia Mountaineers to start a six-game winning streak before losing in overtime to the Connecticut Huskies in the semi-finals of the Big East tournament. With a record of 28–7, the Orange garnered a #3 seed in the East Region of the NCAA tournament. The Orange easily handled Indiana State 77–60 in their first game. The Orange faced Marquette in the second round when one of the tournament's more controversial moments occurred. With the game tied at 59 with 51 seconds left, a backcourt violation was called on the Orange when Scoop Jardine retrieved Dion Waiters' inbound pass with one foot landing in the front court before his second settled in the backcourt. NCAA officiating coordinator John Adams admitted the call was made in error however; the officials were unaware of the full rule. According to the 2010 and 2011 NCAA Men's and Women's Basketball Rulebook, Rule 4, Section 3, Article 8 states: \"After a jump ball or during a throw-in, the player in his/her front court, who makes the initial touch on the ball while both feet are off the playing court, may be the first to secure control of the ball and land with one or both feet in the back court. It makes no difference if the first foot down was in the front court or back court.\" Marquette guard Darius Johnson-Odom hit a three-pointer on the ensuing possession with 27 second left to give the Golden Eagles the lead for good and a spot to the Sweet Sixteen. The loss culminated a season in which SU remained undefeated outside of their conference for the first time in the program's history.\n2012–13 was the school's last season in the Big East Conference. Led by sophomore point guard Michael Carter-Williams and Junior forward C.J. Fair, the team made its fifth trip to the Final Four.\nAtlantic Coast Conference era (2013 – present).\nOn July 1, 2013, Syracuse, Notre Dame and Pittsburgh joined the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). In its first season in the conference, Syracuse started 25–0 before losing six of its last nine games. The team featured two Second Team All Americans, point guard Tyler Ennis and forward C.J. Fair, and finished second in the ACC regular season standings.\nThe Orange underperformed 2014–15 expectations with an 18–13 record behind First Team All-ACC center Rakeem Christmas. Though the team was not eligible for the NCAA tournament due to the self-imposed post-season ban by the university, this would change in the following 2015–16 season as the Orange made the Final Four as a 10-seed by defeating Dayton, Middle Tennessee, Gonzaga, and Virginia.\nThe following season Syracuse started ranked 19th in the AP Poll, but failed to make the NCAA tournament. In the 2017–18 season Syracuse would return to the NCAA tournament despite going 8–10 in conference play. In the tournament Syracuse upset 3-seeded Michigan State before losing to Duke in the Sweet 16. The next year saw the Orange make back-to-back NCAA tournament appearances for the first time since the 2013–14 season. They lost to Baylor in the opening round. On January 14, 2019, Syracuse upset Duke in Cameron Indoor Stadium, marking the first time that the Blue Devils had lost to an unranked team at home as the AP ranked number one team. They would lose to Baylor in the opening round of the NCAA tournament. Syracuse started the 2019–20 season slow, losing 48–34 to Virginia, the lowest amount ever scored by a team in Boeheim's career. SU would win its final game of the season in the ACC tournament beating North Carolina 81–53 and defeating the Tar Heels for the first time since 2014. This would be the last game played due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 2020–21 season SU would once again upset its way to the Sweet 16 beating 3-seeded West Virginia before losing to eventual Final Four participant Houston.\nSyracuse University Athletics scandal.\nThe NCAA's investigation into violations by Syracuse athletics date back to May 2007, following an initial report by the university to the NCAA, after the university learned that local YMCA employees paid some football and men's basketball student-athletes; Syracuse claims \"the NCAA’s investigation of Syracuse has taken longer than any other investigation in NCAA history.\"\nIn March 2015, the NCAA released its infractions report which found that Syracuse had possibly violated rules. As a result, 101 wins were vacated by the NCAA in the 2004–2005, 2006–2007, 2010–2011, and 2011–2012 seasons.\nThe NCAA's ruling was confirmed by David Worlock, the NCAA's director of media coordination and statistics. Worlock is not part of the NCAA's Infractions or Enforcement offices. As the director of media coordination and statistics, he is working to update records based on the Committee on Infractions' sanctions. He said the COI's report on Syracuse differed from other investigations into violations at other schools in that it did not require the removal of championship trophies or banners signifying NCAA tournament appearances.\nAs a result, Syracuse retained the banner for its 2012 team's run to the NCAA Elite 8 and 2011 advancement to the third round of the NCAA tournament. Also, a Big East Conference official confirmed that the conference's updated media guide continues to list Syracuse as its 2005 and 2006 tournament champion.\nFacilities.\nArchbold Gymnasium.\nSyracuse home games in the early years were played at Archbold Gymnasium, an on-campus gym that is still used for various university activities. It was built in 1908 with money donated by John Dustin Archbold, a major benefactor of the university, who also funded the building of Archbold Stadium, just to the west of the gymnasium (now the site of the Carrier Dome). After a 1947 fire, most home games were played at Syracuse's state fairgrounds' Coliseum and other local venues from 1947 to 1949.\nManley Field House.\nIn 1962, home games moved to the newly constructed Manley Field House which finally gave the team a powerful home court advantage. At one time, the arena held 9,500 people for home games. The team became so fond of the space that its coaches objected to moving to the Carrier Dome when it was opened in 1980.\nOn February 13, 1980, the Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team upset #2 ranked Syracuse 52–50 in the final planned, regular season game at Manley Field House, where the Orange boasted a 57-game home winning streak. Georgetown head coach John Thompson Jr. would declare after the victory during the news conference that \"Manley Field House is officially closed\". The game gave birth to a rivalry, not just between schools but between two contrasting future Hall of Fame coaches.\nManley Field House hosted the ECAC Upstate Region tournament organized by the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) in 1976 as well as a semifinal game of the 1977 ECAC South Region tournament.\nMelo Center.\nThe Carmelo K. Anthony Basketball Center is the home of Syracuse basketball. The $19 million facility officially opened in September 2009. The facility includes two NCAA regulation-size practice courts, a weight room, training room, equipment room, locker rooms and coaches offices for both men's and women's basketball programs. In addition, fans can relive some of the greatest moments in Syracuse basketball history in the building's Hall of Fame Wing. The name comes from NBA star forward Carmelo Anthony, who was the major benefactor to the project.\nHome court.\nThe JMA Wireless Dome.\nBecause the Carrier Dome could not survive on a schedule of just 6 home football games a year, Syracuse Orange basketball team moved to their new home arena. In its setup for basketball, the Carrier Dome can hold crowds of more than 30,000 for its biggest games.\nThe Carrier Dome is the largest arena in NCAA DI basketball with a maximum capacity of 35,642. Syracuse's home court total attendance has led the nation 28 times, and its per-game average attendance has been ranked first 17 times since the opening of the Carrier Dome in 1980. Also, Syracuse has set and broken the NCAA on campus single game attendance record at the Carrier Dome 16 times. The most recent record-breaking game was against Duke in 2019 with a sellout crowd of 35,642 people.\nIn May 2018, the university announced a major renovation to the Carrier Dome as the central portion of a larger campus update. The renovation, estimated to cost $120 million, is expected to be completed in 2022. The most significant changes will be the replacement of the current air-supported roof with a fixed roof, two-thirds of which will be translucent, the installation of air conditioning and the largest centerhung videoboard in college sports. The upgrade will also include a new lighting and sound systems, Wi-Fi improvements, accessibility upgrades, improved restrooms, and new concession spaces.\nMadison Square Garden.\nThe Orange have been playing at Madison Square Garden, since an encounter with Manhattan on February 1, 1939. The 2018–19 season marked the 37th consecutive campaign that Syracuse played at least once in the facility. The latest streak began in 1983–84. \nRivalries.\nThe original Big East was founded by seven charter schools in 1979 (Providence, St. John's, Georgetown, Syracuse, Seton Hall, Connecticut, and Boston College). Villanova joined the following year, followed by Pittsburgh in 1982. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Georgetown, Villanova, St. John's, and Syracuse were the primary powers in the conference with UConn joining them in the 1990s. In less than a decade since its inception, the Big East became the most successful college basketball league in America. The documentary \"30 for 30: Requiem For The Big East\" by ESPN Films chronicles well the meteoric ascension of the Big East conference.\nSyracuse and Georgetown rivalry.\nSyracuse and Georgetown rivalry — Syracuse's biggest rival is Georgetown. The two schools have been playing each other since 1930, but their rivalry was solidified in the 1980s as the respective programs were the leading powers during the infancy of the newly formed Big East conference. On February 13, 1980, the Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team upset #2 ranked Syracuse 52–50 in the final planned, regular season game at Manley Field House, where the Orange boasted a 57-game home winning streak. Georgetown head coach John Thompson Jr. would declare after the victory during the news conference that \"Manley Field House is officially closed\". The game gave birth to a rivalry, not just between schools but between two contrasting future Hall of Fame coaches.\nGeorgetown–Syracuse rivalry has given the fans numerous memorable moments such as Michael Graham's punch during the Big East tournament at Madison Square Garden in New York City; Pearl Washington's buzzer beater clutch shot to beat defending national champion and #1 team in the country at the Carrier Dome; and coach Thompson's three technical fouls and ejection in the controversial Orange victory.\nThe animosity between the programs was further extended when Syracuse announced their decision to leave the Big East effective in 2013 to join the ACC. Georgetown and Syracuse have continued to play each other in the next years following their exit from the conference.\nThe Georgetown–Syracuse rivalry is regarded as one of college basketball's greatest rivalries between two storied programs.\nSyracuse and Connecticut rivalry.\nThe first game played between the two schools took place on January 27, 1956, while the rivalry was at its height from 1979 to 2013 when both teams were members of the Big East Conference. The rivalry featured two Hall of Fame coaches, Jim Boeheim and Jim Calhoun. One of the highlights was the historic Big East tournament quarterfinal game in 2009, which took place at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Syracuse won 127–117 in a game that went to six overtimes, ending at 1:22 AM.\nSyracuse and Villanova rivalry.\nSyracuse and Villanova rivalry — Both schools have strong basketball traditions and are former Big East rivals. The strength of the basketball rivalry is evidenced by the fact that Syracuse v. Villanova games have attracted some of the biggest college basketball crowds ever, breaking the NCAA on campus basketball attendance record twice, including one game with a crowd of 34,616 people in 2010. However, this rivalry has an uncertain future because of the schools' recent separation (Syracuse in the ACC, and Villanova in the new Big East).\nSyracuse and Duke rivalry.\nSyracuse entered the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in 2013–2014 with the series that year tied 1–1 in two heated and controversial games. In the first, #2 Syracuse (21–0) met expectations by beating Duke in overtime at the Carrier Dome 91–89. The following game at Cameron Indoor Stadium was a 66–60h loss by then #1 Syracuse to Duke in which another questionable set of calls throughout the game culminated in Syracuse player CJ Fair being called for a charge on a possible game-winning play. Jim Boeheim stormed the court, threw his blazer to the ground, was given a technical and ejected. This led to many internet memes, jacket-tossing two foul shots for Duke and an extra possession that sealed the game. This series led to discussions about a possible rivalry shaping up. The teams have swapped wins since then. Some additional notables in the rivalry include a current NCAA basketball attendance record set three times in 2014, 2015 and 2019 seasons at the Carrier Dome and a 2019 upset of #1 Duke by unranked Syracuse at Cameron Indoor Stadium. Interestingly, both coaches are friends. Boeheim and Duke hall-of-fame coach Mike Krzyzewski both coach the USA Olympic Basketball Team, with Boeheim the assistant to Krzyzewski. With Syracuse now in the ACC, the old Big East rivalries are losing steam (occasionally re-kindled by home-and-away series) so time will tell if this replaces them as the predominant rivalry for Syracuse.\nThe Orange lead all-time series with each of their rivals except Duke.\nChampionships.\nNCAA tournament seeding.\n\"The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\"\n\"* played in the \"First Four\" round\"\nComplete NCAA tournament results.\nThe Orange have appeared in the NCAA tournament 39 times. Their combined record is 69–40.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 NCAA tournament was cancelled.\nNIT results.\nThe Orange have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 13 times.\nNational Campus Basketball Tournament results.\nThe Orange appeared in the only National Campus Basketball Tournament where they were champions with a record of 3–0.\nConference tournament titles.\nSince its beginnings in 1898, Syracuse had been independent program until it joined the Big East Conference in 1979. From 1975 to 1982, the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) organized annual regional end-of-season men's basketball tournaments for independent Division I ECAC member colleges and universities in the Northeastern United States. The winner of each regional tournament was declared the ECAC regional champion for the season and received an automatic bid in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. In 2013, Syracuse joined the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nConference regular-season champions.\nSyracuse had been independent program until it joined the Big East Conference in 1979. In 2013, Syracuse joined the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nNational polls.\nSyracuse has finished in the Final Top 25 rankings 30 times in the AP Poll. Syracuse teams have spent a total of 17 weeks ranked number 1, most recently in 2014.\n† The Associated Press \"began compiling a ranking of the top 20 college men's basketball teams during the 1948–1949 season.

Historically, Syracuse University has restricted the men's basketball team from wearing such numbers, but there have also been exceptions to this custom. An example of the former is Carmelo Anthony, who wore #22 in high school, but since the number was already \"retired\" at Syracuse, Anthony chose #15 as an alternate upon his arrival. Similarly, Gerry McNamara wore #31 in high school, also \"retired\" by Syracuse University (McNamara chose #3 instead).\nThe Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nThe Mannie Jackson - Basketball's Human Spirit Award.\nThe award is given annually to an individual who has found the game of basketball to be a contributing aspect to their personal growth and accomplishment, a place to develop an understanding of others, and an avenue that helped shape that individual's growth into a recognized visionary and leader.\nThe Curt Gowdy Media Award.\nThe Basketball Hall of Fame's media award was established by the board of trustees to single out members of the electronic and print media for outstanding contributions to basketball.\nThe NBA 75th Anniversary Team.\nThe NBA 75th Anniversary Team, also referred to as the NBA 75, was chosen in 2021 to honor the 75th anniversary of the founding of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

        "text": "Climbing salamanders is the common name for plethodontid (lungless) salamanders of the genus Aneides. It contains 10 species native to North America, distributed between the Pacific Coast (7 species), Sacramento Mountains (1 species), and Appalachian Mountains (2 species). As their common name suggests, most of these species have prehensile tails and are quite mobile in trees.\nTaxonomy.\nThe green salamander (\"A. aeneus\") and the Hickory Nut Gorge green salamander (\"A. caryaensis\") are now considered to belong to their own subgenus \"Castaneides\", which diverged from the \"Aneides hardii\" lineage between 27.2 and 32.3 million years ago, during the Oligocene. \"Castaneides\" contains significant cryptic diversity and may contain more as-of-yet undescribed species. All other western \"Aneides\" including \"A. hardii\" are considered \"Aneides sensu stricto\", and belong to the subgenus of the same name.\nDistribution.\nAll ten known species in this genus inhabit mountain ecosystems in North America, and all but three are found primarily in the mountains of the west coast of the United States, Baja California and British Columbia. Of the three non-western species, the Sacramento Mountain salamander (\"A. hardii\") is endemic to a mountainous region in New Mexico, while the two currently-described \"Castaneides\" species are endemic to the Appalachian Mountains of eastern United States.\nSpecies.\nTen species in two subgenera are currently assigned to this genus:\n\"Nota bene\": A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than \"Aneides\"."

        "text": "Joshua Morris (born 23 August 1986) is a former Australian professional rugby league footballer who last played as a for the Sydney Roosters in the NRL and Australia at international level.\nHe played for the St. George Illawarra Dragons, Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs and the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in the National Rugby League. Morris played for the Country Origin, Prime Minister's XIII, New South Wales State of Origin and NRL All Stars sides.\nBackground.\nMorris was born in Kiama, New South Wales, Australia.\nHe is the twin brother of Brett Morris, and they played for the Sydney Roosters, St. George Illawarra Dragons and Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs together. They are the sons of former St. George Dragons, New South Wales and Australian rugby league representative Steve Morris.\nSt George Illawarra.\nFollowing his 2007 first grade debut, he played two seasons for the St. George Illawarra Dragons in a variety of backline positions, his preferred position being left centre.\nHe joined the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs for the 2009 NRL season in the hope of securing a permanent starting spot in the centres. Injury permitting, Josh achieved this throughout the season.\nHe made his representative debut for Country in the 2007 City vs Country Origin match. In 2008, he played wing in the Australian Prime Minister's XIII side in its match against Papua New Guinea.\nCanterbury-Bankstown.\nMorris moved to the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs for the 2009 NRL season. In the 2009 State of Origin series Josh was named in the 40-man New South Wales preliminary squad for State of Origin. He was then selected for game 2 and 3, having missed the first game through injury. Morris made his State of Origin debut for NSW 31 years to the day that his dad Steve had made his only test appearance for Australia in 1978.\nMorris finished as Canterbury's top try scorer in 2009 as the club finished the regular season in second place. Morris played in the club's preliminary final defeat against arch rivals Parramatta at ANZ Stadium.\nHe was selected in the 24-man squad for the Gilette Four Nations Tour at the end of the 2009 season and made his international debut for Australia against France at Charlety Stadium in Paris on 7 November, scoring two tries playing inside his brother Brett, who also scored twice.\nIn round 3 of the 2010 NRL season, he scored the first 4-try haul of his first grade career in Canterbury's 60–14 drubbing of the Sydney Roosters.\nMorris was selected to play on the right wing against Wales in the 2011 Rugby League Four Nations.\nAt the 2012 Dally M Awards Morris was named the NRL's centre of the year. Morris played in the 2012 NRL grand final loss to Melbourne at Centre and nearly scored a try which would have brought Canterbury back into the game but the ball was knocked out of his hands by Melbourne fullback Billy Slater.\nMorris played for Canterbury in the 2014 NRL Grand Final loss to Souths at centre. On 10 July 2018, Morris signed a two-year deal to join Cronulla-Sutherland starting in 2019 due to the salary cap crisis at Canterbury where the club needed to offload players. Morris was in talks with the Gold Coast Titans but ultimately decided to join Cronulla as he would have a chance to play under coach Shane Flanagan.\nCronulla-Sutherland.\nMorris made his first appearance for Cronulla in round 1 of the 2019 NRL season against Newcastle which ended in a 14–8 loss. Morris scored his first and second try for the club against North Queensland in round 3 as Cronulla won 42–16.\nMorris was selected to play for New South Wales in the 2019 State of Origin series. Morris played in Game 1 which New South Wales lost 18–14 at Suncorp Stadium. Morris was subsequently dropped from the New South Wales team by coach Brad Fittler for the second game.\nIn round 16 against Brisbane, Morris scored a hat-trick but it was ultimately not enough as Cronulla lost the match 24–22 at Shark Park.\nIn Round 23 against the New Zealand Warriors, Morris scored 2 tries as Cronulla won the match 42–16.\nMorris played 23 games for Cronulla in the 2019 NRL season as the club finished 7th on the table and qualified for the finals. Morris scored a try in the club's elimination final defeat against Manly at Brookvale Oval. Morris finished the year as Cronulla's top try scorer with 15 tries.\nIn February 2020, it was reported by the media that Morris had handed in a transfer request to the Cronulla board citing that he wished to join his brother Brett at the Sydney Roosters. Morris spoke to the media saying “I spoke to the boys at Cronulla and I know the timing isn’t ideal. It’s not because I’m unhappy with any of the boys at the Sharks, But this is a unique opportunity. My brother isn’t just any old mate, this is the bloke who I started this journey with, “Now another opportunity has presented itself and I’d regret it for the rest of my life if I didn’t try and make it happen\". On 11 March, the request was granted. The Cronulla club released a statement saying \"The 33-year-old will be released following the Sharks round two match against the Melbourne Storm. After much internal discussion and following lengthy negotiations with the Sydney Roosters, the release request has been granted ultimately due to circumstances surrounding the Sharks salary cap, a situation which has been impacted by previous infringements.\" A transfer of up to $75,000 was also included by the Roosters to help alleviate the Sharks’ well-publicised salary cap issues.\nSydney Roosters.\nIn round 3 of the 2020 NRL season, Morris made his debut for the Sydney Roosters in their 28-12 win over rivals South Sydney.\nIn round 15, Morris scored two tries for the Sydney Roosters in a 38-16 victory over the Wests Tigers at Leichhardt Oval.\nThe following week, he scored two tries in a 58-12 victory over Brisbane at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\nIn the 2020 qualifying final, Morris scored two tries for the Sydney Roosters in a 29-28 loss against Penrith.\nMorris made 17 appearances for the Sydney Roosters in the 2020 NRL season scoring 11 tries. However, premiership success once again eluded him as the club fell short of winning a third straight premiership losing to Canberra in the second week of the finals.\nIn round 2 of the 2021 NRL season, the Sydney Roosters defeated Wests Tigers 40-6. Following the game, Morris was sent a vile message on Instagram by 21-year old Koen Thwaite which read “F*** you dog c***, you f***ed up my multi, I’m out the front of leumeah stadium waiting for your bus to rock up, Wait till you walk out of the that [sic] back door, you won’t know what hit ya\".\nMorris later shared the message online saying \"This stuff needs to stop\". Australian betting company Sportsbet issued a statement later that day saying Thwaite had been banned for life from betting with their company.\nIn round 8 of the 2021 NRL season, Morris scored a hat-trick in the Sydney Roosters 38-4 victory over Newcastle. On 2 August 2021, it was announced that Morris would miss at least five weeks with a hamstring injured he suffered in the club's 28-0 victory over Parramatta. On 30 August 2021, Morris announced he would retire from rugby league following the conclusion of the 2021 NRL season."

It has three cricket pitches, all on the Moor Park site, and regularly hosts Lancashire second team and other representative matches.\nProminent players.\nJohnny Briggs played cricket for Northern in 1878 and 1879. He debuted for Lancashire in 1879 aged just 16, and went on to become the only player in the county's history to score over 10,000 runs and take over 1,000 wickets (1,696 in all). Johnny played 33 tests matches for England, taking 118 wickets and scoring 815 runs. His test career was ended in 1899 by illness during the Headingley test match against Australia, and he met with a premature and unfortunate death just 3 years later.\nDr John Winter is probably the club's finest amateur player, first playing in the 1937 season. \nIn 1955 he scored 1,423 runs, which remained a record until 2007 for runs in a season by any player in Liverpool Competition cricket, and hit 8 centuries in the process. \nHe scored a total of 30 first team centuries for the club, despite a career interrupted by the war, the first in 1938 and the last in 1962.\nNew Zealander James Marshall played for Northern during the 2004 season, at the end of which he returned to his homeland to break into the Blackcaps' test match team in their series against Australia. James returned to Northern in 2005, to help the club to their ECB Premier League championship success of that year.\nLike Marshall, Stephen Parry played for Northern in 2004 and 2005, being both the Premier League's Player of the Season and Bowler of the Season in the club's championship of 2005, before embarking on a professional career with Lancashire. In February 2014, Parry was named in England's squad for the limited-overs series in West Indies and the World Twenty20 in Bangladesh.\nPhil Jaques played for Northern in 1999, via a cricketing scholarship award from New South Wales, and went on to play test match cricket for Australia from 2005. Phil also enjoyed a successful career in English county cricket with Northamptonshire, Worcestershire and Yorkshire."

The club's ground is located at the Zimbabwe grounds in the Highfield. As of 2007–08, it is one of the strongest cricket clubs in Zimbabwe.\nHistory.\nThe club was created in 1990 when Givemore Makoni and Stephen Mangongo decided they wanted to start a cricket club. The two looked for a place to call home, when after a long search, Churchill High School offered their facilities. Part of the arrangement, was that the club would be called Old Winstonians.\nIn 2001, the name was changed from Old Winstonians to Takashinga. By that point, a home base had been set up in the Highfields. Bill Flower, father of Andy Flower supported the early members of Takashinga. Givemore Makoni told Cricinfo, \"We have changed the name to identify with ourselves and our community. We are a black club, and 'Winstonians' does not identify with us in any way. 'Takashinga' means we are brave and we will fight all the way. This symbolizes the black people of Zimbabwe who are no quitters at anything they set their mind on.\"\nThe cricket club was officially opened in 2003 by West Indian cricketer Brian Lara, whose team was on tour and using Takashinga as a practice venue. A plaque recognizing the moment was hung at the Takashinga's club house.\nInternational Cricket.\nTakashinga Cricket Club was one of the venues for the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. All matches in the tournament had One Day International (ODI) status. Takashinga hosted its first ever ODI on 18 June 2023, when West Indies played USA in the second match of the Qualifier tournament.\nList of One Day International Centuries at Takashinga.\nFive ODI centuries have been scored at Takashinga."

There were 136 participants from 54 nations in the race over 196.80 km, with 27 cyclists who did not finish. The maximum number of cyclists per nation was three, down from four in previous editions of the event. The event was won by Olaf Ludwig of East Germany, the first medal for the nation in the men's individual road race (and first victory for any German cyclist). West Germany also earned its first medals in the event, with Bernd Gröne's silver and Christian Henn's bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 13th appearance of the event, previously held in 1896 and then at every Summer Olympics since 1936. It replaced the individual time trial event that had been held from 1912 to 1932 (and which would be reintroduced alongside the road race in 1996).\nAlgeria, Andorra, the People's Republic of China, Chinese Taipei, the Republic of the Congo, Monaco, Sierra Leone, Suriname, and the United Arab Emirates each made their debut in the men's individual road race. Great Britain made its 13th appearance in the event, the only nation to have competed in each appearance to date.\nCompetition format and course.\nThe mass-start race was on a 196.8 kilometre course over the Tongil-ro Circuit in Paju. The course was \"very flat and easy.\"\nResults.\nThe easy course kept the cyclists together and limited non-finishers; nearly 100 cyclists moved in a large pack through most of the race. Ludwig made two break attempts late, being caught by renowned sprinter Abdoujaparov and aborting the charge the first time. For the second breakaway, he was joined by Gröne; this time, Ludwig continued his attack and outsprinted Gröne at the end to win."

He pitched alongside fellow future Major League Baseball pitcher Dave LaPoint.\nMontreal.\nPalmer was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the 21st round (489th overall) of the 1976 amateur entry draft. He pitched in the Expos organization until 1985. Although he made his major league debut in 1978, he pitched only a handful of minor league games in 1981 due to injuries, and had to fight his way back from Triple-A in 1982, where he made nine minor league starts. Additionally, he did not throw a single pitch in 1983 due to further injuries.\nOn April 21, 1984, Palmer pitched an unusual moment in baseball history when he threw a five-inning perfect game in the second game of a doubleheader at Busch Stadium against the St. Louis Cardinals. Officials called the game on account of rain, and major-league baseball officials later struck the game from baseball's official list of perfect games since it only lasted five innings.\nHe was granted free agency on November 12, 1985.\nAtlanta.\nPalmer was signed by the Atlanta Braves on February 13, 1986, shortly before pitchers and catchers were to report to spring training. Having his best season statistically, Palmer was granted free agency on November 12, 1986. After testing the free agent waters for the second time in his career, Palmer decided to sign back with the Braves on December 19, 1986. However, his second season in Atlanta did not prove to duplicate his first, and he was granted free agency on November 9, 1987.\nPhiladelphia.\nPalmer was signed as a free agent by the Philadelphia Phillies on December 18, 1987. Although Palmer pitched reasonably well for the Phillies, he was released on October 13, 1988. His tenure in Philadelphia was best remembered for a blooper in which he tripped over his foot and the third base bag and landed on his face. \nDetroit and beyond.\nPalmer was signed as a free agent by the Detroit Tigers on February 25, 1989, shortly before the exhibition season began in spring training. Although Palmer broke camp with the Tigers, he pitched poorly and was demoted after making five starts. After making 10 minor league starts, Palmer was released by the Detroit Tigers on July 13, 1989. On July 27, 1989 Palmer signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians. Palmer finished the season in the minor leagues, and never pitched in the major leagues with the Indians. He was released on October 26, 1989.\nPersonal life.\nPalmer lives in the Atlanta area and was the pitching coach for Parkview High School, Gwinnett County, Georgia for a number of years. \nPalmer has a son, John Brandon \"Chili\" Palmer and two daughters, Liza Michelle Palmer and Leah Victoria Palmer. His son-in-law is David Allen."

He played college football at Arizona State.\nEarly life and education.\nNoble attended Anaheim High School where he played football and baseball, and football at Fullerton College before attending Arizona State University. At Fullerton College he played football for head coach Hal Sherbeck, who he credits for setting him straight, and helping him to understand what it would take to be successful in football and life.\nProfessional career.\nFor the 1985 NFL Draft, Noble was selected in the fifth round (125th overall) by the Green Bay Packers. By Week 2, he was starting at right inside linebacker and had an outstanding first season, recording 104 tackles with three sacks. For that, he was named to the Pro Football Writers Association’s NFL All-Rookie Team.\nNoble shifted to right outside linebacker in 1986, but the following year he returned to the interior at left inside linebacker and had a career-high five fumble recoveries in the strike-shortened 1987. For the remainder of his career, Noble was settled in at inside linebacker and led the Packers in tackles in three out of four seasons (1986, 1987, and 1989). The only reason he missed out on the team tackles lead in 1988 was because he sat out the season’s first four games due to a contract dispute, and his holdout lasted 67 days but by his third week back, he had reclaimed his starting position. The following season, in a Week 9 game at Tampa Bay, Noble recovered a fumble from Buccaneers quarterback Chris Chandler and took it into the end zone for the only touchdown of his NFL career in a 27-0 Packers victory.\nNoble had missed only four games due to injury leading up to the second week of the 1993 season when he tore ligaments in his right knee in a loss to Philadelphia. Diagnosed with a torn ACL, Noble was placed on injured reserve for the rest of the season and thus was denied the opportunity to play in his first playoff game as the Packers with Brett Favre and Reggie White began their rise to becoming an NFL powerhouse under head coach Mike Holmgren. In 117 career games, Noble was credited with 543 unassisted tackles.\nPost-football career.\nAfter retiring from the National Football League, Noble was hired by WBAY-TV in Green Bay on to produce his own outdoor television program called \"Hitting the Outdoors\" which aired throughout the Midwest, while also becoming a member of the station's telecast team during Packers preseason games. Noble also owned and operated a sports memorabilia and apparel business called “The Pro Image”, which was located in Kronenwetter, Wisconsin. He later owned the Green Bay Blizzard until October 2009, which played in the AF2. He and his wife Cindy are the co-founders of a 501(c)(3) corporation \"A Noble Cause\" for kids with cancer which raises money for children and their families dealing with cancer by selling multi-colored cancer awareness bracelets. Noble and his wife have four daughters, and as of June 11, 2008, the entire family lives in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he later became an assistant football coach at Coronado High School."

        "text": "Stephen Hough Wright (born April 8, 1959) is a former American football offensive tackle in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys, Indianapolis Colts and Los Angeles Raiders. He was also a member of the Oakland Invaders of the United States Football League. He played college football at Northern Iowa and then played eleven professional seasons with four teams from 1981–1992. He also appeared on \"\" where he placed tenth and became the third jury member.\nEarly years.\nWright attended Wayzata High School, where he played football, basketball, track, and hockey. He was an All-American in the shot put and discus throw.\nHe accepted a football scholarship from the University of Northern Iowa. He played offensive tackle during his first three years. As a senior he was switched to tight end, registering 8 receptions for 73 yards and one touchdown.\nIn 1997, he was inducted into the Northern Iowa Athletics Hall of Fame.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nWright was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys after the 1981 NFL Draft. He appeared in 16 games, playing mainly on special teams and as a backup offensive tackle.\nIn 1982, he was moved to the backup guard position. Because of an injury to Kurt Petersen, he was the right guard in the offensive line that blocked on Tony Dorsett's record 99-yard touchdown run against the Minnesota Vikings. Also while with the Cowboys, Wright additionally blocked for another future \"Survivor\" contestant, Gary Hogeboom (\"\"), who was the team's backup quarterback.\nBaltimore/Indianapolis Colts (first stint).\nOn August 26, 1983, he was traded to the Baltimore Colts in exchange for a sixth round draft choice (#144-Kurt Ploeger). In his first year with the Baltimore Colts he started ten games at right guard. He missed 3 games with an ankle injury. In 1984, when the team moved to Indianapolis, he replaced an injured Chris Hinton at left tackle and started nine games.\nOakland Invaders (USFL).\nIn December 1984, he signed with the Michigan Panthers of the United States Football League. Before the start of the next season, the Panthers merged with the Oakland Invaders. The team would reach the USFL Championship Game, losing to the Baltimore Stars. Wright, who wore #70 with the Invaders, scored a touchdown in a May game against the Denver Gold when Invaders quarterback Bobby Hebert completed a two-yard pass to Wright, who was tackle eligible on the play.\nLos Angeles Raiders.\nIn 1987, he signed with the Los Angeles Raiders. After the players went on a strike on the third week of the season, those games were canceled (reducing the 16 game season to 15) and the NFL decided that the games would be played with replacement players. Wright was part of the Raiders replacement team, that was given the mock name \"Masqueraiders\" by the media. He ended up playing well in those games as the starter at right tackle and was kept for the rest of the season playing mainly as a backup.\nIn 1990, he became a full-time starter at right tackle after replacing an injured Bruce Wilkerson and keeping his job after Wilkerson returned and was moved to left tackle. \nIn 1991 was awarded the Ed Block Courage Award. 1992, he missed nine games with a right shoulder injury. On August, 23, 1993, he was placed on the injured reserve list. He retired from professional football in June 1994 at the age of 35.\nPersonal life.\nWright founded Cloudburst, a company that was the first to provide NFL sideline mist cooling. Cloudburst was contracted to cool the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics. Steve's other mist cooling company Mist &amp; Cool, was in over 1,500 Home Depots, Lowes, Costco and Targets. He sold the business in 2000. Today, Wright is married and lives in Malibu, California.\nIn August, 2010, Wright appeared as a contestant on of the American competitive reality television series \"Survivor\".

        "title": "Bob Mann (American football)",
        "text": "Robert Mann (April 8, 1924 – October 21, 2006) was an American professional football player in the National Football League (NFL). A native of New Bern, North Carolina, Mann played college football for the Hampton Pirates in 1942 and 1943 and the Michigan Wolverines in 1944, 1946 and 1947. Playing the end position, he broke the Big Ten Conference record for receiving yards in 1946 and 1947. After not being selected in the 1948 NFL Draft, Mann signed his first professional football contract with the Detroit Lions, where he stayed for two seasons. He later played for the Green Bay Packers for parts of five seasons until 1954. Mann broke the color barrier for both teams.\nMann led the NFL in receiving yards (1,014) in 1949. He was asked to take a pay cut after the 1949 season and became a holdout when the Lions opened practice in July 1950. He was traded to the New York Yanks in August 1950 and released three weeks later. Mann charged that he had been forced out of professional football for refusing to take a pay cut. He signed with the Green Bay Packers near the end of the 1950 NFL season and was the team's leading receiver in 1951. He remained with the Packers through part of the 1954 season. After his football career, Mann became a lawyer and practiced in Detroit. He was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1988 and died on October 21, 2006, at the age of 82. He was posthumously inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 2016.\nEarly years.\nBob Mann was born in New Bern, the county seat of Craven County, North Carolina, in 1924. At the time of his childhood, New Bern was a small town of about 10,000 and was still segregated. His father, William Mann, was a physician, and his mother, Clara Mann, was a supervisor of Craven County elementary schools. Mann began his football career at West Street High School in New Bern.\nCollege football.\nHampton Institute.\nIn 1941, Mann enrolled at Hampton Institute (now known as Hampton University), a historically black university located in Hampton, Virginia. He joined their Pirates football team, and as a sophomore, he scored 45 of Hampton's 99 points while playing at the left end position. He scored three touchdowns in Hampton's final game of the season against Virginia Union.\nUniversity of Michigan.\nMann transferred to the University of Michigan in 1944, where his father hoped that he would attend the university's medical program. He joined the football team as a walk-on and was one of only two African American players (Gene Derricotte was the other) on the 1944 Michigan Wolverines football team. Mann served in the Navy from 1944 until the end of World War II, although he was stationed in Staten Island and was not deployed overseas. After his service, he returned to Michigan in 1946. \nMann started two games at the left end for Fritz Crisler's 1946 Michigan football team. On November 16 against Wisconsin, he caught three passes for 74 yards and two touchdowns, while also gaining 26 yards on two end-around runs. Against Ohio State the following week, he had 101 yards receiving on 5 catches, 2 of which went for touchdowns. He added another 33 yards on two end-around runs. Despite seeing only limited action, his 1946 total of 13 receptions for 284 receiving yards set a new Big Ten Conference record. With 30 points on five touchdowns, Mann was also the second-leading scorer on the 1946 Michigan team, trailing only placekicker Jim Brieske. He also gained 114 yards on nine end-around runs in 1946, earning him a nickname as the \"fifth man\" in behind Michigan's four primary ball-carriers.\nAs a senior, Mann started seven games at left end on Crisler's undefeated 1947 Michigan team. He caught 12 passes for 302 yards and three touchdowns and ran for 129 yards on 15 end-around plays. On October 4, against Stanford, Mann caught a 61-yard touchdown pass from Bob Chappuis on Michigan's second play of the game. Against Pitt the following week, he caught three passes for 105 yards and two touchdowns, including a 70-yard scoring play on a pass from Chappuis.\nAfter the 1947 season, Mann and fellow Michigan end, Len Ford, played in the East–West college all-star game at Gilmore Stadium in Los Angeles; both caught touchdown passes in the game. Mann was also selected by the Associated Press as a first-team end for its All-Big Nine team. He was also selected as a second-team All-American by the Associated Press and the Football Writers Association of America. Michigan coach Crisler called him \"the greatest pass receiver he has ever coached\". In 2016, Mann was posthumously inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame.\nProfessional football.\nDetroit Lions.\nIn February 1948, Mann traveled to New York and met with New York Yankees coach Ray Flaherty. Mann said at the time that he would like to play for the Yankees, but was reluctant to agree to any terms as he was expecting to receive interest from several other teams in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and National Football League (NFL). In April 1948, Mann signed with the Detroit Lions of the NFL; his first contract was for $7,500. He was also hired to a sales position at the Goebel Brewing Company, which was owned by Lions' president Edwin J. Anderson. At the time, Detroit's new head coach Bo McMillin said, \"We're tickled to get Mann. We've been after his name on a Detroit contract ever since I came here as a coach. We know he will be a valuable professional performer\".\n1948 season.\nAs a rookie in 1948, Mann and halfback Mel Groomes became the first African Americans to play for the Lions. Even though team owners claimed that a ban on African American players did not exist, between 1933 and 1945 no African American played in the NFL. Teams in the rival AAFC were much more willing to sign African American players. Even after the NFL began signing African American players to their rosters, it took many years for them to be given the same opportunities as white players.\nMann appeared in all 12 games for the Lions in the 1948 season, though none as a starter. Despite his role as a backup, Mann finished the season with 33 catches for 560 yards, ranking him seventh in the NFL in receiving yards and fourth in yards per reception. The Lions would finish the year with a record of , putting them in last place in the Western Division. In December 1948, Mann joined Jesse Owens' Olympians professional basketball team in Cleveland. Mann had played two years of college basketball at Hampton Institute.\n1949 season.\nIn the preseason before the 1949 season, the Lions played an exhibition game against the Philadelphia Eagles in New Orleans. Coach McMillin met with the Lions' African American players, including Mann, and explained that due to racial issues, they would not be able to play in the game.\nOn December 11, 1949, Mann was credited with eight catches for 182 yards and two touchdowns (including a 64-yard touchdown pass from Frank Tripucka in the first quarter and a 41-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter) against the Green Bay Packers. After the game, Mann's wife, described as \"an ardent football fan\", told statistician Nick Kerbawy that her tally sheet showed that her husband caught nine passes. Kerbawy reexamined the play-by-play account and discovered she was right. The new total of nine receptions set a new Lions' record for a single game.\nDuring the 1949 season, Mann led the NFL with 1,014 receiving yards. He also finished second in receptions with 66 (Tom Fears set an NFL record in 1949 with 77 receptions). At the time, Mann's season totals in receiving yards and receptions both ranked in the top five all-time. He also became the first Lions' player to eclipse 1,000 receiving yards in a season. Despite leading the NFL in receiving yards, Mann was not selected by the United Press (UP) for either its first- or second-team All-NFL team. Instead, he was named in its \"Honorable Mention\" team.\nDuring the off-season in 1950, the Lions asked Mann to take a $1,500 pay cut from $7,500 to $6,000. According to the Lions, the pay cut request was based on the larger pool of available players and the merger of the AAFC and NFL before the start of the season. Mann objected and refused to sign a 1950 contract. Further complicating the negotiations, the African American community in Detroit had called for a boycott of Goebel beer, after a bid by an African American group for a distributorship in Detroit's black community had been rejected. Mann recalled that Goebels/Lions president Anderson was under the mistaken impression that Mann had met with representatives of the boycott.\nNew York Yanks.\nOn July 31, 1950, Mann became a holdout when he failed to show up on the first day of practice for the Lions. That same day, his position for Goebel was terminated. Four days later, he was sent to the New York Yanks in payment for quarterback Bobby Layne. The Lions had previously traded fullback Camp Wilson for Layne, but Wilson refused to report to the Yanks. Mann later recalled that Yanks' coach Red Strader was upset about the trade. Despite performing well during the team's training camp, Mann received little playing time in exhibition games. John Rauch, a rookie quarterback, told Mann that he had been ordered by coach Strader not to throw to him. Although it was unclear why he was not being thrown to, Mann understood the reason to be racially motivated. The day after Rauch threw a 50-yard touchdown pass to Mann in a pre-season game against the Washington Redskins, Mann was released by the Yanks. He was not picked up by any other team and officially became a free agent.\nThrough October 1950, Mann was jobless. At the end of the month, Mann publicly charged that he had been \"railroaded\" out of professional football. After he objected to the Lions' proposed pay cut, he asserted that the NFL had taken a \"hands off\" policy toward him. Mann publicly stated, \"I must have been blackballed – it just doesn't make sense that I'm suddenly not good enough to make a single team in the league\". The Lions' response to Mann's charge was a statement that they felt he was too small in stature to be an effective blocker. Mann filed a lawsuit against the NFL based on his belief that NFL owners colluded to avoid signing him. Commissioner Bert Bell disagreed, even though he was familiar with the way that team owners had worked together to not sign black players over the previous decade.\nGreen Bay Packers.\n1950–1951.\nMann was signed by the Green Bay Packers on November 25, 1950, ending his suit against the NFL. On November 26, 1950, he appeared in the Packers' final home game against the San Francisco 49ers and became—at the time—the first known African American to play for the team. It was later determined that Walt Jean, an offensive lineman for the Packers in the 1920s, was African American through his father's side of the family; this was not known by Jean's teammates at the time, thus the color barrier was officially broken for the Packers when Mann played his first game with the team. Mann ended up playing in three games for the Packers in the 1950 season, catching six passes for 89 yards and one touchdown.\nIn the 1951 season, Mann led the Packers with 50 catches, 696 receiving yards, and eight touchdowns; he also ranked fourth in the NFL in both receptions and receiving yards that year. Mann's best performance in 1951 came in an October game against the Philadelphia Eagles; he caught three touchdown passes while the Packers upset the favored Eagles. The Packers ended the season with a record of , the fourth straight season they won three or fewer games.\n1952–1955.\nIn the 1952 NFL draft, the Packers selected Rice University end Billy Howton with their second round pick. Howton, who elicited comparisons to Hall of Famer Don Hutson, made an immediate impact on the Packers, leading the league in the 1952 season with 1,231 receiving yards. Even with Howton in the lineup, Mann had a productive year, recording 30 receptions for 517 yards and six touchdowns. The Packers improved their record to , finishing fourth in their conference.\nBy the 1953 season, Mann and Howton were considered one of the best receiving duos in the league, though both players missed several games due to injury throughout the season. In ten games, Mann finished the year with 23 receptions for 327 yards and two touchdowns, all of which were second to Howton's totals for the season. Mann's best game in 1953 came in a 21–21 tie against the Chicago Bears; according to the \"Green Bay Press-Gazette\", Mann \"was open all afternoon as the Bears chased Howton\" while catching six passes for 101 yards, including a 45-yard catch. The Packers ended the year in last place in their conference with a record of .\nIn the 1954 season, Mann played in only two of the Packers' first four games. In those two games, he did not record a catch. He had sustained a knee injury during a preseason game against the Philadelphia Eagles and was subsequently released by the team six weeks later in October. In November 1955, Mann filed a $25,000 breach of contract suit against the Packers. Mann claimed his release was illegal because he was not given written notice by the team. Mann and the Packers ultimately settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount in 1957. Mann's knee injury forced him to retire from professional football.\nRace.\nWhen Mann joined the Packers, the city of Green Bay, Wisconsin, had fewer than 20 African American residents. Despite this lack of diversity, Mann's time with the Packers was largely free of overt racial incidents. Racial issues did arise when Mann traveled to other cities with the team. \"Green Bay Press-Gazette\" sports writer Art Daley recalled a story involving Mann and teammate Dick Afflis, who later became known in professional wrestling as \"Dick the Bruiser\". The Packers stayed at a Baltimore hotel that would not allow Mann to stay with the team on account of its policy prohibiting African-American guests. When Mann left to go to another hotel, the Afflis left with him. When a cab driver told Afflis that he would not drive Mann because of his race, Afflis grabbed the driver by the shirt and said, \"You will take him wherever he wants to go\". Several white teammates reached out to Mann to welcome him after he signed with the Packers and coach Gene Ronzani gave him additional travel privileges to Milwaukee and Chicago. Overall, Mann enjoyed his time in Green Bay, saying \"I never had any problems. Everyone treated me well\".\nLegacy.\nMann compiled 109 catches for 1,629 yards and 17 touchdowns over his five seasons with the Packers. He was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1988 in recognition of his contributions to the team. His impact was largely felt off the field though, the \"Detroit Free Press\" writing that Mann was a \"pioneer\" wherever he played football, breaking multiple color barriers and doing so in a \"dignified and friendly manner\" that showed his \"strength and determination\". Packers' team historian Cliff Christl noted that \"Mann endured unimaginable obstacles just to gain [the] opportunity\" to play professional football.\nLegal career and personal life.\nAfter retiring from football, Mann returned to Detroit where he worked in real estate sales for the next decade. Mann was married twice, his first marriage ending in divorce. He remarried in 1956, and with his wife, Vera, had two daughters, Marjorie and Marilyn. In 1966, at age 43, Mann enrolled in night school at Detroit College of Law. He graduated from law school in 1970 and worked as a criminal defense lawyer for over 30 years in Detroit, heading the firm of Robert Mann &amp; Associates. Mann's law office was located a few blocks from the Detroit Lions' Ford Field. At the Lions' first regular season game at Ford Field on September 22, 2002, Mann was the Lions' honorary captain. He died on October 21, 2006, aged 82."

        "text": "Fred Cone (June 21, 1926 – December 31, 2021) was an American professional football player who was a fullback and placekicker in the National Football League (NFL) for the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys. He played college football for the Clemson Tigers. He was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.\nEarly life.\nCone grew up in Pine Apple, Alabama, with a population around 100. He attended Moore Academy, a rural school from primary school through high school. He did not play football because there were not enough people to field a team.\nBefore going to college, he enlisted in the U.S. Army to take part of World War II, where he served in the Pacific as part of the 11th Airborne Division.\nCollege career.\nWhen he returned to the United States] in the summer of 1946, he read a newspaper advertisement about tryouts at Auburn University and decided to attend. His participation was cut short with an ankle injury that forced him to return home.\nDuring his recovery, a family friend turned out to be the sister of Frank Howard, the head coach at Clemson College. She helped Cone get a tryout and eventually he was able to make the team and receive a scholarship.\nAs a sophomore with the Tigers, Cone was the starting fullback in a backfield that included Ray Mathews. The 1948 team accomplished a 10–0 undefeated season and beat the University of Missouri, 24–23, in the 1949 Gator Bowl. He scored two first-quarter touchdowns and had a critical fourth down conversion late in the game. He finished as the team's leading rusher with 635 yards and 7 touchdowns. Cone was mentioned in the Jerry Clower 1974 album \"Country Ham\" which mentioned Clower's 1948 Mississippi State Bulldogs football team (then Maroons) playing Clemson in which Clower was assigned to tackle Cone and missed.\nAs a junior, he registered 703 rushing yards and 9 touchdowns.\nAs a senior, his 184 carries for 845 rushing yards, 15 touchdowns and 92 points at the time were all school season records. He also was a part of another undefeated season and against Auburn University, he rushed for 163 yards and scored 4 touchdowns. He played in the 1951 Orange Bowl, beating the University of Miami 15–14. He gained 81 rushing yards, scored one of the touchdowns, returned one kickoff and had 4 punts.\nCone finished his college career with eight 100-yard career rushing games, 31 touchdowns and 189 points. He also was a kickoff specialist.\nIn 1973, he was inducted into the State of South Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame and the Clemson Athletic Hall of Fame. He is a member of Clemson's Ring of Honor.\nProfessional career.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nCone was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the third round (27th overall) of the 1951 NFL draft. He was used as a fullback and placekicker.\nAs a rookie, he led the team with 50 points, and was the second-leading rusher with 56 carries for 190 yards (3.4-yard average). He also made 5 of 7 field goal attempts and 29 of 35 extra points.\nCone led the Packers in scoring in five of the next six seasons, including leading the league with 16 field goals made in 1955. In 1956, he announced his retirement, but was convinced by the team to return to play.\nIn 1957, he was a part of the inaugural game at Lambeau Field, then known as City Stadium, contributing to an upset of the Chicago Bears 21–17, before a crowd of 32,132 people. He finished the season by leading his team in scoring with 74 points.\nCone played for the Packers during a low point in the franchise history, never experiencing a winning season, which cost him the opportunity to earn more accolades for his play.\nIn 1974, he was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.\nDallas Cowboys.\nOn May 12, 1960, he was signed as a free agent by the Dallas Cowboys after being out of football for two years, while coaching at University Military School in Mobile, Alabama. He became the first starter at placekicker in franchise history. He also was a backup fullback and reunited with former college teammate Ray Mathews. He retired after the season.\nPersonal life and Death.\nIn his first two years in the NFL, he worked for the Packers during the offseason promoting season-ticket sales. He later accepted a job promoting beer with the Miller Brewing Company. He was an assistant football coach at the University Military School in Mobile, Alabama.\nIn 1961, he joined the Clemson football coaching staff. He also worked for the Clemson athletic department as their chief football recruiter in the 1960s.\nCountry comedian Jerry Clower, who played football at Mississippi State University, recounted his experience facing Cone on the field in his story \"The Time We Played Clemson\".\nCone died of complications from a broken hip in Seneca, South Carolina, on December 31, 2021, at the age of 95."

        "text": "John Cohen (born September 21, 1966) is the 16th athletic director for the Auburn University Tigers. He is former head baseball coach of Mississippi State University, where he also served as the athletic director from 2016 to 2022.\nPlaying career.\nCohen played college baseball at Mississippi State (1988–1990) after spending a single season at Birmingham-Southern College in Alabama (1986). In 1989, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Hyannis Mets of the Cape Cod Baseball League and was named a league all-star. He also played on the 1990 College World Series team his senior year at Mississippi State. He then spent two years in the Minnesota Twins farm system (1990–1991).\nCoaching career.\nCohen served as an assistant coach at the University of Missouri from 1992 to 1997 before becoming head coach at Northwestern State University from 1998 to 2001, where he won two conference championships. He moved on to the University of Florida for two seasons (2002–2003) as an assistant before accepting the head coaching job at the University of Kentucky. On June 6, 2008, Cohen was announced as the head coach of his alma mater, Mississippi State.\nTenure as athletic director.\nJohn Cohen became the new Auburn Athletic Director in November 2022, replacing Allen Greene. In Cohen's previous stop, he was AD at his alma mater, Mississippi State University. John Cohen guided the Bulldog program to record-breaking success since being announced as the school's 17th director of athletics on November 4, 2016. Cohen leads a department that encompasses 16 sports and more than 350 student-athletes.\nThe former MSU head baseball coach and two-time Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year has overseen arguably the greatest era in Bulldog athletics history, highlighted by a 2021 College World Series Championship for the school's first team national title in any sport.\nUnder Cohen's watch, 44 teams have advanced to NCAA postseason play, including a school-record 13 during the 2018-19 athletic year. That occurred just a year after the Bulldogs produced a then-school-record 12 postseason squads during the 2017-18 athletic campaign.\nIn the classroom, MSU student-athletes continue to set new standards achieving a department GPA of 3.0 or higher for nine consecutive semesters while continuing to exceed the national APR multiyear rate in all sports. Most recently, Bulldog student-athletes turned in a 3.1 GPA in the fall of 2021 with 11 sports recording at least a 3.0 GPA.\nA nationally respected leader within intercollegiate athletics, Cohen serves on the prestigious 10-member NCAA Division I Baseball Committee as part of a four-year term that began on September 1, 2019. Sixteen individuals have played and coached in the College World Series. Cohen is one of two among that elite group, who have played, coached and later served as director of athletics for a participating school. He is one of three active SEC athletics director to hire an eventual national championship winning head coach in any sport.\nSo far during the 2021-22 athletic year, football became one of eight programs nationally and four in the SEC to make a bowl game in each of the last dozen years, joining Alabama, Georgia and Texas A&amp;M as the only conference teams to do so. The Bulldogs were one of four teams in the nation with three wins against opponents ranked in the final College Football Playoff Top 25 and the only team in the nation that faced six teams in the final rankings during the season. In the classroom, head coach Mike Leach's squad turned in a record GPA for the second straight semester.\nVolleyball made the program's first NCAA tournament appearance after earning an at-large bid. The Bulldogs rewrote the record books, posting a 25–6 overall record and 16–2 mark in SEC play to finish second overall in the conference. Head coach Julie Darty Dennis was named the 2021 SEC Coach of the Year and the 2021 AVCA South Region Coach of the Year after leading the Bulldogs to the most successful season in program history. Dennis became the first coach in MSU volleyball history to take home Coach of the Year honors.\nState's 2020-21 athletic year featured unprecedented success in the sport of baseball. Tanner Allen earned the SEC's Player of the Year award, head coach Chris Lemonis garnered National Coach of the Year accolades, and most notably, the Bulldogs won the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska, among 25,000-plus members of the Bulldog family.\nFootball claimed its first win over a ranked opponent in a bowl game since 1940. Men's basketball turned in a runner-up finish at the 2021 NIT, earning a bid in postseason play for the third straight year. Softball finished the regular season winning seven straight SEC games and reached the NCAA tournament for the 16th time. Track and field was well-represented in Tokyo, Japan, at the Olympic Games with six Bulldogs competing for their respective countries. Eight members of the track and field earned All-America honors at either the indoor or outdoor NCAA Track and Field Championships, and the men's team finished ranked inside the top 15 nationally.\nMeanwhile, Bulldog student-athletes enjoyed success in the classroom again during the spring of 2021, posting the highest department GPA for a semester ever at 3.2. Four programs (baseball, men's basketball, football and women's golf) recorded their highest-ever spring GPA, while football's GPA marked its highest ever at the time.\nMSU student-athletes continue to earn opportunities to compete at the next level. In 2020, MSU was the only school in the country with multiple players selected in each of the NFL, MLB and NBA drafts.\nThough several sport seasons were cut short in 2019-20 due to COVID-19, Bulldog student-athletes posted many outstanding achievements. Football reached a bowl game to conclude the decade as one of only five SEC programs to go to a bowl every season from 2010 to 2019. A few months later, MSU made history when it became the first school to sweep all four Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame and Museum awards in the same athletic year for the best player in the state of Mississippi and was on its way to accomplishing the feat again prior to the cancellation of spring sports. Baseball finished ranked among the top 10 and saw a program-record three student-athletes picked in the first two rounds of the 2020 MLB First Year Player Draft. Women's basketball competed in its fifth-consecutive SEC Tournament title game. Only Tennessee (1988–92) matches that mark for most consecutive championship game appearances in SEC Tournament history. Women's basketball ended the year ranked inside the top 10 of the AP Poll for the fourth year in a row, finishing the season ranked ninth. Softball turned in 25 wins which tied for the most in the country and earned its highest final ranking in program history at No. 20.\nCohen has hired 12 head coaches during his tenure, including Mike Leach who is a two-time national coach of the year, three-time conference coach of the year and the mastermind behind the NCAA record-setting “Air Raid” offense. The accomplishments for Leach in his 20 years as a head coach are long and distinguished. Leach, a proven winner, has earned 150 career victories, which is tied for the fourth most as an FBS head coach among active coaches. He has guided his squads to 18 bowl games, produced seven seasons of at least nine victories and captured two conference division titles. Leach is the winningest coach in Texas Tech history and owns school records for bowl appearances at both Texas Tech (10) and Washington State (6).\nCohen's third athletic year in charge was a historic one. MSU captured three SEC team championships during 2018–19 as women's basketball and men's tennis defended their respective crowns. Women's basketball also secured its first-ever SEC Tournament championship before going onto an Elite Eight appearance and finishing as high as No. 4 in the national polls.\nThe Bulldogs combined for 151 victories in the sports of football, men's and women's basketball, softball and baseball in 2018–19, representing the highest total in the SEC. MSU tied for the national lead with the most first-round selections in the NFL, NBA, WNBA and MLB Drafts with five. The five first-round picks are the most by MSU in a calendar year in its history.\nIn the summer of 2018, Cohen identified one of top recruiters and player development coaches in the country to serve as the Diamond Dawgs’ 18th head baseball skipper. Chris Lemonis became the winningest first-year head coach in SEC history as MSU won 52 games en route to its second consecutive College World Series appearance in Omaha, Nebraska. The Diamond Dawgs earned a national seed (No. 6), hosted regional and super regionals at the new Dudy Noble Field, clinched a share of the SEC Western Division title and finished as high as No. 3 in the final polls.\nIn addition, the Bulldog men's and women's basketball programs both appeared in the NCAA tournament during the same season for the first time since 2008–09.\nThe 2017-18 athletic year saw State become the only school in the nation to win a bowl game, reach an NCAA Final Four – men's or women's – and the College World Series. During that same campaign, MSU claimed multiple SEC championships in a single athletic year for the first time since 1996. Women's basketball earned its first SEC regular season title with a perfect 30–0 regular season and a second-straight NCAA national championship game appearance.\nMatt Roberts, the SEC Coach of the Year, guided the men's tennis team to its first SEC Tournament championship since 1996.\nAs a result of the Bulldogs’ unprecedented athletic success, CBS Sports named MSU the 14th-best athletics program in the country and fourth overall in the SEC for 2017–18. The top four Director's Cup finishes in school history have occurred in the last four years with three under Cohen's watch.\nSince becoming athletic director, Cohen has been the driving force for numerous state-of-the-art facility projects on campus, including the new $68 million Dudy Noble Field, which opened in full capacity in the spring of 2019. The ballpark has drawn rave reviews as the best in all of college baseball and features the Left Field Lofts, a revolutionary experience with luxury two-bedroom suites offering exquisite views of the new Dudy Noble Field.  \nCohen approved construction of a new $3.6 million football game-day home locker room and recruiting center inside the north end of Davis Wade Stadium. The 11,100 square-foot locker room, which opened in September 2018, includes custom-built player lockers, separate coaches and staff locker rooms, an expansive athletic training room as well as an equipment room. In July 2019, state-of-the-art updates were completed in the Leo Seal Jr. Football Complex locker room, which serves as the daily headquarters for MSU football.\nThe Templeton Athletic Academic Center underwent a major renovation in the summer of 2018 with modern wall graphics and displays. In addition, ground was broken in the summer of 2019 on the $8 million-dollar MSU Tennis Pavilion which was completed in the fall of 2020. The 48,815-square-foot facility features six indoor courts, elevated spectator seating, LED lighting and more.\nPlanning is already underway for a major renovation and modernization of Humphrey Coliseum, which will make the historic venue one of the elites in all of college basketball. Expanded concourses, enhanced sightlines, new dining options and a luxurious club level are some of the many features that will be coming to the new-look “Hump.”\nCohen has been instrumental in providing a “championship-level fan experience” at all of MSU's athletic venues. For the first time in school history, State drew over 1 million combined fans in the ticketed sports of football, men's and women's basketball and baseball during the 2018-19 athletic year. In the summer of 2018, MSU announced significant price decreases on all food and beverage at concessions for all home venues that continues today. State also unveiled a football season ticket price reduction in several sections of Davis Wade Stadium.\nCohen's vision launched the Hail State Family Fan Experience survey, an initiative to best serve Bulldog fans based on their feedback. The plan has been responsible for numerous enhancements at venues, including improved sound at Davis Wade Stadium and boosted cell service for major carriers.\nCohen is the only coach in SEC history to win an SEC championship, SEC tournament championship, and advance to the College World Series both as a player and head coach. He and Ron Polk are the only two baseball coaches in SEC history to lead multiple schools to SEC titles. His 2013 Bulldog club advanced to the CWS championship series for the first time in MSU history. Cohen also had the privilege of being a part of a College World Series as a player, head coach and now three times as an athletic director when the Diamond Dawgs reached Omaha in June 2018, 2019 and 2021. His 2012 club produced an SEC record-tying eight Major Leaguers.\nCoaching tree.\nAssistant coaches under John Cohen who are, or have been, head coaches include Gary Henderson, Nick Mingione, and Butch Thompson.\nPersonal life.\nJohn Cohen is originally from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, as is his wife, Nelle Bashinsky Cohen. They have a son and a daughter. Cohen is Jewish."

        "title": "Pairs in Test and first-class cricket",
        "text": "A \"pair\" in cricket refers to when a batsman is dismissed for a duck (without scoring) in both innings. It is called a 'king pair' if the batsman gets out for a golden duck (getting out on the first ball he faced) in both innings.\nThe name originates from the two noughts together being thought to resemble a pair of spectacles; the longer form is occasionally used.\nMost pairs in a Test career.\nNew Zealand fast bowler Chris Martin has been dismissed without scoring in both innings during seven Test matches, three more than any other player. Five players have been dismissed for four pairs of ducks in Tests. Four are bowlers with no great pretensions towards batsmanship – Bhagwat Chandrasekhar of India, Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka and West Indians Mervyn Dillon and Courtney Walsh – but the fifth is top order batsman Marvan Atapattu of Sri Lanka. He started his Test career with just one run in six innings – including two pairs – and has bagged two more since.\nPairs on Test debut.\n45 batsmen have been dismissed for a pair on their debut in Test cricket:\nConsecutive pairs.\nThese batsmen all bagged pairs in two Tests in a row.\nIn recognition of his consecutive Test pairs, Mark Waugh, who had scored a century on his Test debut, was temporarily nicknamed \"Audi\", after the car-maker with the four-circle logo. His teammates pointed out that if he had scored five Test ducks in a row, he could have been nicknamed \"Olympic\". Both expressions have since become part of the terminology of the game, and in Test cricket, three players have actually completed an Olympic: Bob Holland (Australia, 1985), Ajit Agarkar (India, 1999–2000) and Mohammad Asif (Pakistan, 2006).\nPairs by Test captains.\n25 captains have been dismissed for a pair.\nSarfaraz Ahmed and Faf du Plessis made pairs in the same match, the first time this had happened in the same Test.\nPairs by designated Wicket-keepers in Tests.\n52 wicket-keepers have been dismissed for a pair.\nIn July 2019, Jonny Bairstow and Gary Wilson were dismissed without scoring in both innings of the same Test match. It was the first instance of both designated wicket-keepers being dismissed for a pair in a completed Test.\nKing pairs in Test cricket.\nIf a batsman is out first ball he has made a golden duck and if a batsman is dismissed first ball in both innings he has achieved a king pair. This worst of all batting fates has befallen 23 players in the history of Test cricket so far.\nNotable pairs in first-class cricket.\nKing Pairs have been 'bagged' by many players in first-class cricket. Mick Norman of Northamptonshire bagged a king pair in a single day against Glamorgan at St. Helen's in Swansea in June 1964.\nWhen Glamorgan followed on against the Indians at Cardiff Arms Park in June 1946, last man Peter Judge was bowled for a duck by Chandra Sarwate to end the county's first innings. Invited to follow-on, Glamorgan's captain Johnny Clay, who was the non-striker, decided to waive the 10-minute interval between innings, remained in the middle with Judge, and reversed the entire batting order. Sarwate then bowled Judge again, second ball, incidentally with the same ball, and Judge thus achieved the fastest pair in the history of first-class cricket.\nZimbabwe opening bat Hamilton Masakadza completed an unusual pair when he was dismissed for a Test duck twice on the same day, 28 January 2012, when his team's two innings were completed within a day. Another notable pair was made by Neil Harvey on 27 July 1956. Playing in the test where Jim Laker took 19 for 90, Harvey completed a pair within about 2 hours on the second day.\nUnofficial pairs in Twenty20 cricket.\nIn limited overs games decided by a Super Over, it is possible for a batsman to be dismissed for a duck in both the regular innings and the super over. Since runs made in super overs are not counted towards a player's statistical record, this is sometimes referred to an \"unofficial pair\". On 25 July 2013, Shoaib Malik scored an unofficial golden pair for Pakistan International Airlines against Habib Bank Limited, while on 10 January 2014, Moisés Henriques scored an unofficial pair playing for the Sydney Sixers against the Perth Scorchers. On 20 September 2020, during the second match of the 2020 Indian Premier League, Nicholas Pooran scored an unofficial pair playing for Kings XI Punjab against the Delhi Capitals."

At the end of the season, Auch were champions and thus automatically promoted to Top 14. They were eventually followed by Dax who beat La Rochelle in the final providing the second promotion place. Colomiers were relegated to Fédérale 1; Limoges finished in a relegation spot, but were reprieved when Gaillac were denied a professional license for the 2007–08 season due to serious financial problems. The 2006–07 season was also noted for Toulon's signing of top players such as Tana Umaga who played for them for a period during the season."

They have finished in second place at the 2010 Asian games being beaten by South Korea 7–6 in the final.\nName controversy.\nIn 1954, when the team first participated in the Asian Baseball Championship, it competed under the name of \"United Team of Taiwan\". Since the expulsion of the Republic of China from the United Nations in 1971, the National Baseball Team of the Republic of China was forced to compete internationally under the name of \"Chinese Taipei\" because of the People's Republic of China's diplomatic pressure through the One China Policy. In Taiwan it is both referred to as 中華隊 (hanyu pinyin: Zhōnghuá Duì; literally, Chinese team) or 台灣隊 (hanyu pinyin: Táiwān Duì; literally, team Taiwan )."

        "text": "Peter Ryan (born 23 March 1971) is an Australian former rugby league and rugby union footballer who played in the 1990s and 2000s. A Queensland State of Origin representative forward, he played ten seasons with the Brisbane Broncos and finished his career playing rugby union for the ACT Brumbies. Peter Ryan never lost a State of Origin match or series. He also was a part of the Australia A team which beat the British &amp; Irish Lions in 2001 in Gosford.\nBiography.\nRyan attended Downlands College in Toowoomba. After representing Australia in rugby union as a schoolboy, he first played rugby league for Wattles Warriors in the TRL (Toowoomba Rugby League), before playing for the Brisbane Rugby League premiership's Western Suburbs club, Ryan moved to the Broncos in 1990.\nProfessional playing career.\nIn the weeks following Brisbane's inaugural premiership win Ryan travelled with the club to England, where he played from the interchange bench in the 1992 World Club Challenge against British champions Wigan, helping Brisbane become the first NSWRL club to win the match in Britain. A handy utility forward, the following season he was part of Brisbane's 1993 Winfield Cup triumph.\nDuring the 1994 NSWRL season, Ryan played from the interchange bench for defending premiers Brisbane when they hosted British champions Wigan for the 1994 World Club Challenge. Also during the 1994 season, Ryan was suspended for three matches after being found guilty of biting South Sydney player Jason Bell.\nIn 1997 Ryan debuted for Queensland and was named Brisbane's player of the year in a premiership-winning season, Ryan's second title with the club. Only a suspension, which ruled him out of the 1998 NRL grand final, denied him the opportunity of winning a third premiership with the Broncos in 1998.\nAt the end of 1999, Ryan left the Brisbane club to play rugby union with the ACT Brumbies. Ryan was the first person in history to win grand finals in the NRL and the Super 12, as it was then known. This feat has since only been matched by Brad Thorn in 2008, and Will Chambers and Sonny Bill Williams in 2012.\nDuring 2001's pre-season, Wendell Sailor declared he was \"leaning towards\" switching codes from rugby league to rugby union following advice from former Broncos teammate Ryan.\nPost-playing.\nDuring the 2000s Ryan, who has been described by Craig Bellamy as \"one of the most devastating defenders to have played the game\", returned to the Brisbane Broncos as a part-time defence coach.\nRenowned during his playing days for his tough and uncompromising tackling technique, Ryan \nwas appointed as a 'contact' coach for the North Queensland Cowboys before switching to a similar role with the ACT Brumbies rugby union team in Super Rugby.\nHe was signed as defensive coach of the Queensland Reds for the 2019 season."

        "title": "Tom Curtis (American football)",
        "text": "Thomas Newton Curtis (born November 1, 1947) is an American former football safety. He played college football for the University of Michigan from 1967 to 1969. He was selected as a consensus All-American in 1969. He also broke Michigan's records for interceptions in a game, season, and career—none of which have been broken. He also set the NCAA career record with 431 return yards off interceptions. Curtis also played two seasons for the Baltimore Colts (1970–1971) which included the Colts' Super Bowl V winning team. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2005.\nEarly years.\nCurtis was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1947. He grew up in Aurora, Ohio, where he was the quarterback on the Aurora High School football team. He was a Class A All-Ohio quarterback in high school.\nUniversity of Michigan.\nCurtis played college football at the University of Michigan from 1967 to 1969. As a freshman in 1966, he played at the quarterback position on the all-freshman team.\nAs a sophomore, the Michigan coaching staff asked Curtis to move from the quarterback position to the safety position. Curtis told a reporter the following year, \"It took a little mental adjustment on my part, but it was all right with me. I wanted to play, and it was pretty obvious I wasn't going to beat out (Dick) Vidmer.\" Curtis started eight games at safety and one at cornerback for the 1967 Michigan Wolverines football team. On November 11, 1967, Curtis had three interceptions against Illinois, which remains tied for Michigan's single game record. During the 1967 season (his first as a defensive back), Curtis totaled seven interceptions to tie the Big Ten Conference record. In June 1968, Curtis received the Frederick C. Matthei Scholarship Award for sportsmanship off and on the field.\nAs a junior, Curtis started all 10 games for the 1968 team that finished the season with a record of 8-2. He totaled 10 interceptions in 1968, a mark that remains Michigan's single season record. He was selected as a first-team All-Big Ten player after the 1968 season.\nAs a senior, Curtis started all 11 games at safety for the 1969 team that was the first to be coached by Bo Schembechler. He intercepted eight passes for 156 yards in 1969. Two of his interceptions came in the Michigan's victory in the 1969 Ohio State game, regarded as one of the biggest upsets in college football history. He was selected as a consensus first-team All-American (selected as first-team by, among others, the United Press, Associated Press and \"Football News\").\nWith 25 career interceptions, Curtis still holds Michigan's all-time career interceptions record. (Charles Woodson is second with 18 interceptions.) His career total of 431 return yards off interceptions also broke the NCAA record set by Lynn Chandnois in the 1940s. At the end of the 2010 college football season, Curtis was tied for fourth place in career interceptions in NCAA Division I-A/FBS history. In an interview in 1968, Curtis said he knew how to think like a quarterback after playing five years at the position. He noted that his ability to think like a quarterback and read formations helped make him successful as a defensive back. Asked years later about his skill at intercepting passes, Curtis said, \"I'm not certain how I did it. It was a combination of instinct, great hands and quickness -- not speed.\"\nIn 2005, Curtis was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.\nProfessional football.\nCurtis was drafted by the Baltimore Colts in the 14th round (356th overall pick) of the 1970 NFL Draft. He appeared in 24 games for the Colts during the 1970 and 1971 seasons. In August 1972, Curtis was traded to the Los Angeles Rams for a future draft pick. He was cut by the Rams and picked up on waivers by the Miami Dolphins. He missed the Dolphins' undefeated 1972 season with a knee injury that kept him on injured reserve status. In late July 1973, Curtis announced his retirement from professional football.\nFamily and publishing career.\nCurtis met his wife, Debbie, in Miami, FL. They were married in approximately 1974 and live in Miami. They have two sons, Brad and Matthew, and a daughter, Tammi, who is married to former Michigan head coach Lloyd Carr's son, Jason Carr.\nCurtis owns and operates Curtis Publishing Company, one of the nation's largest privately owned publishing companies. The company's publications include Steelers Digest and River Cities Gazette. He was also the owner and publisher of \"Football News\"."

        "text": "David Jon Herman (September 3, 1941 – October 19, 2022) was an American professional football player who played offensive guard for ten seasons in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL). He played for the New York Jets from 1964 to 1973, having earlier played college football for Michigan State University.\nEarly life.\nHerman was born in Bryan, Ohio, on September 3, 1941. He was raised on a chicken farm in nearby Edon, Ohio, where he attended Edon High School. He then studied at Michigan State University, where he played football for the Spartans. He was selected by the New York Giants in the eighth round (110th overall) of the 1963 NFL Draft, but did not sign. He was also selected by the New York Jets in the 27th round (211th overall) of the 1964 AFL draft. He later revealed that he chose the Jets because they offered him $100 more than the Giants.\nProfessional career.\nDuring his 1964 rookie season, Herman played in five games, but missed the rest of the year due to an ankle injury. From 1965 to 1968, he started all 14 of the Jets' regular season games. He was named to the AFL All-Star team in 1968 and 1969.\nHerman was the starting right guard for the franchise during the 1968 season. His fellow starting offensive linemen that year included left tackle Winston Hill, left guard Randy Rasmussen, center John Schmidt, and right tackle Sam Walton. In preparation for Super Bowl III, Jets coach Weeb Ewbank moved Herman from right guard to right tackle to defend against Baltimore Colts' defensive lineman Bubba Smith. Bob Talamini replaced Herman at right guard and Sam Walton, a rookie, was benched. Herman's ability to neutralize the pass rush of Bubba Smith enabled Joe Namath to enjoy a solid game passing, hitting on 17 of 28 passes. It also helped open the running lanes for Jet fullback Matt Snell, who rushed for 121 yards as the Jets beat the heavily-favored Baltimore Colts 16–7.\nThe AFL merged with the NFL before the 1970 season. Herman again started all 14 games for the Jets in 1970 and 1971. He announced his retirement in April 1974.\nLater life.\nAfter retiring from professional football, Herman was employed as an account executive for Blair Television Company. He also worked in radio sports programming, partnering with Marty Glickman to announce Jets games on WOR Radio Network from 1974 to 1978. He later became a financial planner in New York City.\nHerman was diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy in 2014. He died on October 19, 2022, in Valhalla, Westchester County, New York. He was 81 years old."

He was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame on Long Island in the Football Category with the Class of 1992.\nHe also lost his Super Bowl ring in the ocean until a lifeguard found it and kept it. When the lifeguard died, someone going through his belongings found the ring."

        "text": "John Booker Walton (born October 4, 1947) is a former American football player and coach. He played professionally as a quarterback in the Continental Football League (CFL), World Football League (WFL), National Football League (NFL), and United States Football League (USFL). Walton played college football at Elizabeth City State University. He served two stints at the head football coach at Elizabeth City State, from 1980 to 1982 and 1989 to 1990, compiling a record of 25–24–2.\nIn 1969 Walton became the first African-American quarterback to lead a professional football team to a title, when the Indianapolis Capitols defeated the San Antonio Toros 44–38 (OT) in the Continental Football League final.\nCollege career.\nWalton played college football at Elizabeth City State University in the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) for four seasons (1965–1968). During his senior year (1968) he completed 114 of 204 passes for 1,400 yards and 16 touchdowns and led the Vikings to an 8–1 record. Walton was honored for his performance by being named to the All-CIAA football team. Walton graduated from Elizabeth City State University in 1969 with a bachelor's degree in physical education.\nProfessional playing career.\nNational Football League (1969-1972).\nWalton was not drafted coming out of college but was signed as a free agent by the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League in March 1969. He participated in several preseason games with the Rams in 1969–1972 but was never able to make the active roster during the season and spent most of his time on the taxi squad (practice team).\nContinental Football League (1969).\nIn 1969, after not making the Los Angeles Rams team, Walton played for the Indianapolis Capitols of the Continental Football League. His first pro football start came on September 2, 1969, when he led the Capitals to a 28–27 victory over the Norfolk Neptunes. Walton led the Capitals to the 1969 Continental Football League championship game (December 13, 1969) where he completed 14 of 30 passes for 217 yards and two touchdowns as Indianapolis defeated the San Antonio Toros in overtime 44–38 to become the 1969 Continental Football League champions. Walton was named to the ALL-CFL team and the MVP of the Capitals team. During the season Walton completed 109 of 234 passes for 1,713 yards and 17 touchdowns.\nWorld Football League (1974–1975).\nIn 1974, he served as a backup quarterback for the Chicago Fire of the World Football League. In 1975, he was the starting quarterback for the San Antonio Wings of the World Football League where he led the league in passing yards and touchdowns. Walton was named to the WFL All-Pro team. The World Football League officially suspended operations on October 22, 1975.\nNational Football League (1976–1979).\nBased on his success in the World Football League, Walton was recruited by new Philadelphia Eagles head coach Dick Vermeil to try out for the Eagles. Coincidentally, Vermeil was a coach for the Los Angeles Rams when Walton had first attempted to make the NFL. \nWalton was signed to a contract with the Philadelphia Eagles, and from 1976 to 1979 he would serve as a backup quarterback for the Eagles, playing in fifteen games over four seasons before leaving the NFL, at the age of 32, following the conclusion of the 1979 season.\nUnited States Football League (1983–1984).\nIn 1983, Walton was convinced by Dick Coury, the head coach of the Boston Breakers of the newly formed United States Football League (USFL), to give quarterbacking one more chance. Coury was familiar with Walton and his talent as Coury had been a coach on the Philadelphia Eagles staff during Walton's time there. Despite being 35 years old, and not having played a down of pro football since 1979, Walton agreed to join the USFL and become the starting quarterback for the 1983 Boston Breakers and the 1984 New Orleans Breakers, after the team moved to New Orleans following the 1983 season. Walton was one of the top passers in the USFL finishing second in the league in 1983 with 3,772 yards passing and third in the league with 20 touchdowns while leading the Breakers to an 11–7 record and a second-place finish in the USFL's Atlantic Division. In 1984, he finished fifth in the league in passing yards with 3,554. Walton owns the USFL record for most passing attempts in a season (589) which was set during the 1983 season.\nCoaching career.\nAfter leaving the NFL, Walton become head football coach at his alma mater, Elizabeth City State University, on January 15, 1980. He was the head coach from 1980 to 1982 compiling a 20–10–1 overall record (14–7 in the CIAA) He left Elizabeth City State in 1983 to return to pro football as the quarterback of the Boston Breakers. Walton return to Elizabeth City State as head coach in 1989 and remained in that post through the 1990 season.\nIn 1991, Walton was the offensive coordinator for the Raleigh-Durham Skyhawks of the World League of American Football (WLAF) under head coach Roman Gabriel, who played with Walton on the Rams and Eagles teams in the NFL and was his offensive coordinator for the Portland Breakers in 1985.\nPost-football career.\nFollowing his retirement from pro football, he returned to Elizabeth City, where he has served as a teacher and a member of the city council.\nECSU Hall of Fame.\nWalton was elected to the Elizabeth City State University Hall of Fame on October 25, 1985.\nCareer statistics.\n World Football League (WFL)\n Year Team GP ATT.

He played for the Chicago Bears, Los Angeles Rams, Green Bay Packers, and San Diego Chargers. After playing his option year with the Bears in 1971, Gordon became a free agent on May 1, 1972. The lateness of his signing with the Rams on October 12 after the start of the 1972 campaign was due to the uncertainty of compensation that the Bears were to receive. The Rams sent a 1974 first-round selection (20th overall–Dave Gallagher) to the Bears as compensation to complete the last of only four times the NFL exercised the Rozelle rule. He was one of the fifteen plaintiffs in \"Mackey v. National Football League\" in which Judge Earl R. Larson declared that the Rozelle rule was a violation of antitrust laws on December 30, 1975. In 2019, he was selected as one of the 100 greatest Bears of All-Time."

        "title": "Bob Rush (baseball)",
        "text": "Robert Ransom Rush (December 21, 1925 – March 19, 2011) was an American professional baseball pitcher who appeared in 417 games in Major League Baseball from to for the Chicago Cubs, Milwaukee Braves and Chicago White Sox. He threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . Rush was a National League All-Star selection in and . Although he was a starting pitcher for the Cubs for ten seasons, and worked in 339 total games for them, he did not reach the postseason until he was a Milwaukee Brave, when he appeared in the 1958 World Series.\nPitching career.\nChicago Cubs.\nBorn in Battle Creek, Michigan, Rush graduated from James Whitcomb Riley High School in South Bend, Indiana, and served in the United States Army during World War II. He was a combat veteran of the European theatre in Germany as a member of General George S. Patton's Third Army.\nHis pro career began in the Cub farm system in 1947. After only one year of minor-league seasoning, he joined the Cubs' MLB pitching staff. Pitching for a succession of poor teams, he lost 140 of the 250 decisions he earned as a Cub.\nRush tied for the National League lead in games lost with 20 in 1950, his first All-Star season. Two years later, he had the best year of his career, winning 17 games (third most in the league) with a stellar 2.70 earned run average, fifth-best in the Senior Circuit. Selected to his second All-Star team that year, he appeared in the 1952 midsummer classic, played July 8 at Shibe Park. Rush worked two innings, entering the game in the fourth with the NL ahead, 1–0. He allowed the rival American League to forge ahead with two runs and three hits. But in the very next half-inning, his National League teammates, led by fellow Cub Hank Sauer, who homered, got those runs back to regain the lead, 3–2. Rush then held the Junior Circuit off the scoreboard in the fifth inning. With the game having gone the required 4 innings, the National League—and Rush—were awarded a victory when the contest was ended by rain.\nIn addition to his 17–13 record in 1952, Rush also posted back-to-back over-.500 seasons in (13–11) and (13–10); his earned run averages of 3.50 and 3.19 during those seasons were ninth and seventh, respectively, in the National League.\nMilwaukee Braves.\nRush was traded to the defending world champion Braves in a five-player deal in December 1957. He then worked in 28 games, starting 20, and posted five complete games and two shutouts during the Braves' successful defense of their league pennant. He was Milwaukee's starting pitcher for Game 3 of the 1958 World Series at Yankee Stadium, with the Braves ahead in the Series, two games to none. Rush gave the Braves six strong innings, allowing the New York Yankees only three hits. But control problems during the fifth frame proved costly when Rush's three walks loaded the bases for Hank Bauer's two-run single. Those were all the runs Yankee starter Don Larsen needed in a 4–0 win. While the Braves captured Game 4 to build a three-games-to-one advantage, New York won Games 5–7 to take the world title away from Milwaukee.\nRush was primarily a relief pitcher for the Braves, making nine spot starts among his 30 appearances during the 154-game schedule and posting five victories and an effective 2.42 earned run average. The Braves found themselves embroiled in a three-way pennant fight with the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants that went down to the season's final weekend. When it ended, the Braves and Dodgers, both with 86–68 records, were deadlocked for the National League pennant, and a best-of-three tie-breaker series was necessary to determine a champion.\nThe Dodgers won Game 1 at Milwaukee, putting the Braves' backs against the wall. In Game 2, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on September 29, the Braves squandered a 5–2 lead when the Dodgers rallied for three runs in the bottom of the ninth inning, tying the score and sending the contest into extra innings. In the 11th frame, Rush was called into the game with the Braves in dire straights: the Dodgers had the bases loaded, with two out. But he retired Charlie Neal on a ground ball to secure the third out and preserve the tie. In the 12th inning, Milwaukee did not score in its half and Rush returned to the mound. He retired the first two Los Angeles hitters, Wally Moon and Stan Williams, but then his fortunes changed. Gil Hodges walked and was singled to second base by Joe Pignatano. Veteran Carl Furillo then made an infield hit to shortstop, and when Félix Mantilla threw wildly to first base, Hodges scored the pennant-deciding run on the error. Rush gave up no earned runs, but was charged with the loss.\nCareer statistics and trivia.\nRush split between the Braves and the American League White Sox, getting into 19 total games as a relief pitcher. He earned his final two MLB victories and a save for Milwaukee before being sent to the White Sox on June 11. He was given his unconditional release in November, ending his pitching career.\nAll told, Rush compiled a 127–152 won–lost record in MLB, with a 3.65 earned run average, 118 complete games and 16 shutouts. He earned eight saves coming out of the bullpen. In 2,410 innings pitched, he allowed 2,327 hits and 789 bases on balls. He struck out 1,244.\nRush was not afraid to throw brushback pitches. Alvin Dark recalled that when he played, some of his teammates would have trouble sleeping the night before they faced Rush in a game. It did not matter whether the hitter was left-handed or right-handed; Rush would knock them down no matter what side of the plate they stood on.\nOn June 11, 1950, Rush and pitcher Warren Spahn of the Boston Braves each stole a base against each other; no opposing pitchers again stole a base in the same game until May 3, 2004, when Jason Marquis and Greg Maddux repeated the feat.\nLate in the 1957 season, while Rush was warming up in the Wrigley Field bullpen during a game, a wild pitch he threw went into the stands and injured a spectator, who sued him and the Cubs, one of the few times in Major League Baseball history when a player has been named as a defendant by a fan injured by an object that left the field. The court granted Rush summary judgement which was affirmed on appeal a decade later; however it held that the Baseball Rule, which generally immunizes teams against suits by fans injured by foul balls who sit in seats outside the backstop's protection, did not extend to an errantly \"thrown\" ball and that a jury could decide if the Cubs had adequately anticipated the risk of one leaving the field and striking a fan.\nBob Rush died in Mesa, Arizona, the Cubs' longtime spring training home, at age 85."

For these efforts, he was a recipient of the Olympic Order, the highest honor given by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).\nBaseball career.\nSmith graduated from Greenville College in Greenville, Illinois in 1957. He went to work at the college a few years after graduation as a physical education instructor and baseball coach, in 1961.\nSmith began his work with the Olympics when he began to work on the United States Olympic Committee in 1977.\nSmith was elected President of the United States Baseball Federation in 1980 (until 1989) and then quickly ascended to the presidency of the International Baseball Federation/International Baseball Association (IBA) the following year at the Baseball World Cup held in Japan. At the IBA's Congress in 1988, held in conjunction with the Nicaragua Baseball World Cup, Smith was re-elected as president, and he held the office until 1993. That year, he was succeeded by Aldo Notari of Italy.\nDuring Dr. Smith's time as international leader of amateur baseball, he coordinated 26 world baseball tournaments, continued to serve on the United States Olympic Committee in varying capacities until 1990, and directed the baseball competitions at the Olympic Games in 1984 in Los Angeles, 1988 in Seoul, and 1992 in Barcelona.\nSmith is often acknowledged as being responsible for baseball becoming an official Olympic sport. Baseball was allowed as a demonstration sport at the 1984 Los Angeles Games and Smith hoped that it would be played for medals in 1988 in Seoul. He and baseball's supporters in the effort did not make that goal, but nevertheless Smith's time as president was unique in that he saw the end to decades of work by baseball enthusiasts when the International Olympic Committee decided to add baseball as an official sport of the Games for 1992. He oversaw the winning of the first-ever gold medal for baseball, won by Cuba in Barcelona in 1992. The International Olympic Committee voted in 2006 to drop baseball and softball in the Olympics, beginning with the 2012 Games in London.\nGreenville College presidency.\nSmith served as a key development officer for Greenville College before being hired as vice president for Institutional Advancement. While serving in that capacity, Smith was chosen by the GC Board of Trustees as the ninth President of Greenville College. He retired in 1998 and has since worked with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes in southern Illinois.\nSmith and his wife Joanna celebrated their 60th anniversary on August 30, 2017. The two had met as students at Greenville College in 1955 and married in San Diego in 1957. Joanna died on June 5, 2018, at the age of 81.\nHonors.\nDr. Smith was given the Olympic Order, the highest honor given by the International Olympic Committee, for his efforts to bring gold medal baseball to fruition. It is awarded to \"any person who has illustrated the Olympic ideal through his action, has achieved remarkable merit in the sporting world or has rendered outstanding services to the Olympic Movement, either through his own personal achievement or his own contribution to the development of sport.”\nSmith was elected to the NAIA Hall of Fame as a baseball coach.\nThe NAIA Baseball Coaches Executive Committee created an award for baseball coaches and administrators, the \"Robert E. Smith Achievement Award,\" with Smith as the first winner in 1999. The award honors \"unselfish promotion of NAIA baseball\" and is presented annually at the NAIA Baseball Hall of Fame and Honors Luncheon. Ish has also won the Turley award, which is an award of service. \nAs a lasting reminder of his contributions to the college, Greenville College plays its baseball games on Robert E. Smith Field south of campus."

        "text": "The men's individual road race at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, was held on Sunday July 29, 1984. There were 135 participants from 43 nations in the race over 190.20 km, on a course in Mission Viejo, California. The maximum number of cyclists per nation was four. 55 cyclists finished. The event was won by Alexi Grewal of the United States, the nation's first medal in the men's individual road race. All three nations represented on the podium were there for the first time in the event; Canada with Steve Bauer's silver and Norway with Dag Otto Lauritzen's bronze joined the Americans.\nBackground.\nThis was the 12th appearance of the event, previously held in 1896 and then at every Summer Olympics since 1936. It replaced the individual time trial event that had been held from 1912 to 1932 (and which would be reintroduced alongside the road race in 1996). The late 1970s and early 1980s had seen a shift in power in the sport from Western Europe to the world's superpowers, with Eastern Europe (particularly Poland) more generally also rising. With the Soviet-led boycott, the host Americans were favored. Davis Phinney was considered \"the best sprinter on the US team\" but \"not a great climber\"; the hilly course did not favor him. Alexi Grewal nearly missed being able to compete, testing positive for the stimulant phenylethylamine and being suspended 10 days before the Games; he successfully appealed and was reinstated, on the ground that the test was not able to distinguish between phenylethylamine and albuterol (which Grewal took for asthma).\nBermuda, Belize, the Cayman Islands, Cyprus, Puerto Rico, Saudi Arabia, and Uganda each made their debut in the men's individual road race. Great Britain made its 12th appearance in the event, the only nation to have competed in each appearance to date.\nCompetition format and course.\nThe mass-start race was on a 190.2 kilometre course over 12 laps of a circuit in Mission Viejo. The course was hilly.\nResults.\nGrewal and Bauer separated from the lead pack on lap 11. They \"never had a large lead\" over the next pair, Lauritzen and Sæther, but were always clear of them. Grewal beat Bauer in the final sprint by \"less than a wheel.\""

        "title": "Tom Thacker (basketball)",
        "text": "Thomas Porter Thacker (born November 2, 1939) is an American former basketball player. He played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Cincinnati Royals and the Boston Celtics from 1963 to 1968, and from 1968 to 1971, for the American Basketball Association's Indiana Pacers. He is the only player to have played on an NCAA championship team, an ABA championship team, and an NBA championship team.\nEarly life.\nThacker was born in and grew up in Covington, Kentucky across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, the son of William and Velma Arvin Thacker. He attended Our Savior's High School until integration closed it in 1956. He then attended the all-black William Grant High School, where he played basketball. He averaged 31.7 points per game as a junior and led the team to a 26–5 record. As a senior, he averaged 33.8 points as the team went 31–7. He scored 36 points in his final high school game as the team lost the Kentucky state championship game, 85–84.\nIn 1959 he needed a few credits to earn his degree, so he attended Holmes High School during the summer and graduated.\nCollege career.\nThacker attended the University of Cincinnati and played three varsity seasons for the Bearcats under coach Ed Jucker. As a sophomore in 1960–61, he averaged 12.3 points per game and was named All-Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) as the Bearcats won the league title. The Bearcats finished the season with a record of 27–3 and, on March 25, 1961, Cincinnati, led by the balanced attack of Thacker, Bob Wiesenhahn, Tony Yates, Paul Hogue and Carl Bouldin, won the NCAA Championship with a 70–65 overtime win over the Ohio State Buckeyes.\nAs a junior in 1961–62, Thacker averaged 11.0 points per game and was again All-MVC. The Bearcats again captured the MVC and posted a 29–2 record. With Ron Bonham and George Wilson replacing the departed Wiesenhahn and Bouldin, the Bearcats again captured the NCAA title on March 24, 1962, again over Ohio State, 71–59.\nAs a senior in 1962–63, he averaged 15.8 points per game, led the team in assists with 4.0 per game, and was named the team MVP. He was also named All-MVC for the third consecutive season. In addition, he was a consensus first-team All-American along with teammate Bonham. The Bearcats, with the same starting lineup as the year before except for Larry Shingleton replacing the departed Hogue, won the league crown yet again and, for the third straight season, advanced to the NCAA championship game. However, on March 23, 1963, the Bearcats lost to Loyola University Chicago.\nProfessional career.\nThacker was chosen in the first round (fifth overall) of the 1963 NBA draft as a territorial pick by the Cincinnati Royals. During his three seasons with the Royals, he played about nine minutes per game as a backup guard, averaging 2.8, 2.5, and 3.7 points per game, respectively during the 1963–64 through 1965–66 seasons. On May 1, 1966, he was drafted by the Chicago Bulls in the NBA expansion draft, but he decided to retire and did not play that season.\nOn August 4, 1967, he returned to the NBA and was signed as a free agent by the Boston Celtics. It turned out to be a fortuitous trade for Thacker. Averaging about 12 minutes per game and 4.2 points and 2.5 rebounds per game, he earned a championship ring as the Celtics won the NBA title in a six-game finals series over the Los Angeles Lakers. He also posted a career single-game high of 17 points twice, on February 11, 1968, against the Lakers and again on March 7 against the Bulls.\nAfter Thacker's fourth NBA season, on May 6, 1968, he was drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA expansion draft. However, he opted to play in the American Basketball Association (ABA) for the Indiana Pacers. In 1968–69, playing just 18 games, he averaged 5.4 points, 3.7 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game, all career personal bests. In 1969–70, he played 70 games, averaging 2.7 points per game and helped the Pacers capture the ABA championship in six games over the Los Angeles Stars. In his third and final ABA season of 1970–71, he played eight games and his seven-year professional career ended.\nCoaching career.\nHe became the first African-American coach at the University of Cincinnati, leading the women's basketball program from 1974 to 1978. Thacker was the second coach for the Cincinnati Bearcats women's basketball team and would go on to have an 55–43 record over four seasons, leading three winning campaigns during his coaching time.\nPersonal life.\nThacker earned both a bachelor's degree and a master's degree from the University of Cincinnati. He is also a member of the Beta Eta chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.\nThacker owns his own small business, Tom Thacker Enterprises, in Cincinnati.\nHe has served as deputy director of the Cincinnati Urban League, and he also served as a teacher with Cincinnati Public Schools. In 1986, he was inducted into the Northern Kentucky Sports Hall of Fame and, in 1989, into the Northern Kentucky Black Hall of Fame.\nHe was inducted into the Ohio Basketball Hall of Fame at the 11th Annual Ceremony on May 21, 2016, in Columbus.\nCareer statistics.\nNBA/ABA.\nSource\nRegular season.\n!

She was not finished in time to participate in the First World War and was sold for scrap in 1928.\nDesign and description.\nThe \"Aberdare\" sub-class were enlarged versions of the original Hunt-class ships with a more powerful armament.

These countries regularly compete in the Women's Rugby League World Cup which has been in operation since 2000.\nGoverning Bodies.\nInternational Rugby League.\nAs with men's rugby league, the international game and national governing bodies are overseen by the International Rugby League.\nNational Bodies.\nAustralian Women's Rugby League.\nThe Australian Women's Rugby League is the governing body of female rugby league in Australia and other parts of Oceania and was established in 1993. It currently falls under the Australian Rugby League which oversees its running and management but it took the association five years to be recognized by the ARL.\nThe AWRL is run at state level by its own governing organisations in the Queensland Women's Rugby League, New South Wales Women's Rugby League, Canberra Women's Rugby League and the Western Australian Women's Rugby League. The main women's competitions in Australia are the National Rugby League Women's Premiership, Sydney Metropolitan Women's Rugby League and the Brisbane and District Women's Rugby League.\nThe AWRL also runs the Australia women's national rugby league team.\nRugby Football League.\nThe Rugby Football League is the governing body of female rugby league in the United Kingdom; although some activity is run by the independent Women's Amateur Rugby League Association established in 1985. With women's rugby becoming increasingly popular, the RFL has taken more control in running women's competitions.\nAt the beginning of the 2006 season there were between thirty and forty female-only rugby league clubs running in England, not including clubs that have teams of both sexes. The majority of these clubs are located in Lancashire and Yorkshire.\nThe RFL began control of the female sport in 2013 with the launch of the RFL Women's Rugby League. This became the RFL Women's Super League in 2017 as the top level women's rugby league competition in the United Kingdom.\nAt international level the Great Britain women's national rugby league team represented the whole of Great Britain; however in 2006 the RFL announced that after the 2007 All Golds Tour the Great Britain team would no longer compete on a regular basis, favouring national teams for the home nations of England, Scotland, and Wales.\nNew Zealand Rugby League.\nWomen's rugby league in New Zealand is controlled by the \"New Zealand Rugby League\". The national side is called the Kiwi Ferns. The NZRL Women's National Tournament is a competition for female rugby league teams. Women have been playing rugby in New Zealand since the 19th century.\nDomestic competitions.\nAustralia.\nThe NRL Women's Premiership is the top tier national competition. In the second tier are two state competitions in New South Wales and Queensland. There are tackle competitions at a local level in several areas of Sydney and Brisbane, and in regional areas of New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. &lt;br&gt;\nThere are also competitions in the capital cites of the Northern Territory, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia and these states send teams to the National Championships.\nThe New South Wales Rugby League has also promoted and supported non-tackle League tag competitions in Sydney and regional areas since the early 2010s.\nState of Origin is a state representative series played by Queensland and New South Wales. This annual competition began in 1999 as an Interstate Challenge with selections based on the players' state of residence. In 2018, this changed to Origin. In 2023, the National Rugby League extended what had usually been a single annual match to a two-match series.\nGreat Britain.\nThe top tier of rugby league in Great Britain is the RFL Women's Super League which operates a promotion and relegation system with the RFL Women's Championship below it. The Women's Challenge Cup is Great Britain's primary cup competition.\nInternational.\nThe following list of nations that compete, or have competed, internationally in women's rugby league. &lt;br&gt;\nTable last updated: 28 April 2024.\nNotes:\nWomen's Rugby League World Cup.\nThe Women's Rugby League World Cup was first held in Great Britain during 2000 to coincide with the men's Rugby League World Cup. Australia, Great Britain and eventual winners New Zealand took part. New Zealand also won the second and third World Cups: a nine team tournament held at North Harbour Stadium, in the Auckland suburb of Albany in 2003; and an eight team tournament held at the Sunshine Coast Stadium and, for the final, Suncorp Stadium in 2008.\nIn the 2013 World Cup, the Australian Jillaroos won the cup, breaking New Zealand's 13 year winning streak. Australia again beat New Zealand in the 2017 World Cup Final.\nThe World Cup is played every 4 years. Delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the most recent World Cup included eight teams and was held in November 2022 in England. It was played alongside Men's and Wheelchair tournaments. Australia won the tournament for the third time, all three in succession."

        "title": "Indian Cricket League",
        "text": "The Indian Cricket League (ICL) was a short-lived cricket league that ran from 2007 to 2009. It was sponsored by Zee Entertainment Enterprises, a media company. The ICL had two seasons, featuring four international teams and nine domestic teams from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The matches were played in the Twenty20 format, which was new and exciting at the time. The ICL also planned to have a 50-over tournament, but it never happened.\nThe ICL faced significant opposition from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the International Cricket Council (ICC). The BCCI did not approve of the ICL and launched its own rival league, the Indian Premier League (IPL), in 2008. The IPL was more popular and successful than the ICL, attracting more players, sponsors and fans.\nThe BCCI also banned the players who joined the ICL from playing for their national teams or in any other official tournaments. This was a big blow for the ICL, as many of its players were former or current stars of international cricket. Some of them tried to return to the BCCI fold, but they had to face legal and financial hurdles. Combined with pressure from the more popular IPL, these issues caused the ICL to collapse in 2009, ending its brief and controversial existence.\nBackground.\n'Rebel' cricket leagues and fixtures played without backing from international boards and the International Cricket Council had been attempted before. Most notably, World Series Cricket, introduced in 1977 by broadcasting tycoon Kerry Packer, had proved the viability of cricket as a commercial product despite the league's short lifespan. In the 1980s, many international cricketers toured South Africa whilst the country was under a sporting boycott due to apartheid, often sponsored by private companies. Both these attempts resulted in pushback from international cricket authorities. World Series Cricket were the subject of litigation, and were not perimitted to use recognised cricket stadiums or language like 'Test Match', so had to instead use stadiums intended for other sports and invent new terminology such as 'Supertest'. In the case of the latter, many cricketers received bans from their respective national teams for participating in these tours. As a result, the tours eventually came to an end, a few years before apartheid ended in South Africa and the sporting boycott was lifted.\nIn the early 2000s, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) were looking for a way to market the game to a younger audience. Their solution was a new twenty-over competition to be played between counties. The resulting Twenty20 Cup, later renamed the T20 Blast, was a success and drew large crowds during its first season in 2003. Similar competitions sprung up in Pakistan, Australia and the West Indies. Eventually, the ICC sanctioned the first official Men's T20 World Cup in 2007.\nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India sent a young side to participate in the World Cup, due to their skepticism over the format's viability. Despite their inexperience, the Indian side won the tournament. Two months later, the inaugural season of the Indian Cricket League began without backing from the BCCI, who deemed the participants 'rebels' and excluded them from the Indian side.\nLeague structure.\nEach team was coached by a former international cricketer and composed of four international, two Indian and eight budding domestic players. Essel Group also planned to set up cricket academies all over the country. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) was assured that it was free to draw from ICL's talent pool. The league became active in November 2007 with matches in the Twenty20 format.\nFormer international cricketers including Tony Greig, Dean Jones and Kiran More were hired as board members of the Indian Cricket League. The board positions were to be paid positions.\nICL World teams.\nThe ICL World teams participated in an additional competition, the ICL World Series. They did not play against the city teams.\nICL World XI\nICL India\nICL Pakistan\nICL Bangladesh\nSupport for the league.\nThe ICL received some support from unexpected quarters. There was a fear that lack of access to infrastructure, like the premier cricket stadiums, would limit the success of the operation of the league, but support from various government bodies boosted the league. Camps were held at Mayajaal in Chennai, a private resort with adequate cricket facilities. The then head of Indian Railways Lalu Prasad Yadav showed his backing by opening all the cricket stadiums controlled by the Indian Railways to the league. Describing the ICL as a \"good initiative\", Prasad issued a statement saying that the BCCI and ICL should each come up with a cricket team and play against each other to show who's the best. The state government of West Bengal also agreed to rent its cricket grounds, notably Eden Gardens, to the league. In Ahmedabad, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation provided its Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium for matches.\nControversy.\nBCCI Response.\nThe BCCI refused to recognise the ICL as a cricket league, and criticised Kiran More and Kapil Dev for joining the ICL. Kapil Dev's association with ICL was seen by the establishment as a conflict of interest as he was also the chairman of National Cricket Academy, a BCCI owned cricket facility. On 21 August 2007 Kapil Dev was sacked from his NCA post. Subhash Chandra had earlier stated that the ICL will go ahead regardless of the BCCI's stance. The International Cricket Council gave a statement through its chief executive, Malcolm Speed, that the ICC would not recognize the ICL unless the BCCI chooses to recognise it. The ICC looks at the ICL as an issue to be sorted out by the BCCI. On 25 July 2012 Kapil Dev informed BCCI that he had resigned from the ICL.\nFaced with the threat of young players joining the ICL, the BCCI jacked up prize money for winners, runners-up and losing semi-finalists across all tournaments. An average domestic cricketer can hope to make around ₹35,000 per match day from the season of 2007–08: more than double the ₹16,000 they got in 2005–06. The BCCI has also planned to do away with honorary selectors, who will be paid professionals from September 2008 onwards.\nThe BCCI started its own international Twenty20 league. The official league, which launched in April 2008, is called the Indian Premier League. The league model is based on the franchise model of the National Football League and Major League Baseball in the US.\nICL takes BCCI to court.\nIn August 2007, the ICL filed a petition against the BCCI in the Delhi High Court accusing the BCCI of threatening and intimidating them and other state organisations, and asked the court to stop BCCI from interfering with its attempts to sign up players for its tournaments. It also petitioned that the BCCI stop trying to \"out-hire\" cricket stadiums in India that are owned by the state governments, in anti-competitive attempts to stop the ICL from using them to play matches.\nOn 27 August 2007, the Delhi High Court ruled in favour of the ICL. In its ruling, the Delhi High Court said that players should not suffer in the battle between corporate giants. The court has issued notices to all corporate sponsors, the state cricket associations &amp; the BCCI against terminating valid contracts of players joining the ICL.\nThe Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission (MRTPC) of India had asked its Director-General of Investigation to do an initial investigation into the BCCI's action against players who had joined the ICL. The investigation was based on media reports of the BCCI giving an open statement that it would ban players who join ICL. It was also reported in the media that all state associations, under direction from the BCCI, have cancelled contracts with players.\nPressure on players from other national organisations.\nIn considering rejoining the ICL former England wicketkeeper Paul Nixon was said to have put his career in jeopardy because any player that signs up with the ICL, which does not have official status from the International Cricket Council, risks losing their registration.\nThe addition of a new team from Dhaka in Bangladesh, consisting largely of Bangladesh internationals caused more controversy as the cricket board of that country banned the players for 10 years for joining the 'rebel' ICL. Faced with the departure of so many players the board appealed to other Bangladeshi players to reject the new ICL team, stay loyal to the board and embrace the opportunity to play for their country.\nDownfall of the ICL.\nThe future of ICL became uncertain when BCCI banned ICL players from playing international matches. Since then many ICL players have returned to their national team including famous players like Shane Bond (retired) and Abdul Razzaq (also retired).\nBCCI after seeing the success of ICL wanted to start their own league called IPL. Due to this, the BCCI began to ban players and stadiums associated with the ICL.\nShortly before the conclusion of the inaugural tournament, the ICL announced its plans for expansion, which include a fifty over tournament in February 2008, and the expansion of the ICL Indian Championship to eight teams for the second tournament, due to be held in September and October 2008. However, the ICL eventually came to an end after all its players dropped out. This was because of the offer of amnesty given by BCCI to players choosing to leave the ICL.\nTransparency issues.\nIndependent analysts have had difficulty gauging the financial viability of the ICL due to the lack of transparency of the league's operations. Terms of contracts are hidden and advertising revenue from match telecasts – considered to be a major contributor to revenues – have never been disclosed. Because they are unsanctioned by the ICC, the teams do not have access to the best facilities across the whole country or access to the best players, limiting their ability to generate high gate revenues. This lack of transparency leads to questions regarding the overall viability of the ICL's business model."

        "text": "The 2007 Masters Tournament was the 71st Masters Tournament, held April 5–8 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia. Zach Johnson won his first major championship, two strokes ahead of runners-up Retief Goosen, Rory Sabbatini, and Tiger Woods. Cool temperatures and gusty winds on the weekend resulted in high scores for the field; Johnson's 289 (+1) tied for the highest winning score ever.\nJohnson's victory dispelled the notion that only long-hitters could win the Masters. He did not reach a single par five hole in two during the entire tournament, yet played the par fives better than anyone in the field with 11 birdies and no bogeys.\nThis was the final Masters appearance for two-time champion Seve Ballesteros.\nField.\nThe Masters has the smallest field of the four major championships; only 97 players were invited to compete in the 2007 tournament.

Special foreign invitation\nHideto Tanihara\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, April 5, 2007\"\nBilly Mayfair and Ian Poulter were the first competitors to tee off in the 2007 Masters. Both posted scores that were over par. Poulter posted a 75 (+3) and Mayfair a 76 (+4). The course proved to be playing tough, as many big names faltered on the opening day; Ernie Els finished with a 78 (+6), and defending champion Phil Mickelson looked set to get the same score, but two late birdies salvaged a poor round at 76 (+4). World number two Jim Furyk managed a 75 to keep himself in contention. Gary Player, playing in his 50th Masters, could only manage an 83 (+11); two-time winner Seve Ballesteros was at 86 (+14). Tim Clark, the 2006 runner-up, produced a wonderful shot on the 18th hole. At even par, he pulled his second shot to the left of the green and chose to putt. His ball went all the way round the green before it dropped for a birdie and 71. The leaders after the first round were Justin Rose and Brett Wetterich at 69. Rose set a new lowest putts record, needing just twenty. One of the reasons for this was his superb chipping which included a holed bunker shot on the 5th to pick up his second birdie after one at the 3rd. He then crisply rolled home another birdie at 14 to move to three-under par and made a fine save at the last having found a greenside bunker. Wetterich produced five birdies during his round. The chasing pack consisted of David Howell who eagled the 15th to post a two-under 70, and major winner David Toms. Behind them at 71, in addition to Clark, were Vaughn Taylor, Zach Johnson, Rich Beem, and J. J. Henry.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, April 6, 2007\"\nOnly three were under par at the halfway point of the tournament. Wetterich and Clark held the 36-hole lead at 142 (-2). Clark was the only man in the field to shoot under par in both rounds (71-71). Taylor held solo third place a stroke back at 143. Despite only three being under par, several golfers were within striking distance. Vijay Singh, the 2000 champion, was among a group of four at even par, and Pádraig Harrington was among a group of six at 145 (+1). The cut was at 152 (+8) and among those to miss it were notables Sergio García and Els. Fred Couples, the 1992 champion, parred the final hole to make the cut in his 23rd consecutive appearance to tie Gary Player's Masters record.\nAmateurs: Kelly (+10) Ramsay (+12), Guerrier (+20), Watabu (+21), Womack (+21).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, April 7, 2007\"\nThe third round saw the worst playing conditions in many years at Augusta on an unseasonably cool day with wind gusts reaching . The conditions were clearly a factor as no scores broke 70 for the round. Despite a one-over 73, Stuart Appleby took the 54-hole lead at 218 (+2). Four-time champion Tiger Woods was able to climb the leaderboard into a tie for second with an even par round. Rose shot 75 (+3) to settle into the tie for second with Woods. Retief Goosen was the only player to break par on Saturday with a two-under 70; he made the cut on the number at 152 (+8) on Friday. The final pair both shot in the 80s; Wetterich carded 83 (+11) and Clark an 80 (+8) to fall out of contention. After the third round, fourteen golfers were within four strokes of the lead.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, April 8, 2007\"\nSummary.\nJohnson completed a Cinderella story with a three-under 69 to claim his first major title. He captured the green jacket with three birdies over his final six holes, and became the third Masters champion to win the tournament with a score above par. The others were Sam Snead in 1954 and Jack Burke Jr. in 1956, also at 289 (+1). Johnson matched the round of the day and was able to hold off a group of three, including Woods, that finished two strokes back. Woods lost a major for the first time in which he held the lead at some point in the final round. However, since he was a stroke behind Appleby coming into the day, his 12–0 record when leading or tied at the start of the final round of a major remained intact. Appleby started off with a double bogey and added another at #12; his 75 (+3) led to a tie for seventh. South Africans Goosen and Rory Sabbatini both shot 69 to finish in a tie for second with Woods. Justin Rose was the last player to have a realistic chance of matching Johnson's clubhouse score, getting within 1 stroke at +2 with birdies at 14 and 16. However he made a double bogey on 17 to fall 3 strokes back into a tie for 5th. Defending champion Mickelson finished ten strokes back at 299 (+11), tied for 24th.\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nPar 3 Contest.\nMark O'Meara, 1998 champion, won the annual Par 3 contest, held on Wednesday, April 4."

        "title": "Bob Bailey (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Robert Allan \"Bashin' Bob\" Bailey (May 29, 1931 – October 24, 2003) was a Canadian ice hockey right winger. He played for the Toronto Maple Leafs, Detroit Red Wings, and Chicago Black Hawks of the National Hockey League between 1953 and 1958. The rest of his career, which lasted from 1947 to 1968, was spent in various minor leagues. During his career he was involved in trades for over twenty players, including three separate trades for Bill Dineen. He was inducted into the Dayton Hockey Hall of Fame in 1970 for his time with the Dayton Gems of the International Hockey League, where he played the last four seasons of his career.\nProfessional career.\nMinor league hockey.\nBailey had his first taste of professional hockey at the age of 16 when he played 22 games with the Windsor Hettche Spitfires of the International Hockey League. He performed well, but many on the coaching staff felt he needed more time to develop. He continued his play with the Stratford Kroehlers and didn't return to the IHL until the 1951–52 season, when he played in the final two games of the season for the Toledo Mercurys. However that was all it took. The Detroit Red Wings owned the rights to Bailey and decided to trade him to the Cleveland Barons along with his brother, John Bailey for the rights to Lou Jankowski and Bill Dineen in June 1951. In the American Hockey League Bailey flourished, playing in 54 games, amassing 46 points and a team-high 115 penalty minutes. That's all it took, as the Toronto Maple Leafs had had their eye on young Bailey and wanted to see what he could do. On May 30, 1953, Toronto traded Chuck Blair and 30,000 USD to Cleveland for Bailey and Gerry Foley.\nReaching the NHL.\nAfter spending a short amount of time in the Maple Leafs' farm system with the of the QHL and the Pittsburgh Hornets, Bailey made his debut with the Toronto Maple Leafs in the middle of the 1953–54 season. He played in 48 games and scored 9 points, but also joined the Leafs' short playoff run against the Detroit Red Wings. Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard had a short altercation with the young rookie when he butt-ended Bailey with his stick after Bailey slammed Richard into the boards. Throughout the game Richard repeatedly tried to renew his attack on Bailey and even refused to leave the ice after a slash when ordered by the referee. The following two seasons would be much less dramatic as they saw Bailey splitting time between the Maple Leafs and the Hornets, never really finding his scoring touch when brought up to the big leagues. While playing for the Hornets in 1956, Bailey was suspended from the remainder of the playoffs and fined US$575 for assaulting referee Jerry Olinski on April 2.\nOn May 28, 1956, Bailey was traded along with Bob Sabourin to the Springfield Indians for 11,000 USD. On September 22, 1956, Bailey was traded to the Detroit Red Wings for cash, but would remain in Springfield on loan. He played 40 games for the Indians before being called up to replace injured players for the Detroit Red Wings. He joined the Red Wings for their short playoff run against the Boston Bruins. The 1957–58 season saw Bailey playing for the Chicago Blackhawks after being acquired in the NHL Intra-League Draft on June 5, 1957. He would only play in 28 games before again being traded, this time with Jack McIntyre, Nick Mickoski and Hec Lalonde for Earl Reibel, Billy Dea, Lorne Ferguson and Bill Dineen on December 17, 1957. Bailey again joined Detroit for the playoffs and again had a post-season altercation. During the semi-finals against the Montreal Canadiens, there was a bench-clearing brawl that all started in the second period, precipitated by Bailey charging Montreal's goaltender, Jacques Plante. To settle the teams (and the crowd), referee Frank Udvari sent both teams to their dressing rooms and added the 5:22 remaining in that second period to the third stanza. The Canadiens ended up winning 2-1 and knocked Detroit out of the playoffs in four games. The 1957–58 season would be Bailey's last in the NHL.\nOn July 31, 1958, Bailey was again traded to Cleveland from Detroit, this time for cash. However, Bailey picked up his scoring game for the 1958–59 season and finished third on the team in scoring and first again in penalty minutes. The following season saw Bailey playing only five more games for the Barons before being traded for Bill Dineen once again, this time to the Buffalo Bisons on October 20, 1959. He would finish out the season in Buffalo at almost a point-per-game pace. In 1960, Bailey was involved in another multiplayer trade on June 7. Bailey, Glen Skov, the rights to Danny Lewicki, Terry Gray and Lorne Ferguson went to the Montreal Canadiens for Cecil Hoekstra, Reggie Fleming, Ab McDonald and Bob Courcy. However, he wouldn't see ice time with Montreal as he would spend time with Montreal's minor leagues. Bailey spent the 1960–61 season with the Quebec Aces and the start of the 1961–62 season with the Pittsburgh Hornets before again being traded. This time Bailey would be switching leagues as Pittsburgh traded him to the San Francisco Seals of the Western Hockey League for Gord Redahl on February 27, 1962.\nOn the Seals, Bailey failed to put up large numbers and was sent to the Philadelphia Ramblers of the Eastern Hockey League. He had his best offensive season to date with the Ramblers, scoring 26 goals for a total of 91 points during the 1962–63 season. He also helped head coach for a short time that season along with Hugh Currie and Doug Adam. In 1963 Bailey was let go, but found a home with the Fort Wayne Komets of the International Hockey League.\nEnding on a high note.\nAt the end of the 1963–64 season, Bailey was involved in his last professional trade when he was traded to the Dayton Gems for Roger Maisonneuve in November 1964.\nThis turned out to be a great fit as Bailey put up his best numbers ever, scoring a career-high and team-leading 132 points in the 1965–66 season. In his final season, Bailey was suspended after slugging referee Billy Purcell in a game at Fort Wayne on December 9, 1967. This is what helped convince Bailey to retire in 1968. He had spent four years with the Gems in which he scored 319 points, almost half his total amassed career points.\nAfter hockey.\nBailey was honored on March 17, 1970, when he was inducted into the Dayton Hockey Hall of Fame. Long time Fort Wayne General Manager Ken Ullyot called him \"the last of the great stick handlers.\" Gems' goaltender Pat Rupp said Bailey was \"the best to ever play hockey in Dayton.\""

        "text": "Denis Reginald Donoghue (1926–1993) was a champion Australian rugby league footballer, coach and administrator who starred in seven straight grand finals, winning 5, with the South Sydney Rabbitohs during their second 'Golden Era' (1949-1955), represented Sydney, New South Wales and Australia during the years of 1948–1957. He also fought as a boxer.\nPlaying career.\nClub career.\nReturning from the War where he was a Royal Australian Navy Boxing champion, Donoghue commenced the shortest lower grade career in South Sydney history in 1948. After two games of third grade and just one of second, Donoghue cemented a first grade berth just four games into his career and stayed in the first grade team until retirement. His aggressive and relentless style of play ensured his rapid rise in the game.\nA Rabbitohs legend and \"favorite son\", Denis Donoghue played ten seasons for South Sydney between 1948 and 1957, playing 171 first grade games for the club and became a multi premiership winner with them.\nHe won 'man of the match' honours in Souths Sydney's losing Grand Final side against St George Dragons in 1949, and starred in their subsequent premierships in 1950 and 1951. Donoghue played in the controversial 1952 Grand Final loss to Western Suburbs, where the referee was accused of costing Souths the game. Winning back to back premierships in 1953–54, his last grand final appearance was in Souths miracle 1955 campaign. Losing stars Greg Hawick and Clive Churchill mid season and running equal last, the bunnies won 11 consecutive games to take out the championship, beating Newtown by a single point.\nDenis Donoghue was a fearsome, tough forward, and a crowd favourite at Redfern. Judges like Tom Goodman were quoted in the press at the time stating \"he was the best front rower in the code\". A rock-solid defender and strong runner of the ball, his specialty was scrummaging. He was the backbone of the South Sydney Rabbitohs pack, playing in seven grand finals and winning six of them.\nSouth Sydney's unbroken run of grand final appearances that began in 1949 stopped in 1956 when they lost the qualifying final to Balmain by 3 points in controversial circumstances. Donoghue played one final season after this.\nHe retired to the Wollongong competition in 1957, playing as captain-coach for one year at the Collegians, before returning to the South Sydney Rabbitohs as first grade coach for the next five seasons.\nDonoghue took up the position of club president following his tenure as coach with friend and teammate Clive Churchill coaching the bunnies through their last 'Golden Era' during 1967–1971.\nRepresentative career.\nDonoghue's representative career was plagued by injury. He represented New South Wales on ten occasions between 1950 and 1954. He also played in the winning 1951 City side that defeated Country, receiving man of the match honours.\nDonoghue was selected to represent Sydney against France during their 1951 tour of Australasia in a match that ended in a 19-all draw.\nDonoghue was also part of the now infamous 1954 match between NSW and England at the Sydney Cricket Ground where referee Aub Oxford turned his back and walked off as almost all players stopped playing the game and commenced street brawling. To this day it remains the only top level game ever abandoned in rugby league history.\nSelected for the Test against NZ in 1950, he was subsequently ruled out of the match due to injury. He debuted for Australia in 1951 against the touring French side, and was selected for the Kangaroo Tour in 1952. He broke his leg on the ship there and missed all six Test matches. Devastated, he immediately stood down from Test representative duties following it and refused to make himself available for selection He is listed on the \"Australian Players Register\" as Kangaroo No. 283.\nPost Retirement.\nOne year after retiring as a player, Denis Donoghue became coach of South Sydney Rabbitohs in 1959 and stayed in that position until the end of the 1963 season. He recruited and/or developed many of the early playing careers of future stars such as John Sattler\nHe then became president of the South Sydney club in 1966 and stayed in the position through their third 'Golden Era' until the early 1970s. Under Donoghue's colorful presidency the bunnies won four out of five premierships in 1967–1971.\nDenis Reginald Donoghue later owned racehorses and died on 5 December 1993 at Randwick, New South Wales, aged 67. He was cremated at Eastern Suburbs Memorial Park on 8 December 1993.\nIn 2007 he was named at 'prop' by a panel of experts for an Australian Team of the '50s."

The Final Four were Texas, Tennessee, Louisiana Tech, and Long Beach State, with Tennessee winning its first title with a 67-44 victory over Louisiana Tech. Tennessee's Tonya Edwards was named the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament.\nNotable events.\nUpsets were not unknown in the NCAA tournaments. For example, in the prior year, two 4 seeds made it to the Final Four. However, in the first five NCAA tournaments, once a team reached the Final Four, no team had beaten a higher seeded team. That changed in 1987.\nOne semifinal game matched defending National Champion Texas against Louisiana Tech. Although both teams were 1 seeds, the Texas team came into the tournament with only a single regular season loss, earning them the number one ranking in the country. In addition, the Final Four was played on the home court of the Longhorns. Despite that, and a crowd of over 15 thousand, the largest crowd in the history of the sport, the Louisiana Tech team managed to beat the Texas team 79–75. The Lady Techsters hit 58.3% of their field goals, the fourth best performance in NCAA Final Four history, and a blistering 73.9% in the second half, missing only six of the 23 shots taken in the second half. Texas tried to wear down Teresa Weatherspoon, but set an NCAA Final Four record with eleven assists, while putting in 19 points of her own.\nThe other semifinal game matched 2 seed Tennessee against 1 seed Long Beach State. Although Long Beach was averaging over 96 points per game, and had scored 102 in the West Regional final against Ohio State, the Lady Vols held the team to 64 points, and upset the 1 seed by a score of 74–64.\nThe lone loss by Texas in the regular season had been to Tennessee, ending the Longhorns 40 game win streak, but the two teams played again two weeks later, and this time Texas emerged victorious, with a 14-point victory. Tennessee earned the number one ranking in the AP vote after the win over Texas, but they began to stumble after the loss to Texas, with losses to Auburn, Mississippi and Vanderbilt. They played Louisiana Tech in February, and the lady Techsters won by nine points, dropping the Lady Vols to ninth in the poll. The Tennessee team earned a 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament, but after their upset win against Long Beach, they faced the Louisiana Tech team again, a team that had beaten the Volunteers in 11 of the last 12 meetings. One of those meetings had been the 1982 National Championship game, when the Lady Techsters beat the Volunteers by 23 points. The 1987 Championship would turn that result on its head, as Tennessee won by 23 points, upsetting Louisiana Tech 67–44, for their first National Championship.\nRecords.\nTeresa Weatherspoon recorded 11 assists in the National Semifinal game, the most scored in a Final Four game since they started keeping records of this statistic in 1985.\nQualifying teams – automatic.\nForty teams were selected to participate in the 1987 NCAA Tournament. Eighteen conferences were eligible for an automatic bid to the 1987 NCAA tournament.\nQualifying teams – at-large.\nTwenty-two additional teams were selected to complete the forty invitations.\nBids by conference.\nNineteen conferences earned an automatic bid. In eleven cases, the automatic bid was the only representative from the conference. Nineteen at-large teams were selected from eight of the conferences. In addition, two independent (not associated with an athletic conference) teams earned at-large bids.\nFirst and second rounds.\nIn 1987, the field remained at 40 teams. The teams were seeded, and assigned to four geographic regions, with seeds 1-10 in each region. In Round 1, seeds 8 and 9 faced each other for the opportunity to face the 1 seed in the second round, while seeds 7 and 10 faced each other for the opportunity to face the 2 seed.\nIn the first two rounds, the higher seed was given the opportunity to host the first round game. In most cases, the higher seed accepted the opportunity. The exceptions:\nBecause Oregon hosted both a first and second round game, there were only 23 first and second round locations, rather than 24.\nThe following table lists the region, host school, venue and the twenty-four first round locations:\nRegionals and Final Four.\nThe regionals, named for the general location, were held from March 20 to March 23 at these sites:\nBids by state.\nThe forty teams came from twenty states.\nLouisiana and Tennessee had the most teams with four each. Thirty states did not have any teams receiving bids.\nBrackets.\nFirst and second round games played at higher seed except where noted.\nRecord by conference.\nFifteen conferences had more than one bid, or at least one win in NCAA Tournament play:\nSix conferences went 0-1: Big East, Gulf Star Conference, High Country, MAAC, MAC, and Mountain West"

        "text": "Donald Thomas Kelly (born February 15, 1980) is an American professional baseball utility player and coach. He is the bench coach for the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played in MLB for the Pirates, Detroit Tigers, and Miami Marlins. Kelly played every position on the field in the major leagues, including pitcher. Over the course of his career, he mainly played the outfield and third base.\nEarly life and education.\nKelly was born in the Pittsburgh suburb of Butler, Pennsylvania and played baseball at suburban Mt. Lebanon High School; in his senior year the team won the Class AAA state title. At Mount Lebanon, he regularly alternated between the two middle infield positions with Josh Wilson, another future Major League player. \nHe was not then considered a \"draftable\" player and attended Point Park College, a liberal arts college in downtown Pittsburgh. Over three seasons he batted .413 and struck out just 20 times in over 500 at-bats. \nCareer.\nIn the summer of 2000 Kelly played for the Petersburg Generals of the Coastal Plain League, a collegiate summer league. Kelly's collegiate performance prompted interest from major league teams and the Detroit Tigers drafted him in the eighth round (237th overall) of the 2001 Major League Baseball draft. Detroit assigned him to the Low-A Oneonta Tigers in the New York–Penn League, where he batted .286 and struck out sixteen times—second lowest in the league. The next year Detroit promoted him to the Single-A West Michigan Whitecaps in the Midwest League. Kelly was named the starting shortstop for the Eastern All-Stars in the league's mid-season All-Star game.\nKelly's versatility was first put to the test at the professional level when he was with the High-A Lakeland Tigers in 2003. He shifted to third base when Anderson Hernández replaced him at shortstop. Kelly eventually spent more time at first and second base after Ryan Raburn took over at third. Kelly got off to a strong start: by mid-June his .363 average led the Florida State League and the local \"Ledger\" described him as a \"slugger.\" Although his average eventually cooled to .317, Detroit promoted him in mid-season to the Double-A Erie SeaWolves, where he joined future brother-in-law Matt Walker (brother of current Major League infielder Neil Walker).\nIn 2004 Detroit invited Kelly to spring training, and in his first at-bat in a spring training game Kelly hit a home run against the Pittsburgh Pirates. On March 17, Detroit optioned Kelly back to Erie, but he missed most of the season with an injured shoulder. Kelly returned to Erie in 2005 and picked up where he had left off, hitting .340 over 82 games. \"Baseball America\" named Kelly the best-hitting prospect in the Eastern League. On June 30, Detroit promoted him to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens of the International League, one step away from the majors.\nKelly played in 43 games for the Mud Hens in 2005 and batted .250, a tenure partially interrupted by a groin injury. Commented Mud Hens manager Larry Parrish: \"Hitting-wise, there's been a little bit of an adjustment for him here...He tore up Double-A, and here he's done alright. He's holding his own. But it's his first year here, and he's still going through a learning process.\" In the off-season Kelly played for the Mesa Solar Sox of the Arizona Fall League. In 2006 Kelly almost made the Major League team out of spring training but instead returned to Toledo. Detroit manager Jim Leyland said \"When push came to shove, he ran into a numbers game.\" At Toledo Kelly's numbers fell off; Detroit demoted him to Erie after hitting .228. At Erie his numbers improved to .272, but at the end of the season Detroit removed Kelly from their 40-man roster, making him a free agent.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates, Kelly's hometown team, signed him to a minor league contract on December 14, 2006. He made the Major League team as a utility player, filling in at second base, shortstop, and left and right field. His major league debut came on April 2, 2007 in a season-opening 4–2 victory over the Houston Astros at Minute Maid Park. As a pinch hitter for Dámaso Marte, Kelly popped out to the shortstop to end the Pirates half of the ninth inning. He finished the game at second base.\nKelly played sparingly, amassing 27 at-bats over 25 games and hitting .148, before Pittsburgh designated him for assignment on June 12 to make room for Dan Kolb. Kelly cleared waivers and joined the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians on June 23. Kelly finished out the season with Indianapolis, batting .247 and playing both shortstop and in the outfield. Pittsburgh granted Kelly free agency at the end of the season.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nKelly signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks and spent the entire 2008 season with the Triple-A Tucson Sidewinders, where he batted .275 but never made it with the major league club and was granted free agency at the end of the season.\nDetroit Tigers.\nIn 2009, Kelly signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Tigers. Following spring training Kelly rejoined the Mud Hens, with whom he had last played in 2006. On June 11, 2009, the Tigers called Kelly up to the Major League club to replace outfielder Clete Thomas. Kelly played his first game for Detroit against the Pittsburgh Pirates, his former club. After going hitless in his first game, he hit a two-RBI single and a double against Pittsburgh, obtaining his first major league extra base hit and RBIs.\nOn October 1, 2010, Kelly hit a home run in both games of a doubleheader against the Baltimore Orioles.\nOn July 24, 2011, Kelly was pranked by Justin Verlander after noticing that his right shoe was caught on fire.\nIn his first two seasons with the Tigers, Kelly added first and third base and center field to the positions he has played in the majors. He was called on to pitch with two outs in the top of the ninth inning after manager Jim Leyland thoroughly depleted his bullpen in a 16–9 defeat to the New York Mets at Comerica Park on June 29, 2011. Throwing only five pitches, he used a curveball to get Scott Hairston to fly out to center field. Kelly was the first position player to pitch in a game for the Tigers since Shane Halter did it in October 2000. He reached the milestone of having played every position on the field in his major league career in a 15–3 loss at home to the San Francisco Giants three nights later on July 2. He entered the contest at the start of the fourth inning, replacing starting catcher Víctor Martínez who had left the game with a bruised right shoulder.\nIn the decisive Game 5 of the 2011 American League Division Series against the New York Yankees, Kelly belted a first-inning solo home run off Iván Nova into the right field seats at Yankee Stadium to give the Tigers a 1–0 lead, one which they never relinquished. Detroit went on to win the game, 3–2, and moved on to face the Texas Rangers in the American League Championship Series.\nOn August 3, 2012, Kelly was designated for assignment to make room on the 40-man roster for outfielder Andy Dirks, who returned to the Tigers after coming off the disabled list the same day. On August 9, 2012, Kelly cleared waivers and his contract was outrighted by Detroit to their Triple-A affiliate Toledo. The Tigers called him up again on September 1, and later named him to their post-season roster after the team clinched the AL Central division. He hit a walk-off sacrifice fly in Game 2 of Detroit's American League Division Series against the Oakland Athletics.\nOn October 31, 2012, Don Kelly cleared waivers and became a free agent. On January 16, 2013, Kelly signed a minor league deal with the Tigers. He made the team out of spring training, and played another full season as the club's super-utility man. In 216 at-bats, Don hit .222 with six home runs and 23 RBIs, while playing six defensive positions. After the season, Kelly signed a one-year deal with Detroit that would pay him $1 million in 2014, avoiding arbitration. On November 3, 2014, Kelly declined his minor league assignment and became a free agent.\nMiami Marlins.\nOn January 18, 2015, Kelly signed a minor league contract with the Miami Marlins.\nAfter hitting .270 with two doubles and five RBI with .681 OPS in Spring training, the Marlins purchased Kelly's contract and placed him on the Opening Roster.\nKelly suffered a fractured finger early in the 2015 season and was placed on the 15-day disabled list on April 13. Kelly had two at-bats before getting hurt and was 0-for-2.\nOn July 18, 2015, the Marlins announced that Kelly would have season-ending Tommy John surgery.\nOn February 3, 2016, Kelly re-signed with the Marlins to a minor league deal with an invitation to spring training. He was released by the Marlins on March 29 and re-signed the next day. Kelly was called up from New Orleans on July 6.\nWith the return of Dee Gordon to the Marlins roster after an 80-day suspension for PED use, Kelly was designated for assignment on July 28, 2016.\nPost playing career.\nIn February 2017, Kelly was named a scout and assistant on the player development staff for the Detroit Tigers organization. On September 29, 2017, Kelly was promoted to a Major League scout for the Tigers. On November 21, 2018, Kelly was named the Houston Astros first base coach. Kelly was named the Pittsburgh Pirates bench coach on December 7, 2019.\nPersonal life.\nKelly spends his offseasons in Mars, PA, with his wife, Carrie, and their three sons, Brett, Luke and Brooks. He married Carrie Walker on January 13, 2007; his brothers-in-law include former major league infielder Neil Walker and former minor leaguer Matt Walker; his father-in-law is former major league pitcher Tom Walker. His wife Carrie was a women’s basketball player at Wagner College and the Northeast Conference Rookie of the Year in 2001. She went on to play a year of professional basketball for Killarney (St. Paul’s) of the Irish Women’s SuperLeague. His sister Ashlee was a standout women's basketball player for Quinnipiac University and the Northeast Conference Player of the Year in 2003. After spending three years as head women's basketball coach at Mercy College, she was named assistant coach at Iona College on July 1, 2009."

        "title": "Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball",
        "text": "The Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball team represents Iowa State University (ISU) and competes in the Big 12 Conference of NCAA Division I. The Cyclones play their home games at Hilton Coliseum on Iowa State's campus.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1908–1980).\nFrom 1907 to 1928, the Cyclones played in the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association, managing a few winning records in-conference but no championships. In 1929, the Cyclones moved to the Big Six Conference and named Louis Menze as head coach. Over the next 19 years, Menze would lead the Cyclones to four conference championships (their only seasons with a winning conference record in this period). Two of these teams earned consideration for the then eight-team NCAA tournament; the 1941 squad lost in a pre-Tournament \"qualifying game\" to Creighton. Three years later, the 1944 team beat Pepperdine to reach the semifinals in the tournament proper before losing its next game against eventual champion Utah, good for a spot in history as a Final Four participant.\nAfter Menze's last conference win in 1945 and subsequent resignation as coach in 1947 (he would remain Iowa State's athletic director until 1958, having taken the position in 1945), the Cyclones floated between the bottom and the middle of the conference for decades, their main claim to fame being two wins of the conference's annual \"Holiday tournament\", played between Christmas and New Year's Day in Kansas City, in 1955 and 1959. Neither these tournament wins, nor their regular season performances, qualified the Cyclones for postseason play in the 33 years between Menze's and Johnny Orr's stints in the head coaching position. However, the 1957 Cyclones were ranked #3 in the nation after handing Wilt Chamberlain's #1 Kansas its first loss.\nGary Thompson outscored Chamberlain, while Don Medsker held Chamberlain to 17 points the 2nd lowest of his career and then hit the game winner at the buzzer. From the introduction of the Big Eight's postseason tournament in 1977 until Johnny Orr's fifth season in 1985, the Cyclones did not advance past their first game.\nIn 1971, Maury John left Drake University to move to Iowa State. John led Drake to the 1969 NCAA Final Four and the Elite Eight in 1970 NCAA tournament and 1971 NCAA tournament. John inherited an Iowa State team that was 5–21 the previous season. John was excited about the new Hilton Coliseum and led Iowa State to a 12–14 record in 1971–1972 and a 16–10 record in 1972–1973, a 15-year best. On Dec. 2, 1971, in the first game played at Hilton Coliseum, John led the Cyclones to a victory over Arizona 71–54. Said Cyclone announcer Eric Heft, a player for Coach John: \"The place was sold out for the Arizona game and we doubled the capacity of season tickets from the season before. We didn't have all the fanfare you have today, but it was packed. It was my first game and Maury John's first game as the head Cyclone coach as well.\"\nIn the 1973–74 season, Iowa State was off to a 4–1 start. But, John sat out the remainder of the 1973–74 season after a cancer diagnosis. Assistant Gus Guydon (11–10) finished the season. In October 1973, John had seen a doctor after having health concerns. Two months later, on the day his Iowa State team lost at Drake, John was told he had an inoperable malignant tumor at the base of his esophagus. \"It was a bolt out of the blue for someone who lived his life free of smoking or drinking,\" His son John said later. \"There was high stress. But he was always healthy.\"\nJohn was optimistic about returning to Iowa State in 1974–75, but his health worsened and he resigned on July 30, 1974. John said \"It's going to be hard for me not to be on that bench. I won't have to sweat out all those games down on the floor. But truthfully, I'd rather be down there sweating them out.\" John died on October 15, 1974, at the age of 55. During a 28‐year coaching career, John had a 528–214 record. John's departure sent the Cyclones into free fall. In the next six years, Iowa State would only have one winning season, bottoming out in 1975–76 with a 3–24 record, still the worst in school history.\nJohnny Orr era (1980–1994).\nJohnny Orr came to Iowa State from Michigan in 1980. Iowa State's athletics director had called Orr to inquire about Michigan assistant Bill Frieder. When Orr learned of the salary Iowa State would offer Frieder, he negotiated the Iowa State head coaching job for himself. Orr is credited with building \"Hilton Magic\" and laying the foundation for Iowa State's success in men's basketball. A number of Cyclone greats played for Orr, including Jeff Grayer, Barry Stevens, walk-on Jeff Hornacek, Lafester Rhodes, Justus Thigpen, Victor Alexander, Fred Hoiberg, Julius Michalik, and Loren Meyer, many of whom would go on to success in the NBA.\nOrr's first team (1980–81), led by junior forward Robert Estes (14.9 points per game, 6.7 rebounds per game) produced a lackluster 9–18 record. Freshman forward Ron Harris, whom Orr considered his first prominent Cyclone recruit, contributed per-game averages of 13.7 points and 5.9 rebounds.\nLed by sophomore Ron Harris and freshman recruit Barry Stevens of Flint, Michigan, Orr's 1981–82 team finished the season with a 10–17 overall record and a 5–9 record in Big Eight play. Harris gave the Cyclones 13.3 points per game, while Stevens contributed 13.0 points per game. Senior Robert Estes added 10.3 points per game.\nThe Cyclones improved to a 13–15 overall record in the 1982–83 season, but again finished 5–9 in conference play. Many of the Cyclone faithful regard sophomore Barry Stevens' buzzer-beating shot against 10th-ranked Missouri during the 1982–83 season as the foundational example of \"Hilton Magic.\" Stevens tallied per-game averages of 16.8 points and 5.2 rebounds for the season. Ron Harris contributed 14.3 points per game.\nOrr's 1983–84 team recorded the first winning season of his tenure at Iowa State—and the first winning season for Cyclone basketball since Lynn Nance's 1977–78 team finished 14–13—with a 16–13 overall mark and a 6–8 record in conference play. The Cyclones played in the 1984 National Invitation Tournament (NIT), losing to Marquette in the first round. Junior forward Barry Stevens averaged 22.2 points per game on the season. Seniors Terrence Allen and Ron Harris each averaged 11.0 points per game.\nLed by senior Barry Stevens and freshman forward Jeff Grayer, natives of Flint, Michigan known at Iowa State as \"The Flintstones\", the 1984–85 Cyclones finished tied for third in conference play (7–7) and finished 21–13 overall. Iowa State advanced to the NCAA tournament for the first time under Orr and for just the second time in the history of the program. The Cyclones, the #13 seed in the Midwest Region, lost to #4 seed Ohio State by a score of 75–64. ISU managed to upset 10th-ranked Kansas twice during the regular season. Stevens averaged 21.7 points per game. Junior guard Jeff Hornacek recorded 12.5 points per game, and Grayer averaged 12.2 points and 6.5 rebounds on the season.\nDespite the departure of two-time first-team All-Big Eight forward Stevens, the 1985–86 campaign saw First-team All-Big Eight players Grayer and Hornacek lead the Cyclones to their most successful season yet under Orr. Iowa State finished with a 22–11 overall mark and a 9–5 record and second-place finish in conference play. The Cyclones advanced to the NCAA tournament in consecutive years for the first time in school history. With wins over #10 seed Miami (Ohio) and #2 seed Michigan, the #7 seed Cyclones reached the \"Sweet Sixteen\" before falling to #6 seed North Carolina State, 70–66. Grayer led the Cyclones with per-game averages of 20.7 points and 6.3 rebounds. Hornacek averaged 13.7 points per game. The Cyclones upset 5th-ranked Oklahoma and 4th-ranked Kansas during the regular season.\nThe 1986–87 Cyclones finished with a 13–15 overall record and a 5–9 record in Big Eight play, missing postseason tournament competition for the first time in four seasons. Grayer (now a junior) averaged 22 points and 7 rebounds per game, while senior Tom Schafer averaged 18 points and 6 rebounds. Despite their struggles, the 1986–87 Cyclones managed wins over two ranked teams (15th-ranked Kansas and 12th-ranked Oklahoma).\nOrr's 1987–88 Cyclones rebounded from the losing season of the prior year to finish 20–12 overall and 6–8 in conference play, including wins over #2 Purdue, #7 Iowa, #16 Kansas, and #15 Missouri. Iowa State returned to the NCAA tournament, losing 90–78 to #5 seed Georgia Tech in the first round. The Cyclones were led by senior and three-time first-team All-Big Eight forward Jeff Grayer and senior Lafester Rhodes, who averaged 25 and 22 points per game, respectively.\nThe 1988–89 Cyclones finished the season 17–12 overall and 7–7 in conference play, including a victory over third-ranked Missouri in Hilton Coliseum. The Cyclones advanced to their fourth NCAA tournament under Orr, losing 84–74 to #7 seed UCLA in the first round. Sophomore Victor Alexander averaged 20 points and 9 rebounds per game on the season. Sophomore Mark Baugh averaged 13.3 points per game, while Sam Mack contributed per-game averages of 11.8 points and 8.1 rebounds.\nFollowing the loss of key players to attrition and legal problems in the offseason, the 1989–90 Cyclones finished 10–18 overall and 4–10 in conference play, marking the Cyclones' second-worst season under Orr. Only Orr's 1980–81 team, his first at ISU, had finished with a worse overall record. Junior Victor Alexander averaged 19.7 points and 8.7 rebounds per game. Senior guard Terry Woods averaged 16 points per game.\nThe 1990–91 season saw the Cyclones finish with an overall record of 12–19 and a conference record of 6–8. Despite their poor overall performance, the Cyclones managed wins over two ranked teams (#12 Oklahoma State and #21 Oklahoma). Senior Victor Alexander averaged 23.4 points per game and 9.0 rebounds per game, while senior Doug Collins averaged 14.3 points per game.\nIowa State's fortunes improved during the 1991–92 season, with the Cyclones finishing 21–13 overall (5–9 in conference play) and earning the #10 seed in the East Region of the NCAA tournament. The Cyclones defeated #7 seed UNC Charlotte in the opening round before losing 106–98 to #2 seed Kentucky in the round of 32. Iowa State recorded wins over #16 Iowa, #21 Oklahoma, #2 Oklahoma State, #3 Kansas, and #13 Missouri during the regular season. Junior Justus Thigpen led the team with 16.3 points per game, while junior Ron Bayless averaged 12.6 points per game. Freshmen Julius Michalik and Fred Hoiberg averaged 13.6 and 12.1 points per game, respectively.\nIowa State finished the 1992–93 season with a 20–11 overall record and a second-place 8–6 record in conference play. The Cyclones advanced to their sixth and final NCAA tournament under head coach Johnny Orr, losing in the first round to #9 seed UCLA, 81–70. Iowa State managed victories over #12 Oklahoma and #7 Kansas during the regular season. Seniors Justus Thigpen and Ron Bayless led the team with 17.6 points and 13.3 points per game, respectively. Sophomore Julius Michalik and Ames native and sophomore Fred Hoiberg contributed 12.0 and 11.6 points per game, respectively.\nIn the 1993–94 campaign—Orr's final season as Iowa State men's basketball head coach—the Cyclones posted a 14–13 overall mark and a 4–10 record in conference play. ISU was led by a trio of juniors—Loren Meyer, Fred Hoiberg, and Julius Michalik, each of whom averaged over 20 points per game on the season.\nOrr retired from coaching in 1994. He remains the winningest coach in Iowa State history (in terms of total wins), with a win–loss record of 218–200 as the head coach of the Cyclones.\nTim Floyd era (1994–1998).\nFollowing Johnny Orr's retirement, Iowa State hired Tim Floyd from the University of New Orleans to become the next men's basketball head coach. Floyd's first ISU team recorded a 23–11 overall mark and a 6–8 mark in conference play, and advanced to the second round of the 1995 NCAA tournament by beating Florida, 64–61, before losing 73–51 to #2 seed North Carolina. Senior Fred Hoiberg averaged 19.9 points per game. Seniors Loren Meyer and Julius Michalik averaged 15.7 points and 9.0 rebounds per game and 14.3 points and 5.4 rebounds per game, respectively.\nFollowing the graduation of four starters from the 1994–95 Cyclones, Tim Floyd replenished his roster with several junior college and Division I transfers. Four of the 1995–96 team's starters had not been part of the ISU roster during the prior season, with sophomore point guard Jacy Holloway being the lone exception. Dedric Willoughby transferred to Iowa State from the University of New Orleans, and Kenny Pratt, Shawn Bankhead, and Kelvin Cato each transferred from junior colleges to play for the Cyclones. The 1995–96 Cyclones finished with a 24–9 overall record, a second-place 9–5 conference record, and the final Big Eight tournament championship—the first conference tournament championship in Cyclone basketball history—with a 56–55 victory over Roy Williams' Kansas Jayhawks. Iowa State earned the #5 seed in the Midwest Region of the NCAA tournament, the then-highest seed achieved in ISU men's basketball history. The Cyclones defeated #12 seed California 74–64 in the first round of the Tournament; Rick Majerus' #4 seed Utah Utes defeated ISU 73–67 in the second round. Dedric Willoughby averaged 20.5 points per game on the season. Kenny Pratt averaged 15.3 points and 6.5 rebounds per game, while Kelvin Cato contributed per-game averages of 9.6 points and 7.7 rebounds.\nThe 1996–97 Cyclones returned all five starters from the previous season's Big Eight tournament championship and NCAA Tournament team. Iowa State finished with a 22–9 overall record and a 10–6 conference mark in the inaugural season of the expanded Big 12 Conference. The Cyclones would advance to the third NCAA tournament Sweet Sixteen in Iowa State men's basketball history with victories over Illinois State and Cincinnati, before falling in a 74–73 overtime loss to UCLA. Senior Dedric Willoughby averaged 18.9 points per game for the season, and seniors Kenny Pratt and Kelvin Cato averaged 14.7 points and 6.1 rebounds per game and 11.3 points and 8.4 rebounds per game, respectively.\nTim Floyd's 1997–98 Cyclones finished the season with a 12–18 overall record and a 5–11 conference record. Freshman forward Marcus Fizer averaged 14.9 points and 6.7 rebounds per game, and Klay Edwards contributed per-game averages of 9.3 points and 7.7 rebounds. Following the season, Floyd left Iowa State to replace Phil Jackson as the head coach of the Chicago Bulls.\nLarry Eustachy era (1998–2003).\nIowa State hired Larry Eustachy from Utah State to fill the head coaching position vacated by Tim Floyd. In his first season, Eustachy led the Cyclones to 15–15 overall record and a 6–10 record in Big 12 play. Sophomore Marcus Fizer averaged 18 points and 7.6 rebounds per game. Michael Nurse and Martin Rancik both averaged 10.3 points per game.\nFollowing his first season, Eustachy gained the services of two guards, Jamaal Tinsley and Kantrail Horton, via transfer. The 1999–2000 Cyclones returned Marcus Fizer, Martin Rancik, Michael Nurse, and Stevie Johnson from the previous season's team. Iowa State finished the season 32–5 overall, setting a school record for wins in a season. The Cyclones finished 14–2 in conference play to earn the outright Big 12 Conference regular season championship—the sixth regular season conference title in the program's history, and the first since 1945. The Cyclones then defeated Oklahoma 70–58 in the Big 12 basketball tournament finals to win the Big 12 conference tournament championship, the second conference tournament title in ISU men's basketball history. The #2 seed Cyclones advanced to the Elite Eight of the 2000 NCAA tournament after wins over #15 seed Central Connecticut State, #7 seed Auburn, and #6 seed UCLA by 10, 19, and 24 points, respectively, but ultimately fell to Michigan State, the eventual NCAA Champion, in the regional finals by a score of 75–64 (the differential representing the Spartans' narrowest margin of victory during the tournament). It was the Cyclones' deepest NCAA Tournament run in the modern era. The Big 12 champion Cyclones were led in scoring by All-American forward and eventual fourth pick of the 2000 NBA draft Marcus Fizer, who averaged 22.8 points per game and 7.7 rebounds per game. Michael Nurse and first team All-Big 12 guard Jamaal Tinsley contributed 12.5 points and 11 points per game, respectively.\nDespite the departure of Marcus Fizer to the NBA, Eustachy's 2000–01 Cyclones, led by returning senior and eventual All-American guard Jamaal Tinsley and senior Kantrail Horton, managed a 25–6 overall record and a 13–3 record in conference play, earning a second consecutive Big 12 regular season championship. Iowa State earned a #2 seed in the NCAA tournament, but the Cyclones' season ended with a stunning 58–57 defeat at the hands of #15 seed Hampton. Iowa State became just the fourth #2 seed to lose to a #15 seed since the expansion of the Tournament field to 64 teams in 1985. Jamaal Tinsley led the team in scoring with 14.3 points per game. Martin Rancik and freshman Jake Sullivan added 13.2 points per game and 11.4 points per game, respectively.\nThe 2001–02 Cyclones produced the worst overall men's basketball record since the 1990–91 season, finishing 12–19 overall record and 4–12 in conference play. Tyray Pearson averaged 18.7 points and 7.8 rebounds per game. Jake Sullivan and Shane Power contributed per-game averages of 16 points and 13.6 points, respectively.\nThe 2002–03 Cyclones finished with a 17–14 overall record and a 5–11 conference record. ISU accepted an invitation to the NIT. The Cyclones defeated Wichita State in the opening (play-in) round, but fell 54–53 to Iowa in the first round. Jake Sullivan led the team in scoring with 17 points per game. Jackson Vroman contributed 12.5 points and 9.4 rebounds per game. Junior point guard Tim Barnes averaged 11.3 points per game.\nFollowing the 2002–03 season, pictures surfaced showing Larry Eustachy at a student party in Columbia, Missouri. Eustachy attended the party just hours after his team had lost to Missouri. Though Eustachy broke no laws, he did violate a conduct clause in his contract, which led to Eustachy's public admission of alcoholism. Eustachy subsequently resigned on May 5, 2003, receiving a $960,000 settlement from Iowa State.\nWayne Morgan &amp; Greg McDermott era (2003–2010).\nIn 2004 Iowa State reached the NIT semifinals under Wayne Morgan with wins over Georgia, Florida State, and Marquette, before falling to Rutgers. In 2005 Iowa State reached the NCAA Tournament and defeated the University of Minnesota in a 1st-round game, losing to eventual national champion the University of North Carolina. Both teams were led by Curtis Stinson and NBA Draft pick Will Blalock. Morgan's won-lost record from 2003 to 2006 was 55–39.\nMorgan was replaced by Greg McDermott, who previously coached at Northern Iowa. During McDermott's tenure, he recruited Craig Brackins, Michael Taylor, Justin Hamilton, Diante Garrett and Wes Johnson, all of whom would eventually play in the NBA. In 2010, McDermott resigned to accept the head coaching position at Creighton. From 2006 to 2010 Greg McDermott recorded a won lost record of 59–68 with no NCAA appearances. He was replaced by Fred Hoiberg.\nFred Hoiberg era (2010–2015).\nOn April 27, 2010, it was announced that Fred Hoiberg, a star at Iowa State in the early and mid-1990s, would become the 19th coach in the history of the Iowa State men's basketball program. In his first season as coach, Hoiberg led a team with only four returning players to a 16–16 record.\nIn his second season, Iowa State had a much deeper team with players such as Royce White, Chris Babb, and others now eligible to play after sitting out the previous year due to transfer rules. The Cyclones improved to 23-11, had 12 wins in the conference, and earned a #8 seed in the South Regional in the 2012 NCAA tournament, earning Hoiberg Big 12 Co-Coach of the Year honors. The Cyclones defeated the #9 seed and defending national champion Connecticut Huskies before falling to overall #1 seed and eventual champion Kentucky.\nIn Hoiberg's third season, the Cyclones earned a #10 seed and defeated #7 Notre Dame to advance to the Round of 32. It was the first year the Cyclones had been to the NCAA Tournament in back-to-back years since 2000–2001, and the first time the Cyclones had won Tournament games in successive seasons since 1996–1997.\nHoiberg entered his fourth season at Iowa State by guiding the team to its best start to a season with a 14–0 undefeated non-conference record before suffering its first loss to Big 12 rival Oklahoma, 87–82, on January 11, 2014, in Norman. The winning streak included victories over #7 Michigan and #23 Iowa, plus wins over George Mason, Akron, and Boise State to capture the Diamond Head Classic in Honolulu, Hawaii. The Cyclones entered the Big 12 men's basketball tournament with a 23–7 mark. After a close call with Kansas State in the quarterfinals, Iowa State faced Kansas in the semifinals, the only team it had not beaten at least once all year to that point. ISU emerged victorious this time, beating the Jayhawks, 94–83. Iowa State went on to beat Baylor in the Big 12 championship game, 74–65, for its first conference tournament title since 2000.\nThe Cyclones earned a #3 seed in the East Regional of the 2014 NCAA tournament and defeated their first opponent, North Carolina Central, 93–75. Another close call came next in the third-round game against North Carolina, with ISU prevailing, 85–83. The Cyclones advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time since 2000, and lost to #7 seed Connecticut, 81–76 (the differential representing the Huskies' narrowest margin of victory during the tournament), the eventual national champion. This marked the third time in their last four trips to the NCAA Tournament that the Cyclones lost to the eventual national champions (2005 North Carolina, 2012 Kentucky, and 2014 Connecticut.)\nIn 2014–15, Hoiberg's Cyclones finished the season with a 25–9 overall record and 12–6 in the Big 12, finishing second to Kansas in the conference regular season. ISU defeated Texas, 69–67, Oklahoma, 67–65, and Kansas, 70–66, in the championship to win its second straight Big 12 Conference tournament championship. Invited to the NCAA Tournament for the fourth consecutive year, the #3 seed Cyclones were upset by #14 seed UAB, 60–59, in the first round. The Cyclones finished the season ranked ninth in the final AP poll. After several weeks of speculation, Fred Hoiberg was hired on June 2, 2015, by the NBA's Chicago Bulls to be their head coach.\nSteve Prohm era (2015–2021).\nOn June 8, 2015, Iowa State announced that Steve Prohm, previously the head coach at Murray State for four seasons, would become the 20th head coach of the Cyclones. After the departure of Fred Hoiberg, Prohm retained Assistant Coach T.J. Otzelberger and Assistant Coach Director of Basketball Operations Micah Byars on his staff, while making the additions of Assistant Coach William Small (formerly under Prohm as an assistant at Murray State), Assistant Coach Daniyal Robinson (formerly on staff at Loyola Chicago), and Special Assistant to the Head Coach Neill Berry, who was previously on staff at High Point and played for Prohm in college at Southeastern Louisiana. Prohm's first season was a success with a few bumps along the way. The Cyclones finished the regular season 10–8 in conference play and 21–10 overall; this included wins over No. 1 Oklahoma and No. 4 Kansas. The Cyclones then received a No. 4 seed in the NCAA tournament. After wins over Iona and Arkansas–Little Rock, they advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, where they lost to Virginia. After the conclusion of the season, Otzelberger accepted the head coaching job at South Dakota State, and Neill Berry was promoted to assistant coach.\nOn February 4, 2017, Iowa State won at No. 3 Kansas, ending the longest active home win streak in NCAA men's college basketball at 54 games. Iowa State became the first team to beat Bill Self more than once at Allen Fieldhouse. The Cyclones then proceeded to win their third conference tournament title in four years with wins over Oklahoma State, TCU and West Virginia. The Cyclones were selected as a five seed in NCAA tournament, where they proceeded to beat the University of Nevada in the tournament's second round. Iowa State then lost to 4-seed Purdue in the round of 32, 80–76.\nAfter a down 2017–2018 season, in 2018-2019 the Cyclones went 23–12 and 9–9 in the Big 12 conference. They faced Baylor in the first round of the Big 12 Tournament, winning 83–66. They next beat number 1 seed Kansas State, 63–59. They played Kansas in the Big 12 Championship and won 78–66. They were a 6 seed in the NCAA tournament, where they lost in the first round to Ohio State, an 11 seed. On March 26, Iowa State announced that Prohm's contract had been extended through 2025, while sophomore forward Cameron Lard requested a transfer from the school, citing the need for a fresh start.\nFollowing a disappointing 2-22 season (0-18 in the Big 12), on March 15, 2021, Prohm was fired as the head men's basketball coach.\nT.J. Otzelberger era (2021–present).\nOn March 18, 2021, former Iowa State assistant coach T. J. Otzelberger, who spent the last 2 seasons as head coach at UNLV, was named the 21st head coach of the program. As of March 7, 2022, the Cyclones are 20–12 in Otzelberger's first season with victories over Texas Tech, Texas, Memphis, and Iowa, suffering their first loss to #1 ranked Baylor on January 1, 2022.\nThe team began to slowly pick up under his leadership. In the 2022-2023 season, the Cyclones went 19-14 overall while going 9-9 in conference play, ending tied for 6th. They would advance to the semifinals in the Big 12 tournament, but would lose to Kansas 71-58. In the 2023 NCAA Tournament, they would be placed as a 6th seed, but were upset by No. 11 Pittsburgh in the first round.\nThe 2023-2024 season would be a turnaround. The Cyclones would initially go 11-2 in non-conference play, but end the season with an overall record of 27-7 and a conference record of 13-5 placing them in second of the Big 12. They would follow this up with winning the Big 12 Championship, defeating No. 9 Kansas State 76-57, No. 4 Baylor 76-62, and obliterating No. 1 Houston 69-41 in the largest blowout in the history of the Big 12 tournament. They would end ranked No. 4 on the AP Top 25 and with the best defense in the nation. In the NCAA Men's Tournament, they entered as a No. 2 seed and have defeated No. 15 South Dakota State Jackrabbits and moved on to the second round. There they defeated No. 7 Washington State to move on to the Sweet 16. In the Sweet 16 they fell to No.3 Illinois 72-69.\nAll-time records.\nRecord versus Iowa schools.\nRecords vs Iowa schools as of the end of February 9, 2024.\nPostseason tournament history.\nIowa State has appeared in the NCAA Tournament 23 times, with a current record of 23–23. \nNIT results.\nIowa State has appeared in the National Invitational Tournament three times. The Cyclones have a record of 4–3.\nPageantry and traditions.\nTeam name.\nThe original \"Cyclone\" football team first played during 1895. This team earned the nickname \"Cyclones\" when they soundly defeated Northwestern, 36–0. The \"Chicago Tribune\" the next day headlined the story about the game \"STRUCK BY A CYCLONE — It Comes From Iowa and Devastates Evanston Town.\" Since then the name Cyclones has been associated with Iowa State.\nMascot.\nBorrowing from one of its school colors, Iowa State uses a cardinal, Cy, as its mascot instead of an actual tornado or Cyclone. Prior to the football match-up against Colorado on November 12, 2005, a tornado touched down in several places in and around Ames, Iowa, forcing fans to either weather the storm outside in the parking lot or seek shelter in the adjacent Bergstrom Indoor Training Facility or nearby Hilton Coliseum. Such an atmosphere was created that Iowa State was able to beat the favored Buffaloes, 30–16. When asked about the event, Colorado coach Gary Barnett said, \"I thought we had a pretty good mascot. But when we showed up at Iowa State and they had a real tornado, that's the real deal.\"\nRivalries.\nIowa.\nWhile the Kansas Jayhawks are the Cyclone's main basketball rival, Iowa State's biggest non-conference rival is the Cyclone's in-state rival the Iowa Hawkeyes. This rivalry game counts toward the Iowa Corn Cy-Hawk Series that encompasses all athletic competitions between Iowa and Iowa State. The series began in 1909–10, but it was suspended between 1935 and 1970. As of the 2021–22 season, Iowa leads the all-time basketball series 47–28.\nHy-Vee Classic.\nIn the Hy-Vee Classic, which ran from 2012 to 2018, Iowa State played in-state rivals from the Missouri Valley Conference at Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines, on an alternating basis each December: Drake in even years and Northern Iowa in odd years.\nAs of the 2018–19 season, Iowa State has a 38–13 lead in the all-time series against Northern Iowa (going 2–1 in Hy-Vee Classic games). Also as of that season, Iowa State has a 110–65 all-time series lead over Drake (going 4–0 in Hy-Vee Classic games).\nFacilities.\nHilton Coliseum\nJames H. Hilton Coliseum is a 14,384-seat multi-purpose arena in Ames, Iowa. The arena, which is part of the Iowa State Center, opened in 1971. It is home to the Iowa State Cyclones basketball, wrestling, gymnastics, and volleyball teams. The building was specifically built to hold in sound with a solid concrete structure, steel doors, and a crowd that sits just a few feet from the court. During big games, players from opposing teams, as well as Iowa State, have even said that the floor has shaken due to the loudness of the crowd. A record basketball crowd of 15,000 saw the Cyclones post a 97–94 win over Iowa in 1971.\nHilton Magic is the atmosphere created by the fans at Hilton Coliseum during men's and women's basketball games. The now famous moniker for Iowa State's home basketball facility was coined by \"Des Moines Register\" writer Buck Turnbull on February 14, 1989, after the Cyclones (with Johnny Orr as coach) stunned third-ranked Missouri, 82–75. The morning newspaper included a headline that read \"Hilton Magic Spells 'Upset' One More Time.\" In the article, Turnbull called for more Hilton Magic in an upcoming game with Oklahoma State. Cyclone fans responded and ISU defeated the Cowboys, 90–81, and a nickname was born.\nAccording to many sources, Hilton Coliseum is considered one of the toughest venues to play in the nation.\nSukup Basketball Complex\nOpened in September 2009, Iowa State's new basketball practice facility is located on two acres of land (in west Ames) that was donated by a local developer, Dickson Jensen. The $8 million, facility, includes two separate 10,000-square-foot gymnasiums for both the men's and women's basketball programs, as well as separate lounges and locker rooms, a theater room, a medical treatment area, and coaches' offices and conference rooms.\nHixson-Lied Student Success Center\nThe $10 million Hixson-Lied Student Success Center was designed for improving academic achievement campus-wide, with the second floor devoted specifically to student athletes. The facility was built using private contributions. Since its completion in 2006, Iowa State student athletes have dramatically improved in the classroom and now have a higher average grade point average than the rest of the student body.\nNBA draft.\nAs of the conclusion of the 2020 NBA draft, 41 Cyclone players have been selected in the NBA draft in the history of the program. Of these, ten players were selected in the first round, and eleven were selected in the second round.\nIndividual accomplishments.\nRetired numbers.\nIowa State has retired seven numbers to date:"

        "title": "College lacrosse",
        "text": "College lacrosse is played by student-athletes at colleges and universities in the United States and Canada. In both countries, men's field lacrosse and women's lacrosse are played at both the varsity and club levels. College lacrosse in Canada is sponsored by the Canadian University Field Lacrosse Association (CUFLA) and Maritime University Field Lacrosse League (MUFLL), while in the United States, varsity men's and women's lacrosse is governed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) and National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). There are also university lacrosse programs in the United Kingdom sponsored by British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS) and programs in Japan.\nIn the U.S., as of the 2021–22 academic year, there were 74 NCAA-sanctioned Division I men's lacrosse teams, 75 Division II men's lacrosse teams, and 247 Division III men's lacrosse teams. There are 120 Division I women's lacrosse teams, 114 Division II women's lacrosse teams, and 291 Division III women's lacrosse teams. There were also 21 men's programs and 11 women's programs at two-year community colleges organized by the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) and a growing number of National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) four-year small college programs.\nAs of 2016–17, there were 184 collegiate men's club teams competing through the Men's Collegiate Lacrosse Association (MCLA), including most major universities in the United States without NCAA men's programs, organized into two divisions and ten conferences. Schools that feature an NCAA Division I FBS football team must play in Division 1, while most other teams compete in Division 2. There are 225 collegiate club teams for women organized by the Women's Collegiate Lacrosse Associates (WCLA).\nHistory of college lacrosse.\nThe first intercollegiate game in the United States was played on November 22, 1877 between New York University and Manhattan College. Lacrosse had been introduced in upstate New York in the 1860s. Lacrosse was further introduced to the Baltimore area in the 1890s. These two areas continue to be hotbeds of college lacrosse in the U.S. An organizing body for the sport, the U. S. National Amateur Lacrosse Association, was founded in 1879. The first intercollegiate lacrosse tournament was held in 1881, with Harvard beating Princeton, 3–0, in the championship game. New York University and Columbia University also participated. In 1882 three colleges formed a league called the Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (ILA), which four other colleges soon joined. From this point through 1931, collegiate lacrosse associations chose an annual champion based on season records. In 1894, the Inter-University Lacrosse League (IULL) began play using slightly different rules.\nThe two leagues merged in December 1905 to form the 8-team United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse League. The USILL was a closed-membership league, which excluded several lacrosse powers, such as the U.S. Naval Academy. The national championship was officially bestowed only upon teams that were included in the membership of these organizations. In 1912, the USILL established Northern and Southern Divisions and began conducting a post-season playoff. Harvard defeated Swarthmore, 7–3, in the first formal playoff. This system continued through 1925. As Navy was not a member of the USILL, its teams were not eligible for the championship, even though Navy had the best collegiate record in many of those years. Navy was undefeated from 1917 through 1923, a stretch of 40 games with one tie.\nThe USILL was replaced by the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association in March, 1926, as an open-membership governing body. Six more teams became new USILA members, in addition to the former USILL teams. The USILA bestowed gold medals upon the teams that it selected as national champions through the 1931 season. No official champions were named from 1932 through 1935. In 1936, an award was established in the memory of a Baltimore sportswriter to recognize annually the most outstanding teams. From 1936 through 1972, the USILA executive board awarded the Wingate Memorial Trophy to the national champions.\nFrom at least 1951, if not earlier, lacrosse divisions were officially named after legendary lacrosse-men. These were the Cy Miller, Laurie D. Cox, and Roy Taylor Divisions. They were more commonly referred to Division I, or A; Division II, or B; and Division III, or C. All college teams were placed in one of the three divisions, dependent upon their records, schedules, and success for the preceding five years, and a point system was created. Any team of the three divisions was eligible to win the national championship, but this was virtually impossible for non-Division I teams. A Division II team, playing several Division I teams, might have been able to achieve it. A team's record was required to include six games against teams in its own division. Teams were realigned every three years, again reflecting their records. All schools were eligible for the national rankings. The team that achieved the highest point total each year, however, was not guaranteed a solo national championship. The system served as guidance to the USILA executive board, who chose co-champions on frequent occasions. This point system prevailed with modifications until the NCAA in the early 1970s established the playoff system for determining champions.\nAt its 1969 annual meeting in Baltimore, the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association voted for its first playoff tournament to determine a national champion. In 1971, the NCAA began sponsoring men's lacrosse and began holding an annual championship tournament for Division I schools. The USILA conducted a small college tournament for non-Division I schools in 1972 and 1973. In 1974, the NCAA took over the sponsorship of this tournament through the 1979 season, with separate tournaments being conducted in both 1980 and 1981 for Divisions II and III teams. The Division II tournament then was discontinued until returning in 1993.\nMichael Brown, LSM/D, holds record for attending every NJCAA school besides for Onondaga CC.\nParticipation &amp; Growth.\nLacrosse is one of the fastest growing sports in America, at the collegiate level. Across both men’s and women’s collegiate athletic programs, lacrosse experienced greater growth in the number of teams than any other sport. The number of women’s lacrosse teams more than doubled between 2003 and 2023, rising from 256 to 541 teams. Men’s lacrosse experienced nearly a 70% increase during the same 20-year period, increasing from 236 to 398 teams. The growth across all three NCAA lacrosse Divisions has increased the scholarships available to students seeking to continue playing lacrosse at the collegiate level. As of 2017, the total college player population of both men and women increased from 253,931 in 2001 to 826,033 in 2016. The linear growth can be seen in the graph right side.\nLacrosse is one of the least diverse sports in America. In 2021, it was reported that ethnically white lacrosse players make up 72.8% of the total lacrosse population, followed by 8.9% Black or African American and 7.5% Latino or Hispanic players. At the collegiate level specifically, white women’s lacrosse players make up 84% of the population and 85% of men’s lacrosse players population. 7% of men’s lacrosse head coaches and 10% of women’s lacrosse head coaches are non-white ethnicities across all divisions.\nScholarships.\nAccording to NCAA, 51% of student athletes receive athletic aid in some capacity. The NCAA limits the number of scholarships that can be awarded to any athletic team. Not every team is fully-funded, and for teams that are not fully funded, even fewer scholarships can be awarded. The funding per team is not public information, so players must communicate with coaches about whether they are eligible and will be awarded an athletic scholarship Ivy League schools do not provide athletic scholarships in any capacity.\nLacrosse, along with most other Division I sports and all Division II sports, is an equivalency scholarship sport, meaning that coaches pool the scholarship money they are provided and award it to both new recruits and current players. This model is different than a head-count sport, where every member of the team is guaranteed a full-ride scholarship. Combining an academic merit scholarship with athletic performance scholarships is how students have the opportunity to achieve a full ride in equivalency sports.\nNCAA men's lacrosse.\nThe National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is the largest association and governing body of collegiate athletics in the United States. The NCAA holds lacrosse championships for all three Divisions in men's and women's lacrosse. As of the 2023 season (2022–23 school year), the NCAA has 398 men's lacrosse programs and 528 women's lacrosse programs.\nDivision I men's lacrosse.\nIn the 2023 season, Division I men's lacrosse had the smallest number of teams compared to the Division II and Division III levels. The most recent 2023 NCAA lacrosse season involved 76 NCAA Division I men's lacrosse teams organized into 10 conferences. These teams are heavily concentrated in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, and only five teams are not in the Eastern Time Zone (Air Force, Denver, Lindenwood, Marquette, and Utah).\nFrom 1936 through 1970 the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) selected the Wingate Memorial Trophy winners as national champions based on regular season records. Beginning in 1971, the National Collegiate Athletic Association began holding an annual championship tournament. Cornell took the first title over Maryland, 12–6. Syracuse has 11 Division I titles (*one vacated later), Johns Hopkins 9, Virginia (7) and Princeton 6. The NCAA national championship weekend tournament normally draws over 80,000 fans. The most recent national champions from 2023 are the Notre Dame Fighting Irish.\nThe most recent change to the conference lineup was announced in October 2023, when the Northeast Conference (NEC), which had dropped the sport after the 2022 season, reinstated the sport effective with the 2025 season. The last previous change was announced during the 2022 NCAA tournament, when the Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10) made official its widely-rumored sponsorship of men's lacrosse effective in the 2023 season. This move, along with other moves during the early-2020s conference realignment, led to the NEC and Southern Conference dropping men's lacrosse after the 2022 season, although as noted the NEC's elimination of men's lacrosse proved to be temporary.\nTwo men's lacrosse schools started transitions from Division II to Division I in July 2022. Lindenwood and Queens (NC) are playing men's lacrosse in the Atlantic Sun Conference (ASUN), with Queens as a full member and Lindenwood as an affiliate. Hartford began a transition from Division I to Division III in the 2021–22 school year; the 2023 season was its last in Division I before joining the Commonwealth Coast Conference in July 2023. Le Moyne started a transition from D-II to D-I in the 2023–24 school year, joining the NEC and playing as an independent in 2024 before the reinstatement of NEC men's lacrosse in 2025.\nIn September 2018 the NCAA rules committee implemented an 80-second shot clock that begins upon possession. A team must advance the ball across midfield within the first 20 seconds, and then 60 seconds to shoot the ball once across midfield. The clock will only reset if the ball hits the goalie or the post. Failure to score before the shot clock runs out results in a change of possession.\nDivision II men's lacrosse.\nDivision II lacrosse is made up of 77 teams, mainly located in the Northeast and Southeast. The USILA conducted a \"small college\" lacrosse championship tournament in 1972 and 1973. Division II men's lacrosse held its first NCAA tournament in 1974 with an eight-team bracket. The format remained the same until 1980, when the field dropped to just two teams as the Division III tournament was inaugurated. From 1982 through 1992, a Division II playoff was not conducted. In 2001, a four-team bracket was instituted. The Division II men’s lacrosse championship bracket expanded from four to eight teams starting with the 2013 season. Adelphi University currently holds the record for the number of D-II championships, with seven and also appeared in the championship a record 11 times.\nNCAA Division II lacrosse programs are organized into eight conferences, as well as independent programs consisting of mainly new D-II lacrosse teams. The newest addition to the roster of Division II men's lacrosse conferences came in 2017–18 when the Great Lakes Valley Conference began sponsoring men's lacrosse.\nOn December 2, 2014; the University of Alabama In Huntsville (UAH) announced the additional of Men's and Women's Lacrosse programs. These programs began competition with the 2016 season, initially as independents.\nThe most recent Division II men's national champions are the Lenoir–Rhyne Bears.\nConferences:\nDivision III men's lacrosse.\nThe majority of schools playing NCAA men's lacrosse play in Division III, with 245 in all. Most Division III lacrosse teams are located in the Northeast, with only seven programs west of the Mississippi River (with two others in cities on that river's east bank). Only two of these schools are west of the Central Time Zone. The USILA conducted a \"small college\" championship in 1972 and 1973. The NCAA Division III championship originally was combined with Division II from 1974–1979, before the NCAA split the non-Division I schools into separate Division II and III tournaments in 1980. Salisbury University shares the record for most D-III championships with 13, and has sole possession of the record for most championship game appearances with 18. The other holder of the record for most championships, Hobart, won the championship the first 12 years it was held from 1980–1991, and appeared in the championship game 15 times. The 12 consecutive championships are an NCAA record but Hobart has not won again since 1993, and now plays at the Division I level.\nNCAA Division III lacrosse programs are organized into 22 conferences and over 20 independent programs. The number of conferences dropped by two after the 2023 season; the New England Collegiate Conference, with only four full members in that season, disbanded as an all-sports conference, while the Colonial States Athletic Conference and United East Conference merged under the United East banner.\nThe defending Division III national champions are the Salisbury Sea Gulls.\nConferences:\nNCAA women's lacrosse.\nWomen's college lacrosse differs significantly from men's lacrosse in terms of rules and equipment. The NCAA holds lacrosse championships for all three divisions and currently has 528 women's lacrosse programs. Women's collegiate lacrosse was originally governed by the U.S. Women's Lacrosse Association, which joined with the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) to determine an annual champion. The USWLA and AIAW conducted championships from 1978–1982 before being usurped by the NCAA. The NCAA began sponsoring a Division III championship in 1985 and added a Division II championship in 2001.\nDivision I women's lacrosse.\nThe NCAA began sponsoring a women's lacrosse championship in 1982. Lacrosse has grown into 127 NCAA Division I women's lacrosse teams organized into 15 conferences. Only 13 programs are located outside the Eastern Time Zone— Denver, Lindenwood, Marquette, Northwestern, Vanderbilt, six Pac-12 Conference members, and two California schools outside the Pac-12. Of these 13 schools, only Denver, Lindenwood, and Marquette also sponsor varsity men's lacrosse.\nThe most recent change to the lineup of women's lacrosse conferences came during the 2021 offseason, when the Southern Conference (SoCon) dropped women's lacrosse. The three full SoCon members that sponsored the sport (Furman, Mercer, Wofford) became single-sport members of the Big South Conference, while the two associate members, Coastal Carolina and Delaware State, rejoined Atlantic Sun Conference (ASUN) women's lacrosse.\nSix schools started Division I play in the 2023 season. Three existing D-I members launched new teams in that season—Clemson competes in its all-sports home of the ACC; Fairleigh Dickinson competes in its all-sports home of the Northeast Conference (NEC), and Xavier played as an independent before joining its full-time home of the Big East Conference in the 2024 season. Three others began transitions from D-II to D-I in July 2022. Lindenwood and Queens (NC) play women's lacrosse in the ASUN, with Queens as a full member and Lindenwood as an associate member, while Stonehill plays in its new full-time home of the NEC. The 2023 season was the last for Hartford in Division I competition; it played that season as an independent before joining the Division III Commonwealth Coast Conference. The NEC added transitional D-I member Le Moyne for the 2024 season.\nThe 2024 season will also see the debut of South Florida in its full-time home of the American Athletic Conference. Two schools will debut in the 2025 season—Charlotte in The American, which it joined in July 2023, and Rhode Island in its full-time home of the Atlantic 10 Conference. The 2025 season will also see the debut of Big 12 Conference women's lacrosse.\nThe current Division I national champions are the Northwestern Wildcats.\nConferences:\nDivision II women's lacrosse.\nA total of 113 programs compete at the Division II level. Division II women's lacrosse is one of the newest championships sponsored by the NCAA. The first Division II women's lacrosse championship was held in 2001, when C.W. Post beat West Chester 13–9. Since then, the Division II level has been dominated, much like its men's counterpart, by Adelphi University with nine national championships, most recently in 2019. \nThe 114 NCAA Division II women's lacrosse programs are organized into 10 conferences, as well as independent programs.\nThe defending Division II national champions are the Pace Setters.\nConferences:\nDivision III women's lacrosse.\nThe NCAA Division III level is made up of 288 women's lacrosse teams. It is the largest women's lacrosse division and also the largest NCAA lacrosse division, surpassing the number of men's Division III teams by 43 members.\nAs noted in the Division III men's lacrosse section, the number of conferences dropped by two in the 2024 season, with the New England Collegiate Conference disbanding and the Colonial States Athletic Conference merging into the United East Conference.\nThe defending Division III national champions are the Middlebury Panthers.\nConferences:\nNAIA lacrosse.\nAs of October, 2016, There are a 39 National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) schools that offer men’s and/or women’s varsity lacrosse, Lacrosse is an officially recognized sport by the NAIA. NAIA programs are currently in year two of NAIA invitational sport status. During this phase of recognition, teams compete to participate in a post season championship called the NAIA National Invitational. Each conference and A.I.I group receive one automatic qualifier with the remaining four bids going to the highest remaining teams from the NAIA national ranking. NAIA programs also regularly compete against NCAA DII and DIII teams. The Wolverine-Hoosier Athletic Conference (WHAC) announced on January 27, 2012, the addition of lacrosse for both men and women as conference sports effective the fall of 2012. The WHAC was the first conference in the NAIA to offer lacrosse as a conference championship sport. The Appalachian Athletics Conference and the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference recognized lacrosse as a conference sport in the Fall of 2015.\nNJCAA lacrosse.\nThe National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) is the primary governing body of community college athletic programs in the USA and currently oversees 21 men's and 11 women's lacrosse programs predominately in the Northeastern United States. The NJCAA lacrosse programs do not compete in their regular conferences, but instead are ranked within their NJCAA Regions. The NJCAA has sponsored a men's lacrosse championship since 1970 and a women's lacrosse championship since 2004. There are also new lacrosse programs at community colleges that are not members of the NJCAA, such as the California Community College Athletic Association, which does not sponsor the sport at this time.\nMen's club lacrosse.\nMen's Collegiate Lacrosse Association (MCLA).\nThe Men's Collegiate Lacrosse Association (MCLA), formerly known as the US Lacrosse Men’s Division of Intercollegiate Associates (USL MDIA), is a national organization of non-NCAA, college men's lacrosse programs. The MCLA was created by the MDIA Board of Directors and its creation was announced by US Lacrosse on August 24, 2006. The MCLA oversees play and conducts national championships for 184 non-NCAA men's lacrosse programs in 10 conferences and in two divisions throughout the country.\nThe defending 2023 National Champions at the MCLA Division 1 Level are the Concordia-Irvine Eagles. The Division II National Champions are the Dayton Flyers.\nConferences:\nNational College Lacrosse League (NCLL).\nThe National College Lacrosse League (NCLL) is a men's lacrosse league comprising mostly Eastern US college lacrosse clubs (non-varsity). There are approximately 130 teams divided into 12 conferences. The programs are split into Division I and Division II. Many of the clubs are at schools that currently have varsity NCAA Men's lacrosse programs.\nConferences:\nWomen's club lacrosse.\nWomen's Collegiate Lacrosse Associates (WCLA).\nThe Women's Collegiate Lacrosse Associates (WCLA) is a collection of over 260 college club teams that compete under the US Lacrosse umbrella. Teams are organized into various leagues and two divisions. The association regulates different aspects of the teams, including minimum number of games played. A recent rule modification allows community colleges to become members. Teams that have been classified as either Division I or Division II have the opportunity to compete in a national championship each spring under US Lacrosse."

        "text": "Pittsburgh Panthers women's basketball is the NCAA Division I intercollegiate women's basketball program of the University of Pittsburgh, often referred to as \"Pitt\", located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Pitt women's basketball team competes in the Atlantic Coast Conference and plays their home games in the Petersen Events Center. The university first sponsored women's basketball on the varsity level in 1914 and have appeared in five straight national post-season tournaments between 2006 and 2010.\nHistory.\nWomen's intercollegiate varsity basketball at the University of Pittsburgh began during the 1914–1915 season and found early success until 1926–1927 after which it was disbanded in favor of intramural sports programs. Varsity basketball for women was reinstated during the 1970–1971 season. Although participants were awarded varsity letters and competed intercollegiately, the program wasn't taken over by the Athletic Department until the 1974–1975 season. During the 1970s, the team earned several EAIAW regional tournament appearances. Pitt began competing in the Big East Conference in 1982, and the Panthers won the Big East regular season championship in 1984. Pitt appeared in the National Women's Invitational Tournament in 1981 and 1994 as well as the Women's National Invitation Tournament in 2000 and 2006 before earning its first ever NCAA tournament appearance in 2007, where they advanced to the second round before losing to eventual national champion Tennessee. The Panthers then advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in 2008 and 2009, and made their fifth straight post-season tournament appearance in the WNIT in 2010. On April 12, 2013, Pitt hired Suzie McConnell-Serio to replace Berenato as head coach. Pitt moved to the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) beginning with the 2013–14 season.\nPostseason.\nNCAA (4): 2007, 2008, 2009, 2015\nPitt reached the \"Sweet Sixteen\" in 2008 and 2009.\nNWIT and WNIT (5): 1981, 1994, 2000, 2006, 2010\nPitt was the NWIT Consolation Winner in 1981 (5th Place), won the NWIT Third Place game in 1994, and reached the WNIT \"Final Four\" in 2006.\nEAIAW regional championship tournaments (6):\n1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981\nHonors.\nAcademic All-Americans.\nPam Miklasevich, 1981 College Sports Information Directors of America\nPoints club.\n22 total Panther players have achieved the 1,000 points club with three scoring over 2,000 points.\nPPG = points per game\nWNBA.\nThe following former Pitt basketball players have or are currently playing in the WNBA.\nDraft.\nThe following players were selected in the WNBA draft.\nYear by year results.\nPitt's varsity women's basketball program, the only women's varsity sport at the school during that time, was started in the 1914–15 season and continued until 1926–1927 when it was dropped in favor of a program of intramural women's athletics that could provide more opportunities for the female students at the university. The varsity women's basketball program was revived for the 1970–71 season and moved under the auspices of the athletic department in 1974–75. Records prior to the 1974–75 are largely incomplete (see notes)."

The program began as a club team, becoming a varsity sport in 1996 and an official NCAA sport in 2003. The Cornhuskers have since established themselves as the NCAA's premier bowling program. Nebraska has won eleven national championships, finished runner-up four times, and is the only program to qualify for every NCAA Bowling Championship.\nHistory.\nNebraska's bowling program began in 1990 as a club sport, coached by Bill Straub, who led the team to WIBC national titles in 1991 and 1995. Bowling became an official varsity sport at NU in 1996, and Straub was hired as the full-time head coach, winning additional national titles in 1997, 1999, and 2001. In 2003, the NCAA sanctioned its first women's bowling tournament, which Nebraska won. The Cornhuskers won the following year as well, and have since won three more titles and finished runner-up four times. The program has never been ranked lower than seventh.

        "title": "1986 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament",
        "text": "The 1986 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament began on March 12 and ended on March 30. The tournament expanded to 40 teams from 32. The Final Four consisted of Texas, Tennessee, Western Kentucky, and USC, with Texas defeating Southern California, 97-81 in the championship game. Texas's Clarissa Davis was named the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament. With their championship win, Texas completed the first undefeated season (34-0) since the NCAA began sponsoring women's basketball in 1982.\nESPN expanded their coverage to show all four Regional finals and the National semifinals. CBS continued to broadcast the Championship game.\nNotable events.\nJames Madison opened their regular season with a game against Virginia, which the Cavaliers won by 14 points, 71–57. James Madison went on to a regular season record of 26–3, which earned them an 8 seed in the Tournament. As the higher seed, they were eligible to play their first-round game at home, but they were unable to host, so played their opponent, Providence at the home court of Providence. James Madison won the close game 55–53, to move on to the second round. Their opponent would be Virginia, who earned a number 1 seed in the tournament. The game started out with the Cavaliers taking five points with just over eleven minutes to go in the first half. The JMU Dukes then held Virginia to only a single field goal for the rest of the half and took an eleven-point lead at halftime. The two teams would play roughly evenly in the second half, with Virginia only managing to reduce the lead by two points. James Madison won the game 71–62, advancing to the regional semifinal, which was the first time in the five-year history of the NCAA Tournament that a team had defeated a number 1 seed prior to the Regional round.\nAfter earning a number one national ranking in 1984, but stumbling in the regional's finals to national power Louisiana Tech, Texas seemed poised for a better result in 1985. Not only did the team earn another top national ranking, but they entered the NCAA Tournament knowing that if they reached the Final Four, they would have the home court advantage with the final games scheduled for their own Frank Erwin Center. Home court would play a part, but not the part hoped for by the Longhorns. In the regional semi-finals, played at the home court of Western Kentucky University, the Hilltoppers stymied the Longhorn's hopes with a 92–90 victory. They would return to the 1986 tournament viewed as one of the top teams in the nation and were once again ranked the top team in the nation, but they still did not have a Final Four NCAA appearance on their resume.\nThe Texas team won their first game easily, then continued to the regional, this time on their home court. They dispatched Oklahoma easily, then struggled against Mississippi, who were trying to prevent the team from a Final Four yet again. This time, Texas prevailed and beat Mississippi by three points to head to their first NCAA Final Four. Their opponent in the semifinal was none other than Western Kentucky, who had denied them the previous year. This time, the result would be very different, as the Longhorns beat Western Kentucky easily, 90–65.\nThe other semifinal pitted Tennessee against Southern California. Cheryl Miller was the best player at USC, and had led the team to the national championship in 1984. Miller went on to play for the USA national team and helped the USA win the gold medal at the 1984 Olympics. 1986 was Miller's senior year at USC. The game between Tennessee and USC was a rematch of a physical game played in December, in which Miller was thrown out of the game for an elbow. The game was close, but USC ended up with an 85–77 win. In the rematch, Miller would again come out of the game, but under very different circumstances. She was worried about getting hurt, and with a 70–51 lead, didn't need to stay in. In that game, USC won by 24 points, 83–59.\nThat set up the championship game between USC and undefeated Texas. The Texas team was very deep but had suffered a number of injuries during the year. The game was close early with the Trojans leading at times in the first half, but Texas went on a 10–2 run to take a seven-point lead. Miller would have one of the worst games in her career. Although she scored 16 points, twelve of those were from the free throw line. She was only 2 for 11 from the field, without a single point in the second half. In contrast, Texas' Clarissa Davis came off the bench to score 25 and earn Most Outstanding Player honors. USC's Cynthia Cooper scored 27 points, and Texas won the national championship 97–81 to complete the first undefeated season in NCAA history.\nRecords.\nCheryl Miller set the Final Four record of free throws in a single game with 12, in the championship game.\nClarissa Davis set the Final Four record for rebounds in a half, with 14 in the second half of the semifinal game.\nThe National Championship game between Texas and USC set several Final Four scoring marks:\nTexas had 23 assists in the semi-final game, a record (since 1985, when the category was established), and followed that with 22 in the championship game.\nKamie Ethridge had 20 assists in the two Final Four games, a record for the combined Final Four games.\nQualifying teams – automatic.\nForty teams were selected to participate in the 1986 NCAA Tournament. Seventeen conferences were eligible for an automatic bid to the 1986 NCAA tournament.\nQualifying teams – at-large.\nTwenty-three additional teams were selected to complete the forty invitations.\nBids by conference.\nTwenty-one conferences earned an automatic bid. In thirteen cases, the automatic bid was the only representative from the conference. Eighteen additional at-large teams were selected from seven of the conferences, plus one independent (not associated with an athletic conference) team earned at-large bids.\nFirst and second rounds.\nIn 1986, the field expanded to 40 teams. The teams were seeded, and assigned to four geographic regions, with seeds 1-10 in each region. In Round 1, seeds 8 and 9 faced each other for the opportunity to face the 1 seed in the second round, while seeds 7 and 10 faced each other for the opportunity to face the 2 seed.\nIn the first two rounds, the higher seed was given the opportunity to host the first-round game. In most cases, the higher seed accepted the opportunity. The exceptions:\nThe following table lists the region, host school, venue and the twenty-four first round locations:\nRegionals and Final Four.\nThe regionals, named for the general location, were held from March 20 to March 23 at these sites:\nEach regional winner advanced to the Final Four, held March 28 and March 30 in Lexington, Kentucky at Rupp Arena\nBids by state.\nThe forty teams came from twenty-five states.\nPennsylvania had the most teams with four. Twenty-five states did not have any teams receiving bids.\nBrackets.\nGames played at better seed except where noted.\nRecord by conference.\nSixteen conferences had more than one bid, or at least one win in NCAA Tournament play:\nSeven conferences went 0-1: Gateway, High Country, Metro, MAAC, MAC, Southland, and WAC"

The game was held on July 11, 2000 at Turner Field in Atlanta, Georgia, home of the Atlanta Braves of the National League.\nThe Florida Marlins were originally awarded the 2000 All-Star Game in July 1995, but due to concerns over the chronically low attendance figures at Pro Player Stadium and the long-term viability of the South Florida market, National League president Len Coleman revoked the game from Miami in December 1998. The Marlins finally got to host the All-Star Game for the first time, 17 years later.\nColeman announced Atlanta would be the replacement host of the game, giving the Braves the chance to host their first All-Star Game since 1972. Turner Field, which opened in 1997 played a factor in Coleman's decision to award the game to Atlanta, citing Major League Baseball's desire to have the All-Star Game played in newer venues as a way to showcase the ballparks.\nThe 2000 All-Star Game was one of the few occurrences in which the manager of the host team also managed the home team of the game, in this case, the National League (Bobby Cox had led the Braves to the World Series the previous year earning the right to manage the National League).\nThe result of the game was the American League defeating the National League by a score of 6–3. The game is remembered for Chipper Jones' home run off James Baldwin. This was also the last MLB All-Star Game that was broadcast on NBC.

        "title": "Dayton Flyers men's basketball",
        "text": "The Dayton Flyers men's basketball team is a college basketball program that competes in NCAA Division I and the Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10) representing the University of Dayton in Ohio. The Flyers play their home games at University of Dayton Arena. The Flyers are coached by Anthony Grant who is in his seventh season. In March 2020, Dayton was ranked #3 in the AP Top 25 Poll, its highest ranking since the 1955–56 season when it was ranked #2. The Flyers have never been ranked #1, but Dayton did receive a lone first place vote in the final AP poll of the 2019–2020 season. When the 2020 seasons was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Flyers did not get to participate in the 2020 NCAA Tournament, despite being projected as a #1 seed by several outlets.\nA 2015 study of college basketball team valuations placed Dayton No. 23 in the nation with 2014 adjusted revenues in excess of $16.6 million (highest for non-football conference programs) and a valuation of nearly $84 million (second highest for non-football conference programs and higher than programs such as Florida, Texas, and Michigan).\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe first collegiate basketball team began play at Dayton, then known as St. Mary's Institute, during the 1903–04 season. The school's early teams were informally nicknamed \"The Saints\" by local sportswriters and competed against colleges, high schools, and club teams throughout the Ohio, Michigan, Indiana and New York region. Early rivalries with Notre Dame and Miami (Ohio) began in the 1908–09 season, and with Ohio State in the 1913–14 season. Fr. William O'Malley is recognized as the first coach of the Saints, but the team had no coach for the first six seasons. Harry Solimano, believed to be a former Saints player, succeeded O'Malley in the 1910 season and coached the team four seasons and again for the 1919–20 seasons. In 1920 the school changed its name to the University of Dayton and its sports teams gradually became known as the Flyers. Also in 1920, the school began playing nearby Xavier University, a rivalry that has spawned 156 meetings as of 2014. Games were originally played in an on-campus gymnasium, but later (1969) moved to the nearby University of Dayton Arena. Harry Baujan became both the football and basketball coach in 1923 and later became the school's athletic director. Through the 1920s and 1930s, the basketball program was subordinate to the football program with respect to resources and athletic department focus. In 1939, Baujan hired James Carter as both an assistant football coach and head basketball coach. Carter moved to expand Dayton's national profile by issuing basketball scholarships and scheduling trips to east coast basketball powers such as St John's and St Joseph's. Carter is also recognized as the first Dayton coach to play an African American student-athlete. World War II brought a two-year hiatus to the basketball program between 1943 and 1945. Most people think \"America's Team\" refers to the Dallas Cowboys. However, it was originally coined in 1945, referring to the Dayton Flyers Men's Basketball team.\nThe Tom Blackburn era—national emergence.\nIn 1947, Tom Blackburn succeeded Carter as the school's first full-time head basketball coach. Blackburn, noted as a strict disciplinarian, recruited many former military men to his early squads and began to shift Dayton's scheduling focus from strictly local Ohio collegiate teams to a more regional focus, starting series with such programs as Louisville in 1947–48 season. Blackburn would recruit future NBA player Don Meineke, along with local standouts Junior Norris &amp; Chuck Grigsby in 1948 to form the nucleus of the school's first nationally recognized teams. The 1950–51 Flyers reached #13 in the AP Poll and the finals of the NIT before bowing out to Brigham Young. The following year, the Flyers also reached the NIT Finals, while also participating in the NCAA tournament for the first time, finishing in the regional semi-final. In light of the school's growing national stature and increasing fan base, the university constructed the 5,800 seat on-campus University of Dayton Fieldhouse in 1950. Blackburn established Dayton as a national basketball power, winning the National Invitation Tournament in 1962, reaching the NIT finals six times during the 1950s and early 1960s, and securing a #2 AP ranking for most of the 1955–1956 season. The foundation established by Blackburn led to Dayton being the most successful Division I basketball program through the 1950s and 1960s.\nThe Don Donoher era—national runner up.\nTom Blackburn became ill with terminal lung cancer during the 1963–64 season. Don Donoher, a former Dayton player and assistant coach took over for the final three games of the 1963–64 season. Blackburn died in March, and Dayton formally named Donoher as his successor. Donoher, with Assistant Coach Chuck Grigsby, guided the Flyers to the NCAA Sweet Sixteen in his first two years as coach; they then led the Flyers to the 1967 NCAA Championship game by beating Western Kentucky, #8 ranked Tennessee, Virginia Tech, and #4 ranked North Carolina, before falling to #1 ranked and eventual champion UCLA 79–64 in the final. Donoher's 1967–68 squad began the season ranked #6 in the country in the AP Poll, but faltered in early competition and finished with a 17–9 record, missing the NCAA tournament. Nonetheless, Donoher's Flyers made a successful run through the 1968 NIT field, besting Kansas in the championship to win their second NIT crown. The Flyers would again face UCLA in a pivotal NCAA tournament game in 1974. The 20–7 Flyers squared off against the Bruins in the West Regional Sweet Sixteen and took the Bill Walton-led seven consecutive NCAA Champions to three overtimes before eventually falling 111–100. Donoher would again lead the Flyers to NCAA success in 1984 as Roosevelt Chapman led Flyers bested LSU, #7 ranked Oklahoma, and #15 ranked Washington before falling in the Elite Eight to eventual national champion Georgetown. The 24-season Donoher era was arguably Dayton's finest, producing eight NCAA tournament invitations, and eight NIT invitations. Following the success of the 1967 National Runner Up squad, the university began planning for a new 13,500 seat facility to house the nationally prominent Flyers. The UD Arena became the Flyer's home court at the start of the 1969–70 season.\nDayton resisted the trend towards league affiliation that began to sweep over college basketball in the 1970s and early 1980s. Instead, Dayton formed an informal home-home scheduling alliance with peer programs such as DePaul, Marquette, and Notre Dame during the early-mid 1980s in an effort to fill their schedules with quality opponents. Dayton was approached as early as 1978 to join what would eventually become the Horizon League, but avoided league affiliation until the 1987–88 season when the school began play in the future Horizon League, then the Midwestern Collegiate Conference.\nThe Jim O'Brien era.\nFollowing three successive losing seasons, Donoher retired after the 1988–89 season. He was succeeded by Jim O'Brien, former head basketball coach at Wheeling Jesuit University. The Flyers won the MCC conference tournament in 1990, and defeated Illinois in the first round of the NCAA tournament before bowing out to eventual Final Four participant Arkansas in the second round, 86–84. The Flyers moved to the Great Midwest Conference in 1993, but produced a dismal 1–23 conference record over their two seasons of league play. O'Brien was dismissed following the 1993–94 season after successive 4–26 and 6–21 seasons, their worst in modern school history.\nThe Oliver Purnell era.\nDayton turned to Old Dominion head basketball coach Oliver Purnell to resurrect their moribund basketball program. The dissolution of the Great Midwest Conference in 1995 and subsequent snub by former conference mates in joining the new Conference USA further complicated Purnell's rebuilding task. In 1995 the Flyers accepted an invitation to join the A10, where they remain today. Purnell guided the Flyers to the 1998 NIT, the school's first post-season appearance in eight seasons. Purnell would lead the Flyers back to the NCAA tournament in 2000 following the Co-SIDA Classic Championship, an 11–5 conference record and non-conference victories over #12 ranked Kentucky, New Mexico, and rival Marquette. Purnell's 2000–01 team earned the program's first national ranking for the school since 1974 following victories over #12 UConn and #6 Maryland in the 2000 Maui Invitational Tournament. Dayton would go on to reach the quarterfinals of the 2001 NIT. Dayton would again make the NIT field in 2002. The 2002–03 season would mark the completion of Purnell's rebuilding project as the Flyers compiled a 24–6 record and reached as high as #16 in the AP Poll following victories over #21 Cincinnati, #13 Marquette, and two wins over #25 St Joseph's en route to their first Atlantic 10 championship. The Flyers earned a #4 seed in the 2003 NCAA tournament, but fell to Tulsa in the first round. Following the season, Purnell accepted an offer to become the Clemson head basketball coach.\nThe Brian Gregory era.\nOn April 9, 2003, the University of Dayton announced that Michigan State assistant Brian Gregory would become the 18th head basketball coach for the Flyers. Gregory enjoyed immediate success with his new team, guiding the senior-laden Flyers to a 24–9 record, the 2003 Maui Invitational Tournament Championship and a berth in the NCAA tournament in his inaugural season. The 2006–07 team finished the season 19–12 with wins over NCAA tournament bound Louisville, Creighton, Holy Cross, Miami, and George Washington.\nThe Flyers opened the 2007–08 campaign with a 14–1 record and wins over 12th-ranked Louisville, sixth-ranked Pitt, and 22nd-ranked Rhode Island. On December 31, 2008, the team was voted into both Top 25 polls for the first time since 2003. The team reached as high as 14th in the AP Poll and 18th in the Coaches Poll. However injuries to Chris Wright and Charles Little derailed Dayton's season. The Flyers finished 9–10 in conference play, but 23–11 overall and were able to reach the quarterfinals of the NIT, losing at Ohio State.\nThe Flyers built upon the progress of the 2007–08 season by compiling a 27–8 overall record (11–5 Atlantic-10) and defeating No. 15 Marquette and No. 17 Xavier en route to an NCAA tournament berth. The Flyers stunned higher seeded West Virginia before bowing out to Kansas in the Second Round. The 2009–10 Flyers began the season with high expectations, but faltered in league play to miss the NCAA tournament. However, the Flyers regrouped to storm through the NIT bracket, defeating Cincinnati and Illinois on their home floors and besting Ole Miss and North Carolina in New York to win the 2010 NIT Championship, the school's third NIT title. Gregory compiled a 172–94 record with the Flyers through eight seasons, leading them to two NCAAs and three NITs. Gregory also recruited future NBA players Brian Roberts, Chris Wright, and Chris Johnson, Dayton's first NBA players since Negele Knight in 1990. Gregory accepted the head coaching position at Georgia Tech following the 2010–11 season.\nThe Archie Miller era.\nThe Dayton Flyers turned to Arizona assistant Archie Miller in 2011 to lead the program. Miller's first team won the 2011 Old Spice Classic, shocked No. 16-ranked Alabama and reached the 2012 NIT as a No. 2 seed, but would lose in the first round.\nThe 2013–14 Dayton Flyers men's basketball team placed third in the 2013 Maui Invitational, beating No. 11-ranked Gonzaga and California. The 2013–14 team experienced a mid-season swoon due to injuries, but entered A-10 tournament play on a 9–1 run with victories over league rivals No. 17 Saint Louis, UMass and George Washington.\nDayton received a No. 11 seed as an at-large team to the 2014 NCAA tournament South Region. The Flyers faced in-state foe Ohio State in the second round, winning a thrilling 60–59 decision. The Flyers next faced Syracuse in the third round and again upset the heavily favored higher seed 55–53 to reach the Sweet Sixteen for the first time in three decades. The Flyers advanced to the Elite Eight with an 82–72 victory over Stanford in the Sweet Sixteen, but fell to Florida in the South Regional Championship, 62–52.\nThe 2014–15 team began the season with high expectations as the Flyers returned a solid nucleus of experienced players. The Flyers placed third in the 2014 Puerto Rico Tip-Off, besting Texas A&amp;M and Boston College. However, the Flyers suffered a seemingly debilitating setback when two front court players were dismissed from the team in mid-December. Coupled with season-ending injuries to other players and the loss of a freshman to NCAA partial qualifier status, the Flyers were left with only six scholarship players, none of whom were taller than 6'6\". The Flyers regrouped and finished the non-conference part of their season with wins over Georgia Tech and Ole Miss. The Flyers carried this momentum into league play and finished second in the Atlantic 10 regular season with a 13–5 mark. The Flyers squared off against VCU in the Atlantic 10 Tournament Championship game, but fell 71–65.\nDespite an RPI ranking of 32, the Flyers were placed in the First Four of the 2015 NCAA tournament against Boise State in the East Region. In their First Four play-in game, Dayton beat Boise State, advancing to the Round of 64. The Flyers pulled off another upset of a No. 6 seed in the NCAA Tournament, beating the Providence by double digits, 66–53, thus advancing to the Round of 32. However, they fell to No. 13 Oklahoma in the third round.\nThe 2015–16 team was predicted to win the A-10. They started the season well beating No. 21 Vanderbilt and finishing the non-conference schedule at 10–2. They finished in a first place tie in the A-10 season and earned their third consecutive trip to the NCAA tournament. However, they could not repeat past success as they were upset by eventual Final Four participant Syracuse in the First Round.\nIn 2017, the Flyers won the regular season championship of the A-10 by one game over VCU. However, they were upset in the quarterfinals of the A-10 tournament. The Flyers did receive an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as a No. 7 seed. In the First Round, they faced Wichita State who many argued was underrated as a No. 10 seed. The Flyers would lose to Wichita State 64–58. On March 25, 2017, Archie Miller left the school to accept the head coaching position at Indiana. He finished with a six-year record of 139–63 at Dayton.\nThe Anthony Grant era.\nShortly after Miller's departure for Indiana, the school hired Oklahoma City Thunder assistant coach and Dayton alum Anthony Grant as head coach on March 30, 2017. Grant previously served as head coach at VCU and Alabama. Grant began laying the groundwork for the future with his first recruiting class that included future stars Obi Toppin and Jalen Crutcher. His first season at Dayton saw the Flyers finish 14–17 overall, the first time since the 2005–06 season that the team finished with a losing record. His second season featured breakout red-shirt freshman Toppin, who led the team to a third-place finish in the A-10. They lost their first game of the conference tournament, and missed the NCAA tournament for the second straight season. They earned a five seed in the NIT, but lost in the first round at Colorado.\nGrant's third season proved to be one of the best in Dayton basketball history. The 2019–20 team began by routing Georgia and Virginia Tech en route to the finals of the 2019 Maui Invitational Tournament where they lost in overtime to Kansas. The Flyers steadily climbed the 2019–2020 AP Poll, finishing the season 29–2, 18–0 in Atlantic 10 Conference play and ranked number three in the nation. Dayton was the only team in the nation not to have lost in regulation during the 2019–20 season and was a projected #1 seed in the East Region in several NCAA tournament bracket projections. However, the COVID-19 pandemic led to the cancellation of the 2020 NCAA tournament on March 12, 2020, prior to completion of the Atlantic 10 tournament and the NCAA opted not to release the Men's and Women's Championship brackets. A post cancellation computer simulation of Jerry Palm's projected field resulted in Dayton winning the championship. Despite the abrupt end, the season yielded numerous highlights for the team and program. Toppin &amp; Crutcher were both named to the Atlantic 10 Conference First Team, while teammates Trey Landers and Ryan Mikesell were named to the Third Team and All-Academic Teams respectively. Toppin was named the Atlantic 10 Player of the Year and Grant was named A-10 Coach of the Year. Toppin was a unanimous selection to the AP All-America First Team, and would receive further recognition, winning the Wooden Award, Naismith Trophy, and being named AP player of the year. Meanwhile, Coach Grant received national coach of the year accolades from Sporting News, as well as winning both the AP coach of the year and Naismith coach of the year award. Finally, ESPN College Gameday made its first ever visit to the Dayton campus on March 7, 2020, highlighting the #3 ranked Flyers and their passionate fan base prior to the final game of the season, a 76–51 victory over George Washington.\nThe fourth season under Anthony Grant started out promising, led by a trio of Senior Guards in Jalen Crutcher, Ibi Watson, and Rodney Chatman, they picked up two wins against SEC foes in Ole Miss and Mississippi State. Unfortunately injuries, along with PF Chase Johnson leaving the team yet again, led to the team under performing. They did pick up a strong road win against 23rd ranked Saint Louis, giving them a perfect 1–0 record versus AP ranked teams on the season, as well as advancing to the quarterfinals of the 2021 Atlantic 10 tournament. Following the conclusion of the A10 tournament, they earned a bid into the shortened 2021 NIT tournament as a four seed. All games were played at a neutral site in Texas, acting as a \"bubble\". The team lost in the first round after a close game against #1 seed and eventual champions Memphis.\nAtmosphere.\nThe Flyer Faithful.\nThe Flyers are noted for their fan base, dubbed \"The Flyer Faithful.\" The Flyers are routinely in the top-30 in average game attendance among all NCAA Division I basketball programs. As a result of this support, UD Arena is regarded as not only an extremely challenging venue in which to play, but has been hailed as one of the greatest basketball atmospheres in all of college basketball. Additionally, this fan base is noted for its willingness to travel and enthusiastically support the Flyers in both neutral and hostile environments.\nRivalries.\nDayton has historical rivalries with several area teams including Xavier, Miami (Ohio), and Wright State (Gem City Jam), as well as fellow Catholic schools such as Marquette, DePaul, and Notre Dame. Dayton has met Xavier 158 times, more than any other opponent, and holds an 84–75 edge in the series through 2019; however, the Flyers have struggled against Xavier in recent decades, posting a 19–45 record against the Musketeers over the past four decades. Dayton and Xavier played for the Blackburn/McCafferty Trophy.\nWith the departure of Xavier to the Big East in 2013, Dayton searched for a new Atlantic 10 rivalry game that involved a trophy. Each year Dayton plays Atlantic 10 rival Saint Louis University for the rights to the Arch Baron Cup. The team has developed a similar rivalry with the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Rams since the exit of Xavier from the Atlantic 10 in 2013.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Flyers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 19 times. Their combined record is 20–21.\nNCAA tournament seeding history.\n\"The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\"\nNIT results.\nThe Flyers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 27 times. Their combined record is 41–25. They are three time NIT champions (1962, 1968, 2010). The Flyers also turned down a 2023 NIT invitation due to health and safety.\nPlayers.\nAll-time statistic leaders.\n1,000-point scorers.\nThe Flyers currently have been 51 players who have scored 1,000 points as a Flyer. Additionally, they have three other players who have transferred to UD and scored their 1,000th point in a Flyer uniform.\nRoosevelt Chapman is the all-time leading scorer at UD with 2,233 points. Hank Finkel owns the highest scoring average at 23.7 points per game\nBusiness value.\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal report—annual college basketball value ranking reports, University of Dayton's basketball team are ranked in the top 20 (18th) in the US with $100,010,000 value based on the financial data of 2017."

Sixty-four NCAA Division I college baseball teams met after having played their way through a regular season, and for some, a conference tournament, to play in the NCAA tournament. The tournament culminated with 8 teams in the College World Series at historic Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, Nebraska.\nAfter winning the regional and super regional rounds of the 2006 NCAA Division I baseball tournament, eight teams advanced to Omaha. Clemson, , North Carolina, , Oregon State, , , and Miami (FL) all won their super-regionals and made the trip to the 2006 College World Series. Five national seeds advanced to Omaha: Clemson (1), Rice (2), Cal State Fullerton (5), Georgia (7), and Georgia Tech (8). Third-seeded and sixth-seeded both fell in the regionals, while the fourth seed lost in super regional play.\nThe first pitch of the 2006 CWS was Friday, June 16, at 1:00 PM CDT (18:00 UTC). The 2006 tournament was only the second time in CWS history in which 16 games were played (the other being the 2003 College World Series).\nAfter losing their tournament opener to Miami (FL), the Oregon State Beavers staved off elimination for four straight games to win their bracket and advance to the championship series. The , who had not lost a three-game series all season, were shut out in consecutive games by the Beavers and failed to score in a CWS-record 23 innings. Oregon State advanced to face North Carolina in the final.\nThe best-of-three championship series featured Oregon State and North Carolina. Oregon State won the deciding game, 3–2, winning the school's first national title in baseball and its second NCAA championship overall. All games were televised on ESPN and ESPN2.\nOregon State set a CWS record by winning six elimination games (four in bracket play, two in the championship series) and also became the first team ever to lose twice in Omaha and still win the title. Oregon State is the only team besides Holy Cross in 1952 to win six games in the College World Series. Oregon State played in half (eight of 16) of the games in the tournament.\nOSU pitcher Jonah Nickerson was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\nFive-time national champion LSU was left out of the field of 64, the first time since 1988 that the Tigers failed to qualify for a regional. LSU's overall record of 35–24 merited at-large consideration, but it was undone by poor performance in the Southeastern Conference, where the Tigers finished 8th out of 12 teams at 13–17. LSU won national championships in 1991, '93, '96, '97 and 2000 under Hall of Fame coach Skip Bertman, who was the school's athletic director at this time.

India completed the series win with a steady 46-run win, thanks largely in part to Gautam Gambhir's century. The third match was abandoned due to intermittent rain, resulting in a waterlogged pitch – brought on largely in part due to Cyclone Akash which had hit south Bangladesh earlier that day. Leading run scorer of the ODI series and Indian wicket-keeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni took home the player of the series award following a return to form with the bat and 3 dismissals behind the stumps. In the second test match Mohammad Ashraful scored the fastest test fifty in just 27 delivery.\nThe Test series ended in a 1–0 win for India; the first Test was affected by rain, helping Bangladesh secure a draw despite two declarations by India and a 149-run lead on first innings, but in the second Test India only lost three wickets in their three-day innings win.\nODI series.\n2nd ODI.\nGautam Gambhir's 101 was the first century to be made at the Sher-e-Bangla Mirpur Stadium and went on to help India to make the highest team total scored on the ground.\n3rd ODI.\nThe pitch was washed out due to heavy rain from the previous two days, along with heavy winds from Cyclone Akash taking their toll on the ground conditions.

The Final Four consisted of Old Dominion, Northeast Louisiana, Western Kentucky, and Georgia, with Old Dominion defeating Georgia, 70–65 in the championship game. Old Dominion's Tracy Claxton was named the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament.\n1985 is the first year ESPN began televising some of the Tournament games. They televised two of the four Regional finals (East and West Regional), as well as the two national semifinals. The Georgia vs Western Kentucky match up was shown live, while the Old Dominion vs. Northeast Louisiana game was shown tape-delayed. The Championship game was broadcast by CBS.\nNotable events.\nGeorgia faced Western Kentucky in the semi-final. This was a rematch of a game played in December, when Western Kentucky prevailed, 72–67. However, in that game, Katrina McClain had been sidelined with an ankle injury. She was available to play in the Final Four, and achieved a career high total of 25 points. Her teammate, Teresa Edwards, scored 27, and the two helped Georgia win the semi-final 91–78.\nIn the championship game, Georgia took on Old Dominion. The Lady Monarchs weren't hitting their shots, scoring on only 38% of their field goal attempts, but they made up for their misses with rebounds. The Old Dominion team had set an NCAA Final Four record (still standing in 2012) with 57 rebounds in the semi-final game, and they repeated that performance in the championship game, pulling down 57 rebounds and limiting Georgia to 30. The game would be close, but Old Dominion prevailed, 70–65, to win the national Championship.\nRecords.\nIn the second half of the semi-final game between Georgia and Western Kentucky, Georgia scored 57 points while Western Kentucky scored 44. The combined point total of 101 points in a half, as well as the points scored by a single team in a half are both Final Four records, still standing in 2012.\nIn the other semi-final game, Old Dominion pulled down 57 rebounds against Northeast Louisiana. That number still stands as a Final Four rebounds record, although it was tied two days later by Old Dominion in the championship game against Georgia.\nIn a first-round game, Teresa Carmichael of Saint Joseph's University, attempted eleven field goals and hit all eleven. That's the most number of field goal attempts without a miss in tournament history, though 2012.\nQualifying teams – automatic.\nThirty-two teams were selected to participate in the 1985 NCAA Tournament. Eighteen conferences were eligible for an automatic bid to the 1985 NCAA tournament.\nQualifying teams – at-large.\nFourteen additional teams were selected to complete the thirty-two invitations.\nBids by state.\nThe thirty-two teams came from twenty-one states.\nCalifornia and Tennessee had the most teams with four each. Twenty-nine states did not have any teams receiving bids.\nRound 1 venues.\nThe 32 teams were seeded, and assigned to four geographic regions, with seeds 1-8 in each region. In Round 1, the higher seed was given the opportunity to host the first-round game. In each case, the higher seed accepted the opportunity.\nRegionals and Final Four.\nThe regionals, named for the general location, were held from March 21 to March 24 at these sites:\nEach regional winner advanced to the Final Four held March 29 and March 31 in Austin, Texas at the Frank Erwin Center\nRecord by conference.\nEleven conferences had more than one bid, or at least one win in NCAA Tournament play:\nNine conferences went 0-1: Big East, Big Eight, High Country, MAAC, MAC, Missouri Valley Conference, Mountain West, Northern Pacific, and Pacific Coast "

        "title": "History of the England cricket team to 1939",
        "text": "The history of the England cricket team can be said to date back to at least 1739, when sides styled \"Kent\" and \"All England\" played a match at Bromley Common. Over 300 matches involving \"England\" or \"All England\" prior to 1877 are known. However these teams were usually put together on an ad hoc basis and were rarely fully representative.\nThe history of the current England side can be traced to 1877 when England played in what was subsequently recognised as the very first Test match. Since then, up to 20 August 2006 they have played 852 Test matches, winning 298, losing 245 and drawing 309. During these 852 matches, they have been captained by 77 different players.\nEarly history.\nThe term \"All-England\" was first used in reports of two Kent v All-England matches in July 1739.\nThe first match was at Bromley Common in Kent on Monday 9 July 1739. It was billed as between \"eleven gentlemen of that county (i.e., Kent) and eleven gentlemen from any part of England, exclusive of Kent\". Kent, described as \"the Unconquerable County\" won by \"a very few notches\".\nThe second match was at the Artillery Ground in Bunhill Fields, Finsbury on Monday 23 July 1739. This game was drawn and a report includes the phrase \"eleven picked out of all England\".\nIn subsequent decades there were many more such matches between a side representing a county, or the MCC, and a side drawn from the rest of England and described as \"England\" or \"All England\". As the next section describes, in 1846 the term \"All England Eleven\" would acquire a new, more precise, definition.\nThe All-England XI.\nIn 1846 William Clarke formed the All-England Eleven as a touring team of leading players to play matches at big city venues, mainly in the North of England. Clarke's team was a top-class side worthy of its title. The AEE lasted until 1880. In 1852, several players set up the United All-England Eleven as a rival to the AEE, and from 1857 to 1866 the annual match between these two teams was arguably the most important contest of the English season – certainly judged by the quality of the players.\nEarly tours.\nThe early overseas tours were organised as purely commercial ventures, as indeed were the first Test-playing tours. The first such tour was to North America by a team of English professionals, departing England in September 1859. The team comprised six players from the All-England Eleven and six from the United All-England Eleven, and was captained by George Parr. They played five matches, winning them all. There were no first-class fixtures.\nWith the outbreak of the American Civil War, attention turned to Australia. The inaugural tour of the country took place in 1861–2, and was organised by Messrs Spiers &amp; Pond. Led by HH Stephenson, the English team played 12 matches, but none were first-class.\nIn 1863–4, the Melbourne Cricket Club organised a tour by an English team under the captaincy of George Parr, which also visited New Zealand. The team played 16 matches, but none were first-class.\nThere were further tours of North America (taking in both the US and Canada) in late 1868, led by Edgar Willsher, and in late 1872, under R.A. Fitzgerald. The latter side included W.G.Grace.\nIn 1873–4, the Melbourne Cricket Club organised a tour by a team under the captaincy of WG Grace, which played 15 matches, but none were first-class.\nMost of the matches of these early touring teams were played \"against odds\", that is to say the opposing team was permitted to have more than eleven players (usually twenty-two) in order to make a more even contest.\n1877 to 1890.\nJames Lillywhite, a professional with Sussex CCC, led a team which had sailed on the P&amp;O steamship Poonah on 21 September 1876. They played in Australia and then New Zealand before returning to Australia to play a combined Australian XI, for once on even terms of XI a side. The match, starting on 15 March 1877 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, came to be regarded as the first Test match, although none of its participants could have guessed at its significance at the time. Charles Bannerman, of Australia, faced the first ball and scored the first century, a glorious 165 before retiring hurt with a broken finger. The next highest score in this inaugural Test for Australia was Tom Horan with 10. Alfred Shaw of England bowled the first ball and took 5 for 38 in Australia's second innings. Tom Kendall, born in England, took 7 English wickets for 55 to bring Australia victory by 45 runs. 100 years later, in the Centenary Test, the result and margin would be exactly the same. England won a second match to square the series.\nIn 1878/79 Kent captain and MCC luminary Lord Harris took a team, consisting mainly of amateurs, to Australia where they lost by 10 wickets at Melbourne. Their batting was reasonably strong but the lack of professional bowlers cost them dear. The tour became famous for an unseemly incident in a tour game at Sydney where a near riot broke out. One of the umpires was Edmund Barton, who became Australia's first prime minister.\nThe 1880 Australian tourists were the first to play a Test match on English soil. Their 'demon' bowler, Fred Spofforth, sustained a hand injury and, crucially, missed the game in which W.G. Grace scored 152 and Billy Murdoch one run better. Lord Harris led the victorious England side at the Oval.\nAn all professional side, organised by Shaw, Shrewsbury and Lillywhite sailed to Australia for the 1881/82 campaign. The tour was bedeviled with scandal and allegations of fisticuffs, betting and heavy drinking. Tom Garrett took 18 wickets in the three Tests played for Australia. Many of the tour matches were still against local '22's. Australia won the four Test series 2 – 0.\nThe developing rivalry took on a new turn in 1882, when England lost at home at The Oval in the solitary Test of the summer. Spofforth took 7 for 46 and 7 for 44 and Ted Peate, Yorkshire slow left armer who had taken 8 wickets, was out just 8 runs short of victory. Upset at this turn of events, \"The Sporting Times\" printed an obituary to English cricket: \"In Affectionate Remembrance of ENGLISH CRICKET, which died at the Oval on 29th AUGUST 1882, Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and acquaintances R.I.P. N.B. – The body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia.\"\nWhen England toured Australia the following winter of 1882/83 and won 2–1, the England captain, the Hon. Ivo Bligh was presented with an urn that contained some ashes, which have variously been said to be of a bail, ball or even a woman's veil. And so The Ashes series was born. Yorkshire stalwart Billy Bates, who played all his 15 Tests on 5 tours to Australia, scored 55 and took 14 for 102 at Melbourne in the second Test, including the first Test hat-trick, to bring England the first innings victory in Test cricket. A.G. Steel made 135* at Sydney – although he did drop Bonner 4 times (out of 8 drops in total) as the giant Australian hitter scored 87.\nEngland won 1–0 in the three Test series in 1884. Peate took 6 for 85 in Australia's first innings, and Ulyett 7 for 36, the second as England won by an innings Lord's where Steel made a wonderful 148 out of England's first innings of 379. Australia's captain Billy Murdoch scored the first Test double hundred at the Oval where Walter Read of England hit a century in 113 minutes after going in at number 10. All 11 Englishmen bowled in Australia's innings, including wicket keeper Lyttelton with underarm lobs.\nEngland embarked on a long stretch of dominance. They won 14 and lost only 3 of the Tests played between 1884 and 1890. Billy Barnes hit 134 in the opening Adelaide Test of the five Test 1884/85 series while Johnny Briggs of Lancashire hit a two-hour ton at Melbourne in the second, where Australia fielded a completely new team of 11 different players after a dispute over gate money. Wilfred Flowers scored 56 and took 5 for 46 in the third Test at Sydney where Australia pulled back a game thanks to Bonner smashing a century in even time. England won the deciding fifth Test by an innings at Melbourne, Arthur Shrewsbury making 105*.\nW. G. Grace scored 170 in the Oval Test of 1886, beating the individual Test innings record of 164 set by Arthur Shrewsbury in the previous match on an evil pitch at Lords. England won by an innings on the third day after Australia were bowled out for 68 and 149m with George Lohmann of Surrey taking 12 for 104. The Australian tourists, without Bannerman or Murdoch and often losing Spofforth to injuries, lost all three Tests.\nShrewsbury's England beat Australia in both matches on the 1886–87 tour, despite being bowled out for 45 on the first day at Sydney. Two England parties toured there in 1887–88, with Shaw and Shrewsbury's team sponsored by Melbourne CC and Lord Harris's team by the Sydney Association. The two sides joined up for one Test Match at Sydney which they won thanks to Lohmann's 9 wickets and Bobby Peel's 10. Australia made just 42 and 82 on a poor pitch in bad light.\nThe 1888 Australians won at Lords but lost at The Oval and Old Trafford. Their bowling was penetrative, particularly Jack Ferris and the 'terror' Charlie Turner, but their batting was too weak to withstand the English professionals in their home conditions. Bobby Peel took 11 wickets at Old Trafford. \nEngland won the first Test in South Africa, at Port Elizabeth in March 1889 by 8 wickets, despite fielding a less than first choice XI. W.H. Ashley took 7 for 95 for South Africa in his only Test. Bobby Abel of Surrey scored 120 for England in the Second Test, the first hundred scored in South Africa. Bernard Tancred of South Africa became the first Test batsman to carry his bat, for 26*, as South Africa collapsed to 47 all out. M.P. Bowden remains the youngest man to captain England, at just 23 years and 144 days. Johnny Briggs took 7 for 17 and 8 for 11 at Cape Town, 14 bowled and 1 LBW.\n1890s.\nFour ball overs gave way to five ball overs in the 1890s and to six ball overs in Australia, as the game continued to develop quickly. England won the 1890 Ashes series 2–0, although Jack Barrett carried his bat for 67 through Australia's second innings of 176 at Lord's. W. G. Grace was out second ball in the first innings but saw England home in the second with 75*. Frederick Martin took 12 Australian wickets for 102 but 'Nutty' never played an Ashes match again. The third scheduled match, at Old Trafford, was the first Test to be abandoned without a ball being bowled.\nW. G. Grace's tourists lost 2–1 on the 1891–92 tour, Australia winning at Melbourne and Sydney, where Bannerman batted for seven and a half hours and scored only three boundaries and England's Bobby Abel carried his bat for 132. England claimed a consolation innings victory at Adelaide where Stoddard scored 134 and Peel 83 and Briggs took 6 wickets in each innings.\nEngland won the only Test on the 1891/92 tour of South Africa at Cape Town, where Harry Wood, the Surrey wicket keeper made 134 not out and Ferris, who had earlier played for Australia, took 13 for 91. Billy Murdoch was another Australian turned Englishman on the tour.\nEngland regained the Ashes in 1893, with an innings win at The Oval and draws in the other two Tests. W. G. Grace and A.E. Stoddart made three consecutive century opening stands. William Gunn of Nottinghamshire scored his only Test hundred, 102*, at Old Trafford, while Arthur Shrewsbury scored 106 at Lord's. Future England great Ranjitsinhji was one of the unfortunate bowlers as Australia set a new record team score of 843 against 'Oxford and Cambridge Past and Present' in Portsmouth.\nAndrew Stoddart led England to a thrilling 3–2 victory on the 1894–1895 Ashes tour. Bobby Peel took the final wickets in the first Test victory at Sydney and the second at Melbourne and hit the winning runs in the final and deciding Test at the MCG. England's amazing victory at Sydney, by 10 runs, came after they had followed on with Lancashire's Albert Ward hitting 75 and 117 in the game. J.T. Brown scored 140 for England at Melbourne where England were set 297 to win. He reached 50 in 28 minutes and put on a then record 210 with Ward as England won by six wickets. Tom Richardson took 32 wickets in the Tests.\nEngland won all three Tests of the 1895/96 tour of South Africa by resounding margins. Lohmann was unplayable, taking 7 for 38 and 8 for 7 at Port Elizabeth and finishing with a hat trick. He took 9 for 28 and 3 for 43 at Johannesburg and 7 for 42 and 1 for 45 at Cape Town.\nHaving been overlooked for the first Test at Lord's, where Australian captain Harry Trott scored 143 and put on a record 210 with Syd Gregory (103), Shri Ranjitsinhji burst into Test cricket with 62 and 154 at Old Trafford in 1896. His magical batting and Tom Richardson's 13 for 244 were not enough to prevent Australia running out winners by 3 wickets however. Five English professionals went on 'strike' for more money before the Oval Test. Abel, Hayward and Richardson relented, but Gunn and Lohmann never played for England again. England won the series 2–1.\nThe Ashes were lost on Andrew Stoddart's 1897/98 tour, with Australia thumping England 4–1. Australian Joe Darling was the first batsmen to make 500 runs in a Test series, including 101 at Sydney, 178 at Adelaide and 160 in the final Sydney Test, where his hundred came up in 91 minutes. Stoddart's mother died just before the first Test and he was too distraught to play in either of the first two matches. Ranji, batting at number 7 after a throat infection, scored a brilliant 175 in the first Test and took England over 500 for the first time in a game won by 9 wickets but the Englishmen lost the next four heavily.\nLord Hawke's tourists in 1898/99 played and won two Tests in South Africa, with sometime Australian Albert Trott taking 17 wickets. Plum Warner carried his bat for 132 at Johannesburg in his maiden Test.\nThe 1899 series against Australia saw two significant developments. For the first time in England, five Tests were played rather than three, with Trent Bridge and Headingley being added to the \"traditional\" venues of Lord's, The Oval and Old Trafford. Also MCC and the counties appointed a selection committee for the first time. It comprised three active players: Lord Hawke, W.G. Grace and H.W. Bainbridge who was the captain of Warwickshire. Prior to this, England teams for home Tests had been chosen by the club on whose ground the match was to be played. The peerless Australian Victor Trumper dominated the series. He scored 1,500 runs on the tour, including 300 not out against Sussex and a breathtaking century in Australia's sole, but deciding, Test victory at Lords. W.G. Grace played his last Test at Trent Bridge. F.S. Jackson and Tom Hayward put on 185 at the Oval for the first wicket. England, scoring 576, forced Australia (352) to follow on, but the Australians played out the draw and with it retained the Ashes.\n1900–1914: The \"Golden Age\".\nThe first Test series of the new century took place in Australia 1901–1902 and was won by Australia who came from one down to take the series 4–1. The England side was a private venture of Archie MacLaren (although the matches were all official Test matches). It was rather an attritional series of matches with only three centuries being scored and only one team innings over 400 (the first innings of England in the First Test at the SCG). Sydney Barnes made his debut for England and took 19 wickets in the first two Tests before being injured in the third and talking no further part in the series.\nThere was a home series against Australia in 1902 which was won by the Australians (2–1). In the drawn First Test at Edgbaston Australia were dismissed for 36 in their first innings (Wilfred Rhodes 7 for 17) but rain meant that the match was drawn. Rain also ruined the following match at Lord's. Sydney Barnes returned to the England team and had immediate success, taking seven wickets in the third Test at Sheffield (the only Test ever to be played there). However England still lost the match. The final two Tests were amongst the most exciting of all time. A brilliant century by Trumper helped Australia to win the match at Old Trafford by three runs. England's batting throughout the series was modest with only one innings of over 300 and with only three centuries scored. The last of these was a match-winning innings in the final Test at The Oval by Gilbert Jessop, who went in at number seven in the second innings with England 48–5 and scored what was then the fastest century in Test cricket in 70 minutes, setting up an improbable England win by one wicket. The last wicket pair of Wilfred Rhodes and George Hirst nervelessly acquired the final fifteen runs needed for victory.\nEngland toured Australia in 1903–1904, the first time that the MCC had been responsible for an England tour overseas. England regained The Ashes with a 3–2 series win under the captaincy of Plum Warner. In the first Test R.E.Foster made his Test debut and scored 287 in his first ever innings – the then highest ever Test score and a record that was to stand for a quarter of a century. Wilfred Rhodes took 15 wickets in England's second Test win at the MCG –a record that was to stand for thirty years. In the fifth Test England were dismissed for 61 in their first innings on a rain-affected pitch.\nIn 1905 Australia toured England and were beaten 2–0 with three matches drawn. Notable batting performances in the series included centuries by A.C. MacLaren, F.S. Jackson (2), Johnny Tyldesley (2) and C.B. Fry. B.J.T. Bosanquet, the inventor of the googly, took eight wickets in an Innings in the First Test.\nIn 1905–06 Plum Warner took an MCC team to South Africa for the first time and England were soundly beaten 4–1 in the series. England's batting faltered throughout the series with only one team innings in excess of 200 (successive innings of 184,190,148,160,295,196,198,160,187 and 130) and just one individual century (by F.L.Fane in the 3rd Test at the Wanderers). England's only win came at Newlands where the left-arm slow bowler Colin Blythe took eleven wickets in the match.\nIn 1907 there was a home three match Test series against South Africa which England, captained by R.E.Foster, won 1–0. Highlights included another sparkling innings by Gilbert Jessop who scored 93 at Lord's in a partnership of 145 for the sixth wicket with Len Braund who scored a century. There was another fine bowling performance by Blythe, who took 15 wickets at Headingley on a rain-affected match in a match that England won despite having been bowled out for 76 in their first innings.\nIn England's Test series in Australia in 1907–08 Australia won the first Test but England hit back well with a narrow win at the MCG in the 2nd Test in which Jack Hobbs made his England debut scoring 83 and 28. England were outplayed by Australia in the next three Tests and lost the series and the Ashes 4–1. England's batting was fragile throughout the series with only Gunn (2) and Hutchings scoring hundreds. The bowling relied on Jack Crawford), Arthur Fielder and Barnes, who took 79 wickets between them.\nIn a home series against Australia in 1909 England lost 2–1 (two draws) and no combination of players (England used 25 in total in the series) seemed to work. England failed to make 200 in an innings five times and there was only one individual century (by J. Sharp in the 3rd Test). The remarkable Colin Blythe delivered England's only victory by taking eleven wickets in the First Test at Edgbaston, but thereafter Australia, whilst never dominating the England attack, always had the edge. \nEngland returned to South Africa in 1909–10 under H.D.G. Leveson-Gower, for a five match Test series and fared little better than on their first visit in 1905–06. The series was lost 3–2 but this disguises South Africa's superiority. The main highlight was Jack Hobbs first (of 15) Test century in the final Test at Newlands, he put on a then record 211 for the first wicket with Wilfred Rhodes. This was one of only two personal hundreds by England batsmen in the series. The bowling attack was weak – although the last of the great \"lob\" (underhand) bowlers George Simpson-Hayward had field days in the first three Test matches when he took a total of 21 wickets. Colin Blythe bowled England to a consolation win in the fifth Test with ten wickets in the match. Legspin dominated on the matting pitches, with the ball often bouncing chest high. Vogler took 29 wickets for the home side and Faulkner 29.\nEngland toured Australia in 1911/12 under Plum Warner, but Johnny Douglas took over the captaincy when Warner fell ill prior to the first Test. Despite losing that first match at Sydney, a side which boasted Jack Hobbs, Frank Woolley, Sydney Barnes and Wilfred Rhodes hit back to take the next four Tests in style. Frank Foster and Barnes dominated with the ball, sharing 66 wickets, while Hobbs, Rhodes and Woolley recorded centuries. Hobbs and Rhodes shared opening stands of 147 at Adelaide and a then record 323 at Melbourne in the next Test where Barnes dismissed Bardsley, Kelleway, Hill and Armstrong for 3 runs in his opening spell. Later in the game, when the crowd barracked Barnes for deliberating over a field setting, he threw the ball down in disgust and refused to continue until order was restored. Frank Woolley also hit 305* in 205 minutes in a tour game against Tasmania.\nThe 1912 home season saw a unique experiment with a 9 Test triangular tournament involving South Africa and Australia but it was an idea ahead of its time and was not repeated. C.B. Fry of Sussex captained the team against Syd Gregory of Australia and Frank Mitchell of South Africa. Jack Hobbs scored 107 against Australia at Lords in a rain ruined game. The Australia v South Africa match, at Lord's, was notable for a visit by King George V, the first time a reigning monarch had watched Test cricket. Barnes took 34 wickets in his 3 Tests against the South Africans.\nEngland's 1913/14 tour of South Africa was the last before the onset of World War I, and England dominated the rubber, winning 4–0. Syd Barnes was once again unplayable, taking 49 wickets in four Tests before boycotting the last in a row over his wife's accommodation. Only Herbie Taylor resisted for the home side, with skilful backfoot defence on the matting pitches, scoring 508 runs at 50.8.\n1920s.\nEngland resumed their Test cricket after World War I with a tour of Australia in 1920/21 under Johnny Douglas. After the ravages of the war it was little surprise when England went down to a series of crushing defeats, the first 5–0 whitewash. Six Australians scored hundreds while Mailey spun out 36 English batsmen. Things were no better when Warwick Armstrong's men toured England in 1921. Australian fast bowlers Gregory and McDonald battered the English batsmen with a succession of bouncers and Jack Hobbs missed most of the season with first a leg injury then appendicitis. England used 30 players in all. Only one Australian made a century as opposed to 3 for England – A. C. \"Jack\" Russell scoring 101 and 102* and Phil Mead 182* – but Australia's 3–0 victory made it 8 Ashes defeats in succession.\nEngland resumed the winning habit on the 1922/23 tour of South Africa, under F.T. Mann, winning a pulsating rubber 2 – 1. England lost the first Test but scraped to victory in the next, at Cape Town, by one wicket. Phil Mead scored 181 at Kingsmead, Durban, to ensure a draw and they won the fifth and final match, also at Durban, thanks to Jack Russell's twin centuries in his final Test. This dominance was underlined in England in 1924 with a 3–0 for England.\nHopes that the Ashes might be regained were dashed on the 1924/25 tour down under however, Australia thrashing England 4–1, although England scored 8 centuries to Australia's 6. Herbert Sutcliffe scored 734 runs at 81.56 and Maurice Tate broke Mailey's Ashes record with 38 wickets, bowling 2,528 balls in the Tests. England's only victory came at Melbourne, by an innings, after Captain Arthur Gilligan won the toss for the only time. It was England's first Ashes Test win in 12 years.\nEngland drew the first four Tests of the 1926 Ashes series and so the series rested on the Oval Test, for which Percy Chapman replaced Arthur Carr as captain and both the 48-year-old Rhodes and 21-year-old Larwood were selected. Hobbs and Sutcliffe scored centuries and Australia lost by 289 runs. The South African team proved stronger than before however and drew the 1927/28 series 2–2.\nA fourth team was, at last, introduced to Test cricket when the West Indies took their bow in 1928. England won each of the three Tests by an innings, Freeman taking 22 wickets, and a view was expressed in the press that their elevation had proved a mistake although 'electric heels' Learie Constantine did the double on the tour. The England team at this period was as strong as it has ever been and Australia were dispatched 4–1 on the 1928/29 Ashes tour. Hammond scored 44, 28, 251, 200, 32, 119*, 177, 38 and 16 – a total of 905 runs, a new record. Percy Chapman captained the team but barely played again.\nEngland, under J. C. White and Arthur Carr, beat South Africa 2–0 at home in 1929 with Herbert Sutcliffe scoring a hundred in each innings at the Oval Bizarrely there were two concurrent England tours in 1929/30, one to New Zealand and one to the West Indies. Surrey paceman Maurice Allom took four wickets in five balls in New Zealand's maiden Test match, including a hat trick, and his 8 for 65 swept England to victory in Christchurch by 8 wickets with the three later Tests drawn. At the same time another England team were drawing 1–1 in the West Indies under F. S. G. Calthorpe. Forty-year-old Patsy Hendren made 1,765 runs on this tour and Andy Sandham scored 325 at Kingston (out of England's 849) in his final Test. The 'black Bradman' George Headley followed twin centuries at Georgetown with 223 in the same Kingston game.\n1930s.\nThe 21-year-old Don Bradman dominated the 1930 Ashes series in England, scoring 974 runs in his seven Test innings. He scored 254 at Lord's, 334 at Headingley, when Chapman stuck to attacking fields all day, and 232 at the Oval. Australia regained the Ashes. Harold Larwood took only four wickets in the series although K. S. Duleepsinhji made 173 at Lord's on debut.\nEngland played five Tests in South Africa on the 1930/31 tour. Chasing 240 to win the first Test at the Old Wanderers ground in Johannesburg they were bowled out by E. P. Nupen, a master on the matting wicket, and drew the next four.\nNew Zealand played their first Test in England in 1931 and their strong performance at Lord's led the authorities to arrange another two that summer, one of which England won. India played their first Test in England in 1932 at Lords, reducing England to 19 for 3 on the first morning before losing a competitive match when they were bowled out for 187 chasing 346.\nBefore the 1932–3 tour to Australia, England had become used to the prolific run-scoring of Don Bradman. The England captain, Surrey's Douglas Jardine chose to develop the already existing leg theory into fast leg theory, or bodyline, as a tactic to stop Bradman. Fast leg theory involved bowling fast balls directly at the batsman's body, and Jardine had two very fast accurate bowlers, Harold Larwood and Bill Voce to bowl them. The batsman would need to defend himself, and if he touched the ball with the bat, he risked being caught by one of a large number of fielders placed on the leg side. \nEngland won the series and the Ashes 4–1. But complaints about the Bodyline tactic caused crowd disruption on the tour, and threats of diplomatic action from the Australian Cricket Board, which during the tour sent the following cable to the Marylebone Cricket Club in London:\nLater, Jardine was removed from the captaincy and the laws of cricket changed so that no more than one fast ball aimed at the body was permitted per over, and having more than two fielders behind square leg were banned.\nEngland won two Tests on the 1933/34 tour of India, the first ever Tests held in the sub continent. England won by nine wickets at Bombay's Gymkhana ground with Bryan Valentine scoring 136 in his first Test innings. Morris Nichols and E. W. \"Nobby\" Clark bowled so many bouncers at the Indian batsman that they wore solar topees instead of caps to protect themselves from the ball as much as the sun. Naoomal Jeoomal top edged a Clark bouncer into his head in the third Test, was unable to continue and didn't bat in the second innings.\nAustralia won the first Test of the 1934 Ashes series by 238 runs at Trent Bridge. Clarrie Grimmett took 25 wickets in the series, and Bill O'Reilly 28 as England were spun to defeat. Bradman made 758 runs in the Tests and 2020 on the tour, with Stan McCabe making 2078. Patsy Hendren(132) and Maurice Leyland (153) ensured a draw at Old Trafford and England did manage a rare Test win over Australia at Lord's with Hedley Verity taking 14 wickets in a day and 15 in the match. Bradman (304) and Ponsford (181) put on 388 at Headingley and then 451 at the Oval where England lost by a massive 562 runs. Ponsford scored 266 in his last Test. Nobby Clark bowled some 'leg theory' against the Australians, with little success. Bill Voce took 8 for 66 for Notts against the Australians but withdrew from the attack with a 'leg injury' after Woodfall raised discrete objections.\nEngland toured the West Indies in 1934/5 and showed the folly of sending a weakened team as they lost the rubber 2–1 with George Headley scoring 270 not out in the 4th Test at Sabina Park. South Africa won on English soil for the first time, taking the 5 Test series 1–0 in 1935 with a victory at Lord's by 157 runs thanks to Bruce Mitchell's 164 and Jock Cameron's quickfire 90. Cameron died at 30, of enteric fever, soon after returning home from this tour.\nIndia used 22 players in three Tests in England in 1936. A then record 588 runs were scored on the second day of the Old Trafford Test and England too experimented with their team and took the rubber 2–0.\nThe 1936/37 Ashes tour, under Gubby Allen, was a titanic struggle. England, helped by rain freshening the pitch, won by 322 runs in Brisbane and an innings in Sydney where Wally Hammond scored 271 not out. Bill Voce was their spearhead, taking 17 wickets in these two games. Bradman added a record 346 for the sixth wicket with Jack Fingleton at Melbourne and followed that with 212 at Adelaide where his team leveled the score at 2–2. Bradman, McCabe and Badcock all scored hundreds in the decider at Melbourne and Australian took the series 3–2.\nEngland beat New Zealand 1–0 in a three Test rubber in 1937. Tom Goddard took 6 for 29 in bowling out the visitors for 134 at the Old Trafford Test as they chased 265 to win. Jack Cowie had taken 6 for 67 for New Zealand and 10 in the match. Len Hutton scored a century after having begun his England career with 0 and 1 at Lords. Prospective tours of South Africa and West Indies fell through in the winter of 1937/38.\nThe 1938 Ashes series was a high scoring affair. Hutton, Barnett, Paynter (216*) and Compton made hundreds at Trent Bridge with the Australians scoring three including Stan McCabe's brilliant 232. Hammond scored 240 in the Lord's Test while Bill Brown made a double ton and Bradman a match saving century for Australia. Old Trafford fell victim to the rain and Australia retained the Ashes with a win at Headingley, thanks to Bradman's century and 10 wickets for O'Reilly and 7 for Fleetwood-Smith. England won the final Test at the Oval thanks to a record Test score of 903 – 7 dec and Len Hutton's world record of 364 in 13 hours, 17 minutes. Bradman, whose score of 334 had been surpassed, was the first to congratulate the 22-year-old Yorkshireman. Maurice Leyland made 187 and the elegant Joe Hardstaff 169 not out. Australia subsided to 201 and 123, batting 2 short, and England won by an innings and 579.\nPaul Gibb scored 93 and 106 on debut at Johannesburg on England's 1938/39 tour. England scored 11 centuries in the series and South Africa 6. Paynter scored 117 and 100 in the first Test and 243 in the third at Durban. England, 1–0, in the series, returned to Durban to play a deciding 'timeless' Test to the finish. It was abandoned as a draw after 10 days as England had to catch the train to catch the boat home. Needing 696 to win they were, incredibly, 654 for 5, Gibb having scored 120, Hammond 140 and Edrich 219. A record 1981 runs were scored, and the concept of timeless Tests was abandoned.\nThe three Tests between England and the West Indies in 1939 were the last before the Second World War, although a team for an MCC tour of India was selected more in hope than expectation of the matches being played. Len Hutton and Denis Compton, leaders of the bright new batting generation, scored hundreds at Lords where the brilliant George Headley scored a ton in each innings. Hammond became the first fielder to hold 100 Test catches at Old Trafford. England took the series 1–0 as the war clouds loomed over Europe."

        "text": "The Philadelphian cricket team toured England in the summer of 1897. Starting on 7 June at Oxford, the tour lasted for two months and ended in late July at The Oval. The Americans played 15 first-class matches captained by George Stuart Patterson.\nThe match the Philadelphians played against the MCC was to be Patterson's last first-class cricket match. The tour introduced American bowler J Barton King to the international cricketing world.\nTour results.\nThis tour was a very ambitious one for the Americans. They had last toured the British Isles in 1889. Though the results may have been less satisfactory than hoped for by promoters, the tour was arranged mainly for educational purposes and few of those on the American side expected to win many matches. Previous tours had tended to involve amateur English sides with a relatively low level of competition. In 1897 a schedule was made including all of the top county cricket teams, the Oxford and Cambridge University teams, the Marylebone Cricket Club, and two other sides, though only a few of the counties thought it worthwhile to put their best elevens onto the field. While it initially aroused some curiosity, many English fans lost interest until Bart King and the Philadelphians met the full Sussex team at Brighton on 17 June. In the first innings, King proved his batting worth on a fourth-wicket stand of 107 runs with John Lester. He then took 7 wickets for 13 runs and the team dismissed Sussex for 46 in less than an hour. In the second innings, King took 6 for 102 and helped the Philadelphians to a victory by 8 wickets.\nDespite the excitement surrounding King's performance, the Americans did not fare well overall. Fifteen matches were played, but only two were won while the team lost nine and earned a draw on four. The other win of the tour came against Warwickshire. During this match King again shined by taking 5 for 95 and 7 for 72 and scoring 46 runs. According to the \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" King proved himself to be the best bowler on the American side and had to do much of the work. He bowled three hundred overs more than anyone else. His average was just over 24 runs each for 72 wickets. In addition to his work bowling, King scored 441 runs with an average of just over 20. Captain George Patterson's best innings batting was 162 runs at Trent Bridge against Nottinghamshire.\nControversy.\nHaving returned home from the tour, there were claims in the \"Philadelphia Public Ledger\" that the Philadelphians had been treated unfairly by the English umpires, but Patterson put those rumors to rest with a letter to the editor of an American newspaper:\nMy attention has been directed to a letter signed W.S. in the \"Field\" of July 24th, enclosing a clipping from the \"Philadelphia Public Ledger\", severely criticising the umpiring in the Philadelphian matches during our tour through England. I wish to state on behalf of the Philadelphia team that the sentiments expressed in the clipping are not those of the team, and that we emphatically repudiate any insinuation of unfair treatment. On the contrary, we have been received with the most unvarying courtesy and fairness both on and off the field. I wish to take this opportunity of making a public acknowledgement of our indebtedness to Mr. Perkins, of the M.C.C., for the umpires assigned to us, and to testify, unnecessary though it be, to their ability and integrity.\nThe calming words from Patterson on the issue seem to have defused the situation in Philadelphia."

Christl, who earned a posthumous Distinguished Service Cross during World War II and for whom the Black Knights' home arena is named.\nHead coach Bob Knight turned down the 1968 NCAA tournament invitation in favor of the NIT, because he believed the Black Knights had a better chance of winning the NIT with Lew Alcindor and UCLA playing in the NCAA tournament.

He attended Tulane University, where he played football and baseball. Harris accepted a scholarship to play football for the Tulane Green Wave with the expectation that he would also play on the baseball team. However, due to a change in coaching staffs, he was only allowed to play one season of college baseball.\nCareer.\nHarris was a fifth-round draft pick of the Montreal Expos in 1986.\nHe made it to the majors with Montreal to start the 1989 season but was sent down to Triple-A in early May. Later that month, he became part of a trade that the Expos would rue. They gave up future 300-game winner Randy Johnson along with Brian Holman and Harris to the Seattle Mariners for Mark Langston and a player to be named later. Langston left as a free agent after the season.\nHarris was up and down between the Mariners and Triple-A during his time in the Seattle organization. In May 1992, he left the Mariners to attend his stepfather's funeral and did not return to the team when scheduled.

Harris ultimately spent just two weeks away from baseball, after which he was traded to the San Diego Padres.\nHarris enjoyed the best year of his career in 1993, posting 23 saves for the Padres.\nDuring the 1994 season, an injured and ineffective Harris lost his closer role with the Padres to Trevor Hoffman in mid-April. He was traded in May to the Detroit Tigers, for whom he pitched only 11 1/3 innings.\nHarris signed as a free agent with the Philadelphia Phillies ahead of the 1995 season but was traded to the Baltimore Orioles in June. He made just three appearances for Baltimore before being sidelined with an injured elbow. He and underwent season-ending elbow surgery in August.

He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball from 1970 to 1983 for the Los Angeles Dodgers, St. Louis Cardinals, Houston Astros, and the California Angels. After his playing career, Ferguson became a coach and minor league manager.\nCareer.\nPrior to his professional baseball career, Ferguson played baseball but also basketball at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, CA. In fact, he played in the West Regional Final in March 1967, where Pacific fell to eventual National champion UCLA, led by sophomore Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\nFerguson reached the majors in 1970 with the Los Angeles Dodgers, becoming their everyday catcher in 1973. He set a major league record for catchers by committing only three errors, leading the National League catchers in fielding percentage (.996) and double plays (17), while hitting .263 with a .369 on-base percentage. He also reached career-highs in games played (136), home runs (25), RBI (88), runs (84), doubles (26) and walks (87).\nWhen Steve Yeager became a regular behind the plate midseason in 1973, Ferguson split his catching duties with playing right field against left-handed pitchers. He soon became known for having one of the strongest throwing arms of any outfielder in the major leagues. In Game One of the 1974 World Series he stepped in front of center fielder Jimmy Wynn in deep right-center field to catch Reggie Jackson's high fly ball and proceeded to throw a 300-foot strike to catcher Yeager who tagged out Sal Bando in a collision at home plate to end the top of the eighth inning. He explained after the game that Wynn had been bothered by a shoulder problem in his throwing arm all season long and added, \"There was never any worry about a collision between us. We talked about it earlier in the game that if such a flyball like that was hit with a guy on third base that if I could get there I'd take it. I'd make the throw. I didn't realize how good the throw was because my sunglasses slipped over my eyes.\" In Game Two, Ferguson hit a two-run homer off Vida Blue to provide the only Dodgers' victory in the Series. He enjoyed another fine season in 1977 with Houston, catching 122 games and hitting 16 home runs with 61 RBI and a .379 OBP. Reacquired by the Dodgers in the 1978 midseason, he helped his team reach the 1978 World Series.\nAfter retiring, he coached at the major league level with the Texas Rangers (1986–87), working under former Dodger teammate Bobby Valentine, and the Dodgers (1988–94). He also managed in the Dodgers, Baltimore Orioles and San Diego Padres minor league systems. He managed the Camden Riversharks Atlantic League baseball team in New Jersey for 3 seasons from 2007 - 2009.\nIn a 14-season career, Ferguson was a power-hitter who was very efficient at getting on base. Although he only had a .240 batting average, he had a .358 on-base percentage to go along with 122 home runs and 445 RBI in 1013 games. In 13 postseason games he batted .200, but had an excellent .378 on-base percentage to go along with 1 HR and 4 RBI's."

        "text": "The 1909 Giro d'Italia was the 1st edition of the Giro d'Italia, organized and sponsored by the italian major sport newspaper \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\". The event began in Milan on 13 May with a first stage to Bologna, finishing back in Milan on 30 May after a final stage of and a total distance covered of . The race was won by the Italian rider Luigi Ganna of the Atala team, with fellow Italians Carlo Galetti and Giovanni Rossignoli coming in second and third respectively.\nConceived by \"La Gazzetta\" to boost its circulation at the expense of its rival \"Corriere della Sera\", the 1909 Giro was the first stage road race. Its eight stages, although relatively few compared to modern Grand Tours, were each much longer than those raced today. The event began with a long primarily flat stage that was won by Dario Beni. He lost the lead after the next stage to the eventual winner Luigi Ganna, who in turn lost it to Carlo Galetti after the mountainous third stage. Ganna regained the lead after the fourth stage and successfully defended it all the way to the finish in Milan, winning three stages en route. Atala won the team classification.\nOrigin.\nThe idea of holding a bicycle race around Italy was first suggested in a telegram sent by Tullo Margagni, editor of \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\", to the paper's owner Emilio Costamagna and cycling editor Armando Cougnet. \"La Gazzetta\"'s rival, \"Corriere della Sera\" was planning to hold a bicycle race of its own, flushed with the success of its automobile race. Morgagni decided to try and hold the race before \"Corriere della Sera\" could hold theirs, and following \"La Gazzetta\"s success in creating the Giro di Lombardia and Milan–San Remo, Costamagna decided to back the idea. The inaugural Giro d'Italia bicycle race was announced on 7 August 1908 in the first page of that day's edition of \"La Gazzetta\", to be held in May 1909. The idea of the race was influenced by the success of the French magazine \"L'Auto\"s organization of the Tour de France.\nSince the newspaper lacked the necessary 25,000 lire to sponsor the race, the organizers consulted Primo Bongrani, a sympathetic accountant at the bank Cassa di Risparmio. He proceeded to solicit donations from all over Italy, and succeeded in raising sufficient money to cover the operating costs. The prize money came from a casino in San Remo after Francesco Sghirla, a former \"Gazzetta\" employee, encouraged them to contribute to the race. Even \"Corriere\", \"La Gazzetta\"'s rival, donated 3,000 lire.\nRules and course.\nBoth teams and individual riders were allowed to enter the race, which was run in eight stages with two to three rest days between each stage. Compared to modern races the stages were extraordinarily long, with an average distance of more than , compared to the average stage length in the 2012 Giro d'Italia.\nThe route was primarily flat, although it did contain a few major ascents. The third stage contained ascents to Macerone, Rionero Sannitico, and Roccaraso. The Giro's sixth stage contained only one pass, the Passo Bracco. The seventh stage was the last to contain any major ascents: the climbs of the Colle di Nava and the ascent to San Bartolomeo.\nRiders were required to sign in at checkpoints during each stage to minimize the opportunities for cheating; they were also photographed at the beginning and end of each stage, and the images compared by the judges. Riders could receive assistance when repairing their bicycles, but were not allowed to replace their machines if they became damaged during the course of the stage.\nThe inaugural Giro used a points system to determine the race winner. The organizers chose to have a points system over a system based around elapsed time after the scandal that engulfed the 1904 Tour de France. Another factor in the organizer's decision was that it would be cheaper to count the placings of the riders rather than clocking their times during each stage. The race leader was determined by adding up each rider's placing in each stage. Thus if a rider placed second in the first stage and third in the second stage he would have a total of five points, and whoever had the lowest points total was the leader. Under this system Luigi Ganna was declared the winner, but had the Giro been a time-based event he would have lost to the third-place finisher Giovanni Rossignoli by 37 minutes.\nThe winner of the general classification received a grand prize of 5,325 lire. Every rider who finished the race with more than 100 points without winning any prizes in any of the stages was given 100 lire.\nParticipants.\nA total of 166 riders signed up to participate in the event. Twenty of the riders who entered were non-Italians: fifteen were French, two were German, one was Argentinian, one was Belgian, and one was from Trieste, which at the time was not a part of Italy. Only 127 riders started the first stage of the race, all but five of Italian descent, of whom only 49 reached the finish in Milan on 30 May. Riders were allowed to enter the race as independents or as a member of a team.\nThe two best-known Italians taking part in the race were Luigi Ganna and Giovanni Gerbi. Gerbi was the more successful of the two, having won the Giro di Lombardia, the Milano–Torino, and several other one-day races. Ganna had won Milan–San Remo earlier the same year – notably the first Italian winner of the race. The peloton also featured two Tour de France winners, Louis Trousselier and Lucien Petit-Breton, as well as two future Giro d'Italia winners: Carlo Galetti and Carlo Oriani.\nRace overview.\nThe inaugural Giro d'Italia's first stage, from Milan to Bologna, began on 13 May 1909 at 2:53 am in front of a large crowd. 127 riders set off from the starting line outside \"La Gazzetta\"s headquarters in the Piazzale Loreto. The stage was marred by mechanical issues and crashes owing to bad weather, the first mass crash occurring before dawn less than from the start. Luigi Ganna, leading after the first real climb near Lake Garda, was delayed by a puncture with about to go and the other racers attacked, but he caught them again after they were stopped by a train crossing. The leading riders then made their way into Bologna, where Dario Beni won the stage. The second stage, long, saw the first uphill finish, into Chieti, where Giovanni Cuniolo edged out Ganna for the stage win. Ganna's second place was nevertheless high enough to make him the new race leader.\nThe third stage, to Naples, was . Before the start, three riders were disqualified and subsequently removed from the race for taking a train during the second stage. They were caught after failing to pass through an unexpected checkpoint set up by the organizers. The start of the third stage was moved downhill after the opening descent was found to be too dangerous for the participants' brakes. The stage featured three major climbs. After the mountains Giovanni Rossignoli pursued the leader, Carlo Galetti, eventually catching him and going on to win the stage, while Galetti took the race lead away from Ganna. On the fourth stage, from Naples to the Italian capital Rome, French rider Louis Trousselier was doing well until he ran over tacks strewn on the road by spectators, and the other riders left him behind. Galetti and Ganna formed a group at the front and Ganna went on to win the stage in front of thousands of spectators, retaking the race lead by a single point.\nThe fifth stage was to Florence. Like the fourth, it was plagued by punctures. Luigi Ganna led until he had a flat tyre with about to go. A few riders passed him as he repaired it but he chased them down and won the stage. On the sixth stage, from Florence to Genoa, Carlo Galetti and Giovanni Rossignoli broke away from the leading group of seven as they neared the downhill finish, with Rossignoli winning the stage in front of a large crowd. Race leader Ganna had suffered more punctures but managed to fight his way back to finish third.\nThe seventh stage, , was scheduled to run from Genoa to Turin. Massive crowds at the start led Armando Cougnet to introduce a rule forbidding riders to attack over the first few kilometers until the peloton was outside the city and the race proper could begin. There was also rumored to be close to 50,000 spectators and a bakers' strike in Turin, so Cougnet switched the finish to the city of Beinasco, about short of Turin. Ganna and Rossignoli led for most of the stage until about before the finish, when Ganna attacked and Rossignoli could not counter. Ganna's win extended his race lead over Carlo Galetti.\nThe eighth and final stage started in Turin, covered , and finished in Milan in front of a crowd of more than 30,000. Ganna was amongst the leading group until he suffered a flat tyre. He managed to fight his way back until, with the leaders in sight, he had another puncture. The leading group pulled away until the race directors stopped them to let Ganna catch up. Escorted by mounted police, the riders then made their way into Milan's Arena Civica stadium for the finish. As the racers geared up for the sprint finish a police horse fell, causing a few riders to crash. Dario Beni avoided the incident and edged out Galetti for the stage win, with Ganna coming in third. Thus Ganna became the first winner of the Giro d'Italia. He and his team, Atala, also won the team classification.\nResults.\nGeneral classification.\nForty-nine cyclists completed all eight stages. The points each received from their stage placings were added up for the general classification, and the winner was the rider with the fewest accumulated points. Ernesto Azzini won the prize for best ranked isolati rider in the general classification.\nAftermath.\nThe first Giro d'Italia was a great success, prompting organizers to arrange a second one for 1910. The race substantially increased \"La Gazzetta\"'s circulation, and the starts and finishes were attended by large audiences. Ganna's prize money helped him start his own bike factory in 1912. The newspaper ran the event through 1988, when the RCS Organizzazzioni Sportivi company was created to run it."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball annual ERA leaders",
        "text": "In baseball, earned run average (ERA) is a statistic used to evaluate pitchers, calculated as the mean of earned runs given up by a pitcher per nine innings pitched. A pitcher is men by a baserunner who reached base while batting against that pitcher, whether by hit, base on balls or \"walk\", or being hit by a pitched ball; an earned run can be charged after the pitcher is relieved if he allows the runner before leaving the game. Runs scored by players who reach base on errors, passed balls, or catcher interference under special circumstances are treated as unearned runs, and do not count towards the pitcher's ERA.\nMajor League Baseball recognizes the player in each league with the lowest earned run average each season. The first ERA champion in the National League was George Bradley; in the National League's inaugural 1876 season, Bradley posted a 1.23 ERA for the St. Louis Brown Stockings, allowing 78 earned runs in 573 innings pitched. The American League was established in 1901, and Hall of Fame pitcher Cy Young led that league with a 1.62 ERA for the Boston Americans during the 1901 season.\nOver the course of his 17-year major league career, Lefty Grove led the American League in ERA nine times, with a career single-season low of 2.06 for the 1931 Philadelphia Athletics. Roger Clemens has won the second-most ERA titles, capturing six in the American League and one in the National League. Sandy Koufax led the National League in ERA for five consecutive seasons (1962–1966); Koufax' five awards are the most won consecutively by any player and are tied for the most awards by a player in the National League with Christy Mathewson and Clayton Kershaw. In the American League, Walter Johnson also won five ERA titles, and Pedro Martínez has won a total of five (four American League and one National League) with two different teams.\nThe most recent ERA champions are Gerrit Cole in the American League and Blake Snell in the National League.\nThe lowest single-season ERA in league history was posted by Tim Keefe, whose 0.86 ERA in 105 innings pitched for the National League's Troy Trojans in 1880 led his closest competitor by .52 runs. In the American League, Dutch Leonard's 0.96 ERA is a single-season record. Keefe and Leonard are the only two pitchers ever to allow less than one run per nine innings pitched in a single season. The widest margin of victory for an ERA champion is 1.96 runs, achieved when Martínez' 1.74 ERA led Clemens' 3.70 in the American League during the 2000 season. The largest margin of victory in the National League is 1.26 runs—Dazzy Vance's 2.61 ERA over Carl Hubbell's 3.87 in 1930. The smallest margin of victory for an ERA champion is .009 runs. Although the statistic is traditionally recorded to two decimal places by most the 1988 American League title was decided by a margin of less than one hundredth of a run when Allan Anderson's ERA of 2.446 (55 earned runs in  innings) bested Teddy Higuera's 2.455 mark (62 earned runs in  innings). Other contests decided by one hundredth or less include Luis Tiant's 1.91 ERA ahead of Gaylord Perry's 1.92 in 1972 and Mark Fidrych (2.34) over Vida Blue (2.35) in 1976."

USC's Cheryl Miller was named the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament.\nNotable events.\nNeither semifinal game in the final four turned out to be close. Defending national champion Louisiana Tech beat long time powerhouse Old Dominion by sixteen points, handing them their 30th consecutive victory. In the other semifinal, Southern California had an easier time, beating Georgia by 24 points. This set up the championship game between the only two top seeds to advance to the Final Four.\nThe two teams had met twice before in regular season, both coming away with a win, but in both cases, on the opponents home court. USC beat the Lady Techsters in Louisiana, 64–58, giving the La Tech team their only loss for the year. La Tech turned around and beat USC in Los Angeles by two points in January, one of only two losses suffered by the USC team all season.\nThe game came down to the final seconds. USC had a two-point lead with six seconds left in the game, and freshman star Cheryl Miller at the line for a one-and-one attempt. In the era before the three point shot, simply making the foul shot would virtually guarantee the win. But Miller missed the free throw, and the Techsters grabbed the rebound. The Lady Techsters ran up the court, where Kim Mulkey took the final shot, but it failed to go in, and USC won their first national championship.\nRecords.\nIn the National championship game, Jennifer White hit eight of nine free throw attempts to set a championship game record for free throw percentage.\nIn the same game, Cheryl Miller attempted 14 free throws, a national championship record.\nThe NCAA did not officially start keeping track of blocked shots in women's basketball until 1998 (it had begun doing so in the men's game in 1986). However, Anne Donovan of Old Dominion had twelve blocked shot in a regional game, two more than the official record of ten.\nQualifying teams – automatic.\nThirty-six teams were selected to participate in the 1983 NCAA Tournament.

In sixteen cases, the automatic bid was the only representative from the conference. Thirteen at-large teams were selected from six of the conferences. In addition, three independent (not associated with an athletic conference) teams earned at-large bids.\nBids by state.\nThe thirty-six teams represented twenty-four states, plus Washington, D.C.\nCalifornia and Pennsylvania had the most teams with three each. Twenty-six states did not have any teams receiving bids.\nFirst round.\nIn 1983, the field expanded from 32 to 36 teams. The teams were seeded, and assigned to four geographic regions, with seeds 1-9 in each region. The 8 and 9 seeds in each region played a play-in game, called the opening round (OR). In the opening round and Round 1, the higher seed was given the opportunity to host the first-round game, and all but one of the higher seeds hosted.

Sullivan was named to the American League (AL) All-Star team, in and , and was elected to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame, in 2008.\nSullivan was one of the tallest pitchers of his time, standing tall. After the season, the Red Sox traded him to the Phillies for another towering right-hander, -tall Gene Conley. Coincidentally, Conley had been the winning pitcher and Sullivan the loser of the 1955 All-Star Game. A walk-off home run by Stan Musial on the first pitch from Sullivan in the bottom of the 12th inning brought the midsummer classic to an abrupt end. Sullivan had entered the game with two men out in the eighth and had held the National League (NL) scoreless for 3 innings prior to Musial’s clout.\nIn 1955, Sullivan topped the AL with 260 innings pitched and tied with Whitey Ford for the most wins (18). For his career, he posted a 97–100 win–loss record, with a 3.60 earned run average (ERA), in 351 pitching appearances.

The annual contests featured teams of three (two since 2011) players representing their country against other such teams. Steve Davis has won the event more times than any other player, with four titles for England.\nHistory.\nThe event began in 1979 as the World Challenge Cup with the sponsorship of State Express. It was held at the Haden Hill Leisure Centre, Birmingham, with six teams participating: England, Northern Ireland, Wales, Canada, Australia and Rest of the World. The teams were broken into two round-robin groups and the matches were best of 15 frames. The top teams in the groups met in the final. In 1980 the tournament moved to the New London Theatre and the Northern Ireland team was replaced by an All-Ireland team.\nThe event was renamed to the World Team Classic in 1981 and moved to the Hexagon Theatre in Reading. The matches were reduced to best of seven and the top two teams from the groups advanced to the semi-finals. This time seven teams competed. Team Rest of the World were replaced by Team Scotland and instead of an All-Ireland team both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland fielded teams. After the 1983 event State Express ended their sponsorship of the event and the tournament's place in the snooker calendar was taken by the Grand Prix.\nThe event was moved to spring for the 1984/1985 season and the event was renamed the World Cup. It was held at the International, Bournemouth. The tournament also became a knock-out contest and featured eight teams. Ireland and Northern Ireland fielded a combined team, known as All-Ireland, the Rest of the World team returned and the defending champions, England, had two teams. The event was terminated after the 1990 event.\nThe event was briefly revived for 1996 and it was held at the Amari Watergate Hotel in Bangkok, Thailand. There were many entries and qualification was held. The 20 qualified teams were split into four groups of five and the top two teams of the groups advanced to the quarter-finals.\nOn 22 March 2011 it was revealed that the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association planned to revive the event with the sponsorship of PTT and EGAT. It was held between 11 and 17 July at the Bangkok Convention Centre, Bangkok and twenty two-men teams participated at the tournament."

        "text": "Gregor Alan Olson (born March 1, 1963) is an American football coach who is the former quarterbacks coach for the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL). He has been an offensive coordinator for the Detroit Lions, St. Louis Rams, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Oakland Raiders, Jacksonville Jaguars, and the Oakland / Las Vegas Raiders.\nCoaching career.\nEarly career.\nOlson was offensive coordinator and quarterback coach at Central Washington University from 1990–1993, where he coached quarterback Jon Kitna, who later played sixteen seasons in the NFL. While at Central, Olson also coached the wrestling team. Prior to joining the CWU coaching staff, he was a graduate assistant at Washington State University for three seasons; he coached the defensive backs for a season and was the linebacker coach for two years. He also coached running backs at Spokane Falls Community College in 1986.\nAfter leaving CWU, Olson coached quarterbacks at the University of Idaho for three seasons, then moved on to Purdue University in July 1997.\nPurdue University.\nAt Purdue, Olson played a key role in helping OC Jim Chaney in the development of future Pro Bowler and Super Bowl-winning quarterback Drew Brees. Under Chaney and Olson, Brees was a Heisman Trophy finalist in 1999 and 2000 while winning the Maxwell Award as the nation's most outstanding player in 2000, as the Boilermakers won the Big Ten title and met Washington in the Rose Bowl.\nOlson previously served as the quarterbacks coach of the Detroit Lions, where he worked with Joey Harrington. He served as Lions offensive coordinator following the firing of Steve Mariucci and the demotion of Ted Tollner during the 2005 season.\nSt. Louis Rams.\nHe was the offensive coordinator of the St. Louis Rams from 2006-2007. In his first year with the Rams in 2006, he helped guide a high-powered offense that ranked sixth in the NFL in total offense (360.4 yards per game) and a passing offense that ranked third (247.6) in the NFC. Under Olson's direction the Rams became just the fourth team in NFL history to produce a 4,000 yard passer (Marc Bulger), a 1,500 yard rusher (Steven Jackson) and two 1,000 yard receivers (Torry Holt and Isaac Bruce). Bulger, Holt and Bruce were all selected to the Pro Bowl. Bulger also posted career-highs in passing yards (4,301), passing touchdowns (24), and passing attempts (588) and completions (370) while ranking second in the NFL in interception percentage (1.4%). Jackson also had a career-year in 2006, leading the NFL in yards from scrimmage with 2,334, and he led all NFL running backs with 90 receptions and was fifth in the NFL in rushing yards with 1,528.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nIn January 2008, Olson was hired by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to be their quarterbacks coach following the dismissal of Paul Hackett. On September 3, 2009, the day before the team's final preseason game, the Buccaneers announced that Olson would replace Jeff Jagodzinski as offensive coordinator. Olson was responsible for the development of QB Josh Freeman, the 17th overall pick in the 2009 draft. Under Olson's guidance, Freeman threw for 8,898 yards and 51 touchdowns in his first three seasons as a starter. In 2011, Freeman ranked eighth in the NFL with a 62.8 completion percentage and 13th with 3,592 passing yards. In Olson's second season as offensive coordinator with the Bucs in 2010, Freeman ranked sixth in the NFL with a 95.9 passer rating while throwing for 3,451 yards, 25 touchdowns and only six interceptions. Olson helped guide the Buccaneers to one of their best offensive seasons in team history, setting franchise records for yards per play (5.61), average per rush (4.64 yards), average per pass play (7.21), passer rating (96.2) and fewest interceptions thrown (six). The Buccaneers also finished with the fourth-most points scored (341), third-most yards in total offense (5,362) and second-best third down percentage (42.2%) in a single season in team history.\nThe Buccaneers were the youngest team in the NFL in 2010 and WR Mike Williams, a fourth-round draft pick, finished the year leading all rookie receivers in the league in every major receiving category while setting a single-season team record with 11 touchdown receptions. RB LeGarrette Blount's 1,007 rushing yards led all rookie running backs and he became just the second undrafted rookie running back in NFL history to finish with over 1,000 yards.

        "text": "The Brunei National Rugby Team represents Brunei in international rugby union. They have yet to make their debut at the Rugby World Cup. It is governed by the Brunei Rugby Football Union (BRFU).\nHistory.\nRugby Union, which is played in 105 countries around the world, has been played in Brunei since the 1950s. \nThe Brunei Rugby Football Union was set up in 1977, affiliated to the Rugby Football Union (RFU) of Twickenham. From then on, Brunei regularly sent teams to participate in regional 'Sevens' competitions, particularly the SCC Sevens in Singapore and the prestigious Hong Kong Sevens.\nSince joining the Asian Rugby Football Union, the Brunei Rugby Team has taken part in a number of international competitions. Although presently recording a somewhat unfavorable Win-loss ratio in the international rugby scene, Brunei rugby is continually improving with efforts concentrating on youth players' development through the Under-19 Squad.\nThe Brunei national rugby union team plays in the Asian Rugby Football Union 6th Division along with Indonesia, Cambodia and Laos.\nRecord.\nBelow is a table of the representative rugby matches played by the Brunei national XV at test level up until 21 June 2014:\nUnder-19 Squad.\nThe Under-19 National Rugby Squad of Brunei is seen as a platform from which the Brunei Rugby Football Union seeks to develop young players for the Senior team. Currently, the Under-19 squad has played in two Asian Under-19 Rugby Tournaments (as of September 2007) in Lahore, Pakistan and Taipei, Taiwan respectively. \nThe first ever Brunei Under-19 Rugby International was played against the Pakistan Under-19 Team at the Fortress Stadium in Lahore. Brunei emerged victorious with a scoreline of 14-5 in their favour - an upset considering the comparative populations and rugby history of the respective countries. Former Fiji National coach George Dreadon Simpkin commented on the impressive pace of the Bruneian backline whilst spectating the encounter. The free-running style of open, fast-paced play has become a trademark of the Bruneian team, although it has come under heavy criticism for sacrificing form and discipline in the favour of quick, energy-consuming tries.\nThe members of the first ever Brunei Under-19 Squad selected for the 2005 Asian Under-19 Rugby Tournament are as follows:\nManager: Stuart Alpe \nCoaches: Tim Lian (Backs), Shafeek Kamalie (Forwards)\nPlayers: \n1.

The game was held on July 10, 2001 at Safeco Field in Seattle, Washington, home of the Seattle Mariners of the American League. The American League defeated the National League, 4–1. This was Cal Ripken Jr.'s 19th and final All-Star Game. It was also the final All-Star Game for San Diego Padres right fielder Tony Gwynn.\nThe American League squad for the game featured eight players from the Seattle Mariners.\nRosters.\nNational League.\nNotes\nGame.\nGame summary.\nBefore the start of the first inning, Alex Rodriguez voluntarily elected to switch to third base to allow Cal Ripken Jr. to play at the shortstop position one final time at the All-Star Game, which the crowd gave a standing ovation. The move allowed Ripken to set the record for most MLB All-Star appearances at shortstop (15). Seattle's own Ichiro Suzuki gave his hometown fans something to cheer for early, when in the first, he singled off starter (and former Mariner) Randy Johnson, and then stole second. Johnson stranded him at second to hold the AL scoreless in the first inning. Ripken followed this with a home run in the third inning, which also got a standing ovation, to put the AL up 1–0.\nThe AL scored one more run in the fifth when Iván Rodríguez singled home Jason Giambi to make it 2–0. Ryan Klesko hit a sacrifice fly to cut the lead to one in the sixth, scoring Jeff Kent from third. In the sixth, with the score 2–1, Derek Jeter and Magglio Ordóñez hit back to back home runs off Jon Lieber to extend the AL's lead to 4–1.\nThat ended the scoring for the night. Mariner closer Kazuhiro Sasaki retired the side in order in the ninth to secure the win for the AL. Cal Ripken was awarded the game's MVP, becoming the fourth player ever—and first from the American League—to win two All-Star Game MVP awards."

He won 12 caps for Wales and was seen as intelligent, mobile forward player. Graham is most notable within rugby for his captaincy of Newport, which saw the team through one of their most successful periods, including the 1891–92 \"invincible\" season.\nClub career.\nBorn in Newcastle upon Tyne in the North of England, Graham had left Tyneside to find work in Newport. While in Newport he joined the rugby club, making his debut on 15 October 1886 against the Cardiff Harlequins. In 1888, Graham was part of the Newport team to face the first Southern hemisphere touring team the New Zealand Māoris. Led by Theo Harding, Newport were out-muscled by the Māoris, losing three tries to nil. By 1890, Graham had been made the team captain, an honour he would hold for four consecutive seasons.\nThe Newport team of the time included several players who were part of Wales's first Triple Crown-winning side. Graham's vice captain was Wales front row specialist Jim Hannan, while the rest of the team included internationals Arthur Boucher, Harry Packer, Harry Day and Welsh rugby legend Arthur Gould. Graham initiated a policy of weekly training in the teams gymnasium and an avoidance of alcohol. Welsh sports journalist 'Dromio' wrote that under Graham's captaincy '...the dressing room became a school for footballers'.\nDuring the 1891–92 season, Newport, under the captaincy of Graham, played 33 games, winning 29, drawing 4 and losing none. With 72 goals and 95 tries scored and only three goals and five tries conceded, it was one of the greatest seasons in the team's history.\nInternational career.\nGraham made his international debut for Wales in a match against Ireland as part of the 1890 Home Nations Championship. Under the captaincy of team mate Gould, Wales drew the game 3–3 with the Welsh points coming from a try from another Newport player, Charlie Thomas. Although Graham missed the next Wales game, the opening match of the 1891 Championship to England at Newport's Rodney Parade, he was reselected for the final two games of the tournament.\nAfter playing two matches for Wales in a disappointing 1892 season, Graham played his only full Home Nations Championship in 1893. After a narrow win over England in the opening game at the Cardiff Arms Park, Wales were on fine form in an away victory over Scotland. The last match at Stradey Park saw Wales beat Ireland and lift the Triple Crown for the first time in the country's history. Graham would play four more matches for Wales over the next two seasons, though would only play in one more win for his country, in a match against Scotland in 1894. In Graham's penultimate international game he scored his only points for his country, when he scored a try at St. Helen's in 1895.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "text": "Match referee Mike Denness, a former England captain, found six India players guilty of various offences during the second test match of India's 2001 tour of South Africa, played between 16 and 20 November 2001 at St George's Park, Port Elizabeth. The severity of Denness's punishment to an unprecedented six players was viewed by the India media as motivated by racism, outraged the general public and remains controversial to this day.\nSecond Test.\nIn the laws of cricket, tampering with the ball is a serious offence, and considered to be cheating. Tendulkar was caught on camera running his nail around the seam of the ball multiple times which was deemed by Denness as falling under rules against cleaning the ball without the umpires permission, but was widely reported as being considered ball tampering. The other incidents were examples of players excessively appealing, and in the case of Sehwag, charging toward the Umpire at the Bowler's end after knowingly claiming a dropped catch. As there were multiple incidents involving multiple players, team captain Sourav Ganguly was also cited for failing to control his team's behaviour.\nWhile there had been other incidents of South African players appealing in a similar manner, as these had not been reported to Denness by the on-field umpires, he was unable to intervene.\nIn addition to forfeiture of a certain percentage of their match fees, the following suspensions were handed to the Indian players:\nDenness was heavily criticised for failing to explain his actions at the press conference announcing the punishments, which was caused by the ICC regulations preventing Denness from doing anything more than explaining the charges. Denness himself had not wished to hold the press conference and had been ordered too by the ICC.\nIndian journalists hounded Denness regarding an alleged failure to fine Shaun Pollock for what Indian reporters described as \"similar\" incidents of excessive appealing. The incident infuriated the Indian cricket establishment, precipitating an international cricketing, political and administrative crisis. In response to Denness's inability to explain his actions at the press conference, former Indian cricketer Ravi Shastri, who was then working as a commentator, stated \"If Mike Denness cannot answer questions, why is he here? We know what he looks like.\"\nPublic outrage, \"Unofficial\" Test and Sehwag's ban.\nThere was a huge outrage in India where protestors took to the streets and burnt effigies of Denness. The matter was raised in the Indian parliament, the popular press termed Denness a racist, and the ICC was accused of discriminating against the emerging Third World.\nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) threatened to call off its tour of South Africa unless Denness was replaced as match referee for the third Test, scheduled for 23–27 November at SuperSport Park, Centurion. The International Cricket Council (ICC) supported Denness but the South African board sided with the BCCI's position and the two teams played an \"unofficial\" Test instead. Denness, who was not even allowed to enter the stadium, was replaced as match referee by the South African Denis Lindsay. Consequently, the ICC declared the match to be \"unofficial\" and instead classified it as a \"friendly five-day match\"; the Test series was thus limited to the two matches already completed, with South Africa winning 1–0.\nThe ICC upheld the ban on Sehwag for the subsequent Test, but overturned the bans on Tendulkar and Ganguly. The subsequent England tour to India was placed in jeopardy when India picked Sehwag in the Test squad. Subsequent to this development, the ICC issued a warning that any Test match with Sehwag in the Indian team would not be considered an official Test until Sehwag served his ban. After negotiations with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the ICC, and in the general interest of cricket, Sehwag was dropped from the team for the first Test against England.\nAfter the incident.\nMike Denness served as match referee in only two more Tests and three more One Day Internationals. These were all in the series between Pakistan and the West Indies in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, during January and February 2002. He retired as a match referee for health reasons, and died in 2013 from cancer.\nAn ICC Disputes Resolution Committee hearing headed by Michael Beloff QC, the then Chairman of the ICC Code of Conduct Commission, was scheduled to hear the case on 6–7 June 2002. But the hearing was postponed a week before its scheduled date due to the ill-health and surgery plans of Denness.\nThe Resolution Committee never met to decide on the merits of the cases of Denness and the Indian team as the BCCI decided to forgo the case in view of Denness' heart surgery."

        "text": "Brian Stuart Johnston (born 13 November 1958 in Dunedoo, New South Wales) is an Australian former rugby league footballer and administrator. He played with the St George Dragons and represented for the Australian national rugby league team on one occasion. Johnston's position of choice was but his speed also saw him play on the , especially in representative teams.\nCareer.\nAn athletic speedster who played Colts for Eastern Suburbs RUFC while studying at the Institute of Technology in Sydney, Johnston signed with St George in 1980 and played for New South Wales in the State of Origin series on eight occasions between 1984–1989. He represented in the centres or at wing for the Blues in all three games of the 1987 State of Origin series plus the 4th 'exhibition' game played in Los Angeles. He was also selected for one game in the 1984, 1985 and 1986 Origin series. After missing the 1988 series, Johnston was recalled for Game 3 of the 1989 State of Origin series in what would be his final representative appearance.\nInjury and form lapses caused Johnston to miss a place in St. George's 1985 Grand Final side which went down 6–7 to the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, although he did play in the reserve grade grand final win against Canberra. Johnston was considered unlucky not to tour with the 1986 Kangaroos.\nBrian Johnston played in his only test for Australia in 1987, coming off the reserves bench in Australia's shock 6–13 loss to New Zealand at Lang Park in Brisbane.\nJohnston assumed the St George captaincy in 1989 but retired at the beginning of the 1990 season because of injury.\nHe was awarded Life Membership of the St. George Dragons club in 1990.\nAdministrative career.\nAfter football, he became St George's chief executive officer in 1996. He was named Australian Test manager for the 1999 ANZAC Test. Johnston drew criticism of his handling of the sacking of Craig Gower for misbehaviour in the week before the Test. He resigned in 1999 because of ill health.\nSources.\n\"Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players, St George/Illawarra\" edition, Alan Whiticker &amp; Glen Hudson"

        "title": "Cal Ripken's Real Baseball",
        "text": "Cal Ripken's Real Baseball, also known as Real Baseball Online or Ultimate Baseball Online, was the first free-to-play baseball based massively multiplayer online sports game (MMOSG). Operating from 2003 until 2008, the game was developed and published by American company Netamin Communication Corporation. The game was designed to allow 18 human-controlled players to compete simultaneously in virtual game, though the number was later reduced due to lag issues. Former Major League Baseball player Darrell Evans served as the game's spokesperson/ambassador prior to Cal Ripken's endorsement of the game. After it ceased operation in 2008, a fan-led open source project was attempted before Real Baseball's successor, Big League Online, was released for beta testing in early 2011.\nDevelopment and history.\nNetamin Communication Corporation was the developer behind Real Baseball Online, with the company having been founded in 1999. Netamin became the world's first company to develop the technology to build a Massively Multiplayer Online Sports Game (MMSOG), led by its founder and CEO (Chief Entertainment Officer), Andy Wang. The game entered live Beta testing in April 2004 and late in its development was associated with Disney/ESPN. Former Major League Baseball player Darrell Evans served as the game's \"Ambassador\" for the majority of its history until shortly after the ESPN deal was signed. After the release of Ultimate Baseball Online 2006 (known simply as UBO), the game had officially ended its Beta phase. Netamin announced a monthly subscription fee for UBO in September 2006, consisting of a $7.95 monthly fee for early adopters and a $9.95 monthly charge for new players. The subscription fee was met with negative reaction by players, prompting Netamin to create a new season and league system, while making the game free to play for those only participating in pickup baseball games.\nThe game still had its share of bugs and other issues, as explained in the download page on CNET.com. Even though Disney/ESPN insisted the game get visual face lift, this introduced more problems than it solved and ultimately led to the game's demise. Players angry over the subscription fees lashed out at what were known as \"General Managers\" or \"GM's\", people who worked for Netamin who overlooked games and tournaments online on the games message boards. Player reception to paid service led Netamin to try to find other ways to attract players and defray costs, eventually leading to in-game advertising.\nNetamin offered discounts to players who signed up for six months or one year subscriptions and gave away free months of subscriptions for winning in tournaments but nothing lured large enough numbers of players. Netamin then tried to offer new players a limited time free play where they could download and play the game for free, but once they reached a certain level were forced to pay if they wanted to continue. This also failed, and Netamin was at a loss to gain subscriptions. With seasoned players leaving the game and new player not sticking around to pay for the game, Netamin was forced to end subscription fees and once again offer the game to play for free.\nGameplay.\nReal Baseball was a massively multiplayer online sports game capable of fielding up to 18 players a game, occupying all active positions in the game of baseball. However, players often refuse to field 18 due to lag and synchronization issues, and games rarely ended with all their original participants. This prompted a later revision in the game where Netamin only allowed ten human players total between two competing teams. Game characters are based on a level of ranks for a specific range of levels, from 0-99, with 99 being the maximum level attained. The game-coded team names of Home and Away teams are used instead of the player created team names; therefore, players can play with each other in normal servers regardless of the team they belong. Servers are divided by players under level 10 and over level 11. Team play is only enforced however, as expected, in Team Tournaments and the UBO League. Game settings also allows the option day and night of three, six, and nine inning games, with extra innings if necessary in two stadiums.\nBatting power was supposed to be amplified through the addition of parameter points in body strength and stamina. Stamina was never implemented.\nRBO League.\nReal Baseball Online (RBO) hosted seasonal leagues that featured multiple teams of different levels playing against each other for the championship. Managed by Netamin and Game Masters, there were three league classes: MVP, All-Star, and Major. Current Leagues include a 10-game regular season for all participating teams, 3-game wildcard playoffs, 4-game division finals, and a 5-game league championship for eligible teams. Press Coverage and Awards are also presented during the league seasons written by the official RBO players who are better off writing than playing the game. Winners of RBO Leagues qualified for the Best of RBO competition, which never took place.\nRBO Promotions.\nHats, shirts, pens, keychains, and Darrell Evans autographed baseballs were given away as prizes for entering tournaments. Pay to play tournaments were added to fund prizes for the teams who entered. In-game advertisements were later added to fund future prizes such as \"The Best of UBO\" tournament that never happened. Players were also able to purchase higher leveled characters in the game. Past prizes included iPods, PSP's, Tickle Me Elmo dolls, Domino's Pizza, Michael J. Fox Bobbleheads, Giftcards, and level upgrades.\nReception.\nThe game received a variety of press coverage, and some differing opinions about the game. Specifically for UBO 2006, GameShark rated it a \"B−\", while Operation Sports rated the game an \"8\". Additional reviews and press coverage included:\nShutdown and baseball MMOSG future.\nReal Baseball Online became inaccessible to play in October 2008. The main webpage of Real Baseball posted a statement saying, \"The service for Cal Ripken's Real Baseball is currently halted until further notice. We apologize for any inconvenience.\" Not long after, Netamin's own corporate webpage ceased to exist, cementing the demise of the game. A fan-initiated open-source project titled \"Multiplayer Baseball Online\" was in active development from about early 2009 until mid-2010, when the project was halted. Sometime during 2010 a new company carried over the previous Real Baseball game into a new endeavor called Big League Online. Big League Online soon went down as well, as nothing has been heard from the developers in over a year."

        "text": "One Day International (ODI) cricket is played between international cricket teams who are Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC) as well as the top four Associate members. Unlike Test matches, ODIs consist of one inning per team, having a limit in the number of overs, currently 50 overs per innings – although in the past this has been 55 or 60 overs. ODI cricket is List-A cricket, so statistics and records set in ODI matches also count toward List-A records. The earliest match recognised as an ODI was played between England and Australia in January 1971; since when there have been over 4,000 ODIs played by 28 teams. \nThis is a list of England ODI records and is based on the List of One Day International cricket records.\nKey.\nThe top five records are listed for each category, except for the team wins, losses, draws and ties, all round records and the partnership records. Tied records for fifth place are also included. Explanations of the general symbols and cricketing terms used in the list are given below. Specific details are provided in each category where appropriate. All records include matches played for England only, and are correct .\nTeam records.\nTeam wins, losses, draws and ties.\n, England has played 788 ODI matches resulting in 397 victories, 351 defeats, 9 ties and 31 no results for an overall winning percentage of 50.38\nTeam scoring records.\nMost runs in an innings.\nThe highest innings total scored in ODIs came in the match between England and the Netherlands in June 2022.

The lowest match aggregate in ODI history for England is 91 scored at the 1979 Cricket World Cup against Canada.\nResult records.\nAn ODI match is won when one side has scored more runs than the total runs scored by the opposing side during their innings. If both sides have completed both their allocated innings and the side that fielded last has the higher aggregate of runs, it is known as a win by runs. This indicates the number of runs that they had scored more than the opposing side. If the side batting last wins the match, it is known as a win by wickets, indicating the number of wickets that were still to fall.\nGreatest win margins (by runs).\nThe greatest winning margin by runs in ODIs was New Zealand's victory over Ireland by 290 runs in the only ODI of the 2008 England tour. The largest victory recorded by England was during the aforementioned match against Australia in June 2018 when they won by 242 runs.\nGreatest win margins (by balls remaining).\nThe greatest winning margin by balls remaining in ODIs was England's victory over Canada by 8 wickets with 277 balls remaining in the 1979 Cricket World Cup.\nGreatest win margins (by wickets).\nA total of 55 matches have ended with chasing team winning by 10 wickets with West Indies winning by such margins a record 10 times.

England has achieved a victory by this margin on three occasions.\nNarrowest win margins (by wickets).\nThe narrowest margin of victory by wickets is 1 wicket which has settled 55 such ODIs. Both West Indies and New Zealand have recorded such victory on eight occasions. England has won the match by a margin of one wicket on seven occasions.\nGreatest loss margins (by runs).\nEngland's biggest defeat by runs was against South Africa at the Wankhede Stadium during the 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup.\nGreatest loss margins (by balls remaining).\nThe greatest winning margin by balls remaining in ODIs was England's victory over Canada by 8 wickets with 277 balls remaining in the 1979 Cricket World Cup.

England has suffered loss by this margin two times.\nNarrowest loss margins (by wickets).\nEngland has suffered defeat by 1 wicket five times.\nTied matches.\nA tie can occur when the scores of both teams are equal at the conclusion of play, provided that the side batting last has completed their innings. \nThere have been 37 ties in ODIs history with England involved in 9 such games.\nTies are no longer possible in ODIs as if scores are level at the end of the second batting team's innings, the game is decided by a 'super-over' (played ad infinitum).\nThis happened at the end of England's 2019 tie with New Zealand (which happened to be the World Cup final). England won after a tied super-over by virtue of a better boundary count in the 50-over game (this method is no longer used to decide games where a super-over is played after a tie at 50 overs). \nIndividual records.\nBatting records.\nMost career runs.\nA run is the basic means of scoring in cricket. A run is scored when the batsman hits the ball with his bat and with his partner runs the length of of the pitch.\nIndia's Sachin Tendulkar, with 18,246, has scored the most runs in ODIs, ahead of Kumar Sangakkara of Sri Lanka with 14,234 and Ricky Ponting of Australia with 13,704.

He made 27 dismissals during the 1998-99 Carlton &amp; United Series. English record is held by Geraint Jones when he made 20 dismissals during the 2005 Natwest Series.\nFielding records.\nMost career catches.\nCaught is one of the nine methods a batsman can be dismissed in cricket. The majority of catches are caught in the slips, located behind the batsman, next to the wicket-keeper, on the off side of the field. Most slip fielders are top order batsmen.\nSri Lanka's Mahela Jayawardene holds the record for the most catches in ODIs by a non-wicket-keeper with 218, followed by Ricky Ponting of Australia on 160 and Indian Mohammad Azharuddin with 156.Paul Collingwood is the leading catcher for England.\nMost catches in an innings.\nSouth Africa's Jonty Rhodes is the only fielder to have taken five catches in an innings.

Eoin Morgan is the most experienced England player having represented the team on 225 occasions.\nMost consecutive career matches.\nTendulkar also holds the record for the most consecutive ODI matches played with 185. He broke Richie Richardson's long standing record of 132 matches.\nMost matches as captain.\nRicky Ponting, who led the Australian cricket team from 2002 to 2012, holds the record for the most matches played as captain in ODIs with 230 (including 1 as captain of ICC World XI team). 2019 Cricket World Cup winning skipper Eoin Morgan has led England in 126 matches.\nYoungest players on debut.\nThe youngest player to play in an ODI match is claimed to be Hasan Raza at the age of 14 years and 233 days. Making his debut for Pakistan against Zimbabwe on 30 October 1996, there is some doubt as to the validity of Raza's age at the time. The youngest England player to play in an ODI was Rehan Ahmed who at the age of 18 years and 205 days debuted in the third ODI of the series against Bangladesh in March 2023.\nOldest players on debut.\nThe Netherlands batsmen Nolan Clarke is the oldest player to appear in an ODI match.

Playing in the 1996 Cricket World Cup against South Africa in 1996 at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium in Rawalpindi, Pakistan he was aged 47 years and 257 days.\nPartnership records.\nIn cricket, two batsmen are always present at the crease batting together in a partnership. This partnership will continue until one of them is dismissed, retires or the innings comes to a close.\nHighest partnerships by wicket.\nA wicket partnership describes the number of runs scored before each wicket falls. The first wicket partnership is between the opening batsmen and continues until the first wicket falls. The second wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the number three batsman. This partnership continues until the second wicket falls. The third wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the new batsman. This continues down to the tenth wicket partnership. When the tenth wicket has fallen, there is no batsman left to partner so the innings is closed.\nHighest partnerships by runs.\nThe highest ODI partnership by runs for any wicket is held by the West Indian pairing of Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels who put together a second wicket partnership of 372 runs during the 2015 Cricket World Cup against Zimbabwe in February 2015. This broke the record of 331 runs set by Indian pair of Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid against New Zealand in 1999\nUmpiring records.\nMost matches umpired.\nAn umpire in cricket is a person who officiates the match according to the \"Laws of Cricket\". Two umpires adjudicate the match on the field, whilst a third umpire has access to video replays, and a fourth umpire looks after the match balls and other duties. The records below are only for on-field umpires.\nCurrently active Aleem Dar of Pakistan holds the record for the most ODI matches umpired with 229. He is followed by Rudi Koertzen of South Africa and New Zealand's Billy Bowden, who officiated in 209 and 200 matches respectively.

The Commodores were ranked No. 19 in the final ESPN/USA Today (Coaches) poll.\nThe team was led by head coach Kevin Stallings and played its home games at Memorial Gymnasium.\nPreseason outlook.\nEntering the season, Vanderbilt was picked by the media attending the SEC's media days in October to finish 4th in a strong SEC East, behind the defending national champion Florida, Kentucky and Tennessee. They returned three starters: swingmen Shan Foster and Derrick Byars and point guard Alex Gordon. Foster was their leading scorer last season and was the third-leading returning scorer in the SEC. Vanderbilt lost two starters: Julian Terrell, their top rebounder (7.2 rpg), and rising-junior DeMarre Carroll, their second-leading scorer (12.1 ppg). Terrell graduated, while Carroll unexpectedly decided to transfer to Missouri shortly after the 2005–06 season ended, a decision influenced by the fact that Mizzou's new head coach Mike Anderson is his uncle.\nJunior Shan Foster was named by the league's coaches to the preseason all-SEC first team.\nRegular season.\nThe Commodores got off to a rocky 1–3 start that included an embarrassing home loss to Furman (15–16 final record, 8–10 Southern Conference). After that, Vanderbilt won 17 of their next 22 games, culminating in an 83–70 home win over then-No. 1 Florida (33–5, SEC East: 14–2, 1st). They entered the NCAA Tournament winning only 2 of their last 5 games, including two losses to Arkansas (21–14, SEC West: 7–9, 3rd), but one of the wins was a come-from-behind 67–65 home win over Kentucky (22–12, SEC East: 9–7, 4th), their fourth straight win over the Wildcats.\nVanderbilt finished the regular season tied for 2nd with Tennessee (24–11, SEC East: 10–6) in the SEC East, four games behind eventual national champion Florida (35–5, SEC East: 14–2, 1st).\nNCAA tournament.\nThe Commodores were the No. 6 seed in the East Regional and lost 66–65 to No. 2 seeded Georgetown (30–6, Big East: 13–3, 1st) at East Rutherford, New Jersey. The Commodores defeated No. 11 seeded George Washington (23–9, A-10: 11–5, 3rd) in the first round, 77–44, and No. 3 seeded Washington State (26–7, Pac-10: 13–5, 2nd), 78–74, in two overtimes, at ARCO Arena in Sacramento, California, before losing to Georgetown.\nAwards.\nFollowing the end of the regular season, head coach Kevin Stallings was named SEC Coach of the Year by his fellow SEC coaches, while senior Derrick Byars was named SEC Player of the Year by the league coaches (the AP chose Chris Lofton of Tennessee). Stallings has now led the Commodores to 20 wins in three of the last four seasons. Byars led the Commodores in scoring with 17.0 points per game and was a unanimous selection to the All-SEC first team. Junior Shan Foster, who averaged 15.6 points per game, was named to the All-SEC second team.\nIncluding NCAA Tournament games, Vanderbilt finished the season 7–3 against teams ranked in the Top 25.

        "title": "Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball",
        "text": "The Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team represents Ohio State University in NCAA Division I college basketball competition. The Buckeyes are a member of the Big Ten Conference.\nThe Buckeyes play their home games at Value City Arena in the Jerome Schottenstein Center in Columbus, Ohio, which opened in 1998. The official capacity of the center is 19,200. Ohio State ranked 28th in the nation in average home attendance as of the 2016 season.\nThe Buckeyes have won one national championship (1960), been the national runner-up four times, appeared in 10 Final Fours (one additional appearance has been vacated by the NCAA), and appeared in 27 NCAA Tournaments (four other appearances have been vacated).\nThad Matta was named the head coach of Ohio State in 2004 to replace coach Jim O'Brien, who was fired due to NCAA violations which made Ohio State vacate 113 games between 1998 and 2002. On June 5, 2017, after consecutive years of missing the NCAA Tournament, the school announced Matta would not return as head coach after 13 years and 337 wins at Ohio State. On June 9, 2017, the school hired Butler head coach Chris Holtmann as head coach.\nThe program is presently led by Jake Diebler, Holtmann's former assistant coach who was initially hired as an interim coach following Holtmann's firing in 2024.\nTeam history.\nEarly years and Olsen era (1898–1958).\nThe first basketball team at Ohio State University was formed in 1898, playing its first game against East High. Sparing success followed the Buckeyes throughout their time as an independent school. In 1912, some 13 years after forming their first basketball team, the Buckeyes joined the Big Nine Conference, which would eventually be known as the Big Ten. At first, the Buckeyes were not able to mount a sustained run, never finishing higher than second in the conference standings. In 1923, Harold Olsen became head coach, launching the longest basketball coaching dynasty for OSU (24 seasons). Olsen began to see success with the Buckeyes' first conference championship during the 1922–1923 season. The Olsen era is also highlighted by appearing in the final game for the first NCAA Championship tournament in 1939, where the Buckeyes lost to Oregon 33–46. The Buckeyes would make three more Final Four appearances under Olsen, along with winning five Big Ten championships. Following Olsen as head coach, Tippy Dye and Floyd Stahl led the Buckeyes. Not seeing the same amount of success as Olsen did, Dye and Stahl had one NCAA Tournament appearance between them. With the closing of the 1950s, the Ohio State basketball team was not considered a national powerhouse. But it continued to develop and led to the hiring of a man who would change basketball at Ohio State and bring it national fame.\nSuccess and Fred Taylor era (1958–1997).\nOf all Buckeye coaches, it was Fred Taylor who would put Ohio State basketball on the map. With the hiring of Taylor in 1958, not much was expected following an 11–11 record during the 1958–1959 season. However, in 1960, the second-year coach, Taylor, and future Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame players Jerry Lucas and John Havlicek led the Buckeyes to their first NCAA Championship Title, defeating California 75–55 in the final game. The 1960 season is the only NCAA Tournament championship that the Buckeyes have claimed. Taylor's team continued its dominance by being the runner-up the following two seasons, and making a total of five tournament appearances during Taylor's 18 seasons tenure. With the departure of his championship team, Taylor began to see teams accustomed to Ohio State basketball of the past. Taylor's last season at Ohio State in 1976 had the Buckeyes going 6–20, their worst record, only to be eclipsed by the team in 1995. Taylor achieved seven conference titles and an impressive overall winning percentage of over 65%. Past the Taylor era, Ohio State saw Eldon Miller, Gary Williams, and Randy Ayers take the reins as head coach. Between 1976 and 1997, the Buckeyes made the NCAA bracket only eight times, while being crowned conference champions only twice.\nJim O'Brien (1997–2004).\nIn 1997, Jim O'Brien was hired to replace head coach Randy Ayers. During his seven years as head coach, O'Brien drove the team to four 20+ win seasons, two Big Ten regular season co-championships, the 2002 Big Ten tournament championship, and a school record four-consecutive NCAA tournament appearances. Controversy erupted when Ohio State athletic director Andy Geiger fired O'Brien over alleged NCAA rules violations. A two-year NCAA investigation found that player Boban Savovic might have received improper benefits while he played for Ohio State. On March 10, 2006, the NCAA gave Ohio State three years' probation and ordered it to pay back all tournament money earned from 1999–2002 when Boban Savovic was on the Buckeyes' roster. In addition, Ohio State was forced to remove all references to team accomplishments by the NCAA directorate from those years including a 1999 visit to the Final Four.\nThad Matta era (2004–2017).\nThad Matta, former head coach at Butler and Xavier, was hired by Ohio State in July 2004.\nDuring Matta's first season at Ohio State, the Buckeyes compiled a 20–12 record, highlighted by a win in the final game of the season over top-ranked Illinois, which was undefeated up until that game. Ohio State was defeated by Wisconsin in the Big Ten tournament quarterfinals, and the team was ineligible for further postseason due to self-imposed sanctions related to Jim O'Brien's time at the school. The 2005–06 season opened with the Buckeyes 11–0 heading into Big Ten play. Ohio State ended the season with a 26–6 record and 12–4 record in conference, the Buckeyes' first outright Big Ten championship since the 1991–92 season. Ohio State lost to Iowa in the Big Ten tournament championship game, but received a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament. After a first round win, the Buckeyes lost to No. 7 seed Georgetown 70–52 in the second round.\nMatta's 2006–07 Ohio State team entered the season with the second-rated recruiting class in the nation, headed by Greg Oden and Mike Conley Jr., and ranked No. 4 in the preseason polls. Ohio State entered conference play with an 11–2 record, with the only defeats coming at No. 6 North Carolina and at No. 4 Florida. Ohio State's loss against No. 4 Wisconsin on January 9, 2007, was the last loss of the regular season as the Buckeyes won 14 straight games to end the season with a 27–3 record. Ohio State defeated No. 20 Tennessee and No. 2 Wisconsin during this winning streak and ended the season as the top-ranked team in the nation. Ohio State won the Big Ten tournament, defeating Wisconsin 66–49 in the championship game, and entered the NCAA tournament as the overall No. 1 seed.

Ohio State defeated Georgetown 67–60 in the semifinal game, but lost to Florida 84–75 in the National Championship game. Oden and Conley both would enter the NBA draft following the season, with Oden being drafted number one overall and Conley going fourth.\nThe 2007–08 season was a rebuilding one. Ohio State ended the season with a 19–12 record, finishing fifth in the Big Ten. It lost to Michigan State in the Big Ten tournament quarterfinals and missed out on the NCAA tournament. The Buckeyes did receive a No. 1 seed in the National Invitation Tournament, where Ohio State would defeat Massachusetts 92–85 in the championship to take the NIT title.\nOhio State began the 2008–09 season with a 9–0 record and would finish 20–9.

Turner returned later in the season and help finish the season with a 24–7 record and a share of the Big Ten regular season championship. A victory over Minnesota in the Big Ten tournament gave Matta his second Big Ten tournament title and the Buckeyes a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament.

Ohio State won 20 or more games in 12 of Matta's 13 seasons, received a berth in the NCAA Tournament eight times, made it to the Sweet Sixteen four times, and to the Final Four twice. Ohio State won the Big Ten regular-season championship five times and Big Ten tournament championship four times, appearing in the championship game six times under Matta.\nThad Matta's record at Ohio State\nChris Holtmann era (2017–2024).\nOn June 9, 2017, the school hired Butler head coach Chris Holtmann as head coach. The Buckeyes exceeded any and all expectations in Holtmann's first season in Columbus. Picked to finish no better than 11th in preseason media polls, the Buckeyes stormed out to a 9–0 record in Big Ten. Highlighting the 2017–18 season were home wins over Michigan, overcoming a first-half 20-point deficit, and No. 1 Michigan State along with a road victory at No. 3 Purdue, the Boilermakers’ only home loss of the season. Holtmann was named the 2018 Big Ten Coach of the Year after leading the Buckeyes to a 25–9 overall record, a second-place finish in the Big Ten regular-season standings (15–3). The Buckeyes were led by Big Ten Player of the Year, Keita Bates-Diop, and a four-year starter, Jae’Sean Tate; both of which are now in the NBA. The season ended on a somber note as the Buckeyes were eliminated in the second round of the 2018 NCAA tournament by Gonzaga.\nIn 2018–19, Holtmann's Buckeyes went 20–15, marking the sixth consecutive season a Holtmann team had won 20 or more games. As an 11-seed the Buckeyes knocked off 6-seed Iowa State to advance to the second round of the 2019 NCAA tournament, before being eliminated by Houston.\nThe 2019–20 season was cut short with the cancellation of the 2020 Big Ten and NCAA Tournaments. The Buckeyes posted an overall record of 21–10, which included four wins vs. Top 10 opponents (Villanova, at North Carolina, Kentucky and Maryland). Ohio State finished tied for fifth in the Big Ten at 11–9. Despite no postseason tournament, the Buckeyes managed 20 wins, marking the seventh consecutive season Holtmann-coach teams reached that plateau.\nIn a season shortened by COVID-19 implications, the 2020–21 Buckeyes went 21–10 record overall. Ohio State finished tied for fifth in the B1G (12–8) and reached the championship game of the 2021 Big Ten Tournament. The Buckeyes were led by 1st Team All-Big Ten forward EJ Liddell, and 3rd Team All-Big Ten guard Duane Washington Jr. Ohio State appeared in the AP Top 10 for the final seven weeks of the season and earned a #2 seed in the 2021 NCAA Tournament, only to lose to 15-seed Oral Roberts in the first round.\nThe 2021–22 Buckeyes posted a 20–12 record and 12–8 conference record. The team lost in the second round of the 2022 NCAA tournament to Villanova.\nHoltmann is the second Ohio State coach to win 20 or more games in his first five seasons in Columbus, joining Thad Matta (12 from 2005 to 2016). However, he has not won a conference championship, and his teams have struggled in postseason play: through his first 11 seasons as a head coach, his teams had never won a conference tournament, and had advanced beyond the first weekend of the NCAA tournament only once, leading to some criticism from fans.\nThe criticism of Holtmann continued in the 2022–23 season, as after starting the season with 10 wins in 13 games, the Buckeyes went into an extended tailspin, losing 14 of 15 games. On February 12, the Buckeyes scored just 41 points in a home loss to Michigan State, the program's lowest point total in 27 years.\nHoltmann was fired on February 14, 2024, as the team continued to struggle in conference play as the team lost 9 out of his final 11 games. Assistant coach Jake Diebler was named interim head coach after his firing.\nFacilities.\nThe Ohio State Buckeyes presently play their home games in the 19,200-seat Value City Arena. The first official home court for the Buckeyes was the Ohio Expo Center Coliseum. Constructed in 1918, the Buckeyes called this arena home between the years 1920 to 1955. The facility had a capacity of 7,000 people.\nIn 1955, a new facility was built on the campus of Ohio State named the St. John Arena named after Lynn St. John, an Ohio State basketball coach and athletic director. This building, while hosting the men's basketball team, also hosted (and still to this day hosts) volleyball, gymnastics, and wrestling. The capacity of St. John Arena is 13,276. This building is the only Buckeye arena to serve as home for an Ohio State men's basketball championship team in 1960.\nWith the aging St. John Arena over 40 years old, Ohio State University decided to build Value City Arena to hold men's and women's basketball as well as hockey. The 770,000 sq foot arena was completed in 1998 and seats 19,500 for basketball games.\nOhio State University completed a $19 million renovation to the Schottenstein Center in 2013 that includes updated locker rooms for the Men's and Women's Basketball teams, a new training room with hydrotherapy pools, a new weight room, and a new practice gym to complement the existing gym. A $34 million renovation completed in 2018 improved the concourse as well as added new space for the coaches, team shop, ticket office, and building administration.\nDuring the team's formative years the Buckeyes played their home games at the Ohio State University Armory. Built in 1897 at a cost of $115,000, the massive brick medieval style building was demolished in 1958 after damage caused by a fire. From 1897 to 1917 the Buckeyes used the building known as \"Drill Hall\" or \"The Gymnasium\" as their home court, only being asked to leave due to the outbreak of World War I. The team's overall record at the Armory was 178–104. In 1919, without a definite home, the team played some of their games at Indianola Park as well as the Coliseum and the Armory. Finally, in 1920, the team officially moved to the Ohio State Fairgrounds and played in their home games at the Ohio Expo Center Coliseum. During their time at the Coliseum, the Buckeyes played in five national title games.\nCoaches.\nThe Buckeyes have had 14 coaches in their 110-year history. Thad Matta, who was hired in 2004, and led the Buckeyes to five NCAA Tournament appearances and two Final Four appearances during the 2006–07 and 2011–12 seasons. The only Ohio State coach to win a national championship was Fred Taylor in 1960.\nAccomplishments.\nNCAA tournament seeding history.\n\"The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\"\nNIT results.\nThe Buckeyes are two time NIT champions (1986, 2008).\nBig Ten tournament championships.\nOhio State has won 4 Big Ten tournament championships since its inception during the 1997–98 season. Ohio State won their first title in 2002 under Jim O'Brien (later vacated), while winning 4 under head coach Thad Matta. Under Matta, the Buckeyes appeared in the Big Ten tournament championship five consecutive seasons from 2009 to 2013.\nRecord vs. Big Ten opponents.\nThe Ohio State Buckeyes lead the all-time series vs. seven Big Ten opponents. Two of the all-time series are within three games. These records do not include vacated games (e.g. Purdue does count all their games played against Ohio State and lead the series 94–93 according to their records. Iowa counts all games played against OSU and lead the series 84–83 according to their records).\nAwards.\nFirst-Team All-Big Ten.\nAll award data taken from\nAll-time statistical leaders.\nSingle-game leaders.\nAll statistical data taken from.\nNotable players.\nRetired numbers.\nOhio State has retired five jersey numbers.\nHonored coaches.\nTwo longtime head coaches have been honored with banners which hang alongside the retired numbers:"

        "text": "The Montenegrin Men's Handball First League (Montenegrin: \"Crnogorska prva muška rukometna liga\") is the top men's team handball league in Montenegro. It is organized by the Handball Federation of Montenegro.\nHistory.\nBefore independence.\nDuring the history, many Montenegrin clubs played in the SFR Yugoslavia / FR Yugoslavia / Serbia and Montenegro First Handball League. Among them were RK Lovćen, RK Budućnost, RK Mornar, RK Rudar and RK Berane.\nFirst Montenegrin team which played in Yugoslav First League is Rudar, which debuted in the top-tier on season 1964–65. More than 20 years passed until next teams from Montenegro played in the top-tier. At the end of nineties, member of First League became Lovćen, and at the beginning of nineties Budućnost and Mornar. On season 1994–95, third-placed Mornar gained participation in EHF Cities Cup 1995–96 and that was the first ever performance of some Montenegrin side in European competitions.\nFrom season 1996–97, started the domination of Lovćen – who won two champion titles in FR Yugoslavia (\"1999–2000; 2000–01\"), with two consecutive seasons in EHF Champions League. On season 2000–01, Lovćen played in Champions League quarterfinals, against THW Kiel (\"29–24; 22–35\"). That was the greatest result of some Montenegrin handball team in European competitions.\nDuring the new century, except Lovćen, in the First League of FR Yugoslavia played Rudar (at that time under the name \"Pljevlja\"), Berane and Budućnost.\nBelow is the list of performances of Montenegrin clubs in Yugoslav Handball League with final placements on each season.\nThe only Montenegrin club who gained trophies in Yugoslav League was RK Lovćen.

Their biggest opponent at the time was RK Berane, who won the champions' battle during the next season.\nNext two years saw the domination of RK Budućnost from Podgorica, who won two consecutive titles. Big incidents occurred at the games during both seasons. Match RK Budućnost – RK Lovćen, which decided about national champion, played on 17 May 2009, was the most attended game in the history of Montenegrin First League (4,000 spectators). Budućnost won 28:26 (18:14) and held the first title in the club history.

        "title": "Westmount Rugby Club",
        "text": "The Westmount Rugby Football Club is a Canadian rugby club based in Westmount, Quebec.\nDespite McGill University having a team in 1874, Westmount, which claims to have been established in 1876, is the oldest independent (as opposed to college-affiliated) rugby club in North America. Under the title of Montreal Football Club, the club played its matches at the McGill University grounds. The club gathered for social matches and occasions, and never really grew in size until it associated itself with the newly founded Montreal Amateur Athletic Association – which was to become the premier sporting club at the turn of the century and figure prominently in the development of rugby in Montreal, Quebec, and ultimately the Dominion of Canada.\nThe Montreal Amateur Athletic Association came into existence June 1881 and began as a confederation of three sporting clubs: The Montreal Snow Shoe Club, The Montreal Bicycle Club, and The Montreal Lacrosse Club. These founding clubs shared the club space of the Montreal Gymnasium, located at Mansfield Street and de Maisonneuve Boulevard. In 1884, the Montreal (Rugby) Football Club had upwards of 170 active members, and its first XV achieved an undefeated season, playing clubs from Royal Military College (Kingston), Ottawa, Quebec City, Toronto, British of New York, McGill University, and Bishop's University (Lennoxville, Quebec). The Montreal (Rugby) Football Club had used the McGill University grounds and the nearby Montreal Amateur Athletic Association facility as clubroom, even though it was not formally associated with the Association until 1885.\nAlso in 1884, the Montreal (Rugby) Football club was instrumental in the formation of the Canadian Rugby Union. Three representatives from the Montreal Club were sent to meet with two representatives from the Toronto Rugby Football Club, and one from the Hamilton Rugby Football Club to meetings in Toronto and Montreal. It was decided that the union would continue to use the English rugby rules, and at the end of the season the winning club of the Quebec Championship would play the Ontario Champion for the Club Championship of the Dominion.\nWith the amalgamation of the Montreal (Rugby) Football Club into the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association in 1885, the club's grounds were shared with the Montreal Lacrosse Club in the city block downtown bound by Crescent Street, Sherbrooke Street, Bishop Street, and de Maisonneuve Boulevard. Matches were held at this ground only until 1888, when the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association moved its clubhouse to the Westmount Athletic Grounds at the junction of Saint Catherine Street and Hallowell Avenue, due to urban expansion into the downtown pitch and the subsequent dividing of the property into building lots. The Westmount property was landscaped and the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association laid down a cinder track, fences, six hundred yards of drainage, uprights, a pavilion, and a clubhouse. The pitch was, by today's standards larger than an international size rugby pitch. These grounds, aside from playing host to Montreal's rugby and lacrosse matches, also played host to Montreal's most popular sporting events such as bicycle races, athletics, ice hockey in winter, and in 1897 hosted the Jubilee Celebration of Queen Victoria's reign.\nAt the turn of the century a new quarters was needed to accommodate a rapidly growing membership. In 1905, the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association clubhouse moved to Peel Street (where it currently resides), and the Westmount Athletic Grounds was retained as the club's official athletic grounds until July 1936. The economic depression inflicted severe financial problems upon the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association, and the property was therefore sold to the City of Westmount to help alleviate the economic hardships. In the meantime, rugby football had begun to make its split in North America. Between 1910 and 1920, American-style football gained in popularity; so popular that games were now played in front of larger capacities, and the football club soon split from the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association to form a semi-professional club. Rugby continued at the Westmount Athletic Grounds until 1959, when the Athletic facility was demolished to make way for Westmount High School, and a baseball diamond was built in the middle of the pitch rendering it unsuitable for rugby.\nSince its split from the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association in the 1930s, the Rugby Football Club kept its colours of blue and white, but adopted the new name of The Montreal Scottish RFC, owing to its strong Scottish influence within the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association. For years, the Montreal Scottish RFC were the premier rugby club of Quebec, winning almost everything they could possibly arrange to compete for.\nBy the 1950s, the Montreal Scottish RFC could not accommodate the vast number of players wishing to join the club, and they took on a “Scottish-only” policy by turning away many non-Scottish players. These “exiled” players eventually formed local clubs such as The Montreal Wanderers Rugby Football Club and The Montreal Barbarians Rugby Club. Soon after, noting that this “Scottish-only” policy was not sustainable, the club policy became open to all players of all backgrounds, and the club name changed to the Westmount Rugby Football Club, named after the municipality where its home field had been located for most of its history.\nWith the demolition of The Westmount Athletic Grounds, the club moved its grounds to the nearby Villa Maria High School, before settling at Westmount Park located in the heart of the city of Westmount. By 1976, the Quebec Rugby Union had grown to six clubs (Ormstown RFC, Montreal Irish RFC, Montreal Wanderers RFC, Montreal Barbarians RC, Town of Mount Royal RFC and Westmount RFC), and Westmount RFC had changed its colours to maroon and white. Also adopted was the raven as a club symbol, owing from the municipal crest of the city of Westmount, where it figures prominently. The club became officially incorporated in 1976.\nThe club wore maroon jerseys with white shorts until 1997, when it was decided to incorporate black into the uniform.

He played as a in the National Rugby League for the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks and the Penrith Panthers as well as representing for the Queensland Maroons in State of Origin. Martin Lang is the son of Australian former international and coach John Lang, under whom he played his entire top-grade career.\nPlaying career.\nLang made his first grade debut for Cronulla-Sutherland against the Sydney City Roosters in round 21 1996 at the Sydney Football Stadium. In the same year he played in the club's qualifying final victory over Western Suburbs.\nIn 1997, Cronulla joined the rival Super League competition during the Super League war. Lang missed out on playing in Cronulla's grand final team which lost to the Brisbane Broncos. In 1999, Lang played 23 games as Cronulla won the minor premiership but suffered preliminary final heartbreak against St. George at Stadium Australia.\nLang was a hard-running prop with a straight, unswerving style when taking the ball forward. He ran 4,571 metres with the ball over the 2000 NRL season, more than any other player in the competition.\nLang's final game for Cronulla was the club's preliminary final loss against eventual premiers Newcastle in the 2001 NRL season.\nIn April, 2002, Lang was knocked unconscious by a high-tackle from Petero Civoniceva. The resulting concussion, his tenth, led to calls for the prop to retire or to change his running style. Commenting later on his concussions, Lang said, \"There was times when I'd been knocked out that you weren't aware of anything until you're sitting on the sideline and you're thinking, 'Geez, what happened?' You're not feeling fresh. It's liked you've been drugged or had an anaesthetic or something like that, you're feeling very ordinary.\"\nLang played at prop forward for the Penrith Panthers in their 2003 NRL grand final victory over the Sydney Roosters. As 2003 NRL premiers, the Penrith travelled to England to face Super League VIII champions, the Bradford Bulls in the 2004 World Club Challenge. Lang played at prop forward in the Penrith's 22–4 loss.\nRetiring at the end of the 2004 NRL season, Lang spent a period recovering from surgery on a disc in his spine. He has said he, \"pretty much couldn't do a thing for the whole of 2005. For about nine months there, I couldn't even lift up my kids.\"\nPost playing.\nMoving to the Gold Coast, Lang is now a qualified Exercise Scientist and is involved in the medical device industry. He has a research interest in the neuropathology of traumatic brain injury and the biomechanics of intervertebral disc degeneration. He previously worked as a strength and conditioning coach for the Gold Coast United FC soccer team."

        "text": "John Clarence Hicks Jr. (March 21, 1951 – October 29, 2016) was an American professional football player who was a guard in the National Football League (NFL). He is best remembered for being the last lineman to be runner-up in the vote for the Heisman Trophy.\nCollege career.\nIn 1970, Hicks came onto the Buckeye scene and won the job as a starting tackle. He missed the last 6 games of the 1971 season due to a knee injury, and was granted a medical redshirt by the NCAA. He rebounded to put together two spectacular seasons in 1972 and 1973. During Hicks' three years, Ohio State posted a 28–3–1 record, and each year, Ohio State won the Big Ten Championship and went to the Rose Bowl, making Hicks the first person from OSU to play in three Rose Bowls.\nIn 1972 Hicks was recognized as a First-team All-American selection and earned his first of two All-Big Ten honors. He repeated his All-Conference honors his senior year and again earned All-America honors, this time as a unanimous selection. His stellar senior season and dominance of the line of scrimmage caught the eye of the voters as Hicks won the Lombardi Award as the nation's most outstanding lineman and the Outland Trophy as the nation's best interior lineman. He was the runner up to running back John Cappelletti of Penn State in the voting for the 1973 Heisman trophy.\nThe comeback.\nThe 6-3, 258 pound tackle started as a sophomore in 1970 when freshman weren't eligible, and helped them go to the Rose Bowl. In 1971, he started off the season in dominant fashion before injuring his knee and missing the last six games of the season. After being granted a medical redshirt by the NCAA, he came back to become an All-American in 1972 helping the Buckeyes to go back to the Rose Bowl. Then he had his monster 1973 season. A first round draft pick of the New York Giants, he was named the NFC Rookie of the Year in 1974. However, injuries would put a halt to his pro career after just 4 seasons.\nThe Rose Bowls.\nHicks was the first player to ever start in three Rose Bowls and was part of a monster Ohio State team. The unbeaten Buckeyes lost to Stanford 27–17 in the 1971 Rose Bowl. Next year at the 1973 game, Ohio State got steamrolled by USC 42–17. But the 1974 Rose Bowl game would be unbeaten Ohio State's year to steamroll USC 42–21 as Hicks led the way to 323 rushing yards.\nProfessional career.\nHicks was selected by the New York Giants with the 3rd overall selection in the 1974 NFL draft, of which he was the only college football player invited to attend. He played with the Giants from 1974 through 1977, and in his first 3 seasons he started every regular season game for the team as a right guard. In April 1978, the Giants traded Hicks to the Pittsburgh Steelers in exchange for offensive lineman Jim Clack and wide receiver Ernie Pough. Hicks never played for the Steelers.\nPersonal.\nHicks was married to Cindy Hicks who was his second wife. He had three daughters and one son with his first wife. He has three granddaughters and two grandsons.\nOn October 30, 2016, Hicks died at his home due to complications from diabetes. He was 65."

He played college football for the Ohio State Buckeyes under head coach \nEarly years.\nBorn in Fort Valley, Georgia and raised by his great-grandparents, Johnson attended Peach County High School for three years where he played football. Upon the death of his great-grandfather, he moved to New York to live with his mother where he graduated from Long Beach High School in Long Beach, New York, playing football for his senior season.\nCollege career.\nJohnson played fullback at Ohio State from 1973 through 1976. In 1973, starting fullback Champ Henson was injured and converted linebacker Bruce Elia was named to start in Henson's place. By the end of that season, freshman Johnson had worked his way up the depth chart. Elia returned to the linebacker corps in 1974 and Henson and Johnson alternated at fullback.\nAlthough two-time Heisman Trophy winner Archie Griffin got most of the carries at tailback from 1972 to 1975, the Ohio State fullbacks still got the ball frequently and were expected to be major contributors, particularly in short-yardage situations. In 1972 the team's leading scorer was Henson, and in 1973 it was Elia. Johnson's best season was in 1975. Even though Griffin led the team with 1,450 rushing yards, Johnson still rushed for 1,059 yards and set single OSU single season records for rushing touchdowns (25) and scoring (156 points).\nOne of Johnson's more notable performances was in his junior season against North Carolina. While Griffin rushed for 157 yards, Johnson rushed for 148 yards and set a school record with He finished his career at Ohio State with 2,308 rushing yards and a school record 58 touchdowns (also a Big Ten record). His 348 points was a Buckeyes' record until surpassed by kicker Mike Nugent's 356 points \nIn 2000, Johnson was selected for the Buckeyes' All-Century Team, and he was inducted into the OSU Athletics in 2007, presented during halftime of the Akron game \nNFL career.\nA bruising runner and competent blocker, Johnson was a mainstay in the Bengals backfield. He was the team's leading rusher for all seven seasons he played for them, and scored 12 or more rushing touchdowns in three different seasons. His best season was in 1981, where he made his only Pro Bowl selection. Johnson set career highs in rushing (1,077 yards), receptions (46), receiving yards (320) and touchdowns (16), leading the team to a with home field advantage for the \nIn the postseason, Johnson helped the team record their first ever playoff win by rushing for 45 yards, catching 3 passes for 23 yards, and scoring a touchdown in the Bengals' divisional victory over the Buffalo Bills. In the AFC title game (known in NFL lore as the Freezer Bowl), Johnson rushed for 80 yards and a touchdown, while also catching a 14-yard reception as the team defeated the high-scoring San Diego Chargers to earn their first Super Bowl appearance. Cincinnati lost Super Bowl XVI at the Pontiac Silverdome to the San Francisco 49ers, who limited Johnson to just 36 rushing yards and 8 receiving yards.\nIn 1984, Johnson was traded to the Chargers in exchange for running back James Brooks. He left Cincinnati as their all-time leader in rushing yards (5,421), touchdowns (70), and second all-time scorer with 420 points. Johnson spent the first three games of the 1984 season with Chargers and spent the final 13 games with Miami before retiring after the season ended.\nIn his eight NFL seasons, Johnson rushed for 5,626 yards, caught 175 passes for 1,334 yards, and scored 82 touchdowns (76 rushing, 6 receiving); at the time of his retirement, he was sixth in NFL history in rushing touchdowns, and as of , he ranks 25th.\nJohnson has an NFL-record three straight games with at least one receiving and one rushing touchdown.\nDrug charges.\nIn , Johnson and another Bengals player testified in exchange for immunity from prosecution that they had purchased cocaine from a Cincinnati plumber, and he was suspended by the NFL for four games. In 1987, he was indicted by a federal grand jury on four cocaine-related charges—and at the time of his indictment, he was selling cars in Miami, according to \"The New York Times\" archive; he was found not guilty by a Columbus jury in February 1988."

A multi-sport athlete, he played football, basketball, and tennis in high school, but he concentrated on academics.\nHe attended college at Brown University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from the Brown University School of Engineering in 1982. In addition to his engineering coursework, he tried out for the football team and made the varsity lineup his sophomore year. Although the Brown coaching staff originally thought he would not play \"a minute of varsity ball,\" Jordan was twice named to the first-team All-Ivy League squad and he also made All-American honorable mention. After his senior season, Jordan was awarded the Tuss McLaughry Trophy as the Brown football team member \"who through sportsmanship, performance, and influence, contributed most to the sport at Brown.\" He was inducted into the Brown Bears athletic Hall of Fame in 1987.\nNFL career.\nJordan was the Vikings 7th round pick (179th overall) in the 1982 NFL draft. He played 13 seasons for the Vikings and was selected to six consecutive Pro Bowls from 1986 through 1991. He finished his NFL career with 498 receptions for 6,307 yards and 28 touchdowns. Viking head coach Jerry Burns praised Jordan's work ethic, noting that \"no one on the Vikings works harder.\" During Jordan's years with the team, the Vikings won three NFC Central division titles, made the NFL playoffs six times, and reached the 1987 NFC Championship game, which they lost 17-10 to the Washington Redskins. The Redskins went on to win Super Bowl XXII.\nJordan's career statistics compare favorably to several NFL Hall of Fame inductees. For example, Jordan's 498 career receptions and 6,307 career yards exceeds Mike Ditka's 427 career receptions and 5,812 career yards, Dave Casper's 378 career receptions and 5,216 career yards, and John Mackey's 331 career receptions and 5,236 career yards.\nJordan still holds the Vikings all-time single-game receiving record for tight ends. During a game against the Washington Redskins on November 2, 1986, Jordan caught 6 passes for 179 yards and a touchdown. No Vikings tight end has ever caught for more yards in a single game.\nPost-football career.\nAfter his retirement from the NFL, Jordan worked as a civil engineer for M.A. Mortenson of Minneapolis, Minnesota. He was elected to the Brown University Board of Trustees in 1993.\nOn October 25, 2019, the Minnesota Vikings inducted Jordan into the Vikings Ring of Honor. In announcing Jordan's selection, the Vikings co-owner and team president Mark Wilf noted that \"Steve Jordan's impact on the Vikings has carried on past his career on the field. As great a player as Steve was, he's just as great an ambassador for the Vikings and the game of football. He is a positive role model to young players about the value of education and using your platform as an NFL star for good.\"\nUpon his induction to the Ring of Honor, Jordan said, \"I look back, and it's really good that something like this can happen, someone like me, who comes out of a small school can come to the Vikings and have a successful career, not just on the field but off the field.\"\nPersonal life.\nJordan lives in Eagan, Minnesota. His son, Cameron Jordan, currently plays defensive end for the New Orleans Saints. He and his wife Anita had two more children, son Geoffrey and daughter Stephanie. Jordan is also the father-in-law of German football player Kasim Edebali."

        "title": "Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball",
        "text": "The Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball team represents the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, Arkansas in NCAA Division I men's basketball competition. The team competes in the Southeastern Conference and is coached by John Calipari. Arkansas plays its home games in Bud Walton Arena on the University of Arkansas campus. The Razorbacks are a top-twenty-five program all-time by winning percentage (.641), top-twenty program by NCAA tournament games played, top-twenty program by NCAA Tournament games won, top-fifteen program by Final Four appearances, and despite playing significantly fewer seasons than most programs in major conferences, top-thirty by all-time wins. Under the coaching leadership of Nolan Richardson, the Hogs won the national championship in 1994, defeating Duke, and appeared in the championship game the following year, finishing as runner-up to UCLA. The Razorbacks have made six NCAA Final Four appearances (1941, 1945, 1978, 1990, 1994, and 1995).\nHistory.\nEarly success under Schmidt (1923–29).\nArkansas had a relatively late start in basketball; it did not field its first team until 1923. Francis Schmidt coached the Razorbacks from the 1923–24 season until the 1928–29 season, while also coaching the football and baseball teams.\nSchmidt oversaw the construction of the gymnasium that was home to the Razorbacks from the inaugural season through the 1936–37 season. The project was headed by Schmidt and Jay Fulbright (father of future United States Senator from Arkansas, J. William Fulbright). Schmidt and Fulbright organized a group of businessmen that facilitated the transfer of a former car showroom to the university to serve as the gym for the Razorbacks. The wooden gym, made out of surplus World War I material and officially named Schmidt Gymnasium, became known as \"Schmidt's barn,\" in reference to its makeshift nature and lack of accommodations.\nAfter a difficult first year that resulted in a 17–11 overall record and a 3–9 conference record, Schmidt quickly led the Hogs to success and a dominating run in the Southwest Conference during his tenure. Building off the program's first season, the 1924–25 team finished third in the conference, quickly turning their record around to 9–3 in conference play. This second season laid the groundwork for tremendous success with Schmidt, as the Razorbacks won the conference championship outright in just the third year of the program's existence with a record of 23–2 (11–1). The 1925–26 season kicked off a string of four straight Southwest Conference championships under Schmidt, and five straight overall. Schmidt also coached the Hogs to the first of three perfect SWC seasons in program history in 1927–28, with a conference record of 12–0 and a 15.25-point average margin of victory in conference play. The 1927–28 season also marked the beginning of a school record 31-game winning streak that ran until the last few games of the next season. Schmidt's last four teams at Arkansas went a combined 75–6 (42–4).\nThe last couple years of Schmidt's dominant SWC run were marked by serious star power, with future Razorback basketball coaches Eugene Lambert Sr. and Glen Rose earning First-Team Helms Athletic Foundation All-American recognition during Schmidt's last two seasons (1928–29 and 1927–28, respectively), along with Tom Pickel earning First-Team honors from College Humor Magazine in Schmidt's final season as coach. Schmidt's Razorbacks had four of the five All-SWC selections in 1928 (Rose, Pickel, Lambert, and Wear Schoonover). During Schmidt's time at Arkansas, the Razorbacks finished first in the SWC four out of six years, and compiled an overall record of 113–22 (.837), the highest winning percentage of any Arkansas coach ever. Schmidt left Arkansas to take the football and basketball jobs at TCU, where he was coach until 1934.\nBassett years (1929–33).\nIn the 1929–30 season, Charles Bassett took over as head coach, leaving the head coaching job at Texas A&amp;M that he held for two years without finding much success, going a paltry 16–18 (5–15) in his two years as head coach in College Station, including a last-place finish in conference play for the 1927–28 Southwest Conference season. Arkansas's success under Bassett was limited to his first season as coach, when the Hogs won the Southwest Conference Championship with multi-sport star and current College Football Hall of Fame member Wear Schoonover garnering Second-Team All-American recognition from College Humor and earning First-Team All-SWC honors for the third straight season. The Razorbacks did not finish above third place in the Southwest Conference standings for the rest of Bassett's tenure. Aside from the SWC Championship in 1930, the other major bright spot in Bassett's tenure came on January 8, 1931, when the Razorbacks defeated rival Texas, 29–21, the day UT dedicated its new gym. Bassett's last season was the 1932–33 season, when the Razorbacks went 14–7 overall with a 6–6 conference record, the first time since the inaugural 1923–24 season that the Hogs did not finish the year with a winning record in conference play. After four seasons, Bassett's overall record was 62–29 (.681).\nFirst Glen Rose era (1933–42).\nGlen Rose took over in the 1933–34 season and returned the program to a competitive position within the SWC. Named a Helms Athletic Foundation First-Team All-American as a Hog in 1928, Rose was the first former player to coach the Razorbacks. Rebuilding the program after the decline under Bassett, Rose's first season as coach produced a .500 conference record (6–6) and a tie for third place in the final SWC standings. The Hogs finished with a winning conference record and no lower than second place in the conference standings for the rest of Rose's first stint with Arkansas, save for one season.\nThe 1935–36 season ended with the Hogs competing for the right to represent the United States in the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin for the first year of basketball being an official medal sport. The Razorbacks swept the other NCAA teams they played in the NCAA Olympic Playoffs, but lost in the first round of the U.S. Olympic Trials to the Universal Pictures Amateur Athletic Union team that went on to win the gold medal.\nThe following season, 1936–37 featured the last game in Schmidt Gymnasium, or \"Schmidt's barn.\" Construction of the new building, (originally known as the Field House) that came to be known as the Men's Gymnasium was under way in 1936, and was completed in the fall semester of 1937, with a capacity of 2,500. The new home for the Razorbacks was dedicated on February 4, 1938, in a 53–26 win over TCU. The Men's Gymnasium served as home for the basketball team until Barnhill Arena was completed in 1954 and the Razorbacks began playing games there in the 1955–56 season.\nThe Razorbacks won the Southwest Conference outright three times and tied for first two more times during this nine-year run. In the 1940–41 season, Rose led Arkansas to its second perfect conference record ever (12–0) en route the NCAA Final Four in the Razorbacks' first NCAA Tournament appearance. The 1940–41 season is also notable for the outstanding play of John \"Johnny\" Adams, a Helms First-Team All-American who is credited as being one of the players responsible for the proliferation of the jump shot in basketball. Adams set the single-game SWC scoring record that season with 36 points against TCU in Fort Worth on February 21, 1941. Rose finished this nine-year run with a record of 154–47 (.766). Rose went on to coach the football team for the 1944 and 1945 seasons, without much success. Rose returned to coach the basketball team a decade after he left.\nEugene Lambert (1942–49).\nFormer Razorback and All-American Eugene Lambert took the coaching job starting in the 1942–43 season. Lambert found moderate success in his first season as head coach, posting a winning record and overseeing a first in program history by coaching the first freshman to play for the Razorback varsity squad, Paul Coleman. After winning a share of the Southwest Conference Championship for the 1943–44 season, Lambert and Arkansas were selected for the NCAA tournament for the second time in program history. However, the team was forced to withdraw after tragedy struck when a car accident injured two of their starters, Ben Jones and Deno Nichols, and killed Eugene Norris, a physical education teacher that accompanied the players on their trip. The next year the Hogs earned another tournament berth and advanced to the Final Four, losing to eventual champions Oklahoma A&amp;M. The Razorbacks did not make the tournament again until the 1948–49 season, when the Hogs shared the SWC crown with Baylor and Rice. The Hogs lost in the first round of the regional, but won the third place game. The 1948–49 season was Lambert's last season coaching the Hogs. During Lambert's seven seasons, Arkansas won a share the Southwest Conference Championship twice, with three second-place finishes and never fell lower than third in the conference. Lambert's final record was 113–60 (.653).\nPresley Askew (1949–52).\nPresley Askew took over for the 1949–50 season and coached through the 1951–52 season. Arkansas tied for first place in the Southwest Conference in Askew's first season, but bottomed out in his third and final season, posting the program's first losing record of 10–14 (4–8). The Razorbacks did not make the NCAA Tournament during Askew's tenure. Askew's overall record was 35–37 (.486), the first basketball coach to finish his career at Arkansas with a losing record, despite having a winning conference record of 19–17. Askew's three-season tenure is the shortest in Razorback basketball history.\nSecond Glen Rose era (1952–66).\nGlen Rose returned for the 1952–53 season; his second stint with the Hogs lasted until 1966. Rose did not reach the heights of his previous run, with the only real success being in the 1957–58 season, when Arkansas tied for first place in the Southwest Conference with SMU and made the NCAA tournament, losing to an Oklahoma State team whose starting point guard, Eddie Sutton, eventually became head coach of the Razorbacks. Rose's teams in his second spell as head coach posted a winning conference record only five times, to go along with six losing records overall.\nFor the second time in his career as head coach, Rose oversaw a transition from one home court to another. Eighteen years after the transition from \"Schmidt's barn\" to the Men's Gymnasium, the Razorbacks began playing their home games in Barnhill Arena (then known as Razorback Fieldhouse) in the 1955–56 season. With a capacity of 3,500 at the time of the first game, the transition to Razorback Fieldhouse represented more investment and interest in the program, even if the results of Rose's second run with the Hogs were lackluster. The capacity of Razorback Fieldhouse was 5,000 once it was fully completed and remained at that number until 1977. Razorback Fieldhouse would also be the site of the first televised home game for the Hogs, with Rose coaching the Hogs to a 61–57 victory over Texas Tech on January 3, 1959.\nRose finished his second run with the Hogs (fourteen seasons) with a record of 171–154 (.526). Rose's overall record for his time at Arkansas (twenty-three seasons) was 325–201 (.618). Rose's twenty-three seasons as head coach remain the longest tenure of any Razorback basketball coach, and his fourteen continuous seasons as coach from 1952 to 1966 is second only to Nolan Richardson for longest continuous tenure as Razorback basketball coach.\nDecline under Waller and Van Eman (1966–74).\nAfter Glen Rose's teams continually failed to be competitive in the SWC during his second stint as coach, he retired following the 1965–66 season. The next eight years proved to be much worse than the lows experienced under Rose's leadership.\nDuddy Waller became head coach for the 1966–67 season, but only lasted until the 1970–71 season. All of Waller's teams posted losing records, including two of the three worst winning percentages for a season in school history and the second most losses in a season in school history. Waller's record during his four seasons was 31–64, which is the worst overall winning percentage (.326) of any Arkansas basketball coach ever.\nWaller was replaced by Lanny Van Eman, who coached the Hogs from the 1970–71 season through the 1973–74 season. Van Eman started his career as head coach of the Razorbacks with the worst season in school history, a 5–21 (1–13) campaign that still holds the record for most losses in a season, lowest winning percentage for a season, most SWC losses in a season, and fewest conference wins in a season. Despite such an awful first season, Van Eman did manage to lead Arkansas to its first winning conference record in a decade, when the Hogs finished with a 9–5 record in the SWC for the 1972–73 season and tied for second place in the conference. Van Eman finished his career at Arkansas with a 39–65 record (.375).\nDespite the major shortcomings of Waller and Van Eman's teams on the court, of note is the fact that these coaches oversaw the gradual integration of African-American players into the basketball program under their leadership. Thomas A. Johnson was the first African-American to play for the Razorbacks on the 1967 team headed by Waller. Following in the footsteps of Johnson were the first African-American stars of Razorback basketball, guard Martin Terry and center Dean Tolson. Playing under Van Eman, Terry and Tolson put up huge numbers and set school records that still stand today, while also collecting All-SWC and All-American recognition. Terry owns the Arkansas records for highest season and career scoring averages, was a two-time First-Team All-SWC selection in 1972 and 1973, and picked up an All-American Honorable Mention nod from Helms in 1973, the same season he was named Southwest Conference Player of the Year. He was taken in the third round of the 1973 NBA draft, the second-highest pick in Arkansas history at the time. Tolson is the school record holder for single-game field goals made and attempted, as well as career rebounding average. Tolson would follow Terry and get drafted in the fifth round of the 1974 NBA draft.\nArkansas failed to finish above second place in the Southwest Conference during these eight seasons, posting a winning record only once, and did not receive any invitations to the NCAA Tournament. The combined overall record of these two coaches was 70–129 (.352) and 39–73 (.348) in conference play.\nNew heights in the Eddie Sutton era (1974–85).\nAfter coaching at Creighton for five mostly unremarkable seasons that culminated in an NCAA tournament bid and a first round victory, Eddie Sutton found himself on Frank Broyles' radar, as the longtime head football coach and new athletic director wanted to invest in the basketball program to get it out of the depths of the Waller and Van Eman years.\nBroyles hired Sutton starting with the 1974–75 season, and the hire proved to be a turning point in the program's history. Sutton's first campaign with the Hogs turned out to be a mildly successful one that put fans on notice, with an 11–3 conference record that was good for second place in the SWC, as high as the program had finished in conference play in seventeen years. Sutton's second team did not perform as strongly in conference play, but improved its overall record. The excitement behind Razorback basketball was palpable as renovations began on what was then officially Barnhill Arena after it was renamed in 1973 for former athletic director and head football coach, John Barnhill. Sutton's second team also had the core players that would elevate the Razorbacks to a national power under his leadership, the famed in-state players known as the \"Triplets,\" Ron Brewer, Marvin Delph, and Sidney Moncrief (who later became the first player in program history to have his number retired).\nThe 1976–77 Razorbacks were the team that established Arkansas as a basketball power in the modern era. Beginning play in a renovated Barnhill Arena with an expanded capacity of 6,200, the Hogs won the SWC with a perfect 16–0 conference record, going 26–1 overall in the regular season and spent more weeks in the AP Poll that season than every season prior, combined, with a peak ranking of #6. The Hogs earned their first tournament invitation in nearly two decades, but fell in the first round, while still finishing ranked in the AP Poll for the first time in school history. The Hogs would follow the 1976–77 season with Sutton's most successful season at Arkansas and one of the best seasons in school history. Barnhill Arena was expanded further prior to the 1977–78 season, this time to a capacity of 9,000. The Hogs started the season ranked #7 by the AP Poll, and lived up to the high expectations of their recent success by winning their first fourteen games and never falling out of the top ten of the AP Poll the whole season. Arkansas ascended to the top spot in the AP Poll for the first time in program history on February 13, 1978. The Hogs received an at-large bid to the tournament after winning a share of the SWC Championship and beat AP #2 UCLA in the Sweet Sixteen before falling to eventual champion, Kentucky, in the Final Four in St. Louis. The fifth-ranked Hogs won the third place game against AP #6 Notre Dame, 71–69.\nSutton's 1978–79 team still managed a great campaign, despite the loss of two of the \"Triplets,\" All-American Brewer and Delph. Repeating with a share of the Southwest Conference crown, the Hogs won the SWC tournament to clinch the bid to the tournament. The Razorbacks advanced to the Elite Eight, where they lost a close game marred by a controversial last-minute missed tripping call to Larry Bird and undefeated Indiana State, 73–71.\nWhile Sutton's other teams would not be as high achieving as the 1977–78 and 1978–79 squads, he would still coach the Razorbacks to successful seasons, never finishing lower than second in the Southwest Conference standings after his second season, while also producing highlights ranging from U.S. Reed's game-winning, last-second half court shot against defending champions Louisville in the second round of the 1981 NCAA tournament, ending back-to-back national runner-up Houston's thirty-nine game SWC winning streak, having a player drafted in the first round of the NBA draft three straight years from 1983 to 1985 (Darrell Walker, Alvin Robertson, and Joe Kleine), and the Razorbacks' first win over an AP #1 team against Michael Jordan and North Carolina in Pine Bluff, Arkansas on February 12, 1984.\nSutton's eleven seasons remain the third longest tenure in Razorback basketball history. During these eleven seasons, Arkansas won or shared the Southwest Conference Championship four times. The Hogs finished ranked seven times, including four top-ten finishes and two top-five finishes. The Razorbacks were invited to the NCAA Tournament during each of the last nine seasons of Sutton's tenure. Sutton finished with a 260–75 (.776) overall record at Arkansas, including nine NCAA Tournament appearances, four Sweet Sixteen appearances, two Elite Eight appearances, and one Final Four berth.\nNolan Richardson era and a national championship (1985–2002).\nTulsa coach and former Texas Western player Nolan Richardson replaced Sutton beginning with the 1985–86 season. After two years without a winning conference record, Arkansas finished tied for second in the Southwest Conference standings in Richardson's third season. The Razorbacks won the SWC regular season and tournament titles each of its last three seasons in the SWC (1989, 1990, and 1991). Arkansas joined the Southeastern Conference for the 1991–92 season and won the regular season conference championship in 1992 and 1994, also winning the SEC Western Division title in 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995. The Razorbacks also won the 2000 SEC tournament. Arkansas made the NCAA Tournament thirteen times during Richardson's seventeen seasons, and made the Final Four during the 1990, 1994 and 1995 seasons. They won their first national championship in 1994 by beating Duke in the title game. The next season, they returned to the championship game and finished as runner-up, losing to UCLA. Richardson was fired in 2002 after making controversial public statements against the university and then-athletic director Frank Broyles. Assistant coach Mike Anderson coached the rest of the season, going 1–1. Richardson holds the school record for most wins by a head coach, with an overall record of 389–169 (.697). Coach Richardson led Arkansas to four NCAA Tournament Elite Eight appearances (1990, 1991, 1994 and 1995) and six NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen appearances (1990, 1991, 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996). Between the 1989–90 and 1995–96 seasons, Arkansas won more games than any other school in the nation.\nThe Stan Heath Years (2002–07).\nStan Heath coached the Hogs beginning with the 2002–03 season and remained in Fayetteville through the 2006–07 season. During Heath's five seasons, the Razorbacks did not enjoy the success that they achieved under Richardson. They never finished higher than third place in the Western Division of the Southeastern Conference. They were invited to the NCAA Tournament in Heath's final two seasons, although they were eliminated in the Round of 64 each trip. Heath's overall record at Arkansas was 82–71 (.536) with a record of 31–49 (.388) in SEC play. Despite racking up 20 wins and his second consecutive NCAA tournament appearance in his final year of coaching the Razorbacks, Heath was fired after the 2006–07 season.\nDana Altman Day (April 2, 2007).\nCreighton University head coach, Dana Altman was hired as the head coach of the Arkansas Razorbacks on April 2, 2007. During his introductory press conference, a visibly apprehensive Altman struggled to join in the Hog Call, stating afterwards, \"I'm not sure my friends in Omaha would like to see me do that.\" This was a sure sign of things to come, as the following day Altman claimed that he had a change of heart and immediately resigned, returning to Creighton where he had coached since 1994.\nJohn Pelphrey (2007–11).\nJohn Pelphrey was hired as the head coach of the Arkansas Razorbacks on Monday, April 9, 2007. Arkansas went 23–12 in Pelphrey's first season, defeating Indiana by 14 points in the first round of the NCAA Tournament before being put away by overall #1 seed North Carolina in the second round. The Razorbacks had an SEC regular season record of 9–7. In Pelphrey's second year, the Razorbacks struggled in conference play after starting the season 12–1 in non-conference games with two notable wins over the nationally ranked Oklahoma Sooners (#4) and the Texas Longhorns (#7). Conference wins were few and far between giving the Razorbacks a final conference record of 2–14. On March 13, 2011, John Pelphrey was dismissed as the head coach of the Razorbacks after an 18–13 season in which the Hogs missed postseason play for the third consecutive season, despite an impressive incoming recruiting class. Pelphrey finished his career at Arkansas with a record of 69–59 (.539).\nMike Anderson (2011–19).\nOn March 23, 2011, Mike Anderson signed a 7-year contract with Arkansas. Anderson previously coached the UAB Blazers and Missouri Tigers, and had already been an assistant coach at Arkansas under coach Nolan Richardson for 17 years. On March 26, 2011, Anderson was introduced in front of 5,000 fans in Bud Walton Arena. Anderson made three NCAA tournaments in his eight seasons, including a 27-win season in 2014–15 that resulted in a 5 seed in the tournament, the program's highest since 1999. The Razorbacks made another tournament two years later but lost to top-seeded North Carolina, the eventual national champion, in the second round. The following year saw them make the tournament for the final time in Anderson's tenure at Arkansas, but a loss to Butler ended the Hogs' season in the first round. Following an up-and-down 2018–19 campaign that culminated in an NIT berth, new athletic director Hunter Yurachek relieved Anderson of his duties on March 26 a little over a week after Arkansas lost to Indiana in the second round of the NIT. Anderson finished his career at Arkansas with a record of 170–103 (.623), including his 1–1 record as interim coach in 2002.\nEric Musselman era and a return to national prominence (2019–24).\nOn April 7, 2019, Yurachek announced the hiring of Eric Musselman, then the four-year head coach at the University of Nevada. Musselman had previously coached in the NBA with the Sacramento Kings and the Golden State Warriors, where he was runner up for the NBA Coach of the Year Award, as well as college assistant coaching stops at Arizona State and LSU. Musselman's first Arkansas team finished the season with a record of 20–12, with Musselman becoming only the second coach in school history to finish his first season with at least 20 wins and the first since John Pelphrey in 2007–08. Musselman was also only the second head coach at Arkansas to finish his debut season with a winning percentage above 61% since Gene Lambert during the 1942–43 season. After Arkansas beat Vanderbilt in the first round of the 2020 SEC Basketball Tournament, the rest of the SEC Tournament, as well as the entire NCAA tournament, was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, making this the final Southeastern Conference men's basketball game of the 2019–2020 season. Arkansas junior guard Mason Jones was named the SEC Co-Player of the Year by the AP.\nIn only his second year, Musselman led the Razorbacks to the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament, losing to eventual champion Baylor. This was Arkansas's deepest postseason run since their 1995 title game appearance. The team finished the 2021 season with a record of 25–7 (.781), and a conference record of 13–4 (.765). Freshman guard Moses Moody was named the SEC Freshman of the Year, and became the first \"one-and-done\" player in program history when he was drafted in the first round (14th overall) of the 2021 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors. Arkansas advanced further in the NCAA Tournament than any other Southeastern Conference team, and finished with an overall ranking of #6 in the USA Today Coaches Poll. In his third year, Musselman led the Razorbacks to the Elite Eight again, losing to the Duke Blue Devils. Arkansas finished the 2022 season with a record of 28–9 (.757), and a conference record of 13–5 (.722). Again, Arkansas advanced further in the NCAA tournament than any other Southeastern Conference team, and finished with a ranking of #8 in the Coaches Poll, the highest in the SEC. Arkansas also won the early season Hall of Fame Classic tournament championship. In his fourth year, Musselman signed the #2 recruiting class in the nation, but the team slipped in SEC-play, finishing 8–10. The team would recover late in the season and made it to their third consecutive Sweet 16, losing to eventual national champion, UCONN. Musselman started his fifth season as head coach with a 9–4 record through the non-conference portion of the schedule, which saw the Razorbacks upset ranked opponents Duke and Purdue. The conference schedule proved a little tougher, as the squad began SEC play with a 1–5 record. The Hogs would continue to show very few signs of cohesive play, teamwork, or overall leadership, finishing the season with a record of 16–17, including a lackluster 6–12 record in SEC play.\nOn April 4, 2024, Eric Musselman officially left Arkansas to take the vacant head coaching position at USC.\nThe John Calipari era (2024– ).\nOn April 10, 2024, Naismith Hall of Fame coach John Calipari, who had stepped down as head coach of Kentucky the day prior, was officially hired as the head coach of the Arkansas Razorbacks.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Razorbacks have appeared in the NCAA tournament 35 times. Their combined record is 50–35. They were National Champions in 1994.\nNIT results.\nThe Razorbacks have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) four times. Their combined record is 6–5.\nArkansas's All-Americans.\nRetired numbers.\nThe University of Arkansas athletic department has seen fit to retire only two jersey numbers in honor of former outstanding players:\nMoncrief (6'4\" 190 lbs.) led the Razorbacks to the 1978 Final Four and is, so far, Arkansas' only Consensus 1st team All-American player (1979). Moncrief also led the Hogs to three straight Southwest Conference regular season titles from 1977 to 1979, as well as the 1977 and 1979 SWC Tournament championships. He was a three-time All-SWC performer, and was also the SWC Player of the Year in 1979. Moncrief finished his career as the school's all-time leading scorer, until his record was broken in 1992.\nWilliamson (6'7\" 245 lbs.) led Arkansas to the 1994 National Championship and a runner-up finish in the 1995 Final Four. Corliss also lead Arkansas to three straight SEC West Division championships from 1993 to 1995, plus the 1994 SEC regular season title. Williamson was a two-time All-SEC performer, was the 1994 and 1995 SEC Player of the Year, and was named Consensus 2nd team All-American in both seasons."

        "title": "Florida Gators men's basketball",
        "text": "The Florida Gators men's basketball team represents the University of Florida in the sport of basketball. The Gators compete in NCAA Division I's Southeastern Conference (SEC). Home games are played in the Exactech Arena at the Stephen C. O'Connell Center on the university's Gainesville, Florida campus.\nWhile the University of Florida's men's basketball team first took the court in 1915, the program did not receive much support from the university for several decades. The basketball team did not have a permanent home court with adequate spectator space until the Florida Gymnasium opened in 1949, did not hire a full-time basketball coach until Norm Sloan in 1960, and did not play in a modern arena until the O'Connell Center opened in 1980. Early highlights included the program's first postseason appearance in the 1969 National Invitation Tournament with the Gators' first All-American Neal Walk, a run to the Sweet Sixteen during its first NCAA tournament appearance in 1987 under head coach Norm Sloan, and another surprise tournament run to the 1994 Final Four under head coach Lon Kruger. However, consistent success was elusive, and the Gators often found themselves in the bottom half of the SEC basketball standings.\nThe trajectory of Florida's basketball program changed with the hiring of head coach Billy Donovan in 1996. After having made five NCAA Tournament appearances and having won only one regular season SEC championship and zero SEC tournaments in 78 seasons of basketball before his arrival, the Gators won seven SEC regular season championships and four SEC tournament championships, appeared in 14 NCAA Tournaments, reached four Final Fours, and won back-to-back national championships (2006 and 2007) during Donovan's 19 seasons in Gainesville before he left to coach in the NBA in 2015.\nTodd Golden became the Gators' head basketball coach in March 2022.\nSchedule overview.\nThe college basketball season begins in early November, and the non-conference portion of the schedule typically runs until the end of the calendar year. The Gators usually compete in a cross-regional tournament against other top programs, schedule a game or two against other quality opponents in Gainesville or on the road, and play their annual game against in-state rival Florida State before the conference portion of the schedule begins.\nThe 18-game Southeastern Conference (SEC) slate usually tips off around the beginning of the calendar year. The schedule consists of home-and-home games against five SEC teams mixed in with single games against each of the other eight SEC teams followed by the conference tournament. Florida has built in-conference rivalries with Kentucky and Tennessee since the Gators began consistently competing for conference titles in the 1990s.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe modern University of Florida (UF) was created when the Florida Legislature passed the Buckman Act of 1905, which consolidated four predecessor institutions into a new flagship university that opened its new Gainesville campus in 1906. The school sponsored its first varsity basketball team during the 1915–16 school year under head football coach C. J. McCoy, who led the basketball team to a 5–1 record against small colleges and local athletic clubs. The program went on hiatus during World War I and next took the court during the 1919–20 school year, though without an officially designated coach. Head football coach William G. Kline was assigned to coach basketball during the 1920–21 school year, when the team moved into their new home at recently completed University Gymnasium.\nThe \"New Gym\" and Alligator Alley.\nBy the mid-1920s, the basketball team had outgrown the small brick University Gymnasium, which had been designed to serve as a student recreation center and had very little spectator space. A larger wooden structure was built directly adjacent to the University Gym in 1928. While it was officially known as \"Building R\", it was commonly called the \"New Gym.\" The New Gym was intended to be a temporary home for the basketball team until the school could afford a more permanent structure. However, funds soon became scarce with the coming of the Great Depression, and university president John J. Tigert's main focus was the financing and construction of Florida Field, the new football stadium which opened in 1930. Plans for a larger brick gymnasium were drawn up in 1940, but construction was delayed by World War II, and the Gators finally moved to the Florida Gymnasium (also known as Alligator Alley) during the 1949–50 season.\nSoutheastern Conference membership.\nIn December 1932, the University of Florida joined the Southeastern Conference as one of its 13 charter members. While the school would find athletic success in some sports, Florida's basketball team would spend most of the first half-century of SEC play in the bottom half of the standings, as the Gators finished the season higher than fourth in the league on only four occasions over the program's first fifty years in the SEC (1933 to 1983). Until 1960, the university continued the practice of assigning coaches from other sports to lead the basketball team, including head baseball coaches Brady Cowell, Ben Clemons and Sam McAllister, head football coach Josh Cody, and football assistants Spurgeon Cherry and John Mauer. This was common practice at most SEC schools apart from Kentucky well into the 1940s and 1950s, and some of Florida's coaches had experience in the sport, as Cody had previously coached basketball at Clemson and Vanderbilt and Mauer had previously coached basketball at Kentucky and Tennessee. However, none of these part-time coaches were able to build the Gators into consistent contenders in conference play.\nThe 1960s and 1970s: Sloan and some success.\nIn hopes of breathing life into the program, 34-year-old Citadel head coach Norm Sloan was hired as Florida's first full-time head basketball coach for the 1960–61 season. Sloan's first team notched the Gators' first winning conference record in eight years, and his second repeated the feat. Overall, his Florida squads compiled a record of 85–63 in six seasons during the 1960s, including the Gators' first regular season win over long-dominant Kentucky in SEC play. Sloan's Gators did not receive a postseason tournament invitation during his tenure, as tournament fields were smaller at the time and only conference champions were assured of NCAA bids. Nonetheless, according to Florida historian Norm Carlson, Sloan \"elevated the Gators basketball program from a seldom competitive program and built the grass roots.\" Sloan left Florida after failing to receive the support of then athletic director Ray Graves, and took over as head coach at his alma mater North Carolina State after the 1965–66 season.\nTommy Bartlett succeeded Sloan as head coach, and his first season as head coach in 1966–67 was the program's most successful to date. The Gators with a record of 21–4, finishing 2nd in the SEC to Tennessee, who beat them twice during the regular season. Florida was ranked in the AP top 10 for the first time, earning a number 10 ranking on January 9, 1967, and then a number 8 ranking the next week on January 16. Florida notched the school's first 20-win campaign on the strength of winning their final eight games of the year by an average of 19 plus points per game. Ironically at the time the SEC would only permit the league champion to play in the postseason. Having finished second, they lost to league champion Tennessee twice and were not invited to a postseason tournament. Bartlett's squads finished fifth and third in conference play the following seasons. Led by the program's first All-American in center Neal Walk (the only Gator to have his number retired) and forward Andy Owens, the 1968–69 Gators received a bid to the 1969 National Invitation Tournament, the first postseason appearance in program history. After Walk and Owens went on to play professional basketball, Bartlett could not sustain the level of talent in recruiting, and team performance declined thereafter, with four straight losing campaigns leading to his dismissal. John Lotz, a respected assistant under North Carolina's Dean Smith, succeeded Bartlett in 1973–74. Lotz's Gators peaked with a 17–9 overall record and a fourth-place conference finish (10–8 SEC) in 1976–77, but trailed off to consecutive last place conference finishes in 1978–79 and 1979–80, leading to his dismissal.\nThe 1980s: Sloan returns, success and scandal.\nThe modern era of Florida basketball began in 1980, when the team moved into their current home, the O'Connell Center. Despite being only 30 years old, Florida Gym had not aged well. By the mid-1970s, Florida was the only basketball program in the SEC without a modern arena. The university built the O'Connell Center (which quickly gained the nickname \"The O'Dome\") as the new home for all of the university's indoor sports programs, and it proved to be a boon across several sports.\nThe new facility improved the basketball program in several ways, including helping to convince Norm Sloan to return to Gainesville after a successful 14-year tenure at North Carolina State which included an undefeated season in 1972–73 and an NCAA championship in 1974. Sloan later said that he'd always enjoyed his first stint at Florida, and had always been more than willing to return if the university built a more modern arena.\nSloan's second stint at Florida was easily the most successful period in program history until the late 1990s. That success was in large part because Sloan persuaded several top Florida high school basketball players—such as Gainesville's Vernon Maxwell and Brandon's Dwayne Schintzius—to stay in-state instead of attending schools with more basketball tradition. After four years of rebuilding, Sloan led the Gators to the 1984 NIT, which was only the second postseason appearance in school history. They would make the NIT again in 1985 and 1986, reaching the NIT semi-finals in 1986. In 1987, shooting guard Vernon Maxwell led the team to the school's first ever NCAA Tournament appearance, advancing all the way to the Sweet 16. Sloan coached the team to 20-win seasons and NCAA tournament appearances again the following two years, and led the Gators to the school's first-ever SEC regular season title in 1989 behind center Dwayne Schintzius.\nHowever, after a drug scandal involving Maxwell and an NCAA investigation for various rules violations, Sloan and his coaching staff were forced to resign on October 31, 1989, just days before the start of the 1989–90 season. Former Tennessee coach Don DeVoe was brought in as the interim coach, but the defending SEC champions struggled to a 7–21 record. In September 1990, the NCAA sentenced the program to two years' probation for numerous major violations dating back to 1985. Their 1987 and 1988 NCAA Tournament appearances were erased from the record books due to Maxwell being retroactively declared ineligible for secretly taking money from a sports agent, and Sloan was slapped with a five-year show-cause penalty that effectively ended his coaching career. The most severe penalty in the long run, however, was a reduction to 13 total scholarships in 1991–92 and 14 in 1992–93, which affected the program for several years. Draconian as those penalties were, the NCAA said that it would have banned the Gators from postseason play and live television in 1990–91 had Sloan still been coach.\nLon Kruger era.\nLon Kruger, former head coach at Kansas State, took over the program before the 1990–91 season. Despite the probation he inherited, Kruger slowly brought the team to increased success and reached the NIT semifinals in his second year as coach. In 1993–94, the pieces fell into place for Florida to have their best season ever at that time. Behind Andrew DeClercq and Dametri Hill, the Gators went to their first Final Four following a dramatic victory over UConn where Donyell Marshall missed two free throws with no time on the clock to force overtime, where the Gators eventually prevailed. They lost to Duke in the national semifinal, 70–65. The next year, they returned to the NCAA tournament, but were eliminated in the first round. Kruger's final season in 1995–1996 resulted in a losing record, and he left to coach at Illinois.\nBilly Donovan era.\nFlorida's Athletic Director, Jeremy Foley, looking for a young coach with a proven track record, hired 30-year-old Billy Donovan, then at Marshall, as Kruger's replacement. His recruiting prowess was evident early, bringing future NBA star Jason Williams with him from Marshall and having early recruiting classes with future NBA players Mike Miller, Udonis Haslem, and Matt Bonner, among others. The Gators made the NCAA tournament every year from 1999 to 2007, a nine-year streak that is the school record, and the sixth-longest NCAA Tournament streak.\nRebuilding to a Final Four.\nDonovan's first two seasons at Florida proved to be the two worst during his tenure at Florida. The Gators posted a two-year win–loss record of 27–32, missing postseason play entirely in his first season, and losing in the first round of the NIT in his second season. These were the last losing records that the Gators suffered until 2014–15.\nIn his third season, however, Donovan's Gators finished the season with an overall record of 22–9, and earned the No. 6 seed in the West Regional of the 1999 NCAA tournament. The Gators defeated Penn and Weber State to advance to the Sweet Sixteen in Phoenix, where they were upset by No. 10 seed Gonzaga.\nDonovan took his Gators on a memorable run during his fourth season in Gainesville. The Gators finished the season 29–8, including winning a share of the SEC championship. In the 2000 SEC tournament, however, the Gators were upset in the second round by Auburn. Florida received the No. 5 seed in the East Regional of the 2000 NCAA tournament, and swept through the region by beating Butler, Illinois, Duke, and Oklahoma State to reach the Final Four. In the national semifinals, Florida knocked off North Carolina to advance to their first NCAA national championship game, before losing to heavily favored and top seeded Michigan State.\nOver the next five years the Gators went to the NCAA Tournament every year, but they found themselves upset victims five straight times in the first or second round. In the 2001 NCAA tournament, Florida received the No. 3 seed in the South Region. They defeated No. 14 Western Kentucky in the first round, but they were then upset by the No. 11 seed, Temple.\nThe following year, in 2002, the Gators received the No. 5 seed in the Midwest Region of the 2002 NCAA tournament. They were knocked off in the first round by No. 12 seed Creighton. The 2003 Florida Gators finished the season 24–7, and received the No. 2 seed in the South Region of the 2003 NCAA tournament. The Gators easily defeated Sam Houston State in the first round, but were then upset by No. 7 seed Michigan State in the second round. In 2004, the Gators were the No. 5 seed in the East Rutherford Regional of the 2003–2004 NCAA tournament, but were upset in the first round by the No. 12 seed, Manhattan.\nThe 2004–05 team had the distinction of being the first to garner an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament, when it defeated Kentucky in the 2005 SEC tournament championship. The Gators subsequently received the No. 4 seed in the Syracuse Regional of the 2004–2005 NCAA tournament. They knocked off the No. 13 seed, Ohio in the first round, but lost to No. 5 seed Villanova in the second round.\n2005–06 NCAA national championship season.\nThe 2005–06 team began the season unranked and went on a 17–0 winning streak for the best start in school history, surprising many with a young (four sophomores and one junior) squad following the graduation of David Lee and the departures of Matt Walsh and Anthony Roberson to the NBA. The trio accounted for 60 percent of their offense in 2005. The team faded late in the regular season, losing its last 3 games in February and entering the postseason with a 24–6 record, yet still managed to win its second consecutive SEC tournament championship.\nThe Gators entered the 2006 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as a No. 3 seed with a 27–6 record, and ranked No. 10 by the AP. They beat No. 14 seed South Alabama and No. 11 seed Milwaukee to advance to the Minneapolis regional. There, the Gators defeated the No. 7 seed Georgetown Hoyas and upset the No. 1 seed Villanova Wildcats 75–62 to avenge their loss in the previous year's tournament and move on to their second Final Four under Donovan.\nFlorida defeated the upstart George Mason Patriots, the No. 11 seed from the Washington, D.C. regional, by a score of 73–58 in the national semifinals in Indianapolis. On April 3, 2006, the Gators defeated the UCLA Bruins 73–57 in the national final to win the school's first men's basketball NCAA Championship. The University of Florida Athletic Association then purchased the floor used in Indianapolis for the Final Four, and installed it in the O'Connell Center.\n2006–07 NCAA national championship season.\nThe Gators returned all five starters from their 2006 championship team to begin the 2006–07 basketball season ranked as the preseason No. 1 in both major media polls, a first for the Gators. The Gators locked up the SEC Championship relatively early in the 2006–07 season and were in possession of a 24–2 record before going on a late-February 1–3 skid that mirrored their 0–3 run a year earlier. For the second season in a row, the losses in February would be their last. Florida closed out Kentucky on Senior Night to end the regular season 26–5, and won their third straight SEC tournament championship with relative ease, beating , , and Arkansas 77–56.\nFlorida entered the 2007 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as the No. 1 overall seed in the tournament, and they advanced to the Final Four after wins in the regional against No. 5 seed Butler and No. 3 seed Oregon. In a rematch of the 2006 title game, the Gators again eliminated the UCLA Bruins in the national semifinal. Florida defeated the Ohio State Buckeyes 84–75, in a rematch of a game they won 86–60 three months earlier, to become the first team since the 1991–92 Duke Blue Devils to win back-to-back national championships and the first college team ever to repeat as national champions with the same starting line-up. The University of Florida also has the distinction of being the only school in NCAA history to have won both the basketball and football national championships in the same season (won the football championship in January 2007, which was the 2006 season) and the only school in NCAA history to win a combined four national championships in three seasons (football in 2006 and 2008 and basketball in 2006 and 2007).\nFollowing the 2006–07 season, three of the Gators' starting five were drafted among the first ten picks in the first round of the 2007 NBA draft: Al Horford (third), Corey Brewer (seventh) and Joakim Noah (ninth). Taurean Green and Chris Richard were both selected in the second round. Also during this season, Donovan passed Sloan as the winningest coach in school history.\n2008–2010: Rebuilding.\nIn the aftermath of the Gators second NCAA championship, Donovan accepted the head coaching position for the NBA's Orlando Magic on May 31, 2007. On June 3, however, it was disclosed that Donovan asked to be released from his contract with the Magic, which was announced when he was reintroduced as the Gators head coach on June 7.\nThe Gators failed to qualify for the NCAA Tournament in 2008 and 2009. The Gators were eliminated by UMass in the semi-finals of the 2008 National Invitation Tournament. The following season, the Gators were eliminated by Penn State in a quarter-final game of the 2009 National Invitation Tournament. In 2010, the Gators received an invitation to the 2010 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as a No. 10 seed, but they were eliminated in the first round by No. 7 seed BYU in double overtime.\n2011–2013: Three straight Elite Eight appearances.\nIn the 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, the Gators were the No. 2 seed in the Southeast region after winning the SEC Championship, after being defeated in the 2011 SEC men's basketball tournament championship game to Kentucky, and finishing with a 26–7 record. They played their two first games in Tampa, Florida. In the Second Round of the Tournament, Florida beat No. 15 seed, UC Santa Barbara Gauchos. In the third round, the Gators defeated the No. 7 seed, the UCLA Bruins to advance to the Sweet Sixteen in New Orleans. On March 24, 2011, the Gators got some revenge by defeating the No. 3 seed, BYU, who had knocked them out of the NCAA Tournament the year before, by a score of 83–74 in overtime to advance to the Elite Eight for the first time since 2007. Their tournament run ended there as they were stunned in the Regional Final against No. 8 seed Butler in overtime.\nIn the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, the Gators were the No. 7 seed in the West Region after losing in the 2012 SEC men's basketball tournament semifinals to Kentucky, finishing with an overall record of 23–10. Florida defeated the No. 10 seed, Virginia, and the No. 15 seed, Norfolk State, to advance to the Sweet 16 in Phoenix. They defeated No. 3 seed Marquette in an upset to advance to the Elite Eight, but their run ended when they were defeated by the No. 4 seed, Louisville, 72–68, after blowing a 65–54 lead with 8:14 remaining in the game.\nThe 2012–13 Gators finished the regular season with an overall record of 24–6, and won the SEC Championship with a conference record of 14–4. During the regular season, Billy Donovan notched his 400th career win as the head coach of the Gators over Missouri. After losing in the final of the 2013 SEC men's basketball tournament to Mississippi, they entered the 2013 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as the No. 3 seed in the South Region. Florida defeated the No. 14 seed Northwestern State 79–47 in the first round, and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen after soundly beating the No. 11 seed, Minnesota, 78–64. The Gators then defeated Florida Gulf Coast, No. 15 seed, in the Sweet Sixteen 62–50. But once again, their run ended in the Elite Eight, this time against fourth seeded Michigan, who handily defeated the Gators, 79–59. The Gators became the first team since the expansion of the tournament in 1951 to lose in the Elite Eight in three consecutive seasons.\nFlorida is the only program in the nation to have advanced as far as the Elite Eight in each of those seasons from 2011 to 2013.\n2014: Return to Final Four.\nThe 2013–14 Gators finished the SEC regular season with an 18–0 record in conference play, the first SEC team to ever accomplish the feat, after the SEC re-expanded to an 18-game regular season schedule prior to the 2012–13 season. In doing so, the Gators won their seventh SEC championship, and their third in four seasons. The Gators then beat the Kentucky Wildcats for the third time in the season to claim their fourth SEC Tournament championship title.\nBy claiming the SEC tournament, the Gators earned an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, and were selected as the No.1 overall seed, and were placed in the South Regional. The Gators' school record win streak reached 30 as they defeated their first four tournament opponents by double digits, finally breaking through in the Elite 8 with a 62–52 win over Dayton to advance to the Final Four as the only remaining No.1 seed. In the national semifinals, Florida faced Connecticut, which had been the last team to defeat them back on December 2, 64–65. The Gators got off to a quick start and built a 16–4 lead, but the Huskies were able to catch up and led 25–22 at halftime in a defensive battle. The Gators continued to struggle to score in the second half and suffered their third (and worst) loss of the season, 53–63.\nThe team's program-best 36–3 record resulted in many individual honors. Billy Donovan was named the SEC's Coach of the Year for the third time. Senior point guard Scottie Wilbekin was named Southeastern Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year, the SEC Tournament MVP, and the Most Outstanding Player of the NCAA South region. Senior center Patric Young was named the Defensive Player and Scholar-Athlete of the Year, junior forward Dorian Finney-Smith was named Sixth Man of the Year, and senior guard Casey Prather was named to the All-SEC First Team.\n2015: First losing record in 17 years.\nThe 2014–15 Gators finished the season 16–17, 8–10 in SEC play to finish in a tie for eighth place. They did not participate in a postseason tournament for the first time in 17 years. The woeful season included losses to in-state rivals Miami and Florida State, and three losses to SEC champion Kentucky. The Gators' 63.7 points-per-game were their lowest in the 19-year coaching tenure of Billy Donovan. After the season, Donovan accepted an offer to coach the NBA's Oklahoma City Thunder. He would leave Florida as far and away the winningest coach in program history. He led the Gators to 14 NCAA tournament appearances, six SEC regular season titles (four outright, two shared) and four SEC Tournament championships–in all three cases, more than all other coaches in program history combined.\nMike White era.\nOn May 7, 2015, former Louisiana Tech head coach Mike White was hired to coach the Gators, succeeding Billy Donovan. White played point guard at Ole Miss and later served as an assistant there for seven seasons. He is a native of the state of Florida and had led Louisiana Tech to three straight conference titles.\nIn his first season at the helm, he led Florida to a 21–15 record and a berth in the NIT Tournament, defeating North Florida and Ohio State in the first two rounds before losing to eventual-NIT champion George Washington in the quarterfinal. White's second Gator squad was the best of his tenure, as Florida went 24–7, finished 2nd in the SEC standings, and earned a #4 seed in the 2017 NCAA tournament. They reached the Elite Eight on a three-point buzzer beater by guard Chris Chiozza to beat Wisconsin, then were upset one game short of the Final Four by SEC rival South Carolina, 77–70.\nFlorida earned invitations to four straight NCAA tournaments and won at least one game in each appearance under White (not counting the 2020 NCAA tournament, which was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic). However, after 2017, they earned a decreasing number of wins each season, were never a serious contender for SEC championships, and had a 10–15 record in games played in March. After a disappointing 2021-22 season in which Florida did not earn a berth in the NCAA tournament, White left to become the head coach at Georgia.\nTodd Golden era.\nOn March 18, former San Francisco head coach Todd Golden was named Florida's new head basketball coach.\nChampionships.\nNCAA national championships.\nThe Florida Gators have won two NCAA national championships, which is tied for 9th all-time among Division I schools. The Gators won two national championships in 2005–06, and 2006–07 under Billy Donovan. That was the first time any team had won back-to-back national championships since Duke did it in 1991–92, and no Division I men's team has accomplished this since. In addition, the Gators became the first school to ever win a national championship in football and basketball in both the same calendar year and the same academic year (the Gators' football team defeated Ohio State in the 2007 BCS National Championship Game).\nSEC Tournament championships.\nThe Gators have won four SEC Tournament championships, all under Billy Donovan, including three in a row from 2005 to 2007.\nSEC Championships.\nThough the automatic berth in the NCAA Tournament is given to the conference tournament winner, the SEC declares the team with the best record in the regular season the \"official\" conference champion. The Gators have won a total of seven official (regular season) SEC championships. Norm Sloan won the first one during the 1988–89 season, and Billy Donovan has won the other six, including the 2006–07 season in which the Gators also won the SEC Tournament championship and NCAA national championship, and three in a four-year span from 2011 to 2014.\nThe 2013–14 squad became the first team in SEC history to have an 18–0 regular season conference record.\nComplete postseason results.\nNCAA tournament results.\nFlorida has appeared in the NCAA tournament 23 times. Their combined record is 48–20. However, their appearances in 1987 and 1988 have been vacated by the NCAA making their official record 45–18. They were NCAA National Champions in 2006 and 2007.\nNCAA Tournament seeding history.\n\"The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\"\nNIT results.\nThe Gators have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 12 times. Their combined record is 14–14.\nFinal Fours.\nThe Florida Gators have been to five Final Fours, which is tied for 17th all time among Division I schools.\nLon Kruger took the Gators to their first one in 1994. Florida received the No.3 seed in the East Region (played in Miami). The Gators swept through the region with victories over 14th seeded James Madison, 11th seeded Pennsylvania, 2nd seeded Connecticut and punched their ticket to their first ever Final Four by knocking off the upstart, 9th seeded Boston College. But the Gators then lost to Duke in the national semifinals.\nBilly Donovan took them back six years later in 2000, winning the East Region (played in Syracuse, New York) as the No.5 seed. To get to the Final Four, Florida first had to survive a tough test from 12th seeded Butler in the first round in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Trailing 68–67 with time running out, the Gators won on a last second shot by Mike Miller. After that initial test, Florida ran through the rest of the region, easily defeating 4th seeded Illinois, top seeded Duke, and 3rd seeded Oklahoma State to reach the Final Four, where they defeated North Carolina in the semifinals, but lost to Michigan State in the national championship game.\nDonovan would get Florida back to the Final Four in 2006, winning the Minneapolis Regional as the No.3 seed with victories over 14th seeded South Alabama, 11th seeded UW-Milwaukee, 7th seeded Georgetown and top seeded Villanova in the Regional Final. The Gators proceeded to knock off upstart George Mason (who won the Washington, D.C. Regional as the No.11 seed) in the semifinals and then handily defeated UCLA in the championship game for their first ever national championship.\nThe next year, Donovan's Gators would make it not only back to back Final Fours, but back to back national championships as well. They received the top seed in the St. Louis Regional, and defeated 16th seeded Jackson State, 9th seeded Purdue, 5th seeded Butler and 3rd seeded Oregon in the Regional Final to earn a trip to their 4th Final Four. There, they dispatched UCLA in the semifinals and then Ohio State in the title game.\nOver the next decade, Florida reached the doorstep of the Final Four several times but were usually turned away. From 2011 to 2014, the Gators made four consecutive trips to the Elite Eight. Florida held late leads in the first two of them, but could never finish the game and lost each time, first to Butler, then to Louisville, before Michigan blew them out in their third straight Elite 8. Florida finally broke through against Dayton in their fourth straight Regional final appearance and moved on to play eventual 2014 national champions Connecticut in the Final Four, where they were defeated 63–53. After a two-year absence from the NCAA Tournament, Mike White got them back to the Elite Eight in 2017, where the Gators were again defeated, this time by SEC rival South Carolina.\nAll-Americans.\nFlorida Gators basketball players who have been recognized as All-Americans include:\nSEC Player of the Year.\nTwo Florida Gators have been recognized as the SEC Player of the Year:\nRetired numbers.\nFlorida has retired one jersey number.\n2006–07 NCAA championship starting five.\nDonovan's 2004 recruiting class won two consecutive NCAA championships in 2006 and 2007. The group nicknamed themselves \"the 04s\" (pronounced \"oh-fours\") since they enrolled at Florida in 2004. They were known for their camaraderie on and off the court, as Brewer, Green, Horford and Noah were roommates during their entire time in college. All five starters and sixth man Chris Richard later played professionally. All of them, except Humphrey, were selected in the 2007 NBA draft. Brewer, Horford and Noah were selected in the top 10, while Richard and Green were selected in the second-round."

The Golden Ball to the Best Player was given to Nigerian Sani Emmanuel; the Golden Shoe for top scorer was given to Spaniard Borja, with five goals (although he tied with Nigerian Sani Emmanuel, Uruguayan Sebastián Gallegos, and Swiss Haris Seferovic); the Golden Glove was given to Swiss Benjamin Siegrist; finally, the FIFA Fair Play Award was given to Nigeria.\nPlayer eligibility.\nTo be eligible to play, a player must have been born on or after 1 January 1992.\nVenues.\nFIFA chose eight venues out of nine possible locations.\nOn 21 May 2009, FIFA gave Nigeria a \"Yellow Card\" as FIFA noted a significant delay in the preparations for the tournament. While Abuja and Lagos were ready, FIFA vice-president Jack Warner gave four other venues (Enugu, Calabar, Ijebu-Ode and Kano) a month to get 100 percent ready or the tournament would be moved. One potential venue (Warri) was removed after recent violence flared up in the Niger Delta.\nThreats to the tournament.\nThe 2009 edition was under increasing threats from the armed rebel group The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) and warned FIFA against hosting the tournament in Nigeria.

        "text": "Dana Grey Kirk (July 23, 1935 – February 15, 2010) was an American college basketball coach. He was the head coach for the Memphis State University (now the University of Memphis) men's team from 1979 to 1986. His coaching record was 158–58, including a Final Four appearance in 1985. He had previously been the head coach at Virginia Commonwealth University from 1976 to 1979 with a record of 57–23 and the University of Tampa from 1966 to 1971, with a record of 68–59, (.535). Following his stint at Tampa, he was an assistant coach for Denny Crum at the University of Louisville.\nMemphis State.\nKirk built the Tigers into a national powerhouse with teams consisting largely of Memphis-area players. However, he only graduated six players in seven years, including only two on the celebrated 1985 team. Only a year after the Final Four appearance, it was revealed that Memphis State had committed many severe recruiting violations while Kirk was head coach. In addition, Kirk himself was arrested on felony charges following an investigation.\nIndictment.\nIn 1986, the NCAA forced Memphis State to vacate all of their NCAA tournament appearances from 1982 until 1985. Kirk was indicted by a federal Grand Jury on 11 counts of tax evasion, filing false income tax returns, mail fraud and obstruction of justice. At his trial, witnesses testified that he scalped tickets for as much as five times face value, took money from boosters to give to players and actively solicited kickbacks from tournament promoters. He served four months in a federal minimum-security prison in Montgomery, Alabama. After serving out his sentence, he returned to Memphis where he hosted a sports talk show on WHBQ (AM). He has also published his autobiography \"Simply Amazing, The Dana Kirk Story\", written with Dallas talk show host and columnist Mark Davis, who was at WHBQ at the time.\nRetirement.\nHe retired and lived in Memphis, Tennessee with his wife Denise McCrary, a successful attorney. If asked about any of the happenings surrounding his Memphis State years, he would only respond \"I don't do negativity\". Dana Kirk died of a heart attack at Methodist University Hospital in Memphis on February 15, 2010."

It is played with the same rules as regular basketball, with the following exceptions:\nToday, nearly all women's basketball leagues (pro, college, and high school) play by the same basic five-on-five rules as men, with only minor differences such as size of the ball and the distance of the three-point line. In the United States, the last major sanctioning bodies to abandon the six-on-six variant were the high school state athletic organizations of Iowa and Oklahoma. The sport is still occasionally seen at the recreational level, such as during physical education classes; in these cases, both boys and girls play the game.\nLast six-on-six games played.\nBeginning in 1958 the Office of Civil Rights started looking at banning six-on-six high school girls basketball. It would take 37 years to phase it out.\nNew Jersey variation.\nUntil 1975, New Jersey also played 6-on-6 for girls High School basketball, however the rules were slightly different. In New Jersey, two players were offense only, two defense only and two were able to move freely on both offensive and defensive ends. Defense or offense only players could not move beyond their respective midcourts. In general, the best athletes were those playing both ends of the courts, while offense would usually have both an inside (big) player and an outside shooter type. Defense only players were usually taller players and used for rebounding purposes only.\nAt the time New Jersey played 6-on-6 basketball, the game was primarily played in parochial schools. Among the powerhouse teams of the 1960s and early '70s were Mother Seton, Paramus Catholic, St. Vincent's Academy, St. Aloysius, Benedictine Academy and East Orange Catholic High Schools\nLegacy.\nSix-on-six basketball has been chronicled in such media as the 2004 book \"The Only Dance in Iowa: A History of Six-Player Girls' Basketball\" by Max McElwain, and in the 2008 Iowa Public Television special \"More Than a Game: Six-on-Six Basketball in Iowa\". \"Six-On-Six: The Musical\", a show by Robert John Ford celebrating the sport's popularity in Iowa, debuted in 2009 at Hoyt Sherman Place in Des Moines.\nThe format is currently in use by the Granny Basketball League. Formed in Iowa in 2005, the league consists of women aged 50 and older who play by 1920s rules and wear 1920s-style uniforms.\nSix-on-six women's basketball was dramatized in the 2021 film, \"New Providence\" directed by Thor Moreno.\nIn January 2023, six-on-six basketball was the focus of an episode of the podcast 99% Invisible."

        "title": "1997 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 1997 Rose Bowl was a postseason college football bowl game between the Arizona State Sun Devils of the Pacific-10 Conference and the Ohio State Buckeyes of the Big Ten Conference. The game was the 83rd edition of the annual Rose Bowl Game, held on New Year's Day in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. The game resulted in a dramatic 20–17 victory for the Buckeyes when Joe Germaine led a last-minute touchdown drive. Joe Germaine was named the Rose Bowl Player Of The Game. The loss remains infamous among Arizona State fans, as the loss cost them a chance at winning their only national championship. Had they won, they would've been the only undefeated team in the nation, and as a result, would've likely given the Devils at least a share of the national championship.\nTeams.\nOhio State.\nThe Buckeyes had rolled through the regular season using a two-quarterback system; Stanley Jackson and Joe Germaine split time in each game at QB. The Buckeye offensive attack was led by Outland Trophy- and Lombardi Award-winning tackle Orlando Pace (who would go on to be the #1 pick in the ensuing NFL Draft) and true freshman wide receiver David Boston, a budding star. The Buckeyes’ only loss was in the regular-season finale against archrival Michigan, which spoiled their undefeated season and national title hopes; however, OSU had clinched a berth in the Rose Bowl one week before The Game with a win over Indiana. The defense was led by the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year, lockdown cornerback Shawn Springs, and true freshman middle linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer.\nArizona State.\nThe Sun Devils, meanwhile, were undefeated, ranked #2 in the nation, and had hopes of capturing the school's first national championship in football. Leading the way for ASU were senior quarterback Jake Plummer, tailback Terry Battle, and a stingy defense led by end Derrick Rodgers and linebacker Pat Tillman. Perhaps ASU's most impressive regular-season victory came against defending national champion Nebraska, when ASU's defense held the ’Huskers scoreless; Arizona State won by a score of 19–0.\nGame summary.\nFirst quarter.\nThe Buckeyes scored first midway through the opening period when quarterback Stanley Jackson threw a nine-yard touchdown pass to true freshman wideout David Boston, capping a drive that saw Jackson scramble for some twenty yards on a third down. Josh Jackson’s PAT was good, making it 7–0 in favor of the Buckeyes. No other scoring ensued in the period, and the Buckeyes led after one, 7–0.\nSecond quarter.\nShortly before halftime, the Sun Devils finally answered via a 25-yard pass play from Jake Plummer to Ricky Boyer, tying the game after Robert Nycz’s extra point. Replays seemed to show that Boyer had trapped the ball against the end zone turf, but the touchdown stood. Neither team could manage any more points before halftime, and the game went to the break, still tied at 7–7.\nThird quarter.\nAfter halftime, the Sun Devils would add a 37-yard field goal by Nycz to take a 10-7 lead on the opening drive of the second half.\nThe Buckeyes countered only two plays later, when Joe Germaine hit Dimitrious Stanley on a post pattern. ASU corner Jason Simmons slipped and fell on the turf, and Stanley was off to the races. 72 yards and an extra point later, the Buckeyes were back on top with a 14–10 lead. \nNo more scoring ensued in the third, and the teams went to the fourth quarter with the game very much up for grabs.\nFourth quarter.\nLate in the fourth quarter, the Buckeyes looked to put the game away. Pepe Pearson broke a long run, leading the Buckeyes from inside their own five-yard line deep into ASU territory. However, the drive stalled only three plays later, and OSU had to settle for a Josh Jackson field goal attempt.\nThat was not to be, as ASU's Brent Burnstein blocked the kick. ASU Defensive end Derrick Rodgers took what appeared to be a lateral and ran the ball into the end zone, but the play was called back: Rodgers had taken an illegal \"forward\" lateral. The Sun Devils, however, had the ball with less than five minutes to play.\nJake Plummer, who had built a reputation over his college career for leading late comeback drives, did just that. The key play was a fourth down conversion when Plummer hit wideout Lenzie Jackson for a big gain. With just over a minute remaining, Plummer scrambled for eleven yards and a touchdown on third-and-goal, and ASU took the lead, 17–14.\nHowever, Germaine was not done. He led the Buckeyes on a remarkable last-minute drive. Dimitrious Stanley caught two third-down passes from Germaine, and then, with the help of two pass interference penalties against ASU, the Bucks had the ball on the Devils’ five-yard line. Germaine then flipped a pass to the aforementioned Boston, who was left undefended on a zig-out route — ASU redshirt freshman corner Courtney Jackson had blown the coverage. Boston walked into the end zone untouched, and the Buckeyes, with 19 seconds left, retook the lead, 20–17. On the next play, Burnstein blocked Josh Jackson's extra point, leaving the Sun Devils within a field goal.\nUltimately, Lenzie Jackson would be tackled in bounds by OSU's Antoine Winfield after catching a pass from Plummer on the second play of the ensuing drive, and time ran out. The Buckeyes had won the Rose Bowl — their first victory in the Rose Bowl since Archie Griffin’s sophomore season.\nAftermath.\nThe Buckeyes would finish #2 in the nation after winning their first Rose Bowl since January 1, 1974, handing the Sun Devils their only loss of the season. The previously-third-ranked Florida Gators would end up winning the national championship after defeating the then-top-ranked Florida State Seminoles 52–20 in the Sugar Bowl. FSU had defeated the Gators earlier in the season by a score of 24–21. Had the Sun Devils won the game, they would likely had a claim to at least the AP national championship, since they would have been the only undefeated team in the nation. They ultimately finished fourth in both polls, behind Florida, Ohio State and Florida State.\nBuckeye quarterback Joe Germaine, who was named the game's Most Valuable Player, would go on to be named the Big Ten's Most Valuable Player during his senior season of 1998. Many of the players on both teams’ rosters would go on to pro careers: notably, Jake Plummer, Pat Tillman, Derek Smith, Jason Simmons, Scott Von Der Ahe, Steve Bush, and Derrick Rodgers of Arizona State, and Mike Vrabel, Shawn Springs, Orlando Pace, Antoine Winfield, Rob Kelly and Damon Moore of Ohio State."

        "title": "Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball",
        "text": "The Wisconsin Badgers are an NCAA Division I college basketball team competing in the Big Ten Conference. The Badgers' home games are played at the Kohl Center, located on the University of Wisconsin–Madison campus in Madison, Wisconsin. Wisconsin has 1,683 wins through the end of the 2022–23 season which is top 50 all-time among Division I college basketball programs. Wisconsin has appeared in the NCAA tournament 27 times.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1898–1911).\nWisconsin Badger basketball began in December, 1898 with the formation of its first team coached by Dr. James C. Elsom. The Badgers played their first game on January 21, 1899, losing to the Milwaukee Normal Alumni 25–15 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin . In 1905, Christian Steinmetz became the first Wisconsin Badger basketball player to be named All-American. In the 1906–07 season, Wisconsin won its first share of the Big Ten Championship, under the coaching of Emmett Angell. They won it again the next year in 1908.\nWalter Meanwell era (1911–1934).\nWalter Meanwell began coaching the Badgers in 1911. In his first season, he led Wisconsin to an undefeated season (15–0), and then led them to another 15–0 season in 1913–14. Meanwell's teams would win eight Big Ten Championships during his tenure, in 1912, 1913, 1914, 1916, 1921, 1923, 1924, and 1929. Between the 1917–18 and 1919–20 seasons, Guy Lowman coached the Badgers, leading them to a 1918 Big Ten Conference Championship before Meanwell returned in 1920. Meanwell would also coach two All-Americans during his Wisconsin career, George Levis in 1916 and Harold \"Bud\" Foster in 1930. On December 18, 1930, the first game was played in the new Wisconsin Field House, a basketball arena with a capacity of 11,500.\nBud Foster era (1934–1959).\nStarting with the 1934–35 season, former UW basketball player Bud Foster began coaching the Wisconsin Badgers. In his first season as head coach, he led the Badgers to their 12th Big Ten Conference Championship in 28 years. In 1941, Foster led the Badgers to their only NCAA Championship in history. With the help of tournament MOP John Kotz and All-American Gene Englund, the Badgers beat Washington State 39–34 in the final game of the NCAA Tournament. It was their first ever invitation to the NCAA Tournament, after winning the Big Ten Championship in that year. Foster coached three All-Americans during his tenure – Gene Englund in 1941, John Kotz in 1942 and Don Rehfeldt in 1950. The Badgers won one more Big Ten championship in 1947 and attended their second NCAA Tournament. It would be their last postseason appearance of any sort for 42 years, and their last NCAA appearance for 47 years.\n1959–1994.\nThe mediocre records of the last decade of Foster's tenure would remain largely the norm for the Badgers for the next four decades. From 1954 to 1995, the Badgers would have only eight winning seasons. They also notched only two winning records in Big Ten play and finished as high as fourth only four times. Among the few bright spots during this time were the 1962 win over number one ranked Ohio State and stars Jerry Lucas and John Havlicek, NIT appearances under Steve Yoder in 1989 and 1991, and another in 1992 under Stu Jackson. The revival of Wisconsin basketball began in the early 1990s, when Yoder and Jackson recruited and developed Michael Finley, Tracy Webster, Rashard Griffith and other talented players. In 1994, the Badgers returned to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1947 and notched their first win in that tournament since winning it all in 1941.\nDick Bennett era (1995–2000).\nIn 1995, Dick Bennett then took over after leading Wisconsin-Green Bay to mid-major prominence. In 1997, he led the Badgers to their first winning Big Ten record in 23 years, and only their second in 43 years. The Badgers began a run of consecutive NCAA tournament appearances in 1999, and reached the NCAA tournament Final Four in 2000.\nIn 2000, the Badgers entered the NCAA tournament seeded #8 in the West bracket. Beyond most expectations, they defeated #9 Fresno St, #1 Arizona, #4 LSU, and #6 Purdue in order to advance to the Final Four. However, the Badgers then lost to #1 and eventual national champion Michigan State, 53–41.\nAfter three games into the 2000–01 season (in which he went 2–1), Bennett abruptly retired due to burnout. His final game was a 78–75 win over eventual Final Four participant Maryland. Assistant Brad Soderberg was named interim head coach. Soderberg led Wisconsin to a 16–10 record (18–11 overall), but was upset in the first round of the NCAA tournament by Georgia State.\nBo Ryan era (2001–2015).\nSoderberg was let go at the end of the 2000–01 season, and Wisconsin hired University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee coach Bo Ryan as the new head coach. Ryan had previously won four Division III national championships at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville.\nCoach Bo Ryan brought the program continued success, achieving greater regular season and NCAA tournament success in his 15-year tenure than the program had achieved over the prior 60 years. Since the late 1990s Wisconsin has turned into a basketball powerhouse making regular trips to the NCAA Tournament. Since 2001-2002 Wisconsin has finished in the top 4 in the Big Ten regular season standings 19 times in the past 21 seasons, and have won 6 Big Ten regular season championships and 3 Big Ten tournament championships.\nIn the 2001–02 season, under the new leadership of Bo Ryan, the Badgers went 19–13 (11–5) and won a share of the Big Ten regular season title for the first time since 1947, tying for first place in the Big Ten with Indiana, Illinois, and Ohio State. The Badgers defeated St. John's 90–80 in Ryan's first NCAA tournament game before falling to eventual national champion Maryland.\nDuring the 2002–03 season, Wisconsin secured its first outright regular season conference title in 56 years. The Badgers lost in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament to Ohio State. They then attended the NCAA tournament with a #5 seed, beating Weber State in the first round and Tulsa in the second round. The Badgers then lost to Kentucky in the Sweet Sixteen.\nIn the 2003–04 season, Wisconsin finished second in the Big Ten behind Illinois. They went on to win the Big Ten tournament for the first time since its inception in 1998. The Badgers defeated Minnesota in a quarterfinal, rallied to beat Michigan State in a semifinal, and defeated Illinois in the final. However, because the game was played too late to be taken under consideration by the NCAA tournament selection committee, the Badgers received a #6 seed. They defeated Richmond in the first round before losing to #3 seed Pittsburgh in the second round.\nIn the 2004–05 season, Wisconsin finished third in the Big Ten. In the Big Ten tournament semifinal against Iowa, Alando Tucker made a long shot at the buzzer to give UW a 3-point win, but the Badgers lost to #1 ranked Illinois in the championship. In the 2005 NCAA tournament, Wisconsin advanced to the Elite Eight by defeating #11 seed Northern Iowa, #14 seed Bucknell, and #10 seed North Carolina State before losing to #1 and eventual national champion, North Carolina.\nIn the 2005–06 season, the Badgers had a somewhat disappointing season that culminated in a loss to Indiana in the Big Ten tournament quarterfinals, and another loss to Arizona in the first round of the NCAA tournament. The highlight of the season was a win over intrastate rival Marquette.\nThe Badgers' lone non-conference loss was against Missouri State. On February 19, 2007, the Badgers earned their first #1 ranking in school history with a 26–2 record, but the next day, were defeated by the unranked Michigan State Spartans 64–55 at the Breslin Center. Entering the Big Ten tournament as the #2 seed, they defeated Michigan State 70–57. The Badgers defeated the Fighting Illini in the semi-finals, 53–41, to advance to the finals against Ohio State, where they were beaten 66–49.\nThe Badgers were selected as a 2nd seed in the NCAA tournament, but were defeated by 7th-seeded UNLV in the second round.\nIn the 2007–08 season, the Badgers finished first in the Big Ten, winning the Big Ten regular season outright and the conference tournament, defeating the Illinois Fighting Illini in the finals. In the NCAA tournament, the Badgers were awarded a No. 3 seed and won their first game against California State University, Fullerton. They followed that up with a win in the second round over Michael Beasley and the Kansas State Wildcats, due in part to 25 points from sophomore Trevon Hughes. The Badgers then lost to the No. 10 seed Davidson Wildcats and Stephen Curry by a score of 73–56 in the Sweet Sixteen.\nIn the 2008–09 season, the Badgers finished tied for 4th in the Big Ten with an overall record of 19–11 and 10–8 in the Big Ten. In the NCAA tournament, the Badgers were awarded a No. 12 seed and upset No. 5 seed Florida State University in the first round, 61–59. In the second round the Badgers lost 60–49 to the No. 4 seed Xavier University. The Badgers finished the 2008–09 season with an overall record of 20–13.\nIn the 2009–10 season, Wisconsin defeated three top 5-ranked teams during the regular season: Duke, Purdue, and Michigan State. The Badgers finished the season tied for 4th in the Big Ten, with a record of 23–7 overall and 13–5 in the Big Ten. In the NCAA tournament, the Badgers were awarded a #4 seed. They beat #13 seed Wofford in the first round, 53–49. In the second round the Badgers lost 87–69 to the #12 seed Cornell University. The Badgers finished the 2009–10 season with an overall record of 24–9.\nRyan led the Badgers to the school's third undefeated season at home in 2010–11. The Badgers finished 25–9 overall (13–5 Big Ten). In February 2011, they beat then-undefeated Ohio State University, the school's second win over the AP No. 1 team. After falling to Penn State in the first round of the Big Ten tournament, the Badgers secured a No. 4-seed in the NCAA Tournament. The team beat 13th-seed Belmont and fifth-seed Kansas State. They fell to Butler in the Sweet Sixteen. Jordan Taylor was named a second-team All-American, and Jon Leuer was honorable mention. Leuer was selected in the second round of the NBA draft by the Milwaukee Bucks.\nThe Badgers finished the 2011–12 season 26–10 overall (12–6 Big Ten). In the Big Ten tournament, Wisconsin was the #4 seed and defeated the #5 seed Hoosiers before losing to the #1 seed Spartans. In the NCAA Tournament, the Badgers were awarded the 4th-seed in the East Region. The team defeated 13th-seeded Montana and 5th-seeded Vanderbilt. In the regional semifinal, Wisconsin faced the #1 seeded Syracuse, losing 64–63.\nThe 2012–13 Badgers lost junior starting point guard Josh Gasser, who tore his ACL in October. Wisconsin defeated Michigan and Indiana in the Big Ten tournament before losing to Ohio State in the championship.

He played between 1994 and 2000 in the National Hockey League (NHL).\nPlaying career.\nMurray was drafted 54th overall by the Montreal Canadiens in 1994 from the Western Hockey League's Kamloops Blazers and started his National Hockey League career with the Canadiens in the 1994–95 NHL season. He remained with the team for the best of three years before he was part of a three-way trade between Montreal, the Phoenix Coyotes and the Hartford Whalers on March 18, 1997.

        "title": "Mick Cronin (basketball)",
        "text": "Michael Walter Cronin (born July 17, 1971) is an American men's college basketball coach who is the head coach of the UCLA Bruins of the Pac-12 Conference.\nCronin was named the Pac-12 Coach of the Year in his first season with the Bruins in 2019–20. The following year, his team went to the Final Four. Cronin arrived at UCLA having previously served as the head coach for the Cincinnati Bearcats for 13 seasons. Cronin had been named the coach of the year of the American Athletic Conference (AAC) in 2014 and guided Bearcats' program to nine straight NCAA tournament appearances (through 2018–19). Prior to joining Cincinnati in 2006, he coached the Murray State Racers from 2003 to 2006.\nEarly life.\nCronin grew up on the west side of Cincinnati, the son of Peggy and Harold \"Hep\" Cronin. Hep Cronin was a high school coach with more than 400 career wins in Cincinnati. Mick was one of three children along with older brother, Dan, and sister, Kelly. Not only did his father coach basketball, he also was a teacher, a baseball scout for the Atlanta Braves, and an employee at River Downs race track during the summers.\nAttending La Salle High School, the Cronin, playing point guard for his dad, earned all-city honors in basketball at LaSalle. He led the city in assists and was second in 3-point shooting percentage during the 1989–90 season. A knee injury to his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) near the end of his junior season ended his playing career.\nAs a student at the University of Cincinnati, while accompanying his dad to scout a Cincinnati Woodward High School game, Cronin was offered a job coaching the freshman team and assisting with the varsity by then-Bulldogs coach Jim Leon. From 1991 to 1996, he served as a varsity assistant coach and junior varsity coach at Woodward High. Cronin compiled a 57–3 record in three seasons as JV coach, and as a varsity aide, Woodward claimed three city championships. While at Woodward, Cronin helped develop six players who went on to play Division I college basketball, including former University of Louisville players Eric Johnson and Dion Edwards, and former Cincinnati guard Damon Flint.\nCronin received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from the University of Cincinnati in 1996.\nIn the spring of 1996, Cronin coached the East team in the Magic Johnson Roundball Classic. He was director of the 1994 Pittsburgh high school Roundball Classic national all-star game. Cronin has coached and served on the selection committee for the Adidas camp and spent four summers on the staff of the Five-Star Teaching Camp.\nCollege coaching career.\nEarly jobs.\nCronin took his first college coaching job as a video coordinator under Bob Huggins at the University of Cincinnati in 1996–97, and the following season was elevated to assistant coach, a post he held at UC until 2001. Cronin built a reputation for his ability to evaluate and recruit top talent; at UC as an assistant for Huggins from 1997 to 2001, Cronin recruits included NBA draft selections Steve Logan (Golden State Warriors), DerMarr Johnson (Atlanta Hawks), Pete Mickeal and Kenny Satterfield (both drafted by the Dallas Mavericks), and Jason Maxiell (Detroit Pistons).\nCronin became the associate head coach and recruiting coordinator at Louisville under Rick Pitino, beginning with the 2001–02 season. In his first year, Cronin helped attract a top-10 ranked recruiting class.\nMurray State.\nCronin's first head coaching job was at Murray State, where he was hired in 2003. In three seasons at Murray, Cronin led the team to the NCAA tournament twice and was named the 2006 Ohio Valley Conference coach of the year.\nCincinnati.\nAfter the 2005–06 season, he was hired as Cincinnati's coach, replacing interim coach Andy Kennedy after the dismissal of Bob Huggins. Cronin had to pick up the pieces from a depleted program after Huggins was asked to resign with no warning three months before the 2005 season, and a temporary coach was used for a season. Due to the school having done little to no recruiting for nearly a year, Cronin was forced to scrounge for players. He even had a couple players on the football team play, one being future NFL linebacker Connor Barwin.\nAlthough Cronin's teams struggled early in his UC career, he improved the school's win total each of his first five seasons. From the beginning of the 2010 season to February 3, 2017, the Bearcats had amassed a 166–63 record, spent 45 weeks ranked in the AP Poll, and reached six straight NCAA tournaments, while picking up four tournament wins.\nFor the 2009–10 season, Cronin was able to successfully recruit Lance Stephenson, the all-time leading scorer in New York state high school basketball history who later had NBA stints with multiple teams. During his one season at Cincinnati, Stephenson was named the Big East Rookie of the Year.\nCronin is also the only UC coach to ever lead the Bearcats to a win over a higher seed in the NCAA tournament, when 6th-seeded Cincinnati defeated 3rd-seeded Florida State in 2012. It was the only season that the Bearcats advanced to the Sweet Sixteen under Cronin. In 2018–19, Cincinnati appeared in its ninth straight NCAA tournament, but was eliminated in the first round by Iowa.\nIn 2011, the University of Cincinnati board of trustees approved a contract extension for Cronin through 2017 with an average pay of $1.5 million a year. It included an increase in salary for his staff, as well as an increase in the basketball program budget. In 2016, the UC board of trustees approved a 2-year extension that would have taken Cronin through the 2022–23 season.\nCronin had long been pushing for either a new arena or a renovation of Fifth Third Arena in order for the Bearcats to remain competitive on a national scale. In March 2017, the University of Cincinnati began an $87 million renovation which was completed in the fall of 2018. Cronin said, \"This building is about our future and is a testament to the commitment our university and donors have toward our programs.\"\nUCLA.\nOn April 9, 2019, Cronin was named the fourteenth head coach of the UCLA Bruins, replacing the fired Steve Alford. At the time, the 47-year old Cronin had the most NCAA Division I wins (365) of any active coach younger than 50. He was also one of only six coaches to have led their school to the NCAA tournament in each of the past nine seasons. Cronin had coached against the Bruins three times. After Cincinnati lost to UCLA in the 2017 NCAA tournament, they defeated the Bruins in two consecutive regular-season matches by an average of 21.5 points. Its 29-point win in 2018–19 was part of a UCLA four-game losing streak which led up to Alford's midseason dismissal. In his first year in 2019–20, the Bruins starting slowly at 8–9 before going 11–3 and finishing second in the Pac-12 at 12–6. Cronin was named the Pac-12 Coach of the Year. The Bruins earned a No. 2 seed and a first-round bye in the Pac-12 tournament. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the conference tournament was cancelled before the Bruins' first scheduled game in the quarterfinals, and the NCAA tournament was called off as well.\nIn 2020–21, UCLA finished their regular season with a 17–8 record, 13–6 in the Pac-12. They lost their last three regular-season games in a row and lost their game against Oregon State in the Pac-12 tournament. They were selected to open in the First Four of the NCAA tournament. They defeated Michigan State in the First Four for the Bruins' first NCAA tournament win since 2017 and then went on to defeat BYU in a first-round game on their way to reaching the Sweet Sixteen. Cronin then led the Bruins to an overtime victory over No. 2 seeded Alabama, reaching the Elite Eight for the first time in his coaching career (and the first for UCLA since 2008). They defeated No. 1 seed Michigan to become the second First Four team to advance to the Final Four, the Bruins' first national semifinal since 2008. They faced Gonzaga, who was seeking to become the first undefeated national champion since Indiana in 1976. UCLA was a 14-point underdog, the largest Final Four point spread since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985. The Bruins lost 93–90 in overtime after the Bulldogs' Jalen Suggs banked in a shot as time expired in the game, a match that featured 19 lead changes and 15 ties.\nOn March 17, 2022, Cronin's contract was extended for 6 years to the 2027–28 season. He led the 2021–22 team to the Sweet Sixteen of the 2022 NCAA tournament, the first time the Bruins had reached the regional semifinals in consecutive seasons since 2015. In 2022–23, they won their first Pac-12 regular season championship since 2012–13. He was again voted the Pac-12 Coach of the Year. A two-seed in the 2023 NCAA tournament, UCLA advanced to their third straight Sweet Sixteen. They were eliminated by Gonzaga for the second time in three years. The Bulldogs' Julian Strawther made a basket with six seconds remaining, and they held on for the win. In 2023–24, UCLA's roster had seven freshmen and eight newcomers overall, along with three sophomores. They were eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Pac-12 tournament, ending Cronin's streak of 12 consecutive NCAA tournament appearances.\nPersonal life and community involvement.\nBefore accepting the UCLA job, Cronin was very active in the Cincinnati area. Cronin annually spoke with the Young Executive Group of the Catholic Inner-City Schools Education (CISE) Fund. The group raises money from area corporations to help give children from low-income urban settings the opportunity to attend Catholic schools.\nCronin resided in Anderson Township in the Cincinnati area with his daughter Samantha. He was married to Darlene Taylor until they divorced in 2009. Cronin's father, Hep, who lives with Mick's sister, Kelly, attends Bearcats games, frequently attends their practices and sometimes travels with the team. Cronin's mother, Peggy, died of cancer in 2005. His brother, Dan, starred at Bethel College in basketball and baseball, and was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in 1988. Dan is also a cancer survivor.\nOn December 22, 2014, during the 2014–2015 season, Cronin, 43, was diagnosed with an unruptured aneurysm detected when he underwent medical testing for unexplained headaches. On January 2, 2015, it was announced that, although doctors expected the condition to heal with rest and medication, Cronin would not coach the remainder of the season. However, Cronin said he felt great and that he would be able to continue to oversee the program and be involved in recruiting. On March 30, 2015, Cronin announced he had a clean bill of health and was cleared to return to full-time coaching duties following his diagnosis of an arterial dissection.\nHead coaching record.\n ^abc Cronin missed a portion of the 2014–15 season due to an illness, having only coached for the first nine games. Cronin was credited with both the wins and the losses for that season, based on a decision by athletic director Mike Bohn after school officials sought a ruling on the issue from the NCAA and were told that it was up to the school."

        "title": "Premier Basketball League",
        "text": "The Premier Basketball League, often abbreviated to the PBL, is an American professional men's basketball minor league that began play in January 2008. The league folded after the 2017 season. It was announced that the league would be revived under new management for the 2020 season. The league announced due coronavirus outbreak the season would be put on hold. \nHistory.\n2008 season.\nThe PBL was formed after a number of disagreements between several former member teams of the modern American Basketball Association (ABA) and ABA CEO Joe Newman. Eight of the initial ten PBL teams either played in or were slated to play in the ABA.\nIn early 2007, Newman was voted out of his position as CEO of the ABA by the board of directors, which included Maryland Nighthawks owner and then-ABA COO Tom Doyle (who was later a commissioner of the PBL), citing dissatisfaction with how Newman executed his duties as CEO, the large number of ABA teams that did not have the funds to operate, and high number of games when an ABA team did not show up. Newman responded by using his and other shares that formed a controlling interest to remove the entire board of directors.\nNewman then refused to reschedule a weather-delayed playoff game between the Rochester RazorSharks and Wilmington Sea Dawgs although the two teams agreed to a make up date, wanting instead to force Rochester to accept a forfeit. It was on the heels of these two incidents that the Nighthawks and RazorSharks ownership groups decided to found the PBL. Dr. Sev Hrywnak, owner of the Rochester RazorSharks, invested close to $2 million to start the PBL. The business model was structured so that teams entering the initial season did not have to pay an entrance fee of $100,000 and that all travel would be covered by the League. This would allow new teams the opportunity to have financial success from the start.\nFormer Houston Rockets point guard and current NBA on TNT analyst Kenny Smith was the league's first commissioner.\n2009 season.\nDuring the 2008 off season, six more former ABA teams decided to move to the PBL. First, on May 9, the Manchester Millrats and the 2006–2007 and 2007–2008 ABA champion Vermont Frost Heaves moved. Then on May 20, the inactive Detroit Panthers re-activated and joined the league. And on May 21, the Quebec Kebs joined. On June 5 another team with an ABA history, the Augusta Groove, joined the league, but from the Continental Basketball Association. On June 23, the Halifax Rainmen, an ABA team the previous year, announced they were also joining the PBL. The first International Basketball League defection came on July 31 when the Battle Creek Knights joined the league.

He played college football for the Georgia Bulldogs. He was selected in the fifth round of the 1974 NFL Draft.\nEducation.\nHe was a 1970 graduate of Athens High School, now Clarke Central High School, in Athens, Georgia, where he played quarterback. He then attended the University of Georgia.\nSports career.\nJohnson earned Georgia football and baseball letters in 1971, 1972, &amp; 1973. He played quarterback as a sophomore, leading the Bulldogs to an 11–1 record, passing for 341 yards and rushing for 870 yards. In 1973, he passed for 506 yards for the season. He had 431 rush attempts for 1799 yards during his Georgia career becoming one of the top five SEC rushing quarterbacks for a career. He played shortstop for the Georgia baseball team.\nHe was drafted by the New England Patriots in 1974 in the 5th round of the NFL Draft, pick 112 overall. He played running back with the Patriots from 1974 to 1981. Johnson's best season was in 1976 when he scored 10 total touchdowns and had 1,042 combined yards of rushing and receiving while the Patriots finished 2nd in the AFC East which was good enough for a playoff spot. In his game against the Raiders in the Divisional round, he rushed for 32 yards on 14 carries with one touchdown, though they lost the game 24-21 amid dubious penalty calling. His productivity declined after the 1978 season, a season in which he was one of four players on the team who rushed for over 500 yards (Sam Cunningham, Horace Ivory and quarterback Steve Grogan). Over the next four seasons, he rushed for only 159 yards combined. He played one season with the Boston Breakers of the USFL before retiring. He was named to the New England Patriots All-1970s Team in 2009.\nHe was a 1996 inductee into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame and 2000 inductee into the Athens Athletic Hall of Fame. He was vice-president of the Georgia Lettermen's Club.\nDeath.\nJohnson died on May 16, 2018, age 65, from a lengthy undisclosed illness. He is survived by his wife Charlotte and their three children."

        "text": "Tom O'Rourke (May 13, 1856 – June 19, 1936) was born in Boston and became a boxing manager in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\nO'Rourke boxed in his youth, but his primary talent was rowing. He began managing boxers in the late 1880s, finally getting the black bantamweight George Dixon in his stable in 1889. O'Rourke saw Dixon outmatch Paddy Kelly in Boston, and began managing him to an eventual meeting with Cal McCarthy, the lightweight champion of the world. The bout ended in a draw, so O'Rourke and Dixon took their show on the road, eventually claiming the world championship in 1891, and the featherweight championship in 1892 in New Orleans in a rare (for the time) mixed-race bout, a tribute to O'Rourke's matchmaking abilities.\nIn addition to Dixon, O'Rourke managed Joe Walcott (note: not Jersey Joe Walcott, who took his name from O'Rourke's boxer), who won the welterweight championship of the world in 1901. Walcott and Dixon are famous for traveling with O'Rourke in a \"take on all comers\" tour, where O'Rourke had his own, slightly smaller than usual, boxing ring for the bouts. The smaller ring gave his boxers an advantage, as both men were known for their straightforward style.\nIn 1902, O'Rourke arranged the World Series of Football while serving as manager of Madison Square Garden trying to bring in attractions while promoting various boxing events. Pop Warner played his last game for the event. He held another World Series of Football in 1903 but lackluster support led him to end the event.\nAnother well-known boxer of O'Rourke's is Sailor Tom Sharkey, who was managed by O'Rourke when he lost the heavyweight title bout with James J. Jeffries in 1899.\nThe number one fighter that he began managing was George Gardner, once the Light Heavyweight Champion of the World in 1903. Gardner won the title from Jack Root and lost the title to Bob Fitzsimmons. It is often thought that the Fitzsimmons match was a publicity stunt, possibly a bribery making Fitzsimmons the first triple title champion in boxing history.\nO'Rourke died after collapsing in Max Schmeling's dressing room prior to his bout with Joe Louis on June 19, 1936."

The flagship tournament for promoting the sport in Asia is the Asian Five Nations, which launched in 2008, and which most recently in 2011 saw the national teams of Hong Kong (national team), Japan (national team), Kazakhstan (national team), Sri Lanka (national team) and the UAE, compete in the main tournament.\nThe sport in Asia is currently dominated by Japan, the only Asian nation to be represented on World Rugby's executive council. The Japanese national team are so far the only Asian team to have competed in the Rugby World Cup, having appeared in all seven tournaments so far. Japan served as the hosts for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, which saw them become the first Asian country to host the tournament.\nThe Top League is Japan's premier rugby club competition, founded in 2003. In 2016, the Sunwolves joined the Southern Hemisphere-based Super Rugby. The team is based in Tokyo but also plays home games in Singapore.\nMember nations.\nSixteen Asian teams are full members of World Rugby, though one (Guam) is arguably in Oceania.\nThere are also six Asian associate members of World Rugby:\nLike Georgia and Russia, and as in football, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Israel play in Europe, though Kazakhstan does not.\nThe Arabian Gulf Rugby Football Union existed from 1974 to 2010 and its Arabian Gulf team represented five countries: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The body no longer exists.\nWorld Cup qualifying.\n1991 World Cup.\nThe 1991 World Cup was the first to operate a qualification system, the 1987 WC having been invitation-only. In the qualifying stage, Asia was combined with Oceania and given two berths. Only four countries took part; Japan, South Korea, Tonga and Western Samoa (Australia, Fiji and New Zealand were automatic qualifiers). Played as a four-team round-robin, Western Samoa and Japan finished first and second respectively courtesy of Japan's 28–16 win over Tonga, with the Japanese becoming the first Asian team to appear at the World Cup.\nAlthough they lost their first two games and did not qualify for the quarter-finals, Japan secured third spot in their group with a 52–8 win over Zimbabwe.\n1995 World Cup.\nFor the 1995 WC, Asia held its own tournament, with the winner qualifying for the finals. This time eight countries entered (Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan and Thailand), and were split into two groups, with the winners of each group playing each other for the single qualification berth. The final play-off saw Japan beat South Korea 26–11.\nThe group stages showed the inequalities in the Asian game; Japan won 103–9 against Malaysia, whilst Hong Kong thrashed Singapore 164–13. The World Cup itself did little to showcase Asian rugby, as Japan lost every game, including a humiliating 145–17 defeat against the All Blacks.\n1999 World Cup.\nFor the 1999 WC, Asia was given an extra qualification spot, albeit a repechage one. The same eight countries entered the qualification stages, but to avoid the scorelines witnessed in the previous competition, it was held on a three-stage basis; Singapore, Sri Lanka and Thailand competing in the first round-robin (with Sri Lanka going through); Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Taiwan in the second round (with Taiwan progressing); and then Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan in the third round. Japan again emerged victorious, with a 134–6 win over Taiwan going some way to regain the pride lost in the finals in South Africa four years earlier. South Korea took part in the repechage, beating Holland 108–45 on aggregate in the first round, before losing 140–41 over two legs to Tonga. Japan once again lost all their games in the World Cup proper.\n2003 World Cup.\nAsia retained its single berth plus repechage spot (vs. Oceania) in the 2003 WC qualifiers. This time, eleven teams took part, with the Arabian Gulf, China and Kazakhstan joining the fray.\nBefore Japan and South Korea entered the competition, the other nine teams were split into three round-robin pools, with the winners (China, Hong Kong and Taiwan) then playing another round-robin with the top team (Taiwan) going on to the final pool with Japan and South Korea, which would decide the automatic and repechage qualifying spots. Japan again emerged victorious, beating their previous score against Taiwan in a 155–3 win at home (their largest ever win), followed by a 120–3 scoreline in the away match. South Korea again finished second, also thrashing Taiwan 119–7, and repeated their previous repechage performance, losing 194–0 over two legs to the Tongans.\n2007 World Cup.\nThirteen teams competed in the Asian qualifying tournament for the 2007 WC, Guam and India joining the competition for the first time.\nAnother new format was tried; this one more complex than previously; The first round, played in 2005, consisted of four \"divisions\"; 1, 2, 3a and 3b. In the second round, the top two of \"Division One (2005)\" and the winner of \"Division Two (2005)\" would form \"Division One (2006)\", whilst the bottom team of \"Division One (2005)\", the second (of three) in \"Division Two (2005)\", and the winner of a play-off between the \"Division 3a (2005)\" and \"Division 3b (2005)\" champions would form \"Division Two (2006)\". In the third round, the top two from \"Division One (2006)\" and the winner of \"Division Two (2006)\" would play a round-robin to decide the final placings.\nHong Kong, Japan and Korea formed \"Division One (2005)\", with Hong Kong finishing bottom and replaced by Arabian Gulf, who had won \"Division Two (2005)\". Taiwan finished bottom of Division Two, and were replaced by Sri Lanka, winners of the 3a-3b play-off over Kazakhstan. In the second round, Arabian Gulf finished bottom of \"Division One (2006)\", and were replaced in the final round by Hong Kong, who won \"Division Two (2006)\". In the final group, Japan again emerged victorious, sealing their place at the World Cup with a comprehensive 54–0 defeat of South Korea, who went on to lose to the Tongans for the third successive time, this time 85–3 in a one-off match in Wellington."

        "text": "South Adelaide Panthers is a NBL1 Central club based in Adelaide, South Australia. The club fields both a men's and women's team. The club is a division of the overarching South Adelaide Basketball Club (SABC), the major administrative basketball organisation in Adelaide's southern suburbs. The Panthers play their home games at Marion Basketball Stadium.\nClub history.\nThe South Adelaide Basketball Club (SABC) was formed in 1952. It was one of the foundation clubs in the sport of basketball in South Australia.\n1957 saw the formation of the South Australian State League with both a men's and women's competition. South Adelaide, trading as the Panthers, entered a team into both competitions. The women were grand finalists in their first two seasons, finishing as runners-up to North Adelaide in 1957 and as champions in 1958 after defeating Eagles.\nOn 26 September 1963, the men's team made history after defeating Budapest in their first ever grand final. The game heralded the start of an era for South Adelaide, with the Panthers men continuing on to claim 10 men's State championships (1963-65-66-69-73-87-89-91-95-97) over the ensuing decades.\nSouth Adelaide's three decades of dominance ended in 1998 with a 105–88 loss to Noarlunga City in the grand final. The women on the other hand saw dwindling prospects following 1958, with their only other grand final appearance coming in 2003, a game which saw them lose 74–51 to Forestville. In 2022, the men's team won the NBL1 Central Grand Final to claim their first championship since 1997.\nRetired numbers.\nIn March 2015, the Panthers retired the playing numbers of three of the club's greatest men's players: Michael Ah Matt (#8), Scott Ninnis (#9) and Mark Davis (#33). The three jerseys hang in the rafters at Marion Stadium.\nAh Matt in 1963 led the Panthers to the first of their 10 titles while twice winning the St George Trophy—now the Frank Angove Medal—as the fairest and most brilliant player in South Australia, under 21. Ninnis arguably is one of the most successful Australian basketball players of all time, having won titles at every senior level. He was a star for South Adelaide, winning the 1995 Woollacott Medal as the state's fairest and most brilliant player and winning championships with the club in 1987, 1995 and 1997. American forward Davis was brought to Adelaide by South in 1985 when the club was looking for an import and was told there was one \"killing it\" in New Zealand. Davis won five championships with the Panthers and a record five Woollacott Medals."

        "text": "Ted Owens (born July 16, 1929) is an American former college basketball coach, who was born in Hollis, Oklahoma. He is best-known as the coach of the University of Kansas men's basketball team from 1964 to 1983. He is the fourth-winningest coach in Jayhawks basketball history.\nPlayer and early coaching experience.\nOwens attended college at the University of Oklahoma (OU), where he was a three-year letterman under head coach Bruce Drake. He graduated with a BA degree in 1951. In 1956, he was hired to coach both baseball and basketball at Cameron Junior College (Lawton, Oklahoma), where he remained until 1960. His baseball team won the National JC Championship in 1958. The basketball team had a 93–24 record during his four years and appeared in three NJCAA Tournaments.\nOwens' overall Kansas record was 348–182 (.657), and his Big Eight Conference record was 170–96 (.639). In Owens' tenure at KU, he won six Big Eight Conference titles and advanced to the NCAA tournament seven times. His 1971 and 1974 teams made it to the Final Four, and in 1968 the Jayhawks lost to Dayton in the finals of the National Invitation Tournament. Owens was named Big Eight Conference Coach of the Year five times and was Named National Coach of the Year in 1978 by \"Basketball Weekly\". He coached five All-Americans: Jo Jo White, Darnell Valentine, Dave Robisch, Bud Stallworth and Walt Wesley. He was fired following the 1982–83 season after the Jayhawks posted back-to-back losing seasons. He is the only coach in the program's history to be fired. Kansas has not suffered a losing season since, and has only missed the NCAA tournament once since then, in 1988–89 when the program was on probation for recruiting violations committed by Owens' successor, Larry Brown.\nA three-year letterman at the University of Oklahoma (1949–51), Owens honed his coaching skills as head coach at Cameron State Junior College in Lawton, Oklahoma. In four seasons his teams never won fewer than 20 games and three times advanced to the NJCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship semifinals. At Cameron, he amassed a 93–24 record and boasted four junior college All-Americans.\nOwens then accepted an assistant's position under Dick Harp in 1960, and was promoted to head coach when Harp resigned following the 1963–64 season.\nOther coaching activities.\nOwens had a brief stint of coaching at Oral Roberts University (1985–87), and then in Israel with Maccabi Tel Aviv during the 1989–90 season, before being fired in February 1990. He then went on to be the development director and basketball coach at Metro Christian Academy (high school) in Tulsa, Oklahoma for five years where his teams won the district championship five times, and went to the state tournament three times. Subsequently, he moved on to be athletic director at St. Leo University in Florida for four years.\nOwens was inducted into the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame on August 3, 2009. He was inducted into the Kansas Hall of Fame in the same year.\nRetirement.\nAfter leaving St. Leo, a friend invited him to return to Tulsa and work as an investment adviser for First Capital Management, where he spent the next ten years. After retiring from this position, he decided to continue living in Tulsa in retirement. He returned to Lawrence to coach on September 24, 2011, for the \"Legends of the Phog\" exhibition match, opposite Larry Brown, in which various Kansas alumni played an exhibition game during the 2011 NBA lockout."

        "title": "World Fencing Championships",
        "text": "The World Fencing Championships is an annual competition in fencing organized by the Fédération Internationale d'Escrime (FIE; \"International Fencing Federation\" in English). Contestants may participate in foil, épée, and sabre events.\nHistory.\nThe FIE first organized an international fencing championship in Paris, France in 1921. The competition in its early years was named the European Championships (\"Championnats d'Europe\"), and the initial participants were members of the fencing federations of the FIE. In 1921, the only event was men's épée individual. In 1922 and 1923, men's sabre individual was also held. In 1925, only men's sabre individual was held. Since 1926, men's individual events have been held in all three weapons: épée, foil, and sabre. In 1929, women's foil was added to the program as well as a men's foil team event. Men's épée and sabre teams were added in 1930 and women's foil team in 1932. Women's épée individual and team events were added in 1988, and women's sabre individual and team in 1999.\nAfter the 1936 Olympics, the government of Benito Mussolini in Italy offered national recognition and privileges to winners of Olympic or world titles, but not European titles. The Italian fencing federation requested that the FIE change the name of the European Championships to World Championships (\"Championnats du Monde\"). The FIE approved this request and gave retroactive World Championship status to the previous European Championships.\nSince 1921, the FIE championships have occurred annually except for an interruption forced by World War II from 1939 to 1946, and in some of the years when the Summer Olympics are held. The fencing competitions at the Summer Olympics have served as the World Championships of the year for the relevant events. Since 1932, World Championships have been held during the Olympic years only for those events not being held during that year's Summer Olympics. For the years 1932, 1936, 1948, 1952, and 1956, World Championships were held only in Women's Foil Team since that event was not on the Olympic program during those years. After this event was added to the Olympic program beginning with the 1960 Olympics, the FIE stopped holding World Championships during the Olympic years until 1988 when women's épée individual and women's épée team events were added to the World Championship program, but the IOC declined to add these events to the Olympic program. A World Championship in these two events was again held in 1992 for the same reason. Finally, in 1996 the IOC added these two events to the Olympic program, and the FIE again stopped holding a World Championship in an Olympic year.\nWhen the FIE added women's sabre to the World Championships in 1999, the IOC refused to add these two events to the 2000 Olympic program and so the FIE held a World Championships in only women's sabre in 2000. For the 2004 Olympics, the IOC allowed women's sabre to be contested at the Olympics but only under the condition that the number of fencing events being contested (individual and team) remain at ten. The FIE reluctantly agreed to this condition, and has satisfied it by not contesting two of the team events at the Olympics but holding World Championships for them instead during those years. So World Championships have been held but Olympic events have not been held (2004–16) for the following events:\nFrom 2020 Summer Olympics, all 12 fencing events were held, which means no World Championships are held on Olympic years.\nNaming.\nThese World Fencing Championships are usually referred to as Senior World Fencing Championships because the FIE also runs three other World Championships. Beginning in 1950, the FIE also sanctioned an annual competitions which it originally called the Junior World Criterium (\"Criterium Mondial des Jeunes\"). Entries were originally restricted to those 21 years of age or lower, but in 1960 the age limit was dropped to 20. In 1964, the name of the competition was officially changed to Junior World Championships, and world championship status was retroactively granted to the participants of the previous competitions.\nBeginning in 1987, the FIE began sanctioning an annual competition called the Cadet World Championships. Entries were restricted to those 17 years of age or lower. Originally the Junior and Cadet World Championships were held in different cities on different dates, but beginning in 1993 they've been called the Junior/Cadet World Championships and have been held at the same venue with all of the cadet events held first followed by all of the junior events.\nBeginning in 1997, the FIE began sanctioning an annual competition called the Veteran World Championships. Entries were restricted to those 40 years of age or older the first year, and 50 years or older in subsequent years.\nMedal table.\nThis table has been last updated after the 2023 World Fencing Championships. This counts the medals from the World Championships since 1921, and does not include the results of the fencing competitions at the Summer Olympics.\nMultiple gold medalists.\nBoldface denotes active fencers and highest medal count among all fencers (including these who not included in these tables) per type. The numbers in brackets denotes number of medals earned at the unofficial World Championships in 1921–1936 (known as European Championships back then) which are counted in overall statistics."

        "text": "WrestleMania 25 (marketed as The 25th Anniversary of WrestleMania and WrestleMania 25th Anniversary) was the 25th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brand divisions. The event took place on April 5, 2009, at Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas. It was the second WrestleMania held in Houston; the first was WrestleMania X-Seven at the Reliant Astrodome, which was held in April 2001. It was also the last WrestleMania to feature the ECW brand.\nEight matches were held on the event's card, which featured a supercard, a scheduling of more than one main bout. The final match of the night, which was the main match of the Raw brand, was a singles match in which Triple H defeated Randy Orton to retain the WWE Championship. The main match of the SmackDown brand was a triple threat match for the World Heavyweight Championship, which saw John Cena defeat defending champion Edge and Big Show to win the championship. The main match of the ECW brand saw WWE Tag Team Champions The Colóns (Carlito and Primo) from SmackDown defeat the World Tag Team Champions John Morrison and The Miz from ECW in a lumberjack match to unify the two championships; the match took place on the event's pre-show. Another marquee match saw The Undertaker defeat Shawn Michaels to extend his undefeated WrestleMania streak to 17–0. Featured matches on the undercard included Matt Hardy defeating Jeff Hardy in an Extreme Rules match, Chris Jericho defeated the team of Roddy Piper, Ricky Steamboat and Jimmy Snuka, and the annual Money in the Bank ladder match which was won by CM Punk.\nTickets for the event commenced sale to the public on November 8, 2008. For the third consecutive year, WrestleMania broke the record for the highest-grossing pay-per-view in WWE history, grossing US$6.9 million in ticket sales, which included fans from all 50 U.S. states, 24 countries, and seven Canadian provinces. WrestleMania 25 generated approximately 960,000 pay-per-view buys, grossing $21.0 million in revenue. The event pumped an estimated $49.8 million into the local economy and generated $5.7 million in local tax revenue, equating to 600 full-time jobs for the area. With an attendance of 72,744, it is the 8th largest attendance in WrestleMania history.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nWrestleMania is considered World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) flagship pay-per-view (PPV) event, having first been held in 1985. It has become the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of WWE's original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". WrestleMania 25 was held on April 5, 2009, at Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas. The event featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands. The event was marketed as \"The 25th Anniversary of WrestleMania\" and written as \"WrestleMania 25th Anniversary\".\nAs the second WrestleMania to be held in Houston and the state of Texas after WrestleMania X-Seven at the Astrodome, WWE mainly promoted WrestleMania 25 under the tagline \"Everything Is Bigger in Texas, Especially WrestleMania\" since its announcement at WrestleMania XXIV in March 2008. WWE later began using \"The 25th Anniversary of WrestleMania\" name in late 2008 to primarily promote the event. Tickets for WrestleMania 25 were originally scheduled to go on sale September 20, 2008, but had to be postponed out of concern for the residents near the Gulf of Mexico due to Hurricane Ike and the disaster area declaration by Texas Governor Rick Perry. Following another postponement due to the effect of Ike on the state of Texas, WWE announced that ticket sales would be postponed until November 8, 2008.\nThe official theme songs for the event were AC/DC's \"War Machine\" and their live version of \"Shoot to Thrill\",&lt;ref name=\"AC/DC\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as \"So Hott\" by Kid Rock. Other songs used at the event include \"Crash\" by Decyfer Down and \"Touched\" by VAST.\nMarketing.\nAccording to WWE's executive vice president, Michelle Wilson, WrestleMania 25 featured the most extensive promotional campaign in WrestleMania history. Promotion for the event included a merchandise deal with Kmart enabling discounts on the pay-per-view's retail price, as well as deals with DirecTV and Dish Network to promote through interactive television. The campaign also saw WWE mail to previous purchasers of WrestleMania, professional boxing and mixed martial arts pay-per-views to order their show. WWE spent US$10 million for cross-channel spots on television networks such as ESPN, MTV and the USA Network. The Army National Guard were the primary sponsor for the event, using the event to help enhance their recruitment. To commemorate the event, THQ and Yuke's produced a video game, \"WWE Legends of WrestleMania\", that was released a few weeks prior to the event and featured past competitors from the company.\nAs with previous WrestleMania events, a series of events were held in the week preceding WrestleMania 25. For the second consecutive year, \"WrestleManiArt\", an art exhibition and auction featuring work by WWE wrestlers and local artists, was held at the Julia Ideson Building on April 1, with the proceeds going to Houston Public Library Foundation. WrestleMania's annual fan convention, WrestleMania Axxess, was held from April 2 through April 5 at Reliant Center. On April 4, WWE hosted its annual WWE Hall of Fame ceremony at the Toyota Center, where the Class of 2009 were inducted.\nStorylines.\nWrestleMania featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines that were played out on \"Raw\", \"Friday Night SmackDown\", and \"ECW on Sci Fi\"—World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) primary television programs. Wrestlers were portrayed as either a villain or a hero as they followed a series of events that built tension, and culminated into a wrestling match or series of matches. The event featured wrestlers from WWE's Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands—a storyline division in which WWE's employees are assigned to a television program of the same name.\nJohn \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) defeated CM Punk on the March 9 episode of \"Raw\" to win the WWE Intercontinental Championship. A week later, JBL's old rival Rey Mysterio issued a challenge to face JBL for the Intercontinental Championship at WrestleMania. With the match accepted by JBL, this would be the first time since WrestleMania X8 that the Intercontinental Championship would be defended at WrestleMania. On the March 30 episode of \"Raw\", JBL was pinned by Mysterio in a non-title match.\nAt No Way Out, Shawn Michaels defeated John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) in a match with the added stipulation that if JBL had won, he would have become the owner of Michaels' name and likeness. On the February 16 episode of \"Raw\", Michaels challenged JBL to another match, with the winner advancing to WrestleMania to challenge The Undertaker to attempt to end his undefeated streak at the event. The next week on \"Raw\", Michaels defeated JBL, but it was later announced that another competitor would stand in his way to prevent him from advancing to the show in the form of Vladimir Kozlov, who also made a challenge to Undertaker; the two wrestled the next week on \"Raw\" with Michaels defeating Kozlov, and earning his match with Undertaker. The next week on \"Raw\", Undertaker and Michaels defeated Kozlov and JBL in a tag match. After the match, Michaels attacked Undertaker. The pair played mind games with each other over the following weeks.\nThe headline of WrestleMania 25 was a confrontation over the WWE Championship, rooted at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view event in January by Randy Orton winning the Royal Rumble match. Per the traditional stipulation of the match, Orton was given the opportunity to choose to wrestle for the WWE, World Heavyweight, or ECW Championship at WrestleMania. Simultaneously, Orton began to assault the McMahon family, the owners of the WWE. During this conflict, Orton punted both Vince and Shane McMahon (father and son, respectively) in the head as well as RKO-ing Stephanie McMahon (Vince's daughter), which enraged the WWE Champion (and Stephanie's husband) Triple H. On the March 2 episode of \"Raw\", Triple H convinced Orton to use his title opportunity in a match for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania. The following weeks saw Triple H attack Orton both backstage and at his house. In retaliation, Orton attacked Triple H's wife Stephanie McMahon. As a result, Triple H recruited his brother-in-law and father-in-law, Shane and Vince McMahon respectively.\nAfter the main event of the March 2 episode of \"Raw\", SmackDown general manager Vickie Guerrero announced that her husband Edge would defend his World Heavyweight Championship against Big Show at WrestleMania. A contract to be signed to make the match official was intended to be held on the next episode of \"SmackDown\"; however, John Cena, from whom Edge won the World Heavyweight Championship at the previous month's pay per view, No Way Out (in the Elimination Chamber match), interfered with the signing before whispering a message in Vickie's ear prompting the signing to be canceled. The next week on \"Raw\", Vickie announced to the surprise of Edge and Big Show that Cena would be in the match, thus making it a Triple Threat match. It was soon revealed that the match would involve the new challenger based on Cena extorting Guerrero with footage of the general manager having adulterous relations with Big Show. The next week on \"Raw\", Edge, Vickie and Big Show were set to confront Cena due to Cena revealing the affair between Vickie and Big Show, much to the chagrin of all three. As a result, Guerrero arranged a match pitting Edge against Cena with herself serving as a special guest referee. With all that misdirected hostility focused on Cena, who could not touch Vickie or he would sacrifice his World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania, a lopsided confrontation seemed inevitable. As Edge and Cena battled, Big Show walked down the ramp toward the ring. When he arrived, Edge joined him in tying Cena up within the ring ropes. Fittingly, each drove their anger in his direction: Edge speared him, Vickie slapped him and Big Show drove his giant fist into Cena's ribs several times before clocking him in the jaw. Edge then speared Big Show and sent a message that he would retain his title at WrestleMania.\nThe fifth annual Money in the Bank ladder match was announced for WrestleMania 25 on the February 23 episode of \"Raw\". The briefcase holds a symbolic contract which the holder would be able to exchange for a WWE, World Heavyweight, or ECW Championship match at any time or location of his choosing up until one year. To participate in the match, a wrestler had to first qualify for it by winning a match; this process began on the February 23 episode of \"Raw\", in which CM Punk qualified by defeating The Miz and John Morrison in a Triple Threat match. The next week of \"Raw\", Kane defeated Rey Mysterio and Mike Knox in another Triple Threat match. The next night on \"ECW\", Mark Henry qualified for the match by defeating Santino Marella. Both Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Shelton Benjamin qualified for the match on the March 6 episode of \"SmackDown\" by defeating Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy in respective singles matches. On the March 9 episode of \"Raw\", Kofi Kingston qualified by defeating Chris Jericho. Christian qualified the next night on \"ECW\" by winning a battle royal when he last eliminated Chavo Guerrero Jr. Finlay was the final wrestler to qualify for the match when he defeated The Brian Kendrick on the March 13 episode of \"SmackDown\". Over the following weeks, the participants competed in eight-man tag team matches and an eight-man battle royal.\nThe buildup to WrestleMania 25 also included a rivalry between brothers Matt and Jeff Hardy. During Jeff's match against Edge at the Royal Rumble for the WWE Championship, Matt came down to the ring, appearing to help his brother. Instead, Matt turned on Jeff by hitting him with a steel chair, costing Jeff the match and his WWE title. After losing his Money in the Bank qualifying match to MVP on the March 6 episode of \"SmackDown\", Matt interfered in Jeff's qualifying match later that night by punching Jeff's opponent, Shelton Benjamin, disqualifying Jeff from the match. A week later, Matt provoked Jeff even further by referring to Jeff's recent accidents, including Jeff's incident at the night of Survivor Series where he was found unconscious in a hotel stairwell (which caused him to be removed of the WWE Championship match and being replaced by Edge at that event), the recent account of someone driving Jeff off the road, and the misfiring of the pyrotechnics in his entrance. Matt then talked about the fire to Jeff's house a year prior, killing his dog Jack. This ultimately led to Jeff retaliating against his brother after weeks of passive resistance. Later that night, it was announced that Matt and Jeff would fight each other at WrestleMania with a subsequent announcement a week later declaring the match to be held under Extreme Rules.\nOn the January 23 episode of \"SmackDown\", WWE Tag Team Champions The Colóns (Primo and Carlito) defeated World Tag Team Champions John Morrison and The Miz in a tag team match. After their loss, Miz and Morrison proceeded to harass their defeaters on their weekly Internet show, the \"Dirt Sheet\", as well as profess the brothers' impotence towards their associates, The Bella Twins. The two teams wrestled again on the February 13 episode of \"SmackDown\", with the winning team earning a date with the Bellas. Miz and Morrison won the rematch and the date. The two teams continued their feud in the coming weeks, and while the initial focus of the feud was the competition for the Bella Twins, the feud took on a dual purpose as each team successfully defended their respective titles in subsequent matches with both teams retaining their respective belts; it was announced on the March 17 episode of \"ECW\" that the WWE and World Tag Team titles would be unified at WrestleMania into what would be called the \"Unified WWE Tag Team Championship\".\nAt the 15th Screen Actors Guild Awards, actor Mickey Rourke, who gained critical acclaim at the time for his role in the film \"The Wrestler\", had announced he would be competing at WrestleMania, specifically targeting Chris Jericho. The announcement led to a storyline confrontation between the two on \"Larry King Live\", which showed signs of second thoughts from Rourke. On January 28, it was announced Rourke's spokesperson that the actor would not compete at the event, but would still be in attendance. Jericho's narrative subsequently evolved towards one of the themes from \"The Wrestler\", which was the respect for older wrestlers after their careers start to decline, of which Jericho disapproved. On the February 9 episode of \"Raw\", Ric Flair appeared to protest Jericho's tirades, professing that the wrestlers should be respected, as they had paved the way for the future generations to make a living, leading to a heated exchange between the two. Over the coming weeks, Jericho was confronted by a number of legends including Roddy Piper, Ricky Steamboat, and Jimmy Snuka on an episode of \"Piper's Pit\" hosted by Jericho himself. Each confrontation resulted in Jericho viciously attacking each respective wrestler. The following week, Jericho challenged Flair to a match. Although Flair declined (honoring his retirement from active competition), he offered to be in the corner of Piper, Steamboat, and Snuka for their challenge against Jericho in a handicap match. Jericho accepted the challenge, but subsequently attacked and bloodied Flair.\nEvent.\nDark match.\nBefore the event was aired live, the crowd in attendance were treated to a dark match, which featured the WWE Tag Team Champions The Colóns (Carlito and Primo) compete against the World Tag Team Champions John Morrison and The Miz in a Winner Takes All Lumberjack match, which has a number of wrestlers surround the ring in order to keep any competitor from avoiding the match, to unify the World Tag Team Championship and WWE Tag Team Championship. The Colóns won the encounter after Primo executed the Backstabber on Morrison.\nAs the event went live on pay-per-view and right before the opening pyro, Nicole Scherzinger sang \"America the Beautiful\".\nPreliminary matches.\nThe Money in the Bank ladder match was the start of the event as the participants: CM Punk, Kane, Mark Henry, MVP, Shelton Benjamin, Kofi Kingston, Christian, and Finlay, fought for the briefcase that was suspended over the ring. The match was littered with many notable moments, including a series of the match's combatants performing dives onto the floor of the arena onto each other, as well as Benjamin diving off of the top of a ladder with a senton bomb onto his opponents. The ladder was also used as a weapon by the competitors, which saw it being thrown at each other or, in the case of Kingston, to be used as extra force dropped on their chest as Kofi incapacitated them by draping the collapsed ladder over their bodies and leg dropping onto the ladder. The finish came with Punk and Kane on top of the ladder, which saw Punk execute a series of kicks on Kane from atop the ladder, knocking him off. Punk went on to win the match after he grabbed the hanging briefcase. Punk's victory marked his second consecutive victory in the match.\nAfter the match, Kid Rock performed a live medley of songs: \"Bawitdaba\", \"Rock N Roll Jesus\", \"Cowboy\", \"All Summer Long\", and \"So Hott\". During the last song, the female competitors of the WWE would come to the ring to compete in a 25-Diva battle royal, to crown \"Miss WrestleMania\". The match featured Divas that were employed by WWE at the time and Divas that had worked for WWE in the past. Santino Marella, who portrayed a diva called \"Santina\", his twin sister, won the match and was crowned \"Miss WrestleMania\". Mae Young acted as the special guest timekeeper of the match while Candice Michelle was the one who gave the sash and crown to Santina.\nThe next match featured Chris Jericho facing Ricky Steamboat, Jimmy Snuka, and Roddy Piper (who were accompanied to the ring by Ric Flair) in a three-on-one handicap elimination match. Before long, Jericho had caused Snuka to submit the Walls of Jericho. He then pinned Piper after an enzuigiri. Steamboat, however, would outlast his partners as he was able to execute a number of his signature moves including arm drags, chops, and a plancha. Jericho was able to regain control of the match by connecting with the Codebreaker, pinning Steamboat to win the match. After the match, Jericho challenged Mickey Rourke, sitting at ringside, to come into the ring. Rourke finally entered the ring and knocked Jericho onto the canvas with a punch before being commended by Ric Flair.\nThe fourth bout was the Extreme Rules match between brothers Jeff and Matt Hardy. This featured a multitude of moments that saw the Hardys assault each other with many different weapon-based attacks, which included assaults with numerous objects under the ring and Jeff splash from the top turnbuckle through a pair of tables, with Matt sandwiched between the two and a chair. Jeff, seeking to end the match, attempted to set up a ladder for him to ascend while he would perform a maneuver similar to a leapfrog over the hurdle, and diving down in a seated position known as a leapfrog leg drop, ultimately missing his target, due to Matt's last-minute dodge, which resulted in Matt gaining the advantage over his brother. He then forced Jeff's head in between the seat and back of a steel chair, then executed the Twist of Fate with Jeff's head in the chair to win the match via pinfall.\nA singles match for the Intercontinental Championship was next, in which Rey Mysterio faced defending champion John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield. Before the match started, JBL kicked Mysterio and punched him down to the ground for a few seconds. But once the referee started the match, Mysterio surprised JBL by quickly executing the 619 before pinning him for a win via pinfall in twenty-two seconds. Following the match, a frustrated JBL grabbed a microphone and proclaimed, \"I quit!\". This has been JBL's last singles match as an active performer. The match marked the first time since WrestleMania X8 that the Intercontinental Championship has been defended at a WrestleMania event.\nMain event matches.\nThe next match pitted The Undertaker against Shawn Michaels. Michaels made his entrance descending on a platform to symbolize the light; in sharp contrast, The Undertaker entered second, ascending from the floor with fire shooting up from the stage. The match began with a fast pace by both men going for strikes to have them countered before Michaels feigned a knee injury to gain the advantage, and the pace slowed. This led to an exchange of signature moves and submission holds, which saw Michaels escape The Undertaker's Hell's Gate and dodge multiple attempts at the chokeslam while Undertaker blocked attempts at Michaels' Sweet Chin Music. The action went to the outside of the ring with Michaels attempting a moonsault, only to have The Undertaker avoid the attempt. This led to The Undertaker attempting a suicide dive over the top rope, only to have Michaels pull the nearby cameraman (played by Sim Snuka) into Undertaker. The spot, however, did not go as intended. The idea was for Michaels to push the referee out of the way, and pull Snuka into the path of Undertaker and for Snuka to catch Undertaker before he hit the ground. However, Snuka was standing too far back and Undertaker landed almost head first on the protective mats surrounding the ring. He remained on the floor of the arena for some time, while Michaels revived the referee, rolling him back into the ring and having the referee start to count out the Undertaker. The referee began to count as the Undertaker started to revive, and when the official got to the count of 9, Undertaker rolled into the ring, managing to beat the count of 10. The match continued with both men performing all of their respective finishing moves. The Undertaker executed the Last Ride and chokeslam, Michaels executed Sweet Chin Music twice and Undertaker executed a Tombstone Piledriver on Michaels – all of which scored near-falls. Undertaker won the match after Michaels attempted another moonsault only to be caught in mid-air, and landed into another Tombstone Piledriver. As a result of this victory, The Undertaker remained undefeated at WrestleMania, extending his record to 17–0. Throughout the match, fans were split, chanting for both superstars, and at one point chanted \"This is awesome\", referring to the match itself.\nThe World Heavyweight Championship was contested for in a Triple Threat match between the champion, Edge, Big Show, and John Cena, who entered through an aisle of look-alikes to start the match; Vickie Guerrero was brought out to ringside in a wheelchair by Chavo Guerrero Jr. due to her emotional investment in both Edge and Big Show. The action began with some brawling and some early teamwork from Big Show and Edge before their alliance crumbled. The match spilled to the outside seeing Edge spear Big Show through the guardrail. Cena returned Edge to the ring before applying the STF before Big Show came to his senses, and broke up the action, leading to Cena and Edge teaming up to remove Big Show from the equation before turning on each other. Cena won the match by lifting both Big Show and Edge at the same exact time and set up the Attitude Adjustment on Big Show, then dropping Edge onto Big Show with the same move before pinning Big Show to win his second World Heavyweight Championship.\nNext after that, the 2009 WWE Hall of Fame class was introduced in this order by Justin Roberts: Terry and Dory Funk Jr., \"Cowboy\" Bill Watts, Howard Finkel, Koko B. Ware, the Von Erich family (represented by Kevin Von Erich), Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat, and Stone Cold Steve Austin. After the introductions were made, Austin drove to ringside and all around the ring in an ATV, and toasted the fans with beer.\nThe last match of the event was for the WWE Championship; the match was contested between the champion, Triple H, and Randy Orton. As per a pre-match stipulation by Vickie Guerrero, if Triple H had been disqualified or had been counted out during the match, he would have lost the title to Orton. The champion had his signature weapon, the sledgehammer, in hand only to relinquish it prior to entering the ring by throwing it through a glass wall. Early in the match, Triple H did everything in his power to hurt Orton without being disqualified in the process. Orton performed a Back Body Drop to Triple H onto the Spanish announce table. At one point, Orton threw Triple H to a turnbuckle where the referee was standing, causing him to collide, and knocked out the referee. After executing an RKO on Triple H, Orton tried to gain more advantage and went out of the ring to pick up Triple H's signature weapon, the sledgehammer. As Orton made his way back to the ring, Triple H delivered a punt kick to Orton. Triple H took his sledgehammer from Orton, hit him with it and executed the Pedigree to retain the WWE Championship.\nReception.\nWrestleMania 25 received mixed reviews from various sources. Gordon Holmes of Comcast criticized the mini-concert by Kid Rock, stating that \"Kid Rock gets ten minutes and The Miz and Morrison don't? Blasphemy!\" He also criticized the 25-Divas Battle Royal which \"was a bit of a mess, we didn't even get proper introductions for returning Divas like Sunny, Molly Holly, and Torrie Wilson.\" Dale Plummer of Canadian Online Explorer's Slam! Sports stated that \"the top of this year's card looked an awful lot like last year's. Just swap out Floyd Mayweather Jr. for Shawn Michaels and everyone else was the same.\" However, he praised the Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels match by rating it a ten out of ten, his highest rated match. The main event received a seven out of ten. Overall, he rated the event 7.5 out of ten. Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter also criticized Kid Rock's performance, but praised the Undertaker vs. Michaels match. He rated it five out of five, and stated that \"the match that deserved to end this show was Taker-Michaels.\" IGN offered their own review of WrestleMania 25, with IGN TV writer Dan Iverson praising Kofi Kingston, Shawn Michaels, and Ricky Steamboat for their performances, but also criticizing WWE for not showing the Tag Team unification match during the event itself. He finished off the review by stating: \"It was just too bad that the potential of the card wasn't lived up to\", also giving it an overall rating of seven out of 10. Arash Markazi of \"Sports Illustrated\" wrote that Mickey Rourke's appearance \"may have been one of the worst executed in WrestleMania history.\"\nThe Randy Orton vs. Triple H main event was generally regarded by critics as a disappointing ending to the show. Holmes of Comcast.net believes that the match \"never seemed to click\" and Kevin Eck of \"The Baltimore Sun\" stated that he was \"disappointed that it didn’t feel more special after some great angles on TV.\" Nick Tywalk of Slam! Wrestling wrote that it was \"solid and had its share of drama, but the lack of outside interference or plot twists of any kind failed to spark the same feeling of energy Reliant Stadium had in it a few hours before. It was almost a \"That's it?\" reaction that first came to mind.\" Wade Keller gave the match 3.75 out of 5. He called the match \"good, both well-plotted and well-executed, appropriate to the storyline and feud\", but added that \"it just wasn't able to follow the classic two matches earlier.\"\nThe match between The Undertaker and Shawn Michaels is widely acclaimed, earning the 2009 Match of the Year award from both Pro Wrestling Illustrated and the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, as well as Match of the Year at the 2009 WWE Slammy Awards. Regarded as one of the greatest matches in the history of professional wrestling, Bret Hart called it \"one of the best matches I've seen in years\", while Triple H, Tony Schiavone, and Shane Taylor have dubbed it the greatest ever, as well as publications such as Bleacher Report. Jim Ross stated he had \"never seen a more psychologically compelling match than Shawn and Taker had that night\" and Arn Anderson said \"If you want to sit down and put up with somebody who’s never seen a wrestling match, and you want them to have a favorable impression, show them that match.” Dave Meltzer gave the match 4 and 3/4 stars out of 5 but stated that he felt \"there was a predictableness to it\" which prevented it from being a 5-star match. Undertaker affirmed that both he and Michaels \"delivered on every aspect of storytelling and match quality\", and Michaels himself called the match \"the most perfect, beautiful thing I've ever performed inside a wrestling ring in my life\". WWE ranked it at the top of their list of \"The 100 best matches to see before you die\".\nAftermath.\nThe rivalry between Triple H and Randy Orton continued after WrestleMania when both men would meet in a six-man tag team match at Backlash on the following episode of \"Raw\". The match would pit Triple H, Shane McMahon and Vince McMahon against The Legacy (Orton with his protégés, Ted DiBiase Jr. and Cody Rhodes). Vince's part in the match was later replaced by a returning Batista. At Backlash, Randy Orton and The Legacy defeated Triple H, Shane, and Batista for the WWE Championship. Triple H was put out of action after being punted by Orton after the events of the pay-per-view, while Shane was attacked by Legacy and was taken out on a stretcher. Two months later, Batista later suffered the same fate and was taken out of the building by security, while Triple H made his return and continued his feud with Randy Orton. They would later battle in a Last Man Standing match on Raw for the WWE Championship which went to a no contest, then at The Bash, Randy Orton defeated Triple H in a Three Stages of Hell match, and would later end their feud in a triple threat Match at Night of Champions, with Randy Orton retaining his title against both Triple H and John Cena. Orton would then begin a feud with Cena while Triple H would go out to re-unite DX.\nOn the same episode of \"Raw\", it was announced that Vickie Guerrero would vacate her role as SmackDown general manager to become the new permanent Raw general manager. As her first act, Guerrero announced that John Cena would defend his World Heavyweight Championship at Backlash against Edge in a Last Man Standing match.\nThe animosity between Matt and Jeff Hardy continued on the episode of \"SmackDown\" following WrestleMania, leading to continued assaults between the two; newly appointed SmackDown general manager, Theodore Long would announce one last match between the two at Backlash, an \"I Quit\" match.\nCM Punk would be drafted to the \"SmackDown\" brand, which would see him try on multiple occasions to invoke his contractually-guaranteed title match from winning the Money in the Bank ladder match; Punk would be able to get his match at Extreme Rules in June by defeating Jeff Hardy to win the World Heavyweight Championship. Prior to CM Punk defeating Jeff Hardy, Hardy was involved in a World Heavyweight Championship ladder match with Edge. Hardy had managed to trap Edge between the ladder, climb it, and retrieve the hanging belt. It was at this point that CM Punk cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase. As the briefcase guaranteed a title shot, CM Punk capitalized from an exhausted Jeff Hardy. CM Punk had hit the \"GTS\" (Go to Sleep) yet remarkably Hardy kicked out. CM Punk then hit a second one to win the World Heavyweight Championship.\nAfter the events of WrestleMania, both Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker took a four-month hiatus from the WWE. Shawn came back to reform D-Generation X (D-X) with Triple H so that they came face to face with The Legacy at SummerSlam. The Undertaker also returned at SummerSlam and attacked the then-World Heavyweight Champion, CM Punk. At the Slammy Awards, The Undertaker and Shawn Michaels won the Best Match of the Year, with Michaels expressing that he was glad that he had created history at WrestleMania, but just when he was about to leave, he challenged the Undertaker to a rematch at the next WrestleMania. The Undertaker later denied the challenge, saying he had nothing more to prove to Michaels, and told Michaels that he would have to earn the spot. Michaels later entered the 2010 Royal Rumble, but would be eliminated by Batista. He later tried to enter the Elimination Chamber match for the WWE Championship, but he was defeated by Randy Orton to earn the spot. Then at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, Michaels cost The Undertaker his World Heavyweight Championship. The next night on \"Raw\", The Undertaker accepted the rematch, but only on the condition that Michaels would retire from WWE if he lost. At WrestleMania XXVI, The Undertaker defeated Michaels in a Streak vs. Career Match, thus ending Michaels' career. The next night on \"Raw\", Michaels said farewell to WWE, with his best friend and D-X member Triple H right next to him as they spent their last time, together before Michaels finally left the building.\nWrestleMania 25 was the last WrestleMania to feature the ECW brand, and subsequently the ECW Championship, as the brand was disbanded in February 2010, deactivating the championship along with it."

        "text": "The 2007 Blue Square UK Open was the fifth year of the PDC's UK Open darts tournament where, following numerous regional qualifying heats throughout Britain, players competed in a single elimination tournament to be crowned champion. The tournament took place at the Reebok Stadium, Bolton, England, between 7–10 June 2007. Blue Square took over as title sponsor after Budweiser's three-year deal expired.\nThere were two changes being introduced this year where a tournament bracket was introduced from the quarter-final stage to prevent players being forced into playing long back-to-back matches. Previously there had been a random draw after each round and the tournament had earned the nickname the \"FA Cup of darts\" as a result. The number of players was expanded from 128 to 168 for the 2007 tournament, but due to players tied on 168th position in the Order of Merit the starting field was 176 players.\nRaymond van Barneveld defended his title, by defeating fellow Dutchman Vincent van der Voort 16–8 in the final.\nFormat.\nQualifying events are held at Punch Taverns pubs across the UK – winners from each pub event progress to one of four Regional Finals, to be staged in their relevant area. Players who reach the final eight in the Regional Finals will qualify for the televised stages of the UK Open in Bolton.\nIn addition there are eight UK Open Regional Finals for the \"professional\" players. All events are open to all darts players on payment of an entry fee – which means that players from both the PDC and BDO are eligible to enter. Players who enter through the Punch Taverns Qualifying round are not eligible to play in the regional qualifying events and vice versa.\nThe results of the eight qualifiers are then collated into an Order of Merit table (winner £4000; runner-up £2000; 3–4 £1000; 5–8 £500; 9–16 £250; 17–32 £100; 33–64 £50). This was raised to winner £5000; runner-up £2500; 3–4 £1250; 5–8 £600; 9–16 £300; 17–32 £150; 33–64 £75 from January 2007. The top 128 players (plus ties) in this Order of Merit join the 32 Punch Taverns qualifiers at the televised stages in Bolton.\nThe format for the event changes in 2007 to allow the tournament to expand by an extra day, and increase the number of players in the field.\n16 Matches drawn from a pool of 32 Punch Taverns Qualifiers and the 31 players with £50 or £75 in UK Open Order of Merit\n32 Matches with 16 Preliminary round survivors, the remaining 31 players who were not drawn in Preliminary round and players ranked 97–113 in UK Open Order of Merit\nPlayers ranked 65 to 96 join the first round winners.\nPlayers ranked 33 to 64 join the second round winners.\nPlayers ranked in the top 32 join the third round winners.\nLast 32 of competition\nLast 16 of competition followed by draw for quarter-finals in bracket form to avoid players being drawn in consecutive matches.\nUK Open Regional Final results.\nThe UK Open Order of Merit was based on the results of the eight qualifying events across the UK. The eight final results were:-\nResults.\nCollated results from later stages:-\nFourth round.\nRandom draws were made after each round up to the quarter-final stage; draw bracket has been compiled retrospectively.\nTournament Review.\nDay One – Thursday 7 June 2007.\nThe first round was played on Thursday and featured 81 players competing for a place in the second round. Winmau World Masters champion Michael van Gerwen, playing his first match on Sky Television in the UK, beat 37-year-old Chris McTernan a pub qualifier from Bacup. Former World Champion Richie Burnett and Cliff Lazarenko also played on the opening day – both progressing to the second round.\nDay Two – Friday 8 June 2007.\nThere were very few shocks on day two of the tournament, although former world champions Bob Anderson and Keith Deller, who were both struggling for form, were both knocked out. Cliff Lazarenko's run in the event ended in the third round. The draw for the fourth round, featuring the top 32 players in the world was staged at the end of Friday's play.\nDay Three – Saturday 9 June 2007.\n64 players remained when matches got underway on Saturday afternoon, after a late night on Friday. Raymond Barneveld would book a place in Round 5 with an 11–1 win over John \"Mr. Magoo\" MaGowan, who he defeated 11–7 in the Semi-finals twelve months ago. It was a different story against John Part with less doubles hit for Barney (compared to 80% against MaGowan). Part led 10–9, but van Barneveld squeezed through to hit double 16 and edge a great match 11–10.\nPhil Taylor achieved his third nine dart finish at Bolton in the fifth round against Wes Newton – it is also his fifth televised perfect game. Taylor was playing on the second main stage and whilst his match was in progress Colin Osborne was on his way to an 11–7 victory against Michael van Gerwen, including a 170 finish within moments of Taylor hitting the nine-darter. Osborne also saw off Mervyn King 11–10 – his second deciding leg victory of the day to reach the quarter-finals. Kevin Painter came within one dart of matching Phil Taylor's nine-darter missing double 12 for the finish which would have been the first time that a tournament had witnessed two nine-darters on the same day.\nThe draw for the final day's matches took place at the end of Saturday's play and the quarter-final line-up featured a repeat of the previous year's quarter-final between Phil Taylor and Raymond van Barneveld.\nDay Four – Sunday 10 June 2007.\nThe tournament reached the quarter-finals stage and the first match on the main board saw Vincent van der Voort come from 0–5 behind to edge out Premier League finalist Terry Jenkins 11–10 to reach his first PDC semi-final. Colin Osborne beat Alan Green 11–6 on board two. Colin Lloyd followed on board two with another comeback, having been 0–4 behind he beat Steve Hine 11–6.\nThe clash between the world's top two ranked players ended with a convincing victory for Raymond van Barneveld against Phil Taylor. Van Barneveld won four successive legs from 3–2 up and then further extended his lead to 9–3. Taylor took the 13th leg when he took out 182 with a usual combination of a maximum 180 and double one on his next visit. But van Barneveld won the next leg to win 11–4 and give Taylor one of his heaviest defeats on television.\nVincent van der Voort produced a second successive 11–10 win to reach the final by beating Colin Osborne in the semi-final whilst defending champion Raymond van Barneveld had a more comfortable win 11–4 over Colin Lloyd – meaning he'd beaten his two rivals in the top three of the world rankings on the same day. In the final, van Barneveld raced to a 4–0 win hitting his double on the first attempt each time before van der Voort managed to get two legs on the scoreboard. Van Barneveld then took the next four legs, then further extended his lead to 13–5. Van der Voort tried to stay with van Barneveld and took three of the next five legs but a double top in the 24th leg sealed a second successive UK Open title for van Barneveld."

        "text": "The men's points race was an event at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. There were 23 participants from 23 nations competing in the final, which was held on 20 September 2000. Each nation was limited to one cyclist in the event. The event was won by Joan Llaneras of Spain, the nation's first medal in the men's points race. Silver went to Milton Wynants of Uruguay and bronze to Aleksei Markov of Russia; those nations also earned their first medals in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the sixth appearance of the event. It was first held in 1900 and not again until 1984; after that, it was held every Summer Games until 2008 when it was removed from the programme. The women's version was held from 1996 through 2008.\n12 of the 28 cyclists from the 1996 Games, including all three medalists, returned: gold medalist Silvio Martinello of Italy, silver medalist Brian Walton of Canada, bronze medalist Stuart O'Grady of Australia, fourth-place finisher (and 1992 finalist) Vasyl Yakovlev of Ukraine, sixth-place finisher Joan Llaneras of Spain, seventh-place finisher Cho Ho-Sung of South Korea, tenth-place finisher Sergey Lavrenenko of Kazakhstan, eleventh-place finisher Milton Wynants of Uruguay, twelfth-place finisher Franz Stocher of Austria, seventeenth-place finisher Bruno Risi of Switzerland, twenty-third-place finisher Juan Curuchet of Argentina, and non-finisher Marlon Pérez of Colombia. Llaneras was the 1996 World Champion, with Martinello taking third. In 1997, those positions were reversed: Martinello won his third World Championship, with Llaneras in third. They flipped places again in 1998. Bruno Risi of Switzerland was the 1999 (reigning) World Champion, however.\nHong Kong made its debut in the event. France and Italy both competed for the sixth time, the only nations to have competed in all six Olympic men's points races.\nCompetition format.\nWith only 23 cyclists competing in 2000, only a final was held. The distance was the 40 kilometres introduced in 1996, but the number of sprints was reduced from 20 to 16. Placement was determined first by how many laps behind the leader the cyclist was and second by how many sprint points the cyclist accumulated. That is, a cyclist with more sprint points but who was lapped once would be ranked behind a cyclist with fewer points but who had not been lapped. Sprint points could be gained only by cyclists who had not been lapped.\nThere were 16 sprints—one every 2.5 kilometres (10 laps). Points were awarded based on the position of the cyclists at the end of the sprint. Most of the sprints were worth 5 points for the leader, 3 to the second-place cyclist, 2 to third, and 1 to fourth. The final sprint was worth double: 10 points, 6, 4, and 2."

        "text": "Curlew Rowing Club is a rowing club based on the Tideway of the River Thames at Greenwich, London, England. It was founded in 1866 and has been in Greenwich without interruption for over 130 years, though not always called Curlew.\nHistory.\nThe first regatta at which a “Curley” crew is believed to have rowed was held at Greenwich in 1787. In the first half of the 19th century “Curley” was one of several crews, along with a crew called “The Argonauts”, who had their own boats in the Greenwich and Deptford reaches. The Argonauts grew substantially in numbers until some of its members transferred their activities to Putney, to form the London Rowing Club with the object of rowing at Henley.\nThe “Curley” crew remained in Greenwich and in 1866 a club was formed in order to rent the (now demolished) Crown Sceptre Pub in Greenwich. “Curley”, by this stage had become “Curlew” and had incorporated the residue of the “Argonauts” and another crew “Lurline” who had been unable to carry on independently. Curlew then occupied the \"Crown and Sceptre\" until the building was demolished in 1934. So after 68 years Curlew moved to the \"Trafalgar Tavern\" where Curlew had a Club room / bar and a small basement gym. These premises where leased at that time from the Greenwich Hospital Estates.\nModern day.\nCurlew Rowing Club is now based in out of the Trafalgar Rowing Centre only a few doors down from their old home. Curlew moved to the Trafalgar Rowing Centre in late 2003, and with the Trafalgar Trust (Curlew Rowing Club and Globe Rowing Club) now own a new boathouse and gym in Greenwich. Furthermore, on the water training takes place at the London Regatta Centre based at the Victoria and Albert Docks, where Curlew has access to a complete multi-laned buoyed 2 km racing lake. Recently some boats have been relocated to Greenwich to train on the River Thames again.\nCurlew has had much success on the water qualifying and competing at Henley Royal Regatta most years since 2000. 2011 saw the club qualify two VIIIs to The Thames Challenge Cup, the first time in the club's history and the first time a club east of Putney has done so. In 2016 Curlew Rowing Club won the Ampthill Cup for elite pairs at The Metropolitan Regatta, this is the first time and only time Curlew Rowing Club have won this event.\nFurther to the success of the Men's squad, the Women reached the quarter final of Women's Henley, and the Women's Senior Double achieving Bronze at the National Championship of Great Britain.\nResults.\nHenley Royal Regatta.\nCurlew Rowing Club have qualified for Henley Royal Regatta 18 out of 22 seasons since 2000, making Thursday on a number of occasions during this period. In 2011 and 2012 Curlew have managed to qualify both a 1st and 2nd VIII into the Thames Challenge Cup, a feat only matched by Thames Rowing Club in West London."

        "text": "Bobby Reid (born December 13, 1985) is a former American football quarterback. He played college football at Texas Southern University and Oklahoma State University. Reid played high school football at Galena Park North Shore High School in Houston, where he led his team to the Class 5A Division I Championship his senior year. He was named Houston Touchdown Club's Offensive Player of the Year, and was named the all-Greater Houston, all-district and the district's Most Valuable Player.\nHigh school.\nReid was one of the top quarterback prospects in the country when he started his senior year at North Shore Senior High School. He was a dual threat quarterback who led his team to an unbeaten championship season and the Class 5A Division I Championship. He ran for three touchdowns in the 23-7 championship win over The Woodlands, and threw a pass to set up a touchdown run.\nIn his senior year he accounted for 38 touchdowns, 22 passing and 16 rushing, and a combined 2,650 yards.\nReid was named the Houston Touchdown Club's Offensive Player of the Year, and the All-Greater Houston, All-District and the district's Most Valuable Player. He was named to the national and Texas Top 100 recruiting lists, and attended the Elite 11 Quarterback Camp in California.\nCollege career.\nReid sat out his red-shirt year in 2004 after breaking his shoulder in practice, but started five games as a red-shirt freshman the following autumn until a mid-season injury.\nHe finished 2005 with 602 yards on 52 of 108 passing with two touchdowns and four interceptions. He also had 61 carries for 139 yards rushing and five receptions for 24 yards.\nReid played in all of Oklahoma State's 2006 games in which the Cowboys went 7 and 6, including an Independence Bowl victory over Alabama.\nThe high point of Reid's sophomore season came in the Cowboys shoot out victory over Kansas. Reid scored all of the Cowboys' touchdowns throwing for 411 yards and five touchdowns, while also running in a touchdown as Oklahoma State ran out 42–32 victors. The low point of his season came as he was benched in the second half of the Cowboys' loss to in-state rival Oklahoma.\nReid ended the season with 2,226 yards, 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.\nReid was one of the 35 quarterbacks placed on the 2007 Manning Award watch list. However, that same year he was demoted to back-up quarterback. This led to a media controversy surrounding comments made by OSU coach Mike Gundy.\nFollowing the 2007 college football season, Reid flirted with the idea of declaring for the NFL Draft but instead chose to transfer to Texas Southern, a D1 FCS school that finished 0–11 in 2007.\nIn 2008, Reid's stats for Texas Southern were admirable considering he did not finish the season because of a knee injury. He threw for 148-261 for 1791 yards and 12 TDs with 6 INTS and only 8 sacks. He finished his college career with 4,934 yards and 39 TDs.\nProfessional career.\nIn the spring of 2009 It was reported that Bobby Reid had a pro day work out at University of Texas–Arlington. Five NFL team representatives were there to watch the workout. Due to an ACL injury could only throw passes. Reid impressed the scouts with his arm. \"Reid threw the ball real well\", Titans head scout Brocato said. \"He's got a very good arm, and he's big 6-foot 3.\"\nOn March 15, 2010, Reid worked as the throwing quarterback at the LSU pro football timing day. He also ran the athletic drills, posting times of 4.67 and 4.64 seconds in the 40-yard dash, posting a 33½-inch vertical jump, a 9-3 broad jump, a 4.41 second short shuttle drill and 19 reps at 225 lbs. on the bench press.\nIn 2010, Reid signed with the Tulsa Talons, wearing number 7.\nIn 2011, Reid played several games for the Tulsa Talons, and led the team in rushing with 312 yds and 13 TDs on 32 carries.\nReid's 2011 Tulsa Talons Statistics\nOn February 18, 2013, Oklahoma State hired Bobby Reid in an administrative, non-coaching position.\nOn January 8, 2015, Reid left OSU for SMU.

        "title": "Generation K (baseball)",
        "text": "Generation K were a baseball trio of young starting pitchers in the New York Mets organization in 1995, consisting of Bill Pulsipher, Jason Isringhausen, and Paul Wilson. Generation X was a hot topic in American media during the mid-1990s and the nickname came from the use of \"K\" to denote a strikeout in baseball scorekeeping. The trio were highly regarded and were expected to lead the club back to the top of the National League East standings for the first time since the end of the Dwight Gooden/Darryl Strawberry era. The prospect of their success drew comparisons to past Mets pitching stars such as Seaver/ Koosman/ Matlack and Gooden/ Darling/ Fernandez. All three players succumbed to pitching-related injuries within a year, and eventually only Isringhausen would have a productive major-league career, primarily as a closer for the Oakland Athletics and St. Louis Cardinals.\nBill Pulsipher.\nBill Pulsipher arrived first, in June 1995, after pitching over 200 minor league innings as a 21-year-old. Between the majors and the minors in 1995 he threw for 218 more innings for a 3.98 ERA. Pulsipher missed all of 1996 and most of 1997 with a torn elbow ligament. After a brief comeback bid in 2001 it appeared his career had ended. During this period Pulsipher compiled a 13–19 record and a 5.13 ERA, never having an ERA below 3.98 in any season. Yet another comeback came in 2004; after a solid year with the independent Atlantic League's Long Island Ducks, he was signed by the Seattle Mariners’ AAA affiliate Tacoma Rainiers. He pitched well there, but after a back injury led to his release he returned to the Ducks, leading them to an Atlantic League Championship victory.\nIn 2005, he received a non-roster invitation from the St. Louis Cardinals on Jason Isringhausen’s recommendation, and joined a race for Steve Kline’s lefty specialist job that already included several competitors, like the established Mike Myers and touted prospect Carmen Cali.\nAt first he was considered a long shot, but after pitching well in Spring Training, Myers was traded and Pulsipher became the second left-handed pitcher out of the bullpen. Two members of Generation K were on the same team for the first time since 1996. Unfortunately, injuries and the emergence of Randy Flores led to a brief major league showing for Pulsipher; he spent most of the year with the AAA Memphis Redbirds, and retired after the 2005 season.\nJason Isringhausen.\nIsringhausen came next, in July 1995, and was the Mets’ best pitcher down the stretch with a 9–2 record and a 2.81 ERA. In 1996 he struggled with a pulled rib-cage muscle, bone spurs, and a torn labrum contributing to a 4.71 ERA. He had only six starts in 1997 and was ineffective before suffering a broken wrist. He missed all of 1998 recovering from reconstructive elbow surgery but was traded to the Oakland Athletics for reliever Billy Taylor and Kenny Rogers in the middle of 1999.\nOakland made Isringhausen their closer. He posted a 2.13 ERA in his half-season with Oakland. His 96 mph fastball and knuckle-curve moved so much and broke so sharply that he sometimes had trouble keeping them out of the dirt. In his prime he was one of the games best closers and was elected to the All Star game twice, in 2000 with the Athletics and 2005 with the St. Louis Cardinals. With the St. Louis Cardinals, from 2002 to 2008, he pitched a minimum of 42 innings per season with a maximum era of 3.55, though he topped out in 2008 with a 5.70 ERA in 42.2 innings; he posted ERAs below 2.50 in each of his first two seasons with the club and led the National League with 47 saves in 2004.\nInjuries eventually led to his release by the Cardinals after the 2008 season. He signed a minor league contract with the Tampa Bay Rays for the 2009 season. In earning his first decision of the 2009 season, Isringhausen topped off what was a catastrophic performance by the Tampa Bay Rays' bullpen. The Rays blew a 10–0 lead in Cleveland on May 25, 2009. Isringhausen faced 4 batters, gave up three straight walks and then the game-winning hit. Officially in the game, Izzy did not record an out. Gave up 1 hit, 3 walks, 0 strikeouts, 2 runs, both earned. He threw 23 pitches and only 9 were strikes - including the game-winning hit.\nAfter missing the 2010 season (save for a brief stint in the Cincinnati Reds organization), in February 2011, Isringhausen returned to the Mets, signing a minor league deal with the team. After spending time in the minors, Isringhausen performed well in his return to the Majors with the Mets and eventually landed the job of setup man for Mets closer Francisco Rodriguez. After Rodriguez was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers in the middle of the season, Isringhausen was slotted into the closer role and eventually earned his 300th save against the San Diego Padres.\nIsringhausen would then pitch the season with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Following the season, Isringhausen said that he is likely to retire, but has not formally done so. To date, his pitching line is 51–55 with a 3.64 ERA and 300 saves in 724 appearances.\nPaul Wilson.\nWith the first pick in the 1994 first-year player draft the Mets selected what many thought as the most promising member of the trio, college phenom Paul Wilson. Featuring a strong fastball/slider combo he made the majors in early 1996 after strong minor league numbers. He had often been accused of possessing poor mechanics, and the stress put on his pitching arm haunted him early. After pitching 187 innings in the minors the year before, he spent much of 1996 on the disabled list. Wilson returned to the major leagues in 2000 with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He spent 2003–2005 with the Cincinnati Reds. After spending all of the 2006 season in the minor leagues, Paul Wilson retired with a career Major League record of 40–58 and a 4.86 career ERA."

        "text": "James Richard \"Jungle Jim\" Martin (April 8, 1924 – October 9, 2002) was an American football guard, linebacker and placekicker who played fourteen seasons in the National Football League (NFL) in the 1950s and 1960s, mainly for the Detroit Lions. He was selected to the Pro Bowl, the NFL's all-star game, after the 1961 season, and went on to be an assistant coach after his playing career. He was an All-American at the University of Notre Dame and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1995.\nMartin was a star athlete at his high school in Cleveland, Ohio. He joined the United States Marine Corps after graduating, and served in the Pacific War until it ended in 1945. He then enrolled at Notre Dame, where he was part of a teams that won the college football national championship in 1946, 1947 and 1949 under head coach Frank Leahy. Martin was named a first-team All-American in 1949 by several news organizations.\nThe NFL's Cleveland Browns selected Martin in the 1950 draft, and he played there for one season during which the team won the NFL championship. Browns head coach Paul Brown traded him to the Detroit Lions, where he played between 1951 and 1961, at first as a guard and later as a linebacker and placekicker. The Lions won NFL championships in 1952, 1953 and 1957, all three of them victories over the Browns. After spending a year as an assistant coach for the Denver Broncos, an American Football League team, Martin returned to playing in 1963 for the Baltimore Colts, and played for a final year in 1964 for the Washington Redskins. When he left the Lions, Martin was the team's all-time leading field goal kicker; he also became the first NFL player to kick two field goals of more than 50 yards in a single game in 1960.\nMartin was an assistant high school coach in California and at Idaho State University before taking a job as an assistant with the Lions between 1967 and 1972. He also coached in the World Football League in the mid-1970s. Martin later worked as a court officer in Michigan. He was inducted into the Greater Cleveland Sports Hall of Fame in 1976 and into the college hall of fame in 1995. He died in 2002.\nEarly life and college.\nMartin grew up in Cleveland, Ohio and attended the city's East Technical High School, where he was captain of the football and swimming teams. He played center on the football team. After graduating, Martin joined the U.S. Marines during World War II, and served in the Pacific War. He was part of a small crew in the Marines' Fifth Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion that landed on the island of Tinian in 1944 to do preliminary scouting in preparation for its seizure by Allied forces in the Battle of Tinian. Wearing only black swim trunks, diving fins and face masks, Martin and his three-man unit discovered a string of sea mines near a beach where Allied forces were set to land, helping guide the invasion to safer landing places. He was awarded a Bronze Star for his service in the war.\nAfter the war ended in 1945, Martin returned to the U.S. and enrolled at the University of Notre Dame. Coached by Frank Leahy, who had met and recruited Martin during the war on Iwo Jima, Notre Dame won the college football national championship by finishing first in the AP Poll in both 1946 and 1947. Martin played as an end on the team, working on both offense and defense, and was nicknamed \"Jungle Jim\" because of his service in the jungles of the Pacific islands. Notre Dame finished the 1948 season with a 9–0–1 win–loss–tie record and ranked second in the AP Poll. Martin switched from end to left offensive and defensive tackle for the 1949 season, when Notre Dame again finished first in the polls and won a national championship. Notre Dame did not lose a game during Martin's tenure, although it tied twice. Martin, who was co-captain in 1949, was named a first-team All-American that year by the Associated Press, the Newspaper Enterprise Association and the \"International News Service\". He also boxed, and won Notre Dame's heavyweight title in 1949. The following summer, he played in the College All-Star Game, a now-defunct contest between the National Football League (NFL) champion and a selection of the country's best college players. He also played in the East–West Shrine Game, another college all-star game.\nProfessional career.\nThe Cleveland Browns of the NFL selected Martin in the second round of the 1950 draft. Led by an offense that featured quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley and ends Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie, Cleveland had won four championships in the All-America Football Conference leading up to the 1950 season, the team's first in the NFL. With Martin playing at defensive end, the Browns finished the 1950 season with a 10–2 record and beat the Los Angeles Rams to win the NFL championship. In a divisional playoff game against the New York Giants before the championship, Martin sacked Giants quarterback Charlie Conerly in his own end zone for a safety that helped secure a narrow 8–3 victory. The Rams scored a touchdown on their first play from scrimmage in the championship game, an 82-yard pass from Bob Waterfield to Glenn Davis. Martin was covering Davis and slipped on the play, although the Browns came back to win in the final seconds of the game.\nCleveland head coach Paul Brown orchestrated a trade in 1951 that sent Martin and four other players to the Detroit Lions in exchange for the Lions' first and sixteenth picks in the following year's draft, plus cash. With the Lions, Martin helped fill a gap left by the departure of defensive end Jim Cain for service in the Army. The team finished the 1951 season with a 7–4–1 record, good for second in the NFL's National division. Led by budding quarterback Bobby Layne and halfback Doak Walker, the Lions improved to 9–3 the following year, when Martin switched to left guard. The team went on to beat the Browns in the NFL championship. Another championship victory over the Browns followed in 1953, this time by a narrow 17–16 margin.\nDetroit finished the 1954 regular season on top of the NFL West and again faced the Browns in the championship game, but lost by a score of 56–10. Martin switched from guard to linebacker the following year, when Detroit had a losing record. The team improved in 1956 and won another NFL championship over the Browns in 1957. Martin stayed with the Lions through the 1961 season. A strong placekicker, Martin was used primarily on kickoffs and on field goals in his later seasons in Detroit. In 1960, he became the first player in NFL history to kick two field goals longer than 50 yards in one game. He was selected for the Pro Bowl, the NFL's annual all-star game, in 1961 after leading the team in scoring with 15 field goals and 25 extra points.\nMartin, who had become the Lions' all-time leading field goal kicker in 1961, left the team the following February to take a job as an assistant coach with the Denver Broncos, a team in the American Football League. He returned to playing in 1963 as a kicker for the Baltimore Colts, spending one year there. He then spent a final year kicking for the Washington Redskins before retiring as a player.\nCoaching career.\nAfter ending his playing career, Martin became an assistant coach at Mater Dei High School in California in 1965. After a year there, he became an assistant coach in 1966 at Idaho State University. The Lions then hired him as an assistant in 1967, and he stayed with his old team through the 1972 season. Martin subsequently coached for the Portland Storm in the World Football League between 1974 and 1975.\nLater life and death.\nLater in life, Martin served as an officer in Michigan's 48th Michigan District Courts. He was inducted into the Greater Cleveland Sports Hall of Fame in 1976 and into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1995. He died in 2002."

Despite the older and more experienced competition, Vanderbilt finished 2–2.\nSeason summary.\nSince 1893, unofficial games had been played by Vanderbilt teams and intramural basketball games were popular on campus during winter. Finally, in Autumn 1900, a team was formed to accept a challenge from the Nashville Y.M.C.A. to play a 3-game series. As the Old Gym on Vanderbilt's campus was too small to host the spectacle, all three games were played at the Y.M.C.A.'s gym.\nWalter Simmons, Earnest Reese, Tom Motlow, Herbert Gannaway and E.L. Woolf were the starters in the first game on December 15, 1900. After trailing 16–4 at halftime, the Commodores outscored the Y 15–4 in the second half to pull within 20–19, before losing 22–19. Vanderbilt routed the Y in the second game in February, 1901 by a score of 24–9. They secured a win in the deciding game in March, 1901 on a late goal 14–12.\nThe Commodores played the final game of their inaugural season against the Nashville Athletic Club, whose players were older and bigger. After trailing 10–5 at halftime, Walter Simmons, a four-year starter on the football team, led the Commodores back, but NAC won 13–11.\nHead Coach &amp; Captain.\nW.D. Weatherford was head coach, and Earnest Reese was team captain."

        "title": "Pat Williams (basketball)",
        "text": "Pat Williams (born May 3, 1940) is a former American sports executive, who most recently served as senior vice president of the Orlando Magic. Williams began his career as a minor league baseball player, and later joined the front office of his team. In the late 1960s he moved into basketball, with his biggest achievements being the 1983 title of the Philadelphia 76ers and being a partner in the creation of the Orlando Magic.\nEarly life.\nWilliams was born in 1940 in Philadelphia, the second oldest of four children and the only son. He was raised in Wilmington, Delaware, attending Tower Hill School where his father coached and taught. He became a friend of Ruly Carpenter, son of Philadelphia Phillies owner Bob \"R.R.M.\" Carpenter, who would bring Williams to the Phillies’ dugout and clubhouse, as well as to the team's spring training in Clearwater, Florida.\nHis interest in baseball would earn Williams a scholarship to Wake Forest University. There Williams earned a bachelor's degree in physical education in 1962 while being a catcher on the Demon Deacons baseball team. Williams would later earn a master's of science degree in physical education from Indiana University in 1964. Additionally, Pat served for seven years in the United States Army and later got a doctorate in Humane Letters from Flagler College.\nFormer Chicago White Sox owner Bill Veeck is credited by Williams as his mentor, with a visit to Veeck in 1962 starting their friendship and giving Williams principles followed in his career, such as \"Don’t announce promotions in advance, be out on the speaking circuit, stand at the gates when fans leave, open your own mail and don’t screen your calls\".\nBaseball career.\nWilliams' baseball career began when the Carpenters signed him in 1962 to the Miami Marlins, their minor league team in the Florida State League. He was a catcher for two years then retired and moved in to a front office role. Marlins general manager Bill Durney still saw in Williams an eager and natural leader with a marketing degree, and invited him to be the team's business manager. One year later, the Phillies appointed him to be the general manager of the Spartanburg Phillies. As the Phillies became a powerhouse of the Western Carolinas League, Williams was later elevated to the position of president of the organization in 1967, and was chosen the Minor League Executive of the Year by \"The Sporting News\". Afterwards he spent three years in the Minnesota Twins organization.\nEven after moving to basketball, Williams is still active in baseball—every winter, he plays in Major League Fantasy Camps. He was also president of Orlando's Double-A Southern League team from 1990 to 1993.\nBasketball management.\nWilliams moved into basketball in 1968, becoming the Philadelphia 76ers business manager. With promotions that included elaborate halftime shows and a successful 55-27 performance, the 76ers were third in attendance of the 1968–69 NBA season. Afterwards the faltering Chicago Bulls hired Williams to become their general manager. Williams immediately revamped the team's roster, trading with the Sixers for Chet Walker, and invested on the promotion, including the creation of mascot Benny the Bull. He succeeded Richie Guerin as general manager of the Atlanta Hawks on August 6, 1973, in that the Hawks had felt the need for a GM who specialized in promotion. He spent just one year in Atlanta, where his most notable action was trading star Pete Maravich for two players and five draft picks.\nAs the Sixers had become one of the worst teams in the NBA, owner Irv Kosloff invited Williams to return in 1974. Williams then remained in Philadelphia for 12 years as their general manager, helping to build the team that won the 1982–83 NBA season, by trading for Julius Erving and Moses Malone, and drafting Maurice Cheeks and Andrew Toney. Frustrated at his failure to build a 76ers dynasty despite bringing new talent such as Charles Barkley, Williams left the organization in 1986.\nAs the year before Orlando executive Jim Hewitt told Williams of his idea of bringing an NBA team to his city, he decided to join Hewitt's investment group. Williams invested in convincing NBA commissioner David Stern and the league owners of the viability of the small-town Florida city in supporting an NBA franchise. The league awarded the Orlando Magic an expansion spot in 1987, with the team making its debut in 1989. Serving as the franchise's inaugural manager, Williams helped the Magic reach the 1995 NBA Finals by drafting Shaquille O'Neal and trading a draft pick for Penny Hardaway. The following year, he was promoted to senior vice president of Magic parent company RDV Sports, Inc.\nIn his NBA career, Williams led his teams to 23 NBA Playoffs and five NBA Finals. He won four NBA draft lotteries, including back-to-back winners in 1992 and 1993 and most recently in 2004. Williams signed Billy Cunningham, Chuck Daly, and Matt Guokas to their first professional coaching contracts. Nineteen of his former players have become NBA head coaches.\nIn April 2019, after a career that has spanned more than 56 years, including 30-plus years with the Magic and 51 years in the NBA Pat Williams announced his retirement.\nMajor League Baseball expansion efforts.\nOn November 20, 2019, Williams held a press conference announcing the start of an effort to bring a major-league baseball team to Orlando, Florida. The suggested name for this franchise is the Orlando Dreamers. He cited the a strong built-in fan base and the rapidly growing city population as reasons why Orlando should be considered for an expansion team. Williams indicated he will continue to gauge Orlando's interest in a baseball team and then, based on those results, determine what the next steps should be.\nFamily.\nPat met his first wife, Jill, during his time in Chicago. They married in 1973 and divorced in 1996, being the parents of 18 children, 4 biological and 14 adopted from four nations between 1983 and 1993. His daughter Karyn is a Christian singer, and son Bobby a pro scout for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. In 1997, he married his current wife Ruth, a consultant with FranklinCovey Co., who brought to the house a child of her own.\nAwards.\nHe is a member of the Wake Forest Sports Hall of Fame after catching for the Deacon baseball team, including the 1962 Atlantic Coast Conference Championship team. He was inducted into the Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame in 2001. He won the DECA Entrepreneurial Spirit award at DECA's International Career Development Conference in 2011.\nOn February 24, 2012, Williams was announced as that year's winner of the John Bunn Award, presented annually by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame for significant lifetime contributions to the sport. He formally received the award on September 6, the day before the induction ceremony for the Hall's 2012 class."

        "title": "Albany Great Danes men's basketball",
        "text": "The Albany Great Danes men's basketball team is the basketball team that represent the University at Albany, State University of New York in Albany, New York. The school's team currently competes in the America East Conference and plays its home games at SEFCU Arena. The team played in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in 2006, 2007, 2013, 2014, and 2015. They also made the CIT in 2016 and 2017, and are currently coached by Dwayne Killings.\nTeam history.\nThe early years: \"Doc\" Sauers.\nRichard “Doc” Sauers served as Great Danes men's basketball coach from 1955 to 1997, with a short break in the 1987–88 season. He led the program to eleven NCAA College Division/Division III and four NAIA post-season tournament appearances in his tenure. Sauers finished his career with a 702–330 record in 41 seasons. Sauers achieved the 700-win mark on February 8, 1997, in an 89–71 victory over the University of Bridgeport. He would retire one month later and be inducted into the school's Hall of Fame in 2004. A banner is flown in the rafters of the SEFCU Arena honoring Sauers accomplishment of 702 wins.\nThe 2005–06 season: \"Why not us?\".\nThe process to become a Division I program was slow. From the 1999–2000 season, the first year in Division I, to the end of the 2004–05 season, UAlbany recorded a 48–118 record. The team finished with over 10 victories in only two seasons. However, in the 2005–06 campaign, the Great Danes compiled a 21–11 season. In that season, the Great Danes would take on both the Florida Gators and UCLA Bruins, who would play each other for the national championship. On March 11, 2006, the men's basketball team won the America East conference tournament, earning the school (and the SUNY system) its first ever berth to the NCAA tournament, defeating the University of Vermont 80–67 in a sold out RACC. The Great Danes were seeded #16 in the Washington, D.C., region and were matched up against top-seeded UConn. Despite the #16 seed being 0–87 before UAlbany took the floor, Head Coach Will Brown believed that his team had a chance to beat UConn in the tournament. With that, the team took the motto, \"Why Not Us?\".\nOn March 17, 2006, the Danes nearly became the first #16 seed to defeat a #1 seed in the Division I tournament. The Danes, down only 1 at the half, went on a 13–0 run early in the second half to take a double-digit lead over the Huskies. With the game televised on CBS, the Danes led 50–38 with just over 11 minutes left in the game. However, a 34–9 run by the Huskies' and stifling defense stopped the Danes' offense, the Huskies averted the upset, winning 72–59. The game against UConn gave the program instant notoriety.\nThe 2006–07 season: \"Lucky 13\".\nIn the 2006–07 season, the Great Danes faced a much stronger America East conference. The Great Danes would accomplish a 20–9 regular season, but be the #2 seed in the conference tournament. This forced the Great Danes to travel to Vermont, who was the #1 seed for the conference championship, and were previously 0–7. On March 10, 2007, the Danes' won their second consecutive America East title beating Vermont 60–59 in the conference final on a last second steal by Carl Ross and Brent Wilson.\nThe Great Danes would be seeded 13th in the South Division of the 2007 NCAA tournament. Creating a new motto \"Lucky 13\" which was worn on T-shirts sold on campus. On March 16, 2007, two busses carrying approximately 80 students would drive a total of 11 hours to see their Danes at the Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio, to see the #13 seed lose to the #4 seed Virginia Cavaliers 84–57 in the first round of the Tournament.\nPrior to the conclusion of the season, the program would retire the number 31 of player Jamar Wilson. Wilson finished his career as the school's all-time scorer with 2,164 points, plus ranked second in assists with 488. Wilson also became the first player in school history to score 500 points or more in three different seasons. He would also win two America East Player of the Year Awards, something only three other people in conference history had achieved. No athlete in the program's history has had their number retired prior.\nThe 2008–09 season: UAlbany hosts the tourney.\nWith only two of their remaining pieces from the \"Why Not Us?\" team still intact, Brian Connelly and Jimmie Covington, the Danes would look to rebuild with eight newcomers to the team. They would start the season 0–2 after matchups with Big East opponents Villanova and DePaul in \"homecoming\" games for their seniors. A 5–0 run after the slow start would put the Danes' in prime position to upset their crosstown rival Siena Saints, who had just endured 3 loses over 4 days at the 2008 Old Spice Classic in Orlando, Florida. However the Danes' would fall short by seven points. The Great Danes would win three of their next four games including a game postponed for snow and difficult travel conditions in Fairfield, Connecticut, against Sacred Heart before closing out the calendar year against the defending national champions Kansas Jayhawks. The purple-and-gold squad would fall behind early and not show any signs of life against the Jayhawks, in a 79–43 loss on nationally televised ESPNU.\nEntering conference play the Danes had an 8–5 record before falling to 8–6 and 0–1 in the conference with a loss to Hartford Hawks, after heading home the team would rebound with a last second win against conference favorite Boston U. Terriers 62–61 and also giving coach Will Brown his 100th career victory as head coach of the team. Following Brown's 100th win, the team would win for the third consecutive time in Burlington, Vermont, beating the heavily favored Catamounts by a score of 82–77, the team would then return home to beat I-88 rival Binghamton by a score of 72–66. However the team would struggle down the remainder of the conference schedule, winning only 3 of their final 12 conference games.\nWith the America East Conference tournament at SEFCU Arena for the first time in Albany's 9-year history as a member of the conference; the Great Danes would head into the tournament as the #7 seed with a 6–10 conference record, and face the #2 seeded Catamounts yet again. Prior to the 2009 season the #7 seed had gone 0–23 in games against the #2 overall seed, however Albany would prevail and upset the higher seeded Catamounts 56–52, but would lose to UMBC in the semi-finals. Other tournament games included the #8–9 matchup in which the Hartford Hawks would beat Maine on Friday, March 6 to advance to a matchup against top-seeded Binghamton. The Bearcats would then beat the Hawks, and other semi-final games included UMBC upsetting the 3rd seeded Boston U. Terriers, and the UNH Wildcats would beat Stony Brook in the #4–5 matchup. The other Sunday semi-final matchup had #1 Binghamton beat #4 New Hampshire. Binghamton hosted UMBC on Saturday March 14 on ESPN2 for the 2009 Championship.\nThe 2012–13 and 2013–14 seasons: The Year of the Upsets.\nIn 2012–13, the Great Danes would go 21–10 in the regular season. The season was highlighted by games against Top 10 ranked Ohio State and a 63–62 victory against the University of Washington in Seattle on November 13, 2012. Despite 21 wins, UAlbany had lost twice to regular season champions Stony Brook, regular season runner-up Vermont and third place Boston University, giving many fans limited faith in making a run for a conference title. However, the Great Danes would knock off Maine 50–49 and upset Stony Brook 61–59 in the 2013 Conference tournament, played at SEFCU Arena. On March 16, 2013, the Great Danes traveled to Vermont for a chance to win the AE Championship. Despite a 10–0 run by Vermont to start the game and being out-rebounded 34–20, the Great Danes pulled off the upset 53–49 to win the AE Championship and receive the conference automatic qualifier to the NCAA Tournament. It was the third straight victory for the Danes in the AE Championship game and the third time beating Vermont for the title. UAlbany became the first #4 seed to win the conference tournament.\nThe Three-Peat and \"The Shot\".\nThe 2013–14 season had many ups and downs for the Great Danes. The Great Danes played near .500 basketball for the entire season. They would finish 15–14 on the regular season, 9–7 in conference play, ranked #4 going into the conference tournament. With the tournament being hosted on their home court, UAlbany cruised to a first round win over UMBC. In the semifinals, the Great Danes pulled off the upset vs. #1 seed Vermont 67–58. The Great Danes were then forced to travel to Stony Brook for the Championship Game. On March 15, 2014, the Great Danes would defeat Stony Brook 69–60 to win their second straight AE Title and fourth title in nine years. On March 18, Albany won its first ever NCAA tournament victory, 71–64 over Mount St. Mary's in the First Four Round of the tournament. They would go on to lose to Florida in the 2nd Round\nDespite winning back-to-back championships, the Great Danes were selected fourth in preseason polls. The Great Danes opened the season 2–6, but finished the regular season 19–2 (15–1 in America East play). The Great Danes went into the America East tournament as the #1 seed. UAlbany defeated Maine and squeaked by New Hampshire. They played Stony Brook at SEFCU Arena in a rematch of the previous year's championship. Stony Brook was the only conference team to beat the Danes during the regular season.\nOn March 14, 2015, in front of a sold out SEFCU Arena, the Great Danes defeated Stony Brook 51–50 to win their third straight conference title. The Great Danes won the game on a three-point shot by Peter Hooley with 1.6 seconds to go. \"The Shot\" gained national attention because of Hooley. Hooley, a native of Australia, left the team for nearly an entire month to be with his mother, who had died from colon cancer. Hooley stated after the game, \"When you've got angels watching, you can do anything.\" Because of the game winning shot, Hooley and the Great Danes received national attention, as Hooley appeared on Sports Center and CBS' Road to March Madness Show. On March 20, 2015, The Great Danes fell to Oklahoma 69–60 in the second round of the 2015 NCAA basketball tournament.\nAdditional history.\nWhile not making the NCAA Tournament from the 2006–07 season to the 2012–13 season, the Great Danes did participate in a postseason tournaments. In 2011–12, UAlbany made the CIT Tournament, but lost to Manhattan in the first round. In 2016, they participated in the CBI Tournament, losing to Ohio in the first round in overtime.\nIn 2009, the University at Albany played host to its first America East Men's Basketball Championship at the 4,538-seat SEFCU Arena on campus. The America East brought the conference tournament back to SEFCU for the 2013 and 2014 Conference Championship.\nCoaches.\nCurrent coaching staff.\nSource:\nPostseason.\nNCAA Division I tournament results.\nThe Great Danes have appeared in the NCAA Division I tournament five times.

        "text": "Rugby union is a popular sport in the British Isles (Great Britain and Ireland), including England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. The game was arguably invented in 1823 by William Webb Ellis, and in 1871 the English Rugby Football Union was the first national rugby football union to be founded. It is organised separately in each of these countries, and also on an all-Ireland basis.\nRugby union in the British Isles is discussed in the following articles, corresponding to the separate organisations governing the sport:\nAnd also in the Crown Dependencies:\nAnd also in various British Overseas Territories:\nHowever areas where the sport is similar between the Home Nations will be discussed in this article.\nNational team.\nMen's.\nUnlike in rugby league, no combined British and Irish national rugby union team has ever competed in a major tournament such as the Rugby World Cup. Instead, the British &amp; Irish Lions go on tours to the traditional Southern Hemisphere nations of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, currently occurring on a four-year cycle; the first was an 1888 tour to New Zealand and Australia. The team also plays in select one-off matches as preparation for the tour test series.\nIn major competition the Home Nations represent themselves as:\nWomen's.\nThere is also a unified Great Britain women's national rugby union team; however, in most cases, women's rugby also sees the Home Nations represented individually by:\nDomestic competitions.\nThe Home Nations run individual competition across four league systems:\nStadiums.\nEach national team has their own national stadium:\nRugby Sevens.\nRugby Sevens is a version of Rugby Union played with seven players per side instead of the usual fifteen.

The Great Britain teams were formed only ten weeks prior to the games and saw the men's team reach the final achieving a runners up place, and the women's team achieved fourth."

        "title": "University of Michigan basketball scandal",
        "text": "The University of Michigan basketball scandal, or the Ed Martin scandal, concerned National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) rules violations resulting from the relationship between the University of Michigan (or Michigan), its men's basketball program, and booster Eddie L. \"Ed\" Martin. The violations principally involved payments booster Martin made to several players to launder money from an illegal gambling operation. It is one of the largest incidents involving payments to athletes in American collegiate history. An initial investigation by the school was joined by the NCAA, Big Ten Conference, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). As a result of this investigation, Michigan's basketball program was punished with sanctions.\nThe case began when the investigation of an automobile accident involving Michigan player Maurice Taylor revealed a curious relationship between Martin and Michigan's basketball program dating back to the 1980s. Several Michigan players were implicated over the next few years and by 1999 some were called before a federal grand jury. Four eventual professional basketball players—Taylor, Chris Webber, Robert Traylor and Louis Bullock—were discovered to have borrowed a total of $616,000 from Martin. During the investigation, Webber claimed not to have had any financial relationship with Martin, but eventually confessed to taking loans from Martin. He was both fined in the legal system and briefly suspended by the National Basketball Association (NBA) after performing public service.\nIn 1997, Michigan coach Steve Fisher was fired for his involvement in violations relating to the scandal. Subsequently, the NCAA investigation did not find him culpable of significant wrongdoing related to the scandal. By the fall of 2002, it was obvious that the four players were in fact guilty of taking money from Martin, and had thus compromised their amateur status. In response, Michigan placed the basketball program on two years' probation, withdrew from postseason consideration for the 2002–03 season, vacated all or part of five past seasons and removed the players' names and achievements from its record book. A few months later, the NCAA accepted these punishments, doubled both the probation period and the postseason ineligibility, penalized Michigan one scholarship for four seasons, and ordered the school to disassociate from the three living guilty players until 2012 (Webber's ban extended through 2013; the fourth player, Traylor, died in 2011).\nThe punishment cost the 2002–2003 team its postseason eligibility, cost past teams the 1997 National Invitation Tournament and the 1998 Big Ten tournament championships as well as appearances in the 1992 and 1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament Final Fours. It cost Webber his All-American 1993 honors, Traylor his MVP awards in the 1997 NIT and 1998 Big Ten tournament, as well as Bullock's standing as the school's third all-time leading scorer and all-time leader in free throws and the Big Ten's all-time leader in 3-point field goals (surpassed in 2011). The additional year of postseason ineligibility was overturned on appeal. Mandatory disassociations with the surviving players ended on May 8, 2013.\nBackground.\nIn the early morning of February 17, 1996, a Ford Explorer driven by Michigan basketball player Maurice Taylor went out of control while returning along M-14 from a party in Detroit, east of Michigan's campus in Ann Arbor. Among the passengers was high school star Mateen Cleaves, who was on his official recruiting visit. When an investigation revealed that the trip included a visit to the home of team booster Eddie L. \"Ed\" Martin, Michigan investigated his relationship with their men's basketball program.\nMartin was reportedly returning to Ann Arbor from Detroit with Taylor, Cleaves, Bullock, Ron Oliver, Robert Traylor, and Willie Mitchell after a party that included drugs, strippers and alcohol. Accounts of the party vary. By some accounts the party was hosted by Martin, but by other accounts Martin's house was a stop on the way to a party at Detroit's Westin Hotel. Martin, a retired electrician who worked at Ford Motor Company's River Rouge Complex, provided all the players with money. A 2003 profile in \"ESPN the Magazine\" detailed how Martin operated a numbers game in the Rouge factory:\nDuring the rollover accident, Traylor broke his arm and was lost for the season. Mitchell transferred from Michigan to the University of Alabama-Birmingham (UAB) after his junior season (1995–1996). Taylor, Traylor, Bullock, and Cleaves (who eventually signed with rival Michigan State) all went on to be drafted by National Basketball Association (NBA) teams. Bullock played in various foreign leagues but never in the NBA.\nThe NCAA uses a statute of limitations of four years. Thus, at any time the NCAA can open or re-open an investigation for an infraction occurring within the last four years. However, NCAA convention is to date violations based on when they learned about the infraction. Thus, events that had occurred far more than four years prior to the investigation came under its purview. The initial accident reports revealed several inconsistencies and violations that induced expanded investigation.\nMichigan admitted to the secondary NCAA violation of transporting a recruit more than from campus. Questions were immediately raised about whether Taylor actually owned the vehicle involved in the crash. The NCAA asked for leasing documentation of Taylor's vehicle, and Michigan investigated the registrations of its players' vehicles. The university soon required that all the vehicles driven by its players be part of a special vehicle registration program.\nMartin's relationship with the program.\nIn March 1997, Michigan and the Big Ten released the results of an investigation into Martin's relationship with the school. The investigation determined that Martin had nurtured a relationship that involved some minor violations. The violations that were published were that Martin was present at a recruit's home during a visit by head coach Fisher; and that he'd given a Michigan player a birthday cake. Fisher prevented Martin from committing serious additional violations by keeping him from placing a deposit on an apartment for a player. He also stopped Martin from buying airplane tickets for another player's family. A second October 1997 private investigation also failed to reveal any large violations.\n1980s.\nMartin befriended Perry Watson, coach for Southwestern High School of Detroit, and provided gifts to the team's players. When Michigan's Bill Frieder recruited a Southwestern High School prospect, Martin was present. Martin then began attending Michigan games with the prospect's father when the student enrolled. He also attended games and practices with Watson. Martin also developed a relationship with Iowa basketball coach George Raveling, who regularly recruited from Detroit high schools for Iowa. He also received complimentary tickets to Iowa games while Raveling was coach. Martin attempted to give gifts and cash to Frieder recruit Terry Mills. After Frieder left Michigan in 1989, Martin immediately formed an equally close relationship with his successor, Fisher, and gave Fisher's family gifts.\nWebber.\nMartin noticed Webber during a middle school game. Martin attended Webber's church, where Webber's father was deacon and began fostering a relationship by making frequent visits to the Webber family home. Between 1988 and 1993 Martin gave Webber about $280,000. Eventually, Webber would confess to having received and repaid only $38,200, an amount identified via a specific transaction tied to Webber.\n1990s.\nIn September 1996, athletic director Joe Roberson learned that during the previous month Martin had tried to place deposits on apartments for Traylor and Louis Bullock. Martin had also offered airline tickets to Bullock's parents so they could attend a tournament in Puerto Rico. It emerged that Fisher had known about Martin's actions at the time. While Fisher had ordered the deposits retrieved and made sure the tickets weren't used, he didn't tell anyone in the athletic or compliance offices, as he was required to do. As a result of Roberson's findings, he ordered interviews of the basketball team and team coaches.\nThe March 1997 Big Ten report showed that official University phone records documented that the coaching staff called Martin's home 39 times. Between the 1991–92 and the 1993–94 seasons, records showed that Martin received 97 tickets to Michigan basketball games either for free or under his special arrangement to have tickets made available for purchase. Watson joined the Michigan basketball coaching staff in 1991. The October 1997 investigation revealed that Fisher had provided Martin with passes for sixteen complimentary tickets from 1994 to 1997, and that his secretary and other clerical workers made out ten more such passes. In addition, six passes were signed with the PW initials of departed coach Watson. Watson denied making such passes available and a handwriting analysis matched five of the six to Fisher. Fisher was fired when the investigation became public on October 10, 1997, just a week before the start of basketball practices.\nIn June 1997, the \"Detroit Free Press\" revealed sources that claimed both Chris Webber and Taylor had received at least $100,000 from Martin, but that Webber had repaid the money after turning pro. A pattern of Martin befriending young basketball stars eventually became clear. Martin paid $280,000 to Webber from 1988 (when he was a ninth-grader at Detroit Country Day School) to 1993 (his sophomore year at Michigan, after which he turned pro). Martin also befriended Traylor as a freshman in high school. Martin was at Traylor's home when Fisher made a recruiting visit. Between 1994 (his senior year at Murray–Wright High School in Detroit) and 1998 (his junior year at Michigan, after which he turned pro), Martin gave Traylor about $160,000. Martin befriended Taylor when he was in high school. Between 1995 and 1998 (during his time at Michigan), Martin gave Taylor about $105,000. Since Bullock went to high school in Maryland, he did not know Martin before coming to Michigan. Martin gave Bullock about $71,000 during his four years at Michigan which ended in 1999.\nRoberson also learned that during the 1992 Final Four, Fisher made two of the limited supply of team rooms available to Martin. Martin gave one hotel room paid for by Michigan to Webber's father—a violation of NCAA rules. For his part, Martin denied any wrongdoing when questioned by an NCAA enforcement representative. However, he later refused to cooperate with the University or the NCAA, forcing Michigan to ban him from any contact with the athletic program in March 1997.\nRaid and subpoenas.\nAfter the Michigan/Big Ten investigation and the private investigation, no serious violations arose. For example, Robert Traylor, Chris Webber, Jalen Rose, and Maurice Taylor were cleared in October 1997. In April 1999, the FBI and IRS raided several Detroit-area homes to stop a numbers game operation in the area's Ford plants. Martin's home was one of the targets; on April 28, he was found with a loaded gun, gambling records and $20,000 in cash in his home. The authorities were investigating Martin's alleged numbers game operation at Ford plants and whether Martin had provided Michigan basketball players with money and gifts. Another item that they seized was a Western Union MoneyGram from Martin to Traylor. In the course of a federal investigation, evidence turned up that Martin had given cash payments and other benefits to several Michigan players and Detroit-area high school prospects starting in the early 1980s. As a result of the investigations, in May 1999 a federal grand jury subpoenaed several Michigan basketball players to investigate the relationship between Martin and the basketball program.\nFormer Michigan basketball player Albert White was implicated in early investigations for having accepted US$37,000, but he was not named in later indictments. It was not clear how much of the money White received directly and how much was given to his friends and family to influence his decision to attend Michigan. Although White was one of several players captured on federal wiretaps and interviewed by both the FBI and IRS, he cooperated fully. Although he was not implicated, he transferred from Michigan to play for the Missouri Tigers men's basketball team after clashing with Steve Fisher.\nFederal indictments.\nEd Martin.\nIn late 1999, Martin originally agreed to a plea bargain in which he agreed to disclose information about the payments. The agreement with the United States Attorney's office, whose Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Convertino led the prosecution case against Martin, was nearly finalized in January 2000. The paperwork for the plea agreement was to be finalized in March 2000 for the former Ford Motor Company employee to plead guilty to one count of federal gambling and one count of income tax evasion. He and his son, Carlton, backed out in May 2000, preferring to take their chances at trial due to the likelihood of light punishment for first-time offenders. Under the plea agreement in which they would have forfeited $100,000 and faced 6–15 months in prison, they would have been able to keep their homes. If found guilty at trial, they could have received up to 5 years imprisonment and a fine of $250,000 per count, but they would not have to agree to cooperate with the University investigation.\nLess than a week after Martin backed out of his plea agreement, several former players were subpoenaed to testify before grand juries. In August 2000, Traylor and Bullock, by this time professional basketball players in the NBA and Italy respectively, were confirmed to have taken payments from Martin. Many of the payments came after the 1997 banning of Martin from contact with the team and the firing of Steve Fisher. The two players cooperated with federal authorities and admitted to receiving money. Traylor, Bullock, Webber, Rose and Taylor all testified before the grand jury. Fisher, a former San Diego State University coach, testified before a federal grand jury investigating Martin. Also testifying were former Michigan assistants Perry Watson, Brian Dutcher and Scott Perry. Martin and Watson had been close friends when Watson was head coach at Detroit Southwestern High School, with Martin often sitting on the bench along with assistant coaches. Perry, who had arranged Cleaves' recruiting trip, had known Martin since 1977 and coached under Fisher from 1993–1997. Many players and observers believed Martin was Watson's uncle, leading to Martin's schoolyard nickname of \"Uncle Ed.\" Martin and Watson had a falling-out in the early 1990s, shortly after Watson joined the Michigan staff. Webber's father also gave sealed testimony before the grand jury.\nOn March 21, 2002—after almost three years of testimony—the grand jury returned an eight-count indictment charging Martin, his wife Hilda and their friend Clarence Malvo with running an illegal gambling business at the Ford River Rouge plant, money laundering and conspiracy to launder money. According to the indictment, Martin made illicit loans totalling $616,000 to Webber, Taylor, Bullock and Traylor to launder money from an illegal numbers game at Detroit–area auto plants. The loans were made with the understanding that they would be repaid once the players turned pro. Martin was indicted for having paid Webber a total of $280,000 between 1988–1993, which included time from Webber's freshman year at Detroit Country Day School in Birmingham, Michigan to his sophomore year at Michigan.\nMartin, his wife, Hilda, and Clarence Malvo were under federal indictment for conspiracy to engage in illegal gambling and could have faced up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted. Mr. Martin had also been charged with seven additional counts: having an illegal gambling business, conspiracy to launder money, three counts of laundering money and two counts of using money from illegal activities. The charge against Hilda Martin was dropped as part of a plea agreement. On April 8, 2002, Malvo pleaded guilty to grand jury perjury for testifying that he did not work for Martin. On May 28, 2002 Martin pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to launder money. He agreed to cooperate with investigations by the government, Michigan and the NCAA. The other seven charges against Martin were dropped in addition to those against Hilda. Furthermore, Martin was barred from associating with the team by a ban, which made any continuing financial relationship with him in violation of NCAA rules and to be considered a new violation.\nChris Webber.\nIn September 2002, Webber was indicted on five charges, including obstruction of justice and lying to a federal grand jury, for having misrepresented his relationship with Martin. Each charge was punishable by five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He vowed to fight the charges.\nMartin pleaded guilty to running an illegal lottery at the Ford Motors plant he worked at to provide proceeds for the players. Martin testified that he paid Webber $280,000 in cash and gifts, but as of January 2003 Webber denied receipt of money from Martin and maintained that he had testified truthfully to a grand jury in 2000 on such matters. Martin stated that there was always an understanding that the money would be repaid after the players became professionals. In the 2000 grand jury investigation, Webber had been asked about whether his off-campus apartment rent had been paid by Martin and whether he had received spending money, jewelry, clothing or a stereo. Webber generally responded by saying either that he could not recall or that he did not think he had received such gifts. However, prosecutors say that Webber, after turning professional, gave Martin \"a significant sum of money, in cash, as a partial repayment.\" In December 2002, Webber's father admitted he had accepted gifts and a small loan from Martin, which contradicted earlier statements. Prosecutors also accused Webber's aunt of lying about a meeting she had with Martin in the updated filing.\nChris Webber, his father, Mayce Webber, and aunt, Charlene Johnson, were also indicted on charges of having lied to a federal grand jury regarding dealings with Martin. The University had attempted three previous investigations and was not successful at gathering enough evidence to proceed further until the federal government got involved. In January 2003, the federal prosecutors filed more detailed indictments against Webber and his relatives for obstruction of justice and perjury.\nEd Martin died of a suspected pulmonary embolism on February 14, 2003, at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. He was awaiting sentencing at the time of his death. Malvo, who confessed to taking bets and paying off winning wagers for Martin, pleaded guilty April 8, 2002 to lying before a federal grand jury. He admitted to telling a grand jury in October 1999 that he bet money but did not work for Martin. He was sentenced in August 2002 to two years' probation.\nMartin's death largely took the air out of the federal perjury case against Webber. In July 2003, on the day before jury selection in the case was due to begin, Webber pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of criminal contempt in order to avoid a possible jail sentence. He admitted to having received and repaid $38,200. The deal was subject to a discretionary fine and possible classification of the infraction as a felony by the United States District Court Judge Nancy Edmunds who would rule in September 2003. In exchange for the plea all other charges were dropped against him as were all charges against his father. The charges against Webber's aunt had been dropped after Martin's death.\nSanctions.\nSelf-imposed.\nBy the fall of 2002, it had become clear that Michigan's basketball program was guilty of major violations. In response, Michigan decided to impose its own sanctions on the program. Initially, Michigan announced it would forfeit every game in which the four players appeared. On November 7, 2002; Michigan president Mary Sue Coleman and athletic director Bill Martin announced that the school was imposing sanctions of its own on the basketball program. Among them:\nColeman described what happened as \"wrong, plain and simple.\" She also said, \"I am determined that nothing like this will ever happen again at Michigan.\"\nAt 8:00 A.M. that same day, the four banners were removed from the rafters. Four days later, the athletic department officially deleted all mention of Webber, Taylor, Traylor and Bullock from the school's athletic records. These included Traylor's MVP awards in the 1997 NIT and 1998 Big Ten tournament, as well as Bullock's standing as the Big Ten's all-time leader in 3-point field goals and the school's third all-time leading scorer and all-time leader free throws made. The deletions came because the payments may have compromised their amateur status. Several players not implicated in the scandal continue to be listed among the school's honorees such as Rob Pelinka (Walter Byers Scholarship, 1993), Juwan Howard and Jalen Rose (All-American, 1994) and Jerod Ward (Big Ten All-Tournament Team, 1998).\nMichigan finished the 2002–2003 season with a 17–13 record but sat out both that year's NCAA and NIT tournaments due to the self-imposed postseason ban.\nNCAA.\nOn May 8, 2003, the NCAA accepted Michigan's sanctions. It also imposed an additional two years of probation and docked the school one scholarship a year from 2004–2005 until 2007–2008. It also ordered the school to disassociate itself from Traylor (who died in 2011), Taylor and Bullock until 2012, and Webber until 2013. The NCAA also barred Michigan from postseason play for the 2003–04 season (later overturned on appeal). Infractions committee chairman Thomas Yeager, who had come very close to imposing the \"death penalty\" on the University of Alabama football program a few months earlier, called the Martin/Michigan affair \"one of the three or four most egregious violations of NCAA bylaws\" ever. The disassociation meant that Michigan could not accept donations or recruiting assistance from any of the players for ten years. Webber's sanction ended on May 8, 2013. The NCAA criticized Fisher for allowing Martin access to the program, but did not sanction him. The University announced its intention to appeal the additional one-year suspension from post-season play. As a result of the sanctions, Ellerbe's successor, Tommy Amaker, received a two-year contract extension through the 2007–08 season to compensate for the duties while under probation, and Bernard Robinson had the right to transfer without sitting out a year because, as the only scholarship senior, the ineligibility extended for his entire remaining scholarship tenure.\nVacated and forfeited games.\nThe following is the official NCAA record of affected games:\nFallout.\nIn September 2003, the NCAA reversed its decision to add a second year of postseason ineligibility after hearing an appeal by the University; the Wolverines went on to become champions of the 2004 National Invitation Tournament. Also in September 2003, Judge Edmunds deferred sentencing until she could monitor Webber's service of 300 hours of community service at a middle-school literacy program for two summers that she ordered. Also in September the University announced it sought $695,000 in restitution from Webber. Webber was the only involved athlete that the University sought restitution from in part because he was the only one who confessed to lying to a grand jury. Webber stated that he did not feel the University's request was appropriate because he had not stolen from the University.\nDuring the 2003-04 NBA season, Webber was on the disabled list until February. When he returned, the NBA suspended him for three games for his guilty plea. In September 2005, Judge Edmunds ruled that the conviction should be treated as a misdemeanor and that Webber should pay the maximum fine for such an offense, which was $100,000. This ruling came after Webber served 330 hours of public service and accumulated $78,000 of related out-of-pocket expenses.\nThe Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA), following the release of court testimony, requested that Webber's high school, Detroit Country Day (DCD), forfeit the three state titles won with Webber in the lineup (1989–91). DCD conducted its own investigation, then called a press conference on March 1, 2004, to announce there was no \"credible evidence\" Webber's amateur status had been violated. When the MHSAA gave them the option of forfeiting games Webber played they decided not to. Traylor's alma mater, Murray–Wright High School, forfeited its entire 1994–95 season—Traylor's senior year.\nExpiration of disassociation.\nThe disassociations with Chris Webber, Maurice Taylor and Louis Bullock ended on May 8, 2013. (Robert Traylor, as noted above, died before his disassociation could end.) Former Michigan athletic director Dave Brandon had stated that he would have welcomed the opportunity to reassociate with the players: \"I've never met any of those guys, and I am looking forward to meeting them...If any of those guys are interested in meeting with me, that would be great.\" Both Bullock and Taylor immediately stated that they look forward to their re-affiliation with the university. At the stroke of midnight when the disassociation ended, Webber tweeted \"OK!!!\"\nThere were many vocal opinions on what should happen following the end of the disassociation. An article on Bleacher Report stated that the University should retire Webber's Jersey. When asked whether the National finalist banners would ever be rehung, University President Mary Sue Coleman said not during her tenure, but she noted that \"Some day, I won't be president anymore, and maybe someone else will have a different view\".\nWebber made his first post-ban public appearance at the University of Michigan on November 3, 2018, when he was invited by football coach Jim Harbaugh to participate as an honorary captain for its game against Penn State; Webber was warmly received at Michigan Stadium. Of the experience, Webber said on NBA TV, \"Tell you what, fellas, this was a great moment, in front of 100,000 people. I had goosebumps and chills, and definitely some watery eyes.\" Webber also spent time with the football program as its guest before the game. He did not meet with the Michigan basketball team or staff, but despite this, head coach John Beilein stated that \"I think it was a great step in the right direction that he was here.\""

        "title": "1980 CART PPG Indy Car World Series",
        "text": "The 1980 CART PPG Indy Car World Series season was the second in the CART era of U.S. open-wheel racing. It consisted of twelve races, beginning in Ontario, California on April 13 and concluding in Avondale, Arizona on November 8. The PPG Indy Car World Series Drivers' Champion and Indianapolis 500 winner was Johnny Rutherford. Rookie of the Year was Dennis Firestone. The entire season, including the 64th Indianapolis 500, was to be co-sanctioned by both the USAC and CART under the banner of the Championship Racing League (CRL). However, USAC withdrew from the arrangement after five races.\nThe season-opening race at Phoenix, set for March 2, was cancelled due to local flooding and washed out roads.\nJohnny Rutherford in Jim Hall's Chaparral 2K ground effects chassis dominated the season. Rutherford won five races, including a dominating performance at the 1980 Indianapolis 500. Rutherford finished in the top five in the first ten races, pulling out to a commanding and unmatchable points lead. Rutherford started the season out by finishing 1st or 2nd in the first six races, and ended with a total of eight finished of 1st or 2nd. Rutherford's season was not without incident, however. In the final race of the season at Phoenix, while battling Tom Sneva for the lead, Rutherford tangled with a lapped car, hit the wall, then flipped over. The car landed upside-down hard on its rollbar, but Rutherford was not seriously injured.\nDrivers and constructors.\nThe following teams and drivers competed for the 1980 CART World Series.\nSeason Summary.\nSchedule.\n- The Phoenix race was scheduled for March 2, but cancelled due to flooding.&lt;br&gt;\n Oval/Speedway Dedicated road course\nRace summaries.\nRace 1: Datsun Twin 200\nFor the opening race of the year, Johnny Rutherford qualified on the pole, with Bobby Unser, Al Unser, Rick Mears, and Tom Sneva making up the rest of the top five starters.\nJohnny Rutherford led the first eight laps, before Bobby Unser caught and passed in lap traffic. However, while leading on lap 14, he suffered a cracked radiator and dropped out. This moved Rutherford back in front, and he was mostly uncontested for the remainder of the race as most challengers had problems. Rick Mears dropped out due to electrical issues while running second. Pancho Carter moved up to second, but he dropped out with fuel pump problems, followed by Al Unser dropping out on lap 45 with a broken transmission. With most of his competition out, Rutherford cruised to an easy victory over Tom Sneva. Gordon Johncock finished third, Spike Gehlhausen fourth, and Tom Bagley fifth.\nRace 2: Indianapolis 500\nRace 3: Rex Mays Classic\nGordon Johncock qualified on the pole, with Johnny Rutherford starting second, Al Unser starting third, Rick Mears starting fourth, and Bobby Unser rounding out the top five starters.\nIn the race Rutherford jumped out to the lead on lap 7, and controlled most of the next 50 laps before Gordon Johncock took the lead on lap 55. 60 laps later, under the fourth caution of the day, Al Unser, who was running in second had an engine failure and dropped out. This moved his brother Bobby Unser into second, and on the restart he managed to catch and pass Johncock for the lead, holding on to win. Johnny Rutherford rose to second, Gordon Johncock ended up third, Pancho Carter finished fourth, and Rick Mears fifth.\nWith his second place, Rutherford now had a 400 point lead over second place Tom Sneva, with Gordon Johncock 550 points back in third, Gary Bettenhausen 925 points back in fourth, and Rick Mears 984 points behind in fifth.\nRace 4: True Value 500\nBobby Unser won the pole, with A.J. Foyt starting second, Mario Andretti starting third, Mike Mosley starting in fourth, and Johnny Rutherford starting fifth.\nIn the race, A.J. Foyt took the lead on the first lap, and led most of the first half of the race, giving up the lead only for pit shuffling. The first caution came on lap 11, when Al Loquasto lost a wheel and Dennis Firestone wrecked in the same part of the track. The second caution came on lap 26, after Howdy Holmes lost control, Jim McElreath slowed and Roger Rager hit the rear of his car.\nWhile leading on lap 82, Foyt encountered a bad valve, and dropped out. This gave the lead to Bobby Unser, who led most of the rest of the race. Johnny Rutherford led 1 lap due to pit stop shuffling, followed by 5 laps under caution after Pancho Carter spun, but when the green flag flew after a caution on lap 165, Unser pulled away. Rutherford's hopes of winning ended with 20 laps to go when his engine stalled in the pits, allowing Unser to win the race by a wide margin over Rutherford. Tom Sneva finished third, Bill Alsup fourth, and Vern Schuppan fifth. Most other stars were taken out due to attrition. Al Unser was never a factor and dropped out with handling problems on lap 35. Mike Mosley broke a piston while running in third on lap 46, Danny Ongais dropped out with clutch problems on lap 100, Mario Andretti was sidelined with a broken transmission on lap 105, and Rick Mears blew his engine on lap 163.\nJohnny Rutherford extended his lead to 500 points over Tom Sneva, with Bobby Unser rising to third, 1114 points behind, Gordon Johncock, who didn't enter, falling to fourth, 1350 points back, and Pancho Carter rising to fifth, 1452 points behind.\nRace 5: Red Roof Inns 250\nAl Unser qualified on the pole, followed by brother Bobby Unser in second, Rick Mears in third, Johnny Rutherford in fourth, and Danny Ongais rounding out the top five starters.\nThe start of the race was problematic. Starter Duane Sweeney didn't give the green flag when the pace car pulled off as the back rows were strung out, but the field got going anyway, with Al Unser spinning off track in the first turn. Two laps later they got back in two-by-two order for the official start. Danny Ongais and Sheldon Kinser didn't make it to the green flag, with Ongais having ignition problems and Kinser a blown engine. On the first lap, Tim Richmond spun off course and was hit by John Wood.\nBobby Unser jumped out to the lead after his brother spun, and led the first 12 laps, But he encountered a valve problem while leading and dropped out. Rick Mears then took the lead, and throughout the next 20 laps dueled with Johnny Rutherford. After a poor pit stop by Rutherford, Mears had a 20 second lead, but due to heat exhaustion lost concentration and spun out while leading on lap 47. This gave the lead to Rutherford, with Mears's day ending on lap 54 after Rick Muther spun out and Mears hit him. This brought out the caution, allowing second place Gordon Johncock to close. But when the green flew, Rutherford pulled away and won, a rare road course win. Bill Alsup finished third, Roger Mears fourth, and Vern Schuppan fifth. Polesitter Al Unser lost a lap due to an unscheduled pit stop, and dropped out with suspension problems while running fifth.\nRutherford now had a 770 point lead over Tom Sneva, who had crashed out. Bobby Unser was third, 1406 points back, Gordon Johncock fourth, 1410 points back, and Pancho Carter fifth, 1662 points back."

        "title": "Stanley Cup playoffs",
        "text": "The Stanley Cup playoffs () is the annual National Hockey League (NHL) elimination tournament to determine the league champion. The winner of the Stanley Cup is by default the NHL champion as well. Eight teams from each of the two conferences qualify for the playoffs based on regular season points totals. The final round is commonly known as the Stanley Cup Finals, which matches the two conference champions.\nThe NHL is the only major professional sports league in North America to refer to its playoffs by the name of its championship trophy, a tradition which has arisen because the Stanley Cup is North America's oldest professional sports trophy, dating back more than two decades before the establishment of the NHL. Originally inscribed the \"Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup\", the trophy was donated in 1892 by Lord Stanley of Preston, then–Governor General of Canada, initially as a \"challenge trophy\" for Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club. From 1893 when the first Cup was awarded to 1914, the champions held onto the Cup until they either lost their league title to another club, or a champion from another league issued a formal challenge and defeated the reigning Cup champion in a final game to claim their win.\nProfessional teams then first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906. Starting in 1915, the Cup was officially contested between the champion of the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the champion of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). After a series of league mergers and folds, including the 1917 establishment of the NHL as a successor to the NHA, the Stanley Cup became the championship trophy of the NHL prior to the 1926–27 season.\nThe NHL has always used a playoff tournament to determine its champion. The league's playoff system has changed over the years, from the NHL's inception in 1917, to when the NHL took over the Cup in 1926, to the current setup today.\nCurrent format.\nFormat.\nThe Stanley Cup playoffs consists of four rounds of best-of-seven series. Each series is played in a 2–2–1–1–1 format, meaning the team with home-ice advantage hosts games one, two, five, and seven, while their opponent hosts games three, four, and six. Games five, six, and seven are only played if needed.\nEight teams in each conference qualify for the playoffs. In the playoff series format instituted in 2014, the first, second, and third place teams in each of the four divisions qualify for the playoffs automatically. Two additional teams from each conference, regardless of divisional alignment, also qualify for the playoffs by having the highest point totals out of the remaining teams in the conference. These teams are referred to as the wild cards. Since there is no attention paid to divisional alignment with the wild cards, it is possible for one division in a conference to have five teams in the postseason while the other has just three.\nIn the First Round, the teams are split into two separate brackets by conference. Each bracket consists of the top three divisional qualifiers and one of the wild cards. The lower seeded wild card plays against the division winner with the best record while the other wild card plays against the other division winner, and both wild cards are de facto 4 seeds. The other two series match the second and third place teams from the divisions.\nThe winners of both First Round series advance to the Second Round. The reseeding in the previous format, which ensured the top seed would play the lowest remaining seed, was discarded. The winners of these series advance to the conference finals and the two conference finals winners move on to the Stanley Cup Finals.\nIn the first two rounds, the higher-seeded team has home-ice advantage (regardless of point record). Thereafter, it goes to the team with the better regular season record (regardless of seeding); in the case of a tie, the league's standard tie-breaking procedure is applied. The team with home-ice advantage hosts games one, two, five, and seven, while the opponent hosts games three, four, and six (games five through seven are played if necessary).\nAny ties in the standings at the end of the regular season are broken using the following protocols:\nOvertime rules.\nUnlike the regular season where a contest could eventually be decided in a shootout, overtime in the playoffs is played in multiple sudden-death, 20-minute five-on-five periods until one team scores. Although a playoff game could theoretically last indefinitely, only two contests have reached six overtime periods, and neither of those went beyond six. During playoff overtime periods, the only break is to shovel away the loose ice shavings at the first stoppage after the period is halfway finished.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe Stanley Cup was commissioned in 1892 as the \"Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup\" and was named after Lord Stanley of Preston, the Governor General of Canada who donated it as an award to Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club. The entire Stanley family supported the sport, the sons and daughters all playing and promoting the game. The first Cup was then awarded in 1893 to Montreal Hockey Club.\nDuring the period from 1893 to 1914, the champions held the Cup until they lost their league title to another club, or a champion from another league issued a formal challenge and subsequently defeated them in a special game or series. The competitive format of each Cup challenge was determined by negotiation between the two clubs. Furthermore, none of the leagues that played for the Cup had a formal playoff system to decide their respective champions; whichever team finished in first place after the regular season won the league title. A playoff would only be played if teams tied for first-place in their leagues at the end of the regular season.\nAs the prestige of winning the Cup grew, so did the need to attract top players, and thus professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906. Then in 1908, the Allan Cup was introduced as the trophy for Canada's amateurs, and the Stanley Cup became a symbol of professional hockey supremacy. In 1910, the National Hockey Association (NHA) held its inaugural season and soon emerged as the best professional hockey league in Canada, keeping the Cup for the next four years. In 1914, the Victoria Aristocrats of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) challenged the NHA and Cup champion Toronto Blueshirts. One year later, the NHA and the PCHA began an agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup, effectively ending the Cup challenge games.\nAfter years of the NHA not having an annual playoff tournament to determine its league champion, the 1916–17 NHA season saw the league split its schedule into two halves with the top team from each half moving on to the league finals, which was a two-game total goals series. The PCHA continued to award their league title to the team that finished in first place after the regular season.\nEmergence of the NHL.\nThe National Hockey League (NHL) was founded in November 1917 as a successor to the NHA. From the NHL's inception until 1920, both NHL and PCHA teams were eligible for the Stanley Cup. The NHL inherited the NHA's regular season system of dividing it into two halves, with the top team from each half moving on to the league finals. The NHL finals was a two-game total goals series in 1918 and a best-of-seven series in 1919. In 1920, the Ottawa Senators were automatically declared the league champion when the team had won both halves of the regular season. The two halves format was abandoned the next year, and the top two teams faced off for the NHL championship in a two-game total goals series.\nAt the time, the NHL champion would later face the winners of the PCHA and, from 1921, the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) in further rounds in order to determine the Stanley Cup champion. During this time, as the rules of the NHL and those of the western leagues differ (the main difference being that NHL rules allowed five skaters while the western leagues allowed six), the rules for each game in the Stanley Cup Finals alternated between those of the NHL and the western leagues. Before the WCHL competed for the Stanley Cup, the Cup championship series was a best-of-five series. Following the involvement of the WCHL, one league champion was given a bye straight to the finals (a best-of-three affair starting in 1922), while the other two competed in a best-of-three semifinal. As travel expenses were high during these times, it was often the case that the NHL champions were sent west to compete. In a dispute between the leagues in 1923 about whether to send one or both western league champions east, the winner of the PCHA/WCHL series would proceed to the Stanley Cup Finals, while the loser of the series would face the NHL champion, both series being best-of-three.\nIn 1924, the NHL playoffs expanded from two to three teams (with the top team getting a bye to the two-game total goal NHL finals), but because the first-place Hamilton Tigers refused to play under this format, the second and third place teams played for the NHL championship in a two-game total goals affair. The Stanley Cup Finals series returned to a best-of-five format the same year.\nNHL takes control of Stanley Cup.\nWith the merger of the PCHA and WCHL in 1925 and the merged league's collapse in 1926, the NHL took de facto control of the Stanley Cup. While the Cup would not be formally deeded to the league until 1947, from 1926 onward the NHL playoffs and the Stanley Cup playoffs are considered synonymous. The NHL was subsequently divided into the Canadian and American divisions for the 1927–28 season. For 1927, six teams qualified for the playoffs, three from each division, with the division semifinals and finals being a two-game total goals affair, and the Stanley Cup Finals becoming a best-of-five series. In 1928, the playoff format was changed so that the two teams with identical division ranking would face each other (i.e., the division winners played each other, the second place teams play each other, and likewise for the third place teams). The first place series was a best-of-five affair, with the winner proceeding to the best-of-three Stanley Cup Finals, while the others were a two-game total goals series. The winner of the second and third place series played each other in a best-of-three series, with the winner earning the other berth to the Stanley Cup Finals. This format had a slight modification the following year, where the semifinal series became a two-game total goals affair and the Stanley Cup Finals became a best-of-five series. The two-game total goals format was abolished in 1937, with those series being changed to best-of-three affairs.\nOriginal Six era (1942–1967).\nThe 1930s saw the reduction of teams from ten to seven, which resulted in an end to the Canadian and American divisions. The Stanley Cup playoffs saw the first- and second-place teams play against each other in a best-of-seven series for one berth in the Stanley Cup Finals, while the third- to sixth-place teams battled in a series of best-of-three matches for the other berth (with the third-place team taking on the fourth-place team, and the fifth-place team against the sixth-place team). In 1939, the Stanley Cup Finals became a best-of-seven series, the format still used today.\nThe 1942–43 season saw the removal of the New York Americans, leaving six remaining teams (now known as the \"Original Six\"). From 1943 to 1967, all playoff match ups were best-of-seven affairs. The first and third-place teams played in one semifinal, while the second and fourth-place teams played in the other semifinal, with the semifinal winners advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals. During this time, Detroit Red Wings fans often threw an octopus onto the ice as a good luck charm, as eight wins were required to win the Stanley Cup.\nExpansion era (1967–1993).\nThe 1967 expansion saw the number of teams double from six to twelve for the 1967–68 season, and with it the creation of the Western and Eastern divisions. The playoff format remained largely the same, with four teams in each division qualifying for the playoffs, all series remaining best-of-seven, and the division champions battling for the Stanley Cup. The 1970–71 season, because of fan demand, brought forth the first inter-conference playoff match up outside of the Stanley Cup Finals since the pre-war expansion, which had the winner of the second-place versus fourth-place match up in one conference take on the winner of the first- versus third-place match up in the other conference for a berth in the Stanley Cup Finals. The following year had one minor change to its playoff format: a stronger team would face a weaker opponent. Thus, instead of a first-place versus third-place and a second versus fourth-place match up in the first round, the first round had the first-place versus the fourth and the second versus the third-place. This practice of having stronger teams facing weaker opposition has continued to the present day. This change necessitated the need to reseed the winners of the quarterfinals by matching up the highest remaining seed of one division against the lowest remaining seed from the other division in the semifinals.\nThe 1974–75 season saw another change to the playoff system to accommodate a league that had expanded to 18 teams in two conferences and four divisions. Under this system, twelve teams qualified for the playoffs. The top team from each division would earn a bye to the quarterfinal, while the second- and third-place teams from each division started their playoff run from a best-of-three preliminary round. In each round of the playoffs, the teams remaining were seeded regardless of divisional or conference alignment, with the preliminary-round series being a best-of-three affair while the remainder of the series remained best-of-seven. The 1977–78 season had one minor change in its playoff format: although the second-place finishers from each division would qualify for the preliminary round, the four playoff spots reserved for the third-place teams were replaced by four \"wild-card\" spots—spots for the four teams with the highest regular season point total that did not finish first or second in their divisions.\nWith the absorption of four teams from the World Hockey Association in the 1979–80 season, a new playoff system was introduced where 16 of the league's 21 teams qualified for postseason play. The four division winners qualified for the playoffs while twelve wild-card positions rounded out the sixteen teams. At the beginning of each round the teams were seeded based on their regular season point totals, with the preliminary round being a best-of-five series while all other playoff series were best-of-seven.\nThe 1981–82 season brought forth the return of divisional matchups, with the top four teams from each division qualifying for the playoffs. Division champions would be determined, followed by the conference champions, who would meet in the Stanley Cup Finals. The Division Semifinals was a best-of-five affair until the 1986–87 season, when it became a best-of-seven series, while all other series remained best-of seven.\nModern era (1993–present).\nFor the 1993–94 season, the league revamped its playoff structure to become conference-based rather than division-based. Eight teams in each conference qualified for the playoffs. The first-place teams in each division were seeded first and second in their respective conference playoffs; the next six best teams in each conference also qualified and were seeded third through eighth. All teams played in the conference quarterfinals: first-place versus eighth, second versus seventh, third versus sixth, and fourth versus fifth; after each round, the surviving teams were reseeded to play the conference semifinals, then a conference final, with the conference champions playing against each other in the Stanley Cup Finals. Home ice advantage was determined by higher seed in the first three rounds and by regular season points of the two teams in the Stanley Cup Finals. All series were best of seven, but the arrangement of home games was changed for Central and Pacific division teams. Instead of the normal 2–2–1–1–1 rotation, a series involving teams from both divisions was 2–3–2, with the higher-seeded team having the option of starting play at home or on the road (the format was used four times in 1994, between 1995 and 1998, all higher-seeded teams opted to start play at home with the 2–2–1–1–1 format).\nFor the 1998–99 season, the league re-organized into two conferences of three divisions apiece, resulting in the playoff format used through the 2012–13 season. The qualifiers remained sixteen, but the seeding changed. The three first-place teams in each division qualified and were seeded first through third for the playoffs; of the other teams in each conference, the top five finishers qualified for the fourth through eighth seeds. The format otherwise remained identical to that of the 1994–1998 system.\nThe NHL realigned into a four-division, two-conference system for the 2013–14 season. Under the postseason system from 2014 to 2019 and 2022 onward, the top three teams in each division make the playoffs, with two wild-cards in each conference (for a total of eight playoff teams from each conference). The format is division-based, similar to the 1982 system. In the First Round, the top-ranked team in the conference plays against the lowest-ranked wild-card, while the other division winner plays against the higher-ranked wild-card. The second- and third-place teams in each division play each other. The first-round winners then meet in the Second Round. The third round still consists of the Western Conference and Eastern Conference finals, with those conference winners advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals.\nTemporary formats during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSpecial formats were used in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs a result of the pandemic prematurely ending the 2019–20 regular season, a 24-team, conference-based format (with 12 from each conference) was adopted for the 2020 playoffs. Seeding was based on each team's points percentage at the time the regular season was suspended on March 12. The top four teams competed in a round-robin tournament to determine final seeding in the First Round, while the bottom eight seeds in each conference played in a best-of-five series to determine who advanced to face one of the Round-Robin teams in the First Round. Teams then were reseeded after each round similar to the conference-based formats used from 1994 to 2013.\nThe closure of the Canada–United States border during the 2020–21 regular season caused the NHL to temporarily abolish both conferences and realign into four different divisions, putting all Canadian teams into one of those divisions. The top four teams in each division then made the 2021 playoffs. All four rounds of the playoffs remained as best-of-seven series, and the first two rounds of the playoffs featured intra-divisional matchups similar to the division-based formats previously used. The four division champions were reseeded based on regular season point total in the Stanley Cup Semifinals. The best-ranked division winner played against the worst-ranked division winner, while the other two division champions faced-off against each other, with the second-best division champion having home-ice advantage. The winners of these series advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals, as before.\nTraditions and trends.\nCompared to other major professional sports leagues, playoff upsets are relatively common in the NHL. According to NHL broadcaster Darren Eliot, this is because the style of competition in the playoffs is different from the regular season: instead of playing different teams every night, the goal is to advance through four best-of-seven playoff series. The Presidents' Trophy winner may have to go through other playoff clubs who might have a better goaltender, a better defensive team, or other players that pose matchup problems. If the regular season champion's primary success was only outscoring others, they may be out of luck facing goaltenders that can shut them out. For the first time, during the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs, all division winners were eliminated in the first round, which also saw the first instance that a Presidents' Trophy winner was swept 4–0 in the opening round.\nAnd although rare, another aspect is that the NHL leads the other leagues in game seven comebacks. In four instances an NHL team has been able to come back from being down 0–3 to win a seven-game series: the 1941–42 Toronto Maple Leafs, the 1974–75 New York Islanders, the 2009–10 Philadelphia Flyers, and the 2013–14 Los Angeles Kings. There has been only one such \"reverse sweep\" comeback in MLB postseason (the 2004 Boston Red Sox) and none in the NBA playoffs.\nDespite having more American-based teams than Canadian-based ones throughout much of the NHL's existence (dating back to the Original Six era when it was two Canadian clubs to four American ones, and now 7 to 25 since 2021), there have been only two times in league history where none of the Canadian teams qualified for the postseason: 1970 and 2016. However, the 1992–93 Montreal Canadiens remain the last Canadian club to win the Stanley Cup, as of 2023.\nThe Stanley Cup playoffs MVP award, the Conn Smythe Trophy is based on the \"entire\" NHL postseason instead of just the championship game or series, unlike the playoff MVP awards presented in the other major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada (the Super Bowl MVP, the NBA Finals MVP, and the World Series MVP), although in its history the trophy has never been given to someone that was not in the finals. Doug Gilmour and Peter Forsberg, in 1986 and 1999, respectively, are the only players who have topped the postseason in scoring without making it to the Finals.\nNHL players have often grown beards when their team is in the playoffs, where they do not shave until their team is eliminated or wins the Stanley Cup. The tradition was started in the 1980s by the New York Islanders, and is often mirrored by the fans, as well.\nAt the conclusion of a playoff series, players and coaches line up and exchange handshakes with their counterparts on the opposing team, and this has been described by commentators as \"one of the great traditions in sports\". However, there have been rare occasions that individual players have refused to participate, such as Gerry Cheevers who left the ice without shaking hands with any of the Flyers in 1978, and Billy Smith who avoided handshakes as he was particularly passionate about losses. More recent examples of players refusing the handshake include the 1996 playoffs when several Detroit Red Wings players protested the dirty hit by the Colorado Avalanche's Claude Lemieux, and in the 2008 playoffs when Martin Brodeur refused to shake Sean Avery's hand after Avery screened him in an earlier game.\nIt is common among players to never touch or hoist the Prince of Wales Trophy (Eastern Conference champion) or Clarence S. Campbell Bowl (Western Conference champion) after they have won the conference finals; the players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and thus it should be the only trophy that they should be hoisting. However, there have been many exceptions to this. Nineteen of the conference champions since 1997 have touched the trophy, of which 8 teams went on to win the Stanley Cup – Scott Stevens of the Devils in 2000 and 2003; Sidney Crosby of the Penguins in 2009, 2016, and 2017; Alexander Ovechkin of the Capitals in 2018; and Steven Stamkos of the Lightning in 2020. In recent years, the captain of the winning team poses (usually looking solemn) with the conference trophy, and sometimes, the entire team poses as well.\nThere are many traditions and anecdotes associated with the championship trophy, the Stanley Cup.\nBecause the Ice Hockey World Championships are held in the same time period as the Stanley Cup playoffs, the only NHL players who can participate in the former are those on NHL teams that have been eliminated from Stanley Cup contention. This policy has been in place since a 1977 agreement between the NHL and the International Ice Hockey Federation, which allowed Team Canada to field a team in the World Championships after an-eight year absence.\nPostseason appearances.\n\"Correct as of 2024 Stanley Cup playoffs\""

        "title": "Rugby union in Israel",
        "text": "Rugby union in Israel was brought to the country by British soldiers during the British Mandate for Palestine. Rugby Israel was founded as the Israel Rugby Union in 1975, and joined the IRB in 1988. For political reasons it is also part of FIRA-AER, the European rugby body, rather than the Asian Rugby Football Union.\nHistory.\nRugby union was brought to the country by British soldiers during the Mandate era. Around the same time, there was an influx of Jews from various parts of the British Commonwealth and the Francophonie who tried to establish the game. In the 1950s, Leo Camron, a former player for Natal, organised teams amongst the various immigrants, and within the IDF.\nPost-War rugby found a new advocate in South African Leo Camron. A graduate of Natal University, Camron was a former artillery captain of the South African Army who had served in the North African campaigns of WWII, and went to Palestine to join Machal and fight in the 1947–1949 Palestine war. In South Africa, Camron had also played for the Natal rugby team. In 1951, succeeded in obtaining an appointment in the sports department of the IDF.\nIn 1952, Camron organised independent Israel's first rugby match, between a group of South Africans, and a team of parachutists in the IDF. The South Africans won 18–6. The match ball was somewhat unusual, being a shoe wrapped in a towel. The game proved fairly popular in the IDF, thanks partly to its emphasis on aggression and team tactics. Camron soon organised other games, mainly between soldiers, and immigrants from the British Commonwealth.\nCamron made an attempt to get the IDF to adopt the game, but was unsuccessful due to institutional bureaucracy. This was a bitter blow to his campaign, and led to him taking a more passive role in Israeli rugby, until his death in 2007.\nIsraeli rugby went into decline during the 1960s, until in the 1970s, a new wave of immigrants from rugby playing countries arrived, particularly from South Africa. A major focus for the Israeli game was the \"Kibbutz\" Yizre'el () near Afula in the north west of the country, which had a number of South Africans living in it. It also garnered an interest in areas with large English-speaking populations such as Ra'anana () in west Central Israel and Jerusalem.\nA national league was set up in 1972, and the Israel Rugby Union (now Rugby Israel) formed in 1975.\nMaccabiah Games and Internationals.\nIsrael's first international match was away to Switzerland on 25 May 1981, and ended 9-9.\nIsrael rugby in this period countered its isolation, by building up contacts with British military teams based in Cyprus, and teams and organisations based in South Africa and France.\nThe game was given a further shot in the arm when it was included in the four-yearly Maccabiah Games in 1981 - the so-called \"Jewish Olympics\" - in 1993, it was won by a South African national Jewish side.\nThe high point of Israeli rugby has been seen as their shock 67–8 win against Hungary in the World Cup Qualifiers, which did much to promote the sport within Israel.\nIn 1989, Chris Thau claims that Israel had eight clubs (a figure which has remained fairly steady), and around 400 players (a number which has increased somewhat).\nIsrael has also entered the Rugby World Cup Sevens.\nRoughly 70% of Israeli players are now locally born.\nNational team.\nThe national team is in the third tier of international rugby. Their first match was away to Switzerland on 25 May 1981, and ended 9-9. They participated in the European section of the qualifying rounds for the 1991 Rugby World Cup. In a group with Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland, Israel lost all three matches, but were by no means humiliated.\nIn the qualifying matches for the 1995 World Cup, Israel thrashed Hungary 67–8 in the preliminary round, before being knocked out in the Round 1 group stage, failing to score a point in two of their three games.\nThe qualifying matches for the 1999 Rugby World Cup followed the established pattern, with Israel being knocked out in the group stage, though they avoided finishing bottom of their five-team group by beating Austria. The same happened in the 2003 WC qualifiers, where they finished fourth in a six team group. In the 2007 WC qualifiers they did not even make it to the group stage, being thrashed 113–7 on aggregate by Lithuania. In April 2007, they were ranked 93rd out of 95 IRB member nations.\nTheir home ground is at Wingate Institute.\nDomestic rugby.\nRugby is most popular amongst English speaking immigrants, particularly those from South Africa, Australia, and the UK, and a lesser extent New Zealand and North America. There are also players from other parts of the world, particularly France, Italy, Georgia and other parts of Europe where the game is popular.\nRugby has a low take up rate amongst the Arab Israeli population, and Mizrachi, although some originate in countries such as Morocco and Tunisia with a significant rugby tradition.\nThere is at least one Druze player and some Christians (particularly in Jerusalem), but the game does not appear to be popular amongst Muslims.\nWith the exception of Beit Jala Lions, based in Bethlehem, there is little rugby to speak of in the West Bank or Gaza, and contact with neighbouring Arab communities is low.\nThe first league was set up in 1972 with five clubs, and was played over the 1972/3 season. Initially the league was run by the players themselves, but in a general meeting in 1975, it was decided to set up a committee to run the game.\nSince then the league has fluctuated between six and ten teams, with six members at the start of the 2006/7 season:\nThere are four women's teams;\nFormer clubs.\nGolan gorillas \nThere is also a Golden Oldies club called the Elders of Zion.\nWomen's rugby.\nAlthough Israel's women have not yet played test match rugby, they have been playing international sevens rugby since 2005.

        "text": "Francisco José Martin (born March 23, 1966) is an American basketball coach serving as the head coach for the University of Massachusetts men's basketball team. Martin was previously the head coach of the University of South Carolina men's basketball team for ten seasons. Prior to that, he was the head coach of Kansas State University for five seasons.\nMartin has led his teams to a total of five NCAA tournaments and 1 Final Four appearance as a head coach. He was named the Big 12 Conference Men's Basketball Coach of the Year in 2010. He won the Jim Phelan Award in 2017.\nEarly life and career.\nMartin, who grew up in Miami, Florida, is the son of Cuban political exiles and the first American-born member of his family. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in physical education from Florida International University in 1993. One of the two jobs he held while attending FIU was that of a bouncer at a local nightclub. He decided to become a full-time basketball coach in 1992 as a result of an incident in which he was subjected to gunfire, while on duty, from a group of men whom he had ejected for fighting.\nAt the same time, he had begun his career in basketball as the head coach of the boys' junior varsity squad at Miami High School in 1985. He served in that position for eight years until he was appointed to his first varsity coaching job at North Miami High School after he completed his studies at FIU in 1993. He returned to Miami Senior two years later to head its varsity team. Under his watch, the Stingarees won three consecutive state championships from 1996 to 1998 with teams featuring future NBA players Udonis Haslem and Steve Blake. The last of those titles was later vacated due to recruiting violations involving school employees and boosters who gave housing assistance to the players. Although he was never personally accused of any wrongdoing, Martin was dismissed in 1999. He next served as head coach at Booker T. Washington High School for one year.\nCollege coaching career.\nMartin joined the college ranks as an assistant coach/recruiting coordinator at Northeastern University from 2000 to 2004. He moved to the University of Cincinnati, serving one season each under Bob Huggins and Andy Kennedy. Martin followed Huggins to Kansas State, joining his staff on April 5, 2006. On April 6, 2007, almost a year to the day after his arrival in Manhattan, Martin was named head coach of the Wildcats in the wake of Huggins' resignation.\nKansas State.\nMartin's first season as head coach at Kansas State was marked by a number of noteworthy events. The 2007–2008 Wildcats, featuring star freshman Michael Beasley, were included in the preseason Top 25 for the first time since 1972. On January 19, 2008, Martin's Wildcats defeated then-No. 10 Texas A&amp;M, giving the team its first win over a ranked team in nearly a year, and its first victory over a Top 10 team since beating Texas in March 2004. On January 30, 2008, Martin led Kansas State to an 84–75 victory over then-No. 2 Kansas, marking the Wildcats' first home win over their in-state rival since 1983. Ultimately, Martin led Kansas State to its first berth in the NCAA tournament since 1996.\nMartin was awarded the Big 12 Conference Coach of the Year by the conference on March 7, 2010. Later that month, he led the Wildcats to the Elite 8, their best tournament performance since 1988.\nHe was given a contract extension through the 2014–2015 season. His salary increased to $1.2 million, plus incentives, for 2010–11. The salary would increase by $100,000 a year for each subsequent year of the contract, topping out at $1.6 million in 2014–15.\nAfter Frank Haith left Miami to take the Missouri head coaching job in the spring of 2011, there were rumors that Martin, born and raised in Miami, might leave Kansas State to take the job. These rumors ended when it was announced that Jim Larranaga took the job at Miami.\nSouth Carolina.\nOn March 26, 2012, in a text message to ESPN, Martin confirmed he had accepted the head coach position at South Carolina. On March 27, 2012, Martin was introduced as South Carolina's head coach, replacing Darrin Horn.\nMartin posted losing records in each of his first two seasons at South Carolina, including a combined conference mark of 9–27. His team's most notable victory in those two seasons was a 72–67 home win against #17 Kentucky on March 1, 2014. During the 2013–14 season, Martin issued a public apology to fans and players on January 21, 2014, after a verbal tirade during the team's loss to Ole Miss. On March 6, 2014, USC Athletic Director Ray Tanner suspended Martin for the final game of the regular season for further \"inappropriate verbal communication\" with players.\nIn Martin's third season at South Carolina, he recorded his first winning season at South Carolina with a 17–16 (6–12) record. The team posted a 9–3 record in its non-conference season, concluding with a win over #9 Iowa State at the Brooklyn Hoops Showcase, and followed this by finishing its SEC regular season with a 6–12 record, then posting a 2–1 mark in the SEC Tournament.\nThe 2015–16 season continued the upward trend as his Gamecocks won 24 regular season games, including a 13–0 mark in non-conference games. The 11–7 mark in conference was good enough to tie for third in the SEC, but after losing to Georgia in the SEC tournament, South Carolina accepted an NIT bid.\nThe 2016–17 team finally broke through and earned a bid as a #7 seed to the 2017 NCAA tournament, where they earned their first win in the event since 1973 with a 20-point victory over the #10 seed Marquette Golden Eagles, followed by a win over #2 seed Duke, advancing to the program's first Sweet 16 in school history. The Gamecocks then beat Baylor to advance to the Elite 8 for the first time in school history. On Sunday, March 26, 2017, South Carolina defeated Florida in the East Regional Final to reach the school's first-ever Final Four. They played Gonzaga on April 1, 2017, and lost 77–73, ending their road to the national championship.\nFollowing the run to the Final Four, the Gamecocks failed to reach postseason play in Martin's remaining tenure. Martin was dismissed as the head coach of South Carolina on March 14, 2022. At the time of his dismissal, he was the third winningest coach at South Carolina with a 171–147 (79–99 SEC) record.\nMassachusetts.\nOn March 25, 2022, it was announced that Martin had agreed to a deal to become the next head coach at the University of Massachusetts. The team performed well at the outset of Martin's inaugural campaign, winning eight of its first nine contests, before struggling down the stretch and finishing 15-16.. After a loss to St. Joseph's, Martin used his postgame press conference to criticize members of the UMass fan base for what he described as their attacks on social media.\nPersonal life.\nMartin is married to Anya Forrest, a former star athlete and alumna of the University of Massachusetts. They have three children, Brandon, Amalia, and Christian. Brandon played for his father at both South Carolina and Massachusetts."

Listed at and 165 pounds, Tucker was a switch hitter and threw right-handed.\nBaseball career.\nTucker was born in Holyoke, Massachusetts, in 1863 and started his baseball career playing for the Springfield and Newark clubs. He was a flashy first baseman in an era when using two hands was normal, making one-handed scoops of wild throws and pick-ups with his small glove, in contrast to the bigger gloves employed by later first basemen.\nTucker entered the majors in 1887 with the Baltimore Orioles of the American Association, playing for them three years before joining the National League with the Boston Beaneaters (1890–1897), Washington Senators (1897), Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1898), St. Louis Browns (1898) and Cleveland Spiders (1899).\nTucker's most productive season was in 1889 with Baltimore, when he led AA hitters with a .372 batting average (still the highest league-leading average ever for a switch hitter) and 196 hits. His .372 average was 118 points above the Baltimore team average of .254.\nOn July 22, 1893, Tucker tied a major league record with four doubles in a single game. He posted a 6-for-6 game on July 15, 1897.\nIn his 13-season MLB career, Tucker was a .290 hitter (1882-for-6482) with 42 home runs and 932 RBI in 1688 games played, and he had 1084 runs, 240 doubles, 85 triples, and 352 stolen bases.\nTucker was hit by a pitch 272 times during his career, which was a major league record. He currently ranks third on the all-time list behind Hughie Jennings (287) and Craig Biggio (285), and over Don Baylor (267).\nTucker had a reputation of being one of the toughest players of his era. He was notorious for hip-checking base runners off first base and then tagging them out. He received the nickname \"Noisy Tom\" in Boston, while \"Foghorn Tom\" was among the many names by which he was known in Baltimore.\nTucker died in Montague, Massachusetts, in 1935."

Nicknamed \"The Barn,\" it opened in 1946. It was replaced when Beard-Eaves-Memorial Coliseum opened in 1969. Auburn Sports Arena stood until September 21, 1996, when it caught fire and burned down in the middle of a football game between Auburn and LSU.\nBeard–Eaves–Memorial Coliseum.\nBeard–Eaves–Memorial Coliseum is a 10,500-seat multipurpose arena that opened in 1969 under the name Memorial Coliseum.

Auburn had a winning record at home in 37 of the 42 seasons Auburn played in the Coliseum. Auburn's 30-game home winning streak from the 1997–98 season to the final game of the 1999–2000 season was the longest in Coliseum history. It was the nation's second longest current winning streak at the time and is the second longest home winning streak in Auburn history.\nAuburn played its final season in Beard–Eaves–Memorial Coliseum in the 2009–10 season. Auburn's final game in Beard–Eaves–Memorial Coliseum was on March 3, 2010; Auburn beat Mississippi State 89–80.\nNeville Arena.\nOn June 29, 2007, Auburn announced plans to build a new $92.5 million basketball arena and practice facilities that would eventually be completed for the 2010–11 season.

Auburn currently holds a record in Neville Arena.\nTraditions.\nRivalries.\nAlabama.\nSometimes referred to as the \"Iron Bowl of Basketball,\" Auburn and Alabama have a fierce rivalry that dates back to 1924. Auburn and Alabama first met in the Southern Conference Tournament on March 1, 1924, and Auburn lost 19–40. The two programs did not meet again until 1941 in the SEC tournament, a matchup that Auburn lost again 16–38. The programs have played regularly since 1948, meeting at least twice every season starting in 1949. Auburn's first win in the rivalry came in their sixth meeting on December 20, 1949, when Auburn beat Alabama 45–40.\nAuburn and Alabama have met in the SEC Tournament 9 times, including Auburn's 53–49 overtime victory over Alabama in the 1985 SEC Tournament championship game. Alabama leads the all-time series 101–67.\nGeorgia.\nGeorgia is Auburn's oldest rival, first meeting in 1908 in Columbus, GA. Auburn won that game 34–20. Auburn and Georgia have played at least once every year since 1945. Auburn leads the all-time series 99–96.\nUAB.\nThough Auburn and UAB have met just 21 times, the two programs have a strong history. The first game between the two schools was played on November 26, 1982, a matchup won by Auburn, 63–61. The programs met 16 more times over the next two decades until the series was discontinued after the 1999–2000 season. In 2015, Auburn and UAB agreed to a four-game series that reignited the rivalry. Auburn leads the all-time series 11–10.\nStudent section.\nAuburn's student section is known as The Jungle. Auburn held a vote to name their student section at the start of the 2011–12 season, and The Jungle was chosen from several options. Auburn officially started The Jungle on January 11, 2012, for the Auburn–Kentucky game. The Jungle was awarded the Sixth Man Award at the 2012 team banquet for its \"outstanding support throughout the season and making Auburn Arena one of the loudest venues in the SEC.\"\nThe Auburn student section was previously known as Lebo's Lunatics during Jeff Lebo's tenure at Auburn and the Cliff Dwellers during Cliff Ellis' tenure."

        "title": "Spare (bowling)",
        "text": "A spare is a term used in bowling to indicate that all of the pins have been knocked down during the second ball of a frame when not all the pins were knocked down in the first frame of that player's two turns. The symbol for a spare for most bowling sports is a forward slash mark (/), while the unique vertically-oriented scoring system for candlepin bowling is somewhat different.\nA \"spare\" is awarded when no pins are left standing after the second ball of a frame; i.e., a player uses both balls of a frame to clear all ten pins. A player achieving a spare is awarded ten points, plus a bonus of whatever is scored with the next ball (only the first ball is counted). It is typically rendered as a slash on score sheets in place of the second pin count for a frame.\nA player who bowls a spare in the tenth (final) frame is awarded one extra ball to allow for the bonus points.\nCorrectly calculating bonus points can be difficult and time-consuming, especially when combinations of strikes and spares come in consecutive frames. In modern times, however, this has been overcome with automated scoring systems (also known as score keepers), linked to the machines that set and clear the pins between frames. A computer automatically counts pins that remain standing, and fills in a virtual score sheet (usually displayed on monitors above each lane). However, even the automated system is not fool-proof, as the computer can miscount the number of pins that remain standing.\nThe term \"hard spare\" refers when no pins are knocked down on the first ball, due to a foot foul or a ball thrown into the gutter, and then a spare is converted with all ten pins remaining with the second ball. This is sometimes mocked as throwing a strike one ball too late.\nSince throwing three strikes in a row is referred to as a \"turkey,\" three spares in a row is most commonly referred to as a “sparrow.\""

        "title": "Strike (bowling)",
        "text": "In bowling, a strike means that all of the pins have been knocked down on the first ball roll of a frame. On a bowling scoresheet, a strike is marked by an \"X\".\nIn American nine-pin bowling, a ringer is an equivalent term for knocking down all pins on the first ball of the frame (known as a \"full house\").\nScoring.\nWhen all ten pins are knocked down with the first ball roll (called a strike and typically rendered as an \"X\" on a score sheet), a player is awarded ten points, plus a bonus of whatever is scored with the next two rolls (not necessarily the next two frames). In this way, the points scored for the two rolls after the strike are counted twice.\nAn easier non-standard method of scoring a strike is to score the strike with a flat 10 points and then add 1 to the multiplier of the next two rolls. Thus, the scoring of the above example would play out as below:\nStrike scoring works similarly for five-pin bowling, except strikes are worth 15 points rather than 10 (as the pins are scored with the values of 2, 3, 5, 3, and 2).\nConsecutive strikes.\nA series of two strikes is known as a \"double\" (or a \"Barney Rubble\" to rhyme), and a series of three is known as a \"turkey\" (sometimes a \"sizzling turkey\" on the first three frames). Any longer string of strikes is referred to by a number affixed to the word \"bagger\" or \"pack\", as in \"four-bagger\" or \"six-pack\". A string of four straight strikes is also known as a \"hambone \" a term invented by sports commentator Rob Stone. A string of five strikes in a row is a \"brat,\" referring to bratwurst, but \"nickel,\" has become far more common in recent years.\nWhen a player is \"on the strikes\", a string is often referenced by affixing \"in a row\" to the number of consecutive strikes. A string of six strikes is sometimes called a \"six pack\" or a \"sixer\". A string of six and nine strikes are also known as a \"wild turkey\" and a \"golden turkey\" respectively. Any string of strikes starting in the first frame or ending \"off the sheet\" (where all of a bowler's shots from a certain frame to the end of the game strike) are often called the \"front\" or \"back\" strikes, respectively (e.g. the 'front nine' for strikes in frames 1-9, or the 'back six' for strikes in frames 7, 8, and 9 with a turkey in the tenth). Twelve strikes in a row is a perfect game; 36 straight strikes constitutes a 900 series. Due to the difficulty of achieving a game of 300 or a series of 900, many bowling alleys maintain 300 and 900 club plaques.\nWith the simpler non-standard system of scoring, the above example would be scored as below:"

Leach pressured the usually consistent Gilbert into errors and thrilled the collegiate tennis world by winning the 1982 NCAA singles title in straight sets (7–5, 6–3). He became only the second Wolverine to win the national title, joining Barry MacKay who won the singles title in 1957. He was also a two-time Big Ten Conference doubles champion with Matt Horwitch in 1980 and with Mark Mees in 1982.

The highest break of the tournament was a 135 compiled by Dennis Taylor, for which he earned £7,500.\nIn the final, defending champion Stephen Hendry performed what is considered to be one of the greatest comebacks in snooker history, when he defeated Mike Hallett 9–8, after trailing 0–7 and 2–8 earlier in the match.\nWorld number 1 Hendry went into the final as a firm 1/6 favourite, and with 9–3 Hendry being the most favoured score with the bookies, but world number 7 Hallett played one of the most dominant snooker sessions by an underdog to win all 7 frames of the afternoon session to take a 7–0 lead. In the first frame of the evening session, Hallett missed the final pink that would have made it 8–0, with Hendry then potting the pink and black to win his first frame of the match. Hendry reduced his arrears to 2–7, but then Hallett made it 8–2 and just one frame from victory. With the Masters title in his sights, Hallett just needed to pot the final pink and black in the eleventh frame to win the match, but he narrowly missed the pink with the rest, allowing Hendry to pot the pink to win the frame and reduce his arrears to 3–8. Despite Hallett having numerous chances in the following six frames, including in the last frame where Hallett led until the last few balls, Hendry eventually made a historic recovery to win 9–8.\nPlaces in the tournament were allocated to the top 16 players in the world rankings. World number one Stephen Hendry was the number 1 seed. Players seeded 15 and 16 (Tony Meo and Alain Robidoux) competed in the wild-card round against Alan McManus, who was the winner of the qualifying event, and Gary Wilkinson (ranked 19), who was the wild-card selection. Martin Clark (ranked 12), Alan McManus, Alain Robidoux, and Gary Wilkinson were making their Masters debuts.\nQualifying Event.\nAlan McManus won the qualifying tournament, known as the 1990 Benson &amp; Hedges Satellite Championship at the time beating James Wattana 9–5 in the final to qualify for the main tournament at Wembley.

        "text": "Anthony Currie (born November 12, 1957) is a Canadian former ice hockey forward who spent eight seasons in the National Hockey League between 1977 and 1985 with the St. Louis Blues, Vancouver Canucks, and Hartford Whalers. Currie also spent several years in the minor leagues, and the last several years of his career were spent in Europe, where he played in Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, retiring in 1990.\nEarly life.\nCurrie was born in Sydney Mines. As a youth, he played in the 1970 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Oromocto.\nCareer.\nCurrie was a selected 63rd overall in the 1977 NHL amateur draft by the St. Louis Blues following a 73-goal season for the Portland Winter Hawks of the WHL. He played 22 games for the Blues in 1977–78. During the 1979–80 season, he posting 19 goals in 40 games once called up to St. Louis. In 1980–81, he recorded 55 points in 61 games, helping the Blues to a second place overall finish in the regular season. In the playoffs, he recorded 16 points and a then-franchise record 12 assists in 11 games.\nHowever, Currie struggled throughout his career to maintain a consistent roster spot as coaches felt his poor defensive game and lack of size and physical play overshadowed his ability to create offense . He continued to produce well in 1981–82, notching 40 points in 48 games, before being dealt to the Vancouver Canucks at the trade deadline. He added 5 more goals for Vancouver to finish with 23 in just 60 games to match his career high from the previous season, but appeared in only three games in the playoffs as Vancouver went on a surprising run to the Stanley Cup Finals.\nNot a favourite of defensive-minded Canuck coach Roger Neilson, and despite his high level of production to that point of his career, Currie found himself back in the minors for most of the next two seasons, appearing in only 26 more games for the team. Released by Vancouver mid-way through the 1983–84 season, Currie signed with the Hartford Whalers. He posted 14 goals and 28 points in just 32 games for the Whalers. Despite posting 11 points in 13 games to start the 1984–85 campaign, he was waived by the Whalers. He spent two more seasons in the minors before moving to Europe and retiring in 1990.\nCurrie finished his NHL career with totals of 92 goals and 119 assists for 211 points in 290 NHL games, along with 73 penalty minutes.\nPersonal life.\nCurrie has two sons."

        "text": "William Donald Stewart (born October 6, 1957) is a Canadian-born Italian former professional ice hockey defenceman and former coach. He played in the National Hockey League between 1977 and 1986, and then played in the Italian Serie A from 1986 to 1995. He later became a coach for the New York Islanders during the 1998–99 season. Internationally Stewart played for the Italian national team at the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics, and two World Championships.\nPlaying career.\nAs a youth, Stewart played in the 1969 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from York Mills. A native of Toronto, Ontario, he was drafted in the fourth round (68th overall) in the 1977 NHL Entry Draft by the Buffalo Sabres and started his National Hockey League career in 1977-78. He also went on to play for the St. Louis Blues, Toronto Maple Leafs, and Minnesota North Stars. He left the NHL at the end of the 1985–86 season choosing to play hockey in Italy until his retirement in 1995.\nCoaching career.\nStewart began his professional coaching career with the Muskegon Fury of the Colonial Hockey League in 1995. After one season with Muskegon, Stewart took the head coaching position with the Oshawa Generals of the OHL in 1996. Stewart got back into coaching professional hockey the following season with a stint in the American Hockey League and coaching the Saint John Flames to the Calder Cup Finals in 1998, losing to the Philadelphia Phantoms in six games.\nStewart was named head coach of the New York Islanders on January 21, 1999, after Mike Milbury himself stepped down to concentrate solely on his GM duties. After finishing the season with the Islanders, Stewart was relieved of his coaching duties and was replaced by Butch Goring on April 30, 1999.\nIn 1999, Stewart returned to the OHL to become the head coach of the Barrie Colts. The roster that year included the four \"Brampton Boys\", one of whom, Ryan Barnes, faced charges of assault with a weapon after a stick-swinging incident during a game in October. Later in the season, three of the team's other players were charged with sexual assault. Finally, Stewart himself made headlines and was banned from entering the United States for twice smuggling a Ukrainian-born player over the Canada-U.S. border in the baggage compartment of the team bus. Stewart infamously walked out of the Halifax Metro Centre without conducting any interviews with the media, following Barrie's 6-2 loss to the Rimouski Océanic in the 2000 Memorial Cup championship game.\nFollowing the controversial season in Barrie, Stewart continued his coaching career in Germany, and made headlines during the DEL quarterfinals in 2001 when he was involved in a mass brawl in game three against the Berlin Capitals, during which he hit Capitals' head coach Pavel Gross in the head and Stewart was injured as well. He was handed a two-game suspension and a DM 15,000 fine. In the finals against the München Barons, he feigned fainting behind the Adler Mannheim bench to buy his star player Jan Alston time to get his skates sharpened. His team ended up winning the championship that year and got to the finals the following season. Stewart left Mannheim in January 2003 after being informed that his contract would not be extended at the end of the season.\nAfter a short stint in Krefeld, Stewart moved to Austria, where he coached the Graz 99ers and EHC Linz. He left Linz in December 2006 to return to Germany with the Hamburg Freezers. Linz challenged this transfer by seeking a restraining order, but lost the case. Stewart was sacked by the Freezers in December 2008.\nOn December 3, 2009, he agreed to take over as the head coach of Kölner Haie and was relieved of his duties in November 2011. He joined the Guelph Storm during the 2011-12 season as a consultant prior to being named assistant coach in 2012-13. He took over as interim head coach of the team in January 2015. The term \"interim\" was then removed prior to the end of the season. He resigned from the Storm in December 2015 after only two wins and went back to Germany in January 2016 to coach Dresdner Eislöwen of the DEL2.\nStewart was appointed head coach of the DEL's Straubing Tigers in April 2017. Concerning his past, he stated at that time: \"I have experienced a lot in Europe, have had great success, but have to admit that I have gone too far at times. These moments happened some years ago and, in the meantime, I have learned and become more quiet.\" He was sacked as Straubing head coach on October 18, 2017, after his team won only five of the first 13 games of the season and dropped to the very bottom of the DEL standings.\nOn December 4, 2017, Stewart was named head of Adler Mannheim, returning for a second stint in charge at the club. His contract expired at the end of the 2017-18 season in which he guided the Adler team to an appearance in the playoff semifinals. He subsequently worked as a scout for the Adler organization."

The NF-Board hoped that sixteen teams would take part, drawn from across its membership.\nControversy.\nIn the Spring of 2005, a new government was elected in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, keen to foster relations with other nations. The NF-Board claimed that the government of Ferdi Sabit Soyer insisted on restricting which nations could and could not take part in order to head off potential political arguments. For their part, the KTFF claimed that the NF-Board made unreasonable financial demands.\nThe upshot of this was that the NF-Board decided to grant the hosting rights for the tournament to Occitania. In response, the KTFF announced that they would hold their own tournament, the ELF Cup, scheduled for the same time as the VIVA World Cup. Some NF-Board members have accepted invitations to take part in the ELF Cup.\nOccitania 2006.\nOccitania announced that the tournament would still be held from 19–25 November 2006, with games played in and around Hyères les Palmiers, near Toulon. The number of entrants was downsized to eight, in anticipation of the ELF Cup - which agreed to pay expenses - drawing NF-Board members away from the VIVA World Cup. However, a lack of suitable competitors meant that the tournament was to include six teams: Monaco, the Roma, the Sápmi, Southern Cameroons, West Papua, and the hosts.\nHowever, the failure of West Papua and Southern Cameroon to attend the NF-Board General Assembly in September 2006, and logistical problems facing the Roma, threw new doubt on the tournament, which looked as though it may go ahead with just three teams. Fortunately, Southern Cameroons were able to agree to send a team, and four teams - twelve fewer than initially hoped for - were set to contest the title.\nThere were yet more problems for the organisers when Southern Cameroons were unable to take part because of visa problems, resulting in walkovers in all their games.\nBy the end of the week, Sápmi had triumphed, scoring 42 goals in their three games, and lifting the first VIVA World Cup trophy.\nSquads.\nFor a list of all squads that appeared in the final tournament, see \"2006 VIVA World Cup squads\".\nResults.\nThe four teams played a round-robin group stage, with the top two playing off for the title."

        "title": "Cricket in Australia",
        "text": "Cricket is the most popular summer sport in Australia at international, domestic and local levels. It is regarded as the national summer sport, and widely played across the country, especially from the months of September to April. The peak administrative body for both professional and amateur cricket is Cricket Australia. The 2017–18 National Cricket Census showed 1,558,821 Australians engaged in cricket competitions or programs – an increase of 9% from the previous year. 30% of cricket's participants are now female, and 6 in every 10 new participants are female, one of the highest year-on-year participation growth figures. In terms of attendance figures, more than 2.3 million people attended the cricket during the 2017–18 summer, surpassing the record of 1.8 million set in 2016–17.\nSeparately, official audience data shows that 93.6% of Australians watched at least some cricket on TV in 2010–11 calendar year.\nHistory.\n1803–1939.\nCricket has been played in Australia for over 210 years. The first recorded cricket match in Australia took place in Sydney in December 1803 and a report in the Sydney Gazette on 8 January 1804 suggested that cricket was already well established in the infant colony. Intercolonial cricket in Australia started with a visit by cricketers from Victoria to Tasmania in February 1851. The match was played in Launceston on 11–12 February with Tasmania winning by 3 wickets.\nThe first tour by an English team to Australia was in 1861–62, organised by the catering firm of Spiers and Pond as a private enterprise. A further tour followed in 1863–64, led by George Parr and was even more successful than the last.\nIn 1868, a team consisting of Aboriginal cricketers became the first Australian team to tour England. The team played 47 matches, winning 14, drawing 19 and losing 14. The heavy workload and inclement weather took its toll with King Cole contracting a fatal case of tuberculosis during the tour.\nFurther tours by English teams took place in 1873–74 (featuring the most notable cricketer of the age W. G. Grace) and 1876–77. The 1876–77 season was notable for a match between a combined XI from New South Wales and Victoria and the touring Englishmen at the Melbourne Cricket Ground played on 15–19 March. This match, later to be recognised as the first Test match, was won by Australia by 45 runs thanks mainly to an unbeaten 165 by Charles Bannerman. The result of this match was seen by Australians and Englishmen as a reflection of the rising standard of Australian cricket.\nThe rising standards of Australian cricket was further established during the first representative tour of England in 1878. A return visit in 1878–79 is best remembered for a riot and by the time Australia visited England in 1880, playing the first Test in England at The Oval, a system of international tours was well established. A famous victory on the 1882 tour of England resulted in the placement of a satirical obituary in an English newspaper, \"The Sporting Times.\" The obituary stated that English cricket had died, and the \"body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia\". The English media then dubbed the next English tour to Australia (1882–83) as the quest to regain The Ashes. The Sheffield Shield, the premier first-class cricket competition in Australia, was established in 1892 by the Australasian Cricket Council, the first attempt at a national cricket board.\nThe era from the mid-1890s to World War I has been described as Australian cricket's golden age. This era saw the emergence of players such as Monty Noble, Clem Hill and in particular Victor Trumper, who was idolised by the Australian public. World War I led to the suspension of both international and Sheffield Shield cricket and the enlistment of many cricketers in the AIF. After the war, a team consisting of cricketers enlisted in the AIF toured the United Kingdom.\nInternational cricket recommenced with a tour by a weakened England team in 1920–21. The strong Australian team, led by Armstrong and with a bowling attack spearheaded by Gregory and Ted McDonald won the series 5–0, the first time this was achieved in an Ashes series. Don Bradman, born in Cootamundra and raised in Bowral was 20 when he made his Test debut in the first Test of the 1928–29 series against England. He would hold the records for the highest individual Test innings and the most centuries in Test cricket and when he retired in 1948 he had the highest Test batting average, the last a record he still holds. He scored 117 first class centuries, still the only Australian to score a century of centuries and was knighted for services to cricket.\nThe Bodyline controversy began when Bradman toured England with the Australian team in 1930. Bradman scored heavily, 974 runs at an average of 139.14 including a then world record 334 at Leeds, two other double centuries and another single. Watching these displays of batting was Douglas Jardine, playing for Surrey. Following discussions with other observers such as Percy Fender and George Duckworth, he developed a tactic to limit the prodigious run scoring of Bradman and the others. The tactic, originally called fast leg theory and later called bodyline involved fast short pitched bowling directed at the batsman's body and a packed leg side field. Appointed captain of England for the 1932–33 series in Australia, Jardine was able to put these theories into practice. Combined with bowlers of the speed and accuracy of Harold Larwood and Bill Voce, the tactic required batsmen to risk injury in order to protect their wicket. In the third Test in Adelaide, Larwood struck Australian captain Bill Woodfull above the heart and fractured wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield's skull.\nIn December 1934, the Australian women's team played the English women in the first women's Test match at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground. Despite a 7 wicket haul to Anne Palmer in the first innings, the English women were too strong and won by 9 wickets.\n1945–1969.\nOnce again, war brought a stop to Shield and Test cricket as Australia mobilised for World War II. Immediately after the end of the war in Europe in 1945, an Australian Services XI played a series of Victory Tests in England. The team was captained by Lindsay Hassett and it saw the emergence of the charismatic all-rounder Keith Miller. The series was drawn 2–2. After the retirement of Bradman in 1948, Hassett, Miller and all-rounder Ray Lindwall formed the nucleus of the Australian team. They were later joined by leg spinning all-rounder, Richie Benaud and batsman Neil Harvey.\nBy the 1958–59 series, Benaud was captain of the Australian side and managed to recover the Ashes. The 1960–61 series at home against the West Indies was widely regarded as one of the most memorable. A commitment by Benaud and his West Indian counterpart Frank Worrell to entertaining cricket revived lagging interest in the sport. The gripping series, including the first tied Test, saw Australia win 2–1 and become the inaugural holders of the newly commissioned Frank Worrell Trophy. The West Indian team was held in such affection that a ticker-tape parade in their honour prior to their departure from Australia attracted a crowd of 300,000 Melburnians to wish them farewell.\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, there was an ongoing controversy regarding illegal bowling actions. A number of bowlers, Australian and international were accused of throwing or \"chucking\" over this period including the South Australian pair of Alan Hitchcox and Peter Trethewey and New South Welshman, Gordon Rorke. The controversy reached a high point when Ian Meckiff was recalled to the Australian team for the first Test of the 1963–64 series against South Africa. Called on to bowl his first over, he was no-balled 4 times by umpire Colin Egar for throwing before being removed from the attack by his skipper, Benaud. As a consequence, Meckiff retired from all levels of cricket after the match and Egar received death threats from persons aggrieved at his call.\n1970–present.\nThe 1970s saw players and administrators once again come into conflict. Poor scheduling saw Australia visit South Africa immediately after a tour to India in 1969–70. This would be the last tour to South Africa prior to the application of international sporting sanctions designed to oppose the policy of apartheid. The tired Australians came across a very strong South African team in conditions vastly different from the subcontinent, and were subsequently beaten 4–0. A request by the Australian Cricket Board for the players to play a further match in South Africa was met with resistance by the players, led by the captain, Bill Lawry.\nDuring the following home series against England, Lawry was sacked as captain and replaced by the South Australian batsman, Ian Chappell. Lawry remains the only Australian captain to be sacked in the middle of a Test series. \nGreg Chappell, Ian's younger brother, succeeded him as captain in 1975–76 and led the Australian team in the Centenary Test in Melbourne in March 1977. A celebration of 100 years of Test cricket, Australia won the Test by 45 runs, the precise result of the corresponding game 100 years earlier.\nWhile Australian cricket celebrated, the Australian media tycoon Kerry Packer was making plans to wrest away the television rights for Australian cricket. During the 1977 Ashes tour, the cricket world became aware that Packer had signed 35 of the world's top cricketers for a series of matches, including 18 Australians, 13 of whom were part of the tour party. World Series Cricket, as the breakaway group was known split Australian cricket in two for nearly three years. Former Australian captain, Bob Simpson was recalled from retirement to lead an inexperienced team in a home series against India in 1977–78, won 3–2 and then a tour to the West Indies, marred by an ugly riot. For the 1978–79 Ashes series, he was replaced by the young Victorian, Graham Yallop. The subsequent thrashing, a 5–1 victory for England, and the success of World Series Cricket forced the Australian Cricket Board to concede on Packer's terms.\nThe settlement between the ACB and WSC led to the introduction of a series of innovations including night cricket, coloured clothing and an annual limited overs tri-series called the World Series Cup. It also signalled the return of the champion cricketers Greg Chappell, Dennis Lillee and Rod Marsh. Their retirement at the end of the 1983–84 season was quickly followed by a series of tours to South Africa by a rebel Australian team in breach of the sporting sanctions imposed on the apartheid regime. The combined effect was to leave Australian cricket at its nadir under reluctant captain, Allan Border, losing Test series at home (2–1) and away (1–0) to New Zealand in 1985–86.\nThe long road back for Australian cricket started in India in 1986–87. Border, along with Bob Simpson in a new role as coach, set out to identify a group of players that a team could form around. These players showed some of the steel necessary in the famous tied Test at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. Returning to the subcontinent for the World Cup in 1987, Australia surprised the cricket world by defeating England at Eden Gardens in Kolkata to win the tournament with a disciplined brand of cricket. By the 1989 Ashes tour, the development of players such as Steve Waugh and David Boon and the discovery of Mark Taylor and Ian Healy had reaped rewards. The 4–0 drubbing of England was the first time since 1934 that Australia had recovered the Ashes away from home and marked the resurgence of Australia as a cricketing power. Australia would hold the Ashes for the next 16 years.\nThe most successful leg-spinbowler in the history of the game, Shane Warne, made his debut in 1991–92 in the third Test against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground. He had an undistinguished Test debut, taking 1/150 off 45 overs, and recording figures of 1/228 in his first Test series. From this modest beginning, Warne dominated Australian cricket for 15 years, taking 708 wickets at an average of 25.41. When the fast medium bowler, Glenn McGrath was first selected in the Australian team for the Perth test against New Zealand in 1993–94, the core of a highly successful bowling attack was formed. In 1994–95, under new captain Taylor, the Australians defeated the then dominant West Indies in the Caribbean to recover the Frank Worrell Trophy for the first time since 1978 and staked a claim to be considered the best team in the world.\nFollowing a disappointing World Cup at home in 1992, Australia then entered a run of extraordinarily successful World Cup campaigns; runners up to Sri Lanka in 1996 in the subcontinent, fighting back after early setbacks to win in England in 1999 and unbeaten on their way to another victory in South Africa. The change in captain from Taylor to Steve Waugh made little difference in the success of the Australian team. Waugh made a slightly rocky start to his term as captain, drawing 2–2 with the West Indies in the Caribbean and losing to Sri Lanka 1–0 away. A victory in the Australian team's first ever Test match against Zimbabwe was the start of an unparalleled 16 Test winning streak. The streak was finally ended in 2001 in Kolkata with a remarkable victory by India after being asked to follow-on. For Waugh, India would remain unconquered territory.\nAustralia's success was not without its detractors. Accusations of racism were made against the Australian team, one incident leading to a suspension for Darren Lehmann in 2003. Contacts between Warne and batsman Mark Waugh and illegal bookmakers, at first kept under cover by the ACB, were later revealed by the Australian press, sparking accusations of hypocrisy given Australian cricket's earlier attitude toward match fixing allegations. Warne would later be suspended from all forms of cricket for 12 months after testing positive to banned diuretics hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride. The brand of cricket played by the Australian team was praised for its spirit and aggressiveness but critics charged that this aggressive approach led to ugly sledging incidents such as the confrontation between McGrath and West Indian batsman, Ramnaresh Sarwan at the Antigua Recreation Ground in 2003. Tasmanian batsman Ricky Ponting would admit to an alcohol problem after incidents in India and in Sydney.\nA rehabilitated Ponting would succeed Waugh as captain in 2004. While injured for most of the 2004–05 series against India, his team under acting captain Adam Gilchrist defeated India in India, the first Australian series win in India since Bill Lawry's team in 1969–70. A 2–1 defeat in the 2005 Ashes series in England was quickly avenged at home with a 5–0 thrashing of England in 2006–07. The whitewash was the first in an Ashes series since Warwick Armstrong's team in 1920–21. Following the series, the successful bowling combination of McGrath and Warne retired from Test cricket, with a record that was hard to match.\nAustralia won the 2007 Cricket World Cup under Ricky Ponting in the Caribbean and were unbeaten through the tournament. Australian cricketer Matthew Hayden scored the most runs in the tournament. The finals happened to be Glenn McGrath's last match and he was also the highest wicket taker of the tournament and the player of the tournament.\nThe 2015 Cricket World Cup was jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand from 14 February to 29 March 2015. Fourteen teams played 49 matches in 14 venues, with Australia staging 26 games at grounds in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. Australia defeated New Zealand by 7 wickets to win their fifth ICC Cricket World Cup in front of a record crowd of 93,013. The winning captain Michael Clarke, retired from ODIs with immediate effect after the final match.\nAustralia also hosted the 2022 T20 World Cup from 16 October to 13 November. In total, 45 games where played across the nation, located in all capital cities except Canberra, as well as Geelong. Australia played 5 games, winning 3, losing 1 against New Zealand and having 1 abandoned. The country finished 3rd in their group, missing out on the semi-finals.\nInternational cricket.\nThe Australian national team is one of the most successful teams in international cricket. Along with England, Australia was recognised as one of the founder nations of the Imperial Cricket Conference, later the International Cricket Council. Australia generally plays a test series against a visiting team, and a one-day series between two other teams at home each summer, and tours overseas for the remainder of the year\nTest cricket.\nOn 15 March 1877, an Australian representative team played England in what would later be recognised as the first Test match. They are the most successful Test cricketing nation, with a higher percentage of won matches than any other nation.\nIn Test cricket, the Australian team compete for various trophies and championships. The ICC Test Championship is an international competition run by the ICC for the 10 teams that play Test cricket. The competition is notional in the sense that it is simply a ranking scheme overlaid on all international matches that are otherwise played as part of regular Test cricket with no other consideration whatsoever.\nThe most famous among all these trophies is The Ashes, which was played for the first time in 1882 between Australia and England. Other bilateral trophies have generally been named after the great players from the two competing nations.\nTest cricket controversy.\nIn late September 2021, Cricket Australia announced it would postpone its men's test match against Afghanistan indefinitely to prompt Afghanistan to rethink their approach to women's sports after media outlets reported that Taliban rulers would not allow women to play cricket. The match against the Afghan men's team was originally scheduled for Nov. 27 in Hobart.\nOne Day Internationals.\nThe Australian team took part in the first one day international on 5 January 1971, once again also against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Since then, the team has maintained a good record in one day internationals, winning six Cricket World Cups, more than any other national team.\nFollowing the end of World Series Cricket, from 1979 to 1980 the Australian season featured a triangular series of one day internationals, featuring the Australian team and two touring teams. The first incarnation of this tournament was called the World Series Cup and included night cricket, coloured uniforms and a white ball. In 1994–95, the tournament included an Australia A cricket team, due to the perceived weakness of the invited Zimbabwe team. For the 1996–97 season, the World Series Cup was replaced by a series of tournaments named after a major sponsor, including the Carlton &amp; United Series, the VB Series and the Commonwealth Bank Series. The successor series followed a similar format.\nAustralia and New Zealand co-hosted the 1992 Cricket World Cup, and the 2015 Cricket World Cup. In 1992, for the first time, the tournament featured the innovations already common in Australian one-day matches such as night cricket and coloured clothing. The tournament featured nine nations, expanded to include a South African team recently admitted back into world cricket. Australia despite starting firm favourites, performed poorly, failing to make the semi – final stage. Pakistan defeated England in the final in front of 87,182 spectators at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.\nThe 2015 Cricket World Cup was the 11th Cricket World Cup, jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand from 14 February to 29 March 2015. Fourteen teams played 49 matches in 14 venues, with Australia staging 26 games at grounds in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. The final match of the tournament took place at the Melbourne Cricket Ground between co-hosts New Zealand and Australia in front of a record crowd of 93,013.\nWomen's cricket.\nThere are currently 290,566 female participants in cricket. The Australia national women's cricket team competes internationally and has won the Women's Cricket World Cup 5 times, more than any other team. As in men's cricket, Australia and England were the first two women's Test nations, playing in the inaugural women's Test in Brisbane in 1934. Australia compete with England for the Women's Ashes, a cricket bat symbolically burned prior to the 1998 test series. The Australian team also compete in the Rose Bowl series, a series of one-day internationals against New Zealand.\nDomestic cricket.\nOn a domestic level, each of the six states has a cricket team which competes in two separate competitions over summer:\nMoreover, eight city-based franchises compete in the domestic Twenty20 competition known as Big Bash League. The Big Bash League replaced the previous competition, the KFC Twenty20 Big Bash in 2011.\nLocal club cricket is also popular, as well as social cricket which includes variations such as backyard and beach cricket.\nFirst Class cricket.\nThe Sheffield Shield is the domestic first-class cricket competition in Australia. It was established in 1892 using a bequest of £150 provided by Lord Sheffield for the improvement of Australian cricket and was originally named the Sheffield Shield in recognition. When established, the competition included the colonies (later states) of New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria. Queensland was admitted to the Shield competition for the 1926–27 season, Western Australia in 1947–48 and Tasmania in 1977–78.\nIn 1999, the Australian Cricket Board (now Cricket Australia) announced a 4-year sponsorship deal which included renaming the Sheffield Shield to the Pura Milk Cup, then to the Pura Cup the following season. As of the 2008–09 season, the title has reverted to its original name.\nAt the end of the 2006–07 season, all participating teams have won at least one Sheffield Shield/Pura Cup, with New South Wales the most successful state with 44 wins and Tasmania winning their first in 2006–07.\nOne Day cricket.\nThe Marsh One Day Cup is the domestic List A cricket (limited overs cricket) competition in Australia. It was established in 1969–70 and featured the state teams and a team from New Zealand. Originally a knock-out tournament, the format and name has changed several times since inception depending on the naming rights sponsor.\nNew Zealand withdrew from the competition after the 1974–75 season. The Canberra Comets, a team from the Australian Capital Territory were included for three seasons from 1997 to 1998 to 1999–2000. At the end of the 2006–07 season, Western Australia has been the most successful state with 11 wins while South Australia and Tasmania have won two each.\nIn 2013, the format changed and all matches were held in Sydney at various grounds. It was broadcast live on GEM. The whole competition was held in the month of October, prior to the Sheffield Shield.\nTwenty20 cricket.\nThe KFC Big Bash League or BBL, in short, is the Australian domestic Twenty20 cricket tournament, which was established in 2011. The Big Bash League replaced the previous competition, the KFC Twenty20 Big Bash, and features eight city-based franchises, instead of the six state-based teams which had competed before. Each state's capital city features one team, with Sydney and Melbourne featuring two.\nBBL matches are played in Australia during the summer in the months of December and January. It is now placed ninth in the list of most attended sports leagues in the world with respect to average crowd per match (2015–16 season).\nWomen's cricket.\nThe founding mother of women's cricket in Australia was the young Tasmanian, Lily Poulett-Harris, who captained the Oyster Cove team in the league she created in 1894. Lily's obituary, from her death a few years later in 1897, states that her team was almost certainly the first to be formed in the colonies. Following this, the Victoria Women's Cricket Association was founded in 1905 and the Australian Women's Cricket Association in 1931. The current competition is run by the Women's National Cricket League.\nThe first domestic women's cricket competition in Australia was the Australian Women's Cricket Championships, an annual two-week tournament established in 1930–31. The championships were replaced by the Women's National Cricket League in 1996–97. Victoria and New South Wales have been the most successful teams.\nIn 2007, the Australian Women's Twenty20 Cup was introduced, also featuring state representative teams. In 2015, it was replaced by the Women's Big Bash League, which features eight franchise teams.\nClub Cricket.\nClub cricket is popular and the first step for players looking to be selected for their state and national teams. Each state association has a peak club cricket championship variously known as 'district' or 'grade' cricket:\nInternational grounds.\nNineteen different grounds in Australia have been used for international cricket (Tests, ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals). Five were only used once, during the 1992 World Cup, while three (all in Tasmania) only hosted games during 1980s World Series Cups. The main six used are:\nOther grounds which have been used for Test cricket are:\nGrounds which have been used for One Day Internationals only are:\nGrounds in Australia which have been used exclusively for the Twenty20 Internationals:\nIn Australian culture.\nIn 2007, \"The Age\" reported that a survey by Sweeney Sports had found that 59% of the Australian public have an interest in cricket, second to none. Cricket is often known as Australia's national sport due to its equal popularity in all parts of the country. Cricket is also a mass participation sport in Australia: a census conducted on behalf of Cricket Australia found that in the 2003–04 season there were 471,329 participants in Australian cricket programmes and competitions, including 47,780 female participants.\nIn 2015–16, a record 1,300,000 Australians played formal, organised cricket during the year, an increase of nine percent over the previous year, making cricket Australia's biggest participant sport.\nThe position of Australian Test cricket captain is regarded as one of the most important roles in Australian sport. It is often said that in Australia the office of Test captain is second in stature behind the office of Prime Minister. Reflecting this community perception, three Australian cricket captains have been named as Australian of the Year by the National Australia Day Council; Allan Border in 1989, Mark Taylor in 1999 and Steve Waugh in 2004. In addition, Steve Waugh has been nominated as an Australian Living Treasure by the National Trust of Australia, as was Don Bradman prior to his death in 2001.\nCricket plays an important role in Australia's national identity, in particular its relationship towards the United Kingdom. The national team has been said to represent \"de facto Australian foreign policy\" particularly with respect to relations with Asian subcontinent nations.\nAudience.\nOfficial audience data shows that 93.6% of Australians watched at least some cricket on TV in 2010–11 calendar year.\nAustralia's victory over New Zealand in the 2015 Cricket World Cup Final was the most-watched sports match ever in Australia, peaking at 4.218 million viewers nationally. The second innings of the match, which saw Australia winning the match with seven wickets to spare, averaged 2.404 million in the five capital cities and 3.285 million nationally. A further 522,000 watched Australia's innings on pay-TV channel Fox Sports 3, while 492,000 watched the first session.\n3.196 million viewers peaked in for the 2015 Cricket World Cup semi-final between Australia and India, which was broadcast on the Nine Network.\nThe first ever Day/Night test match between Australia and New Zealand attracted nearly 3.1 million viewers across the country during the first two days of the match at Adelaide Oval. The third and eventually the final day of the match, attracted a peak national audience of 3.19 million.\nAn audience of 2.306 million viewers watched the Australia v England . It still remains the most watched Twenty20 match in Australia on TV.\nBBL games are currently broadcast in Australia by the free-to-air Seven Network and Fox Sports. In 2013, Ten paid $100 million for BBL rights over five years, marking the channel's first foray into elite cricket coverage. Network Ten had previously covered the Big Bash League.\nBBL coverage has become a regular feature of Australian summers and attracted an average audience of more than 943,000 people nationally in 2015–16 season, including a peak audience of 2.4 million viewers for the final between the Melbourne Stars and Sydney Thunder."

        "text": "James Thomas \"Jumbo\" Elliott (October 22, 1900 – January 7, 1970) was an American professional baseball player. He was a left-handed pitcher, playing in the major leagues over parts of ten seasons (1923, 1925, 1927–1934) with the St. Louis Browns, Brooklyn Robins, Philadelphia Phillies and Boston Braves. He was the National League wins leader in 1931 with Philadelphia. For his major league career, he compiled a 63–74 record in 252 appearances, with a 4.24 ERA and 453 strikeouts.\nElliott was born in St. Louis, Missouri. When he retired from baseball, he resided in Terre Haute, Indiana, the county seat of Vigo County. He first came to Terre Haute in 1922 as a pitcher for the Three-I League professional Class B minor league baseball team. Elliott was a long-time Deputy Sheriff in Vigo County and ran for Vigo County Sheriff as a Democrat in the 1968 election. His opponent was Clyde Lovellette, then retired from an extraordinary college and professional basketball career. The campaign earned national notoriety because both candidates were such big men (Elliott was approximately and ) and sports celebrities. Lovellette won the election.\nElliott died in Terre Haute at age 69."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball annual wins leaders",
        "text": "Major League Baseball recognizes the player or players in each league with the most wins each season. In baseball, wins are a statistic used to evaluate pitchers. Credit for a win is given by the official scorer to the pitcher whose team takes and maintains the lead while he is the pitcher of record. If a game is tied or if the lead changes to the other team, all pitchers who have participated and exited the game to that point are unable to receive credit for the victory. A starting pitcher is ineligible for the win if he has not completed five or more innings of the game; instead, the scorer would award the victory to the relief pitcher who was \"most effective... in the official scorer's judgment\".\nHistory.\nThe National League's first win champion was Albert Spalding, who led the senior circuit with 47 wins after leading the semi-professional National Association in each of its five seasons. Hall of Fame pitcher Cy Young led the American League in wins in each of its first three years (1901–1903), amassing 33, 32, and 28 victories in those seasons for the Boston Americans. Warren Spahn leads all players with 8 win championships for the Boston and Milwaukee Braves in his 21 seasons.\nSix titles.\nThree players have led their league in wins six times during their careers. Grover Cleveland Alexander led the National League in victories six times, with a single-season career-high 33 wins in 1916. In the American League, two pitchers have accomplished the same feat: Walter Johnson, whose 36 wins in 1913—his first season leading the league—were a single-season career high, and Bob Feller.\nFive and four titles.\nIn addition to his three American League wins, Young also led the National League twice (1892, 1895) to amass the third-highest total of win championships in major league history. Joe McGinnity and Tom Glavine also captured five wins titles in the National League. Pitchers who have led their league four times include Steve Carlton, Roger Clemens, Christy Mathewson, Hal Newhouser, and Robin Roberts.\nMost wins in a Major League season.\nCharles \"Old Hoss\" Radbourn holds the single-season record for the most games won in a major league season; he notched 59 victories in 1884. There is a discrepancy in Radbourn's victory total in 1884. The classic MacMillan Baseball Encyclopedia, as well as other sources credit Radbourn with 60 wins (against 12 losses), other sources place his win total as high as 62. He and John Clarkson (53 wins in 1885) are the only pitchers to exceed 50 wins in a single season in the current major leagues; Guy Hecker also accomplished the feat in the American Association. The American League leader is Jack Chesbro, who won 41 games for the New York Yankees in 1904; his total is the highest since Major League Baseball's consolidation in 1901. The highest total in the National League since 1901 is Mathewson's 37 victories in 1908. The largest margin of victory for the title is 21 wins, achieved by Clarkson in 1889; he won 49 games, while his closest competitors (Charlie Buffinton and Tim Keefe) won 28 each. The American League title's largest margin of victory is 16 wins—Ed Walsh notched 40 wins in 1908, followed by Addie Joss and Ed Summers with 24 victories.\nThe number of wins required to lead the league each season has gone down significantly over the last century. For example, from 1900 to 1920, the average number of wins for the AL league leader was 30.8; from 1990 to 2010, it was 20.9.\nTies.\nTies for the win championship are common. The most recent tie in the American League was in 2012, when Jered Weaver and David Price tied for the lead with 20 wins each, and the most recent tie in the National League was in 2011, when Ian Kennedy and Clayton Kershaw tied with 21 wins each. The most pitchers to share the title in a single season is six, accomplished in 2006 when Aaron Harang, Derek Lowe, Brad Penny, John Smoltz, Brandon Webb, and Carlos Zambrano each won 16 games in the National League. In the American League, four pitchers shared the award in the strike-shortened 1981 season."

        "text": "George Edward Browne (January 12, 1876 – December 9, 1920) was an American professional baseball right fielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies, New York Giants, Boston Doves, Chicago Cubs, Washington Senators, Chicago White Sox, and Brooklyn Dodgers between 1901 and 1912.\nBiography.\nBrowne was born in Richmond, Virginia. Browne entered the major leagues with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1901. Though he usually spent one or two seasons with a team, he remained with the New York Giants from 1902 to 1907. He was the National League leader in runs scored in 1904 with New York; runs were down across the league and Browne's 99 runs were the lowest total for a league leader until 1915.\nA member of the 1905 World Series champion Giants, Browne hit .227 with one RBI and two runs scored in the World Series. Moonlight Graham, whose one-inning major-league career became famous through the movie \"Field of Dreams\", replaced Browne in his lone appearance for the 1905 Giants. Browne's \"World's Champions\" jersey, which the Giants wore during the 1906 season, was exhibited at the Baseball Hall of Fame.\nAfter leaving the Giants following the 1907 season, Browne played one season with the Boston Doves and was sold to the Chicago Cubs; the Washington Senators then purchased him early in the 1909 season. He remained there until mid-1910, when he was sold to the Chicago White Sox. For his career, he compiled a .273 batting average, 303 runs batted in, 614 runs scored, and 190 stolen bases.\nIn 1920, Browne became sick with tuberculosis right as former teammate Christy Mathewson was recovering from the illness. Newspaper accounts highlighted the differences in financial capacity between the former star Mathewson and the lesser-known Browne. While Mathewson had been able to afford the best treatment, Browne's friends had to help ensure that he was admitted to a hospital in the Bronx. The New York Giants raised $1,825 for him in a benefit baseball game.\nOn December 9, 1920, Browne died of tuberculosis at his home in Hyde Park, New York, at the age of 44. He was interred at St. Peter's Cemetery in Poughkeepsie."

        "text": "The 1999 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 70th playing of the midsummer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was held on July 13, 1999, at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts, the home of the Boston Red Sox of the American League.\nFenway Park was chosen as host because the owners at the time were planning to build a New Fenway Park in a few years but were unable to get the project off the ground in time for the game. The closing of Tiger Stadium in Detroit, Michigan, along with the move of the Milwaukee Brewers to the National League and the delay in the construction of Miller Park also played a role in the Red Sox being awarded the game.\nThe pre-game ceremonies featured introductions of nominees for the All-Century Team, including longtime Red Sox outfielder Ted Williams.\nIn two innings, AL starting pitcher Pedro Martínez struck out the first four batters of the National League, becoming the first pitcher in history to begin the All-Star Game striking out the side. In all he struck out five of the six batters he faced, earning him Game MVP honors, becoming the second player in All-Star Game history to be named MVP as a member of the host team. The game resulted in a win for the American League by the final score of 4-1.\nStarting with the 1999 All-Star Game, the games would always be held either on the 2nd or 3rd Tuesday of July, from 1999 to 2017, it was held between July 9 and July 16, and on July 17 in 2018.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nGame.\nUmpires.\nThis was the last All-Star Game with umpires from separate leagues. In 2000, Major League Baseball unified the umpiring staffs under its control. Five of the umpires in this game (Evans, Tata, Ford, Johnson, and Vanover) lost their jobs less than two months later as part of the 1999 Major League Umpires Association mass resignation. However, through an arbitration process, Vanover was rehired before the 2002 season."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in India in 2000–01",
        "text": "The Australian cricket team toured India from February to April 2001 for a three-Test series and a five-match ODI series. The series is considered one of India's finest, as they secured victory against Australia in the Test series, in the process breaking Australia's 16-match win streak in Tests, and being the third side to win a Test match after being asked to follow-on during the match in Kolkata. The Kolkata match has been widely regarded as one of the greatest matches in the sport's history.\nBackground.\nThe Indian cricket team at the time was depleted, without leading leg spinner Anil Kumble. On the spinning tracks of India, this left them at a disadvantage, with the other spinners who had filled the void during the earlier part of the season being Sunil Joshi, Sarandeep Singh and Murali Kartik, all having played fewer than 10 Tests each.\nHarbhajan Singh, whose previous best Test figures were only 3/30, was entrusted with a heavy burden, having been recalled at the behest of captain Sourav Ganguly after previous instances of indiscipline. He was to lead the spin attack against an Australian team which had set a world record with 16 consecutive Test victories, and was searching for its first series victory on Indian soil since 1969. In the first Test, his spinning partner was Rahul Sanghvi, a debutant.\nTour matches.\n40-over match: India XI v Australians.\nThe match was played for the benefit of the 'Gujarat Earthquake Victims' and sponsored by Siyaram's. All the proceeds from this benefit match went to the Gujarat Relief Fund. In another noble gesture, all district associations affiliated with the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association donated ₹110,000 (US$118,721.90) to the relief fund.\nTest series.\nFirst Test.\nThe start of the First Test in Mumbai was overshadowed by the death of Sir Donald Bradman, universally regarded as the greatest batsman in cricket history. After a minute's silence, Australian captain Steve Waugh won the toss and elected to field on a pitch offering assistance to the bowling team. Ganguly stated that he would have done likewise. The Australian fast bowlers quickly removed India's top order, with both openers and Rahul Dravid removed in the first hour's play with only 31 runs scored. After Ganguly was removed with the score on 55, the Indians progressed to be 4/62 at lunch. Sachin Tendulkar lead a counterattack in the hour after lunch, scoring 53 runs in 53 balls to take the score to 4/130 before V. V. S. Laxman was removed. The innings lost momentum when Tendulkar was dismissed for 76, leaving the score at 6/139. India were eventually bowled out in the final session for 176. Shane Warne took 4/47 while Glenn McGrath managed 3/19. In reply, Australia reached 1/49 at stumps, losing Michael Slater.\nAustralia made steady progress on the second day to reach 1/71, when Harbhajan dismissed Justin Langer. Mark Waugh, the new batsman, was dismissed for a golden duck after Ganguly took a one-handed close-range diving catch from the next delivery. Sanghvi dismissed Steve Waugh, and Harbhajan removed Ricky Ponting for a duck in the following over to reduce Australia to 5/99 after the first-hour play, with Harbhajan taking a spell of 3/8. Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist joined opener Matthew Hayden at the crease, who had just reached 50. After the break, Gilchrist led a counterattack, scoring 36 from 39 balls, and Australia reached lunch at 5/170, scoring 71 runs in the second hour. The batting pace increased after lunch, with Gilchrist moving from 50 to 100 in just 29 balls. 96 runs were added in the hour after lunch and after the 197-run partnership ended in 32 overs, Gilchrist and Hayden had scored 122 and 119 respectively. Australia reached 8/329 at tea, compiling 158 runs in the session. A run a ball cameo of 39 from Warne allowed Australia to reach 349, a lead of 173. Harbhajan ended with 4/121. India's top order fared better in the second innings, managing to compile 58 before both openers were lost. they suffered a last scare when wicket-keeper Nayan Mongia, sent in as a nightwatchman was forced to retire hurt after suffering a finger injury, forcing Tendulkar to face the final over of the second day.\nIndia resumed on the third day 115 runs behind, with Tendulkar yet to score and Rahul Dravid having made only six runs from 41 deliveries. They made slow progress, with Dravid taking 41 deliveries to move from six to seven runs. Only 19 runs were scored in the first hour. A further 39 were scored in the second hour before lunch as India concentrated on preserving wickets. Tendulkar counterattacked again after lunch as he did on the first day, with India accumulating 34 runs in seven overs. This ended when a pull shot by Tendulkar from a Mark Waugh long hop hit Langer in the back, who had taken evasive action from his close catching position, and rebounded in the air to be caught by Ponting for 65. After Ganguly was run out for 1, Laxman and Dravid departed in consecutive overs, leaving India at 6/174. Dravid had occupied the crease for 196 balls in compiling 39 runs. The tail was eventually dismissed for 219, with only Mongia's 29 the only other resistance. Tendulkar was the only Indian to pass 50 in the match, and the batting display was epitomised by injured fast bowler Javagal Srinath, who attempted to bat with only one hand and was dismissed without scoring. The other notable event in the Indian innings was a mistimed pull shot from Dravid, which saw an attempted diving catch by Slater. Slater claimed the catch, but Dravid and umpire Srinivas Venkataraghavan disagreed. Slater angrily confronted both men with lengthy verbal outbursts. Australia recorded the 47 runs required for victory without losing a wicket in just seven overs, winning their 16th consecutive Test victory. Ganguly was booed off the ground, and Steve Waugh hailed an \"outstanding team performance\" by Australia. Gilchrist was named man of the match with 122 and six catches.\nSecond Test.\nWith leading paceman Javagal Srinath ruled out of the series with a finger injury during the First Test, the teams met for the Second Test in Kolkata, with an even bigger burden on Harbhajan. Public opinion was sceptical about India's chances of stopping Australia's winning streak, with former captain Bishan Bedi lamenting the demise of Indian cricket. Australia were again in control on the first day, scoring 193/1, with Hayden having struck Harbhajan out of the attack. Harbhajan fought back to reduce Australia to 252/7, taking five wickets in the final session, including Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist and Shane Warne in successive balls to become the first Indian to claim a Test hat-trick. After a prolonged wait for the third umpire to adjudicate whether Sadagoppan Ramesh had managed to catch Warne before the ball hit the ground, the near-capacity crowd at Eden Gardens erupted when he was given out. Harbhajan eventually finished with 7/123 as Australia were bowled out for 445. India batted poorly, although Laxman scored 59, and were all out for 171, trailing by 274 runs.\nAustralia enforced the follow-on, and India seemed to be all but out of the match, and the series, after McGrath got Ganguly out on 48, with India at 232/4. But then came an epic 376-run partnership between V. V. S. Laxman and Rahul Dravid. The duo batted together for an entire day, Laxman scoring 281 and Dravid scoring 180. This allowed India to declare early on the final day at 657/7, with a 383 run lead, setting Australia an imposing target of 384 to win.\nAustralia appeared to be safely batting out the match for a draw, until losing 7/56 in the final session, collapsing from 166/3 to be bowled out for 212. Tendulkar took three LBW wickets and Harbhajan claimed four of the wickets, to finish with 6/73 for the innings and a match tally of 13/196. India ended Australia's 16-match world record winning streak, and became only the third team to win a Test after being forced to follow on, with Australia having been the losing team on all three occasions.\nThird Test.\nThe teams arrived in Chennai for the deciding Third Test, and Australia's batsmen again seized control after winning the toss, reaching 340/3 on the second morning. Then, Australian captain Steve Waugh padded away a delivery from Harbhajan. The ball spun back into Waugh's stumps, who pushed the ball away with his glove, becoming only the sixth batsman in Tests to be given out \"handled the ball\". Waugh's dismissal instigated another Australian batting collapse, losing 6 wickets for 51 runs to be bowled out for 391, with Harbhajan taking all six in a spell of 6/26, to finish with 7/133. After India's batsmen gained a first-innings lead of 110, the Australian batsmen were again unable to cope with Harbhajan in the second innings, who took 8/84 to end with match figures of 15/217. India appeared to be heading for an easy victory at 101/2 chasing 155, before losing 6/50 to be 151/8. Perhaps fittingly, Harbhajan walked to the crease, and struck the winning runs.\nHe was named man of the match and man of the series, having taken 32 wickets in the series, when none of his team-mates managed more than 3. The Wisden 100 study conducted by Wisden in 2002 rated all four of Harbhajan's efforts in the Second and Third Tests in the top 100 bowling performances of all time, the most for any bowler. He paid tribute to his father, who had died just six months earlier. His performance led to him usurping Anil Kumble's position as India's first-choice spinner."

Much of the Rugby's history was lost when it was merged with its Hinckley counterpart in 1983.\nThe Hinckley Freehold Land and Permanent Building Society opened for business in November 1865, managed by Thomas Kiddle from his draper’s shop in Castle Street, Hinckley. The society changed its name to The Hinckley Permanent Building Society in 1907, still run by the family. In 1959, Geoffrey Kiddle moved on, ending the Kiddle family’s almost century-long association with the Society.\nThe Society’s first proper branch opened in 1964 in Friar Lane, Leicester, swiftly followed by further branches in South Wigston and Barlestone. A new head office was built in Upper Bond Street, Hinckley, and officially opened in 1970. The Society can still be found to this day at 37 Castle Street, a Grade II listed building dating back to the 18th century. \nIn 1979, the Society’s name changed once more to Hinckley Building Society.

        "text": "James Hill Jr. (July 22, 1928 – August 29, 2006), nicknamed \"Iron Claw\", was an American football cornerback who played for the Chicago / St. Louis Cardinals and the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL). He ended his professional career with the Kansas City Chiefs of the American Football League (AFL).\nEarly life.\nHill played football first as Booker T. Washington High School as an offensive end, where he was named to the All-Texas team in 1945 and 1946. He also excelled in track and field. He attended Sam Houston State College in Austin, Texas, excelling in football, sprint, baseball, and basketball, being named the best all-around athlete in his last three years in college.\nHe tried his hand at semi-pro football in St. Louis, Missouri in 1953, playing a few games in 1953 and 1954 before the team folded. He tried making the Cleveland Browns in 1954 but missed the cut before being signed by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1955, where he elected to switch to defense, making the team as a 27-year-old rookie.\nPro football career.\nWith Billy Stacy, Larry Wilson and Jerry Norton, Hill was an idea corner threat for the Cardinals, and Wilson cited him as a mentor during his rookie season about how to be a professional. He was named to the Pro Bowl in three straight seasons from 1960 to 1962, owing to his status as a shut-down corner, which resulted in four interceptions in 1961 and two in 1962. Hill was cited by numerous players and coaches as an efficient corner, with Del Shofner calling him \"inhuman\" and his backfield coach Ray Willsey calling him one of the best of the league, and Hill did not allow a touchdown pass from 1960 to 1962.\nHill's career highlights were overshadowed by his performance in a game on October 20, 1963, against the Green Bay Packers. When making a tackle on quarterback Bart Starr on the sideline, Starr kicked Hill in the mouth only for Hill to follow with a punch to the face of Starr. He was assessed a 15-yard penalty and ejection; Hill lost two teeth on the kick while Starr broke a bone in his throwing hand and missed four games while neither was suspended. Hill apologized to Starr after the game, which Starr forgave, but \"Sports Illustrated\" covered the story a few weeks later and portrayed the moment as a negative one for Hill, with journalist Walter Bingham calling it \"the most reprehensible play of the season\" (either by ignoring or not knowing of Hill's apology). Hill was booed by the St. Louis crowd after the story broke out, and he was quoted as saying that it hurt him deeply to the point where he did not want to be introduced with the other starters before games. He retired briefly after the 1964 season but returned to do stints with the Lions and Chiefs in 1965 and 1966, with the latter tenure of three games earning him a championship (although he did not play in the postseason run for the Chiefs). Years later, Hill was cited by \"The Arizona Republic\" as the 98th best player in Cardinals history.\nPersonal life.\nAfter retirement, Hill stayed in St. Louis while operating music stores and various bars and restaurants in the area and serving as a part-time scout for the Chiefs. Hill died at the age of 78 in 2006."

The list contains the home stadiums of all 32 professional teams playing in the NFL as well as the largest stadiums used by college football teams in the NCAA. The largest stadium used by a professional team falls at number 15 on the list. Not included are several large stadiums used by teams in the now-defunct NFL Europa, as these were all built for and used mainly for association football, or Rogers Centre, located in Canada (although it does host occasional American football games). Currently American football stadiums with a capacity of 25,000 or more are included.\nStadiums are ordered by seating capacity. This is intended to represent the permanent fixed seating capacity, when the stadium is configured for football. Some stadiums can accommodate larger crowds when configured for other sports, or by using temporary seating or allowing standing-room only attendance."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball annual strikeout leaders",
        "text": "In baseball, the strikeout is a statistic used to evaluate pitchers. A pitcher earns a strikeout when he puts out the batter he is facing by throwing a ball through the strike zone, \"defined as that area over homeplate \"(sic)\" the upper limit of which is a horizontal line at the midpoint between the top of the shoulders and the top of the uniform pants, and the lower level is a line at the hollow beneath the kneecap\", which is not put in play. Strikeouts are awarded in four situations: if the batter is put out on a third strike caught by the catcher (to \"strike out swinging\" or \"strike out looking\"); if the pitcher throws a third strike which is not caught with fewer than two outs; if the batter becomes a baserunner on an uncaught third strike; or if the batter bunts the ball into foul territory with two strikes.\nMajor League Baseball recognizes the player or players in each league with the most strikeouts each season. Jim Devlin led the National League in its inaugural season of 1876; he threw 122 strikeouts for the Louisville Grays. The American League's first winner was Hall of Fame pitcher Cy Young, who captured the American League Triple Crown in 1901 by striking out 158 batters, along with leading the league in wins and earned run average. Walter Johnson led the American League in strikeouts twelve times during his Hall of Fame career, most among all players. He is followed by Nolan Ryan, who captured eleven titles between both leagues (nine in the American League and two in the National League). Randy Johnson won nine strikeout titles, five coming with the Arizona Diamondbacks. Three players have won seven strikeout championships: Dazzy Vance, who leads the National League; Bob Feller; and Lefty Grove. Grover Cleveland Alexander and Rube Waddell led their league six times, and five-time winners include Steve Carlton, Roger Clemens, Sam McDowell, Christy Mathewson, Amos Rusie, and Tom Seaver.\nThere are several players with a claim to the single-season strikeout record. Among recognized major leagues, Matt Kilroy accumulated the highest single-season total, with 513 strikeouts for the Baltimore Orioles of the American Association in 1886. However, his name does not appear on Major League Baseball's single-season leaders list, since the American Association was independent of the constituent leagues that currently make up Major League Baseball. Several other players with high totals, including 1886 American Association runner-up Toad Ramsey (499) and 1884 Union Association leader Hugh Daily (483), do not appear either. In the National League, Charles \"Old Hoss\" Radbourn struck out 441 batters for the Providence Grays; however, the Providence franchise folded after the 1885 season and has no successor. Therefore, Major League Baseball recognizes his runner-up from that season, Charlie Buffinton, as the record-holder with 417 strikeouts. In the American League, Ryan leads with 383 strikeouts in 1973. The largest margin of victory for a champion is 156 strikeouts, achieved in 1883 when Tim Keefe of the American Association's New York Metropolitans posted 359 against Bobby Mathews' 203. The National League's largest margin was achieved in 1999, when Randy Johnson struck out 143 more batters than Kevin Brown. Ryan's 1973 margin of 125 strikeouts over Bert Blyleven is the best American League victory. Although ties for the championship are rare, they have occurred; Claude Passeau and Bucky Walters each struck out 137 National League batters in 1939, and Tex Hughson and Bobo Newsom tied in the American League with 113 strikeouts each in 1942. Their total is the lowest number of strikeouts accumulated to lead a league in Major League Baseball history (although Jacob deGrom only struck out 104 National League batters in 2020, the season was shortened by a pandemic to 60 game, or 37.04% of a regular season; had that season run a full 162 games, that would have been a net of 281 strikeouts)."

In his debut April 19 against the eventual 1955 world champion Brooklyn Dodgers, Owens was effective for his first five innings pitched, allowing only two runs to the powerful Dodgers. But in the sixth, after a 36-minute rain delay, Owens surrendered home runs to Carl Furillo and Roy Campanella and was chased from the mound with the Phillies trailing, 5–0. Five days later, starting against 1955's cellar-dwellers, the Pittsburgh Pirates, he lasted only 1 innings before, struggling with his control, he was removed from the game. Philadelphia lost the game 6–1 and Owens absorbed his second straight loss. Owens was sent back to the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs, where he had another banner year, winning 15 games before his recall in September 1955.\nThe 1956 season began in similar fashion, as Owens was treated harshly in two early-season starts (against the Pirates and the Cincinnati Redlegs). He worked in ten MLB games that year (five in relief), and got into 15 games at Triple-A. He was winless in four decisions for the 1956 Phillies, and his record in his first two years in the National League was poor: 0–6, with an earned run average of 7.51.\nOne stellar season for the Phillies.\nOwens then spent all of 1957, and all but one game in 1958, in military service. In his one game pitched in 1958, on September 23 against the pennant-bound Milwaukee Braves, he hurled seven strong innings for the win, allowing two earned runs.\nHis best season was 1959: to complement a solid ERA of 3.21, Owens went 12–12 for a last-place team, with 11 complete games and 135 strikeouts in 221 innings of work. But in 1960, he went 4–14 (5.04) and in 1961 his record was 5–10 (4.47). The Phillies finished in the NL basement each season, and Owens received notoriety for his off-field carousing as a member (with fellow pitchers Turk Farrell, Jack Meyer and Seth Morehead) of the \"Dalton Gang,\" a group of hard-drinking players in frequent conflict with the Phillies' management. After Owens' poor 1962 season—a 2–4 record with a 6.33 ERA—the Phillies traded him to Cincinnati for second baseman Cookie Rojas.\nHe was used almost entirely as a reliever in a partial season with the 1963 Reds. On April 21 of that year, he set a National League record by balking three times in one inning. (Bob Shaw broke that record less than a month later when he balked five times in one frame.) Overall, Owens posted an ERA of 5.31 in 19 games that year, including three starting assignments. He was sent to Triple-A San Diego, where he appeared in eight games. Then, in December, the Astros (then nicknamed the \"Colt .45s\") took him in the 1963 Rule 5 draft.\nReliever and coach for the Astros.\nOwens spent the final four seasons of his career with the Astros, reunited with Farrell until May 8, 1967, when Farrell was traded. Owens was used almost entirely as a reliever for Houston, pitching in a total of 148 games and starting only 11 (all in 1964). Owens led the team in relief appearances in 1965 with 50. He played his final big league game on June 20, 1967.\nEighteen days later, on July 8, Owens retired from the field to become the Astros' pitching coach, succeeding the fired Gordon Jones. He held that job through the end of the 1972 season, working with hurlers such as Mike Cuellar, Larry Dierker and Don Wilson.\nOverall, Owens' pitching record was 42–68 with a 4.31 ERA. Of the 286 games he appeared in, he started 103 of them, completing 21 of the starts and tossing one shutout. In 885 innings, he gave up 84 home runs, walked 340 batters and struck out 516.\nIn 218 at-bats, Owens collected only 22 hits for a .101 batting average and struck out 102 times. He had a .954 fielding percentage."

        "title": "David West (baseball)",
        "text": "David Lee West (September 1, 1964May 14, 2022) was an American professional baseball pitcher who played ten seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for the New York Mets, Minnesota Twins, Philadelphia Phillies, and Boston Red Sox from 1988 to 1998. He also played one season in Nippon Professional Baseball for the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks in 1997.\nEarly life.\nWest was born in Memphis, Tennessee, on September 1, 1964. He attended Craigmont High School in his hometown, where he pitched for the school's baseball team. After his graduation in 1983, the New York Mets selected him in the fourth round of the 1983 MLB draft.\nProfessional career.\nWest played six seasons in the minor leagues from 1983 to 1988, and was regarded as the Mets' premier pitching prospect. He made his MLB debut for the franchise on September 24, 1988, at the age of 24, pitching five innings, striking out three, and being the winning pitcher in a 14–1 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. After posting a 7.40 earned run average (ERA) in 21 games pitched (7 starts) midway through his 1989 rookie season, he was traded to the Minnesota Twins with Rick Aguilera, Tim Drummond, and Kevin Tapani for Frank Viola on July 31 that year.\nWest compiled a 7–9 win–loss record along with a 5.10 ERA and 92 strikeouts over a career-high innings in 1990, which ended with a hamstring injury. During spring training the following season, he injured his elbow before straining his abdominal muscles immediately ahead of his intended comeback. This consequently delayed his first start of the 1991 season to July 4. He was utilized mostly as a relief pitcher towards the end of the regular season. In the 1991 American League Championship Series, he appeared in two games against the Toronto Blue Jays, pitching innings while allowing just one hit and no runs and being the winning pitcher in Game 5. He then appeared in two games during the World Series that year but recorded no outs, allowing two hits, four runs, four walks in six total batters, resulting in an infinite ERA. The Twins ultimately won the championship in seven games.\nDuring the 1992 season, West was limited to 9 games (3 starts) and had a 1–3 record with a 6.99 ERA in innings pitched. He was traded at the end of the year to the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for Mike Hartley. He was used exclusively in relief in 1993, recording a career-best 2.92 ERA that year and finishing second in the National League (NL) in games pitched (76). The 76 games he pitched in set a Phillies record for a lefty. He went on to pitch three games in the 1993 World Series, which the Phillies lost to the Toronto Blue Jays. In the 1994 season, West finished fourth in the NL in walks (61) and wild pitches (9), and seventh in losses (10). He missed the majority of the 1996 season due to injury, before moving to Japan the following year to pitch for the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks. He returned to MLB in 1998, pitching six games for the Boston Red Sox and playing his final major league game on September 4 that year, at the age of 34.\nPersonal life.\nWest died on May 14, 2022. He was 57, and suffered from brain cancer prior to his death. He was the sixth former Phillies player to die of brain cancer since 2003, after Ken Brett, Tug McGraw, Johnny Oates, John Vukovich, and Darren Daulton. A moment of silence was put in place during the game between the Phillies and the Padres on May 17, 2022."

        "title": "Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games",
        "text": " is a 2007 crossover sports and party game developed by the Sega Sports R&amp;D Department. It is the first installment on the \"Mario &amp; Sonic\" series. It was published by Nintendo in Japan and by Sega in other regions, and released on the Wii in November 2007 and the Nintendo DS handheld in January 2008. The first official video game of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, it is licensed by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) through exclusive licensee International Sports Multimedia (ISM), and is the first official crossover game to feature characters from both the \"Mario\" and \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series.\n\"Mario &amp; Sonic\" on the Wii and DS is a collection of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. Players assume the role of a Nintendo or Sega character, using the Wii Remote to mimic sports actions such as swinging a paddle. The DS version uses the stylus and button controls. Both games follow rules and regulations of the specific sports. Sega adopted the IOC's mission of promoting sportsmanship and interest young people in the Olympics by using its characters; following this theme, Nintendo allowed Sega to include Mario with Sonic the Hedgehog, created by Sega as a mascot to rival Mario in the early 1990s.\nCritics praised the multiplayer interaction of the Wii game, and variety of events of both versions, but criticized the Wii version for its complexity and its DS counterpart for not offering the same interaction between players. The Wii game was awarded the \"Best Wii game of 2007\" at the Games Convention in Leipzig. \"Mario &amp; Sonic\" sold over 10 million units and started a series of related sport video games to coincide with upcoming Olympic events.\nGameplay.\n\"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games\" is a collection of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. On the Wii, the events consist of using the motion sensor capabilities of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk attachment to control the actions of the on-screen character. The player moves the remote in a manner similar to the method the separate games are played in real life; for example, swinging the Wii Remote to replicate hammer throw or pulling back the remote and tilting the Nunchuk like a bow and arrow. While the Nunchuk is required for archery, it is optional for most of the events. There are also events that are more physically demanding, such as the five running events which require rapid drumming of the controller. Some aspects of the gameplay are computer controlled. For example, in table tennis the player movement is controlled by the Wii, while the swinging of the racket is controlled by the player. The DS game is the same in design, but due to lack of motion controls, its events are much less physically demanding than those on the Wii. For example, instead of drumming the controller, players have to quickly stroke the touchscreen.\n\"Mario &amp; Sonic\" brings together the two title characters and fourteen more from both franchises to participate in environments based on the official venues of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. These environments are stylized to fit the futuristic and cartoon-like art styles of the \"Sonic\" and \"Mario\" franchises respectively. Each playable character has his or her own statistics which can serve as an advantage or disadvantage depending on the event. The characters are divided into four categories: all-around, speed, power, and skill. The Wii version has additional in-game characters taken from the console's Mii Channel, which allows the user to create a Mii, a customized avatar, that can be imported into games that support the feature. Both games have non-playable characters who serve as referees for particular events.\nBoth versions of \"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games\" have three similar modes of gameplay: Circuit mode, Single Match, and Mission mode. Circuit mode is where players compete for the highest overall score in a pre-determined series of events or design their own circuit. In the Single Match, players can choose to compete in each event individually. Mission mode is a single-player option where each of the competitors has six character-specific missions to complete, although the characters' statistics are not as balanced as in the main game, making missions more difficult. The Wii version's Circuit and Single Match can have an additional one to three players competing simultaneously while its DS counterpart has an extra option dedicated to multiplayer called Versus Play. Versus supports up to four people to use the wireless capabilities of the Nintendo DS to play events. DS Download Play is possible for those without an individual copy of the game, however the number of sports available is limited to six events and circuit mode is not available.\nBoth versions feature a gallery mode where brief facts about the Olympics can be found. There are five categories of Olympics-related trivia organized by history and athletes, with corresponding minigames that will unlock the answer to trivia questions once completed. Classic music from both series is available in the gallery once all levels in a category are cleared. The two versions also have leaderboards that uses the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to display the best times and scores in each event.\nEvents.\n\"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games\" features authentic Olympic events for the single match and circuit modes. The events closely follow rules and regulations of the specific sports. The types of Wii events are classified as athletics, gymnastics, shooting, archery, rowing, aquatics, fencing, and table tennis. Similar events have varying gameplay aspects; for example, getting a starting boost in the is more important than in the longer races, since the initial short burst of greater speed would play less of a role in winning the longer distance runs. In relay events, such as the relay and aquatics relay, players can assemble teams comprising any four characters.\nBesides these regular events, there are alternate versions of Olympic events called \"Dream Events\". Unlike the regular events, the gameplay in Dream Events is exaggerated. Taking place in locations and using objects from older games of the \"Mario\" and \"Sonic\" series, Dream Events allow players to use the special abilities of characters and display dramatic moments in slow motion.\nAlthough the Wii and DS versions of the game feature mostly the same events, each version has events that are not found in the other. For example, the DS version has 10 m Platform Diving, cycling, and five Dream Events—canoeing, boxing, basketball, long jump, and skeet shooting—not featured on the Wii version.\nDevelopment.\nAfter Sega transitioned from hardware to third-party development in 2001, Nintendo and Sega developed a closer relationship and worked together on \"F-Zero GX\"—the first significant video game collaboration between the two. The idea for a crossover game between Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog and Nintendo's Mario characters had been casually discussed between the two companies; Sonic Team leader Yuji Naka and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, respectively, had their private discussions revealed in 2005. Sonic the Hedgehog is the protagonist of the video game series released by Sega in order to provide the company with a mascot to rival Nintendo's flagship character Mario in the early 1990s. Despite the discussions, the idea was not acted on as it lacked a setting that would give the game \"an exclamation mark\". The idea of an Olympic setting for the mascots originated after Sega was awarded the Beijing 2008 Olympic license approximately a year later. The developer adopted the IOC's mission to promote a sporting spirit and wanted to interest young people in the Olympics with its newly acquired license. The corporation decided to base the sports game around its characters that \"young people love and are very iconic\" instead of creating a more realistic simulation. Sega then requested Nintendo for permission to include Mario in the game, setting up the first matchup between their mascots. Nintendo approved and partnered with Sega in-house to add another layer of quality control to the development. Both companies felt that the competitive sportsmanship of the Olympic Games provided an ideal choice as a setting for the once-rival mascots.\n\"Mario &amp; Sonic\" was officially announced with a joint press release by Sega and Nintendo on March 28, 2007 and premiered at E3 2007. In another showing of the collaboration between the two companies, the game was predominantly developed by the Sega Sports R&amp;D Department of Sega Japan under the supervision of Shigeru Miyamoto. He served as senior producer. Sega's Osamu Ohashi and Nintendo's Hiroshi Sato served as producers, Sega's Eigo Kasahara as director, and Teruhiko Nakagawa as composer. Racjin and according to gaming site IGN, TOSE, a developer known to avoid crediting itself in its works, helped to develop \"Mario &amp; Sonic\". The game is officially licensed by the IOC through exclusive licensee ISM and is the first official video game of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. The president of Sega Europe stated that they originally planned a number of events, including judo, to fully epitomize the Olympics. However, the figure for the final product was reduced and judo was omitted. The development of the game was swifter than planned; in October 2007, Sega announced that \"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games\" scheduled release date for the Wii has been advanced by two weeks and the game had gone gold.&lt;ref name=\"gold/events\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in 2007 in North America on November 6, in Japan on November 22, in Australia and in Europe on November 23, and in Korea on May 29, 2008. The DS version followed in 2008 in Japan on January 17, in North America on January 22, in Australia on February 7, in Europe on February 8, and in South Korea on June 26. Both versions were published by Nintendo for Japan (where it is known as ) and by Sega for North America, Europe and all other regions.\nReception.\nSales.\n\"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games\" was a commercial success; in the first few months after its release, the game was on four separate occasions the top-selling game in the United Kingdom all-formats chart. It accumulated seven weeks as the number-one seller, including the first two weeks after its release. The Wii version sold a half-million units in the UK during those seven weeks. By June 2008, both Wii and DS versions reached combined sales of 1.2 million copies in the UK, prompting Sega to create plans on re-marketing the game there. The game went on to sell over two million units combined in the country. According to the NPD Group, the Wii game was one of the top-ten best-sellers for the month of December 2007 in the United States, selling 613,000 units. Electronic Entertainment Design and Research analyst Jesse Divnich argued the game is a fitting example of brand awareness' role in determining Wii game sales. The Wii is an exception to the correlation that higher quality games lead to better sales as seen on the Xbox 360 and Sony's PlayStation 3. Divnich added \"To the casual and social gamer, it didn't matter that the game received sub-70 Metacritic scores,\" the recognizable \"Mario\" and \"Sonic\" brand names participating in a recognizable action, \"The Olympic Games,\" contributed to the game's US sales.\nAs of December 28, 2008, 594,157 units of the Wii version and as of December 27, 2009, 383,655 copies of the Nintendo DS version has been sold in Japan. The Nintendo DS version is the twenty-seventh best-selling game of Japan for 2008. In the same year for Australia, it is the eighth best-selling game while the Wii version is number four. In July 2008, Simon Jeffrey, president of Sega of America, announced that Sega has sold approximately 10 million units worldwide combined of \"Mario &amp; Sonic\" and showed interest in again collaborating with Nintendo to produce another game featuring the two companies' mascots. The game is listed in the \"Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2010\" book as the \"Best-selling gaming character cross-over\" with 7.09 million on Wii and 4.22 million copies on DS sold.\nCritical response.\nAlthough the Wii version of \"Mario and Sonic\" was awarded the \"Best Wii game of 2007\" at the Games Convention in Leipzig, it received mixed reactions from game critics; the DS version had a similar reception. A common complaint was that Sega and Nintendo failed to set the first matchup between their mascots in the genre that made them famous—platform games. Instead, the two companies threw Mario and Sonic into an Olympic-themed party video game, a move which Tae Kim of \"GamePro\" criticized as \"a marketing tool\" to popularize the XXIX Olympic Games. Although the Wii version of the game was praised for being an entertaining multiplayer experience, it was criticized for shallow gameplay and complex rules and instructions. GameTrailers concluded that \"Mario &amp; Sonic's\" lack of \"polish and simplicity\" leaves the improbable grouping of mascots as its main attraction when compared to other party video games released for the platform.\nGameSpot's Aaron Thomas rated the Wii version's motion control scheme as \"uninteresting and occasionally frustrating\". X-Play's Morgan Webb agreed, calling the controls \"non-intuitive\" and commenting that the minigames required players to \"wave their Wiimotes frantically while pressing several buttons at the same time\". Dan Hsu of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" mentioned that the controls were complicated for a game that should be a \"pure pick-up-and-play party game\". Tae Kim said the events were \"short and fairly shallow\" and mostly required players to move the \"Wii Remote and Nunchuks in specific ways—rapidly up and down for running events, for example\". Mark Bozon of \"IGN\" called \"Mario &amp; Sonic\" a success due to the entertainment value derived from the slight variety of competitions offered in the game. However, he and several other critics felt that events within the same classification were similar; Bozon noted that diversity was lacking as \"five or six [events felt] nearly identical\", and Thomas found the gameplay of several events to be overly similar to one another despite the reviewer praising the game for its number of events. Both reviewers favored the more complex objectives found in the fantasy events of the game, which shared attributes with that of the Mario sport games and archery.\nOn the Nintendo DS, \"Mario &amp; Sonic\" was regarded as virtually the same game in design as its Wii counterpart; however, opinions on its control scheme varied greatly. GameSpy's Gerald Villoria thought the tradeoffs between both versions made them equally enjoyable. Andrew Fitch of 1UP.com assured readers in his review that the less physically demanding gameplay of the DS version made the game accessible for extended periods of time. Fitch further stated that in nearly \"every case, events [were] far more enjoyable on the DS\" due to the requirement of the human body's finer motor skill abilities to control the characters. However, Eurogamer's Ellie Gibson noted that the lack of physical demand reduced the players' engrossment with the game. Craig Harris of \"IGN\" had a similar opinion, stating, \"Rapidly drumming the controllers is far more challenging than quickly stroking the touchscreen.\" Harris felt the DS version lost some relevance to its marginally superior Wii counterpart since had a similar design and released almost three months afterwards.\nMost publications agreed that the Wii counterpart of \"Mario &amp; Sonic\" had clean textures and well-done animations; N-Europe's Iun Hockley thought that each character was pleasingly rendered, and Thomas added that the graphics were \"crisp and colorful\". Mark Bozon preferred the remixed Nintendo and Sega music and thought the general Olympic-related music \"[could] be a bit generic\". GameDaily's Robert Workman called the background music \"mostly forgettable\". Echoing this sentiment for the DS version, Emily Balistrieri of \"GamePro\" thought \"most of the music [wasn't] too interesting\". Compared to the Wii version, the DS version's visuals are of the same style and its graphics are nearly on the same level. Due to the inability to compete against other players online, Harris regarded \"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games\" limited use of the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection on the DS as a \"missed opportunity\". Many reviewers, including Gibson and Pro-G's James Orry, found the uploading of best times and scores to be a cumbersome process. Although the home console version also has online rankings, it lacks direct competition between players. Disappointed with the aforementioned aspect, Bozon rationalized that the leaderboards \"certainly [made] sense for a game like this\".\nLegacy.\n\"Sonic at the Olympic Games\" is a Sonic-themed sports game for mobile phones released in June 2008. Developed by AirPlay and published by Sega, the game features five events based on the Olympic Games starring Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Amy. Players control one character from a two-dimensional perspective through one-button commands. The commercial success of \"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games\" started a series of \"Mario &amp; Sonic\" sport video games to coincide with upcoming Summer and Winter Olympic Games. Titles such as \"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games\", based on the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and released on the Wii and the Nintendo DS in October 2009, sold 6.53 million copies in the US and Europe by March 31, 2010, while \"Mario &amp; Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games\", based on the 2012 Summer Olympics and released on the Wii in November 2011 and the Nintendo 3DS in February 2012, sold 3.28 million copies in the US and Europe by March 31, 2012. Sean Ratcliffe, vice president of marketing at Sega of America said, \"I think the key factor that decides the ongoing building of this franchise is basically success. Is the game successful? Are consumers happy with it?\""

        "title": "Streamline (swimming)",
        "text": "Streamline form is a swimming technique that is used underwater in every stroke. At the start of a race or on a turn, streamline form is used, usually along with a dolphin kick or flutter kick, to create the least amount of resistance to help the swimmer propel as far as they can. Many factors contribute to the perfect streamline form and mastering this method increases a swimmer's speed. Streamline is one of the key fundamentals to mastering any stroke.\nTechnique.\nThe streamline position consists of a person placing hand over hand, fingers over fingers and raising their arms above their head so the biceps are tucked close to the ears. The belly is sucked back to decrease curvature of the spine in the lower back and the swimmer's head is brought back to ensure that neck is in line with the spine Pinching the shoulder blades together is helpful in aligning the spine to straighten out the back. Legs are straight and feet are pointed. In theory, a perfect, straight line will be made down the backside of a swimmer from their head to their feet. The body should be on a horizontal plane under the water, with the legs kicking straight from the thighs and hips, not the knees. A great deal of flexibility is usually needed to reach the goal of a perfect streamline, particularly flexibility of the shoulders. Kicking in the streamline position underwater can be substantially faster than swimming any of the other aquatic strokes, competitive or otherwise. For this reason, competitive swimmers often try to kick in a streamline position off a wall or the starting block for as long as they can be underwater before coming up for their first stroke. This is why many swimmers spend a lot of time perfecting the form and technique of streamline.\nHydrodynamics and Speed.\nThere are three main resistances caused by drag on a swimmer which are caused from friction, form, and wave-making forces. The most detrimental force to streamline would be the resistance caused by form. Bad form will cause more drag on a body in water (resistance) resulting in more work needing to be done to cover the same amount of distance. The amount of resistance on an object can be determined by the formula,\nD is the constant for the viscosity of the fluid, p is the density of the water, A is the surface area of the body traveling through the water, and v is the velocity of the body.\nBecause the velocity is squared, the resistance will be exponentially affected by the value of velocity, which is why it is important to minimize the surface area as much as possible. Minimizing surface area is directly proportional to technique. Timing in the transition from the glide to the kick is crucial for a swimmer to keep up their momentum. Switching to the kick too early will cause an increase in resistance. A transition that is performed too late will result in loss of speed due to the decrease in momentum, resulting in a waste of energy while returning to race speed. With all aspects of streamline brought together, it makes it the most hydrodynamic position one can assume in the water.\nCompetition and Rules.\nStreamline position is mostly used at the start of the race once a swimmer dives into the water off of the blocks. It is most common for the swimmer to dive into the water head first with their arms above their head and assume the streamline form at entry. The other common occurrence of streamline in a competitive race is after a swimmer completes a flip turn and pushes off of the wall. Once they have completely turned over to the opposing direction, the swimmer will then get into streamline position and push off of the wall to maximize the distance and speed out of the turn. Streamline position is the basis of the spinal axis strokes, backstroke and freestyle, as well. A swimmer will try to maintain a straight back and legs to minimize 'drag' during the stroke.\nThe Fédération Internationale de Natation (F.I.N.A.), otherwise known as the International Swimming Federation, has strict rules on how and when streamline may be performed in competition. According to FINA, no swimmer may travel more than 15 meters (16.4 yards) off of a start or turn in the backstroke, butterfly and freestyle underwater. Breaststroke is only allowed one complete arm stroke followed by a butterfly kick and breaststroke kick. After fifteen meters, the swimmer must break the surface of the water. This rule applies to all races done in compliance with FINA rules whether it is short course or long course. Swimmers in a race will usually maintain the streamline form and perform a butterfly kick for the full fifteen meters due to the fact that there is less resistance than there is on top of the water due to the lack of drag created by waves. \nThere is no specified limit in this stroke, but, since the number of underwater strokes and kicks are regulated, this becomes a moot point to competitive swimming. It is not hydrodynamic to maintain this position past a certain distance, which is invariably less than the length of a short-course pool."

        "title": "AMA Motocross Championship",
        "text": "The AMA Motocross Championship (commercially known as Pro Motocross Championship) is an American motorcycle racing series. The motocross race series was founded and sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) in 1972. The series is the major outdoor motocross series in the United States and is sanctioned by AMA Pro Racing and managed by MX Sports Pro Racing.\nWith respect to the MXGP holding the discipline's worldwide title, and the advent of the FIM Supercross World Championship resulting in the AMA Supercross Championship losing its world title status, the two series will form the SuperMotocross World Championship from 2023.\nSeries history.\nThe series began in 1972 with the introduction of two classes based on 500 cc and 250 cc engine displacement formulas. A 125 cc class was added in 1974. As motocross technology developed, 500 cc two-stroke motocross bikes became too powerful for the average rider and, faced with diminishing numbers of competitors, the AMA discontinued the 500 cc class after the 1993 season. A women's national championship series was introduced in 1996.\nFacing tightening federal emissions regulations in the United States, the A.M.A. increased the allowable displacement capacity for four-stroke engines in 1997, in an effort to encourage manufacturers to develop environmentally friendlier four-stroke machines. Due to the low relative power output of four-stroke engines, compared to the then-dominating two stroke design, the AMA had increased the allowable displacement capacity for four-strokes. By 1994, the displacement limit of a four-stroke power motocross bike was up to 550 cc in the 250 class, to incentivize manufactures to further develop the design for use in motocross.\nIn 2006, the 250 cc division was renamed the MX Class, with an engine formula allowing for 150–250 cc two-stroke or 250–450 cc four-stroke machines. The 125 cc class was renamed the MX Lites Class, allowing 0–125 cc two-stroke or 150–250 cc four-stroke engines. In 2009, the MX class was renamed the 450MX Class and the MX Lites Class was renamed the 250MX Class, to reflect the fact that all the competing manufacturers had adopted four-stroke machinery.\nNational champions.\nReferences:\nMost wins by rider.\nSource:\nTelevision coverage.\nCurrent.\nIn 2023, there are three broadcast partners from the NBC family of networks: NBC, USA and Peacock.\n\"Source:\"\nAMA Supercross.\nIn the 1970s promoters such as Bill France started bringing motocross races in from the country to stadiums within cities. Instead of being built upon natural terrain, dirt was imported into the stadiums where promoters tried to emulate the motocross tracks. In 1972 Mike Goodwin and Terry Tiernan, the president of the AMA, put on one of these stadium races in the Los Angeles Coliseum. The race was dubbed as the Super Bowl of Motocross. Eventually this form of racing evolved into its own sport and series with the name Supercross which was a shortening of the original \"Super Bowl of Motocross\". American motocross racing distinguished itself from European motocross by having two different season championships run each year for each class both sanctioned by the AMA. Currently the AMA runs their 17-round Supercross championship from the first weekend in January to the first weekend in May and then the 11-round outdoor Motocross championship from mid-May through late August.\nWhereas AMA Motocross is two 30-minute plus 2 lap per each round with the winner being the rider with the highest combined points total for the two motos, in Supercross there is only one points-paying race per round. Around 40 riders qualify for each Supercross round. Heat races and LCQs are used to bring the field down to 22 riders for a points-paying main event for each round. A main event is 20 minutes plus 1 lap for the 450 class and 15 minutes plus 1 lap for the 250 class. There is no 250 Supercross national champion like there is for motocross. The 250 class in Supercross is split into East and West divisional rounds with an All Star race combining the top riders of each division at the final round in Las Vegas."

        "text": "The Monuments are five classic cycle races generally considered to be the oldest, hardest, longest and most prestigious one-day events in men's road cycling, with distances between 240 and 300 km.\nThey each have a long history and specific individual characteristics. They are currently the one-day races in which most points can be earned in the UCI World Tour and the only 3rd categorized UCI races, only behind Grand Tour races; Tour de France (1st category) and Giro and Vuelta (both 2nd category).\nEddy Merckx is by far the most successful monument rider with 19 wins in total. He is the only cyclist in history to win three monuments in one season, a feat he achieved in 1969, 1971, 1972 and 1975.\nOrigin.\nOn 17 April 1949, at the day of 47th Paris–Roubaix race edition, the term \"monument\" appeared for the first time in road cycling sport. French sports journalist Albert Baker d'Isy, specialised in cycling, published an article titled \"Paris–Roubaix: \"monument\" du cyclisme\" in the French newspaper Ce soir.\nList of monuments.\nThe five monuments are:\nStatistics.\nMost monuments wins.\nOnly three riders have won all five monument races during their careers: Rik Van Looy, Eddy Merckx and Roger De Vlaeminck, all three Belgians, and only Eddy Merckx won each of them more than once. \nSix riders won four different monuments. With multiple victories in all the other monuments, Sean Kelly almost joined the top group, finishing second in the Tour of Flanders on three occasions (1984, 1986 and 1987). Kelly is the only other rider, after Merckx, to win four different monuments on multiple occasions.\nDutch rider Hennie Kuiper won each monument except Liège–Bastogne–Liège, in which he finished second in 1980. Frenchman Louison Bobet also won all but Liège–Bastogne–Liège. Belgian rider Fred De Bruyne came close as well, finishing second in the Giro di Lombardia in 1955 and winning the other four races during his career. Germain Derycke also won four, all except the Giro di Lombardia. Philippe Gilbert is the most recent rider to win four different monuments, all except Milan–San Remo, in which he finished third twice. \n23 riders have won at least five monuments in their career.\nEddy Merckx also holds the record of most victories in a single Monument, winning Milan-San Remo seven times.\nRiders in blue are still active. Riders in green have won all five monuments. Number of wins in gold indicates the current record holder(s).\nWinners of three monuments in a single year.\nOnly Eddy Merckx has been able to win three monuments in a single year – and he did it four times:\nWinners of two monuments in a single year.\n26 different riders (including Eddy Merckx) have managed to win two Monuments in the same year. The most common \"double\" consists of the two cobbled classics (Tour of Flanders and Paris–Roubaix), which have been won by the same rider in the same year on 13 occasions. The Italian \"double\" (Milan–San Remo and Giro di Lombardia) has been achieved 11 times (including Merckx in 1971 and 1972). Only Merckx has won the combinations \"Milan–San Remo/Tour of Flanders\" and \"Tour of Flanders/Liège–Bastogne–Liège\", when he won all three Monuments in 1969 and 1975. Only once have two riders (Tadej Pogačar and Mathieu van der Poel) won two Monuments each in the same year (2023). \nWomen's events.\nBoth Belgian 'monuments' – The Tour of Flanders and Liège–Bastogne–Liège Femmes – organise women's events on the same day and partly the same course as the men's events. A women's version of Milan–San Remo, named Primavera Rosa, was initiated in 1999, but cancelled after 2005. The first edition of Paris–Roubaix Femmes took place in October 2021, after the 2020 edition was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 race was won by Lizzie Deignan, who became the first women's rider to win a classic triple crown of the three existing monuments, having won 'Ronde van Vlaanderen' in 2016, and Liege-Bastogne-Liege in 2020."

He played in the premiership victories of 1968, 1970 and 1971. Grant starred with two tries in Souths' convincing 23–12 victory over Manly in the 1970 Grand Final.\nIn all he played 135 club games for South Sydney between 1966 and 1975.\nGrant was voted Rugby League Week Player of the Year for his performances during the 1971 premiership season. In 2004 he was named by Souths in their \"South Sydney Dream Team\", consisting of 17 players and a coach representing the club from 1908 through to 2004.\nRepresentative career.\nGrant made two Test appearances for the Australian national representative side in 1970 and 1971 and represented in one game for New South Wales. From 1964 to 1969 St. George's Billy Smith held a virtual monopoly on the Australian representative half-back spot, then from 1970 Tommy Raudonikis began to emerge. Undoubtedly Bob Grant's representative opportunities suffered due to these fine players being his peers."

On a recreational sailboat, the cockpit is considered the safest external location for crew.\n A bridge deck is a raised separation between an external cockpit and cabin or saloon, used to keep water from astern from entering from the cockpit, especially in following seas.\nHistory.\nIn the Royal Navy, the term \"cockpit\" originally referred to the area where the coxswain was stationed. This led to the word being used to refer to the area towards the stern of a small decked vessel that houses the rudder controls. The midshipmen and master's mates were later berthed in the cockpit, and it served as the action station for the ship's surgeon and his mates during battle."

        "text": "The Cyprus national rugby union team is nicknamed ‘’The Mighty Mouflons’’ after a kind of horned sheep which is also the republic's national animal. They have won 28 of their 30 games and hold the world record for the most consecutive international rugby union wins with 24, which was ended on 15 November 2014 as they lost to Latvia. They were controversially disqualified from the knock-out phase of the 2015 Rugby World Cup Qualifiers, as they did not meet the necessary membership criteria according to the International Rugby Board.\nHistory.\nThe first international game of the Cyprus national rugby union team took place on 24 March 2007 against Greece in Paphos. The Cypriot XV won the game by 39-3 in front of 2,500 fans.[3]\nIn October and November 2007, Cyprus beat Azerbaijan, Monaco and Slovakia to win the 2006–08 European Nations Cup Division 3D, in their first year on the international scene. However, they lost the play-off game for promotion to Division 3C for the 2008–10 European Nations Cup on 6 September 2008 against Israel by a score of 23-14. This was Cyprus' only loss in international rugby for 6 years.\nThe following season, Cyprus had another attempt to be promoted as they played Bosnia and Herzegovina, Azerbaijan and Monaco in a round-robin home-and-away basis. They won every game scoring a total of 187 points and conceding only 17. They gained automatic promotion to Division 3B, although, for the following season, the divisions had changed numbers, so instead of moving to Division 3B, they were in fact in Division 2D.\nThe 2010–12 European Nations Cup saw Cyprus play in Division 2D (the lowest level of the second division) against Bulgaria, Finland, Greece and Luxembourg. They won all their games for the second consecutive year increasing their win success to 15 and making it two consecutive seasons and nearly four years unbeaten. They scored 4 or more tries in each of their games during the 2010–2012 season, including an emphatic 94–3 win over Bulgaria, and were promoted to Division 2C for 2012–2014.\nTheir 2012–14 European Nations Cup Division 2B campaign kicked off in style with a 54–20 win over Austria. They followed that win with consecutive home and away wins against Slovenia, Bulgaria and Hungary and also a home win over Austria. On 16 March 2013 ahead of their match against Bulgaria, Cyprus were aware of a potential world record of 18 games unbeaten which would overtake the official record of 17 games originally held by both New Zealand (between 1965 and 1969 and again between 2013 and 2014), South Africa (between 1997 and 1998) and Lithuania (between 2006 and 2010). They won the match comfortably 79–10. A month later, Cyprus were informed that they would not be eligible to qualify for the 2015 Rugby World Cup and were disqualified by the International Rugby Board due to 'not meeting the necessary membership criteria'.\nCyprus played in Division 2B for the 2014–16 European Nations Cup, where they were grouped with Lithuania, Latvia, Andorra and Hungary.\nMotto.\nThe Cyprus Rugby Federation has adopted as its motto the famous Spartan phrase:\nἪ τὰν ἢ ἐπὶ τᾶς, translating as \"either with this or upon this\", an idiom that effectively means victory or death. The origin of the motto is ancient Sparta and \"this\" refers to the shield. Spartans killed in battle were carried home on the shield, while those returning alive and victorious from battle would still have it. A soldier fleeing the battle would have to drop the shield.\nKit.\nHome\nAway\nRecords.\nHome grounds.\nUntil March 2010, Cyprus did not have a National Stadium, due to the poor recognition of the government they did not supply a stadium. Cyprus' first international was played in Paphos at Kiniras Sports ground. Then a further game at the same ground in the ENC 3D tournament against Slovakia. They then moved to the British Army base playing their games at Happy Valley in Episkopi. Now the national stadium has been recognised as Pafiako Stadium which is situated in the centre of Paphos. It holds a capacity of 10,000.\nInternational record.\nSince their first match in 2007, Cyprus have lost only 15 matches out of Fifty.\nThey recorded their first win over Malta on 23 November by 18 to 16 to celebrate their 50th International, which now gives them a 70% winning ratio.\nCyprus are not a full member of the International Rugby Board, so none of their international matches count towards the IRB World Rankings.\nOverall.\nBelow is a table of the representative rugby matches played by a Cyprus national XV at test level up until 13 May 2023:\nCurrent squad.\nThe following players formed the squad for the 2021–22 Rugby Europe Conference 1 South match against Croatia.\nStaff"

        "text": "Mary Geraldine (Bonnie) Baker, \"née\" George (July 10, 1918 – December 17, 2003) was an all-star baseball catcher in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL) from 1943 to 1952.\nCareer.\nWith the majority of major-league baseball players in the military during World War II, Phil Wrigley owner of the Chicago Cubs, established the AAGPBL in 1943 where it continued until 1954. The first year the league played by softball rules, but that gradually changed until it was nearly identical with professional baseball.\nBaker began her career with the South Bend Blue Sox in the league's first season and stayed with the team until 1950. All of Baker's eight brothers and sisters were baseball catchers, so it stood to reason that she would become one too. She was discovered by professional scout Hub Bishop who would later also discover notable Saskatchewan athletes like Gordie Howe of the Detroit Red Wings. She was one of 68 Canadian players in the AAGPBL, while her sister, Genevieve George, also played in the league for the Kalamazoo Lassies. When Baker joined the AAGPBL, she initially had promised her husband, who was fighting overseas in World War II, that she would quit the game when he returned. \nBaker had also been a former model and was often chosen by the league to pose for publicity shots and act as a league spokesperson. She was the league's most publicized player and was referred to as \"Pretty Bonnie Baker\" by the press. She appeared on the popular television show \"What's My Line?\" on August 17, 1952 and her picture also appeared in \"Life\" magazine. Although she was easily the most recognized AAGPBL player, it never stopped her from doing her job. She was an all star in 1943 and 1946 and played 930 games in her career. She hit .235 for her career, with 1 home run, 244 RBI and 465 runs. Her career fielding average was .953. In 1946, Baker had an all-star season, stealing a league-leading 94 bases and batting .286 with a .965 fielding percentage.\nDuring the 1950 season, Baker was traded to the Kalamazoo Lassies to act as a player-manager, becoming the only woman in league history to do so. The struggling Lassies placed last in the league with a 36–73 record. The following year the league passed a rule banning female managers. Baker skipped the 1951 season to have a daughter, Maureen (aka \"Chickie\"), but returned to the Lassies for one year in 1952.\nShe later returned to Saskatchewan, where she led the Regina Legion softball team to the World Ladies Softball title. In 1964-65 she worked for the Regina radio station CKRM, as the first female sports broadcaster in Canada. She also managed the Wheat City Curling Club for 25 years.\nBaker appeared as a contestant on the August 17, 1952 episode of the tv game show \"What's My Line?\". Panellist Dorothy Kilgallen guessed that Baker was a professional baseball player.\nDeath and honours.\nBaker died of respiratory failure at 85. Fellow AAGPBL player Arleene Noga remembers her as \"a complete player with all five tools — a real competitor.\" In 1998 she was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. She is also a member of the Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame and the Saskatchewan Baseball Hall of Fame, and is part of the special exhibit on the AAGPBL in the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.\nThe 1992 Geena Davis-Tom Hanks movie \"A League of Their Own\" was a fictional account of the AAGPBL. Davis's character, Dottie Hinson, is loosely based on Bonnie Baker.\nIn 2018, Baker was posthumously awarded the Order of Sport, marking her induction into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.\nIn 2023 there was a Heritage Minute created about her."

        "title": "The West Indies Cricket Annual",
        "text": "The West Indies Cricket Annual was a cricket annual published from 1970 to 1991 which covered cricket in the West Indies and by West Indian teams overseas. It was the first annual to cover all aspects of West Indies cricket in detail. All 22 editions were edited by Tony Cozier. Most of the photographs taken by cricket journalist Gordon Brooks have featured in the magazine.\nIt was generally A4 size although the height varied a little over the years. Most editions were 88 pages although this varied from 84 to 96 pages. The exception was the 1972 edition which had only 68 pages.\nFrom 1978 to 1982 and from 1984 to 1991 the publication was called \"The Benson &amp; Hedges West Indies Cricket Annual\".\nIt was succeeded by the \"Caribbean Cricket Quarterly\".\nTypical contents.\nThe content varied somewhat over the years but the typical contents are given below. A particular feature of the annual was the good coverage of West Indies cricket at below first-class level.\nThe Annual never included a records section.\nFive cricketers of the year.\nEach year five cricketers of the year were chosen based on performances in the West Indies and on West Indies tours overseas. The annual included a biography of the selections. Until 1981 a player was only chosen once (like the \"Wisden Cricketers of the Year\") but in that year Viv Richards was chosen for the second time and from 1983 the selection was made solely on merit. In 1987 only four players were chosen.\nWho's Who.\nFrom the 1973 edition a \"West Indies Cricket Who's Who\" was included. This included players who had represented the West Indies or one of the Territorial teams. Those who had only played in the Beaumont Cup (Texaco Cup) on Trinidad or the Jones Cup in Guyana were not included in the \"Who's Who\" even when these matches were first-class. Career figures were included in the \"Who's Who\".\nObituaries.\nInitially the annual just contained occasional obituaries. The 1971 edition contained one of Learie Constantine and the 1972 edition one of Manny Martindale. There were 3 obituaries in the 1973 edition (Eric Inniss, Augustus Gregoire and Kenny Wishart) and none in the 1974 edition. From the 1975 edition the obituary section became a regular feature which gradually expanded over the years."

        "text": "Paul Harvey Robinson (born December 19, 1944) is an American former professional football player who was a running back for two seasons in the American Football League (AFL) and four seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Arizona Wildcats.\nEarly life.\nRobinson was one of 12 children of Leslie Robinson Sr. (1907–1987) and Levada Mallard Robinson (1909–1956), both of Crockett, Texas, who were married in 1926. In 1951, the family moved to Marana, Arizona where Leslie worked as a farm contractor. Paul attended Marana High School, where he played basketball and football, but he especially excelled at track.\nHe graduated from high school in 1963 and attended Eastern Arizona College, a community college in Thatcher, Arizona. He then received a track scholarship to the University of Arizona and ran track for two years for the Wildcats. But when his track scholarship ended, Robinson turned to football out of necessity for one season, becoming the team's #2 running back his senior year.\nProfessional football career.\nRobinson was chosen in the third round (82nd overall) of the 1968 NFL/AFL Draft by the Cincinnati Bengals.\nIn his first year as a professional, he gained 1,023 yards rushing to lead the league and scored eight touchdowns. He also caught 24 passes for 128 yards and one touchdown. He was the second man to gain over 1,000 yards in his first year in professional football in the U.S., the first being Cookie Gilchrist. Robinson is the only running back in professional football history to gain over 1,000 yards in a season for a first-year expansion team.\nHe was the 1968 United Press International and \"Sporting News\" AFL Rookie of the Year and finished second in the MVP voting to Joe Namath. He was named to the 1968 and 1969 AFL All-Star Team and led the 1968 Western AFL All-Star team to victory over the Eastern All-Stars.\nHe also scored the first-ever Bengals regular-season touchdown on September 6, 1968. His two-yard run gave the Bengals a 7–0 lead over the San Diego Chargers at San Diego, although the Bengals lost 29–13.\nIn his second season, 1969, he gained 489 yards in 160 attempts for a 3.1 yards-per-carry average and four touchdowns. He rebounded his third season, 1970, for 622 yards in 149 attempts for a 4.2 average and six touchdowns.\nIn 1971, he gained 213 yards on 49 carries for a 4.3 average with one touchdown.\nIn 1972, in four games with the Bengals, he gained 94 yards in 21 attempts, a 4.5 average. On October 24, 1972, he was traded along with running back Fred Willis to the Houston Oilers for wide receiver Charlie Joiner and linebacker Ron Pritchard. For the Oilers, he played in eight games, gaining 355 yards on 86 attempts for a 4.1 average and three touchdowns.\nHis final year in the NFL was 1973 for the Oilers, when he gained 151 yards on 34 attempts for a 4.4 average and two touchdowns.\nFor his career, he gained 2,947 yards on 737 carries for a 4.0 average with 24 touchdowns. He caught 90 passes for 612 yards (a 6.8 average) for two touchdowns. He returned 40 kicks for 924 yards, a 23.1 average, and he returned two punts for one yard.\nIn 1974, he played for the Birmingham Americans of the World Football League, where he helped the Americans win the WFL’s only championship game before the team folded during the offseason.\nPersonal life.\nPaul Robinson was married to the late Arlene (Hines) Robinson. They had three daughters and also a son, Paul Harvey \"PJ\" Robinson Jr., who died in 2009. Paul is also the granduncle of Atlanta Falcons running back Bijan Robinson. He currently resides in Safford, Arizona."
