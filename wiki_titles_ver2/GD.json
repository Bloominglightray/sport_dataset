        "title": "Alexandra and Eastern Hills Cricket Association",
        "text": "The Alexandra and Eastern Hills Cricket Association (A&amp;EHCA) is a cricket association in the Adelaide Hills and Fleurieu and Kangaroo Island regions of South Australia. It is an affiliated association of the South Australian Cricket Association. The A&amp;EHCA runs senior men's cricket competitions across five grades (A Grade, A2 Grade, B Grade, C Grade and D Grade) and junior competitions at the under 16, under 14, under 12 and under 10 age groups.\nHistory.\nAlexandra Cricket Association (1908-1983).\nThe earliest recorded match in the Strathalbyn district was played between Strathalbyn and Macclesfield in April 1859.  Several more clubs appeared in the 1860s and 1870s, and for a long time each one organised its own matches against neighbouring towns. Most towns did not have a proper cricket pitch until about 1895-1905 when slate pitches began to be laid. Presumably, until that time just a level piece of ground had to serve the purpose. \nAlthough the concept of an association had been raised from time to time, it was not until 1908 that one eventuated. It was called the Alexandra Cricket Association (ACA), presumably named after Queen Alexandra, the wife of King Edward VII who was monarch at that time. The original member clubs were based in Strathalbyn, Ashbourne, Milang, and Langhorne Creek. The association lapsed after just one year. It re-formed in 1910/1911 without Milang and Langhorne Creek, but with the addition of Meadows. In 1913/1914 the association lapsed again and was not revived until 1920 when Milang re-joined and Woodchester and Callington entered for the first time. The association lapsed yet again for the 1924/1925 and 1925/1926 seasons. Ashbourne, evidently exasperated with the stop-start nature of the competition, departed in 1925/1926 to join the Great Southern Cricket Association and stayed there for the next five years. Although the ACA re-formed again in 1926/1927 it was now without its trump card, Ashbourne, which had won every premiership except the first. Strathalbyn split into two teams (East and West) and Callington joined up again (but for one year only). Throughout this period, association matches were not scheduled for every Saturday of the season, and clubs were free to organise their own non-association matches on a regular basis. Some clubs continued to play whole seasons of non-association cricket e.g. between 1908 and 1945 Milang was a member of the Alexandra Association for only 12 seasons and Langhorne Creek for only 8 seasons, yet these were two of the biggest towns in the district. They played plenty of cricket, but most of it was outside the Association. Finniss was a late starter and did not join until 1929.  Five years later they won their first of a procession of premierships, and became the new measuring-stick of the competition. In 1932 Strathalbyn withdrew to form its own Strathalbyn Cricket Association of four Strathalbyn teams (Schools, Centrals, Angas and Rovers), but this experiment lasted for only one season – the only time that Strathalbyn was not a member of the ACA.  Belvidere joined up in 1934 and stayed until the intervention of World War II.\nThe period between 1908 and the early 1930s belonged to Ashbourne which won 11 premierships, but the next period would belong to Finniss. Between 1932 and 1952 Finniss featured in every grand final except one, winning eight in a row, both before and after the war.  The continued dominance of the tiny towns of Ashbourne and Finniss over their much larger rivals Strathalbyn, Milang, and Langhorne Creek, for such a long period, is quite remarkable. Until 1953 Milang had won only one premiership (way back in 1929/1930) and Langhorne Creek had won none at all. Langhorne Creek finally broke through in 1954/1955 for its first premiership, after which Milang got three in a row, and Langhorne Creek three more in a row. Macclesfield entered the association in 1945 (and stayed for seven years), Strathalbyn High School joined in 1946 (for two years), along with Colts in 1952 (for two years). The Colts consisted of players under 20 years of age from Strathalbyn and Milang, and two senior players. None of these teams made much impression or threatened to win any premierships. Milang Colts appeared in 1958 (for four seasons), Langhorne Creek Colts in 1961 (for one year only), and Macclesfield re-entered in 1961 and stayed for 9 years. In 1961/1962 the competition split into separate A &amp; B grades after the first round, and thereafter a B Grade competition existed in one form or another (sometimes from the start of the season, sometimes at the end of the minor round). Hartley joined in 1965 but the club disbanded just five years later. High School entered in 1970 and made a quick impression by winning two premierships in five years. Separate A and B Grades for the whole season commenced in 1978, but it appeared that the competition was stagnating – the same five clubs (Strathalbyn, Milang, Langhorne Creek, Ashbourne and Finniss) were competing every year, and there was a lack of new blood and new challenges.\nIt so happened that the Mt Barker and Eastern Hills Cricket Association was also stagnating and a hasty round of discussions shortly before the commencement of the 1983/1984 season resulted in a merger of the two associations into the new Alexandra and Eastern Hills Association. The 1983/1984 season commenced with ten teams in A Grade (the above-mentioned five from Alexandra plus Mount Barker, Echunga, Nairne, Wistow, and Bremer/Callington). There were a further eight teams in B Grade (Strathalbyn, Milang, Ashbourne, Langhorne Creek, Bremer/Callington, Echunga, Nairne, and Macclesfield).  Finniss withdrew in 1995, and Hahndorf transferred in from the Hills Cricket Association in 1997. Finniss re-entered in B Grade in 2007/2008, by which time there were seven teams in A Grade, eleven in B Grade, and twelve in C Grade – a total of 30 senior teams.\nBetween 1908 and 1965 the ACA had only two presidents – James Bell (owner of the chain of Bell's Stores based in Strathalbyn) served from 1908 until his death in January 1936, and the legendary Harry Meyer (from Ashbourne) continued from 1936 to 1965 when he was 80 years of age. More recently, from 1977/1978 until 1989/1990, Keith Ness presided over the transition to the new Alexandra and Eastern Hills Cricket Association. Harry Meyer became the ACA's first Life Member in 1964, Ashbourne's Vin Payne the second in 1965, and Murray Johnson from Langhorne Creek in 1978 was the third (but perhaps through an oversight, it was not awarded until 1982). Since the merger in 1983, eight more stalwarts of the A&amp;EHCA have been awarded Life Memberships: Keith Ness (Finniss), Trevor Calaby (Macclesfield), Perry Jones (Strathalbyn), Clive Wundersitz (Bremer/Callington), Geoff Warren (Langhorne Creek), Roger Farley (Bremer/Callington), Trevor Potts (Langhorne Creek) and Cheryl Gillies (Macclesfield).\nThe format of match play has varied considerably over the years. Until the 1930s, mainly one-day matches were held, with no compulsory declarations, resulting in a huge number of draws. Even when two-day-matches were introduced there was initially no compulsory declaration at the end of the first day. Most ovals had concrete wickets (with matting), but in 1937/1938 the Association backed Harry Meyer's move to install a turf wicket in Strathalbyn with a view to attracting big matches. Harry organised another turf wicket on his home ground (Ashbourne) in the 1960s, the High School added one in about 1972 before Langhorne Creek followed in about 1973. Callington's was the most recent in the early 1990s. \nAlthough several clubs have fielded two A grade teams in the same year e.g. Strathalbyn (two A Grade teams for 23 seasons), Milang (for 14 seasons), Langhorne Creek (for 7 seasons) and Finniss (for 2 seasons), on only one occasion in the history of the ACA have two teams from the same club met in a grand final. That was in 1971-1972 when Strath White met Strath Red. Although the ACA celebrated its centenary in 2008, it did not exist for 15 of those years (1909–10, 1913-14 to 1919-1920 inclusive, 1924-5, 1925-6, and 1940-1 to 1944-5 inclusive).\nThe handsome Alexandra Cup was presented to the A Grade premier from 1908 to 1983. Surprisingly, there appear to be three consecutive errors engraved on the cup – for 1939, 1940 and 1946. Despite the fact that Strath West, Ashbourne, and Callington appear on the Cup, it seems absolutely certain from all other records available that Finniss won all three.\nThe Meyer Shield inter-association competition was initiated in 1964/1965 named in honour of Harry Meyer's long and outstanding service to the Association. Initially four associations (Alexandra, Hills, Mt Barker &amp; Eastern Hills and Torrens Valley) participated, but the number grew to eight as Great Southern, Southern, Kangaroo Island, and Murray Towns were added in the years ahead. Alexandra has won this competition only three times (1973, 1976, 1977), Mt Barker and Eastern Hills five times (1966, 1967, 1969, 1972, 1974) and Alexandra and Eastern Hills only three times (1989, 1997, 2014). The Under 21 Figg Cup was also awarded from 1964/1965, followed by the Under 16 Calaby Shield from 1978/1979, and the Under 14 Fuller Shield from 1992-1993.\nA Rotary Cup knockout one-day competition commenced in about 1975/1976 on Sundays with teams from five local clubs (Strathalbyn, Ashbourne, Langhorne Creek, Milang and Finniss). Within a few years eight more clubs from outside the ACA had all joined in. The final season of the Rotary Club competition was 1995/1996 when Nairne won the title. In recent years it has been replaced by the Courier Super Challenge knockout series involving teams from the three Adelaide Hills based associations – A&amp;EH, Hills and Torrens Valley.\nAshbourne's Harry Meyer attended Country Carnivals organised by the SA Cricket Association in for over 40 years from 1909/1910 (or earlier).  From about 1922 until at least 1954 he organised a team from the Fleurieu Peninsula to compete against about 7 other country districts from all over South Australia. His team was variously called Combined Southern Areas, Alexandra, and Southern (or Fleurieu since 1992), and won the competition in 1926, 1930, 1938, 1955, 1958, 1979, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2008. The H.R. Meyer Challenge Cup, donated by Ashbourne's Harry Meyer, has been awarded to the winner from 1925 until the present day. One of the H.R. Meyer Cups is housed in the Museum at Adelaide Oval (teams could retain the Cup after three wins). Since the first country carnival in 1895/1896, thirteen centuries and one double century have been scored on Adelaide Oval by Alexandra players. No carnival matches have been scheduled on Adelaide Oval since 1968/1969 so it appears no more players will share that honour.\nAnother state-wide carnival, conducted by the Country Carnival Cricket Association, is also held in annually. Keith Ness (Finniss) took an Alexandra team to these carnivals for about 25–30 years from the early 1960s. He was said to be the oldest (68 or 69 years) and longest-serving player/manager in the competition when he retired in the late 1980s. Alexandra has won the Shield only twice – in 1980 and 1985. In the 1960s over 40 teams competed but in more recent years the number has fallen to about ten.\nThe Alexandra junior competition began in a small way in about 1963 when Ralph Briggs (Milang) and Harry Pitt (Strathalbyn) arranged a few scratch matches between the two towns on Saturday mornings for boys under 16 years of age. A year or so later Keith Ness added a team from Finniss. By 1965 there were teams from Ashbourne and Langhorne Creek, and a formal competition was established. Under the A&amp;EHCA, an Under 12 competition was added in 1984, and this was revised to Under 13 in 1986. In 1998 this was separated further into separate Under 14 and Under 12 competitions. By 2007/2008 this had grown to four age groups: Under 16 (7 teams), Under 14 (11 teams), Under 12 (14 teams), and Under 10. This represents an astonishing growth since the A&amp;EHCA was formed in 1983.\nMount Barker and Eastern Hills Cricket Association (1931-1983).\nCricket has been played in the Adelaide Hills from as far back as 1843, but most clubs probably commenced closer to 1900. The Hills Cricket Association (HCA) was formed in 1922 with four member clubs: Mount Barker, Echunga, Macclesfield, and Meadows. The former three are now members of the A&amp;EHCA, but Meadows is not. However, Meadows had previously been a member of the Alexandra Cricket Association for three years from 1910/1911 to 1912/1913.\nThe Eastern Hills Cricket Association (EHCA) commenced in 1931/1932 with five member clubs: Bremer, Littlehampton, Nairne, Dawesley and Mount Barker B. Murdoch's Hill and joined a year later, but Dawesley withdrew. Watts’ Brickyard entered in 1933/1934 and disappeared. Mt Barker B withdrew in 1934/1935 to play in their own newly-formed Mt Barker District Cricket Association. Callington and Harrogate joined the EHCA in 1935/1936. Although the EHCA never had more than six teams at a time, 16 different clubs have participated at one time or another. Most have joined up for a few years and then withdrawn, and only three have been regular members on a long-term basis – Bremer (Kanmantoo), Callington, and Nairne.  Other occasional members have been Littlehampton (9 seasons, 5 premierships), Murdoch's Hill (14 seasons, 2 premierships), Woodside (1 season), Woodside RSL (5 seasons, 1 premiership in 1955-6), Harrogate (5 seasons), Mt Barker B (3 seasons), Watts’ Brickyards (10 seasons 1 premiership), 16th Battalion (Woodside, 3 seasons), Monarto (3 seasons), Nairne Veterans (2 seasons), 2nd Field Ambulance (2 seasons), Native Valley (1 season), Dawesley (1 season). \nThe J.E. Wooley Shield (named after the EHCA's first president) was presented to the EHCA premier for the 24 years of the association's existence. By far the most successful club was Bremer, with 10 premierships, including the last four (to 1959/1960).\nThe Mount Barker District Cricket Association (MtBDCA) was formed in 1934/1935 and consisted of three Mount Barker teams (Blues, Whites, and Methodists), plus Wistow. Hahndorf joined a year later, Flaxley and Echunga in 1947/1948, Macclesfield in 1952/1953, and Onkaparinga in 1953/1954. Apart from the Methodists (who lasted only 3 seasons), all of the others listed above were still members in 1960 when the two associations merged. Three other clubs had briefly been members: Littlehampton (1939/1940 &amp; 1946/1947), High School (1946/1947) and Junior Colts (1937/1938). The Dr. R.V. Pridmore Shield was won by Mount Barker teams 14 times in the 20 years before the merger with EHCA. The Whites got 8 premierships, and the Blues got 6, but no team was able to win more than two in a row.\nThe Mount Barker and Eastern Hills Cricket Association (MtB&amp;EHCA) commenced in 1960/1961 with twelve teams, all in one grade. From the former MtBDCA there were Mt Barker Blue, Mt Barker White, Wistow, Hahndorf, Echunga, Flaxley, and Onkaparinga (but not Macclesfield), and from the former EHCA there were only Bremer, Callington, Nairne 1, and Nairne 2. Murdoch's Hill departed to play in the Torrens Valley Cricket Association, and Hartley entered as a new team  Twelve teams were obviously too unwieldy in one grade, and in the following year two grades were formed, with ten teams in A Grade and six in B Grade. There was a further shakeout in 1962/1963 after which the A Grade settled down to 6-8 teams for the next 20 years. Mt Barker Red joined in 1965/1966, but by 1971/1972 only one Mt Barker team remained in A Grade. Bremer/Callington merged in 1968/1969, and Flaxley/Macclesfield in 1970/1971. Lenswood Ranges made a lightning raid in 1977/1978, having transferred from the Torrens Valley Cricket Association and won four premierships in a row in their five years with MtB&amp;EHCA. However, Lenswood Ranges and Onkaparinga both departed in 1982/1983, and the association was starting to look shaky. There were two other clubs that had briefly appeared in A Grade: Biggs Flat (3 seasons from 1963/1964 to 1965/1966), and Woodside (1966/1967). In the 23 years from 1960/1961 to the final amalgamation with the Alexandra Cricket Association in 1983/1984, the honours had been shared across several clubs: Wistow (8 premierships), Onkaparinga (4), Lenswood Ranges (4), Mount Barker (only 3), Nairne (2), Flaxley/Macclesfield (1), Echunga (1), and Bremer/Callington (1). Wistow obviously punched well above its weight, but the surprise is that Mt Barker Red, White, and Blue did not win more premierships. The Dr R.V. Pridmore Shield was awarded to the A Grade premier of the MtBDCA, and later the MtB&amp;EHCA, from 1935 to 1983. A Colts (Under 16) competition was introduced in about 1964/1965 and continued up until the merger with the Alexandra Cricket Association in 1983.\nAlexandra and Eastern Hills Cricket Association (1983 - present).\nThe A&amp;EHCA was established ahead of the 1983/1984 season when the Alexandra Cricket Association amalgamated with the Mount Barker and Eastern Hills Cricket Association. The decision to amalgamate the two neighbouring associations was initiated by Keith Ness who was subsequently elected as the first President of the newly established A&amp;EHCA. The foundation clubs of the A&amp;EHCA were Ashbourne, Bremer/Callington, Echunga, Finniss, Langhorne Creek, Macclesfield, Milang, Mount Barker, Nairne, Strathalbyn and Wistow. Finniss went into recess for 12 seasons following the 1995/1996 season before returning in 2007/2008. Milang went into a brief recess after the 2014/2015 season before returning in 2017/2018 (for just one season) and then lapsing once again.

        "title": "Ty Johnson (American football)",
        "text": "Ty Marquise Johnson (born September 17, 1997) is an American football running back for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Maryland.\nEarly years.\nJohnson grew up in Cumberland, Maryland, and is a member of the graduating class of 2015 at Fort Hill High School. Johnson was a multi-year starter at both running back and defensive back for the high school football team. In his junior and senior seasons at Fort Hill in 2013 and 2014, Johnson lead the Sentinels to back to back Maryland 1A State Football Championships. After both seasons, Johnson was named Area High School Football Player of the Year by the Cumberland Times-News, and in 2014 was named to the Maryland High School Consensus All-State team by the Maryland High School Football Foundation. Johnson was responsible for nearly 5,000 all-purpose yards and 65 touchdowns during his two full varsity seasons.\nCollege career.\nJohnson was rated as a three-star college prospect, the 20th best recruit in the state of Maryland, and the 64th best running back prospect in the country by Rivals. Johnson verbally committed to the Maryland Terrapins briefly after being offered a scholarship in June 2014 by then-head coach Randy Edsall at a football camp at Maryland Stadium. Johnson officially signed his letter of intent to attend Maryland in February 2015. While Johnson was recruited by other programs, he did not receive a scholarship offer from a Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) program other than the Terrapins.\nIn four seasons with the Terrapins, Johnson tallied 4,196 all-purpose yards, third in program history. In his sophomore season in 2016, Johnson set the Terrapins’ single season yards per carry record, averaging 9.1 yards per rushing attempt. Johnson also starred as a kick returner, finishing his collegiate career with 1,194 kick return yards and two return touchdowns, one going for 100 yards against Ohio State in 2017, and another going for 98 yards against Michigan in 2018. Johnson graduated from Maryland in December 2018.\nProfessional career.\nJohnson did not receive an invitation to the 2019 NFL Scouting Combine. However, at Maryland's football pro day, scouts from 29 NFL teams, plus scouts from two Arena Football League teams, one team each from the Austrian Football League, German Football League and one Canadian Football League team were present to observe the workouts of 15 Maryland players, including Johnson. Johnson impressed scouts by running a 40-yard dash time clocked by most scouts as anywhere between 4.3 and 4.4 seconds, with one scout reportedly timing Johnson as fast as 4.26 seconds. For comparison, the fastest 40-yard dash time ran by any running back at the 2019 NFL Scouting Combine was 4.40 seconds by Justice Hill of the Oklahoma State Cowboys. At his pro day workout, Johnson was also able to do 27 repetitions of the bench press at 225 pounds, which would have ranked the highest among 2019 Combine running backs, and was recorded jumping a 34-inch vertical.\nDetroit Lions.\nJohnson was drafted by the Detroit Lions in the sixth round (186th overall) of the 2019 NFL Draft. Johnson made his NFL debut in the Lions' regular season opener against the Arizona Cardinals and had a six-yard carry in the 27–27 tie. Johnson made his first career start in Week 10 against the Chicago Bears and had five carries for 16 rushing yards. Overall, in his rookie season, Johnson had 63 carries for 273 rushing yards and 24 receptions for 109 receiving yards.\nOn October 1, 2020, Johnson was waived by the Lions.\nNew York Jets.\nOn October 2, 2020, Johnson was claimed off waivers by the New York Jets.\nIn Week 13 against the Las Vegas Raiders, Johnson rushed 22 times for 104 yards and a touchdown during the 31–28 loss. Two weeks later, the Jets secured their first win on the season against the Los Angeles Rams. Johnson rushed for 16 yards on three carries, added six receptions for 39 yards, and scored the Jets' first touchdown on an 18-yard completion from quarterback Sam Darnold. \nJohnson was re-signed on March 28, 2023. Shortly thereafter, Johnson suffered a torn pec during an offseason workout. He was released by the Jets with a non-football injury designation on April 26, 2023.\nBuffalo Bills.\nOn August 21, 2023, Johnson signed with the Buffalo Bills. He was waived on August 29, 2023, and re-signed to the practice squad. He was promoted to the active roster on October 20, 2023. \nJohnson remained on the Bills active roster through the end of the 2023 regular season and into the postseason. He finished the regular season with 194 all-purpose yards and a receiving touchdown, which he scored in Week 11 against the New York Jets. In the Bills' two postseason games following the 2023 season, including a victory against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the wild card round and a loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in the divisional round, Johnson rushed 15 times for 66 yards, which put him over 1,000 total rushing yards for his career.\nJohnson re-signed with the Bills on March 19, 2024."

During the 2022/23 regular season, the 14 teams achieved an average attendance of more than 7000 spectators per game.\nWomen.\nThe top women’s hockey league in Switzerland was founded in 1986 as the (LKA; 'Performance Class A'), officially known in French as the (LNA) and in Italian as the (LNA). It was renamed as the Swiss Women's Hockey League A (SWHL A) in 2014. In 2019, the league name was shortened to Women's League, the name currently in use, though SWHL A continues to be used for abbreviation by many sources. The EHC Kloten Specials were named the first Swiss Champions in women's ice hockey after winning the inaugural season of the league in 1986–87.\nAs ice hockey grew in popularity among young women throughout the nation, a second-tier league called the (LKB), was formed in 1988. Additional lower-level leagues were created over time and eventually adopted designations as parts of the SWHL league system. , three national leagues exist below the Women's League: SWHL B, SWHL C, and SWHL D.\nNational team.\nThe Swiss national team badge is based on the coat of arms of Switzerland and is used on the player jerseys.\nMen.\nOverall International Record: 519-619-125\nThey have 67 IIHF Championships appearances dating all the way back to 1930.

They won a bronze medal at the 1995 IIHF European Women Championships, the 2012 IIHF Women's World Championship, and in the women's ice hockey tournament at the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nNotable Swiss players in the NHL.\nSwitzerland has produced several global iconic hockey talents that have made it to the NHL level. While not a traditional hockey powerhouse, Switzerland continues to aggressively enforce a continued &amp; growing presence in the NHL, as well as international competition.\nDavid Aebischer.\nAebischer was a goaltender drafted in the 6th round by the Colorado Avalanche. Although mostly relegated to backup duties for most of his career he was a member of the Stanley Cup winning Avalanche in the 2001 finals. This was notable as he was the first player from Switzerland to win the Stanley Cup. Aebischer also later played for the Montreal Canadiens and the Phoenix Coyotes along with various Swiss teams.\nMark Streit.\nStreit was named the 13th captain in New York Islanders franchise history. This was a major milestone for hockey in Switzerland as Streit was the first Swiss player to be named the captain of an NHL franchise. He has also served as the captain of Team Switzerland at the Winter Olympic Games. Streit was drafted in the ninth round of the 2004 NHL Draft. He also later played with the Philadelphia Flyers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Montreal Canadiens.\nJonas Hiller.\nAlthough Hiller went undrafted he was able to have a successful NHL career in which he played in over 400 games. Hiller started his career in Anaheim with the Ducks in 2007. He played in Anaheim for seven years before spending the final two years of his career with the Calgary Flames.\nNino Niederreiter.\nNino Niederreiter is an NHL forward currently playing for the Winnipeg Jets. Niederreiter made history in the 2010 NHL draft when he was selected fifth overall by the New York Islanders. Although not initially finding much success initially with the Islanders, Niederreiter hit his stride after being traded to the Minnesota Wild for Cal Clutterbuck in 2013 scoring a career high 25 goals in the 2016-2017.\nRoman Josi.\nAfter being drafted in the second round of the 2008 NHL draft by Nashville he made his debut in 2011. Josi made some history in the 2013 World Championships by becoming the first player to win MVP and Best Defenseman for Switzerland in the history of this tournament in route to helping Switzerland earn a Silver Medal. Josi has since played in two NHL All Star games and been named captain of the Predators.\nTimo Meier.\nMeier is among the emerging young group of highly touted Swiss to enter the NHL in recent years. Meier was the ninth overall pick in the 2015 NHL draft by the San Jose Sharks. He was able to crack the NHL in the 2016 season and scored a career high 30 goals and 66 points in the 2018-2019 season.\nNico Hischier.\nAfter being a major success playing in the QMJHL for Halifax, Hischier was considered a top prospect in his draft class and was ranked number two out of North American Skaters. However, Hischier was considered the best overall player by many top NHL scouts, so it wasn’t too surprising when New Jersey selected him first overall in the 2017 NHL Draft.\n Hischier broke the record for highest drafted Swiss player previously held by Niederreiter when he was selected first overall by the Devils in the 2017 NHL draft.\nOther Notable Players.\nThere have been other hockey players of Swiss nationality to have played in the NHL recently and in the past. Some of these include Martin Gerber, Raphael Diaz, Yannick Weber, Luca Sbisa, Reto Berra, Sven Andrighetto, Kevin Fiala, Denis Malgin, Sven Bärtschi, Gaëtan Haas, Dean Kukan, Joel Vermin, Christoph Bertschy, Mirco Müller, Gilles Senn, Calvin Thürkauf and Jonas Siegenthaler."

        "title": "2020 PGA Championship",
        "text": "The 2020 PGA Championship was the 102nd edition of the PGA Championship, and the first of golf's three major championships played in 2020. It was held August 6–9 at TPC Harding Park in San Francisco, California, having originally been scheduled for May 14–17. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was the first major played in over a year, and had no spectators in attendance. It was the first major held at Harding Park, which had previously hosted World Golf Championship events in 2005 and 2015, and the 2009 Presidents Cup.\nIn his PGA Championship debut, and second major appearance, Collin Morikawa won by two strokes ahead of runners-up Paul Casey and Dustin Johnson. Multiple players competed for the lead in the final round, and it was only after a birdie on the 14th, and an eagle on the short par-4 16th, that Morikawa was able to break away from the field. At age 23, he became the third youngest PGA Championship winner since World War II, behind Rory McIlroy and Jack Nicklaus, and rose from 12th to 5th in the Official World Golf Ranking. Morikawa also set a new PGA Championship scoring record for the final 36 holes with 129 strokes (65-64).\nCasey's second place was his best finish in his 64 career major starts, the most by any player since 2002 without a victory. Johnson repeated his second place standing from the previous edition. Brooks Koepka entered the tournament as two-time defending champion and looking to become the second player after Walter Hagen to win three straight titles; tied for fourth place after round three, and only two shots behind the leader, he was expected to challenge for the title, but struggled in the final round and finished in a tie for 29th place. The top three players in the world rankings heading into the tournament were Justin Thomas (winner of a WGC event the previous week), Jon Rahm, and Rory McIlroy, but none of them were able to contend for the title.\nVenue.\nThis was the first major championship held at Harding Park. It was also the first PGA Championship in the Western United States since 1998 at Sahalee Country Club near Seattle, Washington, and the first in California since 1995 at Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles.\nHarding Park had previously held the 2015 WGC-Match Play Championship, won by Rory McIlroy, the 2009 Presidents Cup won by the United States, and the 2005 WGC-American Express Championship won by Tiger Woods.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic up to 40,000 spectators per day had been expected to attend.\nField.\nThe PGA Championship field is regarded as one of the strongest in professional golf, with the highest strength of field rating of the year according to the Official World Golf Ranking, including almost all of the top one hundred players in the rankings. A number of qualification criteria were used to determine the field, including past PGA champions, recent major winners, top finishers in the 2019 PGA Championship, Ryder Cup players, tournament and leading money winners on the PGA Tour, and twenty PGA club or teaching professionals. The PGA of America also issue invitations to players outside of these criteria, which is generally seen to include the top one hundred in the world rankings.\nSeventeen former PGA champions were in the field, including two-time defending champion Brooks Koepka, who was aiming to become the second player to win three in a row after Walter Hagen who won four in a row from 1924 to 1927, world number one Justin Thomas, number three Rory McIlroy, and four-time champion Tiger Woods. Among the former champions not to play were Yang Yong-eun, Pádraig Harrington, John Daly and Vijay Singh, who withdrew due to various concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic, health and injury. Francesco Molinari, winner of the 2018 Open Championship, also withdrew.\nFollowing the cancellation of the 2020 PGA Professional Championship the qualification criteria for PGA club professionals was changed, and determined based on the top 20 in the 2019 PGA Professional Player of the Year Standings; they included 60-year-old Jeff Hart in his fourth PGA Championship, and 62-year old Jeff Roth in his sixth. None of the club professionals made the cut.\nThe field of 156 was completed by PGA of America invitees followed by leading money winners on the PGA Tour since the 2019 championship. Among the invitees was Li Haotong, one of few from outside the top 100 in the world rankings; he went on to lead the championship by two strokes at the halfway stage, before finishing in a tie for seventeenth place. Several players withdrew from the championship, with eleven alternates gaining a place as a result (one alternate, Ryan Moore, also withdrew). Among the withdrawals were leading European players Lee Westwood and Eddie Pepperell who, like Harrington, cited concerns surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and traveling to the United States.\nThe last player to qualify was Richy Werenski, who gained his place by winning the Barracuda Championship the week prior to the PGA Championship, and the final player to take their place in the field was twelfth alternate Alex Norén, who had missed out on automatic qualification as a member of the European Ryder Cup team in 2018 having dropped out of the top 100 in the world rankings.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, August 6, 2020\"\nJason Day, the 2015 champion, opened the tournament with a bogey-free round of 65 (five under par). He was joined at the top of the leaderboard by Brendon Todd, who was playing in his first PGA Championship in five years after falling to as low as 2,043rd in the world rankings two years earlier. Brooks Koepka, looking to become the first player in 93 years to win the PGA Championship for the third straight year, was one of nine players tied for third place at four under par; former major champions Zach Johnson, Martin Kaymer and Justin Rose were also in the group alongside Koepka.\nBryson DeChambeau reached four under through ten holes, but dropped strokes over his last eight holes to finish at two under par. On the same score was 15-time major champion, and four-time PGA champion, Tiger Woods, who was playing alongside world number one Justin Thomas (one over par) and Rory McIlroy (even par).\nThe scoring average for the first round was 71.12, the lowest for an opening-round in PGA Championship history. Todd was the only player in the top 10 to play in the windier afternoon conditions.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, August 7, 2020\"\nLi Haotong, the 114th-ranked player in the world, shot a bogey-free round of 65 (five under par) to take a two stroke lead after 36 holes. Li became the first player from China to lead a major championship after any round. The lowest rounds of the day came from Tommy Fleetwood and Cameron Champ, who returned six under par rounds of 64. Fleetwood finished in a group of six players tied for second place that included two-time defending champion Brooks Koepka, 2015 champion Jason Day and 2013 U.S. Open champion Justin Rose. Champ ended the day a further stroke behind, in a tie for eighth place with Paul Casey and Brendon Todd.\nThe cut came at one over par, with 79 players making it through to the final two rounds over the weekend. Among those who missed the cut were Martin Kaymer and Zach Johnson, who were tied for third place after the opening round; Jim Furyk and Richy Werenski, who had both won tournaments the previous week; and Rickie Fowler, who whiffed a short putt on his sixteenth hole of the day and went on to finish just one stroke outside the cut-line, ending a run of 14 cuts made in major championships.\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, August 8, 2020\"\nDustin Johnson returned a five under par round of 65, the joint-lowest round of the day which included a career high eight birdies for a round in a major championship, to take the lead at nine under par. Scottie Scheffler and Collin Morikawa matched Johnson's score for the day to also make their way into the top five. Scheffler made three straight birdies on holes 15, 16 and 17 to get into a tie for second place with Cameron Champ, one stroke behind Johnson. Morikawa finished a further stroke behind alongside Paul Casey and Brooks Koepka, who was two under par for his round and tied for the lead before making three straight bogeys on the back nine; he rebounded with birdies on two of his final three holes to get back near the top of the leaderboard.\nSix players finished the day tied for seventh place, three strokes off the lead. They were first round leader Jason Day, Daniel Berger, Justin Rose, Tommy Fleetwood, Tony Finau and Bryson DeChambeau. Overnight leader Li Haotong was still at the head of the field through twelve holes; he then made a double-bogey on the 13th hole after losing his ball in the trees and two further bogeys to return a three over par round of 73 and finish in a tie for 13th place, four strokes off the lead.\nSeventeen players were within four shots of the lead going into the final round, the most at the PGA Championship since 1993.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, August 9, 2020\"\nWith the last groups all playing the final nine holes, seven players were tied for the lead at 10 under par – Dustin Johnson, Paul Casey, Scottie Scheffler, Collin Morikawa, Tony Finau, Jason Day and Matthew Wolff, who held the lead in the clubhouse. Morikawa, making his PGA Championship debut, was the first to reach 11 under par with a chip-in for birdie from 54 feet off the front of the green at the 14th hole. He was soon joined by Casey, with a birdie at the short par-4 16th hole. Playing in the group behind Casey, Morikawa found the green with his tee shot at the 16th and holed his putt from seven feet for eagle to open up a two stroke lead. He parred the final two holes for a round of 64 (six under par) and finished at 13 under par for the tournament, two ahead of Casey who also finished with two pars for a round of 66 (four under par).\nJohnson, the 54-hole leader, was even par for his round through 15 holes before chipping in for birdie at the 16th and holing a 17-foot birdie putt at the 18th to finish at 11 under par, alongside Casey and two behind Morikawa. It was Johnson's fifth runner-up finish in a major and second consecutive second-place at the PGA Championship.\nBryson DeChambeau birdied four of his first seven holes to jump into a tie for the lead, before consecutive bogeys on the 8th and 9th holes saw him drop back; he made two more birdies on the back nine for a round of 66 and finished tied for fourth, his first top-10 in a major championship. Wolff, playing in his first major, shared fourth place, having held the clubhouse lead at 10 under par after a round of 65. Day, Finau and Scheffler also finished tied for fourth place. Brooks Koepka, attempting to become the first player since Walter Hagen to win three straight PGA Championships, began the day two shots back but was four over par for the first nine holes and dropped out of contention; he closed with a round of 74, the second-worst of anyone in the field, to tie for 29th place.\nMorikawa's score of 129 on the weekend was a new PGA Championship record, one shot better than Tiger Woods in 2018. His final-round score of 64 tied Steve Elkington in 1995 for best by a champion. He was also the ninth player in PGA Championship history to win the tournament at their first attempt, the most recent being Keegan Bradley in 2011.\nFinal leaderboard.\n\"Note: Top 15 and ties qualify for the 2021 PGA Championship; top 4 and ties qualify for the 2021 Masters Tournament\"\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nMedia.\nESPN and CBS had the media rights to the 2020 PGA Championship. This marked the first year of the new media rights deal signed in October 2018, replacing the old deal with TNT and CBS. In the UK and Ireland, Sky Sports broadcast the event."

        "title": "2020 U.S. Open (golf)",
        "text": "The 2020 United States Open Championship was the 120th U.S. Open, held September 17–20 over the West Course at Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, New York, a suburb northeast of New York City. Originally scheduled for June 18–21, the championship was postponed three months due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was played without spectators. It was the first U.S. Open held in September in 107 years.\nBryson DeChambeau won his first major title with a six-under-par 274. His final round 67 (−3) was three strokes better than the rest of the field and turned a two-stroke deficit into a six-stroke victory margin over runner-up Matthew Wolff, the 54-hole leader who shot 75. In his five previous U.S. Opens, DeChambeau's best result was a tie for fifteenth. The 21-year-old Wolff was attempting to become the youngest U.S. Open champion since Bobby Jones in 1923 and the first to win in his U.S. Open debut since amateur Francis Ouimet in 1913.\nCourse.\nIt was the sixth time the U.S. Open had been held on West Course at Winged Foot, regarded as one of the toughest courses in major championship golf. Previously in 2006, Geoff Ogilvy won with a five-over-par 285; and Hale Irwin won with 287 (+7) in 1974, later dubbed the \"Massacre at Winged Foot.\"\nThe A. W. Tillinghast designed course underwent renovations starting in 2017 under the guidance of architect Gil Hanse, with the overall length being increased and the designated par of the 5th and 9th holes being switched from the last time it hosted the U.S. Open; the 5th becoming a par 4 and the 9th a par 5.\nLengths of the course for previous majors:\nField.\nNormally, about half the field qualifies for the U.S. Open via local and sectional qualifying. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020, the entire field consisted of players who were exempt from qualifying. The revised exemption criteria were announced on June 25. Existing exemptions were retained and the field was reduced from 156 to 144. Among several changes to exemption criteria, additional places were awarded based on performances in tournaments on the PGA and European tours, and many other spots were filled from various ranking and money lists with cut-off dates nearer the rescheduled tournament dates.\nTen past U.S. Open champions were in the field. They were Lucas Glover, world number one Dustin Johnson, Martin Kaymer, Graeme McDowell, Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose, Webb Simpson, Jordan Spieth, defending champion Gary Woodland, and three-time winner Tiger Woods. 2017 and 2018 champion Brooks Koepka did not play due to injury.\nRule changes.\nDue to a rule change, the U.S. Amateur champion no longer forfeits his U.S. Open exemption if he turns professional.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, September 17, 2020\"\n2017 PGA Champion and world number three Justin Thomas returned a five-under-par round of 65, the lowest round ever recorded in a U.S. Open at Winged Foot, to take the first round lead. One stroke behind were Thomas Pieters, Matthew Wolff, and 2018 Masters champion Patrick Reed, who made a hole-in-one on the par-3 seventh hole.\nLouis Oosthuizen played his final nine holes in five under par to join Lee Westwood and 2011 U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy in a tie for fifth place at three under par; Oosthuizen's round was his eighth time shooting 67 or better at the U.S. Open, a new tournament record. Six players tied at two under par, three strokes off the lead.\nThe scoring average for the first round was 72.56, the second-lowest for a first round in U.S. Open history behind 1993. Twenty-one players finished the round under par; just twelve under-par rounds were completed during the entire tournament the last time the U.S. Open was held at Winged Foot in 2006.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, September 18, 2020\"\nPatrick Reed made five birdies and five bogeys in an even-par round of 70 to take the 36-hole lead at four-under par. Bryson DeChambeau hit his second shot on the par-5 9th hole, his final hole of the day, to six feet and converted the eagle putt to return a two-under-par round of 68, the lowest round of the day, and move into second place, one stroke behind Reed. Overnight leader Justin Thomas made four bogeys in his first eight holes and a double-bogey on the 1st, his 10th, before finishing with two birdies to return a three-over-par round of 73 to tie for third place alongside Harris English and Rafa Cabrera-Bello.\nJason Kokrak followed an opening round 68 with a one-over par 71 to sit alone in 6th place at one under par, three strokes off the lead. A stroke further behind were Hideki Matsuyama (69), Xander Schauffele (72), Brendon Todd (72), Thomas Pieters (74) and Matthew Wolff (74). After starting with a birdie, Rory McIlroy made seven bogeys, a double-bogey and just two further birdies to finish at six over par for the day and three over par for the tournament. A day after 21 players completed under-par rounds, windier conditions contributed to just three (DeChambeau, Matsuyama, and Bubba Watson) managing to do so in the second round.\nThe 36-hole cut came at 146 (six-over par). Among the players to miss the cut were three-time champion Tiger Woods, defending champion Gary Woodland, PGA Champion Collin Morikawa, Phil Mickelson, Tommy Fleetwood, and former U.S. Open champions Jordan Spieth, Justin Rose, Graeme McDowell, and Martin Kaymer. John Pak, a senior at Florida State, was the only amateur to make the cut.\nAmateurs: \"Pak (+5)\", Kanaya (+7), Thompson (+7), Ogletree (+8), Augenstein (+9), Scott (+9), Summerhays (+9), Yu (+10), Hammer (+11), Castillo (+12), Michel (+17), Sugrue (+17), Rousaud (+21)\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, September 19, 2020\"\nMatthew Wolff, making his U.S. Open debut, began the round four strokes off the lead but quickly made up that deficit with five birdies on the front nine. He did not make a bogey until the 16th hole, despite hitting just two of 14 fairways, and closed the round with a 10-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole for a five-under-par round of 65, the lowest round of the day, and a two-stroke lead. At 21, Wolff was the youngest 54-hole leader at the U.S. Open since amateur Jim Simons in 1971.\nBryson DeChambeau bogeyed his first two holes before playing his next 15 in three under par to get within one stroke of Wolff; however, he finished with a bogey on the 18th hole to end the day at three under par, two off the lead. Louis Oosthuizen was the only other player under par after the third round; a two-under-par round of 68, which included three birdies on the back-nine, left him four strokes behind Wolff at one under par. Harris English (72), Hideki Matsuyama (70), and Xander Schauffele (70) were tied for fourth place at even par.\nSecond-round leader Patrick Reed built a three-stroke advantage with a birdie at the second hole. After nine holes, he retained a share of the lead with Wolff, but he played the back nine in eight over par to tie for 11th place, eight strokes off the lead. After falling away with a second round 76, Rory McIlroy got back into contention at one over par with one of only seven under-par rounds during the day, a two-under-par 68.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, September 20, 2020\"\nSummary.\nStarting the final round two strokes behind, Bryson DeChambeau took the lead on the fifth hole as overnight leader Matthew Wolff made his second bogey of the day. At the par-5 9th hole, both players were on the green in two strokes; after DeChambeau had made a 39-foot putt for an eagle, Wolff was able to match it by holing his putt from ten feet to remain just a stroke behind going into the last nine holes.\nAt the par-3 10th hole Wolff hit his tee shot into thick rough lining a greenside bunker and was unable to get up and down. DeChambeau then increased his lead to three strokes at the next hole, the par-4 11th, by holing his birdie putt from just off the green. Wolff fell six strokes behind after making another bogey at the 14th hole followed by a double-bogey at the 16th, as DeChambeau recorded a run of pars. Two more pars for DeChambeau, including a seven-foot putt on the 18th, gave him a six-stroke victory.\nDeChambeau's three-under-par round of 67 was the best of the day by three shots. He was the only player not to shoot over par in any round, despite hitting just 23 of 56 fairways for the week, the fewest by a U.S. Open champion since at least 1981. He also joined Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods as the only players to win the U.S. Amateur, an NCAA title, and the U.S. Open. It was Wolff's second top-5 finish in just his second major championship.\nIn third place was Louis Oosthuizen at two over par. Harris English was a stroke further back in fourth place, his best finish and first top-ten in a major championship. Xander Schauffele extended his run of finishing in the top 10 of each U.S. Open he has played, securing fifth place on his own with a birdie on the 18th hole. World number one Dustin Johnson finished at five over par alongside Korn Ferry Tour qualifier Will Zalatoris in sixth place. Tied for eighth place at six over par were Tony Finau and four former major winners: Zach Johnson, Justin Thomas, Webb Simpson, and Rory McIlroy, whose challenge effectively ended with a four-putt double-bogey on the first hole and two further bogeys on the opening holes.\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nMedia.\nOn June 29, 2020, it was announced that Fox Sports had opted out of the remaining seven years of its 12-year contract to carry USGA championships and had sold the remainder of the contract to NBCUniversal—marking the return of the U.S. Open to NBC for the first time since 2014. The rescheduling of the tournament had created conflicts with Fox's NFL and college football coverage, and the USGA declined a proposal for the entirety of the tournament to be carried on Fox's cable channel FS1 instead. Fox discussed the possibility of partnering with NBC on the 2020 tournament, but this eventually \"led to a broader conversation and eventual agreement for NBCUniversal to take over the USGA media rights\".\nEarly-round coverage aired on Golf Channel; Peacock carried featured groups coverage of the early rounds. Per a sponsorship agreement with Rolex, the final hour of coverage during the final round was broadcast with no commercial interruptions.\nThe 2020 edition of the U.S. Open featured a total of 43.5 hours of coverage, made up of 11.5 hours on each of Thursday and Friday, 10.5 hours on Saturday, and 10 hours on Sunday. Golf Channel carried a total of 15 hours of coverage: 6.5 hours on each of Thursday and Friday and 2 hours on Sunday; NBC had a total of 20.5 hours of coverage: 3 hours on each of Thursday and Friday, 8.5 hours on Saturday, and 6 hours on Sunday; Peacock streamed 2 hours of coverage each day."

        "title": "PBA Tour Playoffs",
        "text": "The PBA Tour Playoffs is an annual invitational event on the PBA Tour in North America that debuted in the . After two years as a 24-player tournament, the event was set up in a 16-player bracket-style format since 2021.\nTournament Structure.\nPBA Tour Playoffs participants are chosen and seeded based on points earned in qualifying to-date tournaments of the current season. (For 2019, this included 13 events, from the PBA Hall of Fame Classic through the USBC Masters; for 2020, this included 12 events due to the cancellation of the USBC Masters.) PBA Tour points are awarded on a tier system, as follows:\nFor 2019 and 2020, the top eight players in points received byes into the second round (round of 16). The #9 through #24 seeds competed in single-elimination matches (one standard ten-frame game each) to determine who advanced to the second round.\nFor 2019, Round 2 and all subsequent rounds featured double-elimination matches, also known as the \"race to two points\". Any player winning both games in a match earns two points and advances to the next round. If the match is split one game each, the players bowl a 9th/10th frame roll-off to determine who wins the second point and the right to advance. If the 9th/10th frame roll-off results in a tie, a one-ball, sudden death roll-off is used until a winner is determined. For 2020, only the championship finals used the race to two points format. All other rounds were single-elimination matches.\nThe PBA Players Committee originally voted to make the playoffs a non-title event, citing the low number of games bowled as the primary reason. However, on December 6, 2019, the PBA announced that the winner of the 2019 PBA Playoffs would retroactively be awarded a PBA Tour title, and that the winner of the 2020 PBA Playoffs and subsequent events will be credited with a PBA title. As of 2020, winners also receive a WWE championship belt, as part of a cross-promotion with WWE wrestling, which is also broadcast on Fox Sports (current home of the PBA).\nSince 2021, the PBA Playoffs feature a 16-player field rather than a 24-player field. All PBA Playoffs matches are double-elimination (\"race to two points\") except for the final match, which uses a \"race to three points\" format. Players bowl a maximum of four games, with the first player to win three games earning the championship. If the match is split two games each, the players bowl a 9th/10th frame roll-off for the third point and the title.\nIn 2024, the PBA Playoffs has a 16-player starting field, with the 12 through 16 seeds competing in a separate stepladder event to qualify for the #12 seed. The 5 through 11 seeds are then joined by the #12 seed in a bracketed round of eight. The top four seeds automatically gain entry into the quarterfinal round of eight, facing the four survivors of the 5 through 12 brackets. Elimination brackets then continue until a champion is crowned.\nTournament history.\n2024 event.\n16-player field based on 2024 PBA Tour points through April 28. $300,000 prize fund.\nPlay-in round.\nHeld May 4 in Arlington, Washington.\nStepladder match 1: #16 A.

Carapaz, along with Brandon McNulty of the United States, attacked with to go and immediately built a gap over the chasing group. Both riders worked together until Carapaz dropped McNulty with to go. Carapaz held off the chase group to win the race by more than a minute. The silver and bronze medals went to Wout van Aert of Belgium and Tadej Pogačar of Slovenia, respectively. Both riders were part of the 11-man chase group that rode in pursuit of Carapaz and McNulty. Eight of the 11 riders contested the sprint for the silver medal, with van Aert holding off Pogačar to take second.\nBackground.\nThis was the 21st appearance of the event, initially held in 1896 and then at every Summer Olympics since 1936. It replaced the individual time trial event that had been held from 1912 to 1932; the time trial was re-introduced in 1996 alongside the road race.\nQualification.\nA National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to five qualified cyclists in the men's individual road race. All quota places are assigned to the NOC, which may select the cyclists that compete. There were 130 total quota spots available for the race, which were allocated in a multi-step process:\nFinally, both Simon Geschke of Germany and Michal Schlegel of the Czech Republic did not start the race after testing positive for COVID-19 the day before the race.\nCompetition format and course.\nThe road race was a mass-start, one-day road race event. The courses for the men's and women's road races were revealed in August 2018. The men's race started at Musashinonomori Park in Chōfu, western Tokyo, at 11:00 Japan Standard Time (UTC+9) and finished at the Fuji Speedway circuit in the Shizuoka prefecture. The race was long with a total elevation gain of .\nThe first part of the men's and women's races were identical. The course first passed through the mostly flat outskirts of Tokyo's metropolitan area. After , the riders gradually climbed towards the foot of the climb to Doushi Road, a climb with an average gradient of 5.7 percent. The climb topped out after of racing at an altitude of above sea level. After reaching Lake Yamanakako in Yamanashi and crossing the Kagosaka Pass, the riders faced a descent and from here, the courses were different for the men's and women's races.\nAfter the descent, the men's race headed towards the lower slopes of Mount Fuji, Japan's highest mountain, where they went up the long climb of Fuji Sanroku with an average incline of six percent. The climb was crested with left at an elevation of before the riders faced a long descent into Gotemba. Afterwards, the riders headed towards the Fuji Speedway section, where they crossed the finish line twice before reaching the foot of the Mikuni Pass. The climb was long with an average gradient of 10.6 percent and included sections reaching 20 percent. It was expected to be the decisive climb in the race. The peak, at an altitude of , was crested with about to go. After the climb, the race returned to Lake Yamanakako and the Kagosaka Pass before a final descent and a short hilly section towards the finish on the Fuji Speedway circuit.\nStart list.\nNations:\nRace overview.\nAs soon as the race started, a group of eight riders broke away from the peloton. The group comprised Nicholas Dlamini (South Africa), Michael Kukrle (Czech Republic), Juraj Sagan (Slovakia), Polychronis Tzortzakis (Greece), Eduard-Michael Grosu (Romania), Orluis Aular (Venezuela), Paul Daumont (Burkina Faso), and Elchin Asadov (Azerbaijan). The break reached a maximum advantage of around 19 minutes before the peloton began its pursuit, with defending Olympic champion Greg Van Avermaet (Belgium) and Jan Tratnik (Slovenia), in particular, leading the chase. On the gradual uphill section ahead of the climb to Doushi Road, Tristan de Lange (Namibia) attacked from the peloton but he was eventually caught. With around to go, a crash took place in the peloton, taking down the Great Britain duo of Geraint Thomas and Tao Geoghegan Hart as well as Giulio Ciccone (Italy) and Gregor Mühlberger (Austria). All riders eventually managed to get back up and return to the peloton. Up front, the break was reduced to five riders Aular, Dlamini, Tzortzakis, Kukrle, and Sagan after the first climb. The group led the peloton by around 16 minutes.\nAs the race reached the foot of Fuji Sanroku, Van Avermaet and Tratnik continued to lead the chase as the break started the climb with a lead of around minutes. Patrick Bevin (New Zealand) went to the front to help with the chase and the break's lead gradually decreased as the climb went on while further up the ascent, Van Avermaet began to get dropped along with several other riders. Near the top, Ciccone took over at the front of the peloton to set a faster tempo. Some of the notable riders to struggle on the climb include the Spanish duo of Omar Fraile and Alejandro Valverde. The break reached the top of Fuji Sanroku with a lead of almost six minutes. Tratnik soon made his way back to the front of the peloton to gradually eat into the break's advantage, with the break reaching the Fuji Speedway with a lead of around four minutes. At the start of the circuit, several riders began to abandon the race, most notably Thomas, Van Avermaet and Fraile.\nAfter the first passage through the finish line, attacks lit up the peloton as Damiano Caruso (Italy), Wilco Kelderman (Netherlands), and Mauri Vansevenant (Belgium) rode away. After the three riders were caught, Remco Evenepoel (Belgium) instigated another attack and brought Vincenzo Nibali (Italy) and Eddie Dunbar (Ireland) with him. Meanwhile, up front, the break began to splinter as Sagan and Dlamini couldn't continue with the quick pace and the peloton edged closer to them. The trio of Evenepoel, Nibali, and Dunbar was soon brought back. As the race reached the Fuji Speedway for the second time, the remnants of the original break were finally caught, with the peloton setting themselves up for the decisive climb of the race, the Mikuni Pass.\nAs the peloton reached the foot of the Mikuni Pass, Italy stationed themselves up front before Tiesj Benoot (Belgium) began to set a furious pace. After Benoot's work was done, his compatriot Vansevenant continued to set a fast tempo as the peloton continued to thin out. With around to go, Tadej Pogačar (Slovenia) put in a seated acceleration. Brandon McNulty (United States) and Michael Woods (Canada) followed his move while Wout van Aert (Belgium) led the chase group. The trio led by around 20 seconds before riders began to bridge up front. Near the top, the front group struggled with cooperation as the group including van Aert managed to make it across. As the group made its way back to Lake Yamanakako and the Kagosaka Pass, several riders attacked off the front. Bauke Mollema (Netherlands) and Jakob Fuglsang (Denmark) tried to initiate some attacks but the moves were brought back.\nWith to go, Brandon McNulty accelerated off the front with Richard Carapaz (Ecuador) responding to the move. The duo began to increase their advantage as the chase group suffered from a lack of cooperation, with van Aert leading much of the chase. The duo's advantage reached more than 40 seconds before van Aert produced a searing acceleration on a short uphill rise with around to go. The lead was soon down to 13 seconds with to go. With left, Carapaz dropped McNulty to solo off the front. After McNulty was caught by the chase group, the riders continued to attack each other, allowing Carapaz to increase his lead once again. Carapaz would not be caught as he won the gold medal, his country's second in history. With gold already taken, the chase group set themselves up for the sprint for the silver and bronze medals, resulting in an 8-way race for the finish in the final metres of the race, which was initiated by Adam Yates (Great Britain). Van Aert and Pogačar prevailed in the sprint, taking silver and bronze respectively. The gap between second and ninth places was within a single second."

        "title": "Cycling at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Women's individual road race",
        "text": "The women's individual road race event at the 2020 Summer Olympics was held on 25 July 2021 on a course starting at Musashinonomori Park in Tokyo and ending at the Fuji Speedway in Shizuoka Prefecture. 67 cyclists from 40 nations competed, with 48 completing the course.\nThe race was won by rank outsider Anna Kiesenhofer of Austria. Kiesenhofer was part of the original breakaway, powering away at the very start of the race along with four other riders. She proceeded to drop her breakaway companions, all of whom were swallowed up by the peloton, soloing off the front at the Kagosaka Pass with to go and holding off the late chase from the pack. She won by 1' 15\" over the silver medalist, Annemiek van Vleuten of the Netherlands.\nVan Vleuten made a late attack with to go, distancing the remnants of the peloton. She celebrated after crossing the line, having mistakenly thought that all the breakaway riders had been caught and that she had won gold. The bronze medal went to Elisa Longo Borghini of Italy, after unsuccessfully attempting to bridge up to van Vleuten's attack and holding off the peloton.\nThe Olympic road races are unusual in the modern professional circuit in the complete absence of team radios, an anomaly which, together with Kiesenhofer's relative anonymity in the peloton, factored heavily into the shock outcome of the 2021 race. Approaching the line, the peloton appeared unaware that the unheralded Kiesenhofer had been one of the escapees, had stayed off the front and finished the race substantially ahead of them.\nKiesenhofer's win was considered a huge upset; she had trained for the event without a coach or a professional team, and was not viewed as a meaningful contender to win a medal. Her solo victory was described as one of the biggest upsets in Olympics history.\nBackground.\nThis was the 10th appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1984. The reigning Olympic champion was Anna van der Breggen of the Netherlands.\nQualification.\nA National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to four qualified cyclists in the women's individual road race. All quota places are assigned to the NOC, which may select the cyclists that compete. There were 67 total quota spots available for the race. The assignments of spots to NOCs was a multi-stage process:\nCompetition format and course.\nThe road race was a mass-start, one-day road race event. The courses for the men's and women's road races were revealed in August 2018. The women's race started at Musashinonomori Park in Chōfu, western Tokyo, at 13:00 Japan Standard Time (UTC+9) and finished at the Fuji Speedway circuit in the Shizuoka prefecture. The women's road race was long with a total elevation gain of .\nThe first part of the men's and women's races were identical. The course first passed through the mostly flat outskirts of Tokyo's metropolitan area. After , the riders gradually climbed towards the foot of the climb to Doushi Road, a climb with an average gradient of 5.7 percent. The climb topped out after of racing at an altitude of above sea level. After reaching Lake Yamanakako in Yamanashi and crossing the Kagosaka Pass, the riders faced a descent and from here, the courses were different for the men's and women's races. Following the descent, the women's race made their way towards the Fuji Speedway circuit, bypassing the climbs of Fuji Sanroku and the Mikuni Pass. The riders contested one and a half laps of the undulating track before crowning the winner at the Fuji Speedway.\nStart list.\nNations:\nRace overview.\nAs soon as the racing started, Anna Kiesenhofer (Austria) attacked from the peloton. She was soon joined by Carla Oberholzer (South Africa), Vera Looser (Namibia), Omer Shapira (Israel), and Anna Plichta (Poland). Several riders attempted to bridge to the front but they were caught by the peloton. The break was considered unthreatening, and was allowed to build a maximum advantage of around 11 minutes over the favourites before the gap was stabilized. As the road began to go uphill, Looser struggled to follow the pace in the break and she began to drop back. With to go, Oberholzer also lost contact with her breakaway companions as three riders were left at the front. The trio up front managed to maintain their gap over the peloton as no teams were willing to take up the chase behind, leaning on the extremely strong Netherlands team who likewise failed to pursue. As the peloton neared the foot of the climb to Doushi Road, Emma Norsgaard Jørgensen (Denmark)'s wheel aligned with an expansion joint in the road causing her to lose control and crash. Annemiek van Vleuten (Netherlands) could not evade the fallen rider and went head over, both bicycles becoming entangled. Both riders eventually got back up.\nWith around to go, Demi Vollering (Netherlands) attacked from the peloton, sparking a flurry of attacks. However, all the moves were eventually covered while the break still enjoyed a lead of around eight and a half minutes. On the climb to Doushi Road, the lead began to come down as the pace in the peloton started to shed riders out the back. Around from the finish, van Vleuten made another attack, this time building a gap over the peloton. At this point, the gap to the break up front still stood at around five and a half minutes. Van Vleuten managed to increase her lead to a minute over the peloton while up front, on the Kagosaka Pass, Kiesenhofer dropped Shapira and Plichta, going solo with still left to race. Kiesenhofer maintained her five-minute advantage over van Vleuten on the descent from the Kagosaka Pass while the peloton was a further minute in arrears. As Kiesenhofer ended the descent, she still held a lead of four and a half minutes over the peloton. A few moments later, Juliette Labous (France) attacked from the peloton and gained a lead of around 20 seconds.\nKiesenhofer soon passed through the finish line at the Fuji Speedway for the first time with to go, holding a lead of two minutes over Shapira and Plichta, almost four minutes over Labous, and more than four minutes over the peloton. At this point, Netherlands began to set a faster pace, bringing back Labous and closing in on Shapira and Plichta. With left, both Shapira and Plichta were finally caught by the peloton; at this point, some of the riders, not having radios as is common in road cycling outside the Olympics, thought that all the breakaway riders had been caught, when in reality Kiesenhofer was still leading by three minutes. from the finish, van Vleuten attacked from the peloton, with Elisa Longo Borghini (Italy) going after her. However, van Vleuten continued to maintain her gap over Longo Borghini while up front, but not catching the lone leader. Kiesenhofer soloed to the biggest win of her career, winning the gold medal.\nVan Vleuten went on to take the silver medal. She celebrated as she crossed the line, thinking that she won the gold medal. There was controversy afterward because during the race, without radio communication, the organisation had not informed riders properly that Kiesenhofer was in the lead, or by how far. Longo Borghini held on to take the bronze medal."

        "title": "Pennant Hills Golf Club",
        "text": "The Pennant Hills Golf Club is a golf club in Beecroft, New South Wales, Australia, a suburb of Sydney. Founded in 1923, it is a par 71 eighteen-hole championship course. It has hosted many amateur events including the NSW Men's and NSW Ladies Amateur Championships. In 1925, the original clubhouse was designed by Thomas Pollard Sampson, a playing member of the club, and he extended the building in 1929 and again in 1939.\nHistory.\nThe club was incorporated on 26 February 1923 when it completed the purchase of an area of land of 97 acres, 1 rood and 24 ½ perches, paying £4750 to Mr J.W Meader for the land previously secured by Robert Vicars.\nAn initial course layout in 1923 included 9 holes on the western end which had previously been cleared for farming and cultivation. The remainder of the course was covered with hundreds of trees and stumps, water holes, and rock shelves which required removal before an 18-hole course could be completed.\nThe course was extended to an 18-hole course over the next year following advice provided by Professional Golfer, Tom Howard, the then holder of the Australian Open, NSW and Australian PGA Titles, He was paid a fee of £1/1-.\nThe first 18-hole layout was played in March 1924. Over subsequent years, the layout was changed until a final layout in 1934, which opened on 17 March 1934.\nLayout and signature holes.\nApart from the initial course layout in 1923/24 designed with the advice of Tom Howard, the subsequent course design was mostly done by club members. There was no master layout for the course, which evolved through five progressive layouts from 1924 to 1934. Each layout was enabled by the clearing of trees, which provided areas for new fairways and greens and lengthening of existing holes to achieve a course of championship length. When considering changes to the 16th hole in 1936 to create a dog-leg, Eric Apperly, then Australian Amateur Champion. was asked to provide a design.\nAlso in 1952 when the 9th green was reconstructed requiring excavation into the sandstone cliff behind, the advice of Australian Open Champion 1950/52/53, Norman Von Nida was sought.\nIn laying out the course, the design took advantage of the often steep hilly contours of the site, as well as the many stands of old growth trees and the deep gully carrying Devlins Creek through the eastern end of the course, ensuring there are few even lies. There are favourable comparisons with Augusta National with respect to the steepness of some holes.\nThe deep gully, only in front of the clubhouse, allowed the starting and finishing holes for each nine, to require a carry across the deep gully between trees to either a rising fairway for 1 and 10, or to greens close to the clubhouse for 9 and 18.\nThe first hole is a par four, across the gully to an elevated tree-lined fairway with a slight dog-leg before undulations to an elevated green. The remaining front nine holes follow a sequence around the perimeter, making features of the trees and undulations, before the par three 9th hole crosses the deep gully from an elevated tee to a green cut from the rocky cliff on the other side. In 1927, the hole (then the 11th) was described as \"hole is of the Spion Kop type, requiring a mashie shot over a creek, where again accuracy and distance must be attained to avoid severe penalties.\"\nThe 10th par four again provides a carry across the deep gully from an elevated tee, between tall trees to a steadily rising fairway and an elevated green. The remaining back nine are tree lined, with four dog-leg holes either downhill or uphill, to mainly small greens protected by bunkers. The 15th is a feature hole of only par four, but from a very elevated tee, to a steep uphill tree lined fairway and small green, with heavy fairway and greenside bunkers. The hole was twice driven during the 1982 club championships match-play by Greg Wicks only to lose to a chip-in eagle in the first round by his opponent, the legendary Tony Gresham and halved in birdies in the second round.\nThe par three 18th finishing hole is a long carry across the gully, through a narrow chute between tall eucalypts, to a steep fairway immediately below an elevated green. Early reports of the hole describe the 18th \"between the tee and the green is a ‘great gulf’ ; an easy three or a bad twenty.\"\nHeritage listing.\nIn July 1994, the course was given heritage listing stating, \"Golf course sited on undulating topography above Devlins Creek which runs through site. Conserving large stands of mature indigenous Eucalypts particularly Blackbutts, Bluegums and Stringybarks to between fairways. There are also indigenous trees around boundary and on nature strips including Blackbutt, Smoothbark, Angophora, Stringybarks, and Turpentines to high.\"\nWater Recycling treatment plant.\nIn the early 2000s NSW experienced an extended drought which resulted in rapid lowering of the levels of water storage within the dams in the Sydney region. In November 2002, storage was at 65% and by April 2003, the storage level had dropped to 59%. The NSW State Government mandated that when levels were at 55%, restrictions on water usage would be introduced, initially targeting house hold use, but progressing to business, and Local Government Councils.\nForeshadowing the likely impact of the use of Water for Tees, Greens and Fairways on the golf course, the Pennant Hills Golf Club initiated a program to improve water security through the use of recycled sewerage effluent which could be extracted from a Sewer main running underneath part of the course.\nCommencing in June 2003, initial meetings were held with Sydney Water and Hornsby Shire Council involving agreement by Sydney Water for long term exclusive extraction rights of effluent carried by the Sewer main, and agreement from the NSW Environmental Protection Agency, to protect the local environment, population and waterways. The project was a ‘first’ for these agencies, which resulted in an extended approval process. The project was completed and officially opened in May 2008.\nDescription of WRP process.\nKey elements include a sewerage off-take well in Devlin's Creek, 3 large storage tanks, and the main plant consisting of a balance tank plus 2 processing tanks (one biological and one membrane) as well as a pumping room and computerized control system within a shed. Effluent is extracted from the sewer line in Devlin's Creek, pumped to the balance tank and then put through biological processes in anoxic and aerobic conditions, before final filtering using a high tech membrane process. It then undergoes UV treatment and chlorination before going into the storage tanks. The plant provides between 500 and 650 kilolitres per day of class A water suitable for irrigation with uncontrolled public access (15 to 19 million litres per month).\nThe treated water contains significant levels of nitrogen and other nutrients which has reduced the requirement for use of artificial fertilisers on the course.\nCourse Records.\nMen.\n1952 - Set by Kel Nagle on 22 Nov 1952 in his third round of the NSW PGA Championships. His score of 63 set the course record for the course of , par 71.\n1968 - Set by Tony Gresham on 13 July 1968 in a stroke round.

        "text": "John Herbert Best (born March 27, 1971) is an American former professional basketball player. A forward/center listed at 6-foot-8, he played college basketball at Tennessee Tech for 4 years, and in his senior year he ranked 3rd in the NCAA Division I in scoring with an average of 28.5 points per game. He was selected by the New Jersey Nets in the second round of the 1993 NBA draft (36th overall), but he was cut before the beginning of the 1993–94 NBA season and started his professional career in France. After playing in Puerto Rico, Switzerland and the Philippines, Best joined German team Bayer Giants Leverkusen where he was the Basketball Bundesliga Top Scorer in 2001 with an average of 22.9 points per game. He then participated in the 2003–04 Euroleague with Alba Berlin and retired after three more seasons in France with Élan Chalon.\nHigh school career.\nBest grew up in Neptune, New Jersey and then moved to Memphis, Tennessee with his family in 1987, before his junior year of high school. While being at Neptune High School he had not played in the varsity basketball team; he later had a 6 inches growth spurt and when at Whitehaven High School in Memphis he played two years in the varsity team. In his senior season at Whitehaven he averaged 21.1 points, 9.7 rebounds and 3.1 blocks per game.\nCollege career.\nBest signed for Tennessee Tech in April 1989. He wasn't cleared to play until November because his old high school in New Jersey had not given a final certification for a science course taken in the 9th grade: after the school provided the certification, Best became eligible. While at Tennessee Tech he chose to wear number 25 and he played mostly center during his college career. In his freshman season he played 15 games (no starts) and averaged 3.1 points, 1.7 rebounds and 0.1 assists per game, receiving limited playing time; he also won the Golden Eagle Award given by Tennessee Tech every year to players who showed \"sacrifice, dedication and hard work\": he received the award together with his teammate Mitch Cupples. After the graduation of forward Earl Wise, the 1989–90 top scorer at Tennessee Tech, coach Frank Harrell gave Best a spot in the starting lineup, and he led the team during his sophomore season, recording a team-best 13.9 points per game. In a preseason game on November 23, 1990 against Bethel he recorded a then career-high 32 points. Best went on to average 5.3 rebounds (second on the team behind Jerome Rodgers) and 0.9 steals (second behind Van Usher).\nBest's junior season saw him start 27 out of 29 games, averaging 32 minutes per game and record a team-leading 20 points per game. His 7 rebounds per game placed him second behind Charles Edmondson, and he ranked third in steals behind Usher and Edmondson. At the end of the season he was an All-OVC selection, as he ranked third in the entire conference in scoring behind Division I scoring champion Brett Roberts and Popeye Jones. Best was named team capitain for his senior year. On December 12, 1992 in a game against Southern Mississippi he recorded a new career-high of 36 points; on January 9, 1993 against Eastern Kentucky he improved his career best with 38 points, and equalled it on January 30 against Murray State. He recorded his career-high of 42 points playing against Morehead State on February 22, 1993. He led the NCAA in 2-point field goals with 292, led the OVC in total points (799, also an all-time record for Tennessee Tech) and points per game (28.5), which also ranked him 3rd in the entire Division I and 2nd all-time in Tennessee Tech history behind Jimmy Hagan's 1958–59 season (28.8). At the end of the 1992–93 season he was named in the All-OVC team, NABC All-Region and All-District teams, and in the \"Basketball Weekly\" All-Region team.\nHe ranks 4th all-time for points scored at Tennessee Tech with 1,773 in 97 games.\nIn 2018, he was named an OVC basketball legend.\nProfessional career.\nAfter the end of his senior season, Best was automatically eligible for the 1993 NBA draft, during which he was selected by the New Jersey Nets with the 9th pick in the second round (36th overall).

It was the 106th edition of the Rose Bowl Game, and one of the 2019–20 bowl games concluding the 2019 FBS football season. Sponsored by the Northwestern Mutual financial services organization, the game was officially known as the Rose Bowl Game presented by Northwestern Mutual, and was a rematch of the 2012 Rose Bowl, which Oregon also won. Wisconsin made it to their first Rose Bowl since 2013; the game marked the Badgers' fourth consecutive Rose Bowl loss, having lost three straight times from 2011 to 2013.\nTeams.\nThe game matched Big Ten Conference runner-up Wisconsin and Pac-12 Conference champion Oregon. The 2012 Rose Bowl featured the same teams, won by Oregon, who scored 10 unanswered fourth-quarter points in a 45–38 victory.\nOregon Ducks.\nOregon entered the game with an 11–2 record (8–1 in conference). They finished atop the Pac-12's North Division, then defeated Utah in the Pac-12 Championship Game to secure their spot in the Rose Bowl. Oregon was 2–1 against ranked FBS opponents, defeating Washington and Utah while losing to Auburn. The Ducks' only other loss was to Arizona State. This was Oregon's eighth Rose Bowl; they had a 3–4 record in prior appearances, last playing in the 2015 edition, which they won over Florida State.\nWisconsin Badgers.\nWisconsin entered the game with a 10–3 record (7–2 in conference). They finished tied with Minnesota atop the Big Ten's West Division, and advanced to the Big Ten Championship Game due to their regular season win over Minnesota. In the Big Ten title game, the Badgers fell to Ohio State, 34–21. As Ohio State was selected for the College Football Playoff, Wisconsin received an invitation to the Rose Bowl. The Badgers were 3–2 against ranked opponents, defeating Michigan, Iowa, and Minnesota while losing to Ohio State twice. Their only other loss was to Illinois. This was Wisconsin's tenth Rose Bowl; they had a 3–6 record in prior appearances, last playing in the 2013 edition, which they lost to Stanford.\nGame summary.\nStatistics.\nSome controversy arose from an offensive pass interference call that went against Wisconsin near the end of the game, which nullified a Wisconsin first down and eventually gave the ball back to Oregon, who was able to run the clock down and win the game. The call and its impact on the game led former NFL referee Terry McAulay to publicly disagree with the call."

For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots based on the following principles (Regulations Article 13.06):\nOn 17 July 2014, the UEFA emergency panel ruled that Ukrainian and Russian clubs would not be drawn against each other \"until further notice\" due to the political unrest between the countries.\nMoreover, for associations with two or more teams, teams were paired in order to split them into two sets of four groups (A–D, E–H) for maximum television coverage. The following pairings were announced by UEFA after the group stage teams were confirmed:\nOn each matchday, one set of four groups played their matches on Tuesday, while the other set of four groups played their matches on Wednesday, with the two sets of groups alternating between each matchday. The fixtures were decided after the draw, using a computer draw not shown to public, with the following match sequence (Regulations Article 16.02):\n\"Note: Positions for scheduling do not use the seeding pots, e.g. Team 1 was not necessarily the team from Pot 1 in the draw.\"\nThere were scheduling restrictions: for example, teams from the same city (e.g. Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid) in general were not scheduled to play at home on the same matchday (to avoid them playing at home on the same day or on consecutive days, due to logistics and crowd control), and teams from \"winter countries\" (e.g. Russia) were not scheduled to play at home on the last matchday (due to cold weather).\nThe draw also established the group compositions of the UEFA Champions League Path of the 2019–20 UEFA Youth League.\nTeams.\nBelow are the participating teams (with their 2019 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their seeding pot.

        "title": "Seed cycling",
        "text": "Seed cycling is the rotation of different edible seeds into the diet at different times in the menstrual cycle. Practitioners believe that since some seeds promote estrogen production, and others promote progesterone production, that eating these seeds in the correct parts of the menstrual cycle will balance the hormonal rhythm. \nThere is no scientific evidence to support the belief that cycling the seeds actually regulates the hormonal rhythm, but the practice is probably harmless.\nOverview.\nSeed cycling advocates note that the menstrual cycle is broken up into four interconnected phases. The first phase is menstruation, followed by the follicular phase, then ovulation, then the luteal phase.\nAssuming a 28-day cycle, the first 13 days represent the menstrual and follicular phases, in which day 1 is when menstruation begins. During day-13, the seed cycling diet suggests consuming either flax or pumpkin seeds daily to boost estrogen, which helps support these phases and the move towards ovulation. \nDays 14-28 represent the ovulatory phase and luteal phase, with ovulation around day 14. The seed cycling diet suggests sesame or sunflower seeds to boost progesterone at this time, ground up to increase the surface area for absorption of the essential fatty acids, minerals, and other nutrients.\nThe seed cycling diet relies on the belief that most women have a 28-day cycle. However, only 10-15% of women have 28-30 day cycles; most women's cycles vary, or run longer or shorter. For women with irregular or absent cycle, menopause, or post-menopause, the seed cycling diet suggests starting the seed cycle with any two weeks, and then rotating. However, many women who track their cycles through symptothermal methods (e.g. Basal Body Temperature and cervical mucus) are able to adapt the seed cycling protocol to their individual cycle and therefore do not need to rely on the belief that women have 28-day cycles.\nResearch.\nThere is currently a lack of solid scientific evidence that supports seed rotating between the phases of the menstrual cycle or the Moon directly impacts hormonal disorders. The proposed benefits are mostly due to anecdotal reports.\nSeed cycling claims are indirect effects on the women's hormonal cycles, PMS and, menopausal symptoms. However, there is research showing the direct benefits of the nutritional components present in the individual seeds, flax, pumpkin, sesame and sunflower seeds, in promoting hormonal balance. For example, flax seeds seem to be the most researched and beneficial. In a study, women taking one tablespoon of flax seed meal daily were able to lengthen their luteal phase, which resulted in fewer months without any ovulation. Flax seed has an effect on the luteal phase progesterone-estradiol ratio.\nAnother theory for rotating the seeds, rather than consuming all four at once, is the different mineral content that might support the follicular or luteal phases. For example, during the follicular phase, there is an increase in calcium, whereas there is an increase in magnesium during the luteal phase.\nReception.\nSeed cycling has been greeted sceptically by the press, with headlines like \"Can 'seed cycling' really help to balance your hormones?\" (\"The Telegraph\") and \"Can Eating Seeds Balance Your Hormones?\" (\"New York\" magazine's \"The Cut\" blog). It has been called an obsession by \"Good Housekeeping\". \"The Cut\" quotes dietitian Abby Langer as stating that food is not medicine, but that seed cycling might be \"a worthwhile component of a treatment plan\" for a hormonal imbalance, warning that seed cycling recipes using primrose oil could interact dangerously with anticoagulants and anaesthetics. \n\"Shape\" magazine notes that the seeds could possibly help regulate hormones, given their phytoestrogen content, but quotes Melinda Ring of the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago as stating that evidence is lacking, that the outcomes are unpredictable, and that she has seen women whose cycles became \"more irregular\" after taking phytoestrogens."

        "text": "David Wayne Jackson Jr. (born August 12, 1982) is an American professional basketball player for Franca of Novo Basquete Brasil (NBB). A 6 ft 3 in (1.92 m) tall combo guard, he played high school basketball in Maryland and North Carolina and attended Gulf Coast Community College in Florida after he failed to academically qualify to play Division I basketball. After two years at Gulf Coast, Jackson transferred to Penn State, where he played his last two years of eligibility. After going undrafted in the 2007 NBA draft he started his professional career in Uruguay with Defensor Sporting. He has earned several accolades while playing in South America, including two MVP awards (one in Argentina and one in Brazil), multiple all-star selections and an LNB scoring title in 2010. Jackson won the FIBA Intercontinental Cup in 2023 and was named the tournament MVP.\nHigh school career.\nJackson was born in Rockville, Maryland and resided in Gaithersburg, Maryland, attending High Point High School in nearby Beltsville, where he played the point guard position. After the end of his senior season in 2000–01, Jackson suffered a foot injury and failed to academically qualify for college basketball, scoring too low on the ACT and having to renounce to the only offer he received from Gettysburg College, a Division III school. After graduating high school he worked in an assisted living center before deciding to attend Bonner Academy, a prep school in Raleigh, North Carolina, trying to improve his grades and take the SAT to qualify for NCAA Division I basketball.\nCollege career.\nJackson visited several community colleges in Florida before joining Gulf Coast Community College in Panama City, Florida. In two years there he was a two-time All-Panhandle Conference selection and in his sophomore year he averaged 18.2 points, 6.4 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game, leading the state of Florida in 3-point percentage at 55%.\nJackson's performance at Gulf Coast earned him the attention of several Division I schools, and he received offers from Auburn, Penn State, West Virginia and South Carolina. He narrowed his choice between Auburn and Penn State, and ultimately signed to play for the latter in April 2005. He decided to major in business management. In his first year at Penn State he wore jersey number 32 and started all the 30 games he played, averaging 6.7 points, 3.2 rebounds and 2.9 assists in 29.2 minutes per game, ranking 5th in the team in scoring, 4th in rebounding and 2nd in assists behind Ben Luber, shooting 37.1% from the field and 29.3% from three. The following year at Penn State he played with another player named David Jackson (also known as DJ Jackson), and he started 21 out of 30 games, averaging 6.6 points, 3.1 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 24.8 minutes per game. He posted career-highs in all shooting categories, recording percentages of 41.7% from the field, 37.1% from three and 83.6% from the free throw line.\nProfessional career.\nBeginnings and MVP in Argentina.\nAfter the end of his college career, Jackson was automatically eligible for the NBA draft, but he went undrafted. He decided to join Defensor Sporting in Uruguay and he played in the LUB (21 points per game over 42 appearances and a career-high of 38 points in a game against Soriano) and in the 2007–08 FIBA Americas League, where in 6 games played he averaged 24.5 points, 3.2 rebounds and 3.7 assists, shooting 57.1% from the field, 45.2% from three and 82.4% from the free throw line.

He then transferred to La Unión in June 2009, and in his first season with the new team he led the league in scoring with 18.9 points per game, winning the Top Scorer title at the end of the season: he shot 57.7% from the field (43.8% from three) and 86.6% from the free throw line. He also played with La Unión for the following season, where over 51 games he averaged 19.4 points, 3.7 rebounds and 1.5 assists.\nThe first period in Brazil.\nIn 2011 he moved to Brazil, signing for Flamengo: he played in the Carioca State Championship, winning the title, and then moved to Venezuela, where he played for Guaiqueríes de Margarita. He then returned to Flamengo to play in the 2011–12 NBB season: over 38 games he played 32.2 minutes per game, averaging 16.2 points, 2.7 rebounds, 2.4 assists per game on 61.6% field goal percentage, 49.6% from three 92.5% from the free throw line, thus recording a 60–40–90 season.

It was known as Snake Esports from its creation in 2013 until its acquisition by sportswear company Li-Ning in 2019.\nLNG's main \"League of Legends\" team competes in the \"League of Legends\" Pro League (LPL), the top-level league for the game in China. LNG plays its home games at the Yangcheng International Esports Center in Suzhou.\nHistory.\nSnake Esports announced on 21 May 2019 that they had been acquired by athletic apparel company Li-Ning and that they were rebranding as LNG Esports. Top laner Li \"Flandre\" Xuanjun, jungler Lê \"SofM\" Quang Duy, mid laner Huang \"Fenfen\" Chen, bot laner Lu \"Asura\" Qi and support Hu \"Maestro\" Jianxin remained on the team following the acquisition. To complete LNG's inaugural roster, mid laner Bae \"Plex\" Ho-young and support Duan \"Duan\" De-Liang were acquired from Griffin and Vici Gaming respectively.\nLNG placed seventh in the 2019 LPL Summer regular season, qualifying for the first round of playoffs. After sweeping Invictus Gaming in the first round, LNG lost to Royal Never Give Up in the quarterfinals.\nIn late 2019, LNG announced several roster changes, dropping SofM, Plex, Fenfen, and Maestro, and signing jungler Xiong \"Xx\" Yulong, rookie support Liao \"lwandy\" Dingyang, and Taiwanese veteran mid laner Huang \"Maple\" Yi-tang. Bot laner Wang \"Light\" Guangyu was also promoted from LNG's academy team. This revamped roster's first tournament was the 2019 Demacia Cup, in which they placed third in their group and failed to qualify for the knockout stage (i.e. playoffs). Aside from promoting top laner Zhou \"chenlun17\" Pengyuan, LNG did not make any other changes to their starting roster during the 2020 season. LNG placed 16th in the spring split and 13th in the summer split, both times ending with a 5–11 record.\nLNG announced on 17 December 2020 that they had made several major changes to their roster. Top laner Chang \"M1kuya\" Xiao, mid laner Xie \"icon\" Tianyu, and most notably Korean star jungler Lee \"Tarzan\" Seung-yong had been acquired from SDX Gaming, OMG, and Griffin respectively. Despite these roster changes, in the 2020 Demacia Cup LNG once again finished third in their group and failed to qualify for the knockout stage. Hu \"Ale\" Jiale was subsequently acquired from TT Gaming and signed as a substitute top laner for the 2021 season.\nLNG placed tenth in the 2021 LPL Spring regular season and qualified for the first round of playoffs, where they were swept by Suning. LNG had a stronger showing in the summer split, placing eight in the regular season and taking upset victories over several higher-placed teams. However, LNG's summer playoff run was ended in the fourth round (i.e. quarterfinals) by Edward Gaming, which would go on to win that split's title. LNG's overall placements in the spring and summer splits earned them a spot in the 2021 LPL Regional Finals, where they defeated Rare Atom and Team WE to qualify for the 2021 World Championship."

        "text": "James Albert Nicholson (July 13, 1906 – May 8, 1983) was an American football player and coach. He was the first full-time head football coach at the University of Toledo, serving from 1930 to 1935, and compiling a record of 20–16–4.\nEarly life.\nNicholson attended Denison University, where he played center for the school's football team and was captain of the 1926 squad. He also played center for the Big Red basketball team and ran the half mile for the track team. In 1934, Nicholson married Kathleen Covert, a public school teacher. They had four sons.\nCoach.\nAfter graduating, Nicholson was an assistant football coach and head basketball coach at Sandusky High School in Sandusky, Ohio. He also served as the city's superintendent of playgrounds.\nIn 1930, Nicholson accepted the head coaching position at Toledo, as it would provide him with enough money to attend law school. During his first season, the Rockets lost their first five games and Nicholson dismissed five players for lack of effort. The school canceled the 1931 football season because the funds for the football team were impounded in closed banks. When football resumed in 1932, Nicholson started Toledo's first recruiting program and pushed for the school to have its football stadium, which would eventually led to the construction of the Glass Bowl. Following the 1934 season, a number of Toledo alumni requested a coaching change, but the school retained Nicholson. On October 17, 1935, Nicholson announced he would resign at the end of the season. Toledo finished the year with a 6–2–1; its best record to that point.\nBusiness.\nNicholson passed the Ohio bar in 1936, but never practiced law. Instead, he and his assistant coach, Charles Wertz purchased the Builders and Industrial Supply Company out of receivership. Wertz later sold his interest in the business to Nicholson founded and it was renamed the Nicholson Concrete Company. In 1960, the company merged with the Toledo Plaster &amp; Supply Co. to form Nicholson Concrete &amp; Supply Co. In 1968, he was succeeded as president by his son, J. Patrick Nicholson, but remained involved with the company as an advisor.\nFundraising.\nNicholson led the fundraising drive for the construction of St. Francis de Sales School and also led four tax increase campaigns – one to benefit the University and three to benefit public schools.\nHonors.\nIn 1963, the University of Toledo created the Nicholson Trophy, which was given annually to the football team's most valuable player. The Shoe Bowl trophy, which was given to the winner of Toledo's high school football championship, was also named for him.\nIn 1976, Nicholson was elected to the Denison University Athletic Hall of Fame.\nLater life.\nKathleen Nicholson died in 1974 and Nicholson later remarried Catherine Weir. He spent his later years in Pompano Beach, Florida. He died on May 8, 1983, while visiting his son in Sylvania, Ohio. He was survived by his second wife, four sons, two stepchildren, and a foster child."

The draw was Munster's first at home in the Champions Cup, against a Racing side that included former Munster players Donnacha Ryan and Simon Zebo in their starting XV.\nProp Stephen Archer won his 200th cap for Munster in their 2019–20 Pro14 round 7 fixture against Edinburgh on 29 November 2019, becoming the eleventh player to achieve the accolade for the province. Academy fly-half Ben Healy made his debut for Munster during the same game, scoring 11 points in the 18–16 defeat to the Scottish side.\nIn the Champions Cup back-to-backs against defending champions Saracens, Munster won 10–3 at home on 7 December 2019, with the English side picking up a losing bonus point. In the return fixture one week later, Munster were beaten 15–6, with two tries in the final quarter securing the win for Saracens and denying Munster a losing bonus point.\nFollowing an incident that triggered a large brawl in Munster's second fixture against Saracens in December 2019 and a complaint to the EPCR from Saracens, in which Munster team doctor Jamie Kearns was accused of verbally abusing Saracens hooker Jamie George, an independent panel upheld the complaint and found that Kearns had breached the EPCR's disciplinary rules, handing Kearns a three-week ban, suspended for 12 months, and a fine of €2,000 to be paid immediately.\nMunster went into their round 5 Champions Cup clash away to Racing 92 on 12 January 2020 knowing that they had to win to keep alive their hopes of progressing to the quarter-finals of the tournament, but despite leading the French club with ten minutes to go, late tries from Racing secured a 39–22 win for the home side. Munster needed results elsewhere to go their way if they were to stand any chance of qualifying for the quarter-finals as the final round of pool matches took place, but Glasgow Warriors 45–7 win against Sale Sharks ended those hopes before Munster's final game against Ospreys had even taken place. In the event, Munster won 33–6 against Ospreys, with Craig Casey, who made his European debut for the province in the defeat to Racing, scoring his first try for Munster, and Calvin Nash, Jack O'Sullivan and Ben Healy making their European debuts for the province.\nMunster's 68–3 win against South African side Southern Kings in round 11 of the Pro14 on 14 February 2020 was a record margin of victory for the province in the competition, and the ten tries scored also set a new record for the province. Academy member John Hodnett made his debut for Munster in the fixture, scoring a try and earning the Man-of-the-Match award. The match had an added poignancy for Munster, as their long-serving former CEO, Garrett Fitzgerald, who had only retired in June 2019, died following a battle with illness earlier that day.\nThe 2019–20 Pro14 was suspended indefinitely by tournament organisers on 12 March 2020 in response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Munster's round 14 and 15 fixtures against Italian side Benetton had already been postponed. Tyler Bleyendaal was forced to retire from playing rugby with immediate effect in May 2020 due to a persistent neck injury. In the same month, prop Brian Scott was also forced to retire with immediate effect due to injury. The regular season resumed on 22 August 2020, with the number of rounds reduced from 21 to 15 and any games postponed prior to the indefinite suspension of the season being deemed as 0–0 draws and both teams awarded two points. Rounds 14 and 15 took place as derbies in each territory, with the top two teams in each conference progressing to a semi-final stage.\nMunster resumed their season on 22 August 2020 with a fixture against Leinster in the Aviva Stadium, which Leinster won 27–25. Munster handed debuts to new signings Damian de Allende and RG Snyman, though Snyman's first appearance for the province lasted only 7 minutes after he was injured during a lineout. Andrew Conway scored tries either side of Keith Earls' try, with JJ Hanrahan kicking 10 points off the tee, and Chris Farrell won the Man-of-the-Match award.\nMunster completed their reduced 15 round Pro14 regular season with a seven try 49–12 win against Connacht, a victory that secured a semi-final against defending champions and provincial rivals Leinster on 4 September 2020. The tries came from Chris Cloete, Jeremy Loughman, Tadhg Beirne, James Cronin, two from Andrew Conway and a penalty try, with JJ Hanrahan kicking all five of his conversions and Rory Scannell converting the final try. As well as getting on the scoresheet, Tadhg Beirne also won the Man-of-the-Match award on his first game back after fracturing an ankle against Saracens in December 2019. Leinster won the semi-final 13–3, knocking Munster out at the semi-final stage of the Pro14 for the third season in a row and bringing an end to Munster's 2019–20 season.\nA total of 51 players were used during the marathon season, with seven academy members earning minutes for the province: Diarmuid Barron, Liam Coombes, Jake Flannery, Ben Healy, John Hodnett, Keynan Knox and Jack O'Sullivan. Healy and O'Sullivan also made their Champions Cups debuts during the season, alongside senior players Craig Casey, Shane Daly and Calvin Nash. Stephen Archer surpassed the 200-cap mark for the province, with John Ryan winning his 150th cap, Niall Scannell his 100th and Dan Goggin his 50th. Aside from squad captain Peter O'Mahony, Billy Holland, Jack O'Donoghue, Tommy O'Donnell, Niall Scannell and CJ Stander also captained the province. Rory Scannell made the most appearances during the season with 21, and also played the most minutes (1,276). JJ Hanrahan was the top points scorer with 171, and Andrew Conway was the top try scorer with 8.\nMunster's home game against Leinster in December 2019 was a record-equalling attendance for Thomond Park, with additional seating bumping the crowd up to 26,267. All three of Munster's home Champions Cup fixtures were the highest attendances for their respective rounds.\nInternationally, 12 Munster players represented Ireland at the 2019 Rugby World Cup: Tadhg Beirne, Joey Carbery, Andrew Conway, Keith Earls, Chris Farrell, Dave Kilcoyne, Jean Kleyn, Conor Murray, Peter O'Mahony, John Ryan, Niall Scannell and CJ Stander. Conway, Earls, Kilcoyne, Murray, O'Mahony and Stander also featured for Ireland in the 2020 Six Nations Championship. Three Munster players also represented Ireland under-20s in the Under-20s Six Nations: Tom Ahern, Jack Crowley and Ciaran Ryan.\nAt the delayed end of season awards in November 2020, Jack O'Sullivan won the \"John McCarthy Award for Academy Player of the Year\", Shane Daly won the \"Young Player of the Year\" award and CJ Stander won \"Player of the Year\" for a third time, whilst Garrett Fitzgerald, Munster's former CEO who died in February 2020, was inducted into Munster's Hall of Fame.\nSenior team transfers.\nUnlike previous seasons, where the majority of transfers take place during the summer pre-season, the 2019–20 season was unusual in that it had two separate periods of transfer activity due to the mid-season break in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Players scheduled to join clubs ahead of the commencement of the 2020–21 season where instead able to join their new club during this break, meaning they were available for the completion of the 2019–20 season.\nOctober 2018 – May 2020.\nPlayers in\nPlayers out\nFebruary 2019 – July 2020.\nPlayers in\nPlayers out\n2019–20 European Rugby Champions Cup.\nMunster were seeded in tier 2 when the draw for the 2019–20 European Rugby Champions Cup was made in Lausanne, Switzerland on Wednesday 19 June 2019, and were drawn in pool 4 alongside defending champions Saracens, Racing 92, who count former Munster players Donnacha Ryan and Simon Zebo amongst their squad, and fellow Pro14 side Ospreys.\n2019–20 Munster A season.\n2019–20 Celtic Cup.\nIn a change from the 2018–19 tournament, the 2019–20 edition of the Celtic Cup featured all eight teams in a single league, rather than two conferences, with each team playing seven matches and the top two teams advancing to a final on 12 October 2019. Munster A finished 6th in the tournament with 13 points, 2 wins, 1 draw and 4 defeats."

It was scheduled to be hosted by Indonesia between 21 May and 12 June 2021, which would have been the first FIFA tournament hosted by the country. It would have been also only the second U-20 World Cup to be held in Southeast Asia, first since 1997, and the first FIFA tournament in the region since the 2012 FIFA Futsal World Cup.\nUkraine were the defending champions, but did not qualify for the tournament after the UEFA decided to cancel 2020 UEFA European Under-19 Championship in Northern Ireland due to COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, and nominated five countries to participate in the U-20 World Cup based on the UEFA qualifying round coefficient ranking for the 2019–20 season. Thus, they became the seventh consecutive incumbent title holders to fail to qualify for the subsequent tournament.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic forced FIFA to cancel the 2021 tournament and award the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup hosting rights to Indonesia on 24 December 2020.\nHost selection.\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2021 FIFA U-20 World Cup was launched by FIFA on 23 April 2019, with the following timeline:\nFive bids to host the tournament were submitted per 23 May 2019, which were confirmed in July 2019. On 4 September 2019 there were three active bids under consideration. On 23 October 2019 it was reported that Brazil withdrew their bid due to low winning chances. The next day, Indonesia was announced as the winning bidder after the FIFA Council meeting in Shanghai, China.\nIndonesia had never hosted any FIFA tournament before, however had co-hosted the 2007 AFC Asian Cup, and solely hosted the 1962 and 2018 Asian Games.\nPeru had hosted one FIFA tournament, the 2005 FIFA U-17 World Championship. They originally won the bid to host the 2019 FIFA U-17 World Cup but later withdrawn by FIFA.\nWithdrawn bids.\nThailand had hosted the 2004 FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship and the 2012 FIFA Futsal World Cup while Myanmar had never hosted any FIFA tournament.\nThe joint bid of Myanmar and Thailand was withdrawn in favor of the Indonesian bid on 27 August 2019.\nBahrain had never hosted any FIFA tournament. Saudi Arabia had hosted four FIFA tournaments, the last three were the first three editions of the FIFA Confederations Cup, originally King Fahd Cup, named after the then-Saudi king. United Arab Emirates had held seven FIFA tournaments, namely the 2009 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup, the 2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup, and four FIFA Club World Cups (2009, 2010, 2017, and 2018). Saudi and UAE were also the only countries in the bidding process to have hosted the U-20 World Cup before, in 1989 and 2003 respectively.\nThe joint bid of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and UAE was left out from the list of FIFA U-20 World Cup bidders on 4 September 2019.\nBrazil had the most impressive record of hosting FIFA tournaments among the bidding countries individually; it had hosted two men's senior FIFA World Cups (1950 and 2014), the 2016 Olympic men's and women's football tournaments, the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship, the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and was about to host the 2019 FIFA U-17 World Cup during the bidding process. It also hosted the 2008 FIFA Futsal World Cup and the first three editions of the FIFA-organized Beach Soccer World Cup (2005, 2006, and 2007), to make a total of 11 FIFA tournaments hosted. \nBrazil withdrew on 23 October 2019 due to expectations of low winning chances according to Brazilian network Rede Globo. Had they won this bid, they would have become the first country to host all categories of FIFA-organized men's tournament (senior, U-20, U-17, Futsal, Club, and Beach Soccer).\nQualified teams.\nA total of 24 teams would have qualified for the final tournament. In addition to Indonesia which automatically qualified as hosts, 23 other teams would have qualified from six separate continental competitions. Only teams from UEFA had secured qualification to the tournament prior to its cancellation."

This event, which is usually part of the Canoe Sprint European Championships, was held separately as the ECA chose not to organise said event because of the European Games.\nExplanation of events.\nParacanoe competitions are contested in either a va'a (V), an outrigger canoe (which includes a second pontoon) with a single-blade paddle, or in a kayak (K), a closed canoe with a double-bladed paddle. All international competitions are held over 200 metres in single-man boats, with three event classes in both types of vessel for men and women depending on the level of an athlete's impairment. The lower the classification number, the more severe the impairment is - for example, VL1 is a va'a competition for those with particularly severe impairments.\nMedal summary.\nMedal events.\n Non-Paralympic classes"

This was the first season of divisional play in the SEC, due to the addition of new teams Arkansas and South Carolina.\nForward Melvin Cheatum and guard Gary Waites both graduated, and the Tide's freshman signees were center Cedric Moore, forwards Jason Caffey and Andre Perry, and guards Dennis Miller and Elliot Washington. These players joined a solid core of Robert Horry, Latrell Sprewell, and James \"Hollywood\" Robinson.\nThis was coach Wimp Sanderson's final season as coach of the Crimson Tide. Sanderson resigned amid sexual assault allegations from his former secretary.\nThe Tide advanced all the way to the 1992 SEC men's basketball tournament final, their fourth straight, but lost in the final to Kentucky. The Tide received an at-large bid to the 1992 NCAA tournament and defeated Stanford in the first round, but lost to North Carolina in the second round."

The tournament was hosted by Qatar between 11 and 21 December 2019, taking place at two venues in Al Rayyan.\nReal Madrid, winners of the last three Club World Cup titles, were unable to defend their title, having been eliminated in the round of 16 of the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League.

A third venue in Al Rayyan, Education City Stadium, was also originally planned to host matches during the tournament, including the final. In December 2019, FIFA moved all three matches (the second semi-final on 18 December and the third place match and final on 21 December) that were due to be played at the Education City Stadium to Khalifa International Stadium after the opening of the Education City Stadium was postponed to early 2020.\nMatch officials.\nFive referees, ten assistant referees, and six video assistant referees were appointed for the tournament.\nOne support referee was also named for the tournament.\nSquads.\nEach team had to name a 23-man squad (three of whom must be goalkeepers).

In October, FIFA sold 200 Club World Cup tickets to fans from Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, and 500 to those from the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. In November 2019, Human Rights Watch (HRW) criticised FIFA for neglecting fan welfare and selling tickets for the Club World Cup to those banned by their governments. HRW stated that FIFA should be aware of the risks that the football supporters can face in their countries and ensure that they are not exposed to the risk of harassment or prosecution.\nOn 5 November 2019, Liverpool Chief Executive Peter Moore assured that the Qatari authorities had permitted LGBT football fans to attend the FIFA Club World Cup matches in December 2019."

It was the 16th final of the FIFA Club World Cup, a FIFA-organised tournament between the club champions from each of the six continental confederations, as well as the host nation's league champions.\nThe final was contested between English club Liverpool, representing UEFA as the reigning champions of the UEFA Champions League, and Brazilian club Flamengo, representing CONMEBOL as the reigning champions of the Copa Libertadores. The match was played at the Khalifa International Stadium in Al Rayyan on 21 December 2019.\nLiverpool won the match 1–0 after extra time for their first FIFA Club World Cup title, having finished as runners-up on in 2005. As winners, Liverpool were rewarded with £4 million in prize money.\nTeams.\n\"In the following table, finals until 2005 were in the FIFA Club World Championship era, since 2006 were in the FIFA Club World Cup era.\"\nVenue.\nThe final took place at the Khalifa International Stadium in Al Rayyan, Qatar. The venue previously hosted matches at the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, including the final, and was chosen as a venue for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Originally, the final (along with the second semi-final and third place match) was to be played at the Education City Stadium, also located in Al Rayyan. However, the matches were moved after the opening of the Education City Stadium was postponed to early 2020.\nBackground.\nThe final was a rematch of the 1981 Intercontinental Cup, recognised by FIFA as a club world championship. Flamengo won the match 3–0 for their only club world title. Flamengo hadn't reached the final since while Liverpool had participated in two world championship matches in 1984 and 2005, also losing both to Independiente and São Paulo respectively.\nRoute to the final.\nLiverpool.\nLiverpool qualified for the Club World Cup as champions of the UEFA Champions League, having defeated Tottenham Hotspur in the final. The club had previously played in the 2005 Club World Championship, finishing as runners-up to São Paulo. Due to their participation in the tournament, Liverpool were forced to field a squad of youth players for an EFL Cup tie against Aston Villa due to the proximity of the two games, with the senior squad heading to Qatar to prepare while the reserves played in the cup game managed by U-23's manager Neil Critchley. As a result, they were beaten 5–0, the club's heaviest ever defeat in the competition \nLiverpool entered with a bye to the semi-finals, where they faced North American champions Monterrey of Mexico. The Reds went ahead in the 12th minute with a strike by Naby Keïta, who collected a pass from Mohamed Salah at the right side of the box. Monterrey equalised two minutes later as Rogelio Funes Mori, who collected a rebound off Alisson's save of a volley taken by Jesús Gallardo. Liverpool had several chances to retake the lead and switched to a new formation after half-time, but were unable to score and left themselves open to counter-attacks. Substitute Roberto Firmino scored the winning goal for Liverpool in the first minute of stoppage time, tapping in a pass from Trent Alexander-Arnold within the six-yard box.\nFlamengo.\nFlamengo qualified for the Club World Cup as winners of the Copa Libertadores, defeating River Plate with two last-minute goals by Gabriel Barbosa in the final, which was played a month before the Club World Cup.\nFlamengo entered with a bye to their semi-final match against AFC Champions League winners Al Hilal of Saudi Arabia. Flamengo started poorly and nearly conceded to Bafétimbi Gomis in the 16th minute after a big rebound from goalkeeper Diego Alves. Two minutes later, Mohammed Al-Breik crossed low to Salem Al-Dawsari in the box who scored the opening goal. Flamengo did little to create good chances in the first half but returned with a different posture and higher defensive line in the second half. Within three minutes, Flamengo's attacking trio leveled the score: Gabriel Barbosa found Bruno Henrique open inside the box, who rolled the ball across to Giorgian De Arrascaeta for the equalizer. Diego came on in substitute for Gerson and initiated the play in the 78th minute that resulted in Rafinha's cross to Bruno Henrique for the go-ahead header. Three minutes later, Diego found Bruno Henrique in the box whose cross was deflected in by Ali Al-Bulaihi for an own-goal. Moments later, André Carrillo of Al-Hilal was sent off after hitting De Arrascaeta. Flamengo advance with the 3–1 victory.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nFirmino nearly scored for Liverpool in the first minute of the match, as the ball was lifted to him past the defense but his shot sailed high. Shortly after, Jordan Henderson and Trent Alexander-Arnold of Liverpool find shots of their own. Both teams continued equally matched, with Flamengo having a spell of possession after a rocky start and maintaining nearly sixty percent possession in the half. At the other end, Bruno Henrique had several sights of goal, though none quite as dangerous as Liverpool's.\nTwo minutes into the second half Firmino nearly scored again, this time hitting the inside of the left post. In the 53rd minute, Flamengo's Barbosa shot high, and later forced a diving save from goalkeeper Alisson with a shot from inside the 18-yard box. In the 73rd minute, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was injured and came off for Adam Lallana. Flamengo brought on Vitinho and Diego in place of Giorgian De Arrascaeta and Éverton Ribeiro. In the 83rd minute Liverpool had their first dangerous shot on goal: a shot from Henderson fed by Mohamed Salah that was tipped over the frame by Diego Alves. Moments into stoppage time, Liverpool was awarded a penalty after Rafinha clipped the trailing foot of Sadio Mané free on goal on the edge of the penalty area. The decision was taken to video review where it appeared that the foul occurred outside the box and would result in a free kick, however the foul was waved off completely and play resumed with Flamengo. Regulation time ended with the match still scoreless.\nIn the 99th minute Liverpool scored the breakthrough goal. Henderson played a long ball forward to Mané which Rodrigo Caio could not deflect. One-on-one with Rafinha, Mané played to an approaching Firmino on his left who hesitated and scored around Diego Alves. For Liverpool, James Milner came on for Naby Keïta, and for Flamengo Lincoln came on for midfielder Gerson. In the second period of extra time, Flamengo found one dangerous opportunity to equalize in the 119th minute when a Vitinho cross rebounded back to him off a defender and he picked out Lincoln whose shot sailed high from ten yards out. Minutes later the match ended and Liverpool were victors by a score of 1–0.\nDetails.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPost-match.\nWith the win, Liverpool secured their first Club World Cup title, becoming the second English club to win the competition after Manchester United in 2008. Liverpool's Roberto Firmino was given the man of the match award, while teammate Mohamed Salah was awarded the Golden Ball by FIFA's Technical Study Group, which was jointly awarded with the Alibaba Cloud Player of the Tournament award. Flamengo's Bruno Henrique won the tournament's Silver Ball award."

        "text": "Vaevictis Esports was a Russian esports organization. It was founded on 16 November 2015 after the acquisition of the roster and \"League of Legends\" Continental League spot of Night Inside.\nThe organization received international attention in early 2019, when it became the first to sign an all-female \"League of Legends\" team to compete in a top-level professional league. The team had record-poor performances throughout the 2019 season, and Vaevictis was consequently removed from the league the following year for not fielding a competitive roster.\nBy the end of 2021, all of Vaevictis' teams had disbanded.\n\"League of Legends\".\nVaevictis announced on 10 February 2019 that it was signing an all-female \"League of Legends\" team to compete in the LCL, making it the first organization in a top-level professional league to do so. The roster was completely renewed after the existing pre-2019 players were let go. The announcement was immediately met with heavy criticism and accusations of it being a publicity stunt, as everyone on the roster mainly played in the support role and barely met the rank requirement to be on a professional team.\nVaevictis' starting roster for the 2019 LCL Spring Split consisted of top laner Diana \"TR1GGERED\" Ivanchenko, jungler Aida \"Merao\" Kazaryan, mid laner Elena \"VioletFairy\" Koval, bot laner Ksenia \"Trianna\" Meshcheryakova, and support Nataliya \"Ankote\" Zayko. In late February 2019 Vaevictis announced it was looking for new additions to their roster, and on 28 February top laner Elina \"Intgration\" Sokolova and bot laner Ekaterina \"Hroft\" Grishcheneva joined the team, while TR1GGERED and Ankote moved to support and substitute support respectively.\nVaevictis helped set two LCL records in the 2019 spring regular season, one in each of their matches against Vega Squadron. In their first match against Vega Squadron on 17 February 2019, Vaevictis lost with two kills to Vega Squadron's 52, setting an LCL record for the highest kill differential in a single game. Riot Games Russia issued a warning to Vega Squadron for \"intentionally stretching out\" the match. In their second match together on 3 March 2019, Vega Squadron defeated Vaevictis in 13 minutes, making it the shortest game in LCL history and the ninth shortest overall in competitive \"League of Legends\". Vaevictis ended the regular season in last place with 0 wins and 14 losses.\nIn an interview given on 7 March 2019, Ankote revealed the reason behind the roster changes; she alleged that a toxic team environment and verbal harassment by TR1GGERED led to arguments between her and her teammates, which prompted Vaevictis' management to seek a replacement for either her or TR1GGERED. Ankote apologized to her teammates for her performance in the top lane after roleswapping with TR1GGERED before the roster changes, saying she was not used to the role. According to Ankote, her teammates ridiculed her apology and dismissed it as an excuse. After an investigation, Riot Games Russia issued TR1GGERED a two-game ban on 15 March 2019 for verbal harassment and threatening Ankote on stream.\nA new roster was announced on 7 July 2019. Top laner Anastasiya \"HellMa\" Pleyko and mid laner Olga \"PewPewSolari\" Arsenyeva joined Vaevictis, while TR1GGERED, Ankote, Hroft, and Don Hell left. Merao remained on the team, as did Intgration, who switched roles and became a bot laner. On 25 July 2019, head coach Daniel \"Remus\" Klimanov, who played for Vaevictis prior to their decision to field an all-female team, joined the roster as the new starting mid laner. However, the team once again finished last with a 0–14 record.\nIn February 2020 it was announced that Vaevictis would be removed from the LCL because the team did not field a competitive roster during the 2019 season, leading to poor results that were disproportionate in comparison to that of the other teams in the league. The organisers of the LCL stated: \"The results of the 2019 season showed a huge difference in Vaevictis Esports' results compared to other LCL teams, which is an unacceptable level of competitiveness in a franchised league. In this regard, Vaevictis Esports will not participate in the LCL's 2020 season.\""

The final was originally scheduled to be played in December 2020, but was moved to February due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the scheduling of the various continental club competitions.\nBayern Munich won the match 1–0 for their second FIFA Club World Cup title and fourth title at the global level. With the win, Bayern became the second European team to complete a sextuple (six trophies in a year) after Barcelona in 2009; they had won a continental treble in the previous season, along with their domestic and continental super cups in the 2020–21 campaign.\nVenue.\nThe Education City Stadium in Al Rayyan, Qatar was announced as the final venue on 23 December 2020. The venue finished construction and opened in 2020, and will host matches at the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Originally, the stadium was to host the second semi-final, third place play-off and final of the 2019 FIFA Club World Cup, but the matches were moved to the Khalifa International Stadium after the opening of the Education City Stadium was postponed.\nBackground.\nBayern Munich reached their second Club World Cup Final in two tournament appearances, having done so in 2013, which they won against Raja Casablanca. Overall, it was their fourth club world championship final, having won their Intercontinental Cup in 1976 and 2001. Bayern Munich were seeking their sixth title in a year, having won the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and UEFA Champions League in the 2019–20 season, followed by the UEFA Super Cup and DFL-Supercup so far in the 2020–21 campaign. Therefore, a victory would see become the second team to win a sextuple, consisting of a continental treble (domestic league, domestic cup and continental competition), followed by the subsequent domestic and continental super cups and FIFA Club World Cup in the following season. This feat had only previously been achieved by Barcelona in 2009 (end of the 2008–09 season and start of the 2009–10 season).\nUANL became the first side from CONCACAF to reach the final of the Club World Cup. They were making their debut appearance in the competition, having qualified by winning their first CONCACAF Champions League title in 2020.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nIn the 59th minute, Benjamin Pavard got the only goal of the game when he shot into an empty net from six yards out after the ball came to him when Robert Lewandowski challenged for a ball in the air with UANL goalkeeper Nahuel Guzmán. The goal was reviewed by VAR for an offside before eventually being awarded. \nDetails.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

He played college baseball for the NC State Wolfpack. He was selected with the 15th overall pick of the 2019 Major League Baseball draft by the Los Angeles Angels.\nAmateur career.\nAlongside baseball, Wilson also played football and basketball in middle school. Wilson attended Kings Mountain High School in Kings Mountain, North Carolina. While playing high school football, he was a nose guard turned quarterback until he quit in order to concentrate on baseball. As a senior, he hit .535/.673/1.253 with 14 home runs in 26 games. Undrafted out of high school in the 2016 Major League Baseball draft, he enrolled at North Carolina State University where he played college baseball for the NC State Wolfpack.\nIn 2017, as a freshman at NC State playing primarily second base, Wilson started all 61 games and batted .300/.377/.504 with 21 doubles (tied for the league lead; the second-highest total of any freshman in the nation), eight home runs, and 48 RBIs. He was named to the ACC All-Freshman Team along with being named a Freshman All-American by D1Baseball and \"Collegiate Baseball Magazine\". As a sophomore in 2018, playing shortstop he hit .307/.376/.588 with three triples, 15 home runs, and 53 RBIs in 59 games. During the season, he was named ACC Player of the Week three times, which set an NC State record. He was also named to the All ACC-First Team. After the season, he played for the USA Baseball Collegiate National Team.\nPrior to the 2019 season, Wilson was named a preseason All-American by multiple media outlets including Baseball America and \"Collegiate Baseball Newspaper\". He was named the ACC Defender of the Year along with being named to the All ACC-First Team for the second consecutive year. He played shortstop and finished the season slashing .339/.425/.665 with 20 doubles, 16 home runs, and 57 RBIs in 55 games.\nProfessional career.\nWilson was considered one of the top prospects for the 2019 Major League Baseball draft. He was selected by the Los Angeles Angels with the 15th overall selection. He signed with the Angels on June 10 for a signing bonus of $3.4 million. After signing, he made his professional debut with the Orem Owlz of the Rookie Advanced Pioneer League. Over 46 games, he slashed .275/.328/.439 in 189 at bats with 23 runs, five home runs, and 18 RBIs.\nOn December 10, 2019, Wilson and Zack Cozart were traded to the San Francisco Giants in exchange for a player to be named later or cash considerations. He did not play a minor league game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. \nTo begin 2021, he was assigned to the Eugene Emeralds of the High-A West. After slashing .251/.339/.497 in 195 at bats with 37 runs, ten home runs, and 26 RBIs over 49 games, he was promoted to the Richmond Flying Squirrels of the Double-A Northeast in early July.

He was selected to play in the Arizona Fall League for the Scottsdale Scorpions after the season. \nHe returned to Richmond to begin the 2022 season. In mid-May, he was promoted to the Sacramento River Cats of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League, but he was reassigned to Richmond in late August. He missed time during the season due to injury, and rehabbed with the Rookie-level Arizona Complex League Giants. Over a combined 71 games played for the season in three leagues, he hit .250/.346/.452 in 252 at bats with 43 runs, 13 home runs, and 38 RBIs.

        "text": "The 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs was the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL) for the 2019–20 season. The playoffs began on August 1, 2020, and concluded on September 28, 2020, with the Tampa Bay Lightning winning their second Stanley Cup in franchise history, defeating the Dallas Stars four games to two in the Stanley Cup Finals. The playoffs were originally scheduled to begin in April, a few days after the regular season, and end in June. However, on March 12, the regular season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn May 26, commissioner Gary Bettman confirmed that the league was going to use a 24-team playoff format to finish the season, conducted in two or more host cities as \"hubs\" with players placed under strict health protocols, quarantined from the general public, and all games played behind closed doors with no fans admitted. On July 10, the league ratified an agreement for its protocols with the NHL Players Association (NHLPA). The Eastern Conference played its early-round games at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto, while the early rounds for the Western Conference, as well as the conference finals and Stanley Cup Finals, were played at Rogers Place in Edmonton. This was the first Stanley Cup playoffs to be contested entirely in Canada since 1925, as well as the first time that the Stanley Cup was awarded on Canadian ice since 2011.\nThe Boston Bruins made the playoffs as the Presidents' Trophy winners with the most points (i.e. best record) during the regular season. The Pittsburgh Penguins increased their postseason appearance streak to fourteen seasons, the longest active streak. For the first time since 1996, all California-based teams, the Anaheim Ducks, Los Angeles Kings, and San Jose Sharks, missed the playoffs. Six Canadian-based teams made the postseason this year, the most since 1993. It also marked the first time since 1986 that all four teams in cities based in Western Canada made the playoffs. In addition, it marked the only time to date that both the Winnipeg Jets and Arizona Coyotes (previously the original Jets, before relocation) qualified for the playoffs in the same season, as well as the only time that the Coyotes made the playoffs since 2012. This was the last playoff appearance for the Coyotes before suspending operations four years later. For the first time since 1999, all former World Hockey Association teams (Edmonton Oilers, Arizona Coyotes, Carolina Hurricanes, and Colorado Avalanche) made the playoffs.\nGame two of the second round series between the Vancouver Canucks and Vegas Golden Knights was the 94th game of the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs, surpassing the previous single-year record of 93 established in 2014. On September 17, the Tampa Bay Lightning became the first team in NHL history to win the clinching game of their first three series in overtime. The Dallas Stars set the record for the most games played in one playoff year (27) in game six of the Stanley Cup Finals; the previous record (26) was shared by the 1987 Philadelphia Flyers, 2004 Calgary Flames, 2014 Los Angeles Kings, 2015 Tampa Bay Lightning and 2019 St. Louis Blues. Game six of the Stanley Cup Finals was also the 130th game of the playoffs, setting the all-time record for most games played in one playoff year.\nAll games that were originally scheduled on August 27 and 28 were postponed due to a wildcat strike, in response to the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin.\nPlayoff format.\nOn May 26, the league announced that 24 teams (12 per conference) advanced to this special conference-based playoff tournament with teams being seeded based on their points percentage at the time the regular season was suspended on March 12. The top four teams in each conference played in a separate seeding round-robin, with regular season overtime and shootout rules, with the clubs accumulating points like the regular season, to determine the seeding in the first round. In addition, any ties in the Round-robin standings were broken by the regular season points percentage. The eight lower seeded teams in each conference played in the Qualifying Round, a best-of-five series with playoff overtime rules. The winners of these series advanced to face one of the Round-Robin teams in the First Round.\nOn May 28, the NHL stated that both the Round-robin and the Qualifying Round were to be counted under playoff records, on the same day that the league declared the winners of the stats-based regular-season NHL awards. The league then announced on June 4 that all series after the Qualifying Round would remain a best-of-seven series but were re-seeded after each round. With the ratification of an extension to the collective bargaining agreement on July 10, the league also announced that all teams participating in the qualifying round are considered to have made the playoffs and have participated in a playoff series.\nHost cities.\nThe playoffs were held in two \"hub\" cities both in Canada; Edmonton, Alberta at Rogers Place, and Toronto, Ontario at Scotiabank Arena. They were announced as host cities on July 10 with the NHLPA's ratification of the Return to Play plan, and an extension to its collective bargaining agreement with the NHLPA through the 2025–26 season. From the start of the playoffs through to the end of the Second Round, each city hosted all of the games for one conference: the Eastern Conference teams played in Toronto, and the Western Conference teams played in Edmonton. All games in the conference finals and Stanley Cup Finals were played in Edmonton.\nEdmonton and Toronto were among a shortlist of ten host cities announced on May 26, along with Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Saint Paul, and Vancouver. After the league cut the shortlist down to six cities on June 22, Las Vegas and Vancouver were considered to be the frontrunners to host games. Shortly after this, Vancouver dropped out of consideration on June 25, after health officials in British Columbia were unable to agree with the league on a protocol in the event that a player tested positive for COVID-19. Las Vegas and the other U.S. cities were passed over after Nevada and other U.S. states began to experience a spike in COVID-19 cases in late June; it was reported that the NHL originally intended to have one host city in Canada and one in the United States.\nWith the New York Rangers playing designated home games in the hub cities instead of in Madison Square Garden, the team's home arena was able to keep its tax exemptions by executing an act of God clause in its agreement with New York City. Under normal circumstances, like the 2014 NHL Stadium Series and 2018 NHL Winter Classic games played at other New York City venues, the Rangers would have always been designated as the visiting team to avoid breaking Madison Square Garden's tax-exempt status.\nEach group of teams played inside what was called a \"bubble\". A secure perimeter was constructed around both venues with various amenities, with Edmonton's covering four hotels in the Ice District and Rogers Place's existing practice facilities, and Toronto's split between Exhibition Place (Hotel X, BMO Field, &amp; Coca-Cola Coliseum) and the Fairmont Royal York hotel (which is connected to Scotiabank Arena). Both sites included fitness, dining and recreation areas. Restaurants were operating within the secure zones, and players were able to order outside food via concierge and local food delivery services. The games were held behind closed doors, but non-participating players were allowed to watch games. A large \"stage\" with multiple video screens was constructed to cover the empty stands for both teams in each end of the arena, and in-arena presentation was customized for each team when they were the designated home team (including use of their goal music, among other features). The league implemented a compressed playoff schedule with more back-to-back games than usual to help address \"bubble fatigue\" among the players, who had to live with monotonous daily routines away from their families for several weeks.\nAlthough the general public was not permitted within the direct vicinity of the arena or inside, Oilers Entertainment Group announced plans to set up an outdoor \"FanFest\" at the site of a former casino near Rogers Place with approval of municipal and provincial health officials, including a \"drive-in\" screening games and a beer garden.\nMedical protocols.\nUnder the Return to Play plan that was ratified on July 10, any player could opt out of the restart without providing a reason and without any penalty, provided that they had informed their team by July 13, when formal training camps opened. COVID-19 tests were then to be administered to players and staff every other day. On July 19, testing increased to three times 48 hours apart. The identities of those who tested positive were not released to the public, they would then be isolated and designated with the generic description \"unfit for play\" until they were medically cleared, and all injury updates were handled by the league instead of the teams.\nTeams arrived at their hub city on July 26; they were isolated in a \"secure zone\" consisting of their hotels, restaurants, practice facilities, and the arena. Testing was done every day, as well as daily temperature and symptom checks. Individuals had to wear masks outside their hotel rooms except when eating, exercising, or while on the ice or bench. Other exceptions included during interviews with appropriate social distancing.\nUnder the \"Quarantine Act\", all travellers entering Canada at the time were required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival. The NHL received an exception to this policy for its players and staff, as long as they remained within the secure zone and were restricted from access to or by the general public. Anybody who left the bubble without prior approval could have faced a mandatory 14-day quarantine or been barred from returning. Teams could have also faced fines or loss of draft picks.\nDuring the conclusions of each Qualifying Round series, teams exchanged fist bumps instead of the traditional handshakes. As players and coaches continued to test negative for COVID-19, the traditional handshake lines returned at the end of each first-round series. After entering the bubble, the league had no personnel test positive for the virus during the playoffs.\nPlayoff teams.\nThe following teams qualified for the playoffs:\nPlayoff bracket.\nIn each round, the highest remaining seed in each conference is matched against the lowest remaining seed. The higher-seeded team is awarded home ice advantage. In the Stanley Cup Finals, home ice was determined based on regular season points percentage. Each best-of-five series followed a 2–2–1 format: the higher-seeded team was the designated as the host for games one and two (and game five, if necessary), and the lower-seeded team was the host for games three (and game four, if necessary). Each best-of-seven series followed a 2–2–1–1–1 format: the higher-seeded team was the host for games one and two (and games five and seven, if necessary), and the lower-seeded team was the host for games three and four (and game six, if necessary). In the First Round, the top four teams in each conference were seeded one through four based on their final standings from the Round-robin. The teams that advanced from the Qualifying Round were re-seeded five through eight based on their regular season points percentage.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nExhibition games.\nPrior to the start of the playoffs, all 24 qualified teams played one exhibition game.\nStanley Cup qualifiers.\nThe top four playoff teams in each conference played in a round-robin tournament against each other to determine the final playoff seeding. The round-robin games were played with regular season overtime and shootout rules, with the teams accumulating points like the regular season, and any ties in the round-robin standings were broken by the regular-season points percentage instead of regulation wins.\nThe bottom eight playoff teams in each conference played in a best-of-five series to determine which four teams advanced to the first round. The qualifying round games were played with Stanley Cup playoff overtime rules. Seeding was determined by regular season points percentage.\nEastern Conference seeding round-robin.\nDuring the first game of round-robin play, the Flyers' Carter Hart made 34 saves against the Bruins in a 4–1 victory. In the game between Washington and Tampa Bay, with the game forced to go to a shootout (the first in Stanley Cup playoff history), Nikita Kucherov's shot got past Braden Holtby for the winning goal in a 3–2 triumph. The Lightning then faced the Bruins, and Tyler Johnson's goal at 18:33 of the third period won the game for Tampa Bay 3–2. In the Flyers' match-up against the Capitals, Scott Laughton's two goals assisted Philadelphia's 3–1 victory. Between the top two seeds, the Flyers defeated the Lightning 4–1 to take the first seed riding on Nicolas Aube-Kubel's two goals in the first period. Battling out for the third spot, Holtby made 30 saves for Washington in their victory, defeating the Presidents' Trophy-winning Boston Bruins 2–1.\nWestern Conference seeding round-robin.\nDuring the first game between Colorado and St. Louis, Nazem Kadri scored with 0.1 remaining on the clock for the Avalanche emerging victorious 2–1.

Vegas forward Alex Tuch and defenceman Shea Theodore both scored twice in their game against St. Louis, emerging victorious 6–4. Battling out for the first seed, the Avalanche and Golden Knights held a back-and-forth affair until Alex Tuch scored in overtime to give Vegas a 4–3 victory, emerging as the top seed in the Western Conference. The Round-robin finale between the Stars and Blues was to determine the third seed. Joe Pavelski tied the game at one for the Stars with only 32 seconds remaining in regulation, then Denis Gurianov scored the only goal of the shootout to give Dallas the third seed with the 2–1 victory.\nEastern Conference qualifying round.\n(5) Pittsburgh Penguins vs. (12) Montreal Canadiens.\nPittsburgh finished fifth in the Eastern Conference with 86 points in 69 games for a points percentage of .623.

Dallas won both games in this year's regular season series.\nPlayer statistics.\nSkaters.\nThese are the top ten skaters based on points, following the conclusion of the playoffs.\nGoaltenders.\nThis is a combined table of the top five goaltenders based on goals against average and the top five goaltenders based on save percentage, with at least 420 minutes played. The table is sorted by GAA, and the criteria for inclusion are bolded.\nActivism.\nOn August 26, 2020, various professional athletes in the U.S began to go on strike from their respective sports contests in response to the August 23 police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and the protests which followed. These strikes began with the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Other players in the NBA, Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer and Women's National Basketball Association soon followed suit and also decided not to play their August 26 games.\nWhen these cancellations south of the border began, NHL players were still isolated in the Edmonton and Toronto bubbles, with game two of the Islanders–Flyers series already in progress when the Bucks first announced their decision to not play. The NHL then continued to play the remaining August 26 games, as NHL players did not take a strong stand for the rest of the day. After pressure brought by the postponement of games by the other leagues, and discussions by players of the Hockey Diversity Alliance such as Evander Kane and Mathew Dumba, the NHLPA announced that they would not play their games on August 27 and August 28. The affected games involved all eight teams remaining: game three between the Flyers and Islanders, game three between the Golden Knights and Canucks, game four between the Lightning and Bruins, and game four between the Avalanche and Stars. The NHL fully supported their decision to postpone the games. On September 1, Dallas Stars president Brad Alberts reported that his team had lost some corporate and personal season ticket holders as a result of the protest.\nTelevision.\nThis marked the sixth postseason under Rogers Media's 12-year contract for Canadian television rights to the NHL. All games were exclusively broadcast by Sportsnet and CBC under the \"Hockey Night in Canada\" brand, and streamed on Sportsnet Now, CBCSports.ca (for games televised by CBC), or the subscription service Rogers NHL Live.\nThis also marked the ninth postseason under NBC Sports' current 10-year contract for American rights. All national coverage of games were aired on either NBCSN, the NBC broadcast network, CNBC, NHL Network, or USA Network. During the round-robins, qualifying round, and first round, excluding games exclusively broadcast on NBC, the regional rightsholders of each participating U.S. team produced local telecasts of their respective games.\nOnly technical staff such as cameramen and producers were present inside the \"bubble\". A clean host feed was then sent to media partners to add commentary and surrounding coverage, and interviews with players had to be conducted via videoconferencing. Commentators called the games remotely off of monitors from either their respective studios or from their home arena press boxes. This same arrangement was also done for the radio networks of every team.\nWhile it was initially stated that all commentators would broadcast remotely, the league eventually allowed a handful of both Sportsnet and NBC commentators and reporters into the hubs to call select games. Chris Cuthbert, who jumped from TSN to Sportsnet during the break in June, and Louie DeBrusk were on-site in Edmonton; and Jim Hughson and Craig Simpson were on-site in Toronto during the qualifying, first, and second rounds; they later moved to the Edmonton hub. For NBC, John Forslund, Mike Milbury, and Brian Boucher were initially sent to Toronto; and Pierre McGuire to Edmonton. Milbury was later removed from commentary for the remainder of NBC Sports' coverage after making insensitive comments following the fifth game of the Islanders–Capitals first round series. Gord Miller later joined Forslund, Milbury, and Boucher at the Toronto bubble and alternated with Forslund on a handful of broadcasts. Most of NBC's other commentators began working games remotely from NBC Sports' studios in Stamford, Connecticut, with NBC planning for \"the majority of calls\" to eventually be conducted on-site, including the last two rounds of the playoffs in Edmonton. Kenny Albert, who worked for both NBC and the New York Rangers radio broadcasts, traveled to the Edmonton bubble after the Rangers were eliminated in the qualifying round. Albert called play-by-play of every game of the Western Conference second round and the first three games of the Western Conference finals before leaving the Edmonton bubble to join the NFL on Fox broadcast team. Forslund, Boucher, and Eddie Olczyk later flew to the Edmonton bubble to call the conference finals. In the case of NBC lead play-by-play commentator Mike \"Doc\" Emrick, he was working games from his home studio in Metro Detroit because he is a cancer survivor over the age of 70, and therefore at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19.\nAdditional cameras were used to provide new angles not usually possible when a crowd is present, and de-emphasize views of the arenas' stands. The telecasts used simulated crowd noise provided by Electronic Arts, combined with recordings of team-specific chants by season ticketholders of participating teams (the latter of which will also be played in-arena). All games carried a five second broadcast delay in order to censor offensive language.\nNBC staff were working on the Toronto broadcasts, while Sportsnet staff did the same with the Edmonton broadcasts. Steve Simmons of the \"Toronto Sun\" reported that Canadian freelance broadcast workers were upset that NBC personnel were being allowed into Canada to work in Toronto instead of them. The NHL's EVP of communications Gary Meagher stated that splitting production in this manner had been intended \"from the onset\". Premier of Ontario Doug Ford admitted that plans of NBC's involvement were not part of the early negotiations with the league.\nViewership.\nAverage U.S. viewership of the playoff rounds were down by 28% compared to 2019, the lowest to-date over the course of NBC's current broadcast rights contract. Amid expanded competition due to the difference in scheduling, game one of the Stanley Cup Finals was seen by only 2.12 million viewers; with an average of 2.15 million across the entire series, it was the least-watched Stanley Cup Finals since 2007, and down 61% over 2019. Airing opposite a \"Monday Night Football\" contest between the Kansas City Chiefs and Baltimore Ravens, Game six was seen by 2.88 million viewers, the least-watched series-clinching game since at least 2000."

        "text": "The 2020 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 2019–20 season and the culmination of the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs. This series was between the Eastern Conference champion Tampa Bay Lightning and the Western Conference champion Dallas Stars. The Lightning won the best-of-seven series, four games to two, for their second championship in franchise history. The Lightning had home-ice advantage in the series with the better regular season record. The series began on September 19 and concluded on September 28. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire series was played behind closed doors at Rogers Place in Edmonton. The pandemic resulted in the league suspending the regular season on March 12, 2020, and then scheduling a special 24-team playoff format to be held in two neutral \"hub cities\" (Edmonton and Toronto) that began on August 1. Thus it became the first Stanley Cup Finals to be played in the month of September.\nThis was the first Stanley Cup Finals since to be played entirely outside the Eastern Time Zone, the first since to be played entirely in one location, the first since to be played entirely in Canada, and the first since to have the Stanley Cup awarded in a Canadian arena. This was the first Stanley Cup Finals since to feature a neutral site game and the first Stanley Cup Finals to feature two teams from the American Sun Belt (Texas and Florida).\nThe Dallas Stars set the record for most playoff games played by a team in a single postseason at 27 games.\nPaths to the finals.\nReturn to play.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic, and later that day, the National Basketball Association suspended all games after players tested positive for the virus. One day later, the NHL announced that the 2019–20 season had been paused indefinitely. On May 22, the league and the NHLPA agreed on a basic framework to stage a 24-team playoff tournament behind closed doors, conducted in two neutral \"hub\" cities to help protect teams from the virus. The details of the plan were announced publicly on May 26. The seeds would be based on each club's points percentage when the season paused on March 12, effectively scrapping the remainder of the regular season. In the opening round of the 24-team playoff format, the top four teams in each conference played each other in a separate Seeding Round-robin to determine the seeding in the first round. The eight lower seeded teams in each conference played in the qualifying round, a best-of-five series to advance to the next round. The first round through to the finals remained as best-of-seven series. On July 10, along with the ratification of an extension to the collective bargaining agreement, the NHL and the NHLPA formally agreed to begin the playoffs on August 1 (concluding no later than early October), with games being hosted by Edmonton (Western Conference early rounds, Conference Finals, and Stanley Cup Finals) and Toronto (Eastern Conference early rounds). U.S. cities were also considered, but were passed over after several U.S. states experienced a spike in COVID-19 cases in late June.\nDallas Stars.\nThis was the franchise's fifth appearance in the finals. They won the Stanley Cup in 1999 before losing the finals in 2000. They also made two appearances as the Minnesota North Stars in 1981 and 1991.\nDuring the offseason, Dallas signed forwards Corey Perry and Joe Pavelski as well as defenceman Andrej Sekera in free agency. The team also re-signed defenceman Taylor Fedun and forward Jason Dickinson. The team made no trades during the regular season.\nOn December 10, 2019, head coach Jim Montgomery was dismissed due to \"unprofessional conduct inconsistent with the core values and beliefs\" of both the team and the league, and was replaced by Rick Bowness. Before joining the Stars organization, Bowness had served as associate coach with the Lightning from 2013 to 2018.\nWhen the regular season was suspended on March 12, 2020, the Stars had a 37–24–8 record and a .594 points percentage to finish third in the Central Division and fourth in the Western Conference. After play resumed in the hubs, Dallas placed third in the Round Robin. The Stars then defeated the Calgary Flames in six games in the first round, the Colorado Avalanche in seven games in the second round, and the Vegas Golden Knights in five games in the Western Conference Finals.\nTampa Bay Lightning.\nThis was the Tampa Bay Lightning's third appearance in the finals. They won the Stanley Cup in 2004 before losing the finals in 2015.\nDuring the offseason, Tampa Bay signed goaltender Curtis McElhinney, defencemen Luke Schenn, Luke Witkowski, and Kevin Shattenkirk, and forward Patrick Maroon during free agency. Tampa Bay also re-signed goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy and forwards Cedric Paquette and Brayden Point. During the regular season, the Lightning traded for forwards Blake Coleman and Barclay Goodrow. They also signed Zach Bogosian whose contract had been terminated by the Buffalo Sabres during the season. During Phase 2 of the Return to Play plan, captain Steven Stamkos injured himself while skating, and subsequently missed the round robin and the first three rounds of the playoffs for the Lightning.\nWhen the regular season was suspended on March 12, the Lightning had a 42–21–6 record and a .657 points percentage to finish second in both the Atlantic Division and the Eastern Conference. After play resumed in the hubs, Tampa Bay placed second in the Round Robin. The Lightning then defeated the Columbus Blue Jackets in the first round, including winning Game 1 of the series that became the fourth longest game in NHL history, and the Boston Bruins in the second round in five games respectively. The Lightning then eliminated the New York Islanders in the Eastern Conference Finals in six games.\nGame summaries.\nGame one.\nIn the first period of game one, neither team produced many shots, yet each scored a goal. The first goal came from Stars defenceman Joel Hanley who took an open pass from Roope Hintz. Tampa Bay equalized the score on left winger Yanni Gourde's skate deflection. In the second period, both teams produced more shots, however, Dallas was up by two at the end of the period. Jamie Oleksiak fired a wrist shot which rebounded back to him which he then shot it over Lightning goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy to make it 2–1. The Stars' third goal started in their own end with Esa Lindell passing to Joel Kiviranta. Kiviranta then skated through centre, firing a shot that was blocked, but picked up the rebound to put it past Vasilevskiy for a 3–1 lead. In the third period, the Stars played more defensively, putting up only two shots compared to the Lightning who fired twenty-two shots at Anton Khudobin. The Stars held their ground for the remaining 20 minutes, and Jason Dickinson's empty-net goal sealed a 4–1 victory for Dallas.\nGame two.\nIn game two, the Lightning struck three times in the first period. Twice on the power-play, Victor Hedman and Nikita Kucherov set up both goal-scorers. The first came from a tic-tac-toe pass to Brayden Point firing it past Stars goalie Anton Khudobin. The second goal was another set-up pass; this time Kucherov fed it through the middle where Ondrej Palat made it 2–0. The Lightning made it 3–0 when the Stars fumbled the puck in their own zone and Anthony Cirelli gave it to Kevin Shattenkirk, whose shot at the blue line deflected off of Esa Lindell and past Khudobin. In the second period, the Stars shot eighteen times at Andrei Vasilevskiy and caught a break on the power-play. During Palat's slashing penalty, John Klingberg's shot deflected off of fellow Stars forward Joe Pavelski to cut the score to 3–1. Later in the period, a hit on Stars player Blake Comeau caused a skirmish to erupt, with Dallas players Corey Perry and Klingberg against Cedric Paquette and Hedman respectively. All players received simultaneous roughing penalties. In the third period, the Stars made it 3–2 when Mattias Janmark's shot snuck past Vasilevskiy. The Lightning kept their offense going in the final 20 minutes, pouring twelve shots on Khudobin, holding off the Stars, and ending the game 3–2 to tie the series 1–1.\nGame three.\nIn game three, Dallas put the heat on Andrei Vasilevskiy in the first period. However, among their sixteen shots, only one goal was successfully scored compared to the Lightning's two. Tampa Bay's first came from a misplay by Miro Heiskanen giving Nikita Kucherov a breakaway, sniping the puck past Anton Khudobin. Their second goal came from their captain Steven Stamkos returning from injury for his first game since being injured on February 25. After a rush by the Stars was stopped in the offensive zone, Victor Hedman passed the puck to Stamkos, who was racing on the right side, upon which he fired his shot over Khudobin's blocker to make it 2–0. The Stars' lone goal of the period came short-handed when a shot by Roope Hintz was stopped by Vasilevskiy. The rebound of that save went back to Hintz in the left corner who then passed to an open Jason Dickinson, whose shot got through Vasilevskiy to make it 2–1. The Lightning had a more dominant approach in the second period, putting off 21 shots and scoring three times. The first goal came following Alexander Radulov's hooking penalty which carried over from the first period. After a puck battle behind the net, Anthony Cirelli, who was falling down on the play, passed to Hedman who shot the puck under Khudobin's stick into the net. Tampa Bay's fourth goal arrived when the Stars began a line change and a 3-on-1 developed with Kucherov leading the rush and Brayden Point scoring the goal. The Lightning continued their offensive zone coverage towards the end of the period and in the final minute-and-a-half, Point fired a shot that rebounded to Ondrej Palat, who put it into the net for a 5–1 lead. Dallas then pulled Khudobin before the third period, replacing him with rookie Jake Oettinger. The Stars, showing some frustration, began roughing the Lightning on three occasions: the first with Mattias Janmark and Palat; then both Jamie Benn and Jan Rutta, who had a skirmish after the play, both earning misconducts as a result; and an errant cross-check at 18:05 by Joe Pavelski on Cedric Paquette, which caused a ruckus with both teams. Heiskanen's goal gave the Stars some life in the third period, but Tampa Bay's defense kept the Stars at bay, winning the game 5–2 and taking a 2–1 series lead.\nGame four.\nThe Tampa Bay Lightning overcame a 2–0 deficit in game four. In the first period, John Klingberg gave the Stars their first goal of the game subsequently on their first shot. The Stars gained a 2–0 lead when Jamie Benn set up Joe Pavelski, whose wrist shot got under Andrei Vasilevskiy. Tampa Bay got on the board with 33 seconds remaining in the period. The play began when defenceman Kevin Shattenkirk, from behind the Lightning net, gave an outstretched pass to Ondrej Palat, who then passed across to the right boards to find a solitary Brayden Point. He maneuvered around Anton Khudobin, going to his backhand to score. Point then tied the game early in the second period, on the power-play. During the Stars' penalty, Alex Killorn made a pass to the front, but the puck deflected off of Andrej Sekera's skate into the air, which Point then batted it into the net. The Stars soon regained the lead when Tyler Seguin's pass around Vasilevskiy got picked up by Corey Perry who, although tied up by Cedric Paquette, allowed the puck to trickle in off his stick. The Lightning tied the game up again when Andrew Cogliano got caught for hooking and on the ensuing Tampa Bay power-play, Mikhail Sergachev set up Nikita Kucherov for a one-timer, but the puck deflected off of Esa Lindell to Yanni Gourde who shot it past Khudobin. In the third period, Killorn put the Lightning up 4–3 when he went out around the net and shot at the top corner behind Khudobin. Pavelski tied the game 4–4 after picking up the rebound of Seguin's shot and then launching the puck at Vasilevskiy which deflected off of Shattenkirk into the net. Into overtime, Benn pushed down Tyler Johnson; controversially, he was called for tripping. While on the ensuing power-play, Patrick Maroon won an offensive zone face-off, sending it back to Victor Hedman. Hedman then passed it to Shattenkirk, whose shot at a sharp angle went over Khudobin's right pad for the game-winning goal and a 3–1 series lead.\nGame five.\nCorey Perry opened the scoring in the first period of game five. Jamie Oleksiak passed to Tyler Seguin, who then dropped it for Perry to score the initial goal for Dallas. In the second period, the Lightning struck back when Nikita Kucherov passed to Ondrej Palat and he skated past the Dallas defencemen and goaltender Anton Khudobin with a backhand to tie the game 1–1. The Lightning kept putting the pressure on the Stars for the remainder of the second period, firing away 13 shots. In the third period, Mikhail Sergachev's blast from the point gave the Lightning a 2–1 lead. The Stars tied the game 2–2 when Miro Heiskanen's shot from the point rebounded to Joe Pavelski, who put it past Andrei Vasilevskiy to break the record held by Joe Mullen for most career playoff goals scored by a US-born player. The two teams remained tied after the fact heading into overtime. In the first overtime, Dallas put up two shots compared to Tampa Bay's seven, but no goals were scored and the game continued on to double overtime. At 9:23 of the second overtime, Perry picked up a rebound from Seguin's shot and slid the puck past Vasilevskiy to give the Stars the game 3–2, forcing a sixth game.\nGame six.\nIn game six, the Lightning took a 1–0 lead in the first period. After John Klingberg was penalized for tripping, Brayden Point fired a wrist shot that flew past Anton Khudobin after following the rebound of his own initial shot. Tampa Bay gained a 2–0 lead in the second period when a Stars turnover to Patrick Maroon got to Cedric Paquette, who set up Blake Coleman for a one-timer. The Stars remained scoreless for the rest of the game, but they had a close chance in the second period when Joel Kiviranta's shot was stopped by Andrei Vasilevskiy with his skate. Although had a goal been scored, it would have been disallowed as Corey Perry was penalized for goaltender interference on the play. The Lightning held Dallas to just 8 shots in the first two periods combined. Vasilevskiy continued his shutout in the third period, stopping all 22 shots by Dallas, earning his first playoff shutout. With a 2–0 victory, the Tampa Bay Lightning won their second Stanley Cup. Lightning defenceman Victor Hedman was given the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs.\nTeam rosters.\nYears indicated in boldface under the \"Finals appearance\" column signify that the player won the Stanley Cup in the given year.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe Stanley Cup was presented to Lightning captain Steven Stamkos by NHL commissioner Gary Bettman following the Lightning's 2–0 win in game six.\nThe following Lightning players and staff qualified to have their names engraved on the Stanley Cup:\n2019–20 Tampa Bay Lightning\nEngraving notes.\nTampa Bay had 28 players on their extended official team roster during the 2020 playoffs. Of those, 27 automatically qualified to have their names engraved. \nTelevision and radio.\nIn Canada, the series was broadcast by Sportsnet and CBC Television in English, and TVA Sports in French. In the United States, the finals were split between NBC (Games one, and four through six) and NBCSN (Games two and three). The NHL initially had plans to produce broadcasts for each game using a skeleton crew on-site, such as cameramen and producers, and then each media partners' commentators on both TV and radio were to call the games remotely. The league then allowed both Sportsnet and NBC commentators into the hubs.\nAs he had been doing throughout the playoffs, 74-year-old NBC lead play-by-play commentator Mike \"Doc\" Emrick called the Cup Finals off of monitors from his home studio in Metro Detroit, citing his advanced age as a potential risk for severe illness from COVID-19. These were the final games that Emrick called; he announced his retirement on October 19, 2020.\nThis also ended up the last Cup Finals called by 63-year-old CBC/Sportsnet lead play-by-play commentator Jim Hughson. As the COVID-19 pandemic continued into the 2020–21 season, Hughson reduced his schedule to only work national Vancouver Canucks home games. He would later announce his retirement in September 2021."

        "text": "The 2020 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2019–20 season and conclusion of the season's playoffs. In this best-of-seven playoff series, the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat, 4–2, winning their first NBA championship in ten years. It was the franchise's 17th title overall, tying the Boston Celtics for the most in league history. The Lakers' LeBron James was named the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the fourth time in his career. He became the first player in league history to be named Finals MVP with three different franchises (two with the Heat, one with the Cleveland Cavaliers and one with the Lakers) and along with teammate Danny Green, jointly the third players to win the NBA Finals with three different teams. Lakers president Jeanie Buss became the first female controlling owner to guide her team to an NBA title.\nThe Lakers were the No. 1 seed in the West, while the Heat were No. 5 in the East, becoming the third-lowest seed to advance to the Finals. This was the first NBA Finals matchup between the two teams, and the first time that Finals participants had both missed the playoffs in the previous season. James had previously played with Miami under Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra, winning back-to-back NBA titles in 2012 and 2013 in four consecutive Finals appearances from 2011 to 2014, while Heat president Pat Riley was head coach of the \"Showtime\"-era Lakers from 1981 to 1990, leading them to four NBA titles in seven Finals appearances. For the first time in six seasons, the Golden State Warriors were not in the Finals.\nThe Finals were originally scheduled for June, but the season was suspended in mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The NBA and its players later approved a plan to restart the season in late July, setting up the NBA Bubble at Walt Disney World to protect teams from the virus. The games were played in the Bubble behind closed doors at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Bay Lake, Florida, with the Finals being played from September 30 through October 11. The Finals marked the conclusion of the NBA Bubble, which recorded no COVID-19 cases for the participating teams. The 2020 Finals was the latest to begin (beating the 1999 edition which began on June 16) and the first one played in September and October, and as well held in the fall.\nBackground.\nSeason suspension and restart.\nOn March 11, 2020, the NBA announced the suspension of the 2019–20 season following a report that Utah Jazz All-Star center Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19 just hours before the Jazz road game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. On June 4, the NBA Board of Governors approved 29–1 (the Portland Trail Blazers were the lone dissenter) resuming the 2019–20 season at Walt Disney World. The National Basketball Players Association approved the plan a day later. Under the plan, thirteen Western Conference teams and nine Eastern Conference teams, which include all clubs within six games of a playoff spot, played eight regular-season \"seeding\" games. A possible play-in tournament for the eighth seed in each conference would then be held if the ninth seed finished the regular season within four games of the eighth seed (this play-in tournament was used in the Western conference only). The 2020 NBA playoffs were then played as a conventional post-season tournament.\nMiami Heat.\nDuring the off-season, the Heat agreed to a four-way trade with the Los Angeles Clippers, Portland Trail Blazers, and the Philadelphia 76ers to acquire All-Star small forward Jimmy Butler from the 76ers.\nMiami began the season with two undrafted players in their starting lineup, Kendrick Nunn and Duncan Robinson. In his first season with the Heat, Butler was named an All-Star for the fifth time in his career, and Bam Adebayo received his first selection, giving Miami two players in an All-Star Game for the first time since Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade in the 2015–16 season. Before the season was suspended, the Heat clinched both their first playoff berth and Southeast Division title since the 2017–18 season. After the season resumed, they earned the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference. The Heat swept the Indiana Pacers in the first round of the playoffs, upset the No. 1 seed Milwaukee Bucks in five games in the Eastern Conference semifinals, and defeated the 3rd-seed Boston Celtics in six games in the Eastern Conference Finals to become the first fifth-seeded team to reach the NBA Finals. Only three other times had a lower seed reached the Finals: the Houston Rockets at No. 6 in 1981 and 1995, and the No. 8 New York Knicks in 1999.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nThe Lakers were coming off of a disappointing season in 2018–19 in which they extended their playoff drought which began in 2014. Their major free agent acquisition, LeBron James, suffered the first major injury in his career, and he missed the playoffs for the first time since 2005. On the final day of the season, Magic Johnson resigned as president of basketball operations, and head coach Luke Walton and the team mutually agreed to part ways a few days later. During the offseason, general manager Rob Pelinka hired Frank Vogel as the Lakers' new head coach, and he acquired six-time All-Star power forward Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans in a three-way trade that also included the Washington Wizards. Pelinka was promoted to vice president of basketball operations in January 2020, while still retaining his GM role. Later in the month, legendary former Lakers guard Kobe Bryant was killed in a helicopter crash along with his daughter Gianna and seven others. The Lakers dedicated the season to him.\nThe Lakers clinched their first playoff berth since the 2012–13 season in March 2020, days before the season was suspended. It ended the longest drought in the franchise's history. After play resumed in the bubble, the Lakers clinched both their first Pacific Division title since 2012 and the top seed in the Western Conference playoffs for the first time since the 2009–10 season. James and Davis were runner-ups for the NBA Most Valuable Player and NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award, respectively, behind Giannis Antetokounmpo, and both were named to the All-NBA First Team.\nThe Lakers needed five games each to defeat the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the playoffs, the Houston Rockets in the Western Conference semifinals, and the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals. The Lakers reached the Finals for the first time since 2010, while James was making his ninth trip in 10 seasons.\nRegular season series.\nThe Lakers won the regular season series 2–0.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nThe Lakers' Anthony Davis had 34 points, nine rebounds and five assists in his first Finals game, and LeBron James added a near triple-double with 25 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists to lead Los Angeles to a 116–98 win over Miami. The Heat led 23–10 in the middle of the first quarter before the Lakers outscored them 55–25 to lead by 17 at halftime. The Lakers expanded their lead to as high as 32 points in the third quarter. They made 13 of their first 20 three-point field goals in the game before cooling off and missing 16 of their last 18.\nMiami's Jimmy Butler twisted his left ankle before the end of the first half, but he remained in the game and finished with 23 points. Heat guard Goran Dragić did not play in the second half due to a foot injury. Miami center Bam Adebayo also did not finish the game after exiting in the third quarter with a shoulder injury. Dwight Howard remained as the Lakers' starting center after he moved into the starting lineup for the last few games of the conference finals against Denver.\nGame 2.\nJames scored 33 points and Davis added 32, leading the Lakers to a 2–0 series lead with a 124–114 win over the Heat. James and Davis became the first pair of Lakers teammates to each score 30 points in a Finals game since Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal in Game 3 of the 2002 NBA Finals. The team shot 51% for the game and made 22 of their first 25 two-point field goals, including a stretch of 16 straight towards the end of the first period through late in the third. Davis made 14 of his first 15 shots. Miami played short-handed without their injured starters Adebayo (neck and left shoulder) and Dragić (torn left plantar fascia).\nThe Lakers led by six points after the first quarter even though they made just three of 12 three-point attempts. Trailing by 14 at the half, the Heat scored 39 points in the third period but still were down 10 entering the fourth. They never got closer than 10 in the final period. Rajon Rondo had 16 points, while Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Kyle Kuzma also added 11 for the Lakers. The Lakers made 16 out of a season-high 47 three-pointers. Their starters made just seven of 28 with Caldwell-Pope and Danny Green combining to make three of 19. The team made 66% of its two-point attempts.\nMiami was led by Butler with 25 points and Kelly Olynyk with 24 off the bench. Tyler Herro and Meyers Leonard replaced Dragić and Adebayo in the starting lineup. Herro became the youngest player to start an NBA Finals game at 20 years, 256 days. He was eight days younger than Magic Johnson was when he started Game 1 for the Lakers in 1980 against the Philadelphia 76ers.\nGame 3.\nButler finished with 40 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists for a triple-double to lead Miami to a 115–104 win as Heat starters Adebayo and Dragić remained sidelined. Miami led for most of the game. At multiple points, they looked to be taking control of the game, but the Lakers would answer. The Heat led by 13 in the first quarter before the Lakers rallied to take the lead five minutes later. Miami began the second half with a 10–0 run to lead by 14, but Los Angeles responded with eight straight points. The Heat were up 12 late in the third quarter before the Lakers outscored them 20–6 to regain the lead 91–89 with 8:55 remaining in the game. However, the Heat outscored the Lakers 26–13 to finish the game and cut the Lakers' lead to 2–1.\nButler became the third player in Finals history to record a 40+ point triple-double, joining James (then with the Cleveland Cavaliers) in 2015 and Jerry West with the Lakers in 1969. Butler also became the first player to have more points, rebounds and assists in a Finals game than James, who finished with 25 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. Davis, who was in foul trouble early, was held to just 15 points and five rebounds. The Lakers committed 20 turnovers, which led to 21 points for the Heat. Los Angeles had 10 turnovers in the first quarter, the most of any team in the league during the season in the first period, including eight combined by James and Davis, who ended the game with eight and five turnovers, respectively. Herro and Olynyk both scored 17 points for Miami, while Kyle Kuzma and Markieff Morris both had 19 points off the bench for the Lakers. Miami's starters outscored the Lakers' starters 89–51.\nGame 4.\nDavis made a 3-pointer with 39.5 seconds remaining to give the Lakers a nine-point lead and securing the game en route to a 102–96 win and a 3–1 lead over the Heat. James had 28 points, eight assists and 12 rebounds, while Davis finished with 22 points, four assists and nine rebounds. Los Angeles was sloppy again with nine first-half turnovers, including five by James alone. With 8:18 remaining in the third quarter, James made a 3-pointer which put the Lakers ahead 55–54. The Lakers did not trail for the final 20 minutes, though Miami would remain close throughout. With 3:05 left in the game, Butler shot a corner 3-pointer that rimmed out which would have given the Heat the lead. Seven seconds later, Caldwell-Pope made a corner 3 to give the Lakers a 93–88 lead. Miami then committed a shot-clock violation, and Caldwell-Pope drove for a basket for a seven-point lead.\nCaldwell-Pope contributed 15 points and Green scored 10 for the Lakers. Butler ended with 22 points, nine assists and 10 rebounds for the Heat. He made his first five shots for 11 points in the first quarter but did not make another field goal until the fourth quarter while being guarded by Davis and James. Herro had 21 points, Duncan Robinson scored 17 and Adebayo added 15 for the Heat after missing two games.\nGame 5.\nButler had 35 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists to lead Miami to a 111–108 win and stave off elimination, bringing the series to 3–2. The Heat weathered a dominant performance by James, who ended with 40 points on just 21 shots, 13 rebounds and seven assists. With the Lakers down by one and 18.8 seconds remaining in the game, James drove into the paint, where he was surrounded by Butler and Robinson with a third defender also approaching. James passed to a wide-open Green at the top of the key, but Green missed a 3-pointer with 7.1 seconds left. Morris got the offensive rebound, pump-faked, but then threw the ball out of bounds with 2.2 seconds remaining in an attempt to get the ball to Davis under the basket.\nWith 48 seconds left in the first quarter, Davis was kicked by Miami's Andre Iguodala in his right heel, which aggravated a contusion he received in the conference finals. After lying on the floor for minutes, Davis exited the game and began the second quarter on the bench, which helped the Heat amass a 11-point lead. The Lakers drew close to make it 60–56 at the half. Caldwell-Pope, who scored 16 points, made a 3-pointer to give the Lakers the lead in the fourth quarter. With 3:13 remaining, Robinson made a three-pointer to give the Heat a two-point lead, which began a run of either a tie or a lead change on the game's next nine scoring possessions, including six straight where James and Butler traded scores.\nRobinson ended with 26 points, including seven 3-pointers, which broke Gary Neal's record set in 2013 for most 3's by an undrafted player in the Finals. Butler was exhausted towards the end, having rested just 48 seconds all game while also guarding James and sometimes Davis on defense. He became the second player with multiple 30-point triple-doubles in the same Finals series, joining James in 2015. Butler was the sixth player with multiple triple-doubles in the same Finals series along with James, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Wilt Chamberlain and Draymond Green. He also became the first with 35 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists and five steals in a Finals game, and he was just the second NBA player to reach those marks in the playoffs, joining Gary Payton in 2000. Davis scored 28 points and added 12 rebounds for the Lakers. By the end of the game, he was noticeably limping after another tumble around the basket. He and James scored 68 of the team's 108 points. They combined to shoot 24 for 36, while the other Lakers were 14 for 46.\nGame 6.\nJames had 28 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists to lead the Lakers to a 106–93 win for their 17th league championship in franchise history and first since 2010. James was named the Finals MVP for the fourth time in his career. Winning the fourth championship of his career, he became the only player in NBA history to have been named Finals MVP with three different franchises. He won the award in a unanimous 11–0 vote.\nLakers head coach Frank Vogel decided to start with a smaller, quicker lineup, inserting guard Alex Caruso for Howard and moving Davis to center. Los Angeles never trailed in the game and ended the first quarter ahead 28–20. They outscored Miami 36–16 in the second period and led by as many as 30 points in the first half. The Lakers' 64–36 halftime lead was the second-largest margin at halftime in Finals history, behind a 30-point lead by Boston over the Lakers in Game 1 in 1985. The Lakers also became the first NBA team to be undefeated in a season when leading entering the fourth quarter, going a combined 57–0 in the regular season and playoffs.\nDavis had 19 points and 15 rebounds. Adebayo led Miami with 25 points and 10 rebounds. Butler was held to only 12 points, but added eight assists and seven rebounds. Dragić, who returned from his Game 1 injury, had five points off the bench on 2-of-8 shooting along with five rebounds in 19 minutes.\nJames ended the series averaging 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds and 8.5 assists per game. He and Davis became the first teammates in NBA history to both average 25 points and shoot 50% from the field in the same postseason. Butler became only the second player in a Finals series to lead his team outright in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks, joining James in 2016 with the Cavaliers.\nWith the Dodgers winning the World Series later in the month, Los Angeles repeated its achievement of having NBA and World Series champions in the same year, as both the Lakers and Dodgers had won in 1988. \nPlayer statistics.\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left; background:#FDE910\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\nSponsorship.\nAs part of a multiyear partnership that began in 2018, the internet television service YouTube TV was the presenting sponsor of the series. The \"2020 NBA Finals Presented by YouTube TV\" logo was prominently displayed at center court, with \"Black Lives Matter\" text featured above the midcourt logo (as it had been since the start of the NBA Bubble as part of the league and players' activism in response to the George Floyd protests), while Walt Disney World script logos were placed outside opposing lane lines on each side.\nMedia coverage.\nIn the United States, the Finals were televised by ABC in English and ESPN Deportes in Spanish.\nLike before, Mike Breen, Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy served as commentators on ABC, with Rachel Nichols on the sideline. After spending the past 11 Finals as a sideline reporter on television, Doris Burke joined the ESPN Radio commentary team, which included Marc Kestecher and Jon Barry, making her first woman to call the NBA Finals on the radio.\nGame 5 of the Finals was the first NBA game to be aired on China Central Television (CCTV) in China since the disagreement between the NBA and that country over the Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweet in support of the Hong Kong anti-government protesters. NBA games had remained available for streaming on Tencent.\nViewership.\nThe 2020 NBA Finals continued the trend of declining viewership, with 7.41 million people watching Game 1, making it the lowest rated and least-watched NBA Finals game on record (tracking viewership started in 1988). It aired opposite two Major League Baseball playoff games. The drop followed the shift in other sporting events rescheduled from their traditional times of year, such as the Stanley Cup Finals, the Kentucky Derby, the U.S. Open and the Indianapolis 500. The viewership further declined to a new record low of 6.609 million for Game 2. Despite the lows, both Game 1 and Game 2 were the most watched program for their respective days. Game 3, which aired opposite NBC's \"Sunday Night Football\" coverage, had its viewership continue to decrease to a new record low of approximately 5.94 million.\nAftermath.\nThe local victory parade for the Lakers was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti stated on October 28, the day after the Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series, that there would be separate public celebrations for both teams, though it was uncertain how mandated social distancing would be addressed. As of April 2024, no public celebrations have taken place for either team.\nThe Heat would return to the NBA Finals 3 years later in 2023 but were ultimately defeated by the Denver Nuggets in five games. Prior to that the Nuggets had swept the Lakers in the Conference Finals that same year en route to winning their first-ever NBA championship."

        "text": "The Philippines men's national basketball team competed in the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup which was held in China from August 31 to September 15, 2019. This is the Philippines second straight appearance in the FIBA Basketball World Cup since its participation in the 2014 edition hosted in Spain.\nThe team during the Asian qualifiers was initially coached by Chot Reyes and, later, Yeng Guiao. The team's qualification bid suffered a setback when the team still coached by Reyes was involved in a brawl with Australia which led to the suspension of players and officials forcing the Philippines to change its roster for the subsequent qualifier games.\nExhibition games.\nThe schedule of the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) season is one of the factors weighed in organizing exhibition games as preparation of the Philippine national team for the FIBA Basketball World Cup since majority of its players participate in the league. For this reason the Philippines' basketball federation, the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP), decided against the team's participation in the 2019 William Jones Cup due to conflicting schedule with the PBA. A pocket national teams' tournament to be held in Metro Manila was planned.\nPlaying at least a match Australia was considered which was also intended as a goodwill measure to rebuild trust between the two national teams following the Philippines–Australia brawl. However, Australia informed their Philippine counterparts that their schedule is already full so a scrimmage is not possible prior to the 2019 FIBA World Cup. Exhibition matches was considered against South Korea and New Zealand.\nThe PBA Board also approved on April 25, 2019, a four-day training camp for the Philippine national team in Russia where they are expected to play games against local teams along with consenting their players to participate in twice-a-week practices in June and July. However, the Russian camp was cancelled after the Russian basketball federation could only commit one single tune-up match.\nSpain training camp.\nThe Philippine national team had a training camp in Spain where they played tune ups against the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Ivory Coast in Guadalajara. After the two games they participated in a pocket tournament in Spain, which also involved the two African teams and the hosts. The Philippines won their games against their two African opponents prior to the tournament. The tournament in Malaga had the Philippines tie up with DR Congo and the Ivory Coast with Spain. The winner of the two ties contested in the final while the losers played for third place. The Philippines lost their second matchup against the DR Congo conceding an opportunity to play Spain which won over other African team in the pocket tournament.\n11 players out of the 19-man shortlist participated in the Spain training camp with majority of the players missing out are from 2019 PBA Commissioner's Cup finalists TNT KaTropa and San Miguel Beermen. Raymond Almazan who had his visa application denied, Jordan Clarkson, Stanley Pringle who is nursing a slight ankle injury, did not join the camp. Kiefer Ravena while part of the 11 players participating did not play in any of the tune up matches against national teams due to serving a FIBA suspension which is due to end a week prior to the world cup.\nTune up matches at home.\nThe first tune up game of the Philippine national team was against the 2019 William Jones Cup-bound local side Mighty Sports. Their game against the club ended in a draw with both teams scoring 85 points. The national team also had a scrimmage against the NLEX Road Warriors of the Philippine Basketball Association playing four 25-minute, first to 21-points games against the professional team. NLEX won the first set with the national team winning the next three sets.\nShortly before leaving for China, the national team had two tune-up matches against the Adelaide 36ers at the Meralco Gym in Pasig on August 23 and 25, 2019. The national team won 92–83 over the Adelaide-based professional team and conceded a 75–85 loss in the second game. Ravena after serving his 18-month FIBA suspension played in the second game.\nRoster.\nThe PBA has committed its players' participation in the FIBA Basketball World Cup. It was decided that the Philippines will field two separate teams for the intercontinental competition and the 2019 Southeast Asian Games, which the country will host. The SBP negotiated for FIBA's recognition of Jordan Clarkson of the Cleveland Cavaliers' eligibility to play as a \"local player\" rather than a \"naturalized\" player. Head coach Yeng Guiao decided not to include Clarkson in the final roster due to the absence of a FIBA decision that would allow him to play as a local player.\nA training pool was formed from where the team's coaching staff selected players from. Players who were invited to the pool includes Robert Bolick, Gabe Norwood, June Mar Fajardo, Marcio Lassiter, Troy Rosario, Paul Lee, Raymond Almazan, Japeth Aguilar, CJ Perez, Kiefer Ravena, and Matthew Wright. Beau Belga and Stanley Pringle despite not being part of the pool also took part in training sessions. By June 5, 2019, no additional players are being invited to the pool.\nA shortlist of 19 players was announced by the national federation which includes Blatche, Clarkson, and Pringle who are considered naturalized players by FIBA. The final 12-man roster was officially announced to the public on August 25, 2019, after the second tune up game of the national team against the Adelaide 36ers, with Poy Erram, Matthew Wright and Marcio Lassiter not making into the final squad due to injuries. 2014 FIBA World Cup holdovers, Andray Blatche, June Mar Fajardo, and Japeth Aguilar are part of the roster.\nThe following were candidates to make the team: \nJayson Castro who was not included in the training pool reportedly opted out in July 2019 from the national team's preparations due to undisclosed personal reasons.\nGroup phase.\nThe Philippines was drawn into Group D with Serbia, Italy, and Angola and played all of its group phase matches in Foshan at the Foshan International Sports and Cultural Center from August 31 to September 4. During this round, the national team was billeted at the Hilton Foshan Hotel which is situated from the indoor arena. The Philippine national team left Manila by plane for Guangzhou, China on August 29, 2019, and after arriving in the Guangdong province capital departed for Foshan via bus.\nThe Philippines hoped to progress to the next round with the tie against Italy and Angola tagged as crucial by head coach Yeng Guiao. Expectations of winning against Serbia was tempered but Guiao hoped for the team to win against Italy. Assuming the Philippines won over Italy and lose to Serbia, Guiao said that the Philippines had to win against Angola or the hypothetical win over Italy would have been rendered as \"useless\".\nGuiao also sent his assistants Sandy Arespacochaga and Ford Arao to China ahead of the rest of the team and tasked them to do scouting on Serbia and Italy which played a tune up game against each other on August 23, 2019.\n\"All times are local UTC+8.\"\nItaly.\nThis was the second game between the Philippines and Italy in the World Cup with the Italians winning on their first meeting in 1978. The two teams last played each other in the 2016 Imperial Basketball City Tournament as part of the Philippines' preparation for the 2016 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament where the Italians won over the Filipinos by 36 points.\nThe Philippines lost their opener 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup game against Italy. The Philippines's opening campaign was marred by poor shooting performance with Filipinos only successfully executed three of the 23 three pointer attempts and the first three points made with 7:03 left in the fourth quarter. In contrast, the Italians accomplished 15 of their 31 three-pointer attempts and made 30 assists compared to 10 assists by the Filipinos. Philippines Head coach Yeng Guiao also concluded that team made too much turnovers.\nThe Philippines trailed heavily as early as the end of first quarter with the team only scoring 8 points compared to the 37 points made by the Italians.\nSerbia.\nThis was the first competitive game between Serbia and the Philippines.\nSerbia had a slow start to the game and the Philippines tried to grow in the confidence. Tied at 7-all with six minutes left in the opening quarter, center Nikola Jokić came off the bench and the Serbian offense started to roll. The Serbs used a 7–0 run to close the first 10 minutes with a 25–13 lead. Forward Nemanja Bjelica came off the bench making all 7 of his field-goal attempts, including 3 three-pointers to finish with a game-high 20 points in just 16 minutes of action. Serbia not only out-rebounded Philippines 37–23, but they finished with 37 assists against Philippines' 14.\nThis is the game won by largest points margin at 59 for the Serbians at any of major tournaments since 2006. With 37 team assists Serbia set the World Cup record for the most assists in a single game.\nAngola.\nThis was the first competitive game between Angola and the Philippines.\nUnlike in games against Italy and Serbia which ended in heavy defeats, the Philippines performed relatively better against Angola. While Angola lead throughout most of regulation time, the Philippines kept the gap to a manageable levels trailing 12 points at most. By the time when there was only 2:33 of time remaining in the fourth quarter, the Philippines were leading Angola 70–67. Angolan player Carlos Morais restored the Angolan lead rendering the scoreline 70–73. CJ Perez tied the game by scoring a three pointer but the Philippines failed to score further baskets forcing the game to go overtime. However the Philippines failed to secure the win in overtime.\nClassification round.\nThe Philippines finished last among four teams in Group C and was grouped with Angola, Iran and Tunisia in Group N in the classification round. The Philippines played games against the latter two in Beijing with the result of their loss to Angola carrying over. Had they progressed to the second round as one of the top two finishers of Group C, they would have played against Puerto Rico and Spain in Wuhan.\nTunisia.\nThe Philippines' bid to qualify for the 2020 Summer Olympics as the best Asian team in the 2019 FIBA World Cup ended when Tunisia defeated them. Tunisia led the Philippines early with the first quarter ending in a 27–10 scoreline in favor of the North Africans.\nIran.\nThe Philippines' last game in the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup is against Iran. The Philippines lost both of its two 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifier games to Iran; a 73–81 defeat in Tehran and a 70–78 loss at home in Pasay. Iran was coming off from a 71–62 win against Angola, their first in the tournament, and was still in contention for a berth at the 2020 Summer Olympics while the Philippines was looking to secure at least a win.\nThe Philippines kept the game close in the first quarter trailing only a point, 25–24, with 37.5 seconds left in the clock with its players successfully executing six of its eleven attempted three pointers. However the first quarter ended 30–24 in favor of Iran. CJ Perez restored the close gap of 34–31 in the second quarter but the first half ended in a 48–34 score still favoring Iran. Iran was leading the Philippines by 23 points, 64–41, with 4:10 left in the third quarter with the Philippines unable to restore at least a small gap in the scoreline. Mid-way in the fourth quarter Andray Blatche was fouled out after incurring two technical fouls after he argued with the referees regarding an alleged foul on him.\nAftermath.\nThe Philippines ended their 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup campaign without a win after playing five games, finishing dead last as a result of their poor performance. They also didn't manage to clinch the single outright Asian berth for the 2020 Summer Olympics by failing to finish as the best performing team from FIBA Asia with Iran, the Philippines' last opponent claiming the berth instead. The only route for the Philippines to qualify for the Summer Olympics is to get invited as one of the two Asian wildcard teams for the Olympic qualifying tournaments. An invite was not given, thus extending their drought in participation in the Olympic basketball tournament. Eventually, however, the country was invited to the 2020 FIBA Men's Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Belgrade as New Zealand withdrew from the tournament, opening up a spot as the next highest ranked Asian team. The country finished its OQT campaign with losses to Serbia and the Dominican Republic, the former of which was by a close margin.\nHead coach Yeng Guiao cited the lack of preparation as the reason for the Philippines' dismal performance in the world cup and reasoned that preparation should be started years prior to the tournament but added that the team did their best despite \"limitations\". He also suggested that the national team should gain more experience playing against teams outside Asia particularly European and Latin American teams.\nGuiao eventually resigned as the team's head coach.\nTim Cone became the new head coach of the Philippines, who clinched the gold medal in the Men's basketball tournament of the 2019 Southeast Asian Games, which the country hosted. The team's gold medal victory contributed to the country's medal haul of 149 gold medals, out of the 387 medals won by the Philippines.\nSince then, Jong Uichico and Tab Baldwin had stints as head coach of the country, the latter of which guided the team in their 3-0 run in the final window of the 2022 FIBA Asia Cup qualifiers and the 2020 FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament. Since February 2022, former national team coach Chot Reyes has been at the helm of the national team.\nThe Philippines is set to participate in the next edition of the World Cup in 2023, as one of the hosts, taking on 2019 foes Angola and Italy, and 2020 OQT opponents the Dominican Republic in the group phase.\nUnder Reyes' current stint as head coach, the team also participated in the 2022 FIBA Asia Cup in Jakarta, Indonesia, finishing 9th, and participated in the qualification process for the 2023 World Cup, finishing 2nd and 3rd in the first round and second round respectively, albeit being automatically qualified as one of the hosts. The team also finished silver in the 2021 Southeast Asian Games for the first time since 1989, losing to Indonesia, but reclaimed the gold medal at the 2023 edition in Cambodia."

        "text": "The 2019–20 European Rugby Champions Cup (known as the Heineken Champions Cup for sponsorship reasons) was the sixth season of the European Rugby Champions Cup, the annual club rugby union competition run by European Professional Club Rugby (ECPR) for teams from the top six nations in European rugby. It was the 25th season of pan-European professional club rugby competition.\nThe tournament began on 15 November 2019. The knock-out stage of the tournament was rescheduled from April and May to September and October 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the final, originally scheduled for 23 May 2020 at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille in France, taking place on 17 October 2020 at Ashton Gate in Bristol.\nTeams.\nTwenty clubs from the three major European domestic and regional leagues competed in the Champions Cup. Nineteen of these qualified directly as a result of their league performance. The final place was awarded in the following order:\nThe distribution of teams is:\nThe following teams qualified for the tournament.\nTeam details.\nBelow is the list of coaches, captain and stadiums with their method of qualification for each team.\nSeeding.\nThe twenty competing teams are seeded and split into four tiers, each containing five teams.\nFor the purpose of creating the tiers, clubs are ranked based on their domestic league performances and on their qualification for the knockout phases of their championships, so a losing quarter-finalist in the Top 14 would be seeded below a losing semi-finalist, even if they finished above them in the regular season.\nBased on these seedings, teams are placed into one of the four tiers, with the top-seeded clubs being put in Tier 1. The nature of the tier system means that a draw is needed to allocate two of the three second-seed clubs to Tier 1. The fourth-seed team from the same domestic league as the second-seed team which was put in Tier 2 will also be placed in Tier 2. Brackets show each team's seeding and their league. e.g. \"1 Top 14\" indicates the team was the top seed from the Top 14.\nThe following restrictions will apply to the draw:\nPool stage.\nThe draw took place on 19 June 2019, in Lausanne, Switzerland.\nTeams in the same pool play each other twice, at home and away, in the group stage that begins on the weekend of 15–17 November 2019, and continues through to 17–19 January 2020. The five pool winners and three best runners-up progress to the quarter finals.\nTeams are awarded group points based on match performances. Four points are awarded for a win, two points for a draw, one attacking bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match and one defensive bonus point for losing a match by seven points or fewer.\nIn the event of a tie between two or more teams, the following tie-breakers are used, as directed by EPCR:\nSeason records.\nTeam.\n44–3 Saracens at home to Ospreys on 23 November 2019\n45–7 Glasgow Warriors away to Sale Sharks on 18 January 2020\n53–21 Clermont at home to Harlequins on 16 November 2019\nClermont at home to Bath on 15 December 2019\nClermont at home to Harlequins on 16 November 2019&lt;br&gt;\nLeinster at home to Northampton Saints on 14 December 2019&lt;br&gt;\nClermont at home to Bath on 15 December 2019&lt;br&gt;\nGlasgow Warriors away to Sale Sharks on 18 January 2020\nNorthampton Saints at home to Lyon on 17 November 2019\nToulouse away to Gloucester on 15 November 2019&lt;br&gt;\nConnacht away to Toulouse on 23 November 2019&lt;br&gt;\nClermont at home to Ulster on 11 January 2020\nPlayer.\n Dan Biggar for Northampton Saints at home to Lyon on 17 November 2019\n Garry Ringrose for Leinster at home to Benetton on 16 November 2019&lt;br&gt;\n Garry Ringrose for Leinster at home to Northampton Saints on 14 December 2019\n Adam Hastings for Glasgow Warriors away to Sale Sharks on 18 January 2020\n Dan Biggar for Northampton Saints at home to Lyon on 17 November 2019\n Zack Holmes for Toulouse away to Gloucester on 15 November 2019&lt;br&gt;\n Conor Fitzgerald for Connacht away to Toulouse on 23 November 2019&lt;br&gt;\n Camille Lopez for Clermont at home to Ulster on 11 January 2020\nAttendances.\nLeinster at home to Northampton Saints on 14 December 2019\nBenetton at home to Lyon on 14 December 2019\nLeinster\nBenetton"

Despite Hudson absence, KR defeated ÍS 85–79, behind Jón Sigurðsson 28 points, and kept their championship hopes alive.\nOn March 25, Hudson won the Icelandic Cup after KR beat long time nemesis ÍR, led by Paul Stewart, in the Cup final. In the game, which had heavy police presence due to violence by supporters in the stands at recent games, Hudson scored a team high 19 points.\nOn March 29, Hudson scored the game winning basket, with 32 seconds remaining, against Valur, securing KR's second consecutive national championship. In the game, he scored a team high 34 points.

In 1953 however, the Paraguayan's scored two early goals in the play-off, and led 3–0 by half-time, winning the match 3–2.\n1979 Copa América.\n1979 was the second edition of a revised Copa América which was not held as a local tournament, but spread over several months in a number of home-and-away-matches. In the group phase, opponent Uruguay slipped up in their first match against Ecuador, losing 1–2, and were held at bay by Paraguay with two draws. A closely contested semi-final saw Paraguay win 4–3 on aggregate over Brazil.\nThe rules for the final against Chile were that a play-off on neutral ground was to be played if the teams were equal on points after two legs. Goal difference would only come into play if the play-off also ended in a draw. After a 3–0 home win, but a 1–0 away defeat, the play-off was scheduled in Buenos Aires six days later. Drawing 0–0, Paraguay won on aggregate goals after that play-off. In total, Paraguay had to play nine matches to be crowned champions, a tournament record tied with Peru, who went through a similar ordeal four years earlier.\nRecord by opponent.\nParaguay's highest victory at a Copa América was a 7–0 against Bolivia in 1949. Their highest defeat was a 0–8 against Argentina in 1926.\nAwards and records.\nTeam Awards\nIndividual Awards"

It was the 108th edition of the Australian Open, the 52nd in the Open Era, and the first Grand Slam of the year. The tournament consisted of events for professional players in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Junior and wheelchair players competed in singles and doubles tournaments. As in previous years, the tournament's main sponsor was Kia.\nNovak Djokovic and Naomi Osaka were the defending champions in Men's Singles and Women's Singles, respectively. Osaka lost in the third round to Coco Gauff. In contrast, Djokovic successfully defended his title by defeating Dominic Thiem to win the tournament for a record-extending eighth time.\nPrior to this edition of the Australian Open, the supplier of the hard courts was changed to GreenSet, though the court surface and color remained the same.This is one of the few sporting events held in 2020 which was unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTournament.\nThe 2020 Australian Open was the 108th edition of the tournament, held at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.\nThe tournament is run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and is part of the 2020 ATP Tour and the 2020 WTA Tour calendars under the Grand Slam category. The tournament consists of both men's and women's singles and doubles draws as well as the mixed doubles events. There are singles and doubles events for both boys and girls (players under 18), which are part of the Grade A category of tournaments. There are also singles, doubles and quad events for men's and women's wheelchair tennis players as part of the NEC tour under the Grand Slam category.\nThe tournament is played on hard courts and is taking place across a series of 25 courts, the three main show courts Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne Arena and Margaret Court Arena. 1573 Arena (formerly Show Court Two) was upgraded into a main show court.\nImpact of bushfires.\nThe bushfires that had burned large portions of Australia for months left a smoke haze over Melbourne on the first day of qualifying. That day, the air over Melbourne was rated as the worst in the world. In qualifying, play was delayed, some players called for medical timeouts, and Dalila Jakupović was forced to retire, due to a coughing fit brought on by the poor air quality.\nThe tournament held a Rally for Relief similar to the one of 2011 before the tournament to raise money to aid areas devastated by the bushfires. Novak Djokovic, Coco Gauff, Petra Kvitová, Rafael Nadal, Naomi Osaka, Dominic Thiem, Stefanos Tsitsipas, and Alexander Zverev all played a doubles format match with Serena Williams and Caroline Wozniacki as team captains. Roger Federer and Nick Kyrgios later played a one set singles match where Federer prevailed.\nPoint distribution and prize money.\nPoint distribution.\nBelow is a series of tables for each of the competitions showing the ranking points offered for each event.\nPrize money.\nThe Australian Open total prize money for 2020 was increased by 13.6% to a tournament record A$71,000,000.\nExternal links.\n "

        "title": "Boxing career of Muhammad Ali",
        "text": "Muhammad Ali was a boxer who mastered the rope-a-dope fighting technique. He is widely regarded by many boxing commentators and historians as the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time. Boxing magazine \"The Ring\" named him number one in a 1998 ranking of greatest heavyweights from all eras. In 1999, \"The Associated Press\" voted Ali the number one heavyweight of the 20th century.\nIn 1999, Ali was named the second greatest boxer in the history of combat sports, pound for pound by ESPN. He was only behind the welterweight and middleweight legend Sugar Ray Robinson. In December 2007, ESPN placed Ali second in its choice of the greatest heavyweights of all time, behind Joe Louis. He was inducted in the International Boxing Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 1990.\nEarly career.\nClay made his professional debut on October 29, 1960, winning a six-round decision over Tunney Hunsaker. From then until the end of 1963, Clay amassed a record of 19–0 with 15 wins by knockout. He defeated boxers including Tony Esperti, Jim Robinson, Donnie Fleeman, Alonzo Johnson, George Logan, Willi Besmanoff, LaMar Clark, Doug Jones and Henry Cooper. Clay also beat his former trainer and veteran boxer Archie Moore in a 1962 match.\nThese early fights were not without trials. Clay was knocked down by both Sonny Banks and Cooper. In the Cooper fight, Clay was floored by a left hook at the end of round four, and was groggy when he got up at the count of three. However, the round had ended by the time he rose, and he recovered between rounds, going on to win in the predicted 5th round due to Cooper's severely cut eye. The fight with Doug Jones on March 13, 1963, was Clay's toughest fight during this stretch. The number two and three heavyweight contenders respectively, Clay and Jones fought on Jones' home turf at New York's Madison Square Garden. Jones staggered Clay in the first round, and the unanimous decision for Clay was greeted by boos and a rain of debris thrown into the ring. Watching on closed-circuit TV, heavyweight champ Sonny Liston quipped that if he fought Clay he might get locked up for murder. The fight was later named \"Fight of the Year\" by \"The Ring\" magazine.\nIn each of these fights, Clay vocally belittled his opponents and vaunted his abilities. He called Jones \"an ugly little man\" and Cooper a \"bum.\" He said he was embarrassed to get in the ring with Alex Miteff and claimed that Madison Square Garden was \"too small for me.\" His provocative and outlandish behavior in the ring was inspired by professional wrestler \"Gorgeous George\" Wagner. Ali stated in a 1969 interview with the Associated Press' Hubert Mizel that he met with Gorgeous George in Las Vegas in 1961 and that the wrestler inspired him to use wrestling jargon when he did interviews.\nIn 1960, Clay left Moore's camp, partially due to his refusal to do chores such as washing dishes and sweeping. To replace Moore, Clay hired Angelo Dundee to be his trainer. Clay had met Dundee in February 1957 during Clay's amateur career. Around this time, Clay sought longtime idol Sugar Ray Robinson to be his manager, but was rebuffed.\nWorld heavyweight champion.\nFights against Liston.\nBy late 1963, Clay had become the top contender for Sonny Liston's title. The fight was set for February 25, 1964, in Miami Beach. Liston was an intimidating personality, a dominating fighter with a criminal past and ties to the mob. Based on Clay's uninspired performance against Jones and Cooper in his previous two fights, and Liston's destruction of former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson in two first-round knock outs, Clay was an 8:1 underdog. Despite this, Clay taunted Liston during the pre-fight buildup, dubbing him \"the big ugly bear\", stating \"Liston even smells like a bear\" and claiming \"After I beat him I'm going to donate him to the zoo.\" Clay turned the pre-fight weigh-in into a circus, shouting at Liston that \"someone is going to die at ringside tonight.\" Clay's pulse rate was measured at 120, more than double his normal 54. Many of those in attendance thought Clay's behavior stemmed from fear, and some commentators wondered if he would show up for the bout.\nThe outcome of the fight was a major upset. At the opening bell, Liston rushed at Clay, seemingly angry and looking for a quick knockout. However, Clay's superior speed and mobility enabled him to elude Liston, making the champion miss and look awkward. At the end of the first round, Clay opened up his attack and hit Liston repeatedly with jabs. Liston fought better in round two, but at the beginning of the third round Clay hit Liston with a combination that buckled his knees and opened a cut under his left eye. This was the first time Liston had ever been cut. At the end of round four, Clay was returning to his corner when he began experiencing blinding pain in his eyes and asked his trainer, Angelo Dundee, to cut off his gloves. Dundee refused. It has been speculated that the problem was due to ointment used to seal Liston's cuts, perhaps deliberately applied by his corner to his gloves. Though unconfirmed, boxing historian Bert Sugar claimed that two of Liston's opponents also complained about their eyes \"burning.\"\nDespite Liston's attempts to knock out a blinded Clay, Clay was able to survive the fifth round until sweat and tears rinsed the irritation from his eyes. In the sixth, Clay dominated, hitting Liston repeatedly. Liston did not answer the bell for the seventh round, and Clay was declared the winner by TKO. Liston stated that the reason he quit was an injured shoulder. Following the win, a triumphant Clay rushed to the edge of the ring and, pointing to the ringside press, shouted: \"Eat your words!\" He added, \"I am the greatest! I shook up the world. I'm the prettiest thing that ever lived.\"\nAt ringside post fight, Clay appeared unconvinced that the fight was stopped due to a Liston shoulder injury, saying that the only injury Liston had was \"an open eye, a big cut eye!\" When told by Joe Louis that the injury was a \"left arm thrown out of its socket,\" Clay quipped, \"Yeah, swinging at nothing, who wouldn't!\"\nIn winning this fight at the age of 22, Clay became the youngest boxer to take the title from a reigning heavyweight champion. However, Floyd Patterson remained the youngest to win the heavyweight championship, doing so at the age 21 during an elimination bout following Rocky Marciano's retirement. Mike Tyson broke both records in 1986 when he defeated Trevor Berbick to win the heavyweight title at age 20.\nSoon after the Liston fight, Clay changed his name to Cassius X, and then later to Muhammad Ali upon converting to Islam and affiliating with the Nation of Islam. Ali then faced a rematch with Liston scheduled for May 1965 in Lewiston, Maine. It had been scheduled for Boston the previous November, but was postponed for six months due to Ali's emergency surgery for a hernia three days before. The fight was controversial. Midway through the first round, Liston was knocked down by a difficult-to-see blow the press dubbed a \"phantom punch.\" Referee Jersey Joe Walcott did not begin the count immediately after the knockdown, as Ali refused to retreat to a neutral corner. Liston rose after he had been down for about 20 seconds, and the fight momentarily continued. However a few seconds later Walcott, having been informed by the timekeepers that Liston had been down for a count of 10, stopped the match and declared Ali the winner by knockout. The entire fight lasted less than two minutes.\nIt has since been speculated that Liston purposely dropped to the ground. Proposed motivations include threats on his life from the Nation of Islam, that he had bet against himself and that he \"took a dive\" to pay off debts. Slow-motion replays show that Liston was jarred by a chopping right from Ali, although it is unclear whether the blow was a genuine knockout punch.\nFight against Patterson.\nAli defended his title against former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson on November 22, 1965. Before the match, Ali mocked Patterson, who was widely known to call him by his former name Cassius Clay, as an \"Uncle Tom\", calling him \"The Rabbit\". Although Ali clearly had the better of Patterson, who appeared injured during the fight, the match lasted 12 rounds before being called on a technical knockout. Patterson later said he had strained his sacroiliac. Ali was criticized in the sports media for appearing to have toyed with Patterson during the fight. Patterson biographer W.K. Stratton claims that the conflict between Ali and Patterson was not genuine but was staged to increase ticket sales and the closed-circuit viewing audience, with both men complicit in the theatrics. Stratton also cites an interview by Howard Cosell in which Ali explained that rather than toying with Patterson, he refrained from knocking him out after it became apparent Patterson was injured. Patterson himself later said that he'd never been hit by punches as soft as Ali's. Stratton states that Ali arranged the second fight, in 1972, with the financially struggling Patterson to help the former champion earn enough money to pay a debt to the IRS.\nMain Bout.\nAfter the Patterson fight, Ali founded his own promotion company, Main Bout. The company handled Ali's boxing promotions and pay-per-view closed-circuit television broadcasts; its stockholders were mainly fellow Nation of Islam members, such as Jabir Herbert Muhammad and the chief aide to Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad, John Ali, along with several others, including Bob Arum, who later founded Top Rank.\nAli and then-WBA heavyweight champion boxer Ernie Terrell had agreed to meet for a bout in Chicago on March 29, 1966 (the WBA, one of two boxing associations, had stripped Ali of his title following his signing a rematch with Liston But in February Ali was reclassified by the Louisville draft board as 1-A from 1-Y, and he indicated that he would refuse to serve, commenting to the press, \"I ain't got nothing against no Viet Cong; no Viet Cong never called me nigger.\" Amidst the media and public outcry over Ali's stance, the Illinois Athletic Commission refused to sanction the fight, citing technicalities.\nInstead, Ali traveled to Canada and Europe and won championship bouts against George Chuvalo, Henry Cooper, Brian London and Karl Mildenberger.\nAli returned to the United States to fight Cleveland Williams in the Houston Astrodome on November 14, 1966. The bout drew a record-breaking indoor crowd of 35,460 people. Williams had once been considered among the hardest punchers in the heavyweight division, but in 1964 he had been shot at point-blank range with a .357 Magnum by a Texas policeman, resulting in the loss of one kidney and of his small intestine. Ali dominated Williams, winning a third-round technical knockout in what some consider the finest performance of his career.\nAli fought Terrell in Houston on February 6, 1967. Terrell, who was unbeaten in five years and had defeated many of the boxers Ali had faced, was billed as Ali's toughest opponent since Liston; he was big, strong and had a three-inch reach advantage over Ali. During the lead up to the bout, Terrell repeatedly called Ali \"Clay\", much to Ali's annoyance. The two almost came to blows over the name issue in a pre-fight interview with Howard Cosell. Ali seemed intent on humiliating Terrell. \"I want to torture him\", he said. \"A clean knockout is too good for him.\" The fight was close until the seventh round, when Ali bloodied Terrell and almost knocked him out. In the eighth round, Ali taunted Terrell, hitting him with jabs and shouting between punches, \"What's my name, Uncle Tom ... what's my name?\" Ali won a unanimous 15-round decision. Terrell claimed that early in the fight Ali deliberately thumbed him in the eye, forcing him to fight half-blind, and then, in a clinch, rubbed the wounded eye against the ropes. Because of Ali's apparent intent to prolong the fight to inflict maximum punishment, critics described the bout as \"one of the ugliest boxing fights.\" Tex Maule later wrote: \"It was a wonderful demonstration of boxing skill and a barbarous display of cruelty.\" Ali denied the accusations of cruelty but, for Ali's critics, the fight provided more evidence of his arrogance.\nAfter Ali's title defense against Zora Folley on March 22, he was stripped of his title due to his refusal to be drafted to army service. His boxing license was also suspended by the state of New York. He was convicted of draft evasion on June 20 and sentenced to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. He paid a bond and remained free while the verdict was being appealed.\nExile and comeback.\nIn March 1966, Ali refused to be inducted into the armed forces. He was systematically denied a boxing license in every state and stripped of his passport. As a result, he did not fight from March 1967 to October 1970—from ages 25 to almost 29—as his case worked its way through the appeals process before his conviction was overturned in 1971. During this time of inactivity, as opposition to the Vietnam War began to grow and Ali's stance gained sympathy, he spoke at colleges across the nation, criticizing the Vietnam War and advocating African-American pride and racial justice.\n\"The Super Fight\".\nWhile banned from sanctioned bouts, Ali settled a $1 million lawsuit against radio producer Murray Woroner by accepting $10,000 to appear in a privately staged fantasy fight against retired champion Rocky Marciano. In 1969 the boxers were filmed sparring for about 75 one-minute rounds; they acted out several different endings. A computer program purportedly determined the winner, based on data about the fighters. Edited versions of the bout were shown in movie theaters in 1970. In the U.S. version Ali lost in a simulated 13th-round knockout, but in the European version Marciano lost due to cuts, also simulated.\nAli suggested that prejudice determined his defeat in the U.S. version. He was reported to jokingly say, \"That computer was made in Alabama.\"\nReturn to prizefighting.\nOn August 11, 1970, with his case still in appeal, Ali was granted a license to box by the City of Atlanta Athletic Commission, thanks to State Senator Leroy R. Johnson. Ali's first return bout was against Jerry Quarry on October 26, resulting in a win after three rounds after Quarry was cut.\nA month earlier, a victory in federal court forced the New York State Boxing Commission to reinstate Ali's license. He fought Oscar Bonavena at Madison Square Garden in December, an uninspired performance that ended in a dramatic technical knockout of Bonavena in the 15th round. The win left Ali as a top contender against heavyweight champion Joe Frazier.\nFirst fight against Joe Frazier.\nAli and Frazier's first fight, held at the Garden on March 8, 1971, was nicknamed the \"Fight of the Century\", due to the tremendous excitement surrounding a bout between two undefeated fighters, each with a legitimate claim as heavyweight champions. Veteran boxing writer John Condon called it \"the greatest event I've ever worked on in my life.\" The bout was broadcast to 35 foreign countries; promoters granted 760 press passes.\nAdding to the atmosphere were the considerable pre-fight theatrics and name calling. Ali portrayed Frazier as a \"dumb tool of the white establishment.\" \"Frazier is too ugly to be champ\", Ali said. \"Frazier is too dumb to be champ.\" Ali also frequently called Frazier an \"Uncle Tom\". Dave Wolf, who worked in Frazier's camp, recalled that, \"Ali was saying 'the only people rooting for Joe Frazier are white people in suits, Alabama sheriffs, and members of the Ku Klux Klan. I'm fighting for the little man in the ghetto.' Joe was sitting there, smashing his fist into the palm of his hand, saying, 'What the fuck does he know about the ghetto?\nAli began training at a farm near Reading, Pennsylvania, in 1971 and, finding the country setting to his liking, sought to develop a real training camp in the countryside. He found a five-acre site on a Pennsylvania country road in the village of Deer Lake, Pennsylvania. On this site, Ali carved out what was to become his training camp, where he trained for all his fights from 1972 to the end of his career in 1981.\nThe Monday night fight lived up to its billing. In a preview of their two other fights, a crouching, bobbing and weaving Frazier constantly pressured Ali, getting hit regularly by Ali jabs and combinations, but relentlessly attacking and scoring repeatedly, especially to Ali's body. The fight was even in the early rounds, but Ali was taking more punishment than ever in his career. On several occasions in the early rounds he played to the crowd and shook his head \"no\" after he was hit. In the later rounds—in what was the first appearance of the \"rope-a-dope strategy\"—Ali leaned against the ropes and absorbed punishment from Frazier, hoping to tire him. In the 11th round, Frazier connected with a left hook that wobbled Ali, but because it appeared that Ali might be clowning as he staggered backwards across the ring, Frazier hesitated to press his advantage, fearing an Ali counter-attack. In the final round, Frazier knocked Ali down with a vicious left hook, which referee Arthur Mercante said was as hard as a man can be hit. Ali was back on his feet in three seconds. Nevertheless, Ali lost by unanimous decision, his first professional defeat.\nChamberlain challenge and Ellis fight.\nIn 1971, basketball star Wilt Chamberlain challenged Ali to a fight, and a bout was scheduled for July 26. Although the seven-foot-two-inch tall Chamberlain had formidable physical advantages over Ali— weighing 60pounds more and able to reach 14inches further —Ali was able to influence Chamberlain into calling off the bout by taunting him with calls of \"Timber!\" and \"The tree will fall\" during a shared interview. These statements of confidence unsettled his taller opponent, whom Los Angeles Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke had offered a record-setting contract, conditional on Chamberlain agreeing to abandon what Cooke termed \"this boxing foolishness,\" and he did exactly that. To replace Ali's opponent, promoter Bob Arum quickly booked a former sparring partner of Ali's, Jimmy Ellis, who was a childhood friend from Louisville, Kentucky, to fight him.\nFights against Quarry, Patterson, Foster and Norton.\nAfter the loss to Frazier, Ali fought Jerry Quarry, had a second bout with Floyd Patterson and faced Bob Foster in 1972, winning a total of six fights that year. In 1973, Ken Norton broke Ali's jaw while giving him the second loss of his career. After initially considering retirement, Ali won a controversial decision against Norton in their second bout. This led to a rematch with Joe Frazier at Madison Square Garden on January 28, 1974; Frazier had recently lost his title to George Foreman.\nSecond fight against Joe Frazier.\nAli was strong in the early rounds of the fight, and staggered Frazier in the second round. Referee Tony Perez mistakenly thought he heard the bell ending the round and stepped between the two fighters as Ali was pressing his attack, giving Frazier time to recover. However, Frazier came on in the middle rounds, snapping Ali's head in round seven and driving him to the ropes at the end of round eight. The last four rounds saw round-to-round shifts in momentum between the two fighters. Throughout most of the bout, however, Ali was able to circle away from Frazier's dangerous left hook and to tie Frazier up when he was cornered, the latter a tactic that Frazier's camp complained of bitterly. Judges awarded Ali a unanimous decision.\nWorld heavyweight champion (second reign).\n\"The Rumble in the Jungle\".\nThe defeat of Frazier set the stage for a title fight against heavyweight champion George Foreman in Kinshasa, Zaire, on October 30, 1974—a bout nicknamed \"The Rumble in the Jungle\". Foreman was considered one of the hardest punchers in heavyweight history. In assessing the fight, analysts pointed out that Joe Frazier and Ken Norton, who had given Ali four tough battles and won two of them, had both been devastated by Foreman in second-round knockouts. Ali was 32 years old, and had clearly lost speed and reflexes since his twenties. Contrary to his later persona, Foreman was at the time a brooding and intimidating presence. Almost no-one associated with the sport, not even Ali's long-time supporter Howard Cosell, gave the former champion a chance of winning.\nAs usual, Ali was confident and colorful before the fight. He told interviewer David Frost, \"If you think the world was surprised when Nixon resigned, wait 'til I whup Foreman's behind!\" He told the press, \"I've done something new for this fight. I done wrestled with an alligator, I done tussled with a whale; handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder in jail; only last week, I murdered a rock, injured a stone, hospitalized a brick; I'm so mean I make medicine sick.\" Ali was wildly popular in Zaire, with crowds chanting \"Ali, bomaye\" (\"Ali, kill him\") wherever he went.\nAli opened the fight moving and scoring with right crosses to Foreman's head. Then, beginning in the second round, and to the consternation of his corner, Ali retreated to the ropes and invited Foreman to hit him while covering up, clinching and counter-punching, all while verbally taunting Foreman. The move, which would later become known as the \"Rope-a-dope\", so violated conventional boxing wisdom—letting one of the hardest hitters in boxing strike at will—that at ringside writer George Plimpton thought the fight had to be fixed. Foreman, increasingly angered, threw punches that were deflected and did not land squarely. Midway through the fight, as Foreman began tiring, Ali countered more frequently and effectively with punches and flurries, which electrified the pro-Ali crowd. In the eighth round, Ali dropped an exhausted Foreman with a combination at center ring; Foreman failed to make the count. Against the odds, and amidst pandemonium in the ring, Ali had regained the title by knockout. Reflecting on the fight, George Foreman later said: \"I thought Ali was just one more knockout victim until, about the seventh round, I hit him hard to the jaw and he held me and whispered in my ear: 'That all you got, George?' I realized that this ain't what I thought it was.\"\nFights against Wepner, Lyle and Bugner.\nAli's next opponents included Chuck Wepner, Ron Lyle, and Joe Bugner. Wepner, a journeyman known as \"The Bayonne Bleeder\", stunned Ali with a \"knockdown\" in the ninth round; Ali would later say he tripped on Wepner's foot, or that Wepner had actually stepped on Ali's foot and he lost his balance. Wepner also admitted that is what happened in a later interview. It was a bout that would inspire Sylvester Stallone to create the acclaimed film, \"Rocky\".\nThird fight against Joe Frazier.\nAli then agreed to a third match with Joe Frazier in Manila. The bout, known as the \"Thrilla in Manila\", was held on October 1, 1975, in temperatures approaching . In the first rounds, Ali was aggressive, moving and exchanging blows with Frazier. However, Ali soon appeared to tire and adopted the \"rope-a-dope\" strategy, frequently resorting to clinches. During this part of the bout Ali did some effective counter-punching, but for the most part absorbed punishment from a relentlessly attacking Frazier. In the 12th round, Frazier began to tire, and Ali scored several sharp blows that closed Frazier's left eye and opened a cut over his right eye. With Frazier's vision now diminished, Ali dominated the 13th and 14th rounds, at times conducting what boxing historian Mike Silver called \"target practice\" on Frazier's head. The fight was stopped when Frazier's trainer, Eddie Futch, refused to allow Frazier to answer the bell for the 15th and final round, despite Frazier's protests. Frazier's eyes were both swollen shut. Ali, in his corner, winner by TKO, slumped on his stool, clearly spent.\nAn ailing Ali said afterwards that the fight \"was the closest thing to dying that I know\", and, when later asked if he had viewed the fight on videotape, reportedly said, \"Why would I want to go back and see Hell?\" After the fight he cited Frazier as \"the greatest fighter of all times next to me.\"\nLater career.\nFollowing the Manila bout, Ali fought Jean-Pierre Coopman, Jimmy Young, and Richard Dunn, winning the last by knockout.\nOn June 1, 1976, Ali removed his shirt and jacket and confronted professional wrestler Gorilla Monsoon in the ring after his match at a World Wide Wrestling Federation show in Philadelphia Arena. After dodging a few punches, Monsoon put Ali in an airplane spin and dumped him to the mat. Ali stumbled to the corner, where his associate Butch Lewis convinced him to walk away.\nOn June 26, 1976, Ali participated in an exhibition bout in Tokyo against Japanese professional wrestler and martial artist Antonio Inoki. Ali was only able to land two jabs while Inoki's kicks caused two blood clots and an infection that almost resulted in Ali's leg being amputated. The match was not scripted and ultimately declared a draw. After Ali's death, \"The New York Times\" declared it his least memorable fight. Most boxing commentators at the time viewed the fight negatively and hoped it would be forgotten as some considered it a \"15-round farce.\" Today it is considered by some to be one of Ali's most influential fights and CBS Sports said the attention the mixed-style bout received \"foretold the arrival of standardized MMA years later.\"\nAli fought Ken Norton for the third time in September 1976. The bout, which was held at Yankee Stadium, resulted in Ali winning a heavily contested decision that was loudly booed by the audience. Afterwards, he announced he was retiring from boxing to practice his faith, having converted to Sunni Islam after falling out with the Nation of Islam the previous year.\nAfter returning to box in two exhibition bouts in April 1977 against a then 18-year-old Michael Dokes and journeyman Jody Ballard, Ali successfully defended his title for the 9th time against Alfredo Evangelista in May. Ali fought again in September 1977, struggling in a 10th title defence against hard-hitting contender Earnie Shavers. Ali was hurt in the second round but ultimately won the fight by another unanimous decision. The bout caused his long-time doctor Ferdie Pacheco to quit after he was rebuffed for telling Ali he should retire. Pacheco was quoted as saying, \"the New York State Athletic Commission gave me a report that showed Ali's kidneys were falling apart. I wrote to Angelo Dundee, Ali's trainer, his wife and Ali himself. I got nothing back in response. That's when I decided enough is enough.\"\nIn February 1978, Ali faced Leon Spinks at the Hilton Hotel in Las Vegas. At the time, Spinks had only seven professional fights to his credit, and had recently fought a draw with journeyman Scott LeDoux. Ali sparred less than two dozen rounds in preparation for the fight, and was out of shape. He lost the title by split decision. Ali sought to regain his title however, and a rematch was scheduled for the fall of 1978.\nAli started training early and even travelled to Moscow, Russia to box in three exhibition fights in June of that year against Soviet Amateur champion Igor Vysotsky, Pyotar Zayev and Yevgeny Gorstkov. Embarrassed by the Spinks loss, Ali purportedly sparred over 200 rounds in his preparation for the rematch, seemingly determined to regain his title. The Spinks rematch took place in September 1978 at the Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. A then-record 63,350 people attended the bout and paid a total of $6 million in admission, making it the largest live gate in boxing history at that time. A fitter and sharper Ali, although noticeably slower than his prime years, danced around Spinks and scored from range for the majority of the bout, holding his much younger opponent every time he got in close. Ali won a well deserved unanimous decision, with referee Lucien Joubert scoring rounds 10–4, judge Ernie Cojoe 10–4, and judge Herman Preis 11–4. This made Ali the first heavyweight champion to win the lineal title three times.\nFollowing this win, on July 27, 1979, Ali announced his retirement from boxing. His retirement was short-lived, however; Ali announced his comeback to face Larry Holmes for the WBC belt in an attempt to win the heavyweight championship an unprecedented fourth time. The fight was largely motivated by Ali's need for money. Holmes' trainer Richie Giachetti said, \"Larry didn't want to fight Ali. He knew Ali had nothing left; he knew it would be a horror.\"\nIt was around this time that Ali started struggling with vocal stutters and trembling hands. The Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) ordered that he undergo a complete physical in Las Vegas before being allowed to fight again. Ali chose instead to check into the Mayo Clinic, who declared him fit to fight. Their opinion was accepted by the NAC on July 31, 1980, paving the way for Ali's return to the ring.\nThe fight took place on October 2, 1980, in Las Vegas Valley, with Holmes easily dominating Ali, who was weakened from thyroid medication he had taken to lose weight. Giachetti called the fight \"awful ... the worst sports event I ever had to cover.\" Actor Sylvester Stallone was at ringside and said that it was like watching an autopsy on a man who is still alive. In the eleventh round, Angelo Dundee told the referee to stop the fight, making it the only time that Ali ever lost by stoppage. After the fight, Holmes went back to his dressing room and cried. The Holmes fight is said to have contributed to Ali's Parkinson's syndrome. Despite pleas to definitively retire, Ali fought one last time on December 11, 1981, in Nassau, Bahamas, against Trevor Berbick, losing a ten-round decision.\nBy the end of his boxing career Ali had absorbed 200,000 hits.\nBoxing style.\nAli had a highly unorthodox boxing style for a heavyweight (210 pounds), epitomized by his catchphrase \"float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.\" Never an overpowering puncher, Ali relied early in his career on his incredible hand speed, superb reflexes and constant movement, dancing and circling opponents for most of the fight, holding his hands low and lashing out with a quick, cutting left jab that he threw from unpredictable angles. His footwork was so strong that it was extremely difficult for opponents to cut down the ring and corner Ali against the ropes. He was also able to quickly dodge punches with his speed, head movement, dancing and footwork.\nOne of Ali's greatest tricks was to make opponents overcommit by pulling straight backward from punches. Disciplined, world-class boxers chased Ali and threw themselves off balance attempting to hit him because he seemed to be an open target, only missing and leaving themselves exposed to Ali's counter punches, usually a chopping right. Slow motion replays show that this was precisely the way Sonny Liston was hit and apparently knocked out by Ali in their second fight. Ali often flaunted his movement by dancing the \"Ali Shuffle\", a sort of center-ring jig. Ali's early style was so unusual that he was initially discounted because he reminded boxing writers of a lightweight, and it was assumed he would be vulnerable to big hitters like Sonny Liston.\nJimmy Jacobs, who co-managed Mike Tyson, used a synchronizer to measure young Ali's punching speed versus Sugar Ray Robinson, a welter/middleweight who was considered pound-for-pound the best fighter in history. Ali was 25% faster than Robinson, even though Ali was 45–50pounds heavier. Ali's punches produced approximately 1,000pounds of force. \"No matter what his opponents heard about him, they didn't realize how fast he was until they got in the ring with him\", Jacobs said. The effect of Ali's punches was cumulative. Charlie Powell, who fought Ali early in Ali's career and was knocked out in the third round, said: \"When he first hit me I said to myself, 'I can take two of these to get one in myself.' But in a little while I found myself getting dizzier and dizzier every time he hit me. He throws punches so easily that you don't realize how much they hurt you until it's too late.\"\nCommenting on fighting the young Ali, George Chuvalo said: \"He was just so damn fast. When he was young, he moved his legs and hands at the same time. He threw his punches when he was in motion. He'd be out of punching range, and as he moved into range he'd already begun to throw the punch. So if you waited until he got into range to punch back, he beat you every time.\"\nFloyd Patterson said, \"It's very hard to hit a moving target, and (Ali) moved all the time, with such grace, three minutes of every round for fifteen rounds. He never stopped. It was extraordinary.\"\nDarrell Foster, who trained Will Smith for the movie \"Ali\", said: \"Ali's signature punches were the left jab and the overhand right. But there were at least six different ways Ali used to jab. One was a jab that Ali called the 'snake lick', like cobra striking that comes from the floor almost, really low down. Then there was Ali's rapid-fire jab—three to five jabs in succession rapidly fired at his opponents' eyes to create a blur in [the latter's] face so he wouldn't be able to see [Ali's] right hand coming behind it.\"\nFootwork.\nAn unconventional \"dancing\" style of footwork was popularized by Ali in the 1960s. He moved side to side, and forward and back, while bouncing on the balls of his feet and dancing around his opponents. This allowed him to quickly move to wherever he wanted in the ring. He also occasionally shuffled his feet back and forth quickly, confusing his opponents before landing a blow, a move called the Ali shuffle. His unconventional footwork was referred to as the \"dancing legs\" at the time.\nAli's footwork notably influenced martial artist and actor Bruce Lee, who studied Ali's footwork and incorporated it into his own Jeet Kune Do style of hybrid martial arts in the 1960s.\nTrash-talk.\nAli regularly taunted and baited his opponents—including Liston, Frazier, and Foreman—before the fight and often during the bout itself. He said Frazier was \"too dumb to be champion\", that he would whip Liston \"like his Daddy did\", that Terrell was an \"Uncle Tom\" for refusing to call Ali by his name and continuing to call him Cassius Clay, calling Patterson a \"rabbit\", and calling Foreman \"a mummy\". In speaking of how Ali stoked Liston's anger and overconfidence before their first fight, one writer commented that \"the most brilliant fight strategy in boxing history was devised by a teenager who had graduated 376 in a class of 391.\"\nAli typically portrayed himself as the \"people's champion\" and his opponent as a tool of the (white) establishment. During the early part of his career, he built a reputation for predicting rounds in which he would finish opponents, often vowing to crawl across the ring or to leave the country if he lost the bout. Ali adopted the latter practice from \"Gorgeous\" George Wagner, a professional wrestling champion who drew thousands of fans to his matches as \"the man you love to hate.\" When Ali was 19, Wagner, who was in town to wrestle Freddie Blassie and had crossed paths with Clay, told the boxer before a bout with Duke Sabedong in Las Vegas, \"A lot of people will pay to see someone shut your mouth. So keep on bragging, keep on sassing and always be outrageous.\"\nESPN columnist Ralph Wiley called Ali \"The King of Trash Talk\". In 2013, \"The Guardian\" said Ali exemplified boxing's \"golden age of trash-talking.\" Bleacher Report called Clay's description of Sonny Liston smelling like a bear and his vow to donate him to a zoo after he beat him the greatest trash-talk line in sports history.\nRope-a-dope.\nIn the opinion of many observers, Ali became a different fighter after the 3½-year layoff. Ferdie Pacheco, Ali's corner physician, noted that he had lost his ability to move and dance as before. This forced Ali to become more stationary and exchange punches more frequently, exposing him to more punishment while indirectly revealing his tremendous ability to take a punch. This physical change led in part to the \"rope-a-dope\" strategy, where Ali would lie back on the ropes, cover up to protect himself and conserve energy, and tempt opponents to punch themselves out. Ali often taunted opponents in the process and lashed back with sudden, unexpected combinations. The strategy was dramatically successful in the George Foreman fight, but less so in the first Joe Frazier bout when it was introduced.\nLater years.\nOf his later career, Arthur Mercante said: \"Ali knew all the tricks. He was the best fighter I ever saw in terms of clinching. Not only did he use it to rest, but he was big and strong and knew how to lean on opponents and push and shove and pull to tire them out. Ali was so smart. Most guys are just in there fighting, but Ali had a sense of everything that was happening, almost as though he was sitting at ringside analyzing the fight while he fought it.\"\nIn the mid-1970s, Ali took an interest in Asian martial arts, such as karate and taekwondo. The founder of American taekwondo, Jhoon Goo Rhee, coached Ali for several fights. A punching technique that Rhee taught him was the \"accupunch\", a technique that Rhee himself had originally learnt from Bruce Lee. The \"accupunch\" is a rapid fast punch that is very difficult to block, based on human reaction time—\"the idea is to finish the execution of the punch before the opponent can complete the brain-to-wrist communication.\" Ali was reportedly unable to block the punch when Rhee first demonstrated it to him. Ali later used the \"accupunch\" to knockout Richard Dunn in 1976.\nAli and his contemporaries.\nAli and Frazier.\nFriendship.\nIn an interview published in 2002, Joe Frazier recalled that he had first met Ali around 1968. At this time Ali was continuing his legal fight to get his boxing license back, and Frazier was the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world. Frazier stated that he had campaigned vigorously for Ali to get his license; this included going to Washington and meeting the president to lobby on Ali's behalf. Frazier also lent Ali some money at this time.\nAccording to Dave Wolf, former sports editor of \"Life\" and a member of Frazier's entourage, Frazier was keen for Ali's return to boxing, because he believed that beating Ali would win him unambiguous acknowledgement as the \"best.\" According to Wolf, Frazier was also kind to Ali during this time—agreeing to participate in staged confrontations, which enabled Ali to get publicity and earn money giving lectures. Wolf states that Frazier had deep respect for Ali's religious beliefs, and even participated in Muslim services at Ali's suggestion. Until Ali got \"nasty\" before their first fight, Frazier endorsed Ali's refusal to be drafted; Wolf recalls: \"I remember [Frazier] telling me, 'If Baptists weren't allowed to fight, I wouldn't fight either'.\"\nAli and Frazier knew they would become wealthy if Ali returned to the ring. Prior to their first fight, both had expressed a liking for each other. In 1970, Ali had stated: \"Me and Joe Frazier will be buddies. I just want it to go down in history that I didn't sell out or Uncle Tom when I got famous, and I don't think Joe Frazier's going to do that either. He ain't dumb.\"\nOpponents.\nAli and Frazier fought three fights in the span of five years; the first and third of these are widely regarded to be among the greatest of all boxing bouts, and the Ali-Frazier rivalry has been hailed as one of the greatest any sport has seen. Writing in \"Sports Illustrated\", William Nack commented: \nAccording to Ali, Frazier's style of boxing made him a tougher opponent for him than Liston or Foreman because he was vulnerable to Frazier's in-close left hook. Had he fought with Frazier before his three-and-half year break from boxing, when he was younger, \"I'd have danced for fifteen rounds, and Joe wouldn't have ever caught me.\"\nAfter Thrilla in Manila, Frazier called Ali \"a great champion\", and, referring to Ali, graciously stated that \"[m]y man fought a good fight\"; while Ali declared Frazier to be \"the greatest fighter of all time next to me.\"\nTrash-talk and altercations.\nIn the buildup to their bouts, Ali called Frazier \"dumb\" and an \"Uncle Tom\" before their first, \"ignorant\" before the second, and a \"gorilla\" before the third. Writers Dennis and Don Atyeo have noted that given Ali's warm words for Frazier in the past, his jibes about Frazier sounded hollow.\nOn January 23, 1974, five days before their second fight, Ali and Frazier had a public altercation captured on television. ABC Sports' Howard Cosell had arranged for the two to come to the studio to comment on their first fight. Things went smoothly until Frazier commented about Ali having to visit a hospital after the fight. Ali immediately responded by claiming he had gone to a hospital for ten minutes whereas Frazier had been hospitalized for three weeks after the fight, and concluded by calling Frazier \"ignorant.\" Frazier then snapped; removing his studio earplug, Frazier reached across to Ali, protesting the use of the word \"ignorant.\" Soon the two were wrestling on the floor, until they were separated by onlookers.\nAccording to veteran boxing commentator Ronnie Nathanielsz, during the buildup to Thrilla in Manilla, Ali once awakened Frazier in the middle of the night by constantly screaming. When Frazier appeared on the balcony of his hotel room, Ali pointed a toy gun at him and shouted: \"I am going to shoot you.\"\nImmediately after Thrilla in Manilla, Ali summoned Frazier's son Marvis to his dressing room and apologized for the things he had said about Frazier. When Marvis conveyed Ali's contrition to his father, Frazier commented that Ali should have communicated this to him directly. After returning to the United States, Ali called boxing promoter and manager Butch Lewis, and asked for Frazier's private number, saying he wanted to apologize to Frazier. However, when Lewis conveyed this request to Frazier, he was told not to share the phone number with Ali.\nFinale.\nIn 1988, Ali and Frazier joined George Foreman, Larry Holmes, and Ken Norton in Las Vegas for the making of the film \"Champions Forever\". At a local gym, Frazier came across Ali before a crowd of spectators, and said: \"Look at Ali. Look what's happened to him. All your talkin', man. I'm faster than you are now. You're damaged goods.\" Ali, already afflicted with Parkinson's, insisted that he remained faster than Frazier and pointing to a heavy bag suggested the two compete to see which of them could hit the bag the fastest. Frazier immediately took off his coat, moved to the bag and threw a dozen rapid punches at it accompanied by loud grunts. Without removing his coat, Ali strolled towards the bag, held the ready stance, mimicked one of Frazier's grunts without throwing a punch, and then addressed Frazier with the words \"Wanna see it again, Joe?\" Everyone laughed, except Frazier.\nLater that day, Frazier started walking towards Ali after having had too much to drink. Ali biographer Thomas Hauser, who was present, recalled that for the next 10 minutes Larry Holmes positioned himself between Ali and Frazier, preventing Frazier from reaching Ali. George Foreman then took over and acted as Ali's shield for the next 10 minutes. Throughout this incident, Ali remained oblivious to what was going on.\nIn his 1996 autobiography \"Smokin' Joe: The Autobiography of a Heavyweight Champion of the World\", in which he always refers to Ali as Cassius Clay, Frazier wrote: \nCommenting on Ali lighting the Olympic flame in 1996, Frazier stated that it would have been good if Ali had fallen into the cauldron after lighting the flame, and that he would have pushed Ali in himself if he had the chance to do so. In a press conference held on July 30, 1996, Frazier accused Ali of being a \"draft dodger\" and a racist, and claimed he would have been a better choice to light the Olympic flame. Also in 1996, Frazier claimed Ali was suffering from \"Joe Frazier-itis\" and \"left-hook-itis.\"\nIn a 1997 interview, Frazier expressed no regret for the words he had used for Ali at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. According to Frazier: \nIn a 2001 interview with \"The New York Times\", Ali again apologized to Frazier for calling him names which, Ali claimed, was done to promote their fights. Frazier initially accepted the apology saying it was time to put this issue behind them. However, subsequently Frazier commented that Ali should apologize directly to him instead of apologizing through a newspaper. Reacting to this, Ali stated: \"If you see Frazier, you tell him he's still a gorilla.\"\nIn his interview in Stephen Brunt's 2002 book \"Facing Ali\", Frazier, referring to how he had contributed to Ali's infirmity, claimed he was sure Ali thinks of him whenever he gets out of bed, and that whatever Ali was undergoing was the will of God.\nIn a 2008 interview, Frazier stated he had forgiven Ali, but was unable to comment on whether Ali's present condition was due to divine punishment, as he had earlier stated, since \"God works in a mysterious way.\"\nIn 2011, on the eve of the 40th anniversary of his first fight with Ali, and the year of his death, Frazier reiterated that he had forgiven Ali. Frazier's funeral service was attended by Ali who reportedly stood and clapped vigorously when the Rev. Jesse Jackson asked the mourners to stand and bring their hands together one last time for Frazier.\nExhibition boxing record.\n\"The following list does not include matches in which the opponent's name, location or exact date is unknown such as the one that took place in Genoa, Italy against Alonzo Johnson and Giorgio Bambini around 1971, his knockout victory over Alonzo Johnson in Doha, Qatar in 1971 (before The Fight of the Century), his two ten-round exhibitions against Roy \"Tiger\" Williams at Deer Lake in early 1975, his six-round exhibition on April 26, 1975 in Orlando, Florida, and the one that took place in Casablanca, Morocco around 1979.\" Exhibition contests do not count on a professional or amateur boxer's official record.\nTelevision viewership.\nMuhammad Ali's fights were some of the world's most-watched television broadcasts, setting television viewership records. Some of his most-watched fights drew an estimated 12 billion viewers worldwide between 1974 and 1980, and were the world's most-watched live television broadcasts at the time.\nPay-per-view bouts.\nThe earliest form of pay-per-view boxing telecasts was closed-circuit television, also known as theatre television, where fights were telecast live to a select number of venues, mostly theaters, where viewers paid for tickets to watch the fight live. The use of closed-circuit for boxing telecasts peaked in popularity with Ali in the 1960s and 1970s. Most of Ali's closed-circuit telecasts were handled by his promotion company Main Bout. The following table lists known ticket sales/buys for Ali fights at closed-circuit venues/theaters:\nProfessional boxing was introduced to pay-per-view home cable television with several Muhammad Ali fights, especially the \"Thrilla in Manila\" fight between Ali and Joe Frazier in 1975, which was transmitted through HBO. Ali had several fights broadcast on early pay-per-view home television:"

Nicknamed \"Mr Midnight\" he played for the Western Suburbs, Eastern Suburbs, Balmain, North Sydney and the Canberra Raiders in the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) competition and Hull F.C. in England. His sister Tarsha Gale was the first captain of NSW in Women's Rugby League.\nBackground.\nGale was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia and was the son of 1958 Commonwealth Games sprinter Terry Gale. His brother Brett played for Western Suburbs, Eastern Suburbs and North Sydney.\nPlaying career.\nGale made his first-grade debut for Western Suburbs against Eastern Suburbs in Round 1, 1983 at the Sydney Sports Ground, scoring a try in a 29–6 loss. Gale would go on to play 16 games for Wests as the club finished last on the table, claiming the wooden spoon.\nThe following season in 1984, Gale joined Eastern Suburbs and played a total of 19 games in his one and only season there as the club finished second-last on the table. Gale led the Roosters to the final of he National Panasonic Cup in 1984, a midweek competition played over four quarters. The matches were played at night which was at that stage, a novelty in the game.\nIn 1985, Gale joined Balmain and became a regular starter in the team, usually playing at halfback, as the club became a constant finals presence. During this time with Balmain he led them to three National Panasonic Cup finals, winning the National Panasonic Cup in 1985 and 1987. Gale was named, man of the match. For his performance in the 1985 final.\nIn 1988, Gale switched to the centres as Balmain reached the grand final against Canterbury-Bankstown that season. Gale played from the bench in the 1988 NSWRL grand final as Canterbury won 24–12. In 1989, Gale joined North Sydney, spending two unsuccessful seasons at the club, before switching to the Canberra Raiders.\nIn his first year at Canberra, Gale played 12 games as the club reached the 1991 NSWRL grand final against the Penrith Panthers. Gale played from the bench as Canberra went into half-time with a 12–6 lead. Late in the second half, and with the Raiders trailing and desperate to regain possession of the ball, Gale attempted a short goal-line drop-out. However, the ball was quickly pounced upon by Penrith forward Mark Geyer who passed the ball to his captain Royce Simmons, who scored the match-winning try.\nGale played on in 1992 but only managed a further eight appearances before leaving Canberra. Gale then returned to England to play for Hull F.C. in 1993, with whom he had played in the late 1980s during the off-season. Gale retired at the end of the 1993 season.\nDeath.\nAfter his playing career finished, Gale was later diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease. He died on 22 March 2004.\nHonours.\nAustralian Schoolboys 1982\nSydney Roosters/Eastern Suburbs\nBalmain Tigers\nCanberra Raiders\nIndividual"

        "title": "1888 Southern Rugby Union season",
        "text": "The 1888 Southern Rugby Football Union season was the 15th season of the Sydney Rugby Premiership. This was the sixth competition for the Gardiner Challenge Cup which was awarded to the winners of the premiership. The football season was from June till August 1888. The season culminated in the premiership, which was won by Sydney University who were crowned premiers who finished undefeated for the second year in a row. It was during 1888 that the first British Rugby team toured Australia and New Zealand playing two games against a NSW team. The intercolonial matches saw Queensland travel to Sydney to play two games against the home team.\nTeams.\nFor the second year in a row the Gardiner Challenge Cup was open for all rugby clubs to enter upon payment of an entry fee. When entries closed on 5 May, eight clubs had entered the competition. Each club entered had competed for the cup during the previous season. Three of last season's clubs were missing from the list of entries. Parramatta had disbanded during 1887 and withdrew from the premiership. Glebe decided not to enter the senior competition and concentrated their efforts on the lower ranked cups. Disappointingly, the Gordon Football Club did not enter into the competition and was disbanded. After winning the Cup during their first season of competition in 1886, Gordon suffered an unexplained drop in form in 1887. In April 1888 a meeting was held by the club with all intentions of entering the Cup. However, by the end of the month, it was reported that the club had disbanded and that its demise was \"confidently anticipated by all the knowing people.\"\nRule Changes.\nThe draw created by the union saw the premiership start later than was seen in previous seasons. With the international games against the British touring side scheduled for early June, the first round of cup games was not held until 16 June. A break was also taken for the intercolonial games against Queensland in mid-July and for the extra game against the British in early August. As a result of these interruptions, the Gardiner Challenge Cup saw only 7 rounds of games with no finals series held. The final game for the cup was held on 25 August.\nSeason summary.\nEventual premiers, Sydney University repeated their performance from the previous season. Seventeen wins, one draw, 200 points scored and only 12 points against over two seasons demonstrated their superiority. Their open and fast play closely resembled that of the British team, with long passing, good defence and follow-up. During dribbling rushes, University would see at least three players involved whereas opponents would be content to only watch their team's progress. For the representative matches, University had the fortune of having seven chosen. After a fourth match between NSW and the British fell through, University was quickly drafted in to play against the internationals. University demonstrated excellent skill against the visitors, leading 4 points to 2 at half time. The British team went on to win the match 8 points to 4.\nThe Arfoma Football Club demonstrated that untiring energy and consistent backing up could win a team matches. Despite having a light pack, Arfoma ran riot over many heavier teams. Their regular and effective passing was a feature of their game play. As a result, the team finished second to the undefeated University. Arfoma saw four members of the team chosen to represent their colony in the international matches.\nRosedale became one of the three leading clubs in rugby football in 1888. Much of the success of the team during the season was due to the speed of its players and their endurance. Their knowledge of the game assisted them in defeating more established older clubs. Rosedale suffered defeat only once during the season at the hands of eventual premiers University. Against Arfoma, the club drew without scoring. Rosedale saw two of their players selected to represent NSW against the British touring team.\nWallaroo boasted strong individual players but underperformed as a team. Individual performances rather than team play hindered the team from gaining success on the football field. Passing was only seen as a means to receive the ball, rather than give to another. However, the Wallaroo club had the fortune of enrolling the highest number of members. This saw the senior team fielding different players each week which was seen as a hindrance to further success.\nDespite being a successful part of the premiership and a winner of the Gardiner Cup, the Burwood Football Club found itself disbanding during the season. With the Chapman brothers retiring from football at the end of the previous season, the club struggled to display the same form as previously. A small number of loyal players continued with the club in an attempt to keep Burwood competitive. However, the team suffered a couple of large losses and ceased to exist after their third game.\nLower grades.\nPrior to the season beginning, at a meeting of the Southern Rugby Football Union, the matters of the various cups were considered. It was presented that the conditions attached to the cups precluded its acceptance. Therefore, there were questions whether the Union would accept the cups being offered by the various sponsors. It was decided that if the Junior Cup was not accepted, then no Union Cup would be held either. With Junior clubs now holding a representation within the Union, the Junior clubs decided that they would not accept a cup. The clubs were of the belief that they only needed club matches. Unfortunately, the crowd numbers and interest in the Junior matches were low, with some questioning the wisdom in refusing the competition.\nRepresentative Games.\nThe British Rugby Tour.\nThe 1888 season began with an influential series of games against a touring British Rugby team. A 21-man squad was organised by cricketers James Lillywhite, Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury to play a number of games in New Zealand and Australia, including a set of games played in Melbourne to the Australian rules. This tour was not sanctioned by the Rugby Football Union in England but was allowed to proceed. The British team wore jerseys of blue, red and white hoops with white shorts and dark socks.\nDue to the tour not being supported by the RFU, many players declined to be involved. The final team that departed Tilbury on the Thames contained a majority of English players with one Welshman, two Scots and an Irishman. The team was captained by Robert Seddon. Despite the RFU being staunch amateur with no interest in associating with professional football, players were paid to some extent with some players receiving over £200. English forward Jack Clowes of northern club Halifax, was reported to the RFU by a rival team chairman for receiving £15 for clothing. The RFU deemed him a professional and was banned from the sport. As he had already left on the tour, Clowes did not play any games while on tour in fear of other players receiving bans. On returning to England in November, the players were allowed to continue playing for their respective clubs after signing a declaration claiming they had not been paid. Clowes was also reinstated to avoid the impression that the \"gentleman amateurs\" were treated differently than the working class players. It is interesting to note that two thirds of the touring team were members of Northern England clubs that later defected from the RFU to form the professional union that later became known as Rugby League.\nThe chief games in Sydney were played against a NSW team at the Association Cricket Ground. The NSW team wore dark maroon jerseys with a blue shield on the chest, white shorts, maroon socks and a maroon cap. Players selected to represent the colony across the three games included Fred Hillyar (Arfoma), James O'Donnell (Arfoma), Arthur Hale (Arfoma), Tom Perry (Arfoma), Ewen Cameron (Balmain), Ronald Cameron (Balmain), Henry Braddon (Burwood), James Moulton, John Gee (Newtown), George Braund (Rosedale), James McMahon (Rosedale), Harold Baylis (University), Percy Colquhoun (University), Charles Tange (University), Herbert Lee (University), Jack Shaw (University), Leo Neill (University), William Bellbridge (University), Colin Caird (Wallaroo), Greg Wade (Wallaroo), Les Wade (Wallaroo) and J Rice (Wallaroo). Tange was chosen as captain of the team.\nThe first game on 2 June saw a crowd of 13,000 at the Association Cricket Ground. The British team had the measure of NSW with the final score being 18 points to 2. The follow-up match a week later saw a marked improvement from the NSW team with the scores at half time 6 points to 2 in favour of the home team. The visitors went on to win the game 18 points to 6 in front of a crowd that numbered over 5000. A final match was played 4 August in front of a healthy crowd of 5000. \nTragedy struck the visiting British team while on the tour. After playing a match in the Maitland region in mid-August, captain Seddon went for a scull on the Hunter River. Reports from the newspapers of the period indicate that the boat was overturned with Seddon swimming a few strokes before presumably suffering cramps and drowning. The tourists had little time to mourn as they were soon playing against a Brisbane team with cricketer Andrew Stoddart as captain.\nThe open and fast game that the British team displayed was in advance of the NSW type of play. It was reported in newspapers of the period that NSW were playing a two-year-old style of play compared to that of the British team. Such a demonstration was hoped to encourage improved play in the local clubs.\nIntercolonial matches.\nIn 1888 the intercolonial matches were held over two consecutive weeks in July. During these two weekends no matches were held for the Gardiner Challenge Cup. After playing the British team, NSW had developed their play to resemble something closer to that displayed by the British. Queensland put a lighter pack into the field than their opponents with their players displaying excellent support of the ball-carrier. In the first match, they scored 5 tries to NSW's 3. However they lost they game due to Baylis displaying outstanding accuracy with his kicking giving NSW the win 15 points to 13. The second match saw Queensland fail to display the same form as in the first, losing the match 9 points to 2."

        "title": "Dylan Cozens (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Dylan Cozens (born February 9, 2001), nicknamed the \"Workhorse from Whitehorse\", is a Canadian professional ice hockey centre for the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Sabres selected him seventh overall in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft. He is the first player from Yukon to be a first-round Western Hockey League (WHL) draft pick, a first-round NHL draft pick, and a member of the Canada men's national junior ice hockey team.\nBorn and raised in Whitehorse, Cozens began ice skating on a backyard rink when he was three years old. He often played against older opponents due to the limited pool of ice hockey players in his hometown, and after being injured by an adult player in a house league game, Cozens decided to move to British Columbia and play within his age group. After attending the Delta Hockey Academy, he was taken by the WHL's Lethbridge Hurricanes. After posting 22 goals and 53 points in his rookie junior ice hockey season, he received the Jim Piggott Memorial Trophy for the top first-year WHL player. He followed this performance with 84 points in 68 games the next season, and 85 points in 51 games before the COVID-19 pandemic ended the 2019–20 WHL season early. In his final WHL season, Cozens was a First Team All-Star and the runner-up for the Four Broncos Memorial Trophy.\nCozens joined the Sabres for the season, recording a point in his NHL debut. He battled several setbacks during his rookie season, including time in COVID-19 protocols and two upper-body injuries. The following season, Cozens, who had been playing on the wing as a rookie, moved back to his natural centre position to occupy a space abdicated by Sam Reinhart and Jack Eichel.\nEarly life.\nCozens was born on February 9, 2001, in Whitehorse, Yukon, to Mike Cozens and Sue Bogle. When he was three years old, Cozens' father built a backyard ice rink on which he learned how to skate and later play ice hockey. Because there were limited hockey players in Whitehorse, Cozens often played against older opponents; when he was 12, he broke his leg after being boarded by an adult man in a house league game. The incident convinced Cozens and his family to find teams within his age group outside of Whitehorse, and at the age of 14, Cozens moved to British Columbia to develop his skills at the Delta Hockey Academy. During Delta's 2015–16 season, Cozens scored 19 goals and 31 points in 25 regular season games, as well as five goals and six points in three postseason games. In January, Cozens participated in the 2016 John Reid Memorial Bantam Tournament with the Delta team. He led all tournament players with nine goals and 15 points in six games and was named to the Reid Division All-Star Team. Outside of Delta, Cozens also spent time with the Prince George Cariboo Cougars of the BC Hockey Major Midget League to build his strength and skills in the minor ice hockey circuit.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nThe Lethbridge Hurricanes of the Western Hockey League (WHL) selected Cozens in the first round, 19th overall, of the 2016 WHL Bantam Draft. It was the first time that a Yukon-born player had been selected in the first round of the WHL draft. He signed with the team that May, but because he was below the WHL's age minimum for the upcoming 2016–17 season, he played for the Yale Hockey Academy in Abbotsford, British Columbia, instead. He scored his first junior ice hockey goal in his WHL debut, a 5–3 loss to the Saskatoon Blades on November 13, 2016. After three games, he returned to Yale, where his 57 points (27 goals and 30 assists) in 30 games were tied for the CSSHL Midget Prep league lead. Cozens added another two goals and four points in three CSSHL playoff games, and once the Yale season ended, he rejoined Lethbridge for the WHL postseason. There, he had three goals and eight points in 12 playoff games before the Hurricanes were eliminated by the Regina Pats in the Eastern Conference Championship series.\nCozens returned to the Hurricanes for a full rookie season in 2017–18. After recording 13 points in as many games, including a five-game point streak and a three-point game against the Medicine Hat Tigers, he was named the WHL Rookie of the Month for October 2017. Cozens recorded his first WHL hat-trick on January 13, leading Lethbridge to a 5–2 victory over the Kootenay Ice. That performance, combined with three goals and six points in a two-game series against the Red Deer Rebels, earned Cozens WHL Player of the Week honours for the week ending January 14. In his first full season of junior ice hockey, Cozens posted 22 goals and 53 points in 57 regular-season games, and he received the Jim Piggott Memorial Trophy as the top rookie in the WHL. The Hurricanes faced the Rebels in the first round of 2018 WHL playoffs, and Cozens recorded his first postseason hat-trick in the second game of the series. Although the Hurricanes lost to the Swift Current Broncos in the WHL Eastern Conference Championship series, Cozens was named the WHL Rookie of the Month for April 2018 after recording seven goals and 13 points in 16 playoff games. Cozens was a finalist for the CHL Rookie of the Year award at the end of the season, a title that ultimately went to Alexis Lafrenière of the Rimouski Océanic.\nAt the start of the 2018–19 season, the NHL Central Scouting Bureau ranked Cozens, who had five goals and ten points in four games, an \"A\"-level prospect. His 14 points in 10 games led Lethbridge in scoring, and Cozens was one of three Lethbridge players to represent Team WHL at the 2018 CHL Canada/Russia Series. On November 23, Cozens recorded the first six-point game of his junior hockey career, scoring a hat-trick and recording an additional three assists in Lethbridge's 8–4 victory over the Brandon Wheat Kings. In January, Cozens was appointed the captain of Team Cherry at the 2019 CHL/NHL Top Prospects Game. Cozens finished his sophomore junior hockey season with 34 goals and 84 points in 68 regular-season games, and the NHL Central Scouting Bureau ranked him the No. 5 prospect among all North American skaters. He added an additional four goals and eight points in seven playoff games, but the Calgary Hitmen eliminated the Hurricanes in a winner-takes-all Game 7 of their opening-round playoff series. On June 21, the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League (NHL) selected Cozens seventh overall in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft. He was the first Yukon-born player ever taken in the first round of the NHL draft.\nCozens signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the Sabres on July 15, 2019. After attending Buffalo's training camp, Cozens returned to Lethbridge for the 2019–20 season. He was named the WHL Player of the Week for the second week of the season after posting six points and a +2 plus–minus rating in two games against the Rebels and the Edmonton Oil Kings. After recording 10 goals and 17 points through the first 13 games of the season, Cozens was named an alternate captain for Team WHL at the 2019 Canada/Russia Series. Cozens told reporters that he wanted to \"stay at an NHL level\" during the Hurricanes' season, and by December 11, he led the team with 42 points (19 goals and 23 assists) in 28 games. Halfway through the season, Cozens and Ty Prefontaine were named co-captains for the Hurricanes. By the time that concerns surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic forced the WHL to indefinitely postpone the 2019–20 season, Cozens led Lethbridge with 38 goals and 85 points in 51 games. Cozens was named to the WHL Eastern Conference First All-Star Team at the end of the season, and he was the runner-up for the Four Broncos Memorial Trophy, an award which went to Adam Beckman of the Spokane Chiefs. Cozens finished his WHL career with 95 goals and 223 points in 179 regular-season games, as well as 14 goals and 29 points in 35 postseason games.\nProfessional.\nCozens joined the Sabres for the season, making his NHL debut on January 14, 2021. Although Buffalo lost the game 6–4 to the Washington Capitals, Cozens recorded his first NHL point with an assist on Tobias Rieder's second-period goal. He scored his first goal on January 22, also against the Capitals. Although Cozens's goal tied the game 2–2, Washington ultimately won the game 4–3 in a shootout. In February, Cozens was one of several Buffalo skaters to miss time in COVID-19 protocols. Drafted as a centre, Cozens spent most of his rookie NHL season on the wing, only returning to the centre to fill in for an injured Jack Eichel in March. Cozens suffered additional setbacks with two separate upper body injuries: after missing four games at the beginning of March, he sat out an additional six games following a hard check from Philippe Myers of the Philadelphia Flyers on March 29. He had a strong April, assisting seven times in an eight-game span, and finished his rookie NHL season with four goals and 13 points in 41 games.\nWith Sam Reinhart's offseason departure and Eichel indefinitely sidelined due to a dispute with the Sabres' front office, an opportunity opened for Cozens to become a top-six centre for Buffalo during the season. He recorded the first multi-goal game of his career on November 12, scoring twice in a 3–2 win over the Edmonton Oilers. Cozens entered an extended slump in the stretch of the season, going without a goal between February 25 and April 5. He finally broke the drought after 17 games with a power play goal in Buffalo's 4–2 win against the Carolina Hurricanes. Cozens finished his first full NHL season with 13 goals and 38 points in 79 games. All but two of those goals came before the midseason NHL All-Star Game break. Cozens told reporters after the season that when his offensive production faltered, he switched his focus to improving his defense.\nOn February 7, 2023, the Sabres signed Cozens to a 7 year contract extension worth $49.7 million.\nInternational play.\nCozens made his first international tournament appearance at the 2017 World U-17 Hockey Challenge in British Columbia. He captured a silver medal with Canada Red, who lost the championship final 6–4 to the United States team, and put up seven points in the tournament, tying the team high. The following year, Cozens served as an alternate captain for the Canadian under-18 team at the 2018 Hlinka Gretzky Cup in Alberta. He scored a controversial goal in the semifinals, tying the Canada-USA game with 0.00 left on the clock to take the match into overtime, where Canada won 6–5 to eliminate Team USA. No video replay was available to replay the goal, and the victory stood. Cozens and Team Canada took gold in the tournament, with Cozens scoring four goals and nine points over the course of the Cup. Cozens finished his under-18 tournament career as an alternate captain for Team Canada at the 2019 IIHF World U18 Championships in Sweden. Canada failed to medal in the tournament, losing 5–2 to the United States in the third-place match. Cozens had four goals and nine points in seven games, tied for eighth among all tournament participants.\nFollowing his under-18 career, Cozens became the first Yukon player to represent the Canada men's national junior ice hockey team when he joined them for the 2020 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in the Czech Republic. He scored two goals and seven assists in seven World Junior games, winning a gold medal when Canada defeated Russia 4–3 in the championship match. Cozens was originally named an alternate captain for Team Canada at the 2021 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, but after captain Kirby Dach suffered a wrist injury, he and Bowen Byram were promoted to co-captains. He had eight goals and 16 assists, second among all participants, and was named to the tournament all-star team, while Canada took silver after a 2–0 shutout loss to the United States. Cozens played in his first senior World Championship tournament in 2022, where he finished third in overall scoring and received a silver medal.\nCareer statistics.\nCareer statistics derived from Elite Prospects."

Men's ice hockey tournaments have been staged at the Olympic Games since 1920 (it was introduced at the 1920 Summer Olympics, and was permanently added to the Winter Olympic Games in 1924). Czechoslovakia participated in sixteen tournaments, the first in 1920 and the last in 1992, only missing the 1932 Winter Olympics during the country's existence. The country split after that into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, with the Czech and Slovak national teams participating in every Olympics since then. Czechoslovakia won four silver and four bronze medals.\nThree players — Vlastimil Bubník, Josef Černý, and Jiří Holík — have played in four separate Olympics, while Bubník played in the most games, 30. Vladimír Zábrodský scored the most goals, 23, while Černý had the most assists, 17, and tied with Jozef Golonka for the most points, 29. Three players, Dominik Hašek, Václav Nedomanský, and Peter Šťastný, have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, while 24 players have been inducted into the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame, though Ján Starší was inducted as a builder."

It was the third wheelchair basketball world championship for women in the under-25 age category. Eight nations competed: Australia, Germany, Great Britain, Japan, Thailand, South Africa, Turkey and the United States. The event took the form of a round-robin tournament, with each team playing all the other teams once. The eight teams then went into quarter-finals, while the bottom two played each other for world ranking. The winners of the semi-finals faced each other in the final, while the losers played for bronze. The competition was won by the United States, with Australia taking silver and Great Britain claiming bronze.\nCompetition.\nThe 2019 Women's U25 Wheelchair Basketball World Championship was the third wheelchair basketball world championship for women in the under-25 age category. The event is held every four years; it was previously held in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada, in 2011, and in Beijing, China, in 2015. Thailand was chosen as the host in November 2018.\nEight nations competed: Australia, Germany, Great Britain, Japan, Thailand, South Africa, Turkey and the United States. The teams were divided into two pools. A draw ceremony was conducted in Bangkok on 1 April 2019, presided over by Ulf Mehrens, the President of the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation (IWBF), and Chutinant Bhirombhakdi, the President of the Paralympic Committee of Thailand. Great Britain, Japan, South Africa and Thailand were assigned to Pool A, and Australia, Germany, Turkey and the United States to Pool B. The competition format called for the teams to play each team in their pool. Based on the rankings, they then played a finals series. Because there was only eight teams, all advanced to the quarter-finals. The schedule was released in April 2019.\nVenue.\nThe event was held at the Suphanburi Indoor Stadium, a 4,000-seat stadium in the heart of Suphanburi.\nTeams.\nHead Coach: Stephen Charlton\nAssistant Coach: Sarah Graham\nAssistant/Technical: Dave Hegerty\nPhysiotherapist: Bonnie Kerr\nTeam Manager: Jane Kyle\nPhysiologist: Steph Shell\n\nHead Coach: Nthombizile Nthombeni\nAssistant Coach: James Mthethwa\nTeam Manager: Gerhard Smith\nSport Massage: Kate Douglas\nSecond Assistant Coach: Wiseman Dlamini\nChef De Mission: Charles Saunders\n\nTrainer: Dennis Nohl\nAssistant Trainer: Marina Mohnen\nPhysical Therapist: Franziska Vogel\nPhysiotherapist: Mathis Garvels\nTeam Doctor: Leutheuser\nTechnician: Marie Scheidemann\nHead Coach: Ali Arda Ozturk\nAssistant Coach: Tawatchai Jaisin\nTeam Manager: Wootisak Pinwiset\nAssistant Coach: Akapo Kunpradit\nAssistant Coach: Erdener Atalan\n\nHead Coach: Daniel Price\nAssistant Coach: Simon Fisher\nTeam Manager: Rosie Williams\nPhysiotherapist: Laura Heathcote\nPerformance Analyst: Nathan Payne\nDoctor: Andrew Hogg\nMechanic: Tanakom Sheepsomsong\nPerformance Director: Jayne Ellis\nHead Coach: Murat Saltan\nAssistant Coach: Abdullah Bayram\nTeam-Manager: Önder Yurdagül\nPhysiotherapist: Ayça Uyan\nMechanic: Servet Ergün\nCompanion: Seyhan Candan\n\nHead Coach: Sayaka Yamasaki\nAssistant Coach: Erika Yoshida\nTrainer: Jun Nomura\nTrainer: Takumi Saito\nTeam Staff: Miho Yoshikawa\nAnalyst: Keigo Hirata\nInterpreter: Nuriya Narita\nSecretary General: Yurie Miyamoto\nHead Coach: Lawerance \"Trooper\" Johnson\nAssistant Coach: Melanie Brionez\nAssistant Coach: Mieko Chambers\nTeam Manager: Trice Ham\nAthletic Trainer: Karla Francioni\nThe South African team was named on 8 May. The team included many players who were new to the sport, and some had never traveled on a plane before. The team officials were under no illusions about the difficulty of winning games, but saw the tournament as an opportunity to build their wheelchair basketball program, with an eye to qualifying for the 2024 Summer Paralympics in Paris. Similarly, the Australian U25 team, known as the Devils, was unashamedly a development team, with only one of its eleven players being a member of the senior team, the Gliders: Annabelle Lindsay, who had played in the 2018 Wheelchair Basketball World Championship in Hamburg in 2018. Most of the youthful side would be eligible to play in the next U25 championship, and three would be eligible to play in the next three. In contrast, Team Great Britain regarded itself as a serious contender, having won in Beijing in 2015, and the U24 European Wheelchair Basketball Championship in 2016 and 2018. The team included five members of the senior team: Joy Haizelden, Maddie Thompson, Kayla Bell, Siobhan Fitzpatrick and Charlotte Moore.\nPreliminary round.\nThe first day opened well for South Africa, which scored its first ever win in the competition, with a 16-35 win over the host nation. Team GB got off to a shaky start against Japan, but claimed a 47-30 win. The Devils performed well against Germany, with Lindsay racking up 27 points and 12 rebounds in a 55-37 win. On the final game of the day, the USA was too good for Turkey. On the second day, Japan notched up its first win, against South Africa; the USA had little trouble with Germany; the Devils held Turkey to a scoreless 11-0 first quarter before going on to post a second win; and Team GB coasted to an easy win against Thailand. On the third day, Germany defeated Turkey 46-24 to secure the third spot in Pool B, and Japan defeated Thailand to grab second place in Pool A. With another easy victory, this time 80-12 over South Africa, Team GB claimed the top spot in Pool A. The final game of the round was a fight for the top spot in Pool B between the Devils and the USA. The USA concentrated on shutting down Lindsay, who had been averaging 35 points per game. This time she scored only 10 points, but Teisha Shadwell also proved a threat, and ended the game with a double-double of 11 points and 12 rebounds. When the USA rotated its players, the Devils began to gain the upper hand, winning the third quarter by two points. In the end, the USA won 56-31, and, undefeated, secured the top place in Pool B.\nFinals.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nIn the quarter-finals, Japan staged a thrilling 18-8 final quarter fight back to defeat Germany 42-37. In a hard-fought match, Japan's pressure held Germany to a dismal 19 percent scoring efficiency, while Amane Yanagimoto racked up 21 points, and Kotone Usui had a double-double with 10 points and 17 rebounds. It was Japan's first ever quarter-final win, and ensured its highest ever ranking. For the Devils it would be their third semi-final appearance, with their place locked in with a 72-12 demolition of South Africa. Lindsay posted a double-double of 32 points and 24 rebounds, Georgia Bishop-Cash and Jess Cronje also posted double-doubles, and most of the rest of the team made the scoreboard. A brave Thailand held the USA to just 31 points at half time, its lowest half-time score of the tournament, but could not stop them, and the USA went into the semi-finals undaunted, posting a final score of 65-10. In the last quarter-final, Team GB defeated Turkey 70-15, with four players scoring in the double digits.\nIn the crossover games, Germany bounced back from its defeat by Japan to defeat Thailand 52-14, and Turkey celebrated its first ever win, a 48-25 victory over South Africa. In the first semi-final, the USA beat Japan 78-24. In the second, the Devils came up against the undefeated Team GB. Both sides subjected the other to intense defensive pressure, with Team GB forcing the Devils into a series of eight second violations. Maddie Thompson was pulled off after she racked up three personal fouls, and the British defence struggled with height of Lindsay and Shadwell. A three-point buzzer beater from Joy Haizelden left Team GB just two points down at half time, but the Devils pushed their lead out to four points by three quarter time. Team GB's press forced multiple turnovers, but the Devils' pressure caused Team GB to miss many shots, and they ended with an average shooting accuracy of just 22 percent. In the end, Team GB's undefeated run ended, and the Devils were into the final with a 42-36 win.\nSouth Africa won the 7th/8th place game against Thailand, Germany defeated Turkey in the 5th/6th place game, and Team GB rallied after its defeat by the Devils to claim the bronze medal with a win over Japan. In the anticlimactic final game, Lindsay lined up against five of her team mates from the University of Texas at Arlington Lady Movin' Mavs wheelchair basketball team: Nina Welfle, Rose Hollermann, Abby Dunkin, Josie Aslakson and Elizabeth Becker. The USA were too good, posting a 62-25 win. It was the USA's second win, and the Devil's third silver in a row.\nMVP and All Stars.\nThe 2019 Women’s U25 World Championship All-Star Five was announced at the closing banquet on the final night of the tournament at the Songphanburi Hotel, in Suphanburi. The All-Star Five is made up of the best 1 point player, 2 point player, 3 point player and 4 point player, plus the Most Valuable Player of the Tournament, as voted by their fellow competitors."

Graham made his first grade debut for Newtown in Round 1 1982 against Eastern Suburbs. Graham made 21 appearances for Newtown in his first year there and scored 7 tries but the club missed out on the finals finishing in 7th place.

Graham played in Newtown's final ever match in the NSWRL premiership, which was a 9-6 victory over the Canberra Raiders at Campbelltown Stadium. \nFollowing Newtown's exclusion from the premiership due to financial reasons, Graham returned to the country and was selected in 1984 to represent NSW Country against NSW City. Graham then headed to England and signed with Hunslet. Hunslet would go on to finish second last in the 1984/1985 season. Graham subsequently joined Oldham and played one season with them as they finished 9th on the table.

Under the coaching of Warren Ryan, Newtown went from a struggling team to title contenders and in 1981 finished second on the table. Newtown would go on to reach the 1981 NSWRL grand final against Parramatta. Pitman played at prop in the match as Newtown trailed Parramatta 7–6 at halftime before Parramatta came home in the second half to win 20-11 and claim their first premiership at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\nThe following season, Newtown were unable to replicate their form of 1981 and the club failed to reach the finals. In Round 5 of the 1982 season, Pitman was in the Newtown side which played in the lowest scoring game in NSWRL premiership history as they drew 0–0 with Canterbury at Henson Park. Pitman then departed Newtown at the end of 1982 and signed with Canterbury. Pitman played one season for Canterbury making 19 appearances and was part of the side which reached the 1983 preliminary final but lost to Parramatta 18–4. \nPitman then signed on with Lakes United in the Newcastle competition as captain-coach. Pitman later coached Griffith black and whites, now known as Griffith black and whites panthers.\nAfter leaving Canterbury in 1984 he captained/coached Kurri Kurri Bulldogs."

It was canceled after the first round due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The winner of the tournament was to have received the conference's automatic bid to the 2020 NCAA tournament. \nThe NCAA announced on March 11, 2020 that no fans would be able to attend the Men's and Women's 2020 NCAA tournaments, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of conference basketball tournaments followed suit by either canceling entirely, or playing as scheduled, but with no spectators in attendance. However, tournaments that were held in Las Vegas, including the Pac-12, were conducted with spectators in attendance on Wednesday, March 11. By the evening of March 11, the Pac-12 announced that the remaining games would be played only with \"essential staff, television network partners, credentialed media and limited family and friends.\" \nOn March 12, the Pac-12 canceled the tournament before any more games were to be played. On the afternoon of March 12, 2020, the NCAA announced that all remaining winter and spring championships for both men's and women's sports were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Because of its late West Coast tip-off, the first round match-up between Colorado and Washington State would prove to be the last completed game of the 2019-20 men's basketball season.\nSeeds.\nAll 12 Pac-12 schools are eligible to participate in the tournament. Teams will be seeded by conference record, with a tiebreaker system used to seed teams with identical conference records. As a result, the top four teams receive a bye to the quarterfinals of the tournament. \nTie-breaking procedures for determining all tournament seeding was:\n1. Results of head-to-head competition during the regular season.\n2. Each team's record (won-lost percentage) vs. the team occupying the highest position in the final regular standings, and then continuing down through the standings until one team gains an advantage. \nWhen arriving at another group of tied teams while comparing records, use each team's record (won-lost percentage) against the collective tied teams as a group (prior to that group's own tie-breaking procedure), rather than the performance against individual tied teams.\n3. Won-lost percentage against all Division I opponents.\n4. Coin toss conducted by the Commissioner or designee.\n1. Results (won-lost percentage) of collective head-to-head competition during the regular season among the tied teams.\n2. If more than two teams are still tied, each of the tied team's record (won-lost percentage) vs. the team occupying the highest position in the final regular season standings, and then continuing down through the standings, eliminating teams with inferior records, until one team gains an advantage.\nWhen arriving at another group of tied teams while comparing records, use each team's record (won-lost percentage) against the collective tied teams as a group (prior to that group's own tie-breaking procedure), rather than the performance against individual tied teams.\nAfter one team has an advantage and is seeded, all remaining teams in the multiple-team tie-breaker will repeat the multiple-team tie-breaking procedure.\nIf at any point the multiple-team tie is reduced to two teams, the two-team tie-breaking procedure will be applied.\n3.

        "title": "2020 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 2020 Indianapolis 500 (branded as the 104th Running of the Indianapolis 500 presented by Gainbridge for sponsorship reasons) was a 500-mile (800 km, 200-lap) automobile race held on Sunday, August 23, 2020, at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana. It was the premier event of the 2020 IndyCar Series. Takuma Sato won the race for Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing, his second Indianapolis 500 win, having previously won the 2017 race. It was also the second Indy 500 victory for car owners Bobby Rahal and David Letterman (2004, 2020). Rahal also won himself as a driver in 1986. It was also Honda's first Indy 500 win in the Reiwa era.\nFive-time IndyCar Series champion, and 2008 race winner Scott Dixon started in the middle of the front row, and dominated much of the race. Dixon led 111 laps, and led by as many as 7 seconds at one point during the first half. After the final round of pit stops, however, Takuma Sato chased down and passed Dixon for position on lap 172, which proved to be the winning move. After all other cars had cycled through their final pit stops, Sato elevated to the lead on lap 186. He was leading the race on lap 196 when a caution came out for a heavy crash by Spencer Pigot at the pit lane attenuator. With insufficient time to red flag the race for the cleanup, the final four laps were run under caution with Sato taking the checkered flag.\nOriginally scheduled for May 24, the race was postponed to August 23 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 running was the first time the race was not held on or around Memorial Day in late May. On August 4, it was announced that the race would be held without spectators.\nPractice was held on August 12–14 and time trials was held on August 15–16. Carb Day, the traditional final day of practice, was scheduled for August 21. A somewhat truncated schedule was utilized, with numerous ancillary events (Freedom 100, Pit Stop Challenge, concerts, and various festivities) cancelled. Marco Andretti, son of Michael Andretti and grandson of 1969 Indianapolis 500 winner Mario Andretti, won the pole position for Andretti Autosport. The achievement came 33 years after Mario won his third pole in 1987, and was the first Indy pole for the Andretti Autosport team since 2005. Andretti ended up finishing 13th, while the previous year's winner Simon Pagenaud of Team Penske finished 22nd.\nRace background.\nSponsorship.\nOn January 31, 2019, it was announced that the online financial services company Gainbridge would become the new presenting sponsor of the 500 under a four-year deal. This was the second year under the current deal.\nSafety changes.\nOn May 24, 2019, it was announced that IndyCar Series would introduce cockpit protection combining an aeroscreen and Halo from 2020 season onward. The cockpit protection was built by Red Bull Advanced Technologies. The combination of aeroscreen and halo is designed to improve safety standards by deflecting debris away from a driver's head and was originally developed for use in Formula One and IndyCar before its application was expanded to other open-wheel championships. During the first two races of the season, drivers experienced stifling heat in the cockpits, caused by the now limited airflow. A supplemental air duct was added to the aeroscreen beginning at Iowa to help cool the cockpits.\nOn July 17, 2020, the aeroscreen had its first major test at Iowa Speedway during the 2020 Iowa IndyCar 250s when during an aborted restart on lap 157, Ed Carpenter Racing's Rinus VeeKay appeared to slow behind eventual race winner Simon Pagenaud and move to the right, and behind the Dutch rookie, Andretti Harding Steinbrenner Racing's Colton Herta was caught in an accordion affect, launching the No. 88 Honda over the left-rear tire of VeeKay's No. 21 Chevy. Prior to getting significantly airborne, Herta's unimpeded nose—minus its wings—attempted to spear into the left side of VeeKay's cockpit, level with his helmet. With the aeroscreen acting as a vertical barrier, Herta's nose was forced upward, sliding skyward on the screen before hitting the top of the aeroscreen frame and flying over VeeKay's Dallara DW12 chassis. This saved VeeKay from apparent serious injury.\nOwnership changes.\nOn November 3, 2019, it was announced that Penske Entertainment Corp., a subsidiary of the Penske Corporation, owned by Roger Penske, had purchased the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the IndyCar Series, and IMS Productions. Penske, owner of Team Penske stepped down as full-time race strategist to focus on the new ownership roles. The sale was finalized in January 2020.\nShortly after acquiring the property, Penske swiftly began upgrading and beautifying several areas at the track, particularly in the spectator areas. A refurbishment of the restrooms and concession stands, as well as widening and re-paving/paving walkways behind the grandstands along with new fencing was completed in the spring. Thirty new video boards were installed along the mainstretch grandstands, along with a new video screen on the back of the Pagoda in the Pagoda Plaza. Other improvements included power washing, painting, improved internet service, general repairs, landscaping, hardscaping, and new lighting at the main gate. The victory lane podium was refurbished to include a new platform hoist to lift the winning car to the top.\nSchedule.\nOn March 12, 2020, the Speedway announced that the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic had not yet caused any changes to the proposed schedule. One day later on March 13, IndyCar officials announced that the first four races of the 2020 IndyCar season would be cancelled, along with the open test at Indianapolis scheduled for April 30.\nOn March 26, the series announced the rescheduling of the 2020 Indianapolis 500 to August 23. The GMR Grand Prix was rescheduled for and held July 4, as part of the NASCAR Brickyard 400 weekend, and a matinee doubleheader with the Xfinity Series Pennzoil 150. On May 31, it was announced that the 2020 Indy Lights season had been cancelled, and therefore the Freedom 100, traditionally run on Carb Day, would not be held.\nThe first two IndyCar events (Texas and GMR Grand Prix) were held mostly behind closed doors. Roger Penske stated on June 8 that \"we are going to run it [Indianapolis 500] with fans\", and that the race could be delayed further if they are unable to admit spectators. On June 26, it was initially announced that spectators would be admitted for the Indianapolis 500 at half capacity, including restricting grandstands, and not holding the Snake Pit concert party.\nOn July 20, Penske Entertainment CEO Mark Miles stated that the IndyCar Series was continuing to work with local health officials, and that \"unless the COVID-19 world crashes in on us and healthcare metrics really turn south meaningfully, I'm quite confident we'll be able to do the race.\" On July 21, the Speedway announced the attendance cap for the race would be reduced to a quarter of its total capacity, and that attendees would be required to wear face coverings. On August 4, citing COVID-19 case trends in Marion County (which contains Indianapolis and IMS), it was announced that the race would be held without spectators.\nOn August 7, the Last Row Shootout, previously scheduled to take place directly before the Fast Nine Shootout on August 16, was cancelled since the final entry list did not contain more than 33 entries.\nFestivities.\nOn March 18, it was announced that the 500 Festival Mini-Marathon scheduled for May 2 would not be held. On July 22, Legends Day and the 500 Festival Parade downtown were cancelled. The annual Last Row Party was cancelled, as well as the annual Old Timers Banquet and Hall of Fame induction ceremony. The 2020 Hall of Fame class (Janet Guthrie and Dale Earnhardt Sr.) will be inducted alongside the 2021 class.\nOn August 4, it was announced that the Pit Stop Challenge, traditionally held on Carb Day, would be cancelled. On August 7, the traditional balloon release was removed from the pre-race festivities.\nDr. Elvis Francois and Dr. William Robinson, known as the \"Singing Surgeons\", will perform \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". Francois and Robinson previously performed \"God Bless America\" during the NBC Special \"Back Home Again\" on May 24. Jim Cornelison returned for his fourth year to perform \"Back Home Again in Indiana\"\nStart time.\nCiting summer heat, the Speedway announced the start time would be moved back one hour and forty-five minutes from 12:45 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. (EDT), the latest scheduled start time of the Indianapolis 500. For many years after World War II, the race had traditionally been scheduled to start at 11 a.m. local time, which was typically equivalent to 12 p.m. EDT. After exceptions in 1970 (12 p.m. local time), and from 2005 to 2010 (1 p.m.), the race went back to a 12 p.m. EDT (approximate) start time since 2011, but switched to 12:45 p.m. in 2019 under NBC's television contract.\nWith the final round coverage of The Open Championship at Royal Troon, a women's golf major (the men's had been cancelled that year), scheduled for August 23 to air on NBC, the later start time allows The Open to finish without interfering with television coverage of the Indy 500.\nOn July 8, NASCAR announced the remainder of its schedule through the end of August, which included a 200-mile Xfinity Series and 500-kilometer Cup Series doubleheader at Dover the same day as the Indy 500. The races were part of a twin race weekend for both series where both series raced the respective distances (the Saturday races are the May races postponed by the pandemic; the Cup Series races were trimmed by 89 laps and became 500-kilometer races). The races aired in part against the Indy 500 on NBCSN.\nOriginal schedule.\nThe original schedule for the 2020 Indianapolis 500 was released in early 2020.\nEntry list.\nThe official entry list was published by IndyCar on August 10 with a total of 33 car/driver combinations. All entries used the chassis, with Firestone tires. A total of eight former Indy 500 winners were included. It was the most former winners in the field since there were ten in 1992.\nThree-time Indy 500 winner Hélio Castroneves (2001, 2002, 2009) made his 20th consecutive start. He became the 9th driver all time to achieve 20 career starts. He moved into a tie for third all time for most consecutive starts.\nAs the defending Indy Lights champion, Oliver Askew was guaranteed an entry as part of the Road to Indy scholarship program. He signed with Arrow McLaren SP. Two-time Formula One World Champion Fernando Alonso confirmed that he was returning for his third Indianapolis 500 attempt, in a third Arrow McLaren SP entry.\nByrd Racing announced they would not field a dedicated entry due to financial issues, but later announced a deal that \"had come together quickly\" with Dale Coyne Racing, Indy Lights team Belardi Auto Racing and NASCAR and sports car team Rick Ware Racing to field a car for James Davison.\nDragonSpeed became the 33rd entry for the race after finding the necessary funding the weekend before opening practice.\nFor the first time since 1999, there was not a female driver in the starting lineup. The 2020 race also marked the first time since 1991 that not a single female driver was entered.\nTesting and Rookie Orientation.\nAeroscreen test – October 2019.\nThe series conducted an official evaluation test on October 2, 2019, at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Two teams tested the new aeroscreen developed by Red Bull Advanced Technologies. The cockpit safety device is scheduled to be implemented for the 2020 season. Scott Dixon and Will Power collectively drove more than 600 miles' (1,000 km) worth of laps, and the test yielded mostly positive results.\nOval rookie test – February 14.\nFour IndyCar rookies took part in an oval acclimation test at Texas Motor Speedway on February 14. Oliver Askew, Álex Palou, Rinus VeeKay, and Scott McLaughlin took part in the test, which was conducted by IndyCar officials. The test provided the drivers with high-speed oval experience prior to the start of the Rookie Orientation Program. Veterans Josef Newgarden and Ed Carpenter also took laps, doing further evaluations of the new aeroscreens. Cold temperatures delayed the start of the test, but a total of five hours of track time was available. No incidents were reported.\nOpen test.\nA full field open test was scheduled for Thursday, April 30. However, the test was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. When the Indianapolis 500 was later rescheduled for August 23, no testing time (open test or private testing) was made available before practice was to begin on August 12. The original date of the race would have made it the first oval track event of the 2020 season. With the rescheduled date, the race was now the fourth of six oval races, as well as the second superspeedway race, Texas being the first. This was the first time since 2010 (Kansas) that there was a superspeedway race held prior to the Indianapolis 500.\nDuring the week leading up to the originally scheduled race day, Simon Pagenaud and Alexander Rossi took some demonstration laps for the NBC Sports special \"Back Home Again\" which aired on May 24. It marked the first laps both drivers had taken with the new aeroscreens; however, none of the laps were driven at racing speed.\nRace summary.\nFirst half.\nRace day saw high temperatures of and partly cloudy skies throughout.\nThe race began with Scott Dixon immediately pulling into the lead, with pole sitter Marco Andretti being shuffled to third by the end of the lap. Further back in the field, Ed Carpenter impacted the wall in the south short chute, requiring Carpenter to repair damage to the suspension. Carpenter alleged he was forced into the wall by Zach Veach, but IndyCar officials took no action. The first caution of the day came only 6 laps into the race, when James Davison suffered a brake issue that caused the entire right front wheel assembly to catch fire and spray debris along the backstretch. Davison brought the flaming car to a halt just before pit entrance and exited the car safely. Davison later indicated that the brake master cylinder locked on the car, causing the brakes to be stuck on and generate large amounts of heat, ultimately leading to the magnesium wheels catching fire. Racing resumed at lap 12, with Dixon and Takuma Sato, while Ryan Hunter-Reay, James Hinchcliffe, and Alexander Rossi completed the top 5. The second caution of the race came only a short time later at lap 25, when Marcus Ericsson lost control of his car in turn one and crashed into the outside wall then slid until part way through turn 2. Ericsson was uninjured, but was out of the race. During the caution, nearly all of the front running cars pitted, with Dixon, Sato, and Andretti emerging first. Cars that had pitted during the first caution cycled to the front of the field, meaning that rookie Oliver Askew now led the race ahead of defending winner Simon Pagenaud and 2018 winner Will Power.\nRacing resumed again at lap 31, with Pagenaud taking the lead from Askew entering turn 1. Behind, those that pitted began to work their way up through the field, with Dixon moving up to 6th and Alexander Rossi moving up several spots to 7th. At lap 46, those who had stayed out at the previous caution began to pit, and Dixon reclaimed the lead with Rossi second. Pit stops on the majority strategy began at roughly lap 60, with Dixon retaining his lead. Rossi lost several seconds after a late call to pit lane resulted in him missing pit lane altogether and being forced to take another lap. Rinus VeeKay, who had been running in the top 5, slid through his pit stall and hit one of his crew members, resulting in a stop and hold penalty. Sage Karam also suffered issues after coming into the pits too fast and sliding completely past his pit box.\nBy lap 75, Dixon had pulled a gap of over 7 seconds to Askew who ran second and over 10 seconds to Rossi in third. However, the lead was erased by the race's third caution at lap 84, when Dalton Kellett slid wide into the outside wall in turn 3 after a failed attempt to pass Ben Hanley. Most of the field pitted during this sequence, though the off-strategy runners came in later and emerged at the end of the field. Following stops, the running order ran Dixon, Sato, Rossi, Patricio O'Ward, and Josef Newgarden. The restart from the third caution came at lap 91, but another incident occurred before the cars reached the start/finish line. Conor Daly lost control of his car in turn 4 and spun in front of traffic. Behind him, Oliver Askew spun in avoidance and crashed heavily into the inside wall before ricocheting back towards the track and impacting Daly's car. Askew suffered a concussion from the impact, but was released from the infield care center with no symptoms or diagnosis, initially thought to have just been winded. Askew would later be forced to miss the Harvest Grand Prix later in the year after complaining of balance and coordination issues and being declared medically unfit by IndyCar's medical team.\nSecond half.\nRacing resumed at lap 100 with Alexander Rossi moving past Takuma Sato to take second place behind Scott Dixon. Dixon and Rossi began exchanging the lead back and forth in an effort to keep momentum up and break away from Sato and Patricio O'Ward behind them, but were only marginally successful in doing so. At lap 121, the fifth caution of the day interrupted their battle, as Álex Palou lost control of his car in turn 1 and crashed into the outside wall before spinning and skidding to a stop at the entrance of turn 2. During the caution most of the field pitted, with Dixon emerging ahead again. Behind, Rossi was released into the path of Sato, leading to minor contact and Sato having to take evasive action to avoid crashing heavily into Rossi's car. Rossi was assessed a penalty for an unsafe release and was moved to the end of the field for the following restart. Felix Rosenqvist inherited the lead by being the only driver not to pit, while Dixon, O'Ward, Sato, and Graham Rahal sat behind him.\nGreen flag conditions returned at lap 130. Rosenqvist lead for a few laps before teammate Dixon passed him at lap 132. Behind him, Sato and Rahal both moved past O'Ward, giving them second and third positions once Rosenqvist finally pitted. At lap 144, the sixth caution of the day came, this time for Rossi, who lost control of his car in turn 2 and impacted the outside wall. Racing resumed at lap 154 with Dixon still ahead of Sato. On lap 157, Sato passed Dixon to take the lead for the first time of the race, just before final pit stops.\nFinish.\nThe final round of pit stops came around lap 168. After the pit stops Dixon emerged ahead of Sato once again, with Rahal running in third. Zach Veach and Max Chilton remained on track in front of them for several laps hoping for a caution to extend their fuel, but eventually peeled off and pitted. On lap 172, Sato passed Dixon again, effectively making him the leader. This became the actual lead at lap 186 after Veach's pit stop. With 19 laps to go, Sato came under increasing pressure from Dixon after Dixon's team indicated that fuel millage concerns were no longer an issue. Despite several attempts, Dixon was unable to get around Sato before they reached lap traffic, which allowed Sato to gap Dixon.\nAs the leaders were going through turn three on lap 196, the seventh and final caution of the race came. Spencer Pigot lost control exiting turn 4, spun, and made heavy contact with the pit lane attenuator, causing severe damage to both the car and the wall separating pit lane from the front straightaway. A team of safety workers and medical staff extracted Pigot from the heavily damaged vehicle and laid him down on his back on front straightway during the closing laps for a cursory medical examination before ordering him ambulanced to Methodist Hospital. He was discharged a few hours later without serious injury.\nWith now less than three laps remaining, significant damage to the pit wall (which would require a lengthy repair), and with safety crews tending to the scene, the officials decided there was insufficient time to red flag the race. In some previous years, a late-race red flag had been utilized to provide an opportunity for a green flag finish. The race ended under caution, with Takuma Sato taking his second victory ahead of Scott Dixon and Graham Rahal. Santino Ferrucci and Josef Newgarden progressed from deep on the starting grid to round out the top 5 positions. Patricio O'Ward finished in sixth position, securing Rookie of the Year honors in the process.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\n Points include qualification points from time trials, 1 point for leading a lap, and 2 points for most laps led.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nThe race was televised on NBC in the United States; also, for the first time since 2016, the race was not blacked out in the Indianapolis area, airing live on WTHR (channel 13), as ticket sales ended four weeks prior to the race, and under regulations of the Speedway and Marion County Public Health Department's orders regarding capacity limits for events, announced two weeks before tickets were revoked under Marion County orders. On the original date of the race, NBC aired an encore of the 2019 edition of the race, \"Back Home Again\", with Mike Tirico joined by Simon Pagenaud and Alexander Rossi (645,000 viewers)\nOn August 23, the live coverage on NBC was scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. eastern, following live coverage of The AIG Open Championship. The start of the race was moved from 12:45 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. During coverage of practice, time trials, and race day, driver analyst Paul Tracy moved out of the Pagoda and reported from the Turn Two Suites. This mimicked the position Bobby Unser utilized from 1993 to 1997. Tracy's position offered unique perspective, as well as promoted social distancing among the reporters.\nAbsent from the crew was Dale Earnhardt Jr., who drove the pace car and served as analyst in 2019. Earnhardt was instead covering the NASCAR Drydene Twin 500km that aired on NBCSN. Also absent was Robin Miller, who relinquished on-air duties due to battling bone cancer. Miller did contribute to the broadcasts, providing narration to pre-taped features during practice and time trials.\nThe Nielsen rating of 2.26 (3.699 million viewers) was an all-time low for the event.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network. The chief announcer or \"Voice of the 500\" for the fifth consecutive year was Mark Jaynes with Davey Hamilton as driver analyst."

        "text": "The Australian Men's National Ice Hockey Championship is an annual elimination tournament for Ice Hockey Australia between each Australian state and territory. It consists of a round robin format tournament, where each state plays another 1 time to determine placement for the sudden death playoff format. The sudden death playoff format consists of 2 semi-final rounds followed by a gold medal game and a bronze medal game.\nTo be eligible for the Australian National Men's Ice Hockey Championship players must be senior men aged 17 years and older with the condition that players of the Australian Ice Hockey League that are 24 years and older must have played less than 6 games to remain eligible.\nHistory.\nThe origin of this National championship shares a similar origin of a previous tournament with an award bearing the Brown surname but in this case was the father of Jim Brown, the namesake of the Jim Brown Shield that is awarded to the current winners of the Australian Men's National Ice Hockey Championship. The Jim Brown Shield is the third trophy to bear the Brown surname.\nPrevious Awards With the Brown Surname.\nF.C. Brown Trophy.\nThe F.C. Brown Trophy was first presented in 1928 as an inter-state championship trophy for relay speed skating and presented by Francis Cowan \"Buster\" Brown for a competition between the Goodall Cup teams from New South Wales and Victoria. The competition consisted of each competitor skating 2 laps of the rink.\nIn July 1935, the Victorian Ice Hockey Association held a meeting to discuss a suggestion by the New South Wales Ice Hockey Association to hold the competition during the national carnival in Sydney Australia, Sydney in a format that consisted of a series of match races instead of the usual relay style format. The VIHA declined the suggestion due to it being thought to be too much for the state representatives to participate in the National half mile, and quarter mile races as well as now competing in match races on the same evening.\nThe F.C. Brown Trophy was contested on 20 July 1937 as part of the interstate ice hockey tournament between New South Wales and Victoria for the Goodall Cup at the Sydney Glaciarium.\nF.C. Brown Trophy Champions\nF.C. Brown Memorial Shield.\nUntil 1938, the only annual interstate ice hockey championship in Australia was for the most elite ice hockey players in the country consisting of a state team for New South Wales and Victoria competing for the Goodall Cup. In 1938, by request from both New South Wales and Victoria, a second annual interstate tournament was created for the fringe players that did not make selection for the Goodall Cup interstate tournament. This tournament was referred to as the F.C. Brown series or Return Interstate Ice Hockey Series and would be played in the state where the Goodall Cup tournament was not played.\nThe trophy awarded to the winner of this tournament was named the F.C. Brown Memorial Shield which was in memory of Francis Cowan Brown who had died two years before in 1936. The trophy itself was originally donated by James 'Jimmy' Brown, the son of Francis Cowan Brown.\nIn 1951 the decision was made to discontinue the F.C. Brown series due to lack of ice time availability and financial issues. The current whereabouts of the F.C. Memorial Shield remains unknown.\nF.C. Brown Memorial Shield Champions\nOrigin.\nIn 1964 the president of the New South Wales Ice Hockey Association, Harry Curtis, donated the Jim Brown Shield for the interstate junior ice hockey tournament aged 18 years and under in the name of James Archibald \"Jimmy\" Brown who had died five years before.\nCurrently the trophy is referred to as the Jim Brown Shield and as of the 2015 season it is competed for by men aged 17 years and older with the exception that AIHL players aged 24 years and older must have played less than 6 AIHL games."

Ding and Liang were on different teams for the event, due to China having two sides as hosts. The \"China B\" team of Liang and Zhou Yuelong reached the final of the event, where they met the Scotland team of John Higgins and Stephen Maguire. Higgins and Maguire won the event winning the final 4–0. This was the first win in the World Cup for Scotland since the 1996 World Cup.

The tournament consisted of 24 national teams, with two players competing for each side. The World cup was split into a group stage and a knockout stage. The 24 teams were split into four groups of six teams. The group stages consisted of matches played as best-of-five-frames with four frames of singles, and a frame of doubles. The top two teams from each group advanced to the Knockout Stages, the order being determined by total frames won. If there is a tie in either of the first two places the following rules determine the positions:\nDuring the knockout stage, matches were played as best-of-seven-frames. The knockout matches were scheduled as four singles matches and two doubles matches with the final frame being a singles match, with participants nominated by each team.\nPrize fund.\nThe total prize fund for the event totalled $800,000, with the winning team receiving $200,000.\nParticipants.\nThe tournament was made up of 24 pairs of players representing individual nations. China, who had won the event in both the last three events, in 2017 and 2015 and 2011 were allocated two places due to being hosts. Below is the list of teams and players participating.\nSummary.\nGroup stage.\nThe group stages for the event was played from 24 to 28 June 2019. Group A featured defending champions Ding Junhui and Yan Bingtao representing China A, who won four of their five matches.

The final was played between Maguire and Higgins representing Scotland and Zhou Yuelong and Liang Wenbo representing China B and was refereed by Jan Scheers.

They play their home games at their Brooklyn Campus in the Steinberg Wellness Center and Barclays Center, formerly known as the Wellness, Recreation &amp; Athletics Center, and are members of the Northeast Conference. Their current head coach is Rod Strickland who was hired in June 2022.\nThe LIU Sharks are the result of the July 1, 2019 unification of the athletic departments which had previously represented two separate campuses of LIU, the Division I LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds and the Division II LIU Post Pioneers.\nHistory.\nFollowing Long Island University's founding in 1927, it soon entered intercollegiate athletic competition. Initially, its sports teams wore blue uniforms and became known as the Blue Devils. In 1935, a \"Brooklyn Eagle\" reporter saw the basketball team in its new black uniforms and stated that the team looked like blackbirds, and a new nickname was born.\nLIU was a national basketball powerhouse in the 1930s and 1940s under Clair Bee, who compiled the highest winning percentage in major college basketball history, and the 1935–36 team was retroactively recognized as the pre-NCAA tournament national champion by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. \nAfter several players were implicated in the point-shaving scandal of 1951, LIU shuttered its entire athletic program. It returned to the College Division (now Division II) in 1957 as the LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds.\nBlackbirds.\nThe LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds men's basketball team represented the Brooklyn campus LIU in Division II from 1957. The Blackbirds were members of the Northeast Conference. The team first returned to the University Division (the predecessor to Division I) in the late 1960s. They finally returned to Division I in the 1980s. At the same time as the Blackbirds returned, LIU's C.W. Post College Pioneers began competing, in the College Division with the school being renamed LIU Post in 2012.\nTheir final head coach was Derek Kellogg, who was hired after his firing from Massachusetts in 2017, with the 2017–18 season was his first as head coach. On March 12, 2013, the team achieved what was the greatest run in Northeast Conference history with a third straight NCAA Tournament bid.\nIn October 2018, LIU announced that it would merge its two existing athletic programs—the LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds and LIU Post Pioneers, the latter an NCAA Division II member—effective with the 2019–20 school year. The merged athletic program now competes as the LIU Sharks, with the new colors of blue and gold, with Kellogg becoming the Sharks' first head men's basketball coach.\nBlackbirds Postseason.\nNCAA Division I Tournament results.\nThe Blackbirds appeared in the NCAA Division I tournament seven times. Their combined record was 0–7. \nNCAA Division II tournament results.\nThe Blackbirds appeared in the NCAA Division II tournament three times. Their combined record was 6–3.\nNIT results.\nThe Blackbirds appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) ten times. Their combined record was 7–8 and they were NIT champions in 1939 and 1941.\nRivalry.\nFor 44 years, beginning in the 1975–1976 season, an annual \"Battle of Brooklyn\" has been a tradition for LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds and St. Francis Brooklyn Terriers men's basketball teams. Each season, a game (the schools usually play each other twice) is dedicated in tribute William Lai and Daniel Lynch, former athletic directors at Long Island University and St. Francis College, respectively. The \"Battle of Brooklyn\" has been a tradition between the basketball programs for 40 years. Each year the most valuable player of the game is given the Lai-Lynch Trophy in memory of the two ADs. Long Island now has a \"Battle\" record of 23–17 against St. Francis."

He played for Balmain, primarily as a , and earned selection for the Australian national team. He later became a well known referee in the New South Wales Rugby Football League (NSWRFL) competition.\nPlaying career.\nBishop played for Gladesville in 1919 before moving into Balmain's reserve team. He made his first grade debut for Balmain against rivals Glebe in Round 16, 1923 at Birchgrove Oval. Bishop then departed Balmain and signed with Parkes in the country competition. The following season, Balmain won the premiership after defeating South Sydney 3–0 in the final.\nAfter three seasons with Parkes, Bishop returned to Balmain. Bishop finished as Balmain's top tryscorer on his first season back with the club.\nIn the same year, Bishop earned his first representative honour as he was selected to play for Metropolis and New South Wales. In 1929, Bishop was selected to play for Australia on the Kangaroo Tour and participated in test matches against Great Britain.\nOver the coming years, Bishop would be continue to be selected at representative level but premiership success would elude him with Balmain only reaching the finals once in his entire playing career. Towards the end of his career in 1933, Bishop was selected for a second Kangaroo Tour but was ruled out due to injury.\nRefereeing career.\nIn 1937, Bishop was graded as a referee. In 1939, Bishop was the referee as his old club Balmain defeated South Sydney in the grand final. Bishop then went on the referee in two other grand finals featuring Balmain in 1946 and 1948. The following year, Bishop was the referee in the 1949 NSWRFL grand final between St George and South Sydney.\nWhen Western Suburbs met South Sydney in the 1952 NSWRFL decider, Bishop was selected as the referee in what would turn out to be his last match as an official. The match was remembered for much controversy, including South Sydney claims that Western Suburbs scored two tries off forward passes and that South Sydney had two fair tries disallowed.\nWests went on to win the premiership and Bishop stood down as a referee after the game ended. In the aftermath, Souths captain reportedly never spoke to Bishop again despite both of them living in the same suburb for many years. In total, Bishop refereed 223 first grade matches from 1938 to 1952.\nIn 1955, Bishop became part of the national selection panel who selected the Australian team. Bishop was later sacked from the panel after he was accused of leaking information that Harry Wells had been dropped from Australia's Third Test team against France."

It was originally to have taken place from 9 to 31 May 2020, as the 103rd edition of the Giro d'Italia, a three-week Grand Tour. The start of the 2020 Giro (known as the \"Grande Partenza\") had been planned to take place in Budapest, Hungary, which would have been the 14th time the Giro has started outside Italy, and the first time a Grand Tour has visited Hungary.\nThe event was jeopardised by the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, and in March 2020 it was postponed, as other early season races in Italy had been. When the government of Hungary announced they would not allow the Grande Partenza to take place, RCS Sport decided they would postpone the race to a later to-be-determined date. On 15 April, UCI announced that both Giro and Vuelta would take place in autumn after the 2020 UCI Road World Championships. On 5 May, UCI announced that the Giro would take place between 3 and 25 October, overlapping with the 2020 Vuelta a España .\nThe race was won by Tao Geoghegan Hart of Great Britain and Ineos Grenadiers, who finished 39 seconds ahead of Australia's Jai Hindley, having taken over leadership of his team after pre-race favourite and teammate Geraint Thomas had crashed out at an early stage. Geoghehan Hart also won the young riders' jersey, and became the first rider in Giro history to win the pink jersey outright on the final stage, having never worn it during the race – he entered the decisive final day time-trial level on time, but second on countback, to Hindley. The mountains jersey as won by Ruben Guerreiro and the sprinters' prize went to Simon Pellaud.\nTeams.\nTwenty-two teams participated in the 2020 Giro d'Italia. All nineteen UCI WorldTeams are entitled, and obliged, to enter the race. Additionally, three second-tier UCI ProTeams were invited to participate in the event. The teams were announced on 16 January 2020. On 13 October 2020, ahead of the start of stage 10, Mitchelton-Scott and Jumbo-Visma withdrew all their remaining riders from the race following positive COVID-19 tests.\nThe teams participating in the race were:\nUCI WorldTeams\nUCI ProTeams\nPre-race favourites.\nGeraint Thomas (), the 2018 Tour de France champion, was considered the pre-race favourite. Simon Yates () was seen as one of his main challengers after beating Thomas in the lead-up race Tirreno–Adriatico. Steven Kruijswijk (), a previous race leader in 2016, was another top contender, as was the only past champion in the field – two-time winner Vincenzo Nibali (). 's trio of Jakob Fuglsang, Miguel Ángel López and Aleksandr Vlasov were also seen as top contenders. Other riders considered as contenders included Rafał Majka () and Wilco Kelderman (). Remco Evenepoel () was earlier considered a favourite but did not enter the race due to injuries sustained in Il Lombardia.\nRiders believed to be the main contenders for victories on the sprint stages were Arnaud Démare (), Fernando Gaviria (), Peter Sagan (), Elia Viviani () and Michael Matthews ()."

        "title": "2021 Giro d'Italia",
        "text": "The 2021 Giro d'Italia was the 104th edition of the Giro, a three-week Grand Tour cycling stage race. It started on 8 May and finished on 30 May. On 26 May 2019, the race organisers RCS Sport originally announced that the start of the 2021 Giro (known as the \"Grande Partenza\") would be in Sicily, Italy. However, on 4 February 2021, RCS Sport announced that the race would instead start in Turin, with the rest of the race route being announced on 24 February 2021.\nThe race was won by Egan Bernal of , winning his first Giro title and his second Grand Tour victory overall. He became the second Colombian to win the Giro after Nairo Quintana did so in 2014. He first took the \"maglia rosa\" when he won atop the gravel finish at Campo Felice on stage 9. He proceeded to extend his lead in the second week, culminating in his victory on the shortened queen stage to Cortina d'Ampezzo. Despite his difficulties in the final week, he still had enough advantage to confirm his victory in Milan. He won by 1' 29\" ahead of Damiano Caruso of . Going into the race, Caruso was initially supposed to be a domestique for his team's original leader, Mikel Landa. After Landa crashed out on stage 5, Caruso took up the mantle as the team's leader. Caruso proceeded to consistently get high placings on the mountain stages before taking a stage victory on the last mountain stage to Alpe Motta. The last place on the podium was occupied by Simon Yates of , 4' 15\" behind Bernal. After constantly losing time in the first two weeks, Yates peaked in the third week, leading to him taking a stage victory on the summit finish to Alpe di Mera.\nIn the race's other classifications, Peter Sagan of took the points classification title. He first took the \"maglia ciclamino\" after winning the sprint on stage 10. Geoffrey Bouchard of took the mountains classification title after consistently taking maximum points on the stages' early climbs. As a result of him winning the \"maglia rosa\", Bernal also took home the young riders classification as the best-placed rider under the age of 25. Dries De Bondt of took home the titles in the intermediate sprint classification and the combativity classification while Simon Pellaud of won the breakaway classification as the rider who had the highest number of kilometres on the breakaway. In the team classifications, Ineos Grenadiers took home the \"Trofeo Fast Team\" as the team whose top three riders had the lowest aggregate time while Team Bahrain Victorious took home the fair play classification as one of the three teams who did not get any sanction in the whole race. They won the tiebreaker as a result of Caruso taking the second place in the GC.\nTeams.\nTwenty-three teams received invitations to participate in the 2021 Giro d'Italia. All nineteen UCI WorldTeams were entitled and obliged to enter the race, and they were joined by four second-tier UCI ProTeams. , the best-performing UCI ProTeam in 2020, received an automatic invitation, while the other three teams were selected by RCS Sport, the organisers of the Giro. and continued their streak of wild card invitations to the race, while made its Grand Tour debut. The teams were announced on 10 February 2021.\nOn 15 April 2021, after positive doping tests for Matteo Spreafico and Matteo De Bonis left them facing a potential suspension, withdrew their participation from the race. As a result, regular invitee , which had participated in the last three Giros but had initially missed out on an invitation, were awarded the last wildcard invitation.\nThe teams participating in the race are:\nUCI WorldTeams\nUCI ProTeams\nPre-race favourites.\nThe pre-race favourites were the 2019 Tour de France champion Egan Bernal () and Simon Yates (), who won the lead-up race, Tour of the Alps. Their main challenger was considered to be Remco Evenepoel (), despite not having raced since a crash in the 2020 Il Lombardia. Other top contenders were Hugh Carthy (), after his third place in the 2020 Vuelta a España, former podium finisher Mikel Landa (), Emanuel Buchmann (), Aleksandr Vlasov (), Pavel Sivakov (), and two \"Maglia Rosa\" wearers from the 2020 edition – João Almeida () and Jai Hindley (), the eventual 2020 runner-up. Multiple Grand Tour winner Vincenzo Nibali also started the race, but due to only recently having recovered from injury, was not mentioned among the favourites.\nRiders believed to be the main contenders for victories on the sprint stages were Caleb Ewan (), Peter Sagan (), Dylan Groenewegen (), Fernando Gaviria (), Elia Viviani (), Giacomo Nizzolo () and Tim Merlier ().\nRoute and stages.\nThe full route, consisting of 21 stages covering a distance of and an elevation gain of over , was announced by RCS Sport on 24 February 2021. The race was bookended by two individual time trials in Turin and Milan, respectively. There were six summit finishes, the first of which is on stage 6 to Ascoli Piceno. The summit finishes also included the infamous Monte Zoncolan on stage 14 and three of the last five stages. There were also six stages designed for the sprinters to contest and two rest days, after the tenth and sixteenth stages.\nThough stage 16 to Cortina d'Ampezzo did not feature a summit finish, it was initially earmarked as the queen stage by race organisers, as riders were due to cover over of elevation gain, and the Passo Pordoi was due to award the Cima Coppi award to the first rider to cross it as the highest climb of the race. However, due to poor weather, the stage was rerouted to remove the Pordoi and Fedaia, significantly shortening it and leaving the Passo Giau as the only climb in the Dolomites. With the removal of the Passo Pordoi, the Passo Giau also became the Cima Coppi of the race.\nThe nineteenth stage was also changed three days before it was run. The original route had the riders climb the Mottarone climb and then descend into Gignese, however, following the Stresa–Mottarone cable car crash, the route was changed out of respect to those affected to remove the climb, leading the riders straight to Gignese. The stage was shortened by .\nRace Overview.\nThe Big Start towards central Italy.\nThe Giro was originally slated to have its stage one Big Start in Sicily, but it was relocated to begin in Turin.\nThe first stage was a prologue-like short individual time trial just under nine kilometres long. Filippo Ganna won the stage and pink jersey with Edoardo Affini and Tobias Foss making up the rest of the stage podium. This was the second year in a row Ganna won the opening stage. Riders from took 1st and 10th place as riders from and took six of the other eight places in the top 10. The gap between the important GC riders was wide, from the newcomer Foss and João Almeida finishing 3rd and 4th to Egan Bernal and Mikel Landa finishing 24th and 77th. A three-man breakaway broke clear as soon as the flag dropped on stage 2. The break, composed of Vincenzo Albanese (), Umberto Marengo (), and Filippo Tagliani () were allowed to build up a gap of +4:20 before the peloton began to bring them back with Albanese taking the points for the mountains jersey. The sprinter's teams did their work neutralizing and exterminating the breakaway threat, setting up a final sprint where Tim Merlier won the day ahead of Giacomo Nizzolo and Elia Viviani. As a result of this victory Merlier took over the lead in the points classification and would defend it for the next few stages.\nPrior to the start of stage 2 a moment of silence was held in memory of Wouter Weylandt.\nStage 3 began with heavy rain, but despite the conditions an escape bunch of seven riders eventually formed with Albanese among them as he was seeking to defend his mountains jersey, which he was able to do. Eventually the weather cleared and the gap of the escapees grew to over +6:00 before the peloton began reeling them in. Specifically it was the team of Peter Sagan who turned up the pace in an attempt to drop Sagan's rivals and set him up to go for the stage win. With 100 kilometres to go Maciej Bodnar was at the front for Team Bora and the gap was down to +4:20 and continuing to drop. For the majority of the stage Team Bora was the only team doing the chasing. With the peloton continuously closing the gap late in the stage Simon Pellaud made an attack and Taco van der Hoorn was the only other rider able to stay with him. With about ten kilometres to go teams and began assisting in bringing back the final escapees in order to give their sprinters a chance at the win. With about nine kilometres to go van der Hoorn launched an attack which dropped Pellaud. As a result, he was the last man up the road during the final few kilometres and he managed to beat the hard charging peloton to the finish line by just four seconds as Davide Cimolai took 2nd and Sagan settled for 3rd. The overall situation had Ganna in the lead by approximately +0:20 ahead of Foss, Almeida, Evenepoel and Cavagna. Stage 4 was another overcast, dreary day except this time the rain was worse towards the end of the stage. A breakaway of 25 riders eventually formed as groups of differing riders attacked, which would eventually produce the stage winner. The gap opened up to +5:00 in relatively little time, but this group didn't build a large enough lead where it would be a certainty the winner would come from it. Francesco Gavazzi () attacked the small categorized climbs to defend the mountains jersey of his teammate Albanese and about midway through the stage Christopher Juul-Jensen launched an attack at the front of the breakaway which only Quinten Hermans and Rein Taaramäe answered. Hermans was dropped before long and for much of the day Juul-Jensen and Taramae led the race with Taaramäe being in a position to take the pink jersey if the attack was successful. Eventually the duo was caught, by another duo of Alessandro De Marchi of () and Joe Dombrowski of (), both of whom had the opportunity to take the race lead. Dombrowski launched the decisive attack with four kilometres to go and soloed to the line for the stage win, rising to 2nd in the overall standings and also taking over the lead in the mountains classification as De Marchi crossed the finish line in 2nd, but took over the pink jersey. As far as the GC contenders were concerned Aleksandr Vlasov was the highest placed in 7th overall, Evenepoel was in 8th, Hugh Carthy, who finished on the podium in the most recent Grand Tour, was in 10th, Bernal in 11th, Landa in 15th, former winner of all three grand tours Vincenzo Nibali in 25th and Tobias Foss had fallen from 3rd place overall after stage 1 all the way down to 31st at +2:42 behind the leader.\nStage 5 began with Filippo Tagliani of () and Umberto Marengo attacking early. Due to the success of breakaways during the first week the peloton did not give them much room and they were brought back with just over 100 kilometres remaining in the stage. Another group of three riders attacked later in the stage, but they were caught with 3 kilometres to go as the leadout trains got up to speed for the sprint finish. Caleb Ewan won the day as Nizzolo took 2nd who was followed by Viviani, Sagan and Fernando Gaviria. Nizzolo took over the lead in the points classification from Merlier. During the stage Joe Dombrowski, who was in position to possibly take the pink jersey in the coming stages, hit a race official which caused a multi-rider crash. Pre-race favorite Mikel Landa was seriously injured with broken ribs and a broken collarbone and had to abandon the race leaving Damiano Caruso, a career Domestique, as the team leader for Bahrain Victorious. Dombrowski finished the stage; but after the stage he was evaluated by team medical staff and the following morning he posted a video to fans on social media where he stated, \"Hi guys, unfortunately today I won’t be able to start here at the Giro. We did the concussion protocol last night, then followed up again this morning and just... I didn’t pass that, so with the doctors in the team we decided that it was not safe for me to start today.\" François Bidard was also involved in the crash, and he too would not survive to finish the race. De Marchi kept his lead, Louis Vervaeke moved into Dombrowski's spot and he was followed by Nelson Oliveira and Attila Valter who was leading the best young rider classification. During stage 6 several riders went clear during the first kilometres but Team was able to control this initial breakaway. Eventually, six riders went clear about into the stage, while the duo of Geoffrey Bouchard () and Bauke Mollema () soon gave chase and after a considerable pursuit managed to bridge the gap to the break. The eight-rider break built an advantage of around five and a half minutes. At this point, yet again, the rain began to fall heavily. Eventually Gino Mäder would make a move and attack this group and win the stage as well as take the lead in the mountains classification. The GC riders were very close behind at the finish with Egan Bernal, Remco Evenepoel and Dan Martin coming in at +0:12, and they were followed soon after by Giulio Ciccone, Damiano Caruso and Dani Martinez, who was proving to be the strongest Super-Domestique in the field riding in support of Bernal. Attila Valter survived not far behind these elite riders and moved into the pink jersey, a few seconds ahead of the now 2nd place Evenepoel and 3rd place Bernal. Martin, Ciccone and Yates all moved into the top 10.\nLate in the stage a controversial incident occurred with around to go. As a team car tried to pull up alongside an official race car to collect rain jackets left behind from their riders, the car ran into the back of rider Pieter Serry, who had just been dropped from the group ahead. Serry managed to escape without injuries before going on to finish the stage. The occupants of the car were both team managers. The driver was expelled from the race and the passenger was given a fine. From the hotel Serry received a phone call and an apology over the incident, which he accepted saying it wasn't a big deal and could have been worse.\nStage 7 saw a trio of riders attack right at the start. Pellaud, Marengo and Mark Christian. Pellaud and Marengo would be involved in numerous breakaway attempts and therefore were highly placed in the Breakaway, Combative Rider and Intermediate Sprints classifications throughout the race. In the end it was a stage for the sprinters and inside the final kilometre as the leadout was in progress Fernando Gaviria made a surprise attack to steal the win but was caught just before the line by Cimolai, Merlier and Ewan, who won the stage and for the first time in his career, the points jersey in a grand tour.\nCentral Italy to the Alps.\nStage 8 began in Foggia and early in the stage it was crosswinds causing weather related issues as a few splits formed in the main field. An hour or so later things settled down and a breakaway formed. This edition of the breakaway was given some rope, as none of the riders were deemed a threat to the pink jersey of Groupama–FDJ. Gaviria joined the group in search of points and he was joined by Victor Campenaerts of Team Qhubeka, holder of the 'Fastest Hour' record since April 2019. Gaviria took many of the intermediate sprint points and at the end of the day Merlier would move back into the lead in the points classification. Victor Lafay would make the successful move from within the escape bunch and solo for his first career stage win. Francesco Gavazzi made a late attack in an attempt to catch Lafay but came in over +0:30 later with Nikias Arndt right behind him. There were no changes in the overall situation. Stage 9 was the first of seven stages in the 2021 Giro labeled \"D\", for severe difficulty, because of the hard climbing as well as the final 1.6 kilometres being unpaved \"sterrato\". Tomasz Marczyński did not start (DNS) the stage due to struggling with post-covid symptoms. There were several attacks throughout the stage including stage winners Mäder and Lafay trying to get an escape started, then thirty kilometres into stage another attempt was made but UAE Team Emirates missed getting a rider into the group and therefore worked at the front of the peloton to bring the group back before they ever had the chance to get away. It started raining again and more escape attempts came, including a final group of 17 riders, which teams FDJ and Ineos rode to control at the front of the main field. Mäder took mountains points early in the day to defend his jersey, but by the end of the stage Geoffrey Bouchard would overtake him and wouldn't relinquish the mountains jersey for the rest of the Giro. In the end the GC riders would fight it out for the win. Gianni Moscon and Dani Martinez rode strongly for Ineos, setting the pace for Egan Bernal. As the end of the stage approached, the gravel section, the final escapees included Mollema of Trek and Michael Storer of DSM chasing the duo of Koen Bouwman riding for Jumbo-Visma and Bouchard of AG2R. With 500 metres to go Vlasov made an attack from the GC group which only Bernal and Ciccone answered. Bernal then put his stamp of authority on the race by attacking again which Ciccone answered briefly and with 400 metres to go they passed the final breakaway riders like they were standing still. Bernal kept the pressure on and crossed the line solo seven seconds ahead of Vlasov and Ciccone. A few seconds later Evenepoel and Martin crossed and two seconds behind them was a group including Almeida, Martinez, Damiano Caruso and Romain Bardet. Valter was dropped and lost the pink jersey to Bernal, but it was late in the stage and he still clung to the top 5 behind Ciccone, Vlasov and Evenepoel. During the stage Matej Mohorič was involved in a serious crash when he hit a crack in the road and was violently thrown over his handlebars as the front wheel completely broke off his bike. He hit his head with force, but never lost consciousness and only abandoned the race due to the insistence of team medical staff.\nStage 10 was a flat stage and the escapes came early in the stage. Marengo and Pellaud went off the front yet again and they were joined by van der Hoorn, Samuele Rivi of team and eventually Kobe Goossens of team . Team Bora rode hard to see to it this escape group was destroyed and the rivals of Sagan were put under as much pressure as possible and if possible, ejected out the back of the peloton. \nCesare Benedetti, Felix Grosschartner and Matteo Fabbro forced the pace through the foothills and Emanuel Buchmann, Giovanni Aleotti and Daniel Oss kept the pressure on throughout the day and several elite sprinters were dropped including Nizzolo, Merlier and Dylan Groenewegen. With 43 kilometres to go the breakaway was absorbed back into the bunch and while they had run into a spot of bad luck being forced to stop and wait at a train crossing, the race jury determined this wouldn't have changed the inevitability of the peloton eventually catching them. Inside the final five kilometres Maciej Bodnar set the pace and inside the final three kilometres Team DSM came to the front to get their sprinter, Max Kanter, into position but there was a crash that took out many riders including Kanter. Bernal and Vlasov were also caught up in this, but it was inside the final three kilometres so they didn't lose time. As the finish approached Sagan started his sprint from very far out betting on himself to be able to hold off any pursuers and it paid off as he claimed the win ahead of Gaviria and Cimolai. Sagan also took over the lead in the points classification and would not relinquish it for the remainder of the race. The next day was the first rest day.\nStage 11 contained several gravel sections and the initial breakaway of eleven riders eventually opened up a gap of approximately +14:00 before it started coming down, meaning the stage winner would likely come from the group. These eleven riders stayed out front for most of the day and eventually began attacking one another in the fight for the win. In the GC group there were several attacks and a few highly placed riders dropped out of the top 10 as they were eventually dropped as a result of the pace set by Team Ineos, specifically Filippo Ganna who was trying to create problems for the opponents of Bernal. Remco Evenepoel, who was in 2nd place overall fell into difficulty on the gravel sectors and his teammate João Almeida had to fall back and assist him. He would wind up losing about +2:00 and fall from 2nd to 7th place. Regarding the stage win initially three riders were in the best position in Dries De Bondt, Mauro Schmid and Alessandro Covi but De Bondt would eventually be dropped as Harm Vanhoucke would escape the remnants of the breakaway group. In the end the stage was won by Mauro Schmid, in what was described as a memorable fashion as he overpowered Covi when it came down to the finish. In the GC situation Aleksandr Vlasov was now the only rider within a minute of Bernal as Damiano Caruso rode strongly and rose in the standings to occupy the final podium position. He was followed by Hugh Carthy and Simon Yates as Emanuel Buchmann moved from outside the top 10 to 6th place overall just over +0:30 ahead of 7th place Evenepoel.\nDuring stage 12 a group of sixteen riders eventually broke away and for the second day in a row built an insurmountable gap of over +12:00. Bouchard joined in yet again to collect mountains classification points and built on his lead over Bernal who was defending his overall lead. There were multiple crashes in the stage which would cause the eventual abandons of Alessandro De Marchi and Marc Soler, who was in 11th place overall when he left the race. Among the GC riders there were no major changes and at the end of the day the stage win would be decided from a final group of four riders including Gianluca Brambilla, George Bennett, Andrea Vendrame and Chris Hamilton. Hamilton and Vendrame would get away from Bennett and Brambilla with Vendrame claiming the victory in the two up sprint.\nStage 13 was a return to the flats where the breakaway was limited in number due to the reality of the sprinters' teams being unlikely to give any would-be escapees much chance of success. Three riders eventually formed an escape group, all of whom were familiar faces in the breakaways thus far in the Giro – Samuele Rivi, Umberto Marengo and Simon Pellaud. At most they had a gap of about seven minutes but the peloton gradually brought them back. They managed to survive until inside the final ten kilometres before the sprinters' teams took control. In the end, the sprint was won by Giacomo Nizzolo who narrowly edged out Edoardo Affini. Affini was actually the leadout man for Dylan Groenewegen, however Groenewegen didn't time his sprint properly and finished 10th whereas Affini didn't even realize he rode so strongly and finished 2nd. Fernando Gaviria, who normally would have been competing for a sprint finish like this, suffered a mechanical where he lost his seat in the final kilometre of the race. He was out of the saddle for the entire final kilometre of the stage, yet despite this he still managed a top 5 finish. He described the end of the stage by saying, \"It was one of the longest kilometers of my life\". The GC situation saw no major changes.\nThe High Mountains and Third Week.\nNeither Dylan Groenewegen nor David Dekker started stage 14 as a result of tactical decisions made by the management of before the start of the race. For Dekker it was because this was the first time in his career he had raced every day for two straight weeks and the elite sprinter Groenewegen was just coming back after a considerable absence from racing. GC contender Jai Hindley also did not start the stage. The stage began with the first 130 kilometres or so being mostly flat and a breakaway group got a gap of just under nine minutes. put in a lot of the work at the front of the main field and was attempting to get Aleksandr Vlasov in a good position for the upcoming climb on Monte Zoncolan. Edoardo Affini and Jacopo Mosca put in a great deal of work at the front of the breakaway group in an attempt to get their teammates George Bennett and Bauke Mollema the opportunity to go for the stage win. The group still had a gap of about 6 minutes as the Zoncolan began. Jan Tratnik attacked the breakaway group and only Lorenzo Fortunato eventually made the move to go with him although Alessandro Covi, Bennett and Mollema were not far behind initially. In the end Fortunato beat Tratnik to the line by about thirty seconds to claim the stage win. In the GC situation, the most important attack of the day came from Simon Yates, which no one could initially answer. Egan Bernal eventually went after him and passed him. Bernal crossed the finish line in 4th place, gaining 11 seconds on Yates and more than that on everyone else. In the overall situation he now led Yates in 2nd place by +1:33 and Damiano Caruso in 3rd place by +1:51. Vlasov fell to 4th and he was followed by Carthy, Buchmann, Ciccone and Remco Evenepoel who held on to remain in 8th place at +3:52. 9th place was now occupied by Bernal's teammate Dani Martínez, who was proving himself to be the strongest Super-Domestique in the race.\nStage 15 began with a serious crash involving dozens of riders barely three minutes after 'the race is on' was declared, forcing race officials to neutralize the race for 35 minutes while bikes were fixed or replaced and torn clothes were changed. The sprinter Giacomo Nizzolo did not start the stage having suffered too much over the previous mountain stages and as a result of the crash Natnael Berhane, Jos van Emden and Emanuel Buchmann, who was still in 6th place overall, abandoned the race. Late in the stage it began raining, which worked to the benefit of the breakaway group which had built enough of a gap to ensure the winner would come from among them. In the end seven riders were within ten seconds at the finish line where Victor Campenaerts of narrowly defeated Oscar Riesebeek of for the stage win. The GC situation remained the same, but due to the withdrawal of Buchmann Tobias Foss, who had fallen as low as 31st place earlier in the race, entered the top 10.\nStage 16 was intended to be the Queen Stage and was scheduled to begin in Sacile and cover 212 kilometres before ending in Cortina d'Ampezzo. The temperature at the start was with rain, which meant in the high mountain passes it would be snowing. As a result, race officials decided to eliminate a total of 59 kilometres, including the scheduled Cima Coppi leaving only the La Crosseta and Giau Pass as major climbs to be dealt with, with the Giau becoming the new Cima Coppi at . The new stage total would be 153 kilometres and 153 riders signed in to start the stage with veteran Thomas de Gendt being added to the DNS list as he was suffering with knee pain. Initially there was breakaway group of 24 riders with many very strong riders among them including some GC caliber riders who were no longer contending for the overall win in Vincenzo Nibali, João Almeida and Dan Martin as well as several others including Davide Formolo, Antonio Pedrero and Geoffrey Bouchard who was tightening his grip on the King of the Mountains competition. The maximum advantage they were able to build was only about five minutes and by the time of the final climb the deficit back to the GC favorites group of Bernal was only about a minute. There were many attacks from within this group and among them Nibali, Formolo and Pedrero were riding very strong, but eventually Bernal launched an attack to break the rest of his competitors and put a stranglehold on his lead. Vlasov suffered a mechanical at an inopportune time and was dropped from the GC group, Yates was not able to match Bernal's pace, neither was Carthy and Evenepoel came unhinged and lost over twenty minutes by the end of the day. Bernal was the first across the summit of the Giau Pass and maintained his lead all the way to the finish line to take his second stage win. The only two riders who finished within a minute of him were Romain Bardet and Damiano Caruso who both crossed the line at +0:27. Following the win Bernal said, \"I wanted to put on a show, this is the kind of cycling I like, when it's wet and cold and you need grit\". In the overall situation Bernal now led 2nd place Caruso by +2:24. In 3rd was Hugh Carthy and he was followed by Vlasov, Yates and Giulio Ciccone each of whom were over four minutes behind. The next day was the second and final rest day.\nStage 17 would include another day of several hard climbs and the breakaway attempts would begin early in the day, though the escapees would not find much success in the first fifty or so kilometres due to the efforts of Team Ineos. Once the break was away Team Bike Exchange worked to limit their advantage. Eventually a group of nearly twenty would break free including Gianni Moscon, Antonio Pedrero, Dan Martin, Geoffrey Bouchard, Giovanni Carboni of Team and Simone Ravanelli of Team . Dan Martin attacked the surviving escape group at the bottom of the final climb as the GC group was only about ninety seconds behind. In the GC group Almeida made an attack no one else answered. He was in 10th place overall so wasn't a major threat to Bernal and eventually Simon Yates launched an attack of his own with four kilometres to go. This attack was a bit more noticeable as he was in 5th overall, and initially it put Bernal into a bit of difficulty. By the end of the day Dan Martin won the stage. This victory made him one of only about a hundred cyclists to win a stage in all three grand tours. As he retired at the end of the 2021 season this ended up being the fifth and final grand tour stage win of his career. In the GC situation Almeida crossed the line 2nd, and jumped up to 8th place overall, in the process he became the team leader of being as Evenepoel had a tough day and would not start stage 18. Yates finished 3rd and also moved into 3rd in the overall standings. Bernal had Dani Martínez assisting him throughout the stage and limited his losses to under a minute on Yates. Bernal led Caruso by +2:21 and Yates by +3:23. Vlasov, Carthy and Bardet trailed by more than +6:00 and 7th was now occupied by Bernal's teammate Dani Martínez.\nStage 18 saw 147 riders sign in to start the stage. In addition to Evenepoel, Nicholas Schultz and Giulio Ciccone of would not start. Not feeling strong enough to start after the crash he suffered the previous day, Ciccone gave up his 10th place in the GC. Right from the starting gun the attacks came in an attempt to get a breakaway formed. For the first 30 kilometres or so all attempts were frustrated, but eventually a group of about two dozen riders broke clear. Stage 18 was the longest of the race at 231 kilometres and it would be a hilly finish with four small climbs, one of which was categorized, which meant this would be the last opportunity for Davide Cimolai, Fernando Gaviria and Elia Viviani to gain on Peter Sagan in the points classification being as the final three stages were mountains stages and a time trial. Sagan would maintain his lead and by the end of the day the stage win was going to come from the breakaway yet again. had several riders fighting for this win including Roche, Arndt and Denz and other riders including Natnael Tesfatsion and Filippo Zana were in contention as the end of stage approached. As was Rémi Cavagna who had attacked the breakaway and rode off on his own, but eventually Alberto Bettiol of Team was able to drop all of the remaining breakaway riders, including Cavagna, and solo to victory. Essentially being a flat stage there were no major changes atop the general classification.\nStage 19 was a high mountain stage, but saw a small change in its original route due to a tragic cable car crash a few days earlier. The peloton decided to give all of the prize money from stage 19 to the victims of this incident.\nThe first true breakaway formed about thirty kilometres into the stage, but they never extended their advantage much beyond +4:00 meaning the day would likely be decided in a battle between GC riders. drove a hard pace for the benefit of Yates and Team \n rode hard throughout the stage for Almeida attempting to get him in position to climb up in the GC and go for a stage win. At times the pace was so ferocious that the peloton split into two groups catching out Bernal's most important lieutenant Dani Martínez. The powerful ITT specialist Filippo Ganna dropped back to assist Martínez in getting back to this group so he could be there for Bernal at the end of the stage. By the time of the final climb only one final breakaway rider remained in Mark Christian, of Team , but with the pace of the GC riders it was inevitable he would be caught and dropped off the back, which he soon was. With about seven kilometres to go Almeida launched an attack to go for the stage win. With 6.3 kilometres to go Yates also attacked and he was joined by Bennett, Vlasov and Caruso as Jonathan Castroviejo and Martínez made sure Bernal would not fall into danger of losing serious time. Hugh Carthy, fighting for 5th place in the GC, also left the Maglia Rosa group in pursuit of the elite group at the front of the race. With 5.5 kilometres to go Yates attacked this group and went off on his own as Martínez took control of the group behind causing several more riders to be dropped. For the next three kilometres Carthy, Vlasov, Bennett and Almeida had fallen back to the Bernal group as Yates struggled to force a gap, but eventually managed to get away. At one point he would have a lead close to +0:40, as Bernal clung to the wheel of Martínez biding his time. Martínez would pull Yates back to within +0:24 when finally, with 2.5 kilometres to go Bernal went off in pursuit, only taking Almeida with him. Almeida came within about ten seconds of catching Yates as Bernal lost just under thirty seconds, while gaining an additional four seconds over Caruso.\nStage 20 was the final stage in the high mountains and it turned into a battle of Damiano Caruso trying to win the stage and the Giro d'Italia. Caruso had teammate Pello Bilbao to assist him much of the stage as Michael Storer and Romain Bardet of Team DSM were at or near the front of the race for most of the day. In the end Caruso had managed to drop everyone and was riding for the stage win and solidifying his 2nd place overall as Yates was unable to stay with either Caruso or Bernal. Dani Martínez gave maximum effort to keep Caruso within striking distance and as the end of the stage neared Bernal rode off in pursuit of Caruso limiting his losses to +0:24. Eleven seconds later Martínez and Bardet crossed the line and the only other riders within a minute were Almeida and Yates. Yates remained in 3rd, now +3:23 behind as Bernal's lead over the surprising Caruso was cut +1:59 going into the final ITT in stage 21.\nOn the final stage in Milan Bernal rode strongly enough to secure his victory. The stage victory went to Filippo Ganna who was able to defeat Cavagna and Affini by over ten seconds. The highest placed GC rider was João Almeida who finished 5th and jumped up to a tie for 5th in the overall classification with Dani Martínez, but the tiebreaker went in favor of Martínez. Romain Bardet, who grew stronger as the race progressed eventually getting as high as 5th overall, had a tough day in the time trial and dropped to 7th place. Vlasov secured his 4th finish and the podium was filled by Yates, Caruso and Bernal. The points classification was won by Peter Sagan, the mountains classification was won by Geoffrey Bouchard, the best young rider was also claimed by Bernal and his team won the team classification. The fair play classification went to of Caruso. Dries De Bondt won the sprints and combativity classifications and the breakaway classification was won by Simon Pellaud.\nWith this victory Egan Bernal won his second grand tour and became the second Colombian rider, after Nairo Quintana, to win the Giro d'Italia."

It is currently sponsored by Mowi (formerly Marine Harvest) who have sponsored the cup since 2014. It is played on a knock-out basis by the teams in the National Division 2 Leagues and is administered by the Women's Camanachd Association. The current holders are Lovat.\nThe Challenge Cup is usually played just before the Women's Shinty Premier Cup competition. The Valerie Fraser Trophy and the two cup finals form a showpiece event in the women's shinty calendar.\n \nFinal history.\nThe trophy has been played for since 2012, when Lochaber defeated Strathglass in the final in the inaugural final.\nStrathglass were successful in 2013, beating Glasgow Mid Argyll.\nThe following year Strathglass retained the trophy, this time beating Lovat 6–4 in the final.\nThe 2015 final was an exciting affair. After a goalless first half, Lauren Pike put GMA in front before Kate Bradley retaliated for Ardnamurchan. Carolanne Cameron then gave Ardnamurchan team the lead with just four minutes left. In the final minute Kirsty Gray equalised and the game went to extra time. The drama continued when Geraldine Murphy gave the lead back to GMA before Cameron scored again for the west highlanders. GMA triumphed 2–0 in the penalty shout out.\nLovat secured their first Challenge Cup win with a comprehensive 7–1 victory over Strathglass in 2016.\nThe 2017 final saw the 2015 runners-up Ardnamurchan again lose out this time to Glengarry who put their name on the trophy for the first time with an emphatic 7–1 win which included a five-minute hat-trick from Leona Falconer.\nIn 2018 two players scored hat-tricks in the final. Glenurguhart teenager Abby Stoddart got hers in the first half. Inverness's Katie Macmillan achieved the same feat but the decisive Glenurquhart goal came from Hazel Hunter's 50th-minute penalty.\nThe 2019 final saw Inverness fall at the final hurdle again, and again two players scored hat-tricks. This time the victors were Lovat who ran out 7-1 winners. Fiona Urquhart and Lovat captain Laura Gallacher both scored hat-tricks."

He played for Balmain and Cronulla-Sutherland in the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) competition. His brother Jamie Davidson also played for Balmain between 1983 and 1987.\nBackground.\nDavidson was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia and played his junior rugby league for Birchgrove Scorpions.\nPlaying career.\nDavidson made his first grade debut for Balmain in Round 6 1980 against Penrith at Leichhardt Oval. In 1981, Davidson played 10 games as Balmain finished last on the table claiming the wooden spoon. It was only the 4th time in the club's history where they had finished last. By 1983, Balmain coach Frank Stanton had assembled a strong team and the club reached the finals but were defeated in the semi-final by St George. In 1984, Balmain missed the finals after a disappointing season but Davidson did finish as the club's top point scorer.\nBy 1985, Balmain were genuine title contenders and finished second on the table. The club were then eliminated from the finals series after back to back losses with Davidson featuring in both games. In 1986, Balmain again reached the finals but were defeated by an experienced Canterbury side in the preliminary final. It was a similar story the following year in 1987 as the club reached the finals but fell short of a grand final appearance.\nIn the 1988 season, Balmain finally reached the grand final after years of heartbreak defeating Cronulla in the preliminary final. Davidson played in the first finals game against Penrith scoring a try but missed out on selection in the grand final which Balmain lost against Canterbury 24–12.\nIn 1989, Davidson joined Cronulla who had finished minor premiers the year before. Davidson played in the club's semi final defeat against eventual premiers Canberra. Davidson retired following the conclusion of the 1990 season."

        "title": "Basketball in China",
        "text": "The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most popular sports league in China, edging over the Premier League, UEFA Champions League, FIFA World Cup, La Liga, Serie A, and UEFA European Football Championship as the most popular sports event. The popularity of basketball in China has been supported by the Chinese Basketball Association which hosts professional play in China. In international competition, the Chinese men's national team has won 16 titles of the FIBA Asia Cup between 1975 and 2005 and is the dominant force in Asian basketball. Six Chinese nationals have played in National Basketball Association. The most famous Chinese basketball player is Yao Ming who became the first player to score an average of 20+10 in his rookie NBA season, an elected member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and the incumbent president of the Chinese Basketball Association.\nHistory.\nThe Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) brought basketball to China when they established the first YMCA in Tianjin in 1895, four years after the first game of basketball was played at Spring Field College (a YMCA Training School at the time) in Massachusetts, United States of America. The sport spread quickly due to it not requiring many resources to play. The growth of basketball throughout China spread fast enough that it was an event in the 1910 and 1914 National Games, only 15 years after the first YMCA in China. This can also be due to the YMCA's heavy involvement in the preparation of the events due to the failings of the Late Qing Dynasty. During this time, China started competing internationally in basketball. This started with the First Far Eastern Championship Games in 1913. This event, where they competed in basketball, was held in Manila, Philippine between three nations: China, Japan, and the Philippines. By 1935, basketball was voted upon by the citizens of China to be one of the two national sports alongside ping pong.\nAfter the formation of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, China looked to sports, including basketball, as a way to create diplomatic relations. It started within the Socialist Bloc where China sent teams to compete against other socialist nations such as Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. It eventually spread to other countries such as Switzerland and France in 1959. Teams were eventually travelling around the world including the United States post ping pong diplomacy in the 1970s. China captured their first Olympic medal in 1984 in Los Angeles when the women's team brought home a bronze medal defeating Canada. The sport has reached its maximum popularity with the emergence of the National Basketball Association’s (NBA) popularity in large part due to Yao Ming becoming a hall of fame player in the United States. China hosted the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\nHistory of NBA In China.\nOn August 24, 1979, the team formerly known as the Washington Bullets, now known as the Washington Wizards, was the first NBA team to be invited to China. There were two exhibition games, which the Bullets participated in, and the opposing teams were the Chinese national team and the Bayi Rockets. NBA relations and popularity continued to rise as Chinese state media televised NBA games in the ’80s. NBA games being televised in China was due to the efforts of David Stern, as he signed a deal with the states and gave broadcasting rights to China Central Television (CCTV) for free. Regardless of the fact that basketball had been played in China for a long time, this was the country's first official exposure to the NBA. This occurred during the peak of NBA players such as Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson. This led to an amassment of over 450 million fans in China.\nIn 2002, Yao Ming, a 7’6\" (2.29 m) center from Shanghai, China, was drafted by the Houston Rockets. Yao Ming became the first international player selected as a first overall pick in the draft. The NBA experienced a major frenzy in China as a result of Yao's accomplishment in the league, as his popularity spread throughout the country. After Chinese television stations expanded their NBA coverage, thanks to Yao, the league also saw a massive spike in television ratings. The NBA became the first American professional sports league to compete in China as two Rockets preseason games were played there in 2004, two years after Yao entered the league.\nIn 2007, Yi Jianlian, joined the NBA after his years in the CBA and played on the Milwaukee Bucks. When Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian played in 2007, the NBA game was televised on 13 Chinese Outlets and total viewership amassed to 200 million viewers.\nIn 2019, NBA games were not being televised due to recent problems between the NBA and China. Companies such as Vivo, state broadcaster CCTV, and Tencent suspended all operations with the National Basketball Association.\nIn 2021, the NBA and China relationship is being mended as NBA games are being broadcast on CCTV networks again.\nNBA China Organization.\nIn January 2008, the NBA established NBA China in collaboration with local operations and management. NBA China, which was established in 2008 and managed the league's business operations in the region, is estimated to be worth more than $4 billion. NBA China is headquartered in Beijing and hired over 115 employees through four offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Taipei.\nAll of the league's business in Greater China is managed by the NBA China organization, including television and other media merchandising and marketing.\nIn 2008, ESPN, a Walt Disney Company division, Bank of China Group Investment, Legend Holdings Limited, the holding company for PC manufacturer Lenovo, the Li Ka Shing Foundation, and China Merchants Investments, an affiliate of China Merchants Bank, invested a total of $253 million in order to acquire 11 percent of the preference shares in NBA China.\nIn 2008 the organization NBA China was established under Tim Chen, the former CEO of Microsoft Greater China. Tim Chen joined the NBA in mid-October in 2008 and was appointed as the CEO of the NBA China Organization. In his original four years with Microsoft, Chen forged a productive relationship with Chinese regulators, and he managed to convince governments to buy the licensed software.\nIn 2020 the CEO of the NBA China Organization was Derek Chang, but he decided to step down and the new CEO for the 2020-21 year is Michael Ma. Michael Ma has an MBA from Columbia Business School and a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Rutgers. In May 2020, Michael Ma took over the position of Derek Chang, and Ma was a crucial figure in helping launch NBA China in 2008. He helped grow the league's presence throughout the country through corporate development, sponsorships, media distribution, and gaming.\nPopularity of Basketball in China.\nBasketball was introduced in the late 1890s to China, and the sport gained support quickly. In 1935, basketball was introduced as a national pastime, and in 1936 the Chinese formed a basketball Olympic team due to the popularity of the sport.\nIn the 1950s, the People's Liberation Army (PLA), a branch in China's Army, which consisted of an army of over two million-plus active-duty members, was encouraged to play basketball. Over 80 years, the People's Liberation Army practiced and played basketball to build teamwork and create unison. They also promoted positive messages such as “Boost National Image” or “Friendship First, Competition Second.” The army used to play in teams, and one of the prominent teams was the Bayi Rockets, which were people from the military. The Bayi Rockets were a force in Chinese basketball and produced one of China's first NBA players, Wang Zhizhi.\nIn 2020, about 625 million people in China were fans of basketball, and 143 million people in China were considered hardcore fans, essentially meaning these fans regularly watch and play basketball. 482 million remaining fans were general fans. The number of viewers accumulates to be more than the population of the United States. In order to establish high viewership, the NBA made efforts to grow the Chinese fan base through summer tours and marketing practices to appeal to the primary audience of China.\nThe NBA China has an account on Douyin, the app known as TikTok in China, which has accumulated over 12.3 million followers and collected over 410 million likes. This account published content regularly and was able to amass the following, making the National Basketball Association (NBA) the most followed sports league in the country of China.\nThe NBA also deals with WeChat, a Chinese social app, where fans follow their favorite players, favorite teams, and live games. The NBA has approximately 1.4 million followers on Tencent's WeChat app.\nOn the Weibo platform, an app similar to Twitter in China, the NBA accumulated over 44 million followers on the forum. Weibo features exclusive content, such as player interviews. These partnerships increased basketball's popularity by making the organization more accessible to Chinese citizens.\nBasketball's Scholarly Influence in China.\nIn November 2011, NBA China and Dongguan New Century launched the CBA Dongguan Basketball School for players ages 12–17. In February 2014, Yao Ming collaborated with the NBA China organization in opening the first afterschool basketball program in Beijing. Collaboratively both were able to provide fitness and basketball training for kids of all ages. By October 2014, The National Basketball Association and China's Ministry of Education revealed a multi-year collaboration October 2014 to integrate an exercise and basketball development curriculum into the schools around the country. By October 2016, the NBA announced that it would open academies in Urumqi, Jinan, and Hangzhou, after playing 12 preseason games in four cities. The NBA opened the academies to support the community of China and the influence the NBA has on China.\nControversy &amp; Consequences.\nOn October 4, 2019, Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, posted and deleted a tweet regarding Hong Kong. The tweet in question was an image that supported the protest in Hong Kong and the withdrawal of the 2019 Hong Kong extradition bill. On October 5, 2019, the owner of the Rockets, Tilman Fertitta, addressed the controversy by reminding the public that Daryl Morey does not talk on behalf of the Houston Rockets. Daryl Morey later apologized to China and reminded the public that his actions and opinions are not associated with the NBA or Houston Rockets. On October 6, 2019, the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) halted cooperation with Rockets in response to a tweet by Daryl Morey.\nOn October 6, 2019, the NBA made a public statement apologizing on behalf of Daryl Morey but reminded the public that the NBA does not regulate what players, coaches, and staff say due to freedom of speech. On October 7, 2019, American politicians including Ted Cruz, Andrew Yang, and Julian Castro supported Daryl Morey and his tweet and shamed the NBA for apologizing.\nChina has a history of retaliating harshly against companies that refer to its domestic affairs or seem to pose a threat to its authority, as evidently, Chinese leagues, streaming services, sponsors, and partners cut relations with the NBA. The backlash of the tweet was costly for the NBA. Adam Silver, the commissioner of the NBA, reported losses could reach up to $400 million. Adam Silver stated that The China Central Television (CCTV) and other television platforms halted the broadcasting of Houston games.\nViolence From Basketball In China.\nIn 2001 Asian Basketball Championship, a fight broke out between China and Lebanon after the game had ended. The fans of the China team threw objects at the Lebanese players, leaving several bloodied before police broke up the fight.\nA fight that involved Chinese fans and players from China and Puerto Rico took place at a game in Beijing in August 2005. Two Chinese players ran to the opposing team's bench at the end of the game to fight Puerto Rican players. The Puerto Rican players laid a hard foul on a Chinese player. Even though China was leading by a large margin through the game, the attack commenced due to a player getting hurt. The two players who charged were Li Nan and Mo Ke, and the player being fouled was Yi Jianlian. The Puerto Rico center who fouled Yi was Manuel Narvaez. Reports indicated that 3,000 spectators threw objects at the visitor team from Puerto Rico. Visitors attempted to flee to the locker room and the media referred to the night as a “night of shame.” \nA fight involving Chinese players and Brazilian players took place in October 2010. Both sides were holding a friendly warm-up game for the Asians Game. The game took place in Xuchang, Henan Province, but 66 seconds into the game, a fight commenced. Players from both sides engaged in combat and exchanged kicks and punches, ending the game immediately. After the first fight ended, players headed back to their locker rooms, but Brazilian players were assaulted once again by the Chinese, and violence erupted once more. After both fights ended and players on the Brazilian team were left injured. The Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) apologized to the Brazilian players and the organizations, and the CBA put Chinese players’ training on hold before the Asian Games. The CBA organization required Chinese players to attend sportsmanship classes, and the aftermath led to some players and coaches being suspended.\nAugust 18, 2011, a fight involving Bayi Rockets, a Chinese professional team, and Georgetown Hoyas players took place. The game between the two teams was an exhibition game. In the fight, the Hoyas team was attacked as they were making their way back to their locker rooms. A Georgetown fan was hit with a bottle and fell to the ground. The fight ended, and on the following Sunday, captains of both teams met and had a friendly meeting and settled differences with autographed basketballs.\nForeign Players In China.\nThe CBA allowed Foreign Players, such as players from the NBA, to play in the Chinese Basketball Association. The list of Foreign Players includes All-Stars such as Metta World Peace, Stephon Marbury, Gilbert Arenas, Tracy McGrady, and Steve Francis. The CBA also had several NBA veterans who played in the CBA, such as Jeremy Lin, Aaron Brooks, Jimmer Fredette, Randolph Morris, Al Harrington, Lester Hudson, Michael Beasley, Kenyon Martin, Shavlik Randolph&amp; J.R. Smith.\nSimilarly, the WCBA allowed Foreign Players, such as players from the WNBA, to play in the Women's Chinese Basketball Association. The list of Foreign Players includes All-Stars such as Crystal Langhorne, Stefanie Dolson, Candace Parker, and more who currently play or played in the Women's National Basketball Association.\nMen's and Women's Chinese Basketball Association.\nThe Chinese Basketball Association or CBA was established in 1995, which was a Chinese version of the NBA. There are 20 teams in the CBA league that are split into two divisions. There is the Northern Division and the Southern Division.\nThe Women's Chinese Basketball Association (WCBA) was established in 2002 under the CBA. There are 17 teams in the WCBA league with no split in divisions.\nNational League.\nChinese Basketball Association is the national professional basketball league in China.\nNational Team.\nThe China men's national basketball team has won FIBA Asia Cup 15 times."

        "title": "2019 Preakness Stakes",
        "text": "The 2019 Preakness Stakes was the 144th running of the Preakness Stakes, the second leg of the American Triple Crown. It was held on May 18, 2019, at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. The Preakness is a Grade I stakes race for three-year-old Thoroughbreds at a distance of miles (1.9 km) with a record high purse of $1,650,000. The race was broadcast on NBC from 5:00 pm to 7:15 pm EDT with coverage of the undercard on NBCSN starting at 2:30 pm. The race was won by War of Will, who had finished seventh in the Kentucky Derby. The Maryland Jockey Club reported a total attendance of 131,256, the second highest attendance for American thoroughbred racing events in North America during 2019.\nField.\nThe Preakness traditionally features the winner of the Kentucky Derby competing against other runners from that race as well as some \"new shooters\" – horses that either bypassed the Derby or did not qualify. However, Country House – the winner of the 2019 Kentucky Derby (by disqualification) – was withdrawn from consideration for the Preakness on May 7 when his trainer detected a virus; this marked the first time the Kentucky Derby winner did not race in the Preakness Stakes since 1996. Due to his absence, there was no possibility of a Triple Crown winner for 2019. The field also did not include Maximum Security, who crossed the finish line first in the Kentucky Derby but was disqualified for impeding other horses. His owner indicated that without a chance of winning the Triple Crown, he felt that the two week gap between the Derby and Preakness was too short. In addition, Code of Honor and Tacitus, respectively the second- and third-place finishers in the Derby, skipped the Preakness. This meant that for the first time since 1951, the Preakness was missing the first four horses to cross the finish line in the Derby.\nIn their absence, thirteen horses were entered in the Preakness in what was considered a wide-open race. Contenders included:\nAfter the post position draw on May 15, Improbable was made the 5-2 morning-line favorite after also being the favorite in the Kentucky Derby.\nRace description.\nAt the start, Bodexpress dislodged his jockey, John R. Velazquez, who was not injured. Warrior's Charge set the pace, followed by Market King, Anothertwistafate, and War of Will. Warrior's Charge had the lead through three-quarters of a mile, then started to fade at the top of the stretch. War of Will, on the rail, then took the lead, winning by lengths. Everfast came from 11th place to finish in second by a nose, edging out Owendale who came from ninth to finish in third. Warrior's Charge finished fourth. Improbable, the favorite, finished sixth.\nBodexpress, who ran the entire course without his rider—officially a \"did not finish\"—captured public attention, with his name trending on Twitter. He was finally caught and brought under control by an outrider after the race.\nRecords.\nAlthough the attendance was 2.4% less than 2018, wagering of $99,852,653 on the Preakness fourteen race card set a new record.\nResults.\n Bodexpress dislodged his jockey at the start.\nTimes: mile – 0:22.50; mile – 0:46.16; mile – 1:10.56; mile – 1:35.48; final – 1:54.34.&lt;br&gt;\nSplits for each quarter-mile: (:23.66) (:24.40) (:24.23) (:24.92) (:18.86 for final )\nReference: Equibase Chart\nPayout.\nThe 144th Preakness payout schedule"

        "text": "The 2019–20 Gallagher Premiership was the 33rd season of the top flight English domestic rugby union competition and the second one to be sponsored by Gallagher. The reigning champions entering the season were Saracens, who had claimed their fifth title after defeating Exeter Chiefs in the 2019 final. London Irish had been promoted as champions from the 2018–19 RFU Championship at the first attempt.\nThe competition was broadcast by BT Sport for the seventh successive season and with five games also simulcast free-to-air on Channel 5. Highlights of each weekend's games were shown on Channel 5 with extended highlights on BT Sport.\nSummary.\nExeter Chiefs won their second title after defeating Wasps in the final at Twickenham having also topped the regular season table. Saracens were automatically relegated after having failed to comply with prior years salary cap restrictions and were deducted a total of 105 points across two separate judgements. It was the second time that Saracens have been relegated from the top flight since the leagues began and the first time since the 1992–93 Premiership Rugby season.\nDue to changes to the global rugby calendar and the COVID-19 pandemic, this season started and finished later than previous seasons and including the Premiership Rugby Cup, ran for 58 weeks in total.\nOn 5 November 2019, Premiership Rugby announced that Saracens would be deducted 35 points in the 2019–20 season and fined £5.3 million due to undisclosed payments to players in previous seasons. Saracens initially said they would appeal the ruling, but on 18 November announced that they accepted the punishments, with the deduction leaving them 26 points adrift at the bottom of the table. After further failure to comply with the salary cap, Saracens were announced to be automatically relegated at the end of the season on 18 January 2020 despite relegation not being an available sanction in the salary cap regulations. On 28 January 2020 this was confirmed with the application of a further 70 point deduction.\nOn 16 March 2020, the league was suspended for an initial five week period due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Resumption was originally scheduled for the weekend of 24/25/26 April but was later postponed indefinitely. The restart eventually took place on 14 August, with all games played behind closed doors and broadcast live on BT Sport. Channel 5 also broadcast 5 matches.\nTeams.\nTwelve teams compete in the league – the top eleven teams from the previous season and London Irish who were promoted from the 2018–19 RFU Championship after a top flight absence of one year. They replaced Newcastle Falcons who were relegated after six years in the top flight.\nPreseason.\nThe 2019 edition of the Premiership Rugby Sevens Series was held at Franklin's Gardens on 13 and 14 September 2019. For the third successive year all twelve Premiership teams would feature in one venue over two days. Teams would be split into four pools of three which played each other once in a round-robin basis with the tournament splitting into Cup and Plate competitions on the second day.\nIn a repeat of the 2018 final, Saracens beat Wasps 35–19 to win the 2019 Premiership Sevens Cup. Gloucester beat Sale Sharks to win the Plate. It was the third successive year Wasps had made the cup final of the competition.\nFixtures.\nFixtures for the season were announced by Premiership Rugby on 10 July 2019. Due to the Rugby World Cup, the first round of matches commenced during the fifth week of the season, following four rounds of the Premiership Cup. The London Double Header does not feature after being discontinued last year.\nHighlights of the season included:\nAll fixtures are subject to change.\nRegular season.\nRound 13.\n\"Following round 13, the league was suspended until 14 August due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England.\"\nPlay-offs.\nAs in previous seasons, the top four teams in the Premiership table, following the conclusion of the regular season, contest the play-off semi-finals in a 1st vs 4th and 2nd vs 3rd format, with the higher ranking team having home advantage. The two winners of the semi-finals then meet in the Premiership Final at Twickenham on 24 October 2020.\nLeading scorers.\nNote: Flags indicate national union as has been defined under WR eligibility rules.

        "title": "Ocean Rowing Society International",
        "text": "Ocean Rowing Society International (ORSI) (prior to 2006 known as ORS), is the governing body for international ocean rowing and official adjudicator of ocean rowing records for Guinness World Records. ORSI was founded in 1983 in California by ocean rower Peter Bird and Kenneth F.Crutchlow FRGS. Current coordinators of ORSI are Tatiana Rezvaya-Crutchlow and Chris Martin, and Fiann Paul.\nHistory.\nThe Ocean Rowing Society (from 2006 – International) was founded in 1983 by Kenneth Frank Crutchlow, with support of an ocean rower Peter Bird. The reason, that urged them to do it, was a letter from a French journalist, asking if there existed a list of British ocean rowers. He was writing about the row of French Gerard d'Aboville and wondered how to compare it to the achievements of the other ocean rowers. The main goal of the Society was and still is to keep record of all attempts to row across the oceans.\nIn 1983, after almost 90 years since the first ocean row in history, there had been only 32 attempts to row an ocean, and only 14 of them had been successful. The Ocean Rowing Society completed full and accurate information about all and each of them, to verify and to classify every row in the pre-Internet era. And since then, ORS has been the only body that keeps records of all events in the field of ocean rowing activity. The Ocean Rowing Society Int. is an official adjudicator of ocean rowing records for the Guinness World Records.\nD. H. Clarke from Guinness World Records in 1964 pioneered recording of ocean rows. He handed over to Kenneth Crutchlow all his notes that laid the basis for the statistics. And ocean rowers Geoff Allum and Mike Nestor, who provided ORS with their records and numerous cuttings from press articles, and helped with the compiling of the first list of the statistics. In 2000 Tom Lynch, an American Director of ORS, handed over the maintenance of the website to Ukrainian Theodore Rezvoy, who has designed website's current interface and created logo of ORS, placing there a saying in Latin. It expresses the inner motto of this extreme adventure: \"Nosce Te Ipsum\" – Know Thyself. \"Know yourself, test yourself, challenge yourself and succeed – the greatest victory for an individual, that's what all this is about.\"\nIn 2001 Tatiana Rezvaya-Crutchlow, became and still is the Editor-in-Chief of the ORS website. She is in charge of maintaining and updating the general statistics, as well as compiling its various options, selected by the aspect of the route, category, class, age, gender, country, duration, etc. In 1980 Kenneth for the first time used ARGOS satellite beacons to track the row of Peter Bird across the Pacific Ocean from Russian Far East to San Francisco; and hence, after launching the website, ORS became the first to start monitoring and tracking rowers at sea, listing positions, plotting charts and posting them – along with the press articles, news and other information about and from rowers at sea, – making it available to public.\nORS has coordinated dozens of rows of individuals and in 2004 organized the first race with Solos and Four entrees (besides traditional Teams of Two – that had been the only class of entrees in races 1997, 2001 and 2003). It was then, that ORS introduced a convenient way of tracking numerous boats on one chart on the webpage, by marking them as dots of different colors – the way adopted later by organizers of other races. ORS has been one of the first contacts in the list of the Coast Guards, when it goes about rescue at sea of independent rowers. It assists by providing/confirming the necessary data, positions, contacts, etc. Kenneth F.Crutchlow was the first to organize a resupply of an ocean rower on route (Peter Bird, Pacific Ocean 1983) and then organized and participated in several resupplies of rowers and teams at sea – sailing and flying, or coordinating a meeting with a vessel or even another rowboat. ORSI organized the first meeting of entries in the 1997 race and in 2002 – meeting with all women-ocean rowers, at the Royal Geographical Society in London. It also organized lunches for ocean rowers with representatives of Guinness World Records on the occasions of awarding Guinness certificates to ocean rowers.\nIn 2000 ORS formed a committee of ocean rowers who prepared \"guidelines\" for those who might themselves want to accept the Challenge of an Ocean Row. There was established a record \"Blue Riband Trophy of Ocean Rowing\", to be presented to the holders of the record \"The fastest row across the Atlantic East to West along the \"Trade Winds I\", – the most popular and rowed route of all in the world oceans. In 2017 Blue Riband Trophy was divided into two classes: classic and open. In 2003 ORS came up with an idea of organizing free seminars, where ocean rowers, coast guard helicopter pilots, psychologists, specialists in survival at sea shared their experience with those who were planning or about to go to sea. ORS sees as its task to keep alive and honor names of the past ocean rowers. A number of ocean rowboats related to the pioneers of ocean rowing have been saved from destruction, exhibited at several boat shows and finally presented to the relevant museums and organizations. In 2006 ORS became ORSI.\nIn 2021 Fiann Paul developed a geodatabase that documents and processes the entire history of human-power ocean-exploration, dubbed by Guinness World Records “The first real adventure database”. This database became the new ORSI website.\nCoordinators.\nORSI is led by coordinators. The following list gives main coordinators since 1983:"

        "text": "Michael James Busch (born November 9, 1997) is an American professional baseball infielder for the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball (MLB).

        "title": "1969–70 Cornell Big Red men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1969–70 Cornell Big Red men's ice hockey team represented Cornell University in college ice hockey. In its 7th year under head coach Ned Harkness the team compiled a 29–0–0 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the fourth consecutive year. The Big Red defeated Clarkson 6–4 in the championship game at the Jack Shea Arena in Lake Placid, New York, to become the first and only (as of 2024) undefeated and untied national champion in college ice hockey history.\nSeason.\nEarly season.\nAfter losing the last players from their first championship team, including the best player in program history, Ken Dryden, Cornell was expected to still field a strong team but perhaps not be as good as last year's NCAA runner-up team. After only appearing in spot duty the year before, junior Brian Cropper got his opportunity to start in goal for the Big Red and was eased into the role with Cornell's dominating performance in their opener over . Senior captain Dick Bertrand led the way with a hat-trick while the team scored 4 power play goals in the 8–2 rout. A few days later Cornell welcomed to the Lynah Rink and while the Big Red were the better team the two fought through a sloppy and contentious affair. The home team built a 3–0 lead in the first but just before the period ended the Gryphons got their first marker and went into the locker room with some confidence. The teams then played the next 34 minutes without a goal scored but when John Hughes notched Cornell's fourth goal with just over 6 minutes to play the game was effectively over.\nA few days later Cornell opened its ECAC Hockey schedule against Rensselaer, the only eastern team that had beaten the Big Red during the last season. The upper classmen got a measure of revenge with an 8–2 drubbing of the Engineers in the penalty-filled game. Rensselaer managed their two goals on the power play to Cornell's 3, but it was at even strength where Cornell showed its strength. Cropper was particularly good in net while Dan Lodboa and Kevin Pettit each scored twice.\nCornell hit the road for the first time in their next game against Brown, who gave the Big Red their first big test of the season. Cornell scored the first two goals of the contest before the Bears came roaring back to take a 4–3 lead in the third period. During the game both Steve Giuliani and Ron Simpson were injured, leaving Cornell down two defensemen and giving Brown its chance to pounce on the remaining tired blueline. Despite the hard checking in the game Brown was only penalized once but it came when the team was up in the third and on the ensuing power play Brian McCutcheon was able to tie the game. The match went into overtime, but not before Cropper was required to stop an excellent scoring chance with just 6 seconds remaining in regulation. The overtime session lasted only 34 seconds and was ended by Lodboa after intercepting a pass and firing a slap shot past Brown netminder Don McGinnis. After the game Giuliani was diagnosed with a sprained back and was expected to be out for several weeks while Simpson had to have a knee operation to repair torn ligaments missed a significant portion of the season.\nThe team's next game was in Boston in front of a half-capacity crowd against Boston University. Still reeling from losing two defenders, Cornell was uncharacteristically sluggish in the opening frame and allowed BU to gain a 1–0 advantage after 20 minutes. The score could have been much worse were it not for Brian Cropper stopping three Terrier breakaways in the period. Giuliani fought through the pain of his bad back but remained a weak spot on Cornell's defense throughout the game. In the second period Cornell began showing their true colors and rallied with back-to-back unassisted goals to take their first lead. BU tied the game shortly thereafter but just past the half-way point of the second Cornell regained their lead with a Bob Aitchison tally followed by a second goal from the junior to give the Big Red a 2-goal advantage. The third period saw a withering attack from the Terries and they were able to get their third of the night past Cropper in the eighth minute but after cutting the lead to 1 BU couldn't get the equalizer. After taking bad penalty near the end of the frame Cornell's power play came through and the team regained the 2-goal edge that remained for the rest of the match.\nCornell returned home to face Yale that weekend. The relatively weak Bulldog team was unable to muster much of a challenge to the Big Red and the home team skated to an 8–1 victory. Four days later the Big Red were in Canton to take on for the final game before the holiday tournaments. The Larries were barely able to conjure a threat to Cornell, getting only 14 shots on net in the Cropper's first shutout win of the season. Lodboa continued his torrid pace with two more goals and the team went into the break with a 7–0 record.\nHoliday season.\nIn the rematch with RPI Cornell wasn't about to let the Engineers off the mat. Cornell scored twice before the three minute mark and added another two before the first period was over. In the third the team notch three more power play goals and added two more tallied in the third to earn their largest win of the season to that point. Cropper earned his second consecutive shutout while Hughes and McCutcheon each scored twice in the contest. The following night Cornell's shutout streak ended at 14:31 of the first period but the Big Red remained dominant in their 7–2 victory with Bertrand's hat-trick leading Cornell to its fifth consecutive ECAC winter tournament championship.\nAfter the first of the year the team played their second holiday tournament, this time headlining the Syracuse Invitational. Cornell opened against BU and this time the Big Red defense was much more stingy, keeping the Terriers off of the score sheet until the later half of the third period. Boston University provided an equally challenging effort but Cornell was able to score once in each of the first two periods and then responded to BU's power play goal with two markers in less than two minutes to win the game 4–1. In the championship match against Colgate the Big Red weren't as overpowering as they typically were but two power play goals in 10 seconds during the middle frame allowed Cornell to hold onto its lead despite a relatively poor performance from Brian Cropper. The superlative effort from Lodboa in both tournaments earned him both MVPs, the only defenseman to capture two such in-season awards.\nClose calls and blowouts.\nThe first-place Big Red picked up their defensive effort after the tournament by limiting Harvard to a single goal on 26 shots in their next game. After their 12th win of the season, Cornell took two weeks off before their next game and the offense was predictably rusty. The Big Red opened their road game against with a short handed goal but the Varsity blues tied the game before the period was out. Neither team was able to score in the second, despite a 19-shot barrage by Cornell, but Dick Bertrand was finally able to find the back of the net 75 seconds into the third. Cropper kept the door closed the rest of the way and the Big Red were able to escape with a win in their worst offensive effort of the season.\nFour days later Cornell was back in Ithaca and their offense returned in force against Princeton. Lodboa got his 4th 2-goal game of the season, giving him 12 on the year to lead the team (tied with Brian McCutcheon) while the defense as a whole only allowed 12 shots from the Tigers. One found its way past Cropper but by then the Big Red had already built a 4-goal lead. Princeton netminder Tilghman did a fantastic job stopping 53 of 60 shots, including 26 saves in the second period alone. three days later the team was in New Haven for its second game against Yale and while the score wasn't as heavily tilted in Cornell's favor the outcome was the same. Hughes contributed on each of the team's four goals, recording his first hat-trick of the season and taking back the team lead in goals (14). Despite their unblemished record there was still a sense from other programs that Cornell could be beaten and those teams would have their chance to prove just that in the final stretch of the season.\nFirst up after the six-week intercession was over was Colgate and the game turned into a special teams battle with 6 of seven goals scored on the power play, but it was Cornell's man-advantage that ruled the day. A few days later the squad played host to Brown and handily dispatched the Bears 5–1. Steve Giuliani scored his first goal of the season to cap off the match, earning a bit of revenge against the team that injured him earlier in the year. Dan Lodboa's 14th goal tied him with Hughes and McCutcheon for the team lead.\nA week later 2nd-place Boston College arrived in Ithaca and with five Big Red players suffering from the flu (including Cropper and Hughes) it appeared that Cornell may have been ripe for the taking. When BC scored less than a minute into the game many in the record home crowd were stunned but the Big Red responded to tie the game soon thereafter. The Eagles took their second lead of the game in the eighth minute of the second period and this time held the lead for three and a half minutes before the boys from Ithaca knotted the score again. The two teams combined for three goals in less than two minutes at the end of the second with Cornell coming out ahead to take a 4–3 lead into the third. From there on Cropper kept the visitors scoreless while Pettit finished off his hat-trick to lead Cornell to a close 5–3 win.\nFor their next game Cornell got a bit of a reprieve, playing the bottom-feeding Penn Quakers, and posted a new season-high in goals. The Big Red weren't too sharp in the game but the disparity in talent was on display through the game with 10 different Big Red players scoring goals en route to an 11–1 win. The game was in hand to such a degree that backup netminder Bob Rule was put in net for the final 10:10 of the third period and didn't have to make a save. Craig Brush, Doug Stewart and Ron Simpson all scored their first goals of the season.\nLeague championships.\nThe demolition of Penn apparently gave the big Red a false sense of security because in their next game at Dartmouth the Big Green were the only ones to score in the first. When Cornell did finally tie the game Dartmouth responded with their second just 50 seconds later. The Big Green held the lead well into the third and, just when it was looking like Cornell's win streak would end at 19, senior Garth Ryan tied the game with under 10 minutes to play. The Cornell assault continued and yielded a third goal just under three minutes later from Pettit. Cropper held the fort and allowed the Big Red to escape back to New York with a 3–2 win.\nAfter the close call with losing, Cornell made sure to stay as far away from the loss column as they could. Their next game against Harvard saw an even first period end 2–2 before a 6-goal deluge in the second allowed the Big Red to skate away with a 9–3 victory. The scoring was led by hat-tricks from Dan Lodboa (his first) and Larry Fullan while the win sealed the Ivy League crown for Cornell. Three nights later Ned Harkness benched Kevin Pettit against visiting Pennsylvania, placing Bill Duthie on the top line. The change didn't make much difference at the start of the game when Cornell scored the first two goals, but after Penn got two of their own in less than two minutes the Lynah crowd grew nervous. A power play goal from Brian McCutcheon put Cornell back on top to end the period but the heroics from opposing goalie John Marks in the second allowed Penn to again tie the game with the only goal in the middle frame. With Cropper having one of his poorest performances on the season McCutcheon answered the bell and scored twice before a minute had elapsed in the third and a 31-shot bombardment of the Quaker net yielded a further two goals and give Cornell their 22nd win of the season, guaranteeing them the ECAC title with two games to play.\nWith only their undefeated streak to occupy their thoughts the Big Red welcomed Dartmouth for a rematch of their near loss. With the home crowd cheering them on, Cornell dismantled the Big Green, scoring 14 times and allowing none in response. Kevin Pettit returned in force, recording a hat-trick and adding two assists but it was third-liner Bob Aitchison who led the way with four goals and an assist, doubling his goal total for the season. Seventeen different players scored a point in the game and with the score 9–0 after the second period, Bob Rule got to play the entire third period in net and made 8 saves in total. Cornell ended their regular season three days later at Princeton and continued their torrid scoring pace, beating the tigers 11–5. Rule got his turn to start the third for a second straight game with the team up 8–1, but Cropper was back in goal after Rule allowed three goals in 7:25, the Tigers Tilghman was once again stellar in stopping 54 Big Red shots but a McCutcheon hat-trick was just the tip of the Cornell iceberg.\nECAC Tournament.\nCornell finished with only the second undefeated regular season for a qualifying team (Clarkson in 1956) but their biggest test still lay ahead. The Big Red received the top seed in the ECAC and were slated to play St. Lawrence in the conference quarterfinals. The selection of the Saints was a surprise as they had finished below Colgate in the standings and had a worse overall record (11–14 compared to 14–7–3). In any case Cornell ran over the Larries, scoring twice in each period and holding St. Lawrence scoreless until just under three minutes remained despite several questionable hits by SLU. In winning the game Cornell tied the NCAA record with 25 consecutive wins (held by the previous year's Big Red team) as well as breaking the power play goals record with their 39th of the season. Dan Lodboa set all-time records for goals by defenseman in both a season (20) and a career (48) and the most assists in a season (34). Larry Fullan set a new record for assists by a sophomore with 30.\nCornell headed to Boston for the semifinal against Harvard and, despite the earlier wins against the Crimson, the Big Red had their hands full. Cornell scored first on the power play but the Crimson offence stormed back and beat Brian Cropper three times in just over four minutes of play to take a 3–1 lead early in the second. Playing from 2 goals behind for the first time all season, Cornell buckled down defensively and held Harvard back while they slowly chipped away at the lead and tied the game before the period was over. With the crisis over Cornell charged out of the gate in the third, scoring twice before 8 minutes had elapsed but in less than three and a half minutes Harvard had tied the game at 5-all. The Crimson, however, took a penalty shortly after their fifth goal and that allowed Larry Fullan to score the deciding marker and send the Big Red to the title game.\nClarkson, the number 2 team in the conference, was the only thing left standing in the way of Cornell winning their fourth consecutive conference championship. In the first meeting between the teams for the season Clarkson was the squad that got the quick start, scoring just over a minute into the contest. Cornell responded 39 seconds later but it quickly became apparent that opposing goalie Bruce Bullock would be tough to beat. Clarkson used their netminder's strong performance to regain the lead on a power play goal before the first period had ended and held onto their advantage until the second half of the game when Ed Ambis tied the game. The goal was Ambis' first of the season and the first by an American Cornell player in over two years. The Cornell attack picked up its intensity in the third period, outshooting Clarkson 24 to 5 but Bullock turned away puck after puck until just 14 seconds remained in regulation when John Hughes fired a puck between Bullock's legs to win the game.\nNCAA tournament.\nCornell Arrived in Lake Placid with two goals in mind; win the national title and finish with an unblemished record. Both could be accomplished only by winning two games in the NCAA tournament. The Big Red received the top overall seed, an obvious choice as they were (and remain as of 2019) the only team to reach the tournament without a loss. In the Semifinal they were pitted against a surprise entry, Wisconsin, who had defeated 2-time defending national champion Denver in the WCHA Tournament. Cornell was once more faced with a stellar performance by an opposing goalie, this time Wayne Thomas held the Big Red off of the scoresheet for 45 minutes before the relentless attack finally broke through. Wisconsin scored in the first to gain an early lead and then tried to hold back the much faster eastern team. Wisconsin was so dominated in the game that they could only muster 4 shots in the final 40 minutes but the superb play of Thomas kept the Badgers in the game until the very end. Cornell's two third-period goals gave them a narrow margin of victory but it was enough to send the Big Red into the championship game.\nCornell met Clarkson for a rematch of the ECAC championship and the two heavyweights battled through one of the most memorable game in tournament history. Clarkson scored just 20 seconds into the game, making it the fourth consecutive game that Cornell had to play from behind. Larry Fullan tied the game four minutes later and then a Garth Ryan gave the Big Red their first lead of the night. The Golden Knights were able to tie the game before the period ended and while Bullock wasn't as impressive as he had been in the ECAC tournament, Brian Cropper wasn't playing well and the two team set about trying to outscore one another. Clarkson got their second lead early in the second and it took almost ten minutes for Cornell to retie the contest. Clarkson had two separate power plays before the end of the frame but Cornell's penalty killers performed beautifully and kept the score knotted at three. In the third period Clarkson's Steve Warr took a tripping penalty that allowed Cornell to pull ahead with a power play goal from Dan Lodboa. A minute later Cornell's Westner was sent to the box and followed soon after by Gordon Lowe to give Clarkson a 5-on-3 man advantage. Rather than see Clarkson capitalize on their opportunity, the crowd got to witness Lodboa skate from end to end through the entire Clarkson team and score one of the most spectacular goals in NCAA history. The goal, which would ultimately prove to be the game-winner, was Lodboa's fourth shorthanded tally of the year, a new NCAA record, and the only 3-on-5 goal in any championship game. Just over five minutes later, with a player from each side in the box, Lodboa got his third goal of the night to complete a hat-trick, the first natural hat-trick in championship game history and the only ever hat-trick by a defenseman. Clarkson was able to close the gap slightly 72 seconds later but Cropper and the defense turned the rest aside and Cornell won their second NCAA title.\nLodboa was named as the unanimous Tournament MOP and was named to the All-Tournament Team with John Hughes and Steve Giuliani. Lodboa was the second defensemen (1952) to lead a championship team in scoring, a feat that has only been accomplished twice more (1977 and 2018) as of 2019. Lodboa's 61 points placed him 5th in the nation in scoring. Despite Cornell's #1 defense and utterly dominating offense, only Lodboa was named to the AHCA All-American East Team while he and Cropper were on the All-ECAC Hockey First Team. John Hughes was the lone Cornellian on the conference second team while none of the three individual conference awards went to the Big Red.\nIn the years since, only Maine in 1993 had much of a chance to accomplish a similar feat to Cornell's undefeated national champion but the Black Bears lost their lone game in February to preserve the 1970 Big Red squad as a unique champion.\nSchedule.\nThe team's schedule was as follows:\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRoster and scoring statistics.\nThe team roster and scoring statistics were as follows:"

The series was the conclusion of the 2019 Overwatch League playoffs and was played between the Vancouver Titans and San Francisco Shock at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nVancouver qualified for the season playoffs as the top seed and defeated the Seoul Dynasty, Los Angeles Gladiators, and New York Excelsior all in the upper bracket of the playoffs. San Francisco qualified as the third seed and was defeated in the first round by the Atlanta Reign but went on to defeat the defending champions London Spitfire, Los Angeles Gladiators, Hangzhou Spark, and New York Excelsior in the lower bracket.\nThe Shock swept the Titans, 4–0, in the Grand Finals to win their first OWL championship.\nRoad to the Grand Finals.\nThe Grand Finals are the post-season championship series of the Overwatch League (OWL), a professional international esports league; the teams of the Grand Finals compete for a $1.7 million prize pool, where the winners receive $1.1 million. The 2019 season was the second in OWL history and consisted of twenty teams in two divisions. Each team played 28 matches throughout the regular season. The playoffs were contested by eight teams – the two teams with the best regular season record in each division, the following four teams with the best regular season record, regardless of division, and the top two teams from the play-in tournament.\nThe finalists, Vancouver and San Francisco, had the top two 2019 regular season records at and , respectively. The Titans claimed the top seed of the season playoffs as the Pacific Division champions, while the Shock were awarded the third seed, behind the Atlantic Division champions New York Excelsior. The two teams faced each other four times throughout the 2019 season – in the Stage 1 and 2 Finals and twice in the regular season. The teams split their two matches in the regular season, Vancouver won the Stage 1 title, and San Francisco won the Stage 2 title; additionally, the teams have an even 11–11 map record against the other in those four matches. The defending OWL champions, London Spitfire, were eliminated in the first round of the losers bracket of the playoffs, while the runners-up, Philadelphia Fusion, failed to qualify for the 2019 playoffs after being eliminated in the play-in tournament.\nVancouver Titans.\nThe Titans entered the 2019 season as one of eight expansion teams with a roster consisting primarily of the members of Korean Contenders team RunAway.\nVancouver started the season with a 4–0 sweep over the Shanghai Dragons. The team ended Stage 1 with a perfect 7–0 record and went on to win the Stage 1 Finals against the Shock. The Titans posted another perfect 7–0 record in Stage 2; however, they lost in the Stage 2 Finals against the Shock, which ended their Overwatch League record 19-game win streak (including playoffs). The team continued their regular season dominance by winning an Overwatch League record 19 consecutive games that was not snapped until on June 23, when the Los Angeles Valiant defeated the Titans. While they qualified for the Stage 3 playoffs, Vancouver was defeated by the Shanghai Dragons in the semifinals round. The Titans lost two more times in the regular season, against the Washington Justice and San Francisco Shock, to end the regular season with a league-best 25–3 record and the top seed in the season playoffs. Kim \"Haksal\" Hyo-jong and Lee \"Twilight\" Ju-seok were awarded the Role Star commendation for DPS and support, respectively; Haksal was also named the OWL Rookie of the year. Twilight and tank Choi \"Jjanu\" Hyeon-woo were finalists for the league's most valuable player award, but the Shock's Jay \"sinatraa\" Won won the award.\nVancouver faced the eighth-seeded Seoul Dynasty in the first round of the playoffs, winning 4–2 after claiming three straight map victories. Advancing to the first round of the winners bracket, the team took down the fifth-seeded Los Angeles Gladiators by a 4–2 score. In the Winners' Finals, Vancouver faced the New York Excelsior; the match went to seven maps, as the two teams traded map wins throughout. The Titans came out on top with a 4–3 victory to advance to the Grand Finals.\nSan Francisco Shock.\nSan Francisco entered the league in 2018 as one of the twelve founding franchises. Looking to qualify for their first stage or season playoffs, the team made several roster additions in the preceding offseason of the 2019 season, including acquiring main tank Yoo \"Smurf\" Myeong-hwan from the Houston Outlaws, promoting Kim \"Rascal\" Dong-jun from their academy team NRG Esports, signing Park \"Viol2t\" Min-ki from Korean Overwatch Contenders team O2 Ardeont, and acquiring DPS Kwon \"Striker\" Nam-joo from the Boston Uprising.\nThe Shock's first match of the 2019 regular season resulted in a 4–0 sweep over the Dallas Fuel. The team followed the win by splitting the next six matches to finish Stage 1 with a 4–3 record and the sixth seed in the Stage 1 Playoffs. The team made it to the Stage 1 Finals, but they fell to the Titans. San Francisco hit their stride in Stage 2, as the team completed the \"perfect stage\" with a 7–0 record and 28–0 map record. Qualified as the top seed in the Stage 2 Playoffs, the Shock defeated the Titans in the Stage 2 Finals. San Francisco dropped two matches in Stage 3, against the Houston Outlaws and Chengdu Hunters, and fell to the Shanghai Dragons in the Stage 3 Finals. The team finished the regular season with seven straight wins to post a 23–5 record, the second best in the league, and the third seed in the season playoffs. Jay \"Sinatraa\" Won, Matthew \"super\" DeLisi, Choi \"ChoiHyoBin\" Hyo-bin, and Grant \"Moth\" Espe were awarded the Role Star commendation for DPS, tank, tank, and support, respectively. Both Sinatraa and super were nominated for the league's most valuable player award, which Sinatraa won for his ability to flex onto a multitude of different heroes and hold his own as a championship team member.\nSan Francisco faced the sixth-seeded Atlanta Reign in the first round of the season playoffs, but the team fell in a heartbreaking 3–4 loss to drop to the losers bracket. The Shock responded to the loss by pulling off a dominant run in losers bracket; the team swept the London Spitfire in the first round, the Los Angeles Gladiators in the second round, the Hangzhou Spark in the third round, and the New York Excelsior in the losers finals to secure a spot in the Grand Finals.\nVenue and ticketing.\nThe Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia was announced as the 2019 OWL Grand Finals host venue on May 8, 2019. Overwatch League commissioner Nate Nanzer noted that the league chose Philadelphia because it is a \"legendary sports town with amazing fans.\" Originally called Spectrum II, Wells Fargo Center opened in 1996 at a cost of $210 million and has a seating capacity of 21,000. It is the home arena of the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL), the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA), the Philadelphia Soul of the Arena Football League (AFL) and the Philadelphia Wings of the National Lacrosse League (NLL). The arena has been the site of a number of other notable events, including the 1997 and 2010 Stanley Cup Finals, the 2001 NBA Finals, various collegiate events for the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the 2000 Republican National Convention, the 2016 Democratic National Convention, and multiple concerts and WWE events.\nTicket sales for the finals, including upgrade packages which feature early entry, Overwatch League merchandise, free parking, and access to an Overwatch meet-and-greet available to additional cost, began on June 7, 2019. The approximately 12,000-seat venue was sold out for the final event.\nBroadcast and viewership.\nThe Grand Finals were live-streamed on Twitch in 190 countries, and were also available to stream on the ESPN app and the Overwatch League's website and app. The match was broadcast in the United States on ABC; the finals were also available in the following countries via the following platforms:\nThe estimated viewership across television and streaming drew about 1.12 million viewers per minute, a 16% increase over the 2018 Grand Finals.\nEntertainment.\nSeveral artists and DJs performed prior or during the Grand Finals match. EDM artist Martin Garrix, with guests Matt Ox and PAZ, headlined an outdoor concert at the Wells Fargo Center complex the day prior to the finals. DJ Ghost performed in the parking lot of the Wells Fargo Center the morning of the Finals. Musician, music journalist, and Philadelphia native Questlove performed during tournament breaks.\nOpening ceremony.\nOn September 12, the OWL announced that record producer, DJ, and songwriter Zedd would perform during the Grand Finals Opening Ceremony. A short clip of a new unreleased pink and blue Widowmaker skin featuring the Zedd logo was aired at the beginning of the performance. The show featured mixes of \"Stay The Night\", \"Clarity\", \"Stay\", \"The Middle\", and a special guest performance by R&amp;B singer Kehlani performing \"Good Thing\". The show was well received by fans – a stark contrast to the 2018 Opening Ceremony performance by DJ Khaled during the 2018 Grand Finals.\nMatch summary.\nThe Grand Finals were to be played as a first-to-four series of matches. Vancouver, as the higher seed entering the match, had the selection of which specific map was to be played from the available pool in the first round. Each subsequent map choice was given to the losing team from the previous map, while the winning team from the previous match chose whether they would like to attack or defend first, if applicable.\nMap 1: Lijiang Tower.\nAs the higher seed in the matchup, the Titans selected control map Lijiang Tower – a map that Vancouver has been historically good on – to open the match. The Shock came out strong and took first control of the point. Stellar teamwork and effective ultimate management kept San Francisco rolling throughout the round, but the Titan's eventually took control of the point after the Shock had 93% of the capture. However, in the next team fight, the Shock rolled through the Titans defenses to take back control and win the round.\nIn round two, the Titans came out on top of the first team fight and took first control. Vancouver held the point throughout multiple team fights, highlighted by an effective ultimate combination between Choi \"JJANU\" Hyeon-woo on Sigma and Kim \"Haksal\" Hyo-jong on Doomfist. After claiming 65% of the point, the Titans finally lost control. The two teams traded point captures throughout the remainder of the round; the Shock eventually sealed a win in the second round, largely due Shock Jay \"sinatraa\" Won's dominant play as Doomfist.\nMap 2: Eichenwalde.\nFor the hybrid map, Vancouver selected Eichenwalde; the Shock subbed out damage players sinatraa and Kwon \"Striker\" Nam-joo for Park \"Architect\" Min-ho and Kim \"Rascal\" Dong-jun to play as a Bastion/Mei combo. San Francisco attacked first and were able to capture the first point on their first attempt. As the map moved to the escort potion, the Shock did not lose a team fight as they captured the second point with over four minutes in the time bank. As the payload was escorted though the final phase of the map, Rascal used Mei's ice walls helping to both protect and elevate Architect's Bastion to give him high ground. Notably, Architect had managed to get Bastion up onto one of the chandeliers that hung near the end of the map and, subsequently, prevented the Titans from challenging the final capture from this tactical position. The Shock finished the map with 2:49 in the time bank.\nFor their defense, the Shock opted to defend with Rascal on Pharah, while Architect remained on Bastion. The Titans responded well, and through a lengthy team fight, they were able to capture the first point and began escorting the payload. Vancouver was met early in the escort phase, but Seo \"SeoMinSoo\" Min-soo on Reaper dispatched the Shock. The team's momentum continued throughout the second phase of the map, as the Titan captured the second point without losing a team fight. The Shock were able to stop the Titans in the first fight of the third phase, but the Titans came back in full force and finished the map with 2:47 in their time bank.\nAs both teams completed the map, the map went to overtime rounds; Vancouver attacked first. The Titans were unable to capture any progress on the point after a sloppy first team fight, but a much stronger second attack nearly secured them the first point. However, a well-timed Rocket Barrage by Rascal's Pharah ended the Titans attack with 55.4% of progress on the first point. On San Francisco's attack, they were held up under the choke point for an extended amount of time, but the team was able to touch the capture area as time ran out to force an overtime timer; a clutch ultimate from Choi \"ChoiHyoBin\" Hyo-bin on Sigma led to the Shock closing out the map with a win.\nMap 3: Temple of Anubis.\nComing out of halftime, the Titan's chose assault map Temple of Anubis for the match's third map; the Shock brought sinatraa and Striker back in for Rascal and Architect. The Titans attacked first and were able to capture the first point on their first attempt. After a few failed attempts, the Titans finally broke through the Shock's second point defenses and, after a lengthy stagger delay from the Shock, finished the map with 1:34 remaining.\nOn defense, the Titans focused on shutting down sinatraa's Doomfist, and found some success, as they were able to hold of the Shock's first and second attacks. However, the Shock finally broke through the Titan defense as the timer ran out and captured the first point in overtime. San Francisco carried that momentum into the second point and won the first team fight to finish the map with 2:12 in their time bank.\nThe Titans had the first attack in overtime rounds; after getting shut down multiple times, Haksal's Doomfist created an opening for the Titans to take the first point with less than 15 second remaining. With only time for one more attack, the Titan's failed to capture the second point. The Shock responded on their attack by taking the first point on their first attempt. Striker found an early pick as the Shock attacked the second point, but Vancouver was able to recover and held back the Shock. San Francisco responded by taking down Vancouver in the next team fight and took their third map win.\nMap 4: Watchpoint: Gibraltar.\nWith the Shock at match point, Vancouver chose to take the match to escort map . The Shock once again subbed out sinatraa and Striker for Rascal and Architect. Defending first, Vancouver overcame the Bastion/Mei composition run by San Francisco in the first team fight right at the beginning of the map; however, the Shock struck back by winning the following team fight with 2:20 remaining. The team carried that momentum throughout the first phase of the map and to reach the first checkpoint. The Shock found little resistance in the second phase of the map; a great Gravitic Flux from ChoiHyoBin's Sigma took the Shock to the second checkpoint. With over four minutes remaining, the Shock began the third phase of the map. A well-timed Death Blossom from SeoMinSoo's Reaper momentarily held the Shock from completing the map, but San Francisco came right back and completed the map with 1:52 remaining.\nVancouver struggled to push the payload to the first checkpoint on their attack, largely due to Rascal's strong Pharah performance. With under 30 second left in the map, JJANU found a couple of eliminations that propelled the Titans to the first checkpoint. Vancouver found an easier, albeit still difficult, time pushing the payload to the second checkpoint. Beginning with JJANU getting picked by being out of position, the Titans could not find a footing in the final phase of the map. With Architect as Bastion on the high ground defending the final checkpoint of the map, the Shock held the Titans from completing the map and claimed a 4–0 sweep."

It was the 44th consecutive year that the World Snooker Championship was held at the Crucible. The final ranking event of the 2019–20 snooker season, the tournament was originally scheduled to take place from 18 April to 4 May 2020, but both the qualifying stage and the main rounds were postponed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The event was one of the first to allow live audiences since the onset of the pandemic, but on the first day it was announced that the event would be played behind closed doors for subsequent days. A limited number of spectators were allowed in for the final two days of the championship.\nThe tournament was organised by the World Snooker Tour, a subsidiary of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, and was broadcast by the BBC, Eurosport and Matchroom Sport. The event had a total prize fund of £2,395,000, with the winner receiving £500,000. Qualifying for the tournament was due to be held between 8 and 15 April 2020 but instead took place from 21 to 28 July at the English Institute of Sport, Sheffield. There were 128 participants in the qualifying rounds, with a mix of professional and invited amateur players, 16 of whom reached the main stage of the tournament where they played the top 16 players in the snooker world rankings. The event was sponsored by sports betting company Betfred.\nJudd Trump was the defending champion, having won his maiden world title at the previous year's event, defeating John Higgins 18–9 in the final. He lost in the quarter-final stage to Kyren Wilson, falling to the Crucible curse. Ronnie O'Sullivan won his sixth world title, defeating Wilson 18–8 in the final. This was O'Sullivan's 37th ranking event win of his career, the most of any player. Higgins made a maximum break in the 12th frame of his second-round loss to Kurt Maflin. This was Higgins' tenth career maximum break and his first at the World Championship; aged 45, he became the oldest player to make a maximum in a professional competition.\nBackground.\nThe World Snooker Championship features 32 professional players competing in one-on-one snooker matches in a single-elimination format, each match played over several . The 32 players for the event are selected through a mix of the snooker world rankings and a pre-tournament qualification round. The first World Snooker Championship took place in 1927, with the final held at Camkin's Hall in Birmingham, England, and the title was won by Joe Davis. Since 1977, the event has been held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. , Stephen Hendry and Ronnie O'Sullivan are the event's most successful participants in the modern era, having both won the championship seven times. The 2019 championship had been won by England's Judd Trump, who defeated Scotland's John Higgins in the final 18–9 to win his first world title. The winner of the 2020 championship received £500,000, from a total prize fund of £2,395,000. The event is organised by World Snooker in partnership with the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association.\nFormat.\nThe tournament was scheduled to take place between 18 April and 4 May 2020 in Sheffield, England, but was postponed to between 31 July and 16 August as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The event featured a 32-player main draw that was contested at the Crucible Theatre, as well as a 128-player qualifying draw played at the English Institute of Sport. Qualifying was originally due to take place from 8 to 15 April but was also delayed, eventually taking place from 21 to 28 July 2020 and finishing three days prior to the start of the main draw. In May 2019, the World Snooker Tour announced the event's qualifying format would be changed from the previous year, with seeding given to players with a higher ranking, and played over four rounds instead of three. The tournament was the last of 17 ranking events in the 2019–20 season on the World Snooker Tour. This was the 44th consecutive year that the tournament had been held at the Crucible, and the 52nd successive world championship to be contested through the modern knockout format. The tournament was sponsored by sports betting company Betfred, as it had been since 2015.\nThe top 16 players in the latest 2019–20 snooker world rankings automatically qualified for the main draw as seeded players. Defending champion Judd Trump was automatically seeded first overall. The remaining 15 seeds were allocated based on the latest world rankings, released after the 2020 Tour Championship which was the penultimate event of the season. Matches in the first round of the main draw were played as the best of 19 frames, second-round matches and quarter-finals were played as the best of 25 frames, and the semi-finals were played over a maximum of 33 frames. The final was played over two days as a best-of-35-frames match.\nCoverage.\nThe tournament was broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Television and BBC Online, as well as Eurosport. Internationally, the event was broadcast by Eurosport in Europe and Australia; by Superstars Online, Zhibo.tv, Youku and CCTV in China; by NowTV in Hong Kong; and by DAZN in Canada, the United States, and Brazil. In all other countries, Matchroom Sport broadcast the main tournament, as well as the qualifying rounds, via their new online subscription service.\nThe World Snooker Championship was intended to be one of the first sporting events to allow spectators after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. A reduced audience was to be admitted to allow for social distancing. The event, along with the Glorious Goodwood Festival and two county cricket matches, was being used as a trial for live audiences by the UK Government, ahead of restrictions being lifted in October. On the first day of the event, UK prime minister Boris Johnson announced that the sporting pilots were being ended, and spectators would no longer be allowed inside the venue. The World Snooker Tour confirmed an hour later that fans would be admitted for the rest of the first day, but matches were to be played behind closed doors for the remainder of the tournament.\nDuring the semi-final stages, the UK Government announced that the previously postponed sporting event pilots would resume. This meant that the reduced capacity crowd from the start of the tournament would be allowed back for both days of the final.\nPrize fund.\nThe winner of the event received £500,000 from a total prize fund of £2,395,000. The breakdown of prize money for the event is shown below.\nTournament summary.\nQualifying stage.\nQualifying for the event was held between 21 and 28 July 2020 over four separate rounds, with 16 players progressing into the main draw.

In the final frame, McGill was snookered behind the , and conceded 35 penalty points, missing the shot on eight occasions. This was enough points for McGill to require snookers to remain in the competition. In the next shot, Wilson played a safety shot, and went allowing McGill enough points to be able to win. With the final red ball being slightly above the middle pocket, both players missed shots from the cushion, before McGill potted the red, but ran out of position. Wilson then the green, which won the match.\nThe deciding frame lasted 62 minutes and made a new record for the most combined points scored in a single frame at the Crucible, 103–83. After fluking the match winning ball, Wilson became emotional, and apologised to McGill. He stated afterwards, \"I didn't want it to end that way, I have dreamed of this situation and I didn't want to win the match on a fluke.\" McGill commented, \"I feel as if the match was stolen from me – not by Kyren [Wilson] but by the snooker gods\". After the deciding frame, 1991 champion John Parrott remarked, \"I have never, in 44 years of playing this wonderful game, seen a frame of snooker like that. It was unbelievable.\"\nThe second semi-final was between Mark Selby and Ronnie O'Sullivan. O'Sullivan won four of the first five frames with there being a lot of in the session, the balls being replaced to counteract the number of bad contacts. Selby trailed 2–5, but won the final frame of the session to trail 3–5. Seven-time champion Stephen Hendry suggested that Selby may have felt he had \"almost won\" the session after claiming the final frame and avoided been 6-2 down. Selby then won the next four frames of the match to lead 7–5, before winning two more frames to win the second session 6–2. In the final frame of the session, O'Sullivan rapped his hand on the table in frustration before Selby made a break of 76. Selby took frame 17 with a break of 97, and shared the first four frames to lead 11–9. Selby then won the next frame to lead 13–9, having won 12 out of 17 frames. O'Sullivan then won the last two frames of the session. He also won the next two frames of the final session, including a break of 114, the first century of the match. Selby won the next two frames to lead 16–14, with O'Sullivan playing attacking shots, \"hit-and-hope\" snooker escapes and \"going for broke\". O'Sullivan then won the next two frames with breaks of 138 and 71 to also go to a deciding frame. In the decider, O'Sullivan potted a long red, from which followed a 64 break, but he broke down when he missed a long range red to the green pocket. Selby cleared until the final red, and a series of safety shots were played, with O'Sullivan playing one more erratic escape from a snooker, and he potted match ball after Selby failed to leave the red safe.\nPost-match, Selby said \"I felt he was being a bit disrespectful to me and the game, not many players would just get down and hit them at 100 mph when you put them in a snooker. Some would look to work it out or put you in trouble. It just felt like he was doing that throughout the match...\" O'Sullivan, however, responded to all questions stating that his was poor, and that he had been struggling to play during the tournament. He also stated that his shot choice was due to his inability to control shots out of snookers the same way Selby did.\nFinal.\nThe final was played on 15 and 16 August as a best-of-35-frames match held over four sessions. German referee Marcel Eckardt took charge of his first World Championship final. The two players in the final were five-time world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan and first-time finalist Kyren Wilson. Although O'Sullivan had won four of their six previous meetings, Wilson had won their latest encounter in the semi-finals of the 2020 Welsh Open. O'Sullivan took a 3–1 lead in the first session after a number of missed shots by his opponent. He left the pink ball over the pocket in the fifth frame, allowing Wilson to take advantage and move within a single frame at 2–3. O'Sullivan won the next three frames, including the first century break of the match in frame seven, to lead 6–2 after the first session. BBC pundit Stephen Hendry commented, \"I tend to think the match is over. I hope I'm wrong, but I think 6–2 is too far for Kyren to come back from\".\nWilson made a break of 53 in frame nine but then made a tactical error and lost the frame, before O'Sullivan took the next to lead 8–2. Wilson won the next four frames, compiling breaks of 92, 50, and 58, to trail 6–8. In frame 15, he unintentionally a red ball on going into the after potting the blue, allowing O'Sullivan to take the frame. Wilson compiled a century break in the next frame, but missed a red in the final frame of the second session to trail 7–10 overnight. The 1997 champion Ken Doherty suggested that failing to pot the red was a missed opportunity for Wilson, whilst O'Sullivan would be \"over the moon\" to lose only five frames in the session. Six-time champion Steve Davis observed that O'Sullivan's body language during the session might suggest he was \"struggling\" and \"deteriorating\".\nWilson made a long pot in frame 18, before taking the frame with a break of 73. O'Sullivan responded by winning all of the next seven frames to finish the third session 17–8 ahead. The final session lasted just 11 minutes and contained only a single frame, as O'Sullivan won the match 18–8 with a break of 96. This was O'Sullivan's sixth world title and his 37th ranking event victory, a record number of ranking titles. He revealed afterwards that he had doubted his form was good enough to win the event: \"There was a part of me that decided that I didn't play enough – and I still probably don't play enough – to justify winning a tournament of this stature\".\nMain draw.\nNumbers given in brackets after players' names show the seedings for the top 16 players in the competition.

He played for Balmain in the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) competition.\nPlaying career.\nWilson made his first grade debut for Balmain in 1960. In 1963, Wilson was selected to play for New South Wales and played in one game against Queensland which New South Wales won convincingly 31-5. At club level, Wilson played in Balmain's semi final defeat against Parramatta.\nBalmain reached the 1964 NSWRL grand final by defeating North Sydney and then Parramatta in the preliminary final. The opponents in the grand final were the all conquering St George side. Wilson played at hooker in the final as Balmain took a shock halftime lead over St George before Saints came back in the second half to win 11-6 at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\nWilson played with Balmain until the end of the 1966 season. He missed out selection in the 1966 NSWRL grand final against St George which Balmain lost. Wilson was then controversially sacked by the Balmain club after it was revealed that he had been betting on matches. Wilson's former teammate Arthur Beetson later came to the defense of Wilson citing hypocrisy from the NSWRL board. Wilson died on 15 January 2000."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in New Zealand in 1896–97",
        "text": "The Australian cricket team toured New Zealand in November 1896, playing five matches. They were returning from their 1896 tour of England.\nIt was Australia's fourth tour of New Zealand, after tours in 1877–78, 1880–81 and 1886–87. The Australians played four matches against provincial teams, three of which fielded 18 players (the other team, Otago, fielded 15). The final match of the tour was against a New Zealand 15. It was New Zealand's first international match, following the formation of the New Zealand Cricket Council in 1894. All previous Australian teams had played only against provincial sides.\nThe Australians defeated Southland, Otago and New Zealand, and drew against Auckland and Wellington. As none of the matches were 11-a-side they are not considered to have been first-class.\nThe Australian team.\nHarry Donnan, the other member of the side that had toured England, did not play in New Zealand as he had to return to his employment in Sydney.\nThe tour.\nThe Australians arrived in Auckland on 5 November, after a three-week voyage from San Francisco on the \"Mariposa\".\nThe Canterbury Cricket Association gave up the chance of a match against the Australians at Lancaster Park in order that New Zealand could play its first match against another national team. The only previous matches by New Zealand had been against touring New South Wales teams in 1893-94 and 1895–96. The Canterbury association agreed to accept 75 per cent of the profit from the match at Lancaster Park.\nThe only fifty in the match was Clem Hill's 51 in Australia's second innings. Isaac Mills, with 20 and 28, was Auckland's only batsman to reach 20. Robert Neill took 6 for 71 in Australia's first innings, and William Stemson took 5 for 49 in the second. For Australia, Hugh Trumble took 6 for 37 in Auckland's first innings, and Ernie Jones took 5 for 36 in the second.\nThe Australians had arrived only the day before the match and were still feeling the effects of their voyage.\nJoe Darling scored the only fifty, making 59 and 37. Frank Holdsworth was Wellington's top scorer with 30 in the first innings. Alfred Holdship took 5 for 28 in Australia's first innings. For Australia, Giffen took 7 for 38 in the first innings and Trott 9 for 54 in the second.\nThe match went ahead despite severe vandalism to the pitch a few days earlier. The takings were £255, which gave the local association about £50 in profit.\nTrumble took 10 for 13 in the first innings, and Trott took 11 for 38 in the second. Kelly was the top-scorer in the match with 36; Southland's only player to reach double-figures was the captain, George Burnes, who made 18 in the second innings.\nRain on preceding days had dampened the ground, and the match was played on matting laid down over the pitch. The match concluded early on the second day, after which the Australians had a second innings to entertain the crowd, scoring 220 runs for six wickets in 90 minutes.\nAlthough they fielded the smallest side of the provinces, Otago provided the closest match. After leading on the first innings they needed only 82 to win, but were dismissed for 64 by Trumble, who took 9 for 30. The Otago number 12, Ralph Spraggon, made the highest score on either side with 36 in the first innings. Otago's opening bowler Arthur Fisher was their outstanding player, with 6 for 39 and 5 for 39.\nThe match takings were £303. Fisher so impressed the Australians that he was invited to go to Australia to play there and qualify for the Australian Test team. He spent some time playing in Melbourne in the 1897–98 season, but with little success, and returned to New Zealand.\nErnie Jones \"bowled at a pace quite foreign to the local batsmen\" and took 8 for 64 and 5 for 58. New Zealand's second innings included the first two fifties scored by any New Zealand batsmen against the four Australian touring teams: Len Cuff made 50 and Arnold Williams made 73. Their resistance gave Australia a fourth-innings target of 73 runs in the last hour of the match. The scores were tied at the scheduled time for stumps, but Cuff, the New Zealand captain, \"generously signalled to the umpire for another over\", which allowed Australia to score the required run.\nAlmost 10,000 spectators watched the match. Match takings were £550. Shortly after play ended on the third day, the Australians left for Australia on the \"Rotomahana\".\nAftermath and assessments.\nThe Australians' top run-scorer was Darling, with 222 runs at an average of 23.55. Kelly topped the averages with 143 runs at 28.60. Iredale's 75 in the match against New Zealand was the highest score for any side in all of the matches. The leading bowler was Trumble, with 34 wickets at an average of 6.29, while McKibbin, Jones and Trott each took 26 or 27 wickets and averaged between 7 and 9.\nThe Australians received £811 as their share of the tour's profits. At its meeting immediately after the tour, the New Zealand Cricket Council resolved to ask the Marylebone Cricket Club to rule on the legality of the extension of time after the scheduled close of play, as occurred in the New Zealand–Australia match."

In the second half, St George held off Wests to win their 3rd straight premiership 20-9. \nThe following season in 1959, Wests finished 2nd on the table. Bowman played in the first week of the finals against St George which Wests lost 35-25 at the Sydney Cricket Ground with Bowman scoring a try. The loss was Bowman's last game for the club as he missed out on playing in the club's preliminary final defeat against Manly-Warringah."

        "text": "The Bombers were an Australian professional \"League of Legends\" team based in the Tullamarine suburb of Melbourne. Their name came from their parent organization, the Essendon Football Club, which is nicknamed the \"Bombers\". The team competed in the Oceanic Pro League (OPL), the highest level of professional \"League of Legends\" in Oceania.\nHistory.\nThe Essendon Football Club announced on 14 December 2017 that it had purchased the OPL team Abyss Esports, becoming the second AFL team to enter the professional \"League of Legends\" scene after the Adelaide Football Club, which wholly acquired Legacy Esports in May 2017. However, unlike Adelaide, Essendon rebranded Abyss Esports along with the acquisition. The team was also relocated from Sydney to the Tullamarine suburb of Melbourne, where Essendon is based.\nThe Bombers' first roster consisted of top laner Christian \"Sleeping\" Tiensuu, jungler Sebastian \"Seb\" de Ceglie, mid laner Carlo \"Looch\" La Civita, bot laner Alan \"Tiger\" Roger, and support Andrew \"Rosey\" Rose. The team finished 6th in the OPL 2018 Split 1 and 5th in the OPL 2018 Split 2. Every player on the Bombers' original roster left in the offseason before the OPL 2019 Split 1 (except for Seb, who was moved to a substitute position). In December 2018, the team acquired a new roster consisting of top laner Min \"Mimic\" Ju-seong, jungler Choi \"BalKhan\" Hyun-jin, mid laner Tommy \"ry0ma\" Le, bot laner Victor \"FBI\" Huang, and support Jake \"Rogue\" Sharwood, the latter three of which were already veterans of the OPL. The new roster dominated the regular season of the OPL 2019 Split 1, ending in first place with a 19–2 record and directly qualifying for the grand finals, where they swept ORDER 3–0 to claim their first OPL title. The Bombers' victory in the grand finals qualified them for the 2019 Mid-Season Invitational as Oceania's representative in the play-in stage.\nThe Bombers were placed in Group A of the first round of the 2019 Mid-Season Invitational play-in stage, along with Turkish team 1907 Fenerbahçe, Vietnamese team Phong Vũ Buffalo, and Argentine team Isurus Gaming. The team ended third in their group and eleventh to twelfth overall with a 2–4 record, failing to qualify for the second round of the play-in stage. BalKhan left the team shortly after on 6 May 2019.\nLCS team Golden Guardians announced on 28 May 2019 that it had acquired FBI from the Bombers for its academy team. To fill in the vacant positions for OPL 2019 Split 2, jungler Jeong \"Wilder\" Jin-woo was acquired from Japanese team Burning Core, while Looch rejoined as a bot laner from the Bombers' academy team. The Bombers finished third in the regular season and fourth in playoffs after getting knocked out in the second round by ORDER.\nOn 2 December 2019, it was announced that the Bombers' OPL slot had been sold to Perth-based internet provider Pentanet. Pentanet founded the esports organisation Pentanet.GG shortly afterwards."

        "text": "Thomas Harley (born August 19, 2001) is an American-born Canadian professional ice hockey defenseman for the Dallas Stars of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted 18th overall by the Stars in the first round of the 2019 NHL Entry Draft.\nPersonal life.\nHarley was born on August 19, 2001, in Syracuse, New York, to Edmonton-born parents Brian and Stephanie. He was born into an athletic family as his father and three siblings all play ice hockey. His father played for the University of Alberta while his older brother Stuart played for the Milwaukee School of Engineering. His youngest brother Greg plays Junior \"A\" ice hockey for the Hearst Lumberjacks. Harley's older sister Emilie played college hockey for Robert Morris University before being drafted into the Premier Hockey Federation. While Harley played much of his youth hockey in Syracuse, he is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nGrowing up in Syracuse, Harley and his brother Stuart were often coached by their father on their respective teams. Although Harley originally played forward, his father converted him to defenseman to fill a gap in the lineup.\nMississauga Steelheads.\nHarley was selected by the Mississauga Steelheads of the Ontario Hockey League in the first round, 14th overall, during the 2017 OHL Priority Draft. In the 2017–18 season, Harley played his first game with the Steelheads on September 22, 2017, earning no points in a 4–3 loss to the Ottawa 67's. Harley earned his first career point, an assist on a goal by Albert Michnac, in a 4–3 loss to the Saginaw Spirit on October 15. Harley scored his first career OHL goal on December 8 against Kai Edmonds of the Barrie Colts in a 3–2 loss. Harley recorded his first OHL career multi-point game on February 23, earning two assists in a 4–0 win over the Niagara IceDogs. In early March, Harley had a three-game point streak, earning four assists in those games. Overall, in 62 games during his rookie season, Harley scored one goal and 15 points. Harley made his post-season debut on March 22, earning no points in a 6–2 win over the Barrie Colts. One week later, on March 29, Harley recorded his first career playoff point, assisting on a goal scored by Cole Carter in a 5–4 loss to the Colts. In six playoff games, Harley earned two assists.\nHarley saw much improvement in his second season with the Steelheads in 2018–19. On September 23, Harley recorded his first career three point game, earning three assists in an 8–6 loss to the Niagara IceDogs. Harley would record five more three point games during the season with the Steelheads. On December 31, Harley recorded his first multi-goal game of his OHL career, as he scored two goals against the Windsor Spitfires in a 9–5 victory. In 68 games, Harley scored 11 goals and 58 points. On March 22, Harley recorded his first career multi-point playoff game, earning two assists in a 5–2 loss to the Sudbury Wolves. In four post-season games, Harley earned four assists. Harley was named the winner of the Bobby Smith Trophy, named to the OHL Scholastic Player of the Year. Harley was also named to the OHL Third All-Star Team.\nHarley returned to the Steelheads for the 2019–20 season. He opened the season with points in each of his first 10 games, as he scored seven goals and added 10 assists during this streak, earning 17 points. On December 20, Harley scored two goals and two assists, earning his first career four point game, in an 8–2 win over the Barrie Colts. In 59 games, Harley scored a career-high 18 goals and added 39 assists for 57 points.\nProfessional.\nDallas Stars.\nLeading up to the 2019 NHL Entry Draft, Harley was ranked 11th among all North American skaters eligible for the 2019 NHL Entry Draft. He was praised by \"The Athletic's\" Corey Pronman and Mitch Brown for his transitional play and creativity. Harley was eventually selected by the Dallas Stars in the first round, 18th overall, at the NHL Entry Draft. Following the draft, Harley attended the Steelheads training camp before playing in the Traverse City annual rookie tournament. While he struggled in his first game, Harley finished the tournament impressing Dallas scouts. Harley then attended the Stars' training camp, where he drew comparisons to Dallas defenceman Miro Heiskanen from head coach Jim Montgomery. During preseason games, Harley had opportunities to play alongside Heiskanen and veteran John Klingberg while averaging over 20 minutes of ice time. He also worked with then-assistant coach Rick Bowness on how to improve defending offensively, including stopping turnovers. On September 23, 2019, the Stars signed Harley to a three-year, entry-level contract. After being cut from the Stars roster ahead of the 2019–20 season, Harley immediately returned to the Steelheads for their season.\nWhen the NHL resumed play for the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs, Harley was named to the Stars' taxi squad and stayed with them in the Edmonton bubble. Due to the pandemic, Harley took a three-day road trip from Syracuse to Edmonton in order to join the team. During the two months between his last Steelheads game and the taxi squad, Harley added 10 pounds of muscle due to working out consistently. He remained on the team's taxi squad until John Klingberg and Taylor Fedun were deemed unfit to play in the Stars' Western Conference seeding round-robin game against the Colorado Avalanche. Harley was placed in the lineup on August 5 alongside Esa Lindell and subsequently made his NHL debut that night. He finished his debut with 14 shifts through 10:58 of ice time as the Stars fell 4–0. Harley remained on the sidelines for the remainder of their games as Dallas met with the Calgary Flames in the first round. As the Stars qualified for the 2020 Stanley Cup Finals, Harley became the youngest player on either team's roster.\nWhen the NHL returned for the 2020–21 season, Harley was one of six players assigned to the Stars' taxi squad to start the season. However, he was re-assigned to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Texas Stars on January 29. Harley made an immediate impact with the team while playing on their top defensive pair with Joseph Cecconi while also killing penalties and playing on their first power play unit. He recorded his first professional goal in overtime on February 8 to help lift the Stars to a 3–2 win over the Iowa Wild. The goal also extended his point streak to three consecutive games to begin his AHL career. Through his first five days with the team, Harley accumulated two goals and three assists. Harley finished his rookie season leading all AHL defensemen with eight goals and ranked second in assists with 17. Although his 25 points helped him lead all league rookies, the Stars finished the 2020–21 season with a 17–18–3 record.\nHarley returned to the Dallas Stars training camp ahead of the 2021–22 NHL season but was again reassigned to the AHL before the final roster was announced. Despite struggling at the start of the season, Harley was recalled to the NHL level on November 1 after playing in six AHL games and recording one point. Although the team had a sufficient number of forwards and defensemen, head coach Rick Bowness stated that he brought Harley in to \"bring an element which could help the Stars create more goals.\" Harley made his NHL regular season debut the following night against the Winnipeg Jets. He finished the game with 15:09 of ice time, one shot on goal, four shot attempts, two hits, and two blocked shots. He skated in three more NHL games, registering five shots on goal while skating an average of 14:11 per game, before being returned to the AHL on November 11. Harley skated in 11 more games for the Texas Stars, adding six more assists, before being recalled to the NHL level again on December 17. He skated in a few more games for Dallas before being reassigned to their taxi squad on January 15. Harley recorded his first career NHL point, an assist, on February 28 in a game against the Buffalo Sabres. He added his first career NHL goal later that season on April 28 against the Anaheim Ducks. Harley finished the regular season with one goal and three assists while averaging 13:41 in ice time through 34 games. He also played a total of 27 games in the AHL and recorded 11 assists.\nAhead of the 2022–23 season, Harley was expected to become an NHL regular and take some of John Klingberg's responsibilities as an offensive defenseman. However, following a trade for Nils Lundkvist and an unimpressive training camp, Harley spent the majority of the 2022–23 season in the AHL with the Texas Stars. After being cut from training camp, Harley was limited to six NHL games at the conclusion of the Stars' regular season. Upon joining the Stars in the AHL, Harley was removed from teams' power-play unit for their first six games in order for him to focus more on his defensive capabilities. This resulted in him playing on the team's second penalty kill unit and tallying five points in 11 games. With his assistance, the Star's penalty kill unit allowed just 18 goals in 144 chances from October to mid-January and scored seven shorthanded goals. Harley also accumulated eight goals and 22 points through 38 games during this time. Harley's efforts were recognized by the league with his first-ever selection for the 2023 AHL All-Star Game. Harley finished with 10 goals and 24 assists as he missed the final six games of the season after being called up to the NHL. He remained with the Stars as they competed in the 2023 Stanley Cup playoffs, tallying one goal and added eight assists in 19 contests.\nInternational play.\nAlthough Harley holds dual citizenship, he has chosen to represent Canada at the international level. When speaking of the decision, Harley stated that while his family lived in New York, he was raised as a Canadian. Harley first played for Canada when he represented Team Canada Black at the 2017 World U-17 Hockey Challenge. He recorded no points over five games as the team placed seventh overall. The following year, he represented Team Canada at the 2019 IIHF World U18 Championships where the they placed fourth. During the tournament, Harley tallied one goal and three assists for four points. \nAlthough he represented Team Canada at the U18 Championships, Harley was one of the final cuts made to the Canadian roster ahead of the 2019 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Harley returned to Team Canada's selection camp the following year and was named to the final roster to compete at the 2021 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships."

        "title": "John Beecher (ice hockey)",
        "text": "John Beecher (born April 5, 2001) is an American ice hockey forward for the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted 30th overall by the Bruins in the first round of the 2019 NHL Entry Draft. He played college ice hockey for the Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey team from 2019 to 2022.\nEarly life.\nBeecher was born on April 5, 2001, in Elmira, New York to parents Bill and Natasha. Although his parents were collegiate athletes, they did not play ice hockey. His father played lacrosse and golf at Elmira College while his mother ran track and cross-country at Union College. Beecher began ice skating when he was six years old after spending the summer playing roller hockey and immediately made the local travel team. Beyond ice hockey, Beecher also played soccer, football, baseball, and lacrosse. Beecher and his older brother Bryce played together until 2015 when his brother had to get his hips replaced due to him being born with congenital hip dysplasia.\nPlaying career.\nCollegiate.\nBeecher was drafted 30th overall by the Boston Bruins in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft, but committed to play for the University of Michigan during the 2019–20 season. He was suspended one game for headbutting on February 3, 2020. Despite this, Beecher had a solid freshmen season with Michigan, scoring nine goals and seven assists. However, both the 2020 Big Ten tournament and the 2020 NCAA tournament were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ending the season early.\nBeecher started off the 2020–21 season where he left off, scoring four goals and four assists in 16 games. However, on February 28, 2021, it was revealed that Beecher had undergone shoulder surgery for a lingering injury and would miss the rest of the season.\nFully recovered from his injury, Beecher would play a full junior season at Michigan. However, he was unable to build upon his successful freshman year, scoring only six goals and nine assists for 15 points. He would, however, get his first taste of both Big Ten and NCAA tournament action. He would help Michigan win the 2022 Big Ten tournament, securing an auto-bid in the 2022 NCAA tournament, where Michigan would reach the Frozen Four before falling to the eventual champions Denver Pioneers.\nProfessional.\nBoston Bruins.\nOn April 13, 2022, Beecher decided to forgo his senior season at Michigan, and signed an amateur tryout contract with the Bruins' AHL affiliate, the Providence Bruins, for the remainder of the 2021–22 season. He contributed with 5 points through the remaining 9 regular season games, and made 2 post-season appearances with 1 point for Providence.\nOn May 16, 2022, Beecher was signed to a three-year, entry-level deal with the Boston Bruins.\nBeecher impressed in training camp, and earned himself a spot on the NHL roster to start the 2023–24 season for the Bruins. He would register his first NHL point with an assist on a Brad Marchand goal against the San Jose Sharks. On November 6, 2023, Beecher scored his first NHL goal in a 3-2 win over the Dallas Stars. Incidentally, Bruins rookie defensemen Mason Lohrei, who had played college hockey at Ohio State University, regarded as one of Michigan's rivals, scored his first NHL goal a few minutes after Beecher. On January 20, 2024, Beecher was sent down to Providence. Beecher was called up back to the Bruins for the 2024 Stanley Cup playoffs. He made his playoff debut in Game 1 of the first round against the Toronto Maple Leafs, and on his first playoff shift, scored his first playoff goal and point, opening the scoring for the series."

        "title": "Ice hockey in Latvia",
        "text": "Ice hockey in Latvia is the most popular sport in the country. The first hockey match on Latvian soil took place on February 15, 1909, with two teams facing Union and Strēlnieka Dārzs. However, it took another 20 years to supplant the popular sport of Bandy.\nHistory.\nIn 1929, Rīgas Strādnieku Sports un Sargs, a sports club of the Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party began playing the so-called \"Canadian hockey\" instead of Bandy. The first official game took place one year later, on February 15, 1930, between \" Riga center \" and a team from Königsberg. A crew member from Rīga was Bruno Kalniņš, who was sitting in Latvian Parliament at that time and later in political exile in Sweden.\nThe thirties and forties until the outbreak of World War II.\nThe Latvian Winter Sports Association began supporting ice hockey in 1930, and as early as 1931 Latvia was admitted to the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG), the predecessor of the IIHF.\nWith the international recognition of the association, various hockey clubs have emerged in the larger cities, including Universitas Sports, Wanderer, Union, Armijas Sporta Klubs (ASK) from Riga and Olimpiade from Liepāja. The Social Democrats' Club continued to exist before being shut down by regime Kārlis Ulmanis. The said clubs did not play in a closed league with a fixed schedule, but fought in smaller tournaments for titles. In the early years of the Latvian ice hockey ASK Riga dominated the games of the championship and became several Latvian champions.\nThe beginnings of the national team.\nThe first official game of the Latvia men's national ice hockey team, which consisted of pure amateurs, took place on February 27, 1932. Lithuania were beaten 3: 0. Only two weeks later, the national team participated for the first time in the European Championship. The Latvian team won one (3: 0 against Romania) and three defeats (0: 7 against Czechoslovakia, 0: 1 against France and 2: 5 against Great Britain). In the overall standings, Latvia took eighth place out of nine participating countries.\nA year later, the national team debuted at the World Cup in Prague. At the World Championships in 1935, she first met Canada and lost the game with 0:14. In 1936, Latvia participated for the first time in Winter Olympics, but all three games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen were lost: 0:11 to Canada, 2: 9 to Poland and 1: 7 against Austria. The first international match against the USA dates back to 1938, when Latvia scored a respectable 0: 1. Other international matches were mostly held on the way to or from World Championships as part of friendly matches.\nIn 1939, the Latvian Ice Hockey Federation contracted Canadian hockey player and sports teacher Larry Marsh to train the national team for a month. The Latvian hockey team had played a total of 26 games, including six wins, 16 defeats and four draws with a goal difference of 37:93, until 1940, the year of Soviet occupation and loss of independence.\nThe time of the occupation.\nThe outbreak of World War II and occupation by Soviet Union did indeed change Latvian hockey, but did not end it: the Soviets dissolved the existing teams and created new ones, such as Dinamo Riga. Two years later, when the Germans were re-established, the old teams were re-established, and other teams with typical Latvian names such as \"Ledus Lāči, Daugavieši, Skrejošais Holandietis\" and \"Ledus Simfonija\" were created. From 1944 to 1945 no ice hockey was played. In 1946 Latvia was excluded from the LIHG because of its affiliation with the Soviet Union, and only resumed in 1992 after Latvia established the Latvian Ice Hockey Federation in 1991.\nThe Postwar era.\nBefore the Second World War in the Soviet Union not hockey, but Bandy was played. After the war, the sporting leadership decided instead to introduce ice hockey, since this was recognized as Olympic sport. For the implementation of this plan, a Soviet delegation from Moscow drove to Riga, which returned there with a handwritten Russian translation of the Canadian ice hockey rules. It can therefore be said that one of the origins of the Russian hockey tradition lies in Latvia.\nOnly two years after the end of the Second World War and the incorporation of Latvia into the Soviet Union, Dinamo Riga began playing under the new name \"Daugava Riga\" with pre-war players in the first Soviet league. In 1948, Harijs Mellups became the league's best goalkeeper and was called to the Soviet National Team. Mellups died in the early fifties together with his clubmates near the Russian city Sverdlovsk in a plane crash.\nIn addition to Daugava, there were other teams such as Rīgas Vagonbūves Rūpnīca (the Latvian [RVR] club RVR), \"Spartaks\", \"VEF\" and Latvijas Bērzs, which are based on youth and/or senior level in regional championships. The only top club in Latvia, Daugava, remained in the highest league of the Soviet Union until the 1958/59 season.\nOther players from before the war emigrated to Germany, where between 1946 and 1949 up to eight Latvians competed in Augsburg under the nickname \"Letten-Team\". This team won under the leadership of Latvian players in the Southern German championships in 1948, before the team disbanded later. Rūdolfs Veide (\" dt. Rudolf Weide \") began a long and successful career as a player and coach in West Germany. In 1951 he was able to win the German Championship with the legendary Preussen Krefeld and between 1953 and 1954 he completed 18 international matches for the German national team. Later he became director of the Kenston Arena and supported the development of the Duisburg ice hockey.\nAnother member of the \" Latvian team \" was Ēriks Koņeckis, who several times as a player and coach German champion and later held the post of national coach.\nWith the descent of Daugava into the second division began for the Latvian hockey a time of mediocrity, which lasted until the end of the sixties. In 1968, Daugava was renamed again Dinamo Riga. Despite repeated attempts, the club did not manage to rise from the second Soviet League. Apart from some international friendlies against teams from Finland, Dukla Trenčín and Poldi Kladno from Czechoslovakia, Novosibirsk and Ust-Kamenogorsk, no further events from this period are worth mentioning.\nThe Tikhonov era.\nThe development of Latvian hockey got a boost in 1968 with the arrival of the Soviet coach Viktor Tikhonov, who began his legendary coaching career there. He was known for his penchant for discipline and revolutionized training methods using a VCR for game analysis. He also attached great importance to the physical fitness of his players. Due to the low playful potential of the Dinamo players, he set with the establishment of four rows of attack a strategy that used no Soviet team until then. Since this measure has increased the players' breaks between their working hours, the team was able to make up for technical disadvantages by speeding up and improving their condition against more highly rated teams. In 1973 Dinamo Riga could even celebrate the re-emergence in the first league after 14 years.\nRVR opened a hockey school in 1967 and a little later Helmuts Balderis produced a superstar. His nickname was \"Electric Train\" and besides Tikhonov he had a big part in the rise of Dinamo. Together with Tikhonov, he joined CSKA Moscow in 1977, participated 1976 with the Soviet national team in the Canada Cup and participated in five world championships and also won the silver medal at Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. In addition, he won twice in his career the title of the best scorer of the Soviet League and was once awarded the best striker in the World Cup. The second place of Lake Placid for the team of the USSR, however, was regarded in the home as a great failure. As one of the main culprits for the defeat in the then crucial game against the Team USA, the so-called Miracle on Ice, was also considered Balderis.\nDinamo Riga remained first class until the collapse of the Soviet Union. The ethnic composition of the crew changed dramatically in the 1970s and 1980s as more and more Russians displaced the Latvians. An exception were the goalkeepers Vitālijs Samoilovs and Artūrs Irbe. Irbe gave in the season 1986/87 his debut for Dinamo in the Eliteliga. The following season Dinamo Riga was able to celebrate the biggest success in the club's history by winning Soviet Championship League. With this success Dinamo was entitled to take part in the Super Series, an annual comparison between teams from the USSR and the National Hockey League, in addition to the former Soviet CSKA Moscow champion , In addition, Irbe and Samoilovs were selected in 1988 in the Soviet Union national ice hockey team. The latter was the same year with the national team Olympic champion.\nThe time after 1990.\nSince the beginning of Mikhail Gorbachev's term of office, Latvians have increasingly begun to strive for Independence. The Latvian Supreme Soviet declared independence of the Republic of Latvia on 4 May 1990. Only after the coup in Moscow in August 1991 followed the international recognition of Latvia. Irbe finally became the hero and role model of the Latvians when he participated in the defense of barricades against the Soviet Army and later refused to continue playing for the Soviet national team. Already in the 1991–92 NHL season he signed his first NHL contract with the San Jose Sharks and also won his first game.\nEmigrants and returnees.\nDue to the political turmoil, Latvian ice hockey collapsed and players dispersed in leagues around the world. Sandis Ozoliņš played in the fall of 1991 for the juniors of the Soviet national team, but began in 1992 in the International Hockey League to play. In the spring of 1992, Edmonton Oilers and Boston Bruins camps were held in Rīga, under which Sergejs Žoltoks and Grigorijs Panteļejevs were contracted. Many other players tried their luck in North America and played mostly in Minor Leagues, but did not make it into the NHL, so many returned home. Few have come up with a small number of missions in the NHL, such as Harijs Vītoliņš, Viktors Ignatjevs, Kaspars Astašenko, Raitis Ivanāns, Herberts Vasiļjevs and Panteļejevs , Only Irbe, Ozoliņš, Žoltoks and Kārlis Skrastiņš established themselves permanently in the NHL and play there even today. Other players moved to Western Europe or to the top clubs to Moscow. Harijs Vītoliņš soon returned from North America and played for many years for the EHC Chur.\nThe returnees from North America found a financially troubled country in which the hockey game for survival and players abruptly left their teams as soon as they offered a chance abroad. During the 1990s there was only one ice rink in Latvia, the time-honored Rigas Sporta Pils. Hockey teams emerged and disappeared and changed their names with the current main sponsor. Dinamo Riga was renamed Hockey Club Riga, then Riga stars (after the sponsor \" A / S Stars \") and finally in \" Pārdaugava \". First, the team played in the Russian \" Interstate League \", later in the Eastern European Hockey League before 1995, the bankruptcy was filed. The team was re-founded under the name \" Riga Juniors \", as today's successor to Dinamo, the HK Riga 2000 can be viewed.\nGoverning body.\nThe Latvian Ice Hockey Federation organizes amateur and professional ice hockey in the country.\nDomestic league.\nLatvia is one of the smaller member countries of the IIHF with (in 2017) a total of 6,699 registered ice hockey players, including 1,888 juniors and 101 women. There are also 185 registered ice hockey referees in the country. The Latvian Hockey Higher League (\" Latvijas Atklātais čempionāts \", Open Latvian Championship), which was held between 2006 and 2008 on the basis of the Sponsorship s of the company Samsung \"Samsung premjerlīga\" was founded in 1931. The first Latvian champions was Rīgas Unions. Between 1946 and 1990, the year of the Latvian Declaration of Independence, no official Latvian championship was played, but nevertheless a tournament was held annually.\nIn 1990 the Latvian league was a pure Amateur league, nowadays it is a league with pro s and semi-professionals playing in a total of six clubs. One of the participating clubs is the Lithuanian club SC Energija, which was admitted to the league in 2003. In addition to the series champion HK Riga 2000, another team from Riga took part, the SK Riga 20. This team was recruited almost exclusively from members of the Latvian U20 national team. After the Belarus Ice Hockey Federation decided to open its top division (the Belarusian Extraleague) again for foreign teams in the summer of 2008, the four best Latvian teams moved to Belarus. Since then, the new game mode has been in the form of a two-part championship, with the four best teams in the Latvian league and the four participants in the Belarusian extra league playing the Latvian championship in the form of play-offs at the end of the season. As a result of the economic crisis in 2009, the HK Riga 2000 went bankrupt and was dissolved. As a result, the former SK Riga 20 has been integrated into the club Dinamo Riga and will play as Dinamo-Juniors Riga.\nBelow the Latvian ice hockey league there is a second and third division and an amateur league in which nine teams fought for the title in the 2006/07 season.\nReestablishment of Dinamo Riga.\nAs part of the opening of the Russian Super League and renaming it in Kontinental Hockey League, a new hockey franchise was founded in Riga in April 2008 called Dinamo Riga and recalling the most successful times of Latvian hockey. Shareholders of the franchise are several companies and individuals, among which Itera Latvija (Latvian gas company belonging to Gazprom), Guntis Ulmanis (the fifth president of Latvia), Aigars Kalvītis (former prime minister of Latvia), Kalvitis has already invested 50,000 lats in Dinamo Riga and is planning another 150,000 lats and Aldis Pauniņš belong. In addition to some foreign players, Latvian national players such as Edgars Masaļskis, Rēdlihs brothers and Aleksandrs Ņiživijs have been committed to increasing the identification of Latvians with this new club. With the HK Riga 2000 a cooperation agreement was concluded, which provides for a player exchange of the two clubs. This is intended to give young and recovering players in particular the opportunity to play in a farm team match practice.\nThe season 2008/09 of the KHL began on 2 September 2008 with the game Dinamo Riga against Amur Khabarovsk, with Aleksandrs Ņiživijs 1–0 and thus the first goal in history the KHL scored. At the end of the main round Dinamo finished tenth in the table and reached the Play-off – knockout round, where the team in three games against the HK Dynamo Moscow eliminated.\nNational team.\nDuring the cold war the Latvian players played ice hockey under the banner of the Soviet Union. Since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 Latvians play under the Latvian national team.\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, the IIHF introduced qualifying tournaments for the Ice Hockey World Cup, as many new national associations wanted to participate. The Latvian national team won their World Championship | 1992 | qualifying matches against the Baltic neighbors Estonia and Lithuania and was allowed one year later participate in the C-World Cup in Slovenia. The C-championship was won with a 2–0 final victory against the Ukraine and Latvia rose to the B-group.\nIn the following three years, the national team took part in the B World Championships and won the B-WM 1996 just before the Swiss. At their First A Group Tournament, the Latvians surprised and took seventh place. Since then, the Latvian national team have always been part of the A-World Championship and have won several victories against the former occupying power, Russia, 2000 in Saint Petersburg and 2003 in Finland on 4 May, the day of the declaration of Latvian independence.\nWith the success of the national team also strengthened the hockey sport in Latvia. New ice rinks gradually developed and the Latvian Hockey Higher League became the strongest Baltic league after the dissolution of the EEHL, with a team from Lithuania and Estonia playing each. Two new arenas, the Skonto Arena and the Riga Arena were built to host the 2006 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships in Latvia, with a total of 15 ice rinks available. With the rise of the league and the improved play and training opportunities many Latvian players returned and the ethnic composition of the teams changed again in favor of the Latvians. National and local youth programs were launched so that in 2006 the Latvian Junior National Team was allowed to participate in the U20 World Youth Championship in [British Columbia]. In the same year, the Latvian U18 team was able to win Division I, so that in 2007 it was first class and participated in the U18 World Cup, but there again relegated to Division I. , In Division I U20 World Championship 2008, the Latvian Under-20 team won the tournament in Riga and returned to the A Group. In addition, Kaspars Daugaviņš was a top scorer and Artūrs Kulda was voted best defender of the tournament.\nThe Latvian national team has never reached beyond the quarter finals of any major ice hockey tournament, except for the 2023 championship after winning against USA and got a bronze medal.\nWomen's Ice Hockey.\nThe Latvian women's national team has been involved in international title fights since 1993 and won the B European Championship in the same year, allowing them to participate in the IIHF European Championship in 1995. This tournament was held in Riga and the ladies of the Latvian federation won only sixth place, so the Latvian selection returned to the B-group. A year later, however, the team could celebrate the runner-up of the B-EM.\nFrom 1999, the field of participants of the World Championship was increased. However, the Latvian women were only able to reach a back rank in the Qualifying Tournament for the A World Championship, and since then they have been playing in the IIHF World Championship B Group usually occupy places in the midfield.\nThe players of the national team are mainly recruited from the two top clubs of Latvian women's hockey, SHK Laima Riga and IceGirls. Two players were also contracted by the Russian women's team \" Tornado Moskau \" in 2007, which became the 2006/07 season Russian Champions. The SHK Laima Riga has participated in the IIHF European Women Championships several times and took part in the second round tournament in Berlin in October 2007.\nIn addition to the SHK Laima Riga and the IceGirls there is a third women's team, \" LSK Liepāja \". These three teams are playing the Latvian Women's Championship among themselves, with the SHK Laima team winning the title in 2006.\nLatvians in the National Hockey League.\nA total of 27 Latvians (6 goalkeepers and 21 outfielders) have already been on the ice in the National Hockey League. The first was Helmuts Balderis, who joined the Minnesota North Stars at the age of 36, to play for them in the season 1989/90. Sandis Ozoliņš, Artūrs Irbe, Sergejs Žoltoks and Kārlis Skrastiņš are the most successful among them, with Ozoliņš being the first Latvian to win the Stanley Cup. He did so in the 1995–96 NHL season with the Colorado Avalanche. Ozoliņš and Irbe have also played in NHL All-Star Games. Teodors Bļugers became the second Latvian to have won the Stanley Cup in the 2022-23 NHL season with the Vegas Golden Knights. The other Latvian NHL players are Aleksandrs Kerčs, Grigorijs Panteļejevs, Pēteris Skudra, Viktors Ignatjevs, Herberts Vasiļjevs, Kaspars Astašenko, Raitis Ivanāns, Jānis Sprukts, Mārtiņš Karsums, Harijs Vītoliņš, Kaspars Daugaviņš, Artūrs Kulda, Zemgus Girgensons, Teodors Bļugers, Rūdolfs Balcers, Ronalds Ķēniņš, Oskars Bārtulis, Elvis Merzļikins, Kristers Gudļevskis, Kristiāns Rubīns, Artūrs Šilovs and Matīss Kivlenieks.\nSergejs Žoltoks was considered one of the best Latvian players of all time. He was the best scorer of the Latvians in the World Championship 2004 in the Czech Republic and pointed to the NHL – Lockout in the season 2004/05 the experience of 633 NHL games for Boston, Ottawa, Montreal, Edmonton, Minnesota and Nashville. He began his professional career in the Soviet League at the then Dinamo Riga. During the NHL Lockout he played for Dinamo's successor club HK Riga 2000 in the open Belarus league, forfeiting lavish salaries in favor of his hometown club in Russia or Western Europe. His first heart problems were diagnosed with him at the NHL clubs and during an away game in Minsk he suffered a severe heart attack. On November 3, 2004, the Center died of heart failure at the age of 31. The resuscitation attempt of the doctors failed and Žoltoks died in the locker room.\nFan culture.\nIce hockey is considered one of Latvia's national sports. Dinamo Riga's successes drew much attention to the sport. In contrast, clubs in the 1990s did not attract many fans to the arenas, whereas the national team has become increasingly popular since its re-founding. For every world championship, large numbers of Latvian fans travel to and support to support national team, despite Latvia being one of the poorest countries in the European Union. \"In Oslo they were seen sleeping in buses and outside\", said IIHF president René Fasel in 1999 about the fans he described as the best in the world. During the 2000 World Championship, the Latvian Parliament interrupted its sessions so that the politicians could follow the national team's games on television. After beating Russia 3–1, the members of the Opposition and ruling party in the arms and sang together.\nAt the 2006 World Championship held in Latvia, Latvian fans caused a scandal during their 11-0 defeat against Canada. The audience felt discriminated against by referee Rick Looker in the first period, as he called many penalties against the Latvian team with the Canadian team scoring on the power play. The home crowd, predominantly made up of Latvian supporters, began throwing items onto the ice. The officiating crew took the break so that the ice could be cleaned and the crowd could be calmed down. But trouble began again in the third period as more objects were thrown onto the ice and the teams left the ice once again. To calm the situation, the Latvian player Jānis Sprukts spoke to the audience over the stadium speakers: \"Of course the referee makes many mistakes and we are not happy either, but please do not throw anything on the ice.\" After that, the game ended without further interference from the crowd.\nThere have also been many Latvians who have gone overseas to play in the Canadian Hockey League hoping to be drafted in the NHL Entry Draft."

In November 2019, Andrew Balbirnie was named as Ireland's captain across all three formats of international cricket.\nAhead of the first ODI match, the International Cricket Council (ICC) announced the use of technology to monitor front-foot no-balls for all matches during the tour. The third umpire called the front-foot no-balls, communicating this with the on-field umpires. It was used as a trial to see if it can be implemented further, without a detriment to the flow of the game. The trial was previously used in December 2019, in the matches between India and the West Indies.\nThe West Indies won the first two ODIs to take an unassailable lead in the series. The West Indies won the third ODI by five wickets, winning the series 3–0. It was the West Indies first ODI series win at home since beating Bangladesh in August 2014. For the first T20I, Jacqueline Williams was named as the third umpire, becoming the first woman to officiate as a third umpire in a men's international cricket match. The T20I series was drawn 1–1, after the second match finished in a no result due to rain.\nSquads.\nOshane Thomas and Obed McCoy also travelled with the West Indies team for the ODI matches, as part of a development initiative with Cricket West Indies."

        "text": "The Ireland cricket team toured India in March 2020 to play three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches against Afghanistan. On 11 January 2020, the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) confirmed the fixtures for the three T20I matches.\nOriginally, the tour had a one-off Test match on the itinerary. However, due to financial constraints with Cricket Ireland, the Test was not included on the tour schedule. Ireland previously toured India in February and March 2019 to play Afghanistan, a series that included the first Test match to be played between the two teams. Afghanistan won the one-off Test match by seven wickets to record their first victory in Test cricket. Prior to the tour, Asghar Afghan was reappointed as Afghanistan's captain across all three formats of international cricket.\nThe first fixture of the tour was the 1,000th match played by Ireland across all formats, since they played a two-day match in September 1855. Afghanistan won the rain-affected match, extending their record to eleven consecutive wins against Ireland. Afghanistan won the second match by 21 runs, to take an unassailable lead in the series. The third and final match of the series finished in a tie with Ireland winning the Super Over, with Afghanistan winning the series 2–1. It was Ireland's first win against Afghanistan in a T20I match since they beat them in the final of the 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier.\nSquads.\nStephen Doheny was added to Ireland's squad as a replacement for Gary Wilson, after Wilson became ill ahead of the series."

At the end of the 1910 season, Souths reached the NSWRL grand final against Newtown looking to be the first team to win 3 premierships in a row. Spence played in the match as Souths held a 4-2 lead late in the game. In the dying minutes of the match, Howard Hallett kicked the ball from the near the Souths goal line and Newtown player Albert Hawkes caught the ball on the full near the halfway line and on the touch line. The rules allowed Newtown to claim a fair mark which meant they had the chance to tie the game with a shot at goal. Newtown converted the penalty drawing the game but since they had finished first on the table during the regular season, they were declared premiership winners.\nSpence was also selected to play for Australia in 1910 and featured in one test against England. Between 1910 and 1912, Spence was selected to play for New South Wales and Metropolis which was the earlier version of the current day NSW City team. In 1914, Spence played 12 games as Souths won the premiership after losing only 2 games for the entire season. Spence retired from rugby league following the premiership victory. In total, Spence played 63 times for Souths across all grades. He died on 28 July 1948."

        "text": "The 1968–69 Denver Pioneers men's ice hockey team represented University of Denver in college ice hockey. In its 13th year under head coach Murray Armstrong the team compiled a 26–6–0 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the eighth time. The Pioneers defeated Cornell 4–3 in the championship game at the Broadmoor World Arena in Colorado Springs, Colorado. This was Denver's second consecutive championship and fifth in eleven years. Senior goaltender Gerry Powers tied the all-time NCAA career record of 76 wins in the championship match against the record-holder Ken Dryden.\nSeason.\nDenver was hoping to be the first team to defend its National Title since the 1961 Denver squad. With only three players leaving (due to graduation) Murray Armstrong's team had a good chance to repeat. Unfortunately, the team stumbles out of the gate, losing both games in its opening series at North Dakota. The Pioneers returned to Colorado for a home-and-home series against a weak Colorado College team before going back on the road. In Houghton Denver lost its third road game to Michigan Tech before finally managing a win the following night to pull their record back to even. Denver then took two games against still-building Minnesota–Duluth and ended the first part of its schedule against two national teams with the Broadmoor World Tournament. The Pioneers were able to defeat a non-olympic US Team handily before tying the Czech Team two days later (though the game was called for Denver).\nThe Pioneers began the new year with a series against Colgate and dominated the eastern team in both contests. After earning a road split with Michigan Denver returned to Colorado and didn't have to leave the state for the remainder of the year. Denver went 12–2 down the stretch, playing only 1 road game at Colorado College but its loss to Michigan Tech on February 1 cost the Pioneers their chance to win the Conference championship.\nDenver finished as the top western seed for the WCHA Tournament and after dropping the league's poorest team (UMD) in the first game they were given a gift from Colorado College who had knocked off North Dakota in the regional semifinal. Denver's defense continued its strong play and earned the Pioneers their second consecutive WCHA title and a trip to the 1969 NCAA Tournament.\nDespite having finished second in the WCHA, Denver possessed a better record and the defending national champions were given the top western seed, placing them in the semifinal against Harvard. Denver easily dispatched the Crimson 9–2, leaving only the 27–1 Cornell Big Red standing in their way. Cornell was both the top offensive and defensive team in 1968–69 and were led by the NCAA's all-time wins leader Ken Dryden. Denver, however, was able to reply with Gerry Powers, who had only one fewer wins than the future Hall of famer. The two titans clashed in one of the more anticipated national championships in history and early on it was apparent that Denver had come to play when Tom Gilmore deflected the puck past Dryden less than three minutes in. Cornell tied the game a little over 10 minutes later and the two teams ended the first ties 1-all. Both goalies continued to stymie the opposition until a Cornell penalty allowed Denver to pull ahead once more but this time it only took the Big Red two minutes to tie the game for a third time. Denver's withering attack continued to pressure Dryden and two more pucks got past the Cornell netminder to give Denver a late 2-goal edge. The drama of the contest was not finished, however, and after coincidental minors left the teams at 4-on-4, Cornell scored with the extra space then pulled Dryden to effectively give their team a power play in the final minute but Powers stood firm and allowed Denver to keep their lead and win the championship.\nKeith Magnuson led the team's offence from the blueline in the title game and his three assists won him the tournament MOP. He was joined by teammates Tom Miller, Bob Trembecky and Gerry Powers on the All-Tournament first team. Powers joined a very select group of goaltenders who won consecutive national titles and was the last to do so until Hunter Shepard in 2019. Magnuson and George Morrison were named to both the AHCA All-American West Team and All-WCHA First Team while Powers and Miller made the Conference Second Team. Morrison, for leading Denver in both goals and points, won the WCHA Sophomore of the Year Award.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | "

        "title": "La liga de los 5",
        "text": "La liga de los 5 () is a 2020 Mexican animated superhero comedy film, produced by Ánima and directed by Marvick Núñez in his directorial debut. The film stars the Spanish voices of Regina Blandón and Mariana Treviño. The film is Mexico's first take on the'superhero' genre, in style of that of \"The Avengers\", combined with traditional Latin American elements and legends.\nThe film was released in theaters in Mexico on January 10, 2020.\nPlot.\nYears ago, a team of superheroes known as the Liga de los 5 are on a mission to rescue Chema and Dolores, the team leaders' children, from Tin Marín. Chema and Dolores' mother decides to give in to complete a ritual Tin Marín was conducting, in exchange for her children. As their father and the rest of the team attempt to stop Tin Marín, the place collapses and kills Chema and Dolores' parents in the process.\nIn the present day, Chema, who has the ability to emanate capsaicin and turn his surroundings pungent, and Dolores, who can turn into a ghost —similarly as how her mother did— now live a civilian life with the team's gadgetman Tuerkas. After an inccident in which Dolores uses her powers gets uploaded to the internet, Tin Marín locates their house and kidnaps her. Tuerkas introduces Chema to the remaining Liga de los 5 team members: Catrina, a living skeleton who can manipulate bones and use them under her will; Tetlepanquetzal (or Tetle for short), an Aztec warrior who can turn into any animal he touches; and Tuna Guzmán, a lucha libre wrestler whose body can produce spines and cactus sap. Chema, Catrina, and Tetle go to recruit Tuna; as he gets into and argument with his employer, Tuerkas informs the team that Tin Marín is at the Museum of Anthropology getting his hands on a dagger needed for a ritual. Tin Marín steals it, but Tuna reveals he had replaced the original dagger with a decoy and kept the original one, although it got stolen from him before.\nThe team head to the Lagunilla market in hopes to find the dagger. Unbeknownst to them, Tin Marín tracks them down and retrieves the authentic dagger. Meanwhile, at Tin Marín's hideout, Dolores learns that Tin Marín wants to summon a supernatural entity known as Dr. Vampiro who could resurrect his daughter. The next day, Chema and Tuna find Tin Marín's hideout after Chema realizes he was given a flyer about a local fair earlier. After their sneak-in goes awry, Catrina and Tetle arrive in a modified bus and save both of them but the bus gets stuck in the underground. Tin Marín summons Dr. Vampiro but he is deceived by Dr. Vampiro as he does not resurrect his daughter as he had promised. The team escapes from the bus and Chema frees Dolores with the help of a redeemed Tin Marín, who sacrifices himself to liberate Dolores.\nDr. Vampiro gives sentinence to various landmarks of Mexico City; including Tláloc's fountain, the Angel of Independence, the Cabeza de Juárez monument, and the Monument to the Revolution, to cause havoc in the city. Catrina, Tetle, and Tuna successfully stop them as Chema and Dolores join powers to defeat Dr. Vamprio, he is defeated and crushed by the Estela de Luz. The reunited Liga the los 5 are recognized as saviors of the city.\nProduction.\nThe film has been in development at Mexico City-based Ánima, which worked on such animated content as \"El Chavo Animado\" and the \"Leyendas\" franchise. Producer and company president, Fernando de Fuentes, stated that one of the film's goals was for it to push beyond the beliefs of the national limits of the superhero film category. He said that the film has been planned for a prolonged time. \"What we want is to break the myth that there are only superheroes in other countries and show that you can have your own, very Mexican, everywhere and types,\" the producer said. \"It is a project that we have been polishing for a long time to do it.\"\nMarvick Núñez, the film's director, has faced the challenge of making the film's superhero effort, similar to the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, due to the fact that the genre has not been implemented in Mexico's film industry. Núñez wanted to introduce a \"different world\" based on life in Mexico, but also focus more on the characters' superpowers rather than the stereotypes. “There was a boom with Marvel and for years we have seen what happens with them[...],\" said the director. \"The instruction by the executive production was to make these Mexican characters[,] but also have comedy[.] [...T]he fun thing about doing this was that we did it as a team and we were all on the same channel.\". This is the first feature project Núñez has worked on, and with Ánima Estudios. Prior to the film, he worked traditional animation projects in 1996 before studying at Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas (now Faculty of Arts and Design). He later founded the Terrícola Studio in 2004 where he worked as an art and animation director, as well as taking part in 2D and CG animation. During an interview with Proceso, he explains the goal to make the first superhero film of Mexico and said that \"[...]we thought about our opportunity to include ourselves in this train, and from there the story and the characters took shape”. Núñez added that, \"[t]he criterion was: what would the superheroes be like if they really existed here? What would be a Mexican power and give rise to comedy? That's why Chema has the power to enchilar, but he enchila himself, so it seems more than carrying a curse.\"\nRegina Blandón, who voices Dolores, has explained the film's focused value of directing its superhero effort beyond Mexico's traditions. “It seems to me that much of the value of the film is precisely in that, that not only do the \"Avengers\" exist, but we see our culture reflected in superheroes where one of them has the power to \"spice\"[...]someone else. There is a catrina, an Aztec warrior and more. The intention is to rescue our traditions and make a film that goes beyond what we are used to,\" said Blandón.\nAnimation.\nThe film uses the 2D tween (\"flash\") animation format with computer-generated backgrounds for certain sequences, making it the first original 2D feature production from Ánima outside of their \"Leyendas\" franchise since 2012.\nCasting.\nRegina Blandón, voice of Dolores has expressed during an interview with El Sol de Mexico the complexity of her voice role, saying that \"[...]it's a challenge, it's too complex[...] This particular project caught my attention for the opportunity to do dubbing.” As a fan of animation, Blandón said that she also faced the challenge of recording her character's lines as she must have a tone similar to a 15-year-old, which her character is aged. “I am almost 30 and I speak like José José,” Blandón said. “[T]he director asked me to do it more and [m]ore [acute]. It was about channeling my \"chavita\" voice and I think it was achieved; [i]t was a new experience and a great acting challenge.”\nMusic.\nPablo Borghi has composed music for the film with an orchestral performance in Bratislava, Slovakia.\nRelease.\nThe film was released in theaters in Mexico on January 10, 2020. The film opened in 10th on its first weekend, grossing $4.6 million pesos (US$0.2 million).\nThe film was available for streaming in the United States through Pantaya.\nCritical reception.\nThe film received mostly favorable reviews. On Tomatazos, it has a \"Fresh\" score of 90% of positive critic reviews."

        "text": "The Copa América is South America's major tournament in senior men's soccer and determines the continental champion. Until 1967, the tournament was known as South American Championship. It is the oldest continental championship in the world.\nHonduras are not members of the South American football confederation CONMEBOL. But because CONMEBOL only has ten member associations, guest nations have regularly been invited since 1993.\nIn 2001, there were several problems with the planned Copa América and was even officially cancelled at one point. When plans of postponement to 2002 did not work out either, the tournament was held as scheduled. However, two teams withdrew: Invitees Canada had already disbanded the squad after the initial cancellation, and Argentina withdrew on the grounds that they were receiving death threats.\nCosta Rica was quickly found as a substitute for Canada - and eventually Honduras agreed to substitute for Argentina. The announcement came on July 10, one day before the inaugural match, and three days before the first match of Hunduras. In spite of star players missing, they did well in that tournament, placing Third, and with Amado Guevara awarded as the tournament's MVP.\nHonduras had won a continental title in the past: The CONCACAF Championship in 1981, a home tournament for them.\nIn 2016, the Copa América Centenario was a tournament co-hosted by CONCACAF and CONMEBOL and would have been Honduras' chance to play in a second Copa América, but they failed to qualify.\nSquad.\nNotable absences.\nAt the beginning of the 2001 Copa América, the final stage of the Honduran league system was still ongoing, and the involved clubs, Real España, Marathón, Olimpia and Platense, did not put their Honduran players up for national selection on such short notice and during the decisive phase of the season.\nFor that or similar reasons, several players were missing in the Honduran squad who held important roles at the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup one year prior. Carlos Pavón, Milton Núñez, José Pineda and Julio César de León were among those left out.\nRecord players.\nOf the five players who were active in all six matches, Amado Guevara has played the most minutes. He was only substituted in the 90th minute of the last match."

It was the 9th time the women's duet event was held at the Olympic Games.\nRussian synchronized swimmers won this event for the sixth time in a row, with Svetlana Romashina becoming a six-time Olympic champion.\nCompetition format.\nThe preliminary phase consisted of a free routine, then a technical routine with required elements. The scores from the two routines were added together and the top twelve duets qualified for the final. The final repeated the same free routine and the score from the final free routine was added to the score from the preliminary technical routine to decide the overall winners. Both preliminary free and technical routines starting lists were decided by random draw. For the final however, two groups were made: the last six and the first six qualified duets, the former group starting first.\nThe technical routine must be completed in between 2 minutes 5 seconds and 2 minutes 35 seconds. There are 3 panels of 5 judges for each routine. In the technical routine, one panel each considers execution (30% of score), impression (30%), and elements (40%). The execution and impression judges each give a single score, while the elements judges give a score for each element. Scores are between 0 and 10, with 0.1 point increments. The highest and lowest score from each panel (including within each element, for the elements panel) are discarded. The remaining scores are averaged and weighted by the percentage for that panel, with element scores weighted within the element panel by degree of difficulty. The maximum possible score is 100. In addition to a lift, jump, or throw (which can be placed anywhere in the routine, there are 5 required elements, which must be done in order:\nThe free routine time limits are 2 minutes 45 seconds to 3 minutes 15 seconds. There is no restriction on the routine. The 3 panels for the free routine consider execution (30% of score), artistic impression (40%), and difficulty (30%). Each judge gives a single score.

The maximum possible score is 100.\nQualification.\nA total of 22 duets qualify for the event. The 10 National Olympic Committees (NOC) qualified for the team competition were automatically awarded a place for duets. Each continent also received one dedicated duet place; Africa, Asia, and Oceania used the 2019 World Aquatics Championships to determine their selections, while the 2019 Pan American Games and the 2019 European Champions Cup served as qualifiers for the Americas and Europe.

        "title": "Time line (basketball)",
        "text": "The time line, in basketball, is a name for the center line that reflects the rule that the offensive team has a limited amount of time to advance the ball past this line, from the backcourt to the frontcourt, in a scoring drive.\nThe time line may have a name that reflects the amount of time, such as \"10-second line\" or \"8-second line\". Correspondingly, a violation of the rule may be called a 10-second violation or an 8-second violation.\nHistory.\nThe rule was introduced in 1933. It was basketball's first time restriction on possession of the ball, predating the shot clock by over two decades. FIBA and the NBA specified 10 seconds, but adopted an 8-second limit in 2000 and 2001, respectively.\nIn college basketball, the interval remains 10 seconds.\nProcedure.\nThe time limit is marked off by an official waving his arm to visibly count, if there is no shot clock available or the shot clock is turned off. However, women's college basketball introduced the 10-second limit in 2013–14, and provided that officials will not count the ten seconds but \"will use the shot clock to determine if a 10-second violation has occurred.\" The referee calls a violation if the offense still has the ball in the backcourt when the shot clock has counted down from 30 to 20 and now shows 19 (which first occurs at 19.9 seconds left). Men's college basketball has had the same rule since 2015-16, when the shot clock changed from 35 seconds to 30 seconds. In the NBA and FIBA, the shot clock marks off the 8-second count. \nAnalogs in other sports.\nIn field lacrosse, a team has 20 seconds to get the ball across the midfield line any way it can, and then 10 seconds to get the ball into its opponents' goal box. To satisfy the latter limit it is not necessary that a player in possession of the ball enter the box; although that is the most common way of doing so, that count is ended if the ball simply touches the ground inside the box. Officials typically use a timer for the 20-second count, as they may also at the same time be counting the four seconds a defensive player is allowed to stay in the goal crease with the ball, and count off the ten seconds manually."

Most teams in the first few years were community clubs and had no links to professional men's clubs. In 2014 the RFL set up an amateur league for the women's game, to help more women's teams get regular game time.\n2017–2020: Exposure.\nIn 2018 the competition started to receive a much higher profile, with the final being broadcast live on the BBC Sport website. In 2019 bookmakers Coral agreed to sponsor the competition – in addition to their sponsorship of the men's Challenge Cup – and it was also announced that the final of the 2019 Cup would be played as part of a triple-header with the semi-finals of the men's 2019 Challenge Cup at the University of Bolton Stadium on 27 July 2019. The 2019 competition also saw the introduction of a new trophy commissioned by the RFL. In 2020, the competition was suspended after the first round and later cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n2021–present: Restructuring.\nIn the 2021 competition, entry was restricted to the ten teams in the Super League. The following year the competition expanded to 16 teams (12 Super League, three Championship and one Super League South) and a group stage was introduced with the top two teams from the four groups advancing to the quarter-final stage.\nChallenge Shield.\nBetween 2012 and 2019 teams that were knocked out of the cup in the early rounds went on to compete in the Challenge Shield competition. In 2021, with entry to the Challenge Cup restricted, the Rugby Football League launched a Women's League Cup for teams outside of the Super League and Championship."

At over 11.5 acres they are the second largest allotment site in the London Borough of Haringey (who also owns them). As with nearly all allotment sites in the borough it is (mostly) run by the site's association, the Golf Course Allotment's Association (GCAA).\nHistory.\nThe land was once farmland, as was most of this part of North London. Bluebell Wood, which is next door to the allotments, once formed part of an ancient wood called Tottenham Wood. It is possible that this same wood once covered the allotments.\nIn 1893 the Muswell Hill Golf Club was founded. The club had a course that covered the allotment site. During the First World War they were forced to give up the lease on part of the course for allotment gardening. The golf club never got the land back after the war, and the allotments have been there since.\nThe GCAA was originally founded in the 1940s as a local allotment and horticultural society with the betterment of allotment sites as an aim. Over time it focused on the Golf Course Allotments over others, subsequently changing its name to reflect this.\nThe site today.\nToday the allotment has over 230 plots gardened by over 250 tenants. There is a shop for plot holders, a composting toilet, and a community hall. Throughout the year are events such as cafés and parties which raise funds to improve the site. The site is open to the public one day a year during the Summer Show. Normally held in early September, the Show is opened with the National Gardens Scheme.\nAs of 2022, the wait time for an allotment plot is four years."

        "text": "Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition is a 1998 golf video game developed by American studio Friendly Software and published by Microsoft for Microsoft Windows. It is the fourth game in the \"Microsoft Golf\" series, following \"Microsoft Golf 3.0\". The game uses a revamped design that is substantially different from its predecessors.\nSome critics considered the game to be a significant improvement over its predecessors, with particular praise for its graphics. Sales were poor, with the game ranking 232nd for computer game sales during 1998. It was followed by \"Microsoft Golf 1999 Edition\".\nGameplay.\n\"Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition\" features four golf courses: The Links, and Teeth of the Dog, both at Casa de Campo in the Dominican Republic; and Lake Michigan's Bay Harbor Golf Club, and The Preserve 9 at Bay Harbor. The latter is a 9-hole course, while the other three each contain 18 holes. The game features five game modes: Bingo Bango Bongo, match, scramble, skins, and stroke. Four golf swing methods are featured, including Natural Swing and Sim Swing; the former method uses the motion of a computer mouse to simulate the swing, while the latter option has the game take the swing for the player, who has no involvement in the process. The game also features regular two-click and three-click swing methods that are common to golfing games.\nThe player can also choose pin placement, and has a variety of camera angles and replay options. Wind and weather can also be customized. The game includes commentary from David Feherty, who reacts to the player's golfing. Ten golfer models are featured, including males and females of varying skin tones, and the player can use a variety of options to customize the character. The game supports multiplayer for up to four players, with various options such as LAN and Microsoft's Internet Gaming Zone.\nDevelopment.\nThe previous games in the \"Microsoft Golf\" series are basic versions of the early \"Links\" golfing games by Access Software. Microsoft's previous golf games are also Microsoft Windows versions of the \"Links\" games, which were being published for DOS at the time. Microsoft and Access Software ended their partnership in 1996, when the latter began developing \"Links\" for Windows, making their series a direct rival to \"Microsoft Golf\". For \"Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition\", Microsoft chose Friendly Software to develop the game, which uses a revamped design that is substantially different from its predecessors. Friendly Software previously developed \"Greg Norman Ultimate Challenge Golf\", and \"Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition\" uses the same game engine. The game uses DirectDraw for graphics rendering. \nRelease and marketing.\nThe game was published by Microsoft in the United States in May 1998. That month, Microsoft and company Eddie Bauer partnered to promote \"Microsoft Golf 1998 Special Edition\", a basic version of the game featuring only the Preserve 9 course. It was created specifically for Eddie Bauer. The Eddie Bauer logo and website are featured in the game, which was given away to Eddie Bauer customers who purchased merchandise costing $75 or more. A basic demo version of the full game, titled \"Microsoft Golf 1998 Lite\" and featuring only the Preserve 9 course, was included with Microsoft Plus! 98 upon its release in June 1998.\nIn August 1998, Microsoft hosted a promotional media event at Washington's Museum of Flight, coinciding with the 1998 PGA Championship being held in the state, where Microsoft was headquartered. The event, titled \"Battle in Seattle\", was a three-hole matchup between professional golfers Craig Stadler and Michelle McGann, who competed against each other in the game. The event included a jumbo screen to watch the match, as well as 10 computers featuring demo versions of the game. The event garnered only about 80 people, below Microsoft's expectations. Media attendees included ESPN and Fox Sports, in addition to several PGA Tour players.\nReception.\nSome critics considered \"Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition\" to be a significant improvement over its predecessors. Stephen Poole of GameSpot wrote that \"the only way you'd know it had anything to do with the previous versions is from the name.\" Scott A. May of \"Computer Gaming World\" praised the game for retaining \"the polished, user-friendly feel of the previous versions, but little else.\" He stated that veteran fans of the series would be surprised by \"Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition\", while people who ignored its predecessors for their lack of depth \"finally have a reason to take another look\" at the series. Gordon Goble of Gamecenter stated that nearly everything about the series had been changed for the better with the release of \"Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition\". Paul Rosano of \"Hartford Courant\" called it \"a worthwhile and successful, albeit overdue, upgrade.\"\nThe graphics were praised, although some critics still considered them inferior when compared to \"Links LS 1998\" and \"Jack Nicklaus 5\". Poole considered the graphics to be \"the biggest area of improvement,\" stating that they were nearly as good as the latest \"Links\" and \"Jack Nicklaus\" games. May praised the video-captured golfers for being seamlessly blended into the foreground. Other critics praised the golfer animations as well, but were disappointed by the golfers' lack of pre- and post-shot reactions. Goble particularly praised the aerial previews of each hole, considering them to be the best of any golf game. \nMay called the sounds on the course \"outstanding\" but stated that some sounds \"seem to be missing,\" such as the ball hitting the pin or splashing into water. Nick Smith of AllGame considered the sounds to be \"very realistic\" and stated that they \"do not get in the way of the gameplay as they sometimes do in other golf games.\" Goble criticized the ambient audio for including \"annoying, perpetually chirping birds and crickets\". Doug Pierce of Sports Gaming Network criticized the audio for its lack of variety and its repetitive sounds of birds and sprinklers. Smith enjoyed the commentary and called it \"relevant and even sympathetic at times\". May believed the commentary to be superfluous, while Poole stated that the commentary \"isn't particularly humorous or helpful\". Goble stated that the commentary was rarely accurate in its reaction to the player's golfing.\nSome criticized the game's click-swing methods for requiring fast responses from the player. May considered the array of swing methods to be \"by far the most impressive\" of the game's options. He also praised the pin placement option for significantly increasing the game's long-term playability. Dennis Lynch of the \"Chicago Tribune\" considered the Natural Swing \"anything but natural,\" although he praised the various game options and the Internet Gaming Zone feature. Jeff Lackey of \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\" praised the multitude of game options, noting that some of them were not yet offered by rival golfing games. May praised the \"clean\" interface, while Poole praised it for providing quick access to parts of the game.\nRosano praised the courses, including Teeth of the Dragon, as a \"big plus,\" while stating they were all \"expertly rendered.\" May was disappointed that the game, unlike its predecessors, is not compatible with courses from the \"Links\" series or the earlier \"Microsoft Golf\" games. Poole was also disappointed by the limited course selection, and the lack of an off-line tournament mode. Goble believed that the four available courses provided adequate variety, although he criticized some gameplay inconsistencies and errors, and stated that the distance to the golf hole can be \"extremely deceiving\" at times. In comparison to rival golf games, Goble called \"Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition\" a \"promising amateur in a world of seasoned veterans.\" He concluded that it was too flawed to \"heartily recommend,\" stating that at best, it was an \"interesting alternative\" in the genre of computer golf. Rosano concluded that the game was best for casual players, stating that there were better golf simulations available for hardcore players. Sales of the game were poor; among computer games, \"Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition\" ranked 232nd for sales during 1998."

        "text": "Microsoft Golf 1999 Edition is a golf video game developed by American studio Friendly Software and published by Microsoft for Microsoft Windows. It was released in the United States in late 1998. It is the fifth game in the \"Microsoft Golf\" series, following \"Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition\", which was also developed by Friendly Software.\nSome critics noted similarities between the game and its predecessor. It was praised for its variety of options, although critics believed it was not as good as other golfing games. The game was the best-selling computer sports game of 1999, with 154,741 copies sold. It was followed by \"Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition\".\nGameplay.\n\"Microsoft Golf 1999 Edition\" is similar to its predecessor, \"Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition\". Improvements include more realistic chipping, better Internet support, and additional options for customization. The game features seven courses, including the following four from the previous game: The Links, and Teeth of the Dog, both at Casa de Campo in the Dominican Republic; and Lake Michigan's Bay Harbor Golf Club, and The Preserve 9 at Bay Harbor. Among the new courses is the Donald Ross Memorial in Harbor Springs, Michigan, featuring different course holes designed by Donald Ross. The other new courses are Eagle Heights, a fantasy valley/woodland course set somewhere in the Pacific Northwest; and Medalist Golf Club, in Hobe Sound, Florida. Courses include various weather options relating to sky, wind, ground, and fog conditions. Five game modes are featured: Bingo Bango Bongo, match, scramble, skins, and stroke.\nThe player is presented with a choice of 18 golf clubs, and can also customize the physical strengths and design of the onscreen golfer character. Included are two male models and two female models. The game has four golf swing methods, all previously featured in \"Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition\". These include two-click and three-click swing methods, as well as Natural Swing and Sim Swing; the former uses computer mouse motion to execute the swing, while the latter option has the game make the swing on behalf of the player. The player can choose to take mulligans and gimmes. David Feherty provides commentary on the player's golfing. The game includes several multiplayer options, and also supported Microsoft's Internet Gaming Zone at the time of its release.\nReception.\nSome critics noted similarities between \"Microsoft Golf 1999 Edition\" and its predecessor, believing that the biggest difference between the two was the addition of three new courses and some minor improvements. According to T. Liam McDonald of \"GameSpot\", the game followed \"the current trend among sports games of publishing a new edition every year and only revamping the whole system every couple years.\" Jeff Lackey of \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\" considered the game to be more of a course add-on package for \"Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition\", while \"PC Accelerator\" wrote that the game \"is not a sequel so much as an expansion disc\" for its predecessor; the magazine further stated that none of the game's minor improvements had a significant change on the overall game. Critics believed that the game was a good value when taking into consideration a rebate offer, which was available to consumers who purchased the previous \"Microsoft Golf\" game.\nThe game's interface was praised as was the multiplayer and the variety of options. However, critics generally believed that there were better golfing games available, such as the \"Links\" series, the \"Jack Nicklaus\" series, and the \"Tiger Woods PGA Tour\" series. Lackey praised the golfer customization options, but concluded that there was \"no good reason to pick this retread\" over other golf games such as \"Links LS 1999\" and \"Tiger Woods 99 PGA Tour Golf\". Daniel Morris of \"GamePro\" also considered the game average and believed that \"Links LS 1999\" was superior. Mike Snider of \"USA Today\" called it a \"serviceable golf sim that doesn't make the cut\". James Bottorff of \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\" wrote that other than the title, \"it's hard to find anything different between this game and the countless other golf titles on the market.\"\nGordon Goble of \"CNET Gamecenter\" believed it to be a reasonable choice for computer golfers considering its array of game options, but he also felt that there were better golf games available, as did Michael L. House of \"AllGame\". House wrote that \"Microsoft Golf 1999 Edition\" has \"too many irritating little bugs,\" including an issue in which the game was not accurately aware of the golfer's location on the course. With the game's improvements over its predecessors, McDonald considered the \"Microsoft Golf\" series to now be the third best golf game series, behind \"Links\" and \"Jack Nicklaus\". Trent C. Ward of \"IGN\" felt that other golfing games were superior in nearly every aspect, but concluded that the game was an \"excellent choice for those looking for a quick and easy golf game without all the frills.\" Brian R. Fitzgerald of \"The Wall Street Journal\" considered it a good game for beginners.\nThe game uses DirectDraw for graphics rendering. Some critics considered the graphics to be average. McDonald believed that the courses were \"detailed and finely rendered\" but not as good as those featured in the \"Links\" and \"Jack Nicklaus\" games. He stated that the golfers \"appear smoother, more realistic, and more fluid than ever.\" Sports Gaming Network praised the graphics but considered those of \"Links LS 1999\" to be superior, while mentioning that the golfers had \"more fluidity\" than any other golf game. Ward considered the graphics good but average, while stating that objects in the game suffered from \"cardboard cutout syndrome.\" Goble praised the graphics but believed that the game felt \"stagnant\" in some way: \"Perhaps it's the hardened flags, static water, and spray-less sand traps, or the animation-free background and muted colors. Maybe it's the lack of viewing options--three in all, only two of which are available at any one time. Whatever it is, it's not easy to decipher wind direction or judge distances--all in all a disconcerting feel.\" House considered the graphics to be very good for the most part, but he stated that they had an artificial feel. He further wrote, \"It's disconcerting to see the flag on the green point one way when the wind meter is showing a strong breeze coming from the other direction.\"\nThe ball physics received some criticism. Lackey felt that the physics were acceptable but not as good as rival golf games. Sports Gaming Network considered the physics above average and realistic, but also not entirely convincing. Fitzgerald praised the club and ball physics, calling them \"remarkably realistic, a tough feat for a lot of golf games.\" For the swing methods, Ward felt that the Sim Swing was too complex but wrote that the Natural Swing \"proved to be very cool indeed.\" Goble considered the click-swing methods unnatural and frustrating, but called the Natural Swing \"intriguing.\" \"PC Accelerator\" felt that the swing meter was difficult to use. Snider called it a good game for beginners because of its Sim Swing feature. Sports Gaming Network considered the Sim Swing method boring, but praised the Natural Swing as an \"easy to learn/tough to master\" option. McDonald was disappointed that the game, unlike earlier \"Microsoft Golf\" games, is not compatible with courses from \"Links\" add-on disks. Sports Gaming Network was disappointed with the number of courses, but considered each of them to be impressive, and further stated that the game seemed to have the fastest loading times of any golf game available. Ward also praised the courses.\nThe sound received some praise, although \"PC Accelerator\" also questioned how important sounds really are in a golf game. Morris considered the sound effects to be basic and wrote that the game was \"a flat experience for the ears,\" stating that it lacked the \"aural flair\" of its competitors. Fitzgerald stated that the sound effects included \"weird moos and all sorts of animal cackles\" as if each course was set on a farm. Goble considered the ambient sounds varied and enjoyable, but also \"a bit bird-heavy.\" He felt that the commentary was \"arrogant and error-filled.\" McDonald considered Feherty's shot-specific commentary good but stated that his \"color commentary is hollow and annoying.\" House noted an issue in which Feherty sometimes stuttered his commentary, while Bottorff stated that Feherty's commentary was \"in perfect tune with the progression of the game.\" Sports Gaming Network praised the commentary.\n\"Microsoft Golf 1999 Edition\" was the best-selling computer sports game of 1999, with 154,741 copies sold, equaling a total of approximately $3.1 million in revenue."

The defending team was Germany.\nThe winning team was Norway.\nCompetition format.\nThe relay teams consist of four biathletes. Legs 1 and 2 are skied by the women, and legs 3 and 4 by the men. The women's legs are and men's legs are . Every athlete's leg is skied over three laps, with two shooting rounds: one prone and one standing. For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually from the spare round holders or from bullets deposited by the athlete into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still standing targets, one penalty loop must be taken for each remaining target. The first-leg participants all start at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of their position in the race), then for the remainder of the relay, the athletes shoot at the lane corresponding to the position they arrived (arrive at the range in 5th place, shoot at lane five).\nThe single mixed relay involves one male and one female biathlete each completing two legs consisting of one prone and one standing shoot. The female biathletes all start the race at the same time and complete one leg before exchanging with their male counterparts who complete one leg before exchanging again with the female skier who after completing another leg switches again with the male biathlete who completes the race. The rules regarding shooting are the same as in the regular mixed relay."

        "text": "The 2019–20 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team represented the University of California, Los Angeles, during the 2019–20 NCAA Division I season. The Bruins were led by first-year head coach Mick Cronin and played their home games at Pauley Pavilion as members in the Pac-12 Conference. UCLA finished the season with a 19–12 record. After starting slowly at 8–9, they went 11–3 and finished second in the Pac-12 at 12–6. Cronin was named the Pac-12 Coach of the Year, while junior Chris Smith earned first-team All-Pac-12 honors and was voted the Pac-12 Most Improved Player. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Pac-12 tournament was canceled before the Bruins' first scheduled game in the quarterfinals, and the NCAA tournament was called off as well.\nUCLA started the season 7–6 in non-conference play, including home losses to mid-major programs Hofstra and Cal State Fullerton. After beginning 1–3 in the Pac-12, they won seven of their next nine, including an upset win on the road against Arizona followed by consecutive 12-point second-half comebacks against Washington State and Washington. Still, the Bruins needed a strong finish to offset their early-season struggles and become contenders for an NCAA tournament bid. Their late-season surge continued with their fifth straight win, defeating No. 18 Colorado on the road to sweep the season series. UCLA erased a nine-point deficit in the second half with a 14–0 run and recorded 14 deflections in the final 13 minutes against the Buffaloes, which largely contributed to the Bruins' rise up 25 spots that week to No. 76 on the NCAA Evaluation Tool, one metric used by the NCAA tourney selection committee. UCLA extended its winning streak to seven after home wins against Arizona State and Arizona. It was the Bruins' first regular season sweep in their rivalry with the Wildcats since 2012–13. In their regular-season finale, UCLA lost 54–52 at USC after the Trojans made a game-winning three-point field goal with one second remaining. The Bruins earned a No. 2 seed and a first-round bye in the Pac-12 Tournament. On March 12, the Pac-12 canceled the tournament prior to its quarterfinals due to the coronavirus pandemic, and the NCAA Tournament was canceled later that day as well.\nUCLA's roster consisted of mostly role players. For the first time since 1977–78, it did not include a McDonald's All-American; the honor began in 1977. The team's most high-profile player—Shareef O'Neal, the son of Hall of Fame player Shaquille O'Neal—transferred midseason after failing to earn regular playing time. Smith, who averaged 13.1 points per game, was the only Bruin to average in double figures.\nPrevious season.\nThe Bruins finished the 2018–19 season 17–16, 9–9 in Pac-12 play. They were led by sixth-year head coach Steve Alford until he was fired mid-season and assistant Murry Bartow was named the interim head coach. Their lineup featured three former McDonald's All-Americans: sophomores Jaylen Hands and Kris Wilkes were both named second-team All-Pac-12, while first-year player Moses Brown was voted to the Pac-12 All-Freshman Team. UCLA finished the season 17–16, and lost in the second round of the Pac-12 tournament. They missed the postseason for the second time in four years.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=| Non–conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| Pac-12 regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| Pac-12 Tournament"

Historically, the trials were held in April several months before the Olympics were held. This will be now changed to follow the American model where the trials are held six weeks before. The 2019 Australian World Swimming Trials will be held at the Brisbane Aquatics Centre in June 2019 and will be selection trials for the 2019 World Aquatics Championships in Gwangju, South Korea.\nThis event doubled up as the national trials for the 2019 World Para Swimming Championships in London, the 2019 Summer Universiade in Naples, Italy and the 2019 FINA World Junior Swimming Championships in Budapest, Hungary.\nThere was an increase in the number of events contested from 63 to 64 from the 2018 National Championships with addition of the mixed 4 × 100 m medley relay. This was due to the IOC announcing in June 2017 that this event as well as the men's 800 m freestyle and the women's 1500 m freestyle events will be added to the Olympic swimming program at the Tokyo 2020 Games.\nEmily Seebohm chose to miss this meet to participate in the inaugural FINA Champions Swim Series event in Guangzhou, China, while Thomas Fraser-Holmes was away competing at the Helsinki Swim Meet and Bergen Swim Festival. Mack Horton was forced out due to a shoulder injury. \nDuring night three of the championships, Cate Campbell on behalf of Swimming Australia paid tribute to Kenneth To who died a few weeks prior.\nDefending women's 200 metre backstroke champion Kaylee McKeown was disqualified during the heats of the event. She was permitted to swim a time trial where she stopped the clock at 2:08.56 well ahead of Minna Atherton's winning time of 2:11.18 in the final.\nThe legends relay was a mixed 4 × 50 m freestyle event swum on the penultimate night of the meet.

        "text": "Justin Taylor James (born January 24, 1997) is an American professional basketball player who last played for the Cleveland Charge of the NBA G League. He played college basketball for the Wyoming Cowboys. He was selected by the Sacramento Kings in the second round of the 2019 NBA draft.\nCollege career.\nA native of Port St. Lucie, Florida, James was an unheralded basketball recruit out of high school, generating only one high-major offer from Mississippi State, before ultimately going to the University of Wyoming. He became a full-time contributor by his sophomore year and increased his scoring average each year. James led the Mountain West Conference in scoring during his final season at Wyoming, averaging 22.1 points per game as a senior, despite playing as a point guard, a position he does not normally play, because Wyoming needed James to have the ball as much as possible during an 8–24 season. He also led the Cowboys with 8.5 rebounds and 4.4 assists per game, and made second-team All-Mountain West. James had a three-point field goal percentage of 33.7 percent during his college career. Despite his high scoring, James posted career lows in field goal percentage (40.9 percent) and three-point field goal percentage (29.6 percent) during his senior high, as well as 4.1 turnovers per game.\nJames finished his college career with 2,061 points, the third highest in Mountain West history. He also participated in the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament, one of 64 seniors from around the country invited to the event.\nProfessional career.\nSacramento Kings (2019–2021).\nJames was selected by the Sacramento Kings in the second round of the 2019 NBA draft with the 40th overall pick, and became the first University of Wyoming player drafted since the Los Angeles Lakers selected Larry Nance Jr. in 2015. CBS Sports had ranked James as the 96th-best prospect heading into the draft, while the \"Sporting News\" and NBADraft.net had him unranked, and most mock drafts did not predict he would be picked. Sacramento general manager Vlade Divac said the team drafted him because they followed his college career and appreciated his passion and production: \"We talked to everybody about his professionalism and his love for the game. We were so excited when we spent time with him in Sacramento.\" On July 10, 2019, the Sacramento Kings announced that they had signed James. On October 25, 2019, James made his debut in the NBA, coming off the bench in a 112–122 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers with two points. He scored 30 points for the G League's Stockton Kings in a win over the Iowa Wolves on January 11, 2020.\nCleveland Charge (2021–2022).\nOn September 22, 2021, James signed a two-way contract with the Utah Jazz. However, he was waived on October 1. On October 13, he signed with Cleveland Cavaliers, but was waived three days later. On October 23, he signed with the Cleveland Charge as an affiliate player. James averaged 17.8 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 2.7 assists per game.\nOn December 26, 2021, the New Orleans Pelicans signed James to a 10-day contract. However, he never appeared in a game for the team.\nOn January 5, 2022, James was reacquired by the Cleveland Charge.\nJames joined the Orlando Magic for the 2022 NBA Summer League.\nMetropolitans 92 (2022–2023).\nOn December 13, 2022, James signed with Metropolitans 92 of the LNB Pro A.\nReturn to the Charge (2023).\nOn March 2, 2023, James was re-acquired by the Cleveland Charge."

        "title": "Archery at the 2019 European Games – Women's individual recurve",
        "text": "The women's individual recurve competition at the 2019 European Games was held from 21 to 26 June 2019 at the Olympic Sports Complex in Minsk, Belarus. It was the second time the event was held as part of the European Games archery programme. A total of 48 archers from 32 different nations entered the competition, with a maximum of three entries per country. The event offered one qualifying spot for the women's individual event at the 2020 Summer Olympics for any archer reaching the semi-finals from a nation that had not already qualified. The defending champion, Karina Winter of Germany, did not take part following her retirement from the sport.\nGabriela Bayardo of the Netherlands set a new Games record in the ranking round for total number of points scored from 72 arrows. Tatiana Andreoli defeated Lucilla Boari in an all-Italian final, securing their nation's third and fourth archery medals of the 2019 European Games. Bayardo defeated Russia's Anna Balsukova to win the bronze medal and secure the available qualification for the Olympics the following year, the first for a Dutch female archer since 1996.\nBackground.\nQualification.\nA total of 48 places were available for the event. As host nation, Belarus received automatic qualification of three of its archers. Qualification for the remaining positions took place principally through the European Outdoor Archery Championship held in Legnica, Poland in August and September 2018, and the European Grand Prix event held in April 2019. Five 'Universality' places were additionally determined by the European Olympic Committee and World Archery Europe to add representation from National Olympic Committees that otherwise would have not qualified.\nFormat.\nThe event was an outdoor target archery event using recurve bows. Held under the World Archery-approved rules, archers shot at a 122 cm-wide target from a distance of 70 metres, each arrow being awarded between one and ten points depending on how close it landed to the centre of the target. The competition consisted of three stages: an initial ranking round, five elimination rounds, and two finals matches deciding the medal placings. In the ranking round, each of the 48 archers entering the competition shot a total of 72 arrows. The total score of each archer was used to seed the archers into the following five-round single-elimination tournament, the highest-scoring archer receiving the number one seed. If two or more archers finished with the same total score, the number of arrows shot in the central 10-ring on the target was used as a tie-breaker. If two or more archers were still tied, then the number of arrows shot within the inner-10 ring determined the finishing positions.\nThe elimination rounds used the Archery Olympic Round set system used in international recurve archery events since 2010. Each match consisted of a maximum of five sets, with archers each shooting three arrows per set, alternating one arrow at a time. The archer with the best score from their three arrows won the set, earning two points. The archer with the lowest score in each set received zero points. If the score was tied, each archer received one point. The first archer to six points was declared the winner. If the match was tied 5-5 after the maximum 5 sets were played, a single tie-breaker arrow was used with the closest to centre of the target winning.\nReport.\nRanking and elimination rounds.\nMichelle Kroppen and Lisa Unruh of Germany, Ksenia Perova of Russia, and Yasemin Anagoz of Turkey entered as the highest ranked archers in the World Archery rankings, Kroppen holding the highest position at world number five.\nThe ranking round took place in the afternoon of 21 August, the opening day of the Games. Gabriela Bayardo topped the table with a new European Games record of 666 points, beating the previous record set by Unruh in 2015 by four points. The German trio of Kroppen, Unruh, and Elena Richter were forced to borrow bows from other competitors for the ranking round as their equipment had not arrived at the Olympic Sports Complex from the airport. Shooting with an unfamiliar bow is considered a disadvantage, and Unruh stated that they had one hour to learn the new bows before the competition commenced. As a result, the German Shooting and Archery Federation commented that the three entered the elimination rounds from a weaker starting position, with the 1/16 elimination round seeing both Unruh meeting top seed Bayardo and Kroppen and Richter facing off in an all-German tie. Bayardo and Kroppen both emerged victorious to advance to the 1/8 elimination round, Kroppen stating afterwards that \"[i]t's always a stupid feeling when you have to compete against a teammate very early... [o]f course it annoys me to send a teammate out of the race. I think this match was one of the hardest\".\nThe two medalists from the 2015 European Games contesting the event, Maja Jager of Denmark and Alicia Marín of Spain, each failed to progress far into the tournament. Jager, the silver medalist from 2015, was disappointed with her finish in the ranking round - her 20th place was described by Danish news agency \"Ritzau\" as a \"modest\" result - the Dane conceding afterwards that she struggled with the wind as well as her focus in the first half of the round. With 2015 bronze medalist Marín seeded 13th, Jager's win in the opening round meant the two met in the 1/16 elimination round, a repeat of their semi-final match in Baku four years previously. Jager again emerged victorious with Marín struggling to maintain her form from the ranking round. Jager was however eliminated in the following round by Inna Stepanova of Russia in a close match which saw the two tie scores in each of the five sets they played, Stepanova edging out Jager in the subsequent one-arrow shoot-off eight points to seven. With the elimination of Jager's teammates Anne Laursen and Randi Degn in the 1/32 round and the quarter-finals respectively, Denmark's participation in the event ended with them failing to add to their bronze medal victory in the women's team event.\nThe progression of Italians Tatiana Andreoli and Lucilla Boari to the gold medal final was considered a surprise by \"OA Sports\" after the pair had underperformed in the women's team recurve event as well as the 2019 World Archery Championships held earlier that month. Twelfth seed Andreoli shot strongly to defeat fifth seed Audrey Adiceom of France, fourth seed Stepanova, and top seed Bayardo in succession to reach the final, holding out in a double arrow shoot-off against the Frenchwoman and then recovering to come from behind to beat Stepanova in the quarter-finals. Boari meanwhile unexpectedly triumphed against Kroppen in the 1/8 elimination round before seeing off the third-seed Belarusian Karyna Kazlouskaya on her way to the semi-finals. The semi-final encounters, beginning at midday on 26 June, saw Andreoli capitalise on what \"OA Sports\" described as a \"mediocre\" display by Bayardo to win in four sets, while Boari delivered a comprehensive straight sets victory against Russia's Anna Balsukova to set up an all-Italian final.\nMedal matches.\nAs the two losing archers from the semi-finals, Bayardo and Balsukova met to contest the bronze medal match. Bayardo won the encounter in a convincing manner in four sets, admitting that she underperformed in the semi-final against Andreoli due to receiving the news that she successfully qualified a spot for the Netherlands at the 2020 Summer Olympics. It had been more than two decades since the last Dutch female participation at an Olympic archery event, when Lyudmila Arzhannikova and Christel Verstegen competed at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Following her bronze medal win Bayardo reflected that \"I was really excited. I wanted to cry. I was really happy. It was just a mix of emotions... [t]he time was too short and I needed to shoot, and I couldn’t handle that.”\nThe gold medal final featuring Andreoli and Boari was the first all-Italian final played at such a high level in international archery. The pair both started the match strongly, Andreoli scoring two consecutive 10s to take the first set before Boari held her nerve to tie the second set at 28-28. Andreoli however showed greater consistency over the next two sets, and with Boari faltering by shooting three sevens in her final six arrows, Andreoli shot a pair of 26 scores to wrap up the match and take the gold medal.\nThe victory was Andreoli's first individual medal triumph at a senior competition, while Boari's silver was her second medal of the Games after winning gold with Mauro Nespoli in the mixed team recurve three days earlier. Erik Nicolaysen of \"OA Sports\" considered the gold and silver medal successes for the Italian pair as a partial redemption of their poor performances leading into the event. He also wrote that despite her loss, Boari's runner-up finish was an encouraging sign for future events. Boari nevertheless conceded that she had shot poorly, and Andreoli admitted that her personal target ahead of the competition had been to just reach the quarter-finals. She however attributed her victory to the accommodating conditions and her ability to find the right frame of mind, describing it as \"the perfect day\".\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the existing world, European and Games records were as follows:\nThe following new records were set:\nResults.\nRanking round.\n Advanced to 1/16 elimination round \n Advanced to 1/32 elimination round\nElimination rounds.\nSection 4.\n "

        "text": "The Survivor Series match is a professional wrestling tag team elimination match held in WWE. The match typically sees two teams pitted against each other and members of the teams are eliminated one-by-one until one entire team is eliminated. Members of the winning team are deemed the \"survivors\", and in some cases, there may only be one survivor. Although the matches typically see four or five people per team, there have been as many as 10 on a team, and as few as one on a team in a pre-stipulated handicap situation. The match is typically held at WWE's annual Survivor Series pay-per-view and livestreaming event with only the 1998, 2002, , and events not including the namesake match.\nThrough the 2021 Survivor Series, there have been 89 Survivor Series matches, of which only eight have included women. The shortest match was a 1-versus-4 match which saw Big Show eliminate Big Boss Man, Mideon, Prince Albert, and Viscera in 1:26. The 2016 event saw the only Survivor Series match to last over 50 minutes. While the match typically has two teams against each other, the 2019 event had two Survivor Series matches, one for the men and women each, in which three teams went against each other.\nHistory.\nIn 2001 following WWF's acquisition of World Championship Wrestling, the Survivor Series match featured WWF against The Alliance. During 2003 and 2004 with the WWE brand extension, the event saw each Raw and SmackDown having their own match. In 2005 and 2008, there was only one match which saw Raw against SmackDown. However, 2016, 2017, and 2018 saw the Raw against SmackDown format return, with one men's, one men's tag team (except 2017), and one women's match. The 2019 event introduced three-way Survivor Series matches for both men and women with the addition of the NXT brand (along with its sister brand, NXT UK) in addition to both the Raw and SmackDown brands.\n2008 featured the first women's Survivor Series match, since 1995. After several years of no women's Survivor Series matches, in 2013, there was the third woman's match. 2014 featured an additional women's match. Every event since 2016 has featured a women's match."

He made his MLB debut in 2021.\nCareer.\nMinor leagues.\nGil signed with the Minnesota Twins as an international free agent in 2015 for a $90,000 signing bonus. He made his professional debut that season with the Dominican Summer League Twins, going 1–2 with a 4.63 ERA over innings. After not pitching in 2016, he spent 2017 with the Dominican Summer League Twins, pitching to a 0–2 record with a 2.59 ERA over 14 starts.\nOn March 16, 2018, the Twins traded Gil to the New York Yankees for Jake Cave. He spent the season with the Pulaski Yankees and Staten Island Yankees, compiling a combined 2–3 record and 1.96 ERA over 12 starts, striking out 68 over 46 innings.

        "text": "Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition is a 2000 golf video game developed and published by Microsoft for Microsoft Windows. It is the final game in the \"Microsoft Golf\" series, and the successor to \"Microsoft Golf 1999 Edition\". It uses the same game engine as \"Links LS 2000\" (1999), part of Microsoft's \"Links\" series of golf games.\n\"Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition\" was marketed as a basic golf game with limited features, intended for casual players and beginners. It received \"mixed or average reviews\" according to Metacritic, with some praise going towards the game's graphics and high resolution. Some critics noted similarities between the game and \"Links LS 2000\", and believed that it would appeal to its target demographic.\nGameplay.\n\"Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition\" is similar to \"Links LS 2000\", and features seven courses, most of which are already featured in previous \"Links\" games and add-on disks. Courses include Bighorn in California; Bountiful Golf Club and Entrada at Snow Canyon, both in Utah; Kapalua Plantation and Mauna Kea, both in Hawaii; Sea Island Golf Club in Georgia; and the fictional Three Canyons red rock course. Courses include varying obstacles and conditions relating to wind, fog, and cloud coverage.\n\"Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition\" features ten game modes, five of which are absent from \"Links LS 2000\". Modes include match, Nassau, scramble, skins, and stroke. The game also offered multiplayer through MSN Gaming Zone. The game includes three playable golf characters, and more can be custom-made by the player. The game has three swing methods, including Easy Swing and PowerStroke, both previously featured in \"Links LS 2000\". The PowerStroke uses computer mouse motion to simulate the swing. The game includes commentary in response to golf shots. The player can take mulligans and gimmes, and can utilize various camera angles to aid in golfing. Grid lines can be placed on the course to aid in putting.\nDevelopment and release.\n\"Microsoft Golf 2001\" was developed and published by Microsoft, which owned the rights to the \"Links\" series. \"Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition\" uses the same game engine as the 1999 game \"Links LS 2000\". In North America, \"Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition\" was released for Microsoft Windows on August 24, 2000. It was marketed as a basic golf game with limited features, intended for casual players and beginners.\nReception.\n\"Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition\" received \"mixed or average reviews\" according to Metacritic. Some critics viewed \"Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition\" as a basic version of the \"Links\" games; several noted similarities between the game and \"Links LS 2000\" in particular. Kevin Rice of Daily Radar considered it a \"continuation of \"Links LS 2000\" with very minor changes,\" but stated that this was \"not really a bad thing\". Brett Todd of \"Computer Games Magazine\" called the game \"really nothing more than a repackaged \"Links LS 2000\" offered at a bargain basement price,\" while stating that this \"is both good and bad.\"\nCritics considered the game a good value at $20, and believed it would appeal to its target demographic of casual players, rather than hardcore golfers. Considering its low price, Todd believed the game could have appeal for some people, but not for most, stating that nearly all of its good points had been eclipsed by other golf games. Stephen Poole of GameSpot called the game an \"attractive package\" for its variety of terrain and \"excellent\" course design.\nSome praise went to the graphics and the high resolution. Shawn Nicholls of AllGame considered the courses to be \"blatantly artificial\", and \"inconsistent\" with the appearance of the golfer, while Gordon Goble of Gamecenter felt that the golfer characters could have been better animated. Sports Gaming Network considered the graphics to be good, but dated. Nicholls praised the sound, commentary, and music, while Scott Steinberg of IGN criticized the commentary for occurring a few seconds too soon or too late in reaction to golf shots. Michael Lafferty of GameZone was disappointed by how limited the commentary was, and Poole stated that the commentary was \"delivered as if the speaker had just finished walking 27 holes.\"\nDespite a few minor deficiencies, Lafferty praised \"Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition\" for its simple gameplay and called it \"the golf game that will enable families to play together and give the newer players a chance to succeed.\" Rice considered the game to be realistic, while Nicholls stated that computer golfers expecting a realistic and challenging experience would be disappointed by the game. Steinberg stated that lifelong golfers should stick to the \"Links\" games, as \"Microsoft Golf 2001 Edition\" \"lacks serious challenge.\" Steinberg called the game \"a lot more user friendly and less intimidating for newly baptized proponents of the sport.\" Sports Gaming Network criticized the lack of an off-line tournament mode, a feature that was present in \"Links LS 2000\". Todd considered the game to be dated, but also \"good in a 1997-98 sort of way,\" while calling it a \"reasonably deep simulation of golf.\"\nSome criticized the grid lines for being difficult and unhelpful. The PowerStroke swing method was also criticized. Nicholls stated that the game seemed \"impossible and frustrating\" when using the PowerStroke, and Sports Gaming Network considered the PowerStroke awkward to use. Goble criticized the PowerStroke icon's location onscreen: \"It is, for some wacky reason, located right at the base of the screen, in almost exactly the same spot where the game's hidden menu panel is activated. We cannot count the number of times we accidentally triggered that menu when all we wanted to do was make a damn shot.\""

        "text": "The 2021 FIA World Endurance Championship was the ninth season of the FIA World Endurance Championship, an auto racing series organised by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO). The series is open to prototype and grand tourer-style racing cars divided into four categories. World Championship titles were awarded to the leading manufacturers and drivers in both the prototype and grand tourer divisions.\nThe 2021 championship was due to see a significant overhaul of the technical regulations in the top class of competition. The LMP1 Prototypes used in the top class for the first eight years of the championship had been phased out and replaced by a new prototype specification known as Le Mans Hypercars (LMH). However, non-hybrid LMP1 cars were permitted to be \"grandfathered\" into the season.\nThe 2021 championship also marked the return to an annual calendar for the World Endurance Championship, switching back to a summer calendar after the late running of the previous season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCalendar.\nA calendar was revealed in December 2019 at the 8 Hours of Bahrain. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the previous season was extended into November 2020. However, the 2021 season will return to an annual calendar entirely instead of a winter calendar. A calendar for the 2021 season was announced during the 2020 24 Hours of Le Mans event. The calendar featured six rounds as opposed to eight and saw the removal of the 6 Hours of Silverstone, 6 Hours of Shanghai and Lone Star Le Mans when compared with the 2019–20 calendar as well as the addition of the 6 Hours of Monza. The decision to run a six-round series was made to save on costs due to the financial impact of the pandemic. The 1000 Miles of Sebring was initially scheduled for 19 March 2021 as the first round of the season, but was cancelled in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and replaced by a race of the same length at Portimão on 4 April 2021. That same race would also be itself later postponed to 13 June, making Spa the site of the preseason Prologue and the first race of the season. The 24 Hours of Le Mans was originally scheduled to be run on the 12 and 13 June but was later postponed until 21–22 August for an increased chance of running the race with spectators. The 6 Hours of Fuji was cancelled due to ongoing travel restrictions in Japan, and was replaced by a 6-hour event in Bahrain.\nRegulation changes.\nThe championship introduced the Le Mans Hypercar category as a replacement for the Le Mans Prototype 1 class. Manufacturers are free to build and enter bespoke designs without homologation requirement or cars based on existing road-going models subject to a homologation requirement of building at least twenty road-legal models over a two-year period. The cars have a minimum weight of , and power output is capped at in order to achieve a benchmark lap time of three minutes and thirty seconds at the Circuit de la Sarthe. Hybrid energy-recovery systems are allowed on the front axle only, and cars can derive up to of their total power output from those systems. A Balance of Performance system modelled on the system used by the GTE class is applied to ensure parity between hybrid and non-hybrid models. Manufacturers are given greater freedoms in designing the bodywork of Hypercars compared to Le Mans Prototypes provided that bodywork styling does not affect safety standards. LMP2 cars received a power decrease of 40 horsepower, to 560 horsepower, in order to maintain the performance gap between the new top class and LMP2. A specification tyre was introduced in LMP2, produced by Goodyear, ending the tyre war between Goodyear and Michelin.\nEntries.\nToyota announced plans to enter the championship under the Hypercar regulations with a bespoke car based on the GR Super Sport Concept. Toyota launched their GR010 Hybrid on 15 January 2021. In June 2020, boutique car manufacturer Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus committed to a two-car effort with the Glickenhaus 007 LMH, in partnership with 1989 24 Hours of Le Mans winners Sauber Motorsport, 15-time Le Mans winners Joest Racing, and engine specialists Pipo Moteurs. At the 2020 24 Hours of Le Mans, LMP1 competitors ByKolles Racing Team committed to a hypercar programme with its own car, the PMC Project LMH, but the team were not present on the entry list announced ahead of the 2021 season. Aston Martin initially planned to enter a car based on the Valkyrie road-going model. However, the British manufacturer later decided to put its Le Mans Hypercar program on hold. Long-time LMP1 privateer team Rebellion Racing will end its racing operations at the end of the 2019–20 season, despite having previously announced the joint development of a Hypercar with Peugeot. Peugeot itself has announce plans to compete from 2022 onwards, and announced Ligier Automotive as a partner in its project. Alpine announced that it will enter the championship using a single rebadged Rebellion R13 LMP1, run by Signatech Alpine. In LMGTE Pro, Aston Martin Racing ended its factory GTE Pro program run by Prodrive to focus on their Formula One team and their LMGTE Am program.\nLMP2.\nIn accordance with the 2017 LMP2 regulations, all cars in the LMP2 class will use the Gibson GK428 V8 engine. Entries in the LMP2 Pro-Am Cup, set aside for teams with a Bronze-rated driver in their line-up, are denoted with Icons.\nResults and standings.\nRace results.\nThe highest finishing competitor entered in the World Endurance Championship is listed below. Invitational entries may have finished ahead of WEC competitors in individual races.\nDrivers' championships.\nFive titles are offered to drivers, two with world championship status. The Hypercar World Endurance Drivers' Championship is reserved for Hypercar drivers while the GTE World Endurance Drivers' Championship is available for drivers in the LMGTE categories. FIA Endurance Trophies are awarded in LMP2, in LMP2 Pro/Am and in LMGTE Am.\nEntries were required to complete the timed race as well as to complete 70% of the overall winning car's race distance in order to earn championship points.

        "title": "1973–74 Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1973–74 Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey season was the 53rd season of play for the program, the 16th in the Big Ten and 15th in the WCHA. The Golden Gophers represented the University of Minnesota and were coached by Herb Brooks in his 2nd season. The Golden Gophers defeated Michigan Tech 4–2 in the NCAA championship game to win the program's first national championship.\nSeason.\nStumbling Out of the Gate.\nAfter a poor year in his first season as head coach, hopes were high for Herb Brooks in year two. In 1973 the NCAA had finally cracked down on teams importing over-aged players from Canada and had gone so far as to vacate Denver's participation in the national tournament. While the majority of Canadian players who were already on NCAA teams were grandfathered into the new policy and allowed to play, no incoming players were permitted if they had played in any top-tier Canadian Junior League. Because Minnesota's team had been almost exclusively made up of native players for the past two decades the result of the renewed enforcement gave the Golden Gophers an advantage; because they had been actively recruiting players from Minnesota they were the primary destination for the best players in the state. However, because many NCAA teams were still made up of a majority of Canadians this advantage would not yet be realized.\nRegardless of the recruiting practices, Minnesota went into the season looking to recover from a losing season and returned many players from the previous year. Senior netminder Brad Shelstad was named team captain and led the Golden Gophers against an improving Minnesota–Duluth squad in their season opener on the road. Minnesota dropped the contest 3–4 and then headed home to host defending national champion Wisconsin and dropped to 0–3 on the season after losing both games. The Gophers then welcomed another Big Ten rival in Michigan and ended the weekend with an 0–4–1 record.\nRecovery.\nThis was a disaster for the Gophers, who were looking for more out of the young coach, but the next team up for Minnesota was North Dakota, who were in the midst of their second worst season since World War II. The Golden Gophers dominated UND, outscoring the Fighting Sioux 18–6 in the two games. The following weekend Minnesota hit the road and played Michigan State. While the series was closer in score Minnesota once again won both games and pulled their record back to even. The golden Gophers returned home and played their first non-conference games of the season, taking another set of close matches against rising Saint Louis. After a week off Minnesota–Duluth arrived in Minneapolis and the Gophers were able to just finish ahead of the Bulldogs, tying the first game before winning the second.\nAt the end of December Minnesota played in the St. Louis Holiday Tournament. After opening with a win over Harvard, Minnesota faced the Billikens for the third time that season who were able to repay the Gophers with their 6–2 victory, leaving Minnesota as the runner-up. A day after the final Minnesota played the Czech National Team and through they lost the game 1–7 the contest was an exhibition match and did not count towards their record.\n.500 Hockey.\nMinnesota began the second half of their regular season at North Dakota, taking both games to improve to 10–5–2 in the WCHA despite being held to two goals in both games. The Gophers continued their road swing against Minnesota–Duluth and lost both games, a trend that would mostly continue for the next month. After splitting two consecutive series Minnesota faced Wisconsin in mid-February with the Big Ten championship up for grabs. Despite the Gophers' bad start Wisconsin had faltered down the stretch and the two were now tied for the lead. The teams ended up tying both games to finish with identical 5–4–3 records.\nWith only WCHA games left on their schedule Minnesota had plenty of opportunity to finish atop the conference standings but they would need help. On February 14, Minnesota was behind Denver and Michigan Tech with Wisconsin trailing by one point. The Gophers, however, had an advantage in that they still had six conference games to play while Wisconsin had four and Denver had two. Michigan Tech was far in the lead with a 15–5–2 record and six WCHA games to play, but because the conference tournament would crown two co-champions Minnesota could ensure home ice so long as they finished in the top two spots.\nMinnesota's played two series against bottom-feeding teams in Notre Dame and Colorado College, winning three games and tying the other. The seven points put Minnesota firmly in the 2nd spot with 33 points while Michigan Tech being 5 points ahead ensured the Huskies with the Conference title. because the two teams could not meet in the WCHA tournament the regular season finale between the two would be the only meeting other than possibly for the national championship. With both team only playing for pride Michigan Tech used home ice to their advantage and easily defeated the Gophers, outscoring their opponents by 3 goals in each game. The poor end to the regular season, however would not put a damper on Minnesota's playoff hopes as they were set up to host each WCHA playoff round they could reach.\nWCHA Tournament.\nMinnesota met Michigan in the opening round and got off to a good start in the first game, capturing the match 5–1. with a 4-goal advantage for the two-game aggregate series Minnesota had a comfortable lead but that did not stop them from winning the second contest, albeit with a much closer score. In the second round Minnesota welcomed Denver to Minneapolis. The Gopher's victory against the Pioneers in the regular season was their first since 1958 and Minnesota had to beat Denver once again if they wanted to make the NCAA tournament. The two heated rivals fought to a 3–3 tie in the first game leading to a decisive second game where Brad Shelstad held Denver to a single goal and gave Minnesota its third WCHA Tournament championship (shared with Michigan Tech).\nNCAA tournament.\nThe NCAA had altered its classification system in the summer of 1973 making the 1974 tournament the first official Division I championship. The renaming, however, meant nothing as far as any of the teams were concerned. The format and selection remained unchanged and, with their #2 western seed assured, Minnesota faced ECAC champion Boston University. The Terriers had knocked Minnesota out in its last tournament appearance but this time the Gophers were up for the challenge and eked out a narrow 5–4 win. The following night Michigan Tech won their game against Harvard in overtime to match the two WCHA teams in the final. While the Huskies had easily handles Minnesota two weeks earlier, the team had started to show cracks, tying once against the weak Notre Dame team and losing one of their games to Michigan State in the WCHA tournament. Even with the experienced John MacInnes at the helm Michigan Tech wasn't playing particularly well and Minnesota took advantage early. The Gophers outshot MTU 17–11 in the opening frame, with John Sheridan scoring the game's first goal in the 16th minute. John Perpich added a second marker early in the second but the two-goal lead seemed to wake up the Huskies who proved a much stiffer test in the middle period. George Lyle cut the lead in half and sent the match into the third with Minnesota clinging to a narrow margin. The Huskies, however, fell apart in the last 20 minutes, allowing Minnesota to outshoot them 14–3 and score twice more to gain a three-goal edge. High-scoring sophomore Mike Zuke netted MTU's second goal of the game but it came with less than a minute remaining and Minnesota won its first National Title.\nTeam Captain Brad Shelstad was named as the Tournament MOP and found himself on the All-Tournament Team along with teammates Les Auge and Mike Polich. Minnesota had none of its players make the AHCA All-American West Team while Shelstad was the only member of the Gophers to make an All-WCHA Team, earning first-team honors.\nMinnesota had not been expected to compete for a national championship and even after the win Pat Phippen was at a loss for how to explain their surprise title. This was due in part to Minnesota being the first team since Boston College in 1949 to win a championship with a team made up of primarily American players and were one Eric Lockwood game away from playing an entire season with only native Minnesotans. The All-American team was one of the most important wins for USA Hockey as it demonstrated that American players could compete with Canadians and gave professional teams one more reason why they should give US players a chance. The win by Minnesota was felt in the 1974 NHL amateur draft when Minnesota went from have no players taken in either of the previous two years to eight alumni selected in 1974.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | \nPlayers drafted into the NHL/WHA.\n1974 WHA Amateur Draft.\n&lt;br&gt;"

He played for Cronulla-Sutherland in the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) competition.\nPlaying career.\nGardner made his first grade debut for Cronulla in Round 3 1978 against the Parramatta Eels at Cumberland Oval. In 1978, Cronulla finished 2nd on the table and qualified for the finals. Cronulla defeated Manly in the opening week of the finals series 17-12. Cronulla then defeated minor premiers Western Suburbs to reach their second grand final against Manly.\nAfter just 4 games in first grade, Gardner was selected to play in the 1978 NSWRL grand replay to replace Mick Mullane Jr. who was injured in the first final. Just 3 days earlier, Manly and Cronulla played out an 11-11 draw and were required to return and play again on a Tuesday afternoon. Both Manly and Cronulla went into the replay with tired players but it was Manly who prevailed in the replay 16-0 winning their fourth premiership in front of a low crowd of 33,552.\nIn 1979, Cronulla reached the minor semi-final against Canterbury-Bankstown but were defeated 30-15 with Gardner playing at centre. In 1981, Cronulla again reached the finals but once again Manly proved to be their nemesis defeating them 14-11 in the minor preliminary final. In 1983, Gardner finished equal top try scorer in the competition with 17 tries, but Cronulla finished a disappointing 9th on the table. Gardner retired at the end of the 1985 season scoring a total of 44 tries in 128 games.\nCoaching.\nChris was briefly head-coach of Bramley Buffaloes in April 2011."

        "text": "The Japan Under-19 cricket team represents Japan in Under-19 cricket players at the international level. Outside of the ICC full-member nations, under-19 international cricket is generally limited to tournament play, and outside of global events (run by the International Cricket Council), Japan’s involvement has been relatively limited, only dating back to 2007, where they participated in the East Asia-Pacific Regional Under-19 qualifier for the first time.\nHistory.\nThe 2007 East Asia-Pacific Regional Qualifier was Japan’s first involvement in an ICC event at Under-19 level, having become an associate member nation in 2005. This tournament, hosted in Vanuatu, was a qualifier for the 2008 Under 19 World Cup – 31 nations took part in the qualifying tournaments, 5 of which would eventually continue to the tournament proper in Malaysia. Japan lost by 10 wickets after being dismissed for 37 by Papua New Guinea in the opening game of the tournament, by 347 runs to Vanuatu, and then by 387 runs to Fiji. Japan lost the 3rd place playoff by 10 wickets to Fiji, finishing last.\nThe 2009 edition of the tournament expanded to five teams and did not provide direct qualification to the subsequent Under-19 World Cup. Instead, it provided qualification for the top two finishers to the 2009 Under-19 World Cup Qualifier in Canada, which was a pathway to the 2010 Under-19 World Cup, hosted in New Zealand. Japan did not win a game in this tournament, although spinner Raheel Kano was named in the team of the tournament. The 2011 tournament, hosted on Australia’s Sunshine Coast, was notable for Japan’s only victory to date, defeating Fiji by 24 runs.\nJapan did not participate in the East Asia-Pacific regional qualifying tournament again until 2019, participating as hosts, with games held at the Sano International Cricket Ground, also the headquarters of the Japan Cricket Association. Japan defeated Samoa by 174 runs in their first game with Kazumasa Takahashi scoring 68 (92) and taking 4/14. In their second game, a 70 run victory over Vanuatu, captain Marcus Thurgate top scored with 58 (82) and 14-year old legspinner Masato Morita taking 4/38. Their final group game was a 4 wicket win over Fiji, with 15-year old offspinner Yugandar Rethrekar taking 5/18. The final of the tournament was scheduled against 5-time winners Papua New Guinea, before PNG unexpectedly forfeited after 11 players were suspended after a shoplifting incident in Japan, resulting in Japan’s first qualification for a global ICC event.\n2020 Under 19 Cricket World Cup.\nJapan’s first World Cup in any form of the game started with a game against New Zealand in Potchefstroom which was washed out after New Zealand scored 195/2 off 28.5 overs. They were comprehensively beaten by India in their second game in Bloemfountein, being dismissed for 41 before India chased down the target with 45.1 overs remaining. Their final group game against Sri Lanka in Potchefstroom was similar to the second, being dismissed for 43 and conceding the target within 9 overs. Japan lost their playoff quarter-final against England at Potchefstroom by 9 wickets. Japan in their 13th place playoff semi-final against Canada at Ibbies Oval, were dismissed for 118 in pursuit of Canada’s 300/7. Neel Date scored a tournament-high 59 (75) in this game, with eight 4s. Their final game came in the 15th place playoff against Nigeria at Potchefstroom, where they lost by 8 wickets defending 115.\nGrounds.\nThe Sano International Cricket Ground is the only international standard ground in Japan, serving as the headquarters of the Japan Cricket Association. The redevelopment of a turf wicket square in 2016 for the ICC Women’s World T20 Qualifier was funded partially by investment from ICC East Asia-Pacific member federations, Cricket Australia and New Zealand Cricket, and also included a three-lane net facility. One of the playing conditions for higher levels of cricket as recognised by the ICC are natural turf surfaces, which are not readily available in non-cricket playing countries owing to the specialised nature of the infrastructure involved. As such, the development of a turf block in Sano serves as a stepping stone to the hosting of further international cricket in Japan."

A pioneer in several sports disciplines in Argentina, Flores A.C. had played its first match on 19 July 1896, against Buenos Aires F.C.

(developed in cooperation with Magnavox) on September 12, 1975 for 19,000 Japanese yen only in Japan. It was the first video game console ever released in Japan.\nIt released several months before the release of Home Pong in North America. One unique feature of the TV Tennis Electrotennis is that the console is connected wirelessly to a TV, functioning through an UHF antenna. Depending on the source, it sold about 10,000, 20,000 or 3 million units in its lifetime, including about 5,000 units in the first year.\nLegacy.\nThe successor of the TV Tennis Electrotennis is the TV Game System 10 from 1977. It includes as a light gun a plastic replica of a Mauser C96; the C96 replica was also usable with its next console, the Epoch Cassette Vision, created in 1981.\nThe wireless broadcast functionality of the TV Tennis Electrotennis got Nintendo designer Masayuki Uemura to consider adding that capability to the Famicom (Nintendo Entertainment System), though he ultimately did not pursue it to keep system costs low."

        "text": "Valmiera Glass Vidzemes Augstskola (Valmiera Glass ViA, also stylized Valmiera Glass/ViA) is a basketball club based in Valmiera, Latvia, playing in the Latvian–Estonian Basketball League. Originally a student club of Vidzeme University of Applied Sciences (Vidzemes Augstskola), Valmiera started playing in the Latvian Basketball League's third division in 2011, and expanded its roster to include semi-professional and fully professional players. In 2018, the team was promoted to the Latvian–Estonian Basketball League, the newly formed combined top basketball division of Latvia and Estonia, after bankruptcy of the former Latvian champion club Valmiera/Ordo. The head coach of Valmiera Glass ViA is Lithuanian Tomas Keršis.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded in 2009 as the student team of Vidzeme University. It debuted in 2011 in the Latvian Basketball League's Third Division (LBL3) as Vidzemes Augstskola. With Roberts Zeile as player coach and Sandis Amoliņš in roster, the team won the division championship in spring of 2012 and was promoted to the Second Division (LBL2). In 2012, Oto Grīnbergs joined the team and became focal point in team's offence, managing to be leading scorer for next five seasons.\nIn 2014, the team began a partnership with Valmiera Fibreglass and played as \"Vidzemes Augstskola/Valmiera Glass\". It had also established a farm team \"Vidzemes Augstskola/Valmiera Glass-2\" which played in LBL's third division. In 2016, the football club Valmieras FK and the basketball club were brought together under the organization name \" Valmiera Glass / Vidzemes Augstskola\" or \"Valmiera Glass ViA\".\nGradually, the club rose in second division rankings, and made a finals appearance in 2017, where they lost to BK Jelgava. That sparked discussion of Valmiera Glass ViA joining the Latvian Basketball League's highest division. In 2018 Valmiera Glass ViA lost the second division bronze medal series to BK Gulbenes Buki, finishing in fourth place, but due to the bankruptcy of Valmiera city rival club Valmiera/Ordo Valmiera Glass ViA was promoted to newly founded Latvian–Estonian Basketball League.\nBefore the 2018/2019 season, professional Valmiera basketball players Jānis Kaufmanis, Edmunds Elksnis and Māris Ziediņš joined Valmiera Glass ViA. In the regular season, the team's record was 8-20, finishing 12th place overall and 6th among Latvian teams. Although it missed the Latvian-Estonian playoffs, the team qualified for the Latvian LBL playoffs and played in the quarterfinal series against BK Ogre, where they lost the series 0-3.\nIn the summer of 2022, club announced that prominent Latvian national team players and brothers Dairis Bertāns and Dāvis Bertāns have become members of the club board. The club has a strong bond with Bertāns' Basketball School in Valmiera."

The six winners in the play-off round (four from Champions Path, two from League Path) advanced to the group stage, to join the 26 teams that enter in the group stage.\nTimes are CEST (), as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses).\nTeams.\nChampions Path.\nThe Champions Path includes all league champions which do not qualify directly for the group stage, and consists of the following rounds:\nAll teams eliminated from the Champions Path enter the Europa League:\nBelow are the participating teams of the Champions Path (with their 2019 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their starting rounds.\nLeague Path.\nThe League Path includes all league non-champions which do not qualify directly for the group stage, and consists of the following rounds:\nAll teams eliminated from the League Path enter the Europa League:\nBelow are the participating teams of the League Path (with their 2019 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their starting rounds.\nFormat.\nEach tie, apart from the preliminary round, is played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scores more goals on aggregate over the two legs advance to the next round. If the aggregate score is level, the away goals rule is applied, i.e. the team that scores more goals away from home over the two legs advances. If away goals are also equal, then extra time is played. The away goals rule is again applied after extra time, i.e. if there are goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score is still level, the visiting team advances by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals are scored during extra time, the tie is decided by penalty shoot-out. In the preliminary round, where single-match semi-finals and final are hosted by one of the participating teams, if scores are level at the end of normal time, extra time is played, followed by penalty shoot-out if scores remain tied.\nIn the draws for each round, teams are seeded based on their UEFA club coefficients at the beginning of the season, with the teams divided into seeded and unseeded pots containing the same number of teams. A seeded team is drawn against an unseeded team, with the order of legs (or the administrative \"home\" team in the preliminary round matches) in each tie decided by draw. As the identity of the winners of the previous round is not known at the time of the draws, the seeding is carried out under the assumption that the team with the higher coefficient of an undecided tie advances to this round, which means if the team with the lower coefficient is to advance, it simply take the seeding of its opponent. Prior to the draws, UEFA may form \"groups\" in accordance with the principles set by the Club Competitions Committee, but they are purely for convenience of the draw and do not resemble any real groupings in the sense of the competition. Teams from associations with political conflicts as decided by UEFA may not be drawn into the same tie. After the draws, the order of legs of a tie may be reversed by UEFA due to scheduling or venue conflicts.\nSchedule.\nThe schedule is as follows (all draws are held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland).\nPreliminary round.\n&lt;section begin=PR /&gt;\nThe draw for the preliminary round was held on 11 June 2019, 12:00 CEST, to determine the matchups of the semi-finals and the administrative \"home\" team of each semi-final and final.&lt;section end=PR /&gt;\nSeeding.\nA total of four teams were involved in the preliminary round draw.

It was the second final of the international football competition involving the men's national teams of the member associations of UEFA. The match was held on 10 October 2021 at the San Siro in Milan, Italy, and was contested by Spain and France.\nFrance won the match 2–1 for their first UEFA Nations League title.\nVenue.\nThe final was played at the San Siro in Milan, home to Milan and Inter Milan.\nRoute to the final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\"\nPre-match.\nOfficials.\nOn 8 October 2021, the UEFA Referees Committee announced the officiating team for the final, led by 42-year-old English referee Anthony Taylor of the Football Association. He was joined by seven of his compatriots, including assistant referees Gary Beswick and Adam Nunn. Craig Pawson served as the fourth official, while Stuart Burt was selected as the reserve assistant referee. At UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, Stuart Attwell worked as the video assistant referee (VAR) for the match. Chris Kavanagh and Lee Betts were appointed as assistant VAR officials, along with Dutchman Pol van Boekel.\nTaylor has been a FIFA referee since 2013. The match was his third UEFA final as lead referee, having officiated the 2015 UEFA European Under-19 Championship final and the 2020 UEFA Super Cup. He also was selected as a referee at UEFA Euro 2020, where he officiated three matches. He previously served as an additional assistant referee at UEFA Euro 2016, including the final, as well as in the 2015 UEFA Europa League final and 2016 UEFA Champions League Final. Domestically, he officiated the FA Cup final in 2017 and 2020, the Football League Cup final in 2015, and the FA Community Shield in 2015. The final was the fourth time Taylor had refereed Spain (two wins and one loss) and the third for France (one win and one loss).\nTeam selection.\nSpain had all their players available for selection. However, Ferran Torres was a doubt with an ankle issue which required him to be substituted out of Spain's semi-final against Italy and miss Spain's final training session. France had two players missing, after left-back Lucas Digne left the squad due to a muscle injury, while midfielder Adrien Rabiot testing positive for SARS‑CoV‑2.\nBoth teams made two changes to their starting line-ups after their semi-final victories. Spain replaced centre-back Pau Torres with Eric García and midfielder Koke with Rodri, while France replaced centre-back Lucas Hernandez with Presnel Kimpembe and COVID-positive Rabiot with Aurélien Tchouaméni.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nAfter a goalless first half, Mikel Oyarzabal put Spain into the lead after 64 minutes with a low finish from the left to the bottom right corner of the net after a pass from Sergio Busquets which French defender Dayot Upamecano failed to cut out.\nThis goal came seconds after Théo Hernandez shot against the underside of the crossbar for France. Two minutes later Karim Benzema scored to make it 1–1, cutting in from the left to the edge of the penalty area before shooting to the top right corner of the net past Unai Simón who managed to get a touch on the ball but could not prevent it going into the net.\nWith ten minutes remaining Kylian Mbappé got the winning goal when he received the ball from Théo Hernandez before shooting low under the advancing goalkeeper Simón from the left. Mbappé was initially in an offside position from the pass but as the ball was deflected into his path by Eric García he became onside and so the goal was given.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules"

It was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on 28 May 2019 and on 31 July for Microsoft Windows via Steam.\n It was added to Xbox Game Pass on 22 October 2020.\n\"Cricket 19\" is the second Big Ant Studios cricket game released for the Nintendo Switch, the first having been \"Big Bash Boom\".\nGameplay.\n\"Cricket 19\" introduces a new game mode called scenario mode that allows players to begin a match in any predetermined situation.\nThe game also allows users to play through the men's ODI, T20 and test world cups, and women's ODI and T20 world cups. However, these lacked any ICC licenses. Features like match, tour and competition designers are also included which allows the user to format to their needs. The game also features a career mode which allows a player to either start a career as a rookie or play as an existing established cricketer.\nLicensing.\nAustralia, Australia Women, West Indies, West Indies Women, England and England Women are fully licensed with accurate kits and player faces. Australian domestic teams are also fully licensed. \nThe game also includes licensed depictions of all host venues of the 2019 Ashes series - Edgbaston, Lord's, Headingley, Old Trafford, and The Oval. Unlicensed teams include those of India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Despite the lack of licensing, users are able to download these teams as they have been created by other users on the in-game academy. The game also features the 2020 Caribbean Premier League and the 2021 season of The Hundred.\nReception.\nOn the review aggregator Metacritic, the PlayStation 4 version of \"Cricket 19\" received a score of 73 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\"Cricket 19\" received critical praise for improved presentation, features and accurately representing the game of cricket, with IGN scoring it 8/10. However, it did receive some negative comments for glitches, and for being too similar to the previous Big Ant cricket game, \"Ashes Cricket\"."

The tournament was held in Poland and Slovenia from 26 August to 11 September 2022. It was originally planned to be held in Russia. However, due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine starting on 24 February, Russia was stripped of organization rights.\nItaly claimed their fourth title, defeating the reigning world champions Poland in four sets. Brazil won the third place match, defeating Slovenia in four sets. Simone Giannelli from Italy was elected the MVP of the tournament, becoming the first setter to win the award since Vyacheslav Zaytsev in 1982.\nHost selection.\nOn 15 November 2018, at the FIVB Congress in Cancún, Mexico, FIVB initially announced that the tournament would be held in Russia. The tournament was to take place in ten cities (Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Kaliningrad, Yaroslavl, Kazan, Ufa, Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Kemerovo, and Krasnoyarsk).\nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency initially handed Russia a four-year ban from all major sporting events, after RUSADA was found non-compliant for handing over manipulating lab data to investigators. The WADA ruling allowed athletes who were not involved in the doping or the coverup to compete, but prohibited the use of the Russian flag and anthem at major international sporting events. However, the Russia national team could still enter qualification, as the ban only applies to the final tournament to decide the world champions. The ruling was appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which ruled against RUSADA on 17 December 2020, but reduced the ban from four to two years, expiring on 16 December 2022. The CAS ruling also allowed the name \"Russia\" to be displayed on uniforms, as well as the display of Russian colors, if the words \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\" had equal prominence. As Russia already qualified, its players were unable to use their country's name alone, flag or anthem at the championship, as a result of the two-year ban from world championships in any sport. Russia was scheduled to compete as the \"Volleyball Federation of Russia\" (VFR).\nBecause of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Poland, France, Slovenia, as well as the Netherlands threatened to boycott the Championship if Russia were to remain the host. This was confirmed by the Dutch volleyball association on 28 February 2022. Russia was later stripped of its hosting rights on 1 March 2022 due to its invasion.\nAn accelerated bidding process was opened to determine the new host countries for the tournament. It allowed for the possibility that pool phase could be hosted by two or more countries, up to two hosts in the Round of 16 and quarterfinals, and a single host for the semifinals and final.\nOn 15 April 2022, FIVB announced that Poland and Slovenia will host the relocated 2022 Men's World Championship.\nQualification.\nThe current world champions Poland automatically qualified for the competition. The top two teams from each of the 2021 Continental Championships secured qualification. The final 12 places were given to top 12 teams as per FIVB World Ranking who have not yet qualified. After Russia was removed from the competition and new hosts Poland and Slovenia had already qualified, Ukraine has been invited in the competition line up as the next highest ranked team in the World Ranking.\nFormat.\nPreliminary round.\nIn the first round, the 24 teams were spread across six pools of four teams playing in a single round-robin format. The top two teams in each pool and the top four of the third placed teams qualified for the final round. All results of this round combined in a single ranking table to determine a final round pairing and also 17th to 24th rank in final standing.\nFinal round.\nThe qualified teams from preliminary round competed in the knock-out stage.\nIn round of sixteen, the qualified teams matched-up according to the Berger table based on their ranking in the combined ranking table. However, FIVB reserved the first and second position for the host teams if they qualify. The better ranked host team secured the first position, and the worse ranked host team secured the second position. The winners in this round qualified for quarterfinals. The results of this round have combined to preliminary round's combined ranking to determine 9th to 16th rank in final standing. This procedure also applied in quarterfinals to determine 5th to 8th rank in final standing. In semifinals, the winners advanced to compete for the World Championship title. The losers faced each other in the third place match.\nPools composition.\nThe 24 teams were distributed to 6 pools of 4 teams. Teams were seeded in the first position of each pool following the serpentine system according to their FIVB World Ranking as of 20 September 2021. FIVB reserved the right to seed the hosts as head of pool A regardless of the World Ranking. All teams not seeded were drawn to take other available positions in the remaining lines, following the World Ranking.

        "text": "The 1887 Southern Rugby Football Union season was the 14th season of the Sydney Rugby Premiership. This was the fifth competition for the Gardiner Challenge Cup which was awarded to the winners of the premiership. The football season was from May till August 1887. The season culminated in the premiership, which was won by Sydney University who were crowned premiers after winning the first ever final against Arfoma.\nTeams.\nFor the 1887 Gardiner Cup, the Southern Rugby Football Union amended the rules for entry into the competition. It was decided that all clubs within the union had the right to enter after paying the entry fee. Eleven clubs entered the competition and were added to the draw. \nAmongst the names of clubs that folded over the off-season was the name Redfern. The Redfern club had been the premiers only a few seasons prior but had succumbed to internal wars and disagreements. After the draw had been created and the first games underway, Parramatta informed the union that the club was folding.\nThe union declared all games against the now defunct club as null.\nRule changes.\nAt a meeting of the union, the new rules were set for the Gardiner Challenge Cup of 1887. Amendments to the rules from previous seasons included the opening of the competition to all union clubs. It was decided that the teams entered into the competition would be entered into a ballot to determine the draw for the season and that all cup games would be held between 24 May and 1 August. Teams would be ranked according to the number of wins with byes counted as wins. In addition, at the conclusion of these games, the eight clubs with the best record would then be matched in further games to determine the winner of the cup. Later in the season, it was decided at a meeting of the Union to bring forward the finals and not play the final round of games.\nSeason summary.\nThe Sydney University Football Club completed the season without suffering defeat. Every game they played was won with ease, except for their game against Rosedale. The strength of the team was in their forwards with all players excelling at dribbling the ball. Their halfback, Paddy Flynn proved to be quick and accurate with his kicking. Many of the older and more experienced players led the way with performance. The club were considered to be worthy winners of the cup.\nArfoma Football Club displayed great improvement over their performance of the previous season. The club finished as well-deserved runners-up to the University. Hillyar, Hill, Fallick and Ashworth proved to be performing better than ever. The team were fast and nimble. Their only fault was their small stature: weight is a major contributor to success in Rugby Football.\nThe Wallaroo Football Club were unfortunate to suffer a number of injuries during the season that hampered their performance on the field. Chief amongst these was their captain, C Wade, who was considered one of the best players in Sydney. Rather than see the club play short, some of their older players who had retired played a few matches to complete the team.\nBurwood had a successful season losing only their two games against Sydney University. The team boasted quality players such as Percy Chapman (their highly regarded captain), HV Harris (considered one of the best kickers in Sydney) and Samuel Chapman (brother to their captain). Burwood were considered the second best team in the premiership. \nLast seasons premiers, the Gordon Football Club, disappointed many fans of the game. Compared to the previous season the results for the club were very poor winning less than half their games. Questions were being asked as to why they had performed below expectations. The team was still able to boast excellent players and a quality captain in James O'Donnell and the administration of the club was fine. No answer was forthcoming so it was hoped that the club would perform to their previous high standard in the new year. \nFinals.\nA \"finals series\" was held for the first time in 1887. At the conclusion of the main draw of games, which were scheduled to end on 30 July, the top eight ranked teams would proceed to the second round of games. For the next week, the top four teams would remain and then the top two ranked teams would compete for the cup in the third week. At a meeting of the Union it was decided to bring the finals forward to begin on 30 July.\nThe top eight teams qualified for the finals with games decided by ballot. Three games were played on the Agricultural Grounds with approximately 1000 people watching them. University easily defeated Newtown winning 27 to nil. Arfoma won a tight contest against Balmain 4 points to nil. Wallaroo defeated a disappointing Gordon 10 points to nil. On the Ashfield Recreation Reserve Burwood defeated Rosedale 7 to nil. Each of the winners proceeded to week 2 of the finals.\nThe top four teams ranked by wins progressed into the semi-finals. Both games were played on the Agricultural Ground. On the northern field University won a tight contest against Burwood 4 points to nil. On the southern field Arfoma defeated Wallaroo 9 points to nil. Approximately 2000 people were in attendance across both of the games.\nFinal, 13 August.\nThe Final saw Sydney University compete against the young Arfoma club. Atrocious weather kept much of the crowds away with approximately 500 in attendance. Rain turned the ground into a quagmire and a strong wind made it hard to kick accurately. Early in the game, Arfoma unfortunately lost two of their best players to injury. Their opponents sportingly allowed them to draft in two replacements. A close contest saw the scoreline at the end of the first half being 2 points to nil in favour of University. The remaining half saw eventual winners University adding 10 points using the winds at their backs to their advantage. The final score was recorded as 12 points to nil. As a result of this win, Sydney University were declared undefeated premiers.\nLower grades.\nJunior Cup.\nThe Junior Cup was made open for all clubs not participating in the Gardiner Cup. Players who have participated in senior games were not eligible for participating in the Junior Cup. As the cup from the previous year had been won by the Oxford club, a new cup was created and would be given to the winner of the 1887 season. Seventeen clubs entered into the competition for the Atkinson-Price Cup. At the conclusion of the season Double Bay and Elvira competed in the final for the cup. The game was an even contest with no scores made until the final minutes. Elvira won the match and the Atkinson-Price Cup.\nUnion Cup.\nIt was decided that a Union Cup would be offered for all clubs who did not participate in either the Gardiner Cup or the Junior Cup. The rules for the new competition were written and were similar to both the Senior and Junior Cups. Eligible clubs were stretched to include any club who had not completed the MacGregor Cup of 1886 and second teams of existing clubs competing in the other cup competitions. Eleven clubs submitted entries for the competition. At the conclusion of the season Sydney University II and Wallaroo II competed for the Union Cup. University II won the match and the cup.\nRepresentative games.\nIntercolonial matches.\nAt the conclusion of the Gardiner Cup, a New South Wales team was organised to travel to Brisbane to play Queensland in two intercolonial matches. The first match saw a close contest with the accurate boot of Exton giving Queensland the win 9 points to 8. The return match saw another tight contest. Many unsuccessful attempts to kick a goal were made by both teams with the score remaining empty at half time. New South Wales managed to score two tries in the second half to take the win 4 points to 0."

        "title": "1967–68 Denver Pioneers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1967–68 Denver Pioneers men's ice hockey team represented University of Denver in college ice hockey. In its 12th year under head coach Murray Armstrong the team compiled a 28–5–1 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the seventh time. The Pioneers defeated North Dakota 4–0 in the championship game at the Duluth Arena Auditorium in Duluth, Minnesota, the third championship meeting between he two teams. Gerry Powers recorded the first shutout in the championship game and tied the record for lowest tournament goals against average (0.50).\nSeason.\nDenver opened their season looking for revenge against North Dakota who had ended their campaign the year before. After earning a split on the road the Pioneers went east, winning a game against Minnesota–Duluth before continuing onto Houghton to take on perennial power Michigan Tech. The Huskies stymied Denver in both games, holding the Pioneers to single goal in each and putting Denver under .500 both overall and in conference. Denver returned home and began to climb out the hole the following week with a pair of wins over Michigan followed by an easy win over NAIA Bemidji State.\nDenver spent their winter holiday playing in the Broadmoor World Tournament against four different national teams who were gearing up for the 1968 Winter Olympics. Denver went 1–2–1 in the series but acquitted themselves well against strong competition. The experience against the national teams helped the Pioneers go on a streak unparalleled in the history of the program. Denver won two games against the visiting Alberta Golden Bears before returning to their conference schedule and began to run roughshod over the opposition. Denver's offence, which had played well over the first part of the season, exploded after the new year and would score no fewer than 3 goals in their remaining 22 contests. The defense too buckled down and the Gerry Powers would only surrender more than three goals once in their remaining contests.\nDenver would spend the final five weeks of the regular season at home and use that to their advantage by winning 17 straight games to enter the WCHA playoffs as the top seed, having defeated North Dakota and Michigan Tech by a combined 27–6 to guarantee their WCHA championship. Denver opened the conference tournament at home against UMD and dispatched the bulldogs 11–4 before hosting Minnesota in the second round. This was the first meeting between the two all season due to the Gopher's continued refusal to play Denver because of their recruiting conflict but the lack of familiarity didn't hamper Denver in the slightest and the Pioneers won the series 16–3.\nWith another WCHA championship under their belt Denver was given the top western seed in the 1968 NCAA Tournament and opened against Boston College at the Duluth Arena Auditorium. Powers showed up to play in the National Tournament and held BC to a single goal, ensuring that Denver's 4 goals would send the program to its 6th title game. In the final Denver met North Dakota once more and two western powers battled for the championship. Powers and his counterpart Mike Curran both kept the game scoreless through two periods of play but Bob Trembecky broke the tie with a power play marker early in the third. Denver kept its attack going, firing a total of 14 shots in the final frame with three more finding the back of the net, while North Dakota faltered and was unable to score. Denver's 4–0 win was their fourth championship and the first time that any team was shutout in the title game. The win was also Denver 22nd straight victory, a program record both overall and for one season.\nFor tying the NCAA record by allowing only 1 goal in the tournament, Gerry Powers won the tournament MOP and was named to the All-Tournament first team along with Keith Magnuson and Trembecky. Tim Gould, Jim Wiste and Tom Gilmore made the second team. Magnuson and Wiste were named to the AHCA All-American West Team and the All-WCHA First Team while Powers and Cliff Koroll made the All-WCHA Second Team. Magnuson was named as the WCHA Most Valuable Player while Murray Armstrong won his second WCHA Coach of the Year award.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | "

In November 2019, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) swapped the venues for the first and third T20I matches. Ahead of the tour, Chris Gayle confirmed that he would not be playing in the ODIs for the West Indies, after he announced he would be taking a break from cricket.\nFor the first time in international cricket, the International Cricket Council (ICC) announced the use of technology to monitor front-foot no-balls for all matches during the tour. The third umpire called the front-foot no-balls, communicating this with the on-field umpires. It was used as a trial to see if it can be implemented further, without a detriment to the flow of the game.\nIndia won the T20I series 2–1, winning the third and deciding match by 67 runs. India also won the ODI series 2–1, after losing the opening match. It was India's tenth-consecutive win in a bilateral ODI series against the West Indies, going back to May 2006, when the West Indies beat India 4–1 at home.\nSquads.\nAhead of the series, Shikhar Dhawan injured his left leg and was replaced by Sanju Samson in India's T20I squad. Dhawan was later also ruled out of India's ODI squad, and was replaced by Mayank Agarwal. Bhuvneshwar Kumar was also ruled out of India's ODI squad due to injury and was replaced by Shardul Thakur. Navdeep Saini was added to India's squad for the third and final ODI, replacing the injured Deepak Chahar.\nDuring the West Indies' ODI series against Afghanistan in November 2019, Nicholas Pooran was found guilty of ball tampering. He was banned for four T20I matches, therefore missing the three T20I matches against Afghanistan and the first T20I against India."

        "text": "Thomas Anthony \"Kitty\" Gorman (June 9, 1910 – April 8, 1975) was an American college football player and coach. Gorman starred as a prep at St. Philip's in Chicago, Illinois. Gorman played center at University of Notre Dame on the freshman team in 1929 and on the varsity from 1930 to 1933. He was one of the team's two captains in 1933. During the 1933 season, Gorman's father wrote a letter to Notre Dame Vice President John Francis O'Hara, complaining that \"[t]here is something radically wrong\" with Hunk Anderson's coaching, blaming the younger Gorman for losses. Anderson was fired after the 1933 season, the school's first losing season since 1888.\nGorman began his career at Notre Dame playing for famed coach Knute Rockne. James Bacon recounts a story implicating the mob in the Rockne's death that he heard with \"Kitty\" Gorman from Father John Reynolds when Bacon and Gorman were students at Notre Dame.\nAfter his college playing career, Gorman played in the first Chicago College All-Star Game, tying the Chicago Bears.\nCoaching career.\nGorman began his coaching career as an assistant on the freshman team at Notre Dame, while pursuing his law degree. Gorman left Notre Dame to serve as the line coach for former Notre Dame fullback Chet A. Wynne at Kentucky. In 1938, Gorman accepted the line coach position under another former Irish football player, Marchmont Schwartz, at Creighton. Gorman served as the head football coach at Washington University in St. Louis in 1942, compiling a career college football coaching record of 5–5. For the 1942 season, he hired two former Notre Dame players to assist him, Andy Pilney and Bud Kerr.\nGorman accepted commission as a lieutenant in the United States Navy and served in World War II. Washington University did not field a football team from 1943 to 1945 and offered Gorman his head coaching position for 1946 with no guarantee that there would be a season. He turned down the offer, due to disagreements with Chancellor Arthur Holly Compton, who emphasized a focus on education and opposed athletic scholarships. Washington University did not play football in 1946, but the team returned for the 1947 season. Gorman left coaching after the war and began working for General Motors in Chicago."

        "text": "John William Peterson (22 February 1880 – 23 May 1964) was an Ireland men's field hockey international. He was a member of the Ireland team that played at the 1908 Summer Olympics, winning a silver medal. Peterson was one of six brothers who played field hockey for Avoca, Palmerstown and Ireland. His brother, Walter Peterson, also played for Ireland at the 1908 Summer Olympics. Jack and Walter Peterson were also team mates at Monkstown. Peterson also won Irish Senior Cup titles with both Palmerstown and Monkstown.\nEarly years, family and education.\nJack Peterson was born into a Church of Ireland family on 22 February 1880. He was the son of Nicholas George Peterson, a chartered accountant and auditor who was originally from Cork, and Marion Peterson (\"née\" Penny) who was originally from England. Peterson was one of six brothers. He also had a sister, Mary Maud. In 1901 the Peterson family lived at 14 Sydney Parade Avenue in Donnybrook, Dublin. In 1911 they were living at 6 Eaton Place in Blackrock, Dublin. Like his father and two of his brothers, Herbert and Cecil, Peterson worked as an accountant.\nDomestic teams.\nJack Peterson and his five brothers – Walter Peterson, William Peterson, Nicholas Peterson, Herbert Peterson and Cecil Peterson – began playing for Avoca in 1896. In 1899 the brothers moved to Palmerstown. They formed the nucleus of team that between 1900 and 1905 lost only two matches out of 160 played. During this run they won the Irish Senior Cup on four occasions. The two defeats were both cup matches against Dublin University, and both games were lost by a single goal. In one season Palmerstown scored 102 goals and conceded just seven. After Palmerstown disbanded in 1907, most of the brothers, including Jack and Walter moved to Monkstown where he won two more Irish Senior Cup titles in 1911 and 1914. In addition to his five brothers, his team mates at Palmerstown and Monkstown also included J.E. Mills and William Graham.\nIreland international.\nBetween 1901 and 1914 Jack Peterson made 20 senior appearances for Ireland. Peterson played as a left full-back and, for most of his international career, he was partnered at right-back by his brother, Walter Peterson. In 1904 the Peterson brothers were members of the Ireland team that won the Triple Crown. Ireland won the title after defeating Wales 4–2 away and England 3–2 at home. As well as his brother Walter at right-back, the team also included his brothers Nicholas (right-half), William (inside-left) and Cecil (midfield). Another brother, Herbert made two Ireland appearances between 1900 and 1902. In total the brothers won sixty six caps between them. Walter and Jack Peterson were both members of the Ireland team that played at the 1908 Summer Olympics, winning a silver medal. Jack Peterson was not listed in the official 1908 Summer Olympics report. However the Olympic historian, Bill Mallon, lists him as an Olympic competitor."

        "text": "The 2019–20 European Rugby Challenge Cup was the sixth edition of the European Rugby Challenge Cup, an annual second-tier rugby union competition for professional clubs. Including the predecessor competition, the original European Challenge Cup, this was the 24th edition of European club rugby's second-tier competition. Clubs from six European nations competed, including Russian and Italian clubs who qualified via the Continental Shield.\nThe tournament began in November 2019. The final took place on 16 October at the Stade Maurice David in Aix-en-Provence.\nTeams.\n20 teams will qualify for the 2019–20 European Challenge Cup; 18 will qualify from Premiership Rugby, the Pro14 and the Top 14, as a direct result of their domestic league performance, with two qualifying through the 2018–19 Continental Shield. The distribution of teams is:\nNo team from Ireland will participate in the competition as all four clubs have qualified for the 2019-20 European Champions Cup.\nThe following clubs have qualified for the Challenge Cup.\nQualifying competition.\nSix teams were split into two pools of three to compete in the pool stage of the European Rugby Continental Shield. Each team played the other two teams in its pool twice on a home-and-away basis. The winner of each pool faced each other in a two-legged play-off for a place in the Challenge Cup.\nA further place was awarded to the winner of a two-legged playoff between the two sides competing in the 2018–19 Challenge Cup.\nTeam details.\nBelow is the list of coaches, captain and stadiums with their method of qualification for each team.\nSeeding.\nThe 20 competing teams will be seeded and split into four tiers; seeding is based on performance in their respective domestic leagues. Where promotion and relegation is in effect in a league, the promoted team is seeded last, or (if multiple teams are promoted) by performance in the lower competition.\nBased on these seedings, teams are placed into one of the four tiers, with the top-seeded clubs being put in Tier 1. The nature of the tier system means that a draw is needed to allocate two of the three second-seed clubs to Tier 1. The fourth-seed team from the same domestic league as the second-seed team which was put in Tier 2 will also be placed in Tier 2. Brackets show each team's seeding and their league. e.g. \"1 Top 14\" indicates the team was the top seed from the Top 14.\nGiven the nature of the Continental Shield, a competition including developing rugby nations and Italian clubs not competing in the Pro14, the qualifying teams from this competition are automatically included in Tier 4.\nPool stage.\nThe draw took place in June 2019.\nTeams in the same pool will play each other twice, both at home and away in the group stage, that will begin in November 2019, and continue through to January 2020, before the pool winners and three best runners-up progressed to the quarter-finals.\nTeams will be awarded competition points, based on match result. Teams receive four points for a win, two points for a draw, one attacking bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match and one defensive bonus point for losing a match by seven points or fewer.\nIn the event of a tie between two or more teams, the following tie-breakers will be used, as directed by EPCR:\nAttendances.\n\"Does not include the attendance at the final as it takes place at a neutral venue, or the attendances of matches played in empty stadiums due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe.\"\nSeason records.\nTeam.\n66–10 Worcester Warriors at home to Enisei-STM on 11 January 2020\n73–3 Bordeaux Bègles away to Agen on 6 December 2019\n73–3 Bordeaux Bègles away to Agen on 6 December 2019\nBordeaux Bègles away to Agen on 6 December 2019\nBordeaux Bègles away to Agen on 6 December 2019\nDragons at home to Worcester Warriors on 13 December 2019\nLeicester Tigers at home to Cardiff Blues on 12 January 2020\nPlayer.\n Jamie Shillcock for Worcester Warriors away to Enisey-STM on 15 November 2019\n Jonah Holmes for Leicester Tigers at home to Pau on 16 November 2019&lt;br&gt;\n Darcy Graham for Edinburgh at home to Agen on 18 January 2020\n Clovis Lebail for Pau at home to Calvisano on 22 November 2019&lt;br&gt;\n Jamie Shillcock for Worcester Warriors at home to Enisei-STM on 11 January 2020\n Sam Davies for Dragons at home to Worcester Warriors on 13 December 2019\n George Ford for Leicester Tigers at home to Cardiff Blues on 12 January 2020\nAttendances.\nBordeaux Bègles at home to Edinburgh on 11 January 2020\nEnisei-STM at home to Castres on 6 December 2019\nLeicester Tigers\nEnisei-STM"

        "title": "Ice hockey in Finland",
        "text": "Ice hockey is the most popular sport in Finland in terms of television viewership and game attendance figures. It is third most popular sport in participation amongst children. As of 2020, approximately 1.3% of the Finnish population was registered with the International Ice Hockey Federation, ranking Finland second in the world for percentage of population participating in ice hockey and the highest percentage of any country outside of North America.\nHistory.\nIce hockey leagues were first established in Finland in the 1920s. SM-sarja was established as the first national men's ice hockey league in 1928. Viipurin Reipas were champions in the inaugural year and remain one of the oldest ice hockey teams in Finland, still competing today under the name Lahti Pelicans.\nFinland's first ice hockey rink, Hakametsä, was founded in January 1965 in Tampere.\nGoverning body.\nThe Finnish Ice Hockey Association () is the national board for ice hockey in the country and has been instrumental in producing many world class ice hockey players.\nSince 2011, the association has operated a financial support system for minor and junior ice hockey players from low-income families. In 2021, 975 players qualified for grants ranging from 700 to 1,300 euros, determined by player age level. In total, the program has distributed approximately 6.7 million euros to youth hockey players since 2011.\nNational teams.\nAs of May 2022, Finland is the first in the IIHF World Rankings for men's and third for women's national team programs.\nFinland men's national ice hockey team is one of the major powers in world hockey; they won their third World Championship in 2019. The men's national team is a member of the so-called \"Big Six\" an unofficial group of the top men's national teams in world hockey. At the 2022 Winter Olympics, the Finnish hockey team won at the Men's tournament Olympic gold for the first time.\nFinland women's national ice hockey team is recognized as one of the few national teams able to challenge American and Canadian dominance in the highest levels of women's international hockey. The team took silver at the World Championship in 2019 after a controversial loss to the United States in the finals. Though they did not claim gold, multiple Finnish players received awards in the 2019 tournament; team captain Jenni Hiirikoski was awarded MVP and Best Defenceman, Noora Räty was awarded Best Goaltender, and forward Michelle Karvinen was named to the All-Star Team along with Hiirikoski and Räty.\nDomestic leagues.\nMen's leagues.\nFinland has five men's and three women's high-level leagues. The SM-liiga is the elite league for men's ice hockey in Finland. It was created 1975 as the first domestic professional ice hockey league and replaced the SM-sarja as the top national division. The Liiga is a closed league and is run by the independent Jääkiekkon SM-liiga Oy, making it the only Finnish league not operated by the Finnish Ice Hockey Association. The SM-liiga is a closed league; teams are fixed and promotion and relegation are not used. The second- and third-highest men's ice hockey leagues in Finland are the Mestis and the Suomi-sarja; many Mestis and Suomi-sarja teams serve as farm teams to Liiga clubs. Promotion and relegation between the Mestis and Suomi-sarja is possible each season. The lower-level men's leagues play within regional divisions and are the fourth-tier II-divisioona or 2. divisioona, the fifth-tier III-divisioona or 3. divisioona, and the sixth-tier IV-divisioona or 4. divisioona.\nWomen's leagues.\nThe national women's leagues in Finland are the Naisten Liiga (called \"Jääkiekon naisten SM-sarja\" or \"Naisten SM-sarja\" before 2017), the second-tier Naisten Mestis, and the third-tier Naisten Suomi-sarja. The Naisten Liiga is the elite league for women's ice hockey in Finland; established in 1982 and has been in continuous operation since the 1982–83 season.\nThe Naisten Liiga season begins with ten teams in a 20-game preliminary series to determine rank, followed by an upper-divisional series played by the top six ranked teams and a lower-divisional series played by the four lowest ranked teams and the two best teams from the Naisten Mestis cross-qualifiers. At the end of the season, the four teams with the lowest point totals in the lower division of the Naisten Liiga play a promotion/relegation series for placement in the league for the following season; only two teams will remain in the Naisten Liiga, the other teams begin the following season in the Naisten Mestis.\nEvery women's team, with the exception of the ten teams in the Naisten Liiga, begins the season in the Naisten Mestis qualifiers. The teams are sorted into groups and play a fifteen or sixteen-game series intra-group series. The top team or teams from each group proceed to the Naisten Mestis cross-qualifiers for a chance to gain mid-season promotion to the Naisten Liiga and all other teams continue in the Naisten Suomi-sarja regular season. After the Naisten Mestis cross-qualifiers, the teams that did not gain promotion to the Naisten Liiga proceed to the Naisten Mestis regular season. It is possible for a newly created team to gain promotion to the Naisten Liiga in the span of their inaugural season, as Stadin Gimmat (HIFK Naiset) did in 2018–19.\nJunior leagues.\nNational men's junior ice hockey leagues exists at the under-16 (U16, previously \"C-nuoret\"), under-18 (U18, previously \"B-nuoret\"), and under-20 (U20, previously \"A-nuoret\") age groups. Each age group has the same three-tier structure as the senior leagues, i.e. there is a top-level SM-sarja, a second-tier Mestis, and a third-tier Suomi-sarja for U16, U18, and U20. The teams of the U20 SM-sarja differ from those in the other junior leagues because nearly all of them are managed directly by the SM-liiga club, rather than by the affiliated junior club. For example, TPS U20 is operated by HC TPS Turku Oy, the limited company which owns the SM-liiga team HC TPS, but all other TPS junior and minor team are organized by TPS Juniorijääkiekko ry, an affiliated but distinct non-profit organization.\nIt is common for a club to have multiple teams in each age group and, though less common, a single club may have more than one team competing in the same league. For example, during the 2019–20 season, Kärpät U18 competed in the U18 SM-sarja while both Kärpät U18 Akatemia and Kärpät U18 Team played in the U20 Mestis. 'Team' or \"akatemia\", meaning 'academy,' are often used to denote a given team is not the club's top-tier team of its age group, as are the number 2 or the numerals II. Some clubs use novel nomenclature to distinguish their teams, like Kiekko-Espoo U18 Blues and Kiekko-Espoo U18 Challenger, both of which played in the 2019–20 U18 Mestis season.\nCollege ice hockey.\nSeveral Finnish college ice hockey teams have participated in the lower divisions of men's ice hockey before, but in 2023 a college ice hockey league of 17 teams called the FCAA Hockey was established. The first games were followed by over 1 400 spectators."

        "title": "1971–72 Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1971–72 Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey team represented Boston University in college ice hockey. In its 10th year under head coach Jack Kelley the team compiled a 26–4–1 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the eighth time. The Terriers defeated Cornell 4–0 in the championship game at the Boston Garden in Boston, Massachusetts to win their second consecutive national championship.\nSeason.\nFast start.\nComing on the heels of their first national championship, Boston University opened their season in a brand new home rink, the Walter Brown Arena. The Terriers would no longer have to share their home ice with Northeastern and christened their new home with a win over Yale. BU visited Brown for their next game and shut out the opposition for the first of four times on the season. The Terriers returned home and escaped with a narrow 2–1 win over New Hampshire then welcomed Harvard four days later and the two Boston powerhouses fought to a 4–4 draw. The Terriers rounded out the first part of the schedule with a pair of wins, the first at Princeton and then home against Ohio, the only ever meeting between the two schools.\nHoliday Tournaments.\nWith the Boston Arena Christmas Tournament now retired, BU signed on to play in both the ECAC Christmas Tournament and the Syracuse Invitational over their winter break. In the ECAC series Boston University opened against Northeastern and downed the hapless Huskies 4–1 to advance. The Terriers then faced Rensselaer in the final and dominated the competition to get their second shutout on the season and capture the tournament crown.\nJust before the first of the year the Terriers headed to Syracuse and took on Minnesota for a rematch of the previous year's national championship. The Gophers put up a much better fight and the two squads fought to a 3–3 tie after 60 minutes. Because this was a tournament game, however, the two teams would continue until someone scored the deciding goal. In the end it was the Terriers who came out victorious and earned the right to face Cornell for the championship. From the start it was apparent that BU was the better team but even with the Terriers outshooting the Big Red 12–5 it was Cornell who scored first. A power play goal mid-way through the second allowed BU to the tie the game followed by a second marker 4 minutes later. BU continued to out chance their opponent but Dan Brady faltered n the third and allowed two goals on only six shots while Dave Elenbaas shut the door on Kelley's boys to take the championship and improve to 7–0 on the season.\nThe loss to Cornell was only a minor setback for the Terriers but they had already suffered a big loss when after an exhibition game against the US Olympic Team co-starting goalie Tim Regan was lured away to play for the national team. With the Terriers still had the starter from the previous year's championship team in Brady, the duo had split the BU net for the previous two seasons and the Terriers were entering uncharted waters.\nLife Without Regan.\nThe Terriers returned to their regular season with an easy game against College Division Merrimack then hit the road to take on Clarkson, and were soundly beaten by the Golden Knights 2–6. BU rebounded the next night against St. Lawrence before returning home to take on cross-town nemesis Boston College. After defeating the Eagles BU welcomed in two College Division opponents and despite receiving a tough game from eventual ECAC 2 champion Massachusetts, the Terriers were in the midst of a win streak.\nAfter wins at Providence and home against Saint Louis Regan returned to the team. In his agreement to play for the national team head coach Murray Williamson would allow Regan to return to BU if Regan was not going to be the starter for the team at the Olympics. When the team decided to stick with Mike Curran and Peter Sears Regan left in the middle of the games to rejoin the Terriers, but with the squad streaking Dan Brady remained in goal.\nBeanpot.\nBoston University opened the 20th Beanpot with a 4–2 win over BC in the semifinal and, after a narrow victory over New Hampshire, the tournament concluded with the Terriers taking down Harvard 4–1 for their seventh title.\nAfter running their win streak to 11 games the third meeting with Boston College ended with a loss and the worst defensive performance all season. The loss was even more damaging for BU since it meant that Cornell, who had lost three conference games since the earlier meeting of the two teams, was now in a virtual tie with the Terriers for the top spot in the ECAC tournament. After winning at home against Providence BU ended their season with a rematch against the Big Red. While Cornell still had one more game to play after the meeting, if the Terriers won the game they would guarantee themselves the ECAC championship.\nThe Big Red opened the scoring once more and, after BU tied the game, Cornell extended their lead to two with goals early in the second and third period. Brady played much better in the second meeting and allowed Boston University to close the gap with a power play marker mid-way through the third but Elenbaas shut the door the rest of the way and Cornell won the ECAC championship.\nECAC tournament.\nBU entered the tournament as the second seed and met Rensselaer in the first round. As they had the year before the Terriers easily dispatched the Engineers to advance to the semifinal round at the Boston Garden. Boston University faced Harvard for the third time and finally, after five years of trying, BU was able to return to the ECAC championship game with a 3–1 win. In their way stood only Cornell and this time the Terriers were ready. BU were the ones who started the scoring, getting a goal past Elenbaas less than 90 seconds into the contest and again with under three to play in the first. The BU defense helped Brady by limiting the Big Red to only 5 shots in the opening frame. Cornell was able to cut the lead in half late in the second period but BU reestablished their 2-goal advantage less than two minutes later. The Terriers increased their lead early in the third while Brady shut all further opportunities down and the Terriers won their first ECAC tournament championship.\nNCAA tournament.\nBU was looking to become the first eastern team to defend its national championship but their efforts were dealt a tremendous blow just two days before the championship began when Dan Brady was felled by a knee injury. Regan, who had played only spot duty over the previous six weeks, was the Terriers' only hope of repeating and when they faced Wisconsin in the semifinal things looked bleak early. Regan allowed Wisconsin to score a soft goal early in the game but after the rude welcome the Terriers buckled down and insulated their netminder while he got skating legs under him. Once Regan recovered his form the Terriers were able to go on the offensive and score the next four goals to skate away with the win.\nIn the final game BU was once again pitted against Cornell but after being one of the few teams that could beat the Big Red in the past five years, BU was not afraid of the Ithaca powerhouse. Cornell got off to a good start and outshot the Terriers in the first but an ill-advised penalty from Gordon McCormick gave BU their first power play of the game and Ron Anderson capitalized. The game remained that way for over 20 minutes before BU potted their second man-advantage marker, this time from Ric Jordan. All of this was happening while Cornell continued to pepper Regan with shots but none could find the back of the net. Another Anderson goal came before the two-minute mark of the third and the game appeared to be slipping away from the Big Red. Jordan's second goal with 7 minutes left gave the Terriers a near-insurmountable lead and though they were playing for pride at this point, the Terriers still could not score a goal and Regan earned the shutout to give BU the national championship.\nTim Regan tied the record for lowest GAA in the tournament (Ken Dryden and Gerry Powers) with a 0.50 mark and was the obvious choice for Tournament MOP. Regan was joined on the All-Tournament Team by Bob Brown, Ric Jordan and John Danby. Brown, Danby and Brady were named to the AHCA All-American East Team and, while Danby and Jordan ended up on the All-ECAC Hockey Second Team, Ric Jordan made the Second Team. Brown and Brady made the first team. Bob Brown, after tying for the team lead in scoring, received the ECAC Hockey Player of the Year, the first Terrier so honored.\nJack Kelley had announced before the final that he was retiring from college hockey and his team did not fail to give him the send-off he deserved. Kelley's squad was the first (and only as of 2019) eastern team to defend it's championship and though his immediate replacement would turn out disastrously for BU, assistant coach Jack Parker would eventually assume the reins and lead the team for 40 years.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "The 2019–20 Rugby Pro D2 was the second-level French rugby union club competition, behind the Top 14, for the 2019–20 season. It ran alongside the 2019–20 Top 14 competition; both competitions are operated by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR).\nPlaying was suspended after the 23rd Matchday due to the COVID-19 pandemic in France. The season was officially cancelled without any promotion or relegation on 6 May.\nTeams.\nChanges in the lineup from 2018–19 were:\nCompetition format.\nThe regular season uses a double round-robin format, in which each team plays the others home and away.\nThe LNR uses a slightly different bonus points system from that used in most other rugby competitions. It trialled a new system in 2007–08 explicitly designed to prevent a losing team from earning more than one bonus point in a match, a system that also made it impossible for either team to earn a bonus point in a drawn match. LNR chose to continue with this system for subsequent seasons.\nFrance's bonus point system operates as follows:\nStarting with the 2017–18 season, Pro D2 conducts a play-off system identical to the one currently used in Top 14, with the top six teams qualifying for the play-offs and the top two teams receiving byes into the semi-finals. The winner of the play-offs earns the league championship and automatic promotion to the next season's Top 14; the runner-up enters a play-off with the second-from-bottom Top 14 team, with the winner of that play-off taking up the final place in Top 14.\nThis replaced the previous system in which the top team at the end of the regular season was declared champion, also earning a Top 14 place, while the second- through fifth-place teams competed in promotion play-offs. The play-off semi-finals were played at the home ground of the higher-ranked team. The final was then played on neutral ground, and the winner earned the second ticket to the next Top 14.\nPromotion.\nPro D2 to Top 14.\nAs noted above, both promotion places will be determined by play-offs from 2017–18 forward, with the winner of the Pro D2 play-offs earning promotion and the runner-up playing the second-from-bottom Top 14 team for the next season's final Top 14 place.\nFédérale 1 to Pro D2.\nAt the same time, LNR and the French Rugby Federation (FFR) changed the promotion process from Fédérale 1 to Pro D2. For three seasons (2017–18 to 2019–20), only one team will be promoted to Pro D2 through the Fédérale 1 competition. The second promotion place will be a \"wild card\" granted by LNR to a club that meets the following criteria:\nStarting with the 2020–21 season, LNR will create a third professional league, slotting between Pro D2 and Fédérale 1 in the league system.\nRelegation.\nNormally, the teams that finish in 15th and 16th places in the table are relegated to Fédérale 1 at the end of the season. In certain circumstances, \"financial reasons\" may cause a higher-placed team to be demoted instead, or bar a Fédérale 1 team from promotion.\nLeading scorers.\nNote: Flags to the left of player names indicate national team as has been defined under World Rugby eligibility rules, or primary nationality for players who have not yet earned international senior caps. Players may hold one or more non-WR nationalities."

English went on to become Lansdowne's club president during the 1989–90 season.\nHis career with native province Munster saw English play against touring teams from Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Internationally, English first played for Ireland in 1958, replacing Jack Kyle as the teams fly-half. In his 16 caps for his country, English scored 9 points, all from drop goals. In 1959, English won selection for the British Lions tour to Australia and New Zealand, and he played against Queensland and East Coast/Poverty Bay, though injury cut short his tour and prevented him from earning any test caps. English won his final cap for Ireland in December 1963.\nIn recognition of his contributions to Irish rugby, the Rugby Writers of Ireland inducted English into the Hall of Fame in 2008. English died on 27 April 2010 and was survived by his wife, Pauline, daughter Michelle and sons Conor and John."

        "title": "Pentagram (esports)",
        "text": "Pentagram was a Japanese professional esports organization based in Tokyo. It was originally known as Rampage from its creation in September 2012 until its rebranding on 10 January 2018. The organization had a \"League of Legends\" team that participated in the League of Legends Japan League (LJL), the top level of professional \"League of Legends\" in Japan, and a \"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds\" team that competed in domestic tournaments.\n\"League of Legends\".\nHistory.\nAs Rampage.\nOn 16 December 2015, the organization terminated its contract with its primary sponsor, Ozone Gaming Gear, and dropped \"Ozone\" from its name. Rampage replaced its entire roster in preparation for the 2016 competitive season, signing top laner Shirou \"Paz\" Sasaki, jungler Lee \"Tussle\" Moon-yong, mid laner Hiroki \"Roki\" Yokoo, bot laner Kiichi \"Meron\" Watanabe, and support Jeon \"Dara\" Jeong-hoon. The new roster placed third in the regular season of the 2016 LJL Spring Split and second in playoffs after losing 0–3 to longtime rivals DetonatioN FocusMe (DFM) in the grand finals. Rampage managed to place first in both the regular season and playoffs of the 2016 LJL Summer Split after defeating DFM 3–2 in a close series in the grand finals. This qualified them for the 2016 International Wild Card Qualifier (IWCQ), where they failed to qualify for the 2016 World Championship after losing 0–3 to Beşiktaş.\nTop laner Paz and mid laner Roki were replaced by Shunsuke \"Evi\" Murase and Osamu \"Ramune\" Ozawa respectively prior to start of the 2017 competitive season. Rampage placed second in the regular season and first in playoffs in both the spring and summer splits of the 2017 season, facing DFM in the grand finals both times. The team's spring split victory qualified them for the 2017 Mid-Season Invitational, where they placed last in Group A of the play-in stage with a 1–5 record, and their summer split victory qualified them for the 2017 World Championship, where they placed last in Group D of the play-in stage with a 0–4 record.\nAs Pentagram.\nIt was announced on 10 January 2018 that Rampage had rebranded and renamed to Pentagram. Ramune and YutoriMoyasi remained on the team after the rebranding, while top laner Shirou \"Paz\" Sasaki, jungler Jang \"Once\" Se-yeong, and support Yang \"Gaeng\" Gwang-yu joined to complete PENTAGRAM's inaugural roster. On 5 February 2018, Riot Games Japan announced that PENTAGRAM would be penalized for withholding Dara and Tussle's residency cards. PENTAGRAM was forced to surrender the first game of their first five series in the 2018 LJL Spring Split, while managers Takuya \"Aotaka\" Fujita and Hiroki \"MizuRussian\" Nakamura were suspended from any involvement in the LJL or LJLCS for three competitive months.\nPENTAGRAM finished second in the regular season of the 2018 LJL Spring Split, qualifying for playoffs, where they defeated USG 3–1 and DFM 3–0 in the semifinals and finals respectively to be crowned 2018 LJL Spring champions. This qualified the team for the 2018 Mid-Season Invitational, where they were placed in Group B of the play-in stage, along with Turkish team SuperMassive, Brazilian team KaBuM! e-Sports, and Australian team Dire Wolves. PENTAGRAM finished last in their group (fourth) and in the event overall (fourteenth) with a 1–5 record, only managing to take a single game off the Dire Wolves. After the Mid-Season Invitational, PENTAGRAM was one of three teams that represented the LJL at Rift Rivals 2018.\nPENTAGRAM made no changes to their roster in preparation for the 2018 LJL Summer Split. The team placed third in both the regular season and playoffs. On 30 November 2018, Riot Games Japan announced that it would not offer PENTAGRAM a spot in the upcoming 2019 LJL Spring Split, and that it was looking for other organizations to join the soon-to-be franchised LJL. PENTAGRAM responded to the announcement shortly afterwards, saying that it would disband its \"League of Legends\" division.\nControversy.\nIn December 2017, the team's management allegedly confiscated the residence cards of their two Korean players, Jeon \"Dara\" Jeong-hoon and Lee \"Tussle\" Moon-yong, putting them at risk of a hefty fine and imprisonment. Foreign residents of Japan are required by law to have their residence cards on them at all times, readily available for presentation if requested by law enforcement. Dara accused manager Takuya \"Aotaka\" Fujita of threatening him while his residence card was being held, shouting, \"If you don't leave your [residence] card here, you can't leave the team. This residence card is the property of the team.\" Aotaka's actions outraged the Japanese \"League of Legends\" community, and a subsequent investigation by Riot Games Japan determined that the incident had indeed taken place. As punishment, the team was forced to surrender the first game of their first five series in the 2018 LJL Spring Split, while Aotaka and general manager Hiroki \"MizuRussian\" Nakamura were suspended from any involvement in the LJL or LJLCS for three competitive months. Dara retired from competitive play on 4 May 2018, citing his experience with PENTAGRAM as the primary factor, saying \"I can't play [\"League of Legends\"] without throwing up... My spirit is broken. I am returning to South Korea.\" PENTAGRAM responded shortly after with a statement acknowledging their malpractice of confiscating Dara and Tussle's residence cards but denying that they had threatened the players. The statement was met with a largely negative response from the Japanese \"League of Legends\" community. Dara described the statement as \"untrue\", claiming that the team's management confiscated the residence cards to pressure him and Tussle into leaving the team of their own volition.\n\"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds\".\nFrom June to November 2018, PENTAGRAM sponsored Japanese players poly and kr10, who participated in the first season of the PUBG Japan Series. In February 2019, PENTAGRAM announced a four-man roster consisting of albert, notNoir, Sumoken, and tyapatu. The team competed as PENTAGRAM Revive in PJS Season 2 and finished 12th overall. PENTAGRAM announced the disbandment of its PUBG team on 18 April 2019."

Until 1967, the tournament was known as South American Championship. It is the oldest continental championship in the world.\nMexico are not members of the South American football confederation CONMEBOL, but because CONMEBOL only has ten member associations, guest nations have regularly been invited to participate in the Copa América since 1993. Mexico have been the most regular invitee, competing in ten consecutive Copas from 1993 to 2016. However, they did not play in the 2019 or 2021 editions. In 2024, Mexico qualified for the Copa América via the CONCACAF Nations League.\nMexico have reached the final twice, and finished third on three more occasions. This makes Mexico the most successful invitee by far, and are even ahead of CONMEBOL member Venezuela in the Copa América all-time table.\nRecord by opponent.\nMexico's largest victory at the Copa América was a 6–0 win against Paraguay in 2007.

        "title": "1970–71 Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1970–71 Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey team represented Boston University in college ice hockey. In its 9th year under head coach Jack Kelley the team compiled a 28–2–1 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the seventh time. The Terriers defeated Minnesota 4–2 in the championship game at the Onondaga War Memorial in Syracuse, New York to win the national championship.\nSeason.\nEarly Season.\nAfter a very good season in 1970, BU set their sights firmly on improving over their third place ECAC finish. Jack Kelley's Terriers opened the season in St. Louis, playing the new varsity team for Saint Louis University. Not surprisingly, the experienced easterners dominated the Billikens, winning both games by a combined score of 17–1. The squad returned home for their next contest three days later, defeating Brown soundly before hitting the road again (through not traveling nearly as far away as their first two games). After dropping New Hampshire BU faced Harvard in their first big test on the season and the two teams fought to a 4–4 draw. The Terriers returned to their home rink to take on two non-conference opponents and thoroughly dispatched both. First was College Division Merrimack followed by a down Minnesota team ten days later. BU Shut out both opponents and glided into their winter break with a 6–0–1 record.\nChristmas Tournament.\nAt the end of December BU played host in the Boston Arena Christmas Tournament for the 17th and final time. In the first game the Terriers dropped a good Providence team then beat the independent Notre Dame team 7–3 to claim the championship.\nAfter the calendar changed to 1971, BU welcomed Princeton to the Boston Arena with the second-largest shutout victory in program history (14–0). After travelling across town to defeat arch-rival Boston College the Terriers returned home to face Northeastern on their shared rink. The Huskies were no match for Boston University and Kelley's boys posted their fifth shutout of the season.\nAfter brushing off another College Division program, this time in the form of Bowling Green, BU hosted Dartmouth and trounced the Big Green 13–4, their sixth win by at least 8 goals in only 14 games.\nFirst Blemish.\nIn late January BU left New England for the first time in almost two months to face defending national champion Cornell. Cornell had not lost at home in over four years and, despite their best efforts, the first-place Terriers were unable to end the Big Red's streak, suffering their first loss of the season 1–5. BU took their frustrations out on Providence to begin another winning streak, defeating four conference opponents in quick succession (including second-place Clarkson) to head into the Beanpot narrowly holding onto the top spot in the ECAC.\nBU's first opponent in the Beanpot was a very weak Northeastern team and the match was more or less a repeat of the first meeting between the two with the Terriers winning 12–2. Kelley's team played three games during the two-week break and won all three contests by a 5-goal margin. When the time came for the championship BU was able to hold Harvard to a single goal and won their second consecutive Beanpot.\nECAC Tournament.\nThe Terriers finished their regular season with two more wins, finishing with an 18–1–1 ECAC record while possessing the top offense and #2 defense in the 17-team conference. BU played host to Rensselaer in the conference quarterfinals and won the match easily, 11–0. When the tournament shifted to the Boston Garden BU faced Harvard in the semifinal and disaster struck, for the fourth year in a row the Terriers lost in the conference semis, losing 2–4 to their cross-town rivals. Ordinarily that would have meant that BU would not have an opportunity to make the NCAA tournament but because that was only the Terriers' second loss of the season there was a small chance that the selection committee would choose BU as the second eastern seed. To give them a better shot at the tournament the Terriers would have to defeat Cornell in the third place game.\nCornell got off to a fast start, scoring less than four minutes into the game but BU was able to tie the match in less than two minutes. The two teams exchanged goals three more times before the first period was over and Cornell led 3–2 after one. The Terriers tied the game early in the second and then Cornell got into penalty trouble. BU score two power play goals in a 5-minute span and took a 5–3 lead before Cornell got their own man-advantage marker with three minutes left in the second. BU reestablished the 2-goal margin 33 seconds later but the Big Red were able to cut close the gap with 14 seconds left in the middle frame. After allowing the fifth goal on 31 shots, Kelley pulled starter Dan Brady in favor of Tim Regan and the later responded by putting up a wall in front of the BU net. Cornell fired a further 13 shots in the third period but Regan turned away everything and BU skated to a 6–5 win and a third-place finish in the ECAC tournament, the team's first win over the Big Red in 45 years.\nUnfortunately for BU, Harvard won the ECAC tournament, meaning that the selection committee would be choosing between runner-up Clarkson (28–4–1) and third-place BU (26–2–1). However, with BU having defeated the Golden Knights back on February 5 (the two team's only meeting), and Clarkson having lost to Bowling Green the committee chose to give the Terriers the nod.\nNCAA tournament.\nBoston University returned to the national tournament after 4 years on the outside and faced Denver in the semifinal. BU had lost each of their previous four meetings but this year was different and the Terriers managed to triumph over the western powerhouse 4–2. BU reached the championship for the first time and met Minnesota for the second time that season. The Golden Gophers were the first team to reach the title tilt with a losing record (and remain the only squad to do so as of 2019) and had been relying on strong goaltending from Dennis Erickson from the start of postseason play. BU opened the scoring just past the five-minute mark with a power play goal from team captain Steve Stirling and shortly thereafter a slapshot from Bob Brown caught Erickson in an unprotected part of his knee and injured the goaltender. After an extended pause in the game Erickson remained in the game and continued to play well but allowed another goal before the first had ended and a second goal to Stirling on a breakaway in the middle frame. Brady, the BU starter, faced almost as many shots in the game but looked calm in the net, turning aside the 23 shots he faced through two periods.\nIn the third BU played a much more defensive game and limited Minnesota's chances. The game was beginning to look like another shutout for the terriers until Mike LaGarde was called for holding. While the Terriers managed to kill off the disadvantage the Golden Gophers continued to keep the pressure on and scored 5 seconds after the penalty had expired. With momentum having swung in their direction Minnesota went on the attack but Brady stood tall and kept the put out of the BU net. With just over two minutes remaining BU found themselves on a two-on-one and Ron Anderson was able to give the Terriers a three-goal lead. Dean Blais would score Minnesota's second goal with 16 seconds left in the contest but the game was effectively over and BU won their first national championship.\nDan Brady was named as the Tournament MOP (the first American so honored since Barry Urbanski in 1960) and was named to the All-Tournament Team with Bob Brown, Don Cahoon and Steve Stirling. Both Brown and Stirling were named to the AHCA All-American East Team and were joined by John Danby on the All-ECAC Hockey First Team while Ric Jordan made the Second Team. Brown was also awarded the ECAC Hockey Rookie of the Year, an obvious choice perhaps with Brown having led all defensemen in scoring.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

However, South Africa claimed their fourth title, their first since the inception of the Rugby Championship and their first Southern Hemisphere title since 2009. \nThey became the third team to claim the expanded Southern Hemisphere championship, following New Zealand and Australia.\nBackground.\nThe tournament is operated by SANZAAR and known for sponsorship reasons as \"The Castle Rugby Championship\" in South Africa, \"The Investec Rugby Championship\" in New Zealand, \"The Mitsubishi Estate Rugby Championship\" in Australia, and \"The Personal Rugby Championship\" in Argentina.\nFormat.\nBecause of the 2019 World Cup, the tournament schedule was reduced, as it was in 2015, to each team playing each other once. Australia and Argentina each played two home matches out of the three matches to be played in total. New Zealand and South Africa had one home fixture. As usual, a win earned a team four league points, a draw two league points, and a loss by eight or more points zero league points. A bonus point was earned in one of two ways: by scoring at least three tries more than the opponent in a match, or by losing within seven points. The competition winner was the side with the most points at the end of the tournament.\nOther Cups.\nBecause the Bledisloe Cup is decided in two home-and-away legs, after the end of the shortened Rugby Championship, New Zealand and Australia played for the Bledisloe Cup decider at Eden Park, Auckland, with Australia leading the series 1-0.

It was the ninth Champion of Champions event, the first of which was held in 1978. The tournament featured 16 participants who had won World Snooker events throughout the prior snooker season. In 2019, the Women's World Champion competed at the tournament for the first time. As an invitational event, the Champion of Champions tournament carried no world ranking points.\nRonnie O'Sullivan was the defending champion having defeated Kyren Wilson 10–9 in the final of the 2018 event. O'Sullivan lost 5–6 to Neil Robertson in the semi-finals. Robertson defeated reigning world champion Judd Trump 10–9 in the final to win the championship, having required in the penultimate frame to avoid losing the match. There were 20 century breaks during the tournament, eight of which were made in the final. Mark Allen compiled the highest break of the tournament, a 140, in his semi-final loss to Trump. The tournament's total prize fund was £440,000, the winner receiving £150,000.\nFormat.\nThe Champion of Champions is an invitational snooker tournament, first held in 1978, and annually since 2013. As an invitational event, it does not carry any world ranking points. The 2019 Champion of Champions took place from 4 to 10 November 2019 at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry, England. It featured 16 winners of events from the previous 12 months on the World Snooker Tour. The World Women's Snooker Championship and the World Seniors Championship were added to the list of eligible events for 2019, the winners of these two championships being allowed to participate in the Champion of Champions for the first and second time, respectively, (Steve Davis as reigning World Seniors Champion qualified for the 2014 Champion of Champions). The tournament was organised by Matchroom Sport, broadcast on ITV4 and sponsored by sports betting company ManbetX.\nThe 16 qualifiers were split into four groups of four players; each group competed on a different day, with the group finals (event quarter-finals) played on the same day as the corresponding first-round matches. The two semi-finals were played on separate days – 8 and 9 November – with the final on 10 November. The length of the matches varied throughout the competition, those in the opening round being best-of-7 , group finals and semi-finals best-of-11 frames, and the two-session final played as a best-of-19-frames match. Ronnie O'Sullivan automatically qualified for the event as reigning champion, having defeated Kyren Wilson in the 2018 Champion of Champions final 10–9.\nPrize fund.\nThe event featured a prize fund of |£440,000, an increase of £70,000 over the 2018 Champion of Champions tournament. The winner's prize money was increased from the previous year by £50,000, to £150,000. The breakdown of prize money for the 2019 event was:\nQualification.\nQualification for the 2019 Champion of Champions event was determined by the winners of 26 tournaments over a one-year period, from the 2018 Champion of Champions to the 2019 World Open, thereby including tournaments from both the 2018–19 and 2019–20 snooker seasons. The tournaments were placed into six groups dependent on the size of the event, with the previous year's Champion of Champions and the Triple Crown events listed in the first group, and tournaments in the same group were listed chronologically. The winners of the first 16 tournaments on the list were guaranteed a place in the championship. In the event of any of these players meeting multiple qualification criteria, the winners of subsequent tournaments on the list (in the order shown below) would be offered a place in the Champion of Champions. Judd Trump qualified for the event by winning six of the first 16 tournaments, the most won by any player.\nSummary.\nThe event featured 16 participants, split into four groups of four players. There were eight seeded players, based on the world snooker rankings, and each of the top four seeds was placed into a separate group. As defending champion, Ronnie O'Sullivan was seeded first, world champion Judd Trump second, Mark Selby third and Neil Robertson fourth. Each group was played over the course of a single day as single-elimination, rather than a round-robin competition.\nGroup stages.\nThe championship began on 4 November 2019, with players from group four competing in the first round. The opening match was between Neil Robertson and 2019 Championship League winner Martin Gould. Robertson defeated Gould 4–0, the highest of the match being just 67. In the other group four match, 2019 China Championship winner Shaun Murphy played Reanne Evans, the 2019 World Women's Snooker champion.

        "text": "Tennis Arena is a video game developed by British studio Smart Dog and published by Ubi Soft for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1997-1998. The Saturn version was released only in Japan.\nReception.\nThe PlayStation version held a 63% on the review aggregation website GameRankings, based on four reviews. \"CNET Gamecenter\" gave the game an above-average review. \nMany magazines likened it to a 3D version of \"Pong\" due to the limited control the player has over where the ball goes. Critical responses to this limited control varied. Josh Smith of \"GameSpot\" reasoned that the arbitrary reactions to swinging at the ball and moving the player across the court result in an unfair game, and found the repetitive voice clips annoying, but he concluded, \"Yet, with no obvious strong points, somehow the game manages to be pretty addictive, especially in two-player mode. ... It's simple really. At its core, it's an updated version of Pong, and Pong is fun.\" \"IGN\"s Jay Boor, while agreeing that \"Tennis Arena\" is fun, felt that the shallow and limited control left it with no credibility as a real tennis game. \"Next Generation\" criticized the absence of licensed real-world players, and similarly said that the limited control over the ball makes \"Tennis Arena\" \"an arcade treatment of a sport that ought to be fun and exciting but winds up being mostly boring.\"\nAmong the four-reviewer team for \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", Kelly Rickards said the game is solid but that the arcade-style touches, such as the special shots and the star icons, feel silly and ruined the game for him; John Ricciardi praised it as being intuitive enough for both tennis fans and non-fans; Crispin Boyer said it was enjoyable but considerably compromised by the limited control; and Kraig Kujawa opined that the arcade style touches at once were amusing and undermined the realism of the game. \"GamePro\" praised the core gameplay and goofy arcade touches, but found the controls unnecessarily complicated and the A.I. incompetent, and argued that the game should have used real-world players and tournaments. The reviewer summed up, \"The only PlayStation tennis game worth buying, Arena may still leave gamers wishing for more.\" A quotation of \"GamePro\" referring to \"Tennis Arena\" as the best tennis game on PlayStation was pulled from the context of the review's overall middling assessment and put on the cover of the game's North American release. In 1998, Saturn Power ranked the game 98th on their Top 100 Sega Saturn Games summarizing: \"The best tennis game on the Saturn, but \"Tennis Arena\" has little in the way of competition. It's not a great looking game (or particularly well designed) but it's fun enough with two.\""

        "text": "Andrew Ken Thomas (born January 22, 1999) is an American football offensive tackle for the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Georgia and was selected by the Giants fourth overall in the 2020 NFL draft.\nEarly years.\nThomas attended Pace Academy in Atlanta. Following his high school career, Thomas played at the Army All-American Game. He committed to Georgia on July 10, 2016, choosing the Bulldogs over offers from Alabama, Auburn, Florida and others.\nCollege career.\nThomas started every game at right tackle his true freshman season, earning him a Freshman All-American accolade after the conclusion of the season. Thomas switched to left tackle for his sophomore season. He injured his left ankle playing South Carolina, and didn't play the following game against Middle Tennessee. During the next two games, Thomas worked his way back to full participation, though he was forced to wear a brace after re-injuring the ankle later in the season. After helping to pave the way for 331 rushing yards against Kentucky, Thomas was named the Southeastern Conference (SEC) offensive lineman of the week. He was named a first-team All American and to the first-team All-SEC after the season.\nThomas was also invited to the NCAA Elite Football Synopsium in the winter following his sophomore season; the program helps athletes prepare for the transition from college to the NFL. Before his junior season, Thomas projected out as a potential first-round pick in the 2020 NFL draft if he chose to leave Georgia after his junior year. On December 17, 2019, Thomas announced that he would forgo his senior year and enter the 2020 NFL draft, thus also skipping the 2020 Sugar Bowl.\nProfessional career.\nThomas was selected by the New York Giants with the fourth overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft.\nThomas played left tackle for the first five weeks of his rookie season. Thomas was benched for Matt Peart during their Week 6 match against Washington because he arrived late for a team meeting. He ended up starting the remainder of the season at left tackle.\nThomas entered the 2021 season as the Giants starting left tackle. He suffered an ankle injury in Week 6 and was placed on injured reserve on October 19, 2021. On November 22, 2021, Thomas was activated from injured reserve. The same day, Thomas scored his first career touchdown, a two-yard reception, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the Giants' Week 11 game. In February 2022, Thomas underwent surgery to repair the same left ankle that he had injured earlier in the season.\nOn July 26, 2023, Thomas signed a five–year, $117.5 million contract extension with the Giants. The deal included $67 million guaranteed at signing and set a new NFL record for an offensive lineman."

The final was required to be played due to both clubs finishing on equal points. Balmain went into the halftime break with a 5-0 lead. In the second half, Souths scored a try to bring Balmain's lead back to only 2 points. Despite repeated attacks at the Balmain line, Souths were unable to score another try and lost the grand final which was played in front of a low crowd of 7,000 at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\nThe following season, Souths again finished as runners up only this time there was no need to play in a final as Balmain finished first on the table clear of Souths. In 1918, Moore played 9 games as Souths claimed the premiership finishing first on the table and only losing twice throughout the season. \nMoore retired the following season in 1919.

India's Poonam Yadav made the final XI, with Shafali Verma named as 12th woman The rest of the squad had four players from England (Sciver, Knight, Ecclestone and Shrubsole) and one from South Africa (Wolvaardt)."

        "text": "In the sport of baseball, a loss is a statistic credited to the pitcher of the losing team who allows the run that gives the opposing team the lead with which the game is won (the go-ahead run). The losing pitcher is the pitcher who allows the go-ahead run to reach base for a lead that the winning team never relinquishes. If a pitcher allows a run which gives the opposing team the lead, his team comes back to lead or tie the game, and then the opposing team regains the lead against a subsequent pitcher, the earlier pitcher does not get the loss.\nJohn Coleman holds the record for most losses in a single season, losing 48 games in 1883. Will White (42 in 1880), Larry McKeon (41 in 1884), George Bradley (40 in 1879), and Jim McCormick (40 in 1879) are the only other pitchers to lose more than 40 games in a single season. There has been 50 instances of a pitcher losing more than 30 games in a season, all taking place during the 19th century."

Launched in Trinidad and Tobago in 2014, it is the first ten-over tournament of its kind to be broadcast on national primetime television. \nThe tournament is played in likeness of popular Twenty20 cricket tournaments such as the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Caribbean Premier League (CPL). However, the T10 format involves each team playing an innings consisting of a maximum of 10 overs with individual bowlers allowed a maximum of two overs per innings.\nThe tournament is open to primarily amateur, community based players, with each team being allowed a semi-professional mentor player. The major role of the mentor player is to provide guidance based on their experience playing at a higher level. This player is limited to batting only 3 overs per game.\nAlthough the T10 format has not gained official accreditation by the International Cricket Council (ICC),the T10 format has spread to other cricketing territories and currently represents the shortest form of the game of cricket.\nThe inaugural 2014 tournament consisted of 16 teams competing in four groups of four, with the top team from each group going on to contest the semi-finals.\nCharlieville SameSide went down in the history books as the first ever T10 champions by capturing the 2014 T10 CCL title.\nIn 2015, Romel Nanan of the Cane Farm Cougars became the first player to score a century in the tournament.\nChampions of the T10 CCL include Charlieville SameSide (2014), ValleyLine Smashers (2015) and Mayaro Mavericks (2016 and 2017)."

        "text": "Cycling in Prague is a popular leisure activity and a not so common mode of transport within the capital city of the Czech Republic. However, levels of utility cyclists have been rising recently. In 2018, 2% of people commuted by bike in Prague (4% in summer, less than 2% in winter). As of 2017, there were of protected cycle paths and routes in the city. Also, there are of bike lanes and of specially marked bus lanes that can be used by cyclists.\nHistory.\nPrague was never considered as a bike-friendly city. There were no signs of any cycling infrastructure before WW1. In 1956, the first Copenhagen-style bicycle lanes appeared in Letňany on Letňanská street. The former bike lane is now used as a pedestrian walkway. Cycling infrastructure was usually not part of developing big housing panel house estates such as Jižní Město. The first modern bicycle path in Prague was built in 1986 in Stromovka park. Its intended use was recreational cycling.\nAfter the Velvet Revolution, there was substantial pressure to improve the infrastructure intended to be used by cars. Car traffic in the city doubled in the first five years after 1989. Popularity of leisure cycling also increased, the first city cycle routes were marked by the Czech Tourist Club. In 1993, the Council of Prague approved a plan of constructing 400 km of cycling routes in Prague until 2000. However, only less than half of the planned bicycle routes were completed in 2000. The first critical mass cycling in Prague was held in 1991 with around 80 participants. In 2007, a voluntary association in favor of pedestrians and cyclists, Auto*Mat, was established. Furthermore, there is the magazine called „Prahou na kole\", translated as „Prague by Bike\", which includes an online cycling map.\nIn 2022 Luko bike-friendly cities Global City Index, Prague ranked 73rd of total 90 analyzed metropolises around the world. It was next to Detroit, Istanbul or Cairo.\nBike sharing.\nAs of 2021, there are four bikesharing companies operating in Prague. Most of the Prague bikesharing systems function only seasonally, since winter 2020–2021, Rekola and Nextbike operated in wintertime. The table is showing operators and size of their bicycle fleet as of July 2023. \nBicycles in public transport.\nBike transportation is free on Prague Metro, ferries, Petřín hill funicular, in some trams and buses. In metro, bicycles can be transported on the first and last decks of each subway car. Bicycle on trams is allowed only outside of city center, with time exceptions. If person wants to transport a bike in a Prague train, ticket for oversized luggage is needed. Specific spaces for the bikes are marked on from outside of the train. Only two bus lines allow carrying bicycles, as of 2019, those are lines 147 (to Suchdol) and Airport Express."

        "text": "Rugby San Donà is an Italian rugby union club based in San Donà di Piave, in the Metropolitan City of Venice.\n“Associazione Rugby San Donà” was founded in 1959, by a group of passionate pioneers, and, in the same year affiliated to the Italian Rugby Federation. The first team played in serie A since the 1979-80 season and in 4 times reached the semifinals for the Coppa Italia title. During the years, there were various players who had test caps for the Italy national team, both in the main team and in the youth teams, and several players were also called up in inter-regional and representative teams. Among all the players, some notable players who captained the Italy national team: Adriano Fedrigo, Giancarlo Pivetta and Andrea Sgorlon.\nHistory.\nRugby arrived in San Donà di Piave during the late 1950s by initiative of some students, led by Mario Pacifici and Corrado Teso, who learnt rugby union at the Brandolini College, in Oderzo. After persuading some friends, they founded \"Associazione Rugby San Donà\" debuting officially in the 1960-61 season.\nThe success arrived and after two seasons, the team was promoted to serie B at the end of the 1962-63 season.\nAt the end of the 1975-76 season, the club's stint in serie A, where Rugby San Donà remained for some years, deserving the appreciation of all the rugby union environment, in the various structurations that the top championship had. The first team played four times in Serie A1 final stage for the Scudetto in the 1989–90, 1991–92, 1992–93 and 1995-96 seasons.\nVarious players represented the Italian team: between the most representatives there are the captains: Adriano Fedrigo (41 caps from 1972); Giancarlo Pivetta, prop for Italy between 1979 and 1993 (46 caps for Italy and two World Cup caps: 1987 and 1991, the latter also as captain) and coach of the senior team in the 2004 and 2005 seasons; Andrea Sgorlon (37 caps between 1993 and 1999, a World Cup cap in 1995 and European Champion in the 1995-1997 FIRA Trophy). During the 1992-93 season, South African representative Joël Stransky, who was part of the 1995 World Cup winning team, played for the club, which arrived in the second place at the end of the regular season, arriving at the quarter-finals beating Tarvisium before being defeated by Benetton Treviso in the semifinal during the home and away match with the results being 27-28 and 17-25.\nSan Donà remained in the top division until the early 2000s, when professionalism and the transformation of the top league in Super 10 arrived in the 2001-02 season, the club was relegated in Serie A, where they remained until the 2004-05 season.\n2005 was a year of big changes for Rugby San Donà: the team was relegated to Serie B after the defeat in the last play-off match, which made the club rebuild itself and solidify its bases, variating its composition to the technical staff, in order to dedicate to the feeder team and to revitalise the main team. The \"Amatori\" group was formed, led by numerous young local entrepreneurs, among them some former players, with the precise goal to bring the club back to its old times of glory. Such attentions brought the first results: after only a year in Serie B, l'Amatori Rugby San Donà returned again to compete in the Serie A championship during the 2006-07 season.\nThe 2011-12 Serie A1 season marked San Donà's return in the top series, thanks to the final won in Prato against Fiamme Oro with the 13-9 score, thus, earning the promotion in Eccellenza. From the 2012-13 season, the club changed logo and name to Rugby San Donà, the club stably takes part to the Eccellenza championship under the \"Lafert San Donà\" name, due to sponsorship. During the 2017-18 season, the team arrives fifth in the championship ladder, almost making it to the play-off semifinals, and won the Trofeo Eccellenza in the final against Fiamme Oro with the score 24-0. In the titular team which entered to the pitch at Battaglini in Rovigo, led by the coach Zane Ansell, featuring the Italian representative players Paul Derbyshire, Jaco Erasmus, Andrea Pratichetti, who scored a try, and Matteo Falsaperla, Italy sevens captain.\nNotable players.\nHere are listed some international and domestic-level notable players who played for San Donà: "

        "title": "Mali women's national cricket team",
        "text": "The Mali national women's cricket team is the team that represents Mali in international women's cricket. The team is organised by the Malian Cricket Federation and is nicknamed the \"Lady Eagles of Cricket\" (French: \"Les Aigles Dames de cricket\"). It made its international debut in 2015 and has played in regional tournaments in Africa, but is yet to participate in an International Cricket Council (ICC) pathway event.\nHistory.\nThe Malian Cricket Federation established a national women's programme in March 2014. Captained by Aminata Diamouténé, Mali made its international debut at the inaugural 2015 North West Africa Cricket Council (NWACC) women's tournament held in the Gambia. The team finished fourth behind Sierra Leone, Gambia, and Ghana.\nIn April 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) granted full Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Mali women and other ICC members after 1 July 2018 have the WT20I status.\nThe team was one of four sides to play in the 2019 Kwibuka Women's T20 Tournament at the Gahanga International Cricket Stadium in Rwanda. On 18 June 2019, in their opening match, against hosts Rwanda women, the team was bowled out for just six runs in nine overs. Only one cricketer for Mali, Mariam Samake, scored a run in the match, with nine other players dismissed for a duck. It was the first time an innings of an international cricket match had nine ducks on the scorecard. Rwanda women chased down the target of seven runs in four balls, winning the match by ten wickets. It was the lowest team total in a completed WT20I match.\nIn their next two matches of the tournament, against Tanzania and Uganda, the team were bowled out for eleven and ten runs respectively. Therefore, Mali recorded the three lowest totals in WT20Is in their first three matches on three consecutive days. Uganda scored 314 runs from their twenty overs, recording the highest total in a WT20I match. Mali lost the match by 304 runs, the biggest margin of defeat by runs in a WT20I fixture. Mali went on to lose all of their matches in the tournament, finishing with totals of 6, 11, 10, 30/9, 17 and 14 from the six matches they played. Following the conclusion of the tournament, some cricket statisticians questioned the ICC's decision to grant full international status to all of Mali's matches.\nRecords and statistics.\nInternational Match Summary — Mali Women\n\"Last Updated 23 June 2019\"\nTwenty20 International.\nT20I record versus other nations \n\"Records complete to WT20I #678.
