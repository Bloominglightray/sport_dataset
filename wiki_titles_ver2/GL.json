The tournament was won by the , who defeated the 19–16 in the final at Suncorp Stadium, winning their first Super Rugby AU title, and first Super Rugby competition since 2011.\nThe tournament ran parallel to New Zealand's 2021 Super Rugby Aotearoa season, and Super Rugby Trans-Tasman followed the conclusion of both seasons, a crossover tournament featuring each Australian team playing each New Zealand team once, followed by a final.\nLaw variations.\nThe 2021 season of Super Rugby AU will see changes to kick-offs and restarts, with a free kick awarded if the a kickoff has not taken place 30 seconds following the opposition scoring, a restart is kicked out on the full or if teammates of the kicker are not behind the ball. The free kick will take place at half way. These rules are similar to those that are currently used in Rugby sevens. Also the 'Golden point' law brought in during the 2020 season is tweaked so that full-time will only occur after a try is scored, rather than any form of points. Penalties and drop goals will still count towards the score during extra time, but will not end the game, with play only ending if a try is scored or the 10-minute extra time period ends. All other law changes from the 2020 season will also occur in the 2021 season.\nRound-by-round.\nThe table below shows the progression of all teams throughout the 2021 Super Rugby AU season.

        "text": "Paul Carter (born June 2, 1987) is an American professional basketball player for STB Le Havre of the LNB Pro B. He played college basketball for the Minnesota Golden Gophers and UIC Flames.\nEarly life and high school career.\nCarter was born on June 2, 1987, in Los Angeles, California. His father, Ron, played two seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Los Angeles Lakers and Indiana Pacers. Carter played high school basketball in Los Angeles until he relocated to New Orleans, Louisiana, for his senior season. When Hurricane Katrina hit, he moved again to Arkansas and graduated from Mills High School in Little Rock.\nCollege career.\nCarter was to begin his college basketball career at Connors State College but transferred due to a head coaching change. He instead commenced his career at Missouri State University–West Plains during the 2007–08 season. He debuted with a 1-for-12 shooting performance due to playing with a sports hernia that then sidelined him for a month. Carter averaged 12 points and 9 rebounds in his one season at West Plains. \nCarter was spotted by Minnesota Golden Gophers head coach Tubby Smith while playing at a summer camp in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Carter was so impressed by Smith and the Golden Gophers that he did not make a visit to the campus before he committed to the program. Carter was initially academically ineligible to transfer to Minnesota and practiced alone on the West Plains campus until he passed additional classes prior to the 2008–09 season. He joined the Golden Gophers in August 2008. Carter scored a career-high 22 points in a game against the Indiana Hoosiers on February 10, 2009. He averaged 5.3 points and a team-high 4.5 rebounds per game.\nIn December 2009, Carter began considering a transfer from Minnesota when his younger sister, who lived in Chicago, was diagnosed with osteosarcoma. He wanted to be close to her during her chemotherapy and considered colleges in the Chicago area. Carter and his teammates shaved their heads to honor his sister during a February 19, 2010, game against the Wisconsin Badgers. Carter averaged 6.3 points and 3.7 rebounds per game in his junior season.\nOn May 6, 2010, the UIC Flames announced that Carter had transferred to the program. Smith called Carter \"the heart and soul of our basketball team\" and believed that he would become the leader of the Flames. UIC were granted a hardship waiver that made Carter immediately eligible for the 2010–11 season. He set a new career-high in points with 24 against the Roosevelt Lakers on November 15, 2010, and then matched it six days later during a game against the Rhode Island Rams.

After making their List A debut in the 1974 Gillette Cup the county played once in both the 1976 and 1978 editions of the competition. Minor counties were not a regular feature of List A competitions at the time and Shropshire played 15 matches in the NatWest Trophy between 1983 and 2000 before playing eight matches in the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy between 2001 and 2005.\nThe knock-out nature of the Gillette Cup means that in most competitions Shropshire only played one match, most often against a first-class county. They won six matches during the time they competed in List A competitions, the first win coming against Yorkshire, a first-class county, in the 1984 NatWest Trophy. This was the only time the team was successful against first-class opposition, although the county reached the third round of List A competitions in 2000 and 2002, beating other Minor Counties or Cricket Boards, as well as winning against Ireland in 2000.\nPlayers are listed alphabetically.

The event was based on the original NBA concept, including a slam dunk and a three-point shootout contest and it was broadcast for several seasons in the United States as it featured a great number of American professional players who played in the BBL. The main part of the event was the game between the North and South All-Stars. In the mid-90s it used to be known as the Dairylea Dunkers All-Star Game and in its last editions as NIA All-Star Game.\nBarbados player Nigel Lloyd holds the record with the most All-Star Games with 10 consecutive picks from 1993 until the last one in 2002, the year he retired from professional basketball at the age of 40, after 18 full season in British basketball. The coach with the most appearances is Nick Nurse who holds the record with six, coaching both North and South sides.\nBackground.\nIn 1987 the BBL was founded as a breakaway competition formed by 15 teams who previously competed in the English National League and the Scottish National League following the NBA's franchise system. The purpose of the movement was to professionalise and promote the sport in Great Britain and catch up with the top European leagues like the ACB, the Lega Basket Serie A and the LNB Pro A who had already created the All-Star Game event. Therefore, after a successful first season sponsored by Carlsberg the BBL decided to launch an All-Star Game designed on the NBA pattern.\nHistory.\nMost of the games took place on Northern soil in England, where the crowd interest for basketball was higher. By the first demise of the event, the South led in total wins the North with a 7–6 score. After 2002 were persistent calls from former British basketball players to bring the event back in the last decade. In the beginning the busy schedule of the clubs kept those thoughts away from reality, but the All-Star Game returned in the 2008–09 season and lasted for 3 seasons, featuring now the Great Britain All-Stars against the Rest of the World All Stars game. The slam dunk contest was moved to the BBL Cup final match, during its interval.\nList of games.\nBold: Team that won the game.\nThe new era of All-Star Games.\nIn the 2012–13 season the BBL in collaboration with the Irish league launched a joint All-Star Game featuring the best players from both leagues. The event took place on March 31, 2013. The following 2013–14 season the All-Star Game featured a battle between England and Scotland selects from the BBL."

It is one of the three senior men's clubs in St Andrews, along with The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews and the St Andrews Golf Club. The club was founded in 1902. The club does not own a golf course of its own, and consequently members play on the seven public links courses at the St Andrews Links including the Old Course.\nHistory.\nIn 1821 the Cheape family had bought the St Andrews Links including the Old Course. In 1892 the St Andrews Town Council proposed that they and The Royal and Ancient Golf Club share ownership with a condition was that the course remain open to the public. However, The Royal and Ancient Golf Club negotiated a price with Cheape, and in 1893, they purchased it. The Town Council were not happy with the purchase and pursued a new law in Parliament, which became the St Andrews Links Act 1894, in order to obtain the links for the people of the town.\nThe same men, who fought for the new law were the same men who founded The New Golf Club. During this time, the people of the town had no clubhouse, even though there were at least nine golf clubs in St Andrews. Eight local businessmen established the Club in 1902, with Old Tom Morris being a supporter, having visited the Club regularly. It was in the New Golf clubhouse that he had the accident which would lead to his eventual death.\nMembership.\nThe New Golf Club does not own a golf course of its own, and as a consequence members also need to pay a subscription fee to the St Andrews Links Trust to play on the seven public links courses (the Old, Balgove, Castle, Eden, Jubilee, New, and Strathtyrum golf courses). Members of The New Golf Club can also apply for membership of the St Andrews Thistle Golf Club, along with members of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews and St Andrews Golf Club. In 2019 the total membership of the club was 2,200, this included 1,850 ordinary voting members. The maximum numbers of ordinary voting members is 2,000.\nThe New Golf Club tartan.\nThe St Andrews New Golf Club tartan was produced for the centenary (1902-2002) of the New Club at St Andrews and is restricted to Members of the club. It comes in purple, earth and green.\nHonorary Membership.\nThe New Golf Club has only ever had five Honorary Members in over a century, and never more than one at any one time:"

This was the fifth PGA Championship at Southern Hills and its eighth major championship. The event was originally scheduled to be played at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey, but was moved to Southern Hills following the January 6 United States Capitol attack.\nDefending champion Phil Mickelson withdrew from the tournament amid controversy over his remarks about LIV Golf.

Thomas came from seven shots behind at the start of the final round to win, tying the largest comeback in PGA Championship history. Mito Pereira, the 54-hole leader in his first PGA Championship appearance, led by one shot playing the 72nd hole before hitting his drive into a water hazard and making a double-bogey to finish a shot out of the playoff.\nThis was the first major championship to go to a playoff since the 2017 Masters, a span of 19 consecutive majors, the longest in history.\nThis year's purse was increased 25% to $15 million, with a winner's share of $2.7 million.\nVenue.\nCourse layout\nYardage by round\nSouthern Hills had previously hosted the PGA Championship in 1970, 1982, 1994, and 2007; it also hosted the U.S. Open in 1958, 1977, and 2001.\nField.\nThe field for the PGA Championship is sometimes regarded as the strongest in professional golf, routinely having the highest \"strength of field rating\" of the year according to the Official World Golf Ranking.

Beginning his round on the 10th hole, McIlroy birdied four holes in a row on his first nine and did not make a bogey until the sixth hole, his 15th. He finished the round by making an 18-foot putt for birdie on the ninth, taking the first-round lead at a major championship for the first time since the 2014 Open Championship and first after any round since winning the 2014 PGA Championship.\nHoge made only one bogey to go with five birdies, while Zalatoris birdied three of his first four holes to equal Hoge's four-under 66. 2017 champion Justin Thomas was even-par making the turn after bogeys on holes eight and nine before making three birdies on the back-nine to shoot 67 (−3), the lowest score in the afternoon.\nWorld No. 1 and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler eagled the par-5 fifth hole to go two-under on his round but made four bogeys on the back-nine to finish with a one-over 71. Tiger Woods was two-under through five holes before making seven bogeys the rest of his round, finishing at four-over 74.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, May 20, 2022\"\nWill Zalatoris shot a bogey-free round of 65 (−5) to take a one-shot lead over Mito Pereira at nine-under. Zalatoris birdied three holes in a row on his back-nine to get to eight-under for the tournament. At the par-4 17th hole, after his drive went into the trees to the right of the fairway, Zalatoris hit his approach to seven feet and made the putt for sole possession of the 36-hole lead.\nPereira, playing in just his second major championship and first PGA Championship, was two-under on his round at the turn before making four birdies on his second nine. He had a six-foot birdie putt on the ninth (his 18th) to shoot 63 but missed, settling for a six-under 64 to finish at eight-under.\nPlaying in the more difficult morning conditions, Justin Thomas birdied the ninth (also his 18th) for a second consecutive round of 67 (−3). At six-under for the tournament, he held the lead as he finished his round before being passed by Zalatoris and Pereira in the afternoon.\nBubba Watson made nine birdies in a tournament-record round of 63 (−7), narrowly missing a 22-foot putt on the 18th for the first 62 in PGA Championship history. He was the third player to shoot 63 in a major at Southern Hills, along with Raymond Floyd in 1982 and Tiger Woods in 2007. He finished at five-under and in fourth place.\nOvernight leader Rory McIlroy made two bogeys on the front-nine and didn't make a birdie until the 12th, settling for a one-over 71 to fall back to a tie for fifth place at four-under. Woods, in the same group with McIlroy, double-bogeyed the 11th hole after hitting a chip shot over the green into a bunker to fall to five-over and outside the cutline, but he rebounded with birdies at the 13th and 16th to finish at three-over and make the cut by two shots.\nThe 36-hole cut came at 144 (+4) and better; 79 players advanced to the weekend. Notables to miss the cut included World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, the reigning Masters champion, and two-time major champion Dustin Johnson.\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, May 21, 2022\"\nMito Pereira, in his PGA Championship debut, shot a one-under 69 to take a three-shot lead into the final round. Beginning the round a shot behind Will Zalatoris, Pereira birdied two of his first five holes and opened up as much as a four-shot lead on the front-nine before three consecutive bogeys from holes 8 to 10. \nHe rebounded with a 17-foot birdie putt on the par-5 13th, then hit his approach on the par-3 14th to six feet for another birdie. He finished the round by making a 27-foot putt for birdie on the 18th green to finish at nine-under for the tournament. He became the first player to lead after 54 holes in his tournament debut since John Daly in 1991.\nZalatoris, the overnight leader, bogeyed four holes on his front-nine, including a three-putt on the par-3 sixth hole. He made his first birdie on the round on the 13th, holing a 35-foot putt. After a bogey on the 16th when he could not advance his ball out of the right rough off the tee, he hit his second on the par-4 17th inside four feet for a birdie to climb back to six-under for the tournament, three shots back of Pereira.\nMatt Fitzpatrick and Cameron Young both shot 67 (−3) to climb into contention. Fitzpatrick birdied four of his last 10 holes, including both 17 and 18, to join Zalatoris at six-under and a tie for second place. Young drove the green on the 17th and made a 24-foot putt for eagle to finish at five-under and alone in fourth place.\n2017 champion Justin Thomas began the round in third place but shot 74 (+4) to fall seven shots off the lead at two-under. Two-time champion Rory McIlroy also shot 74, including a triple-bogey at the 11th; he finished at even-par. Bubba Watson was alone in second place while playing the front-nine but went four-over on the back-nine to join a group tied for seventh place at two-under.\nTiger Woods shot a nine-over 79, including a stretch of five bogeys in a row for the first time in his major championship career, before withdrawing from the tournament after the round.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, May 22, 2022\"\nSummary.\nWill Zalatoris, beginning the round three shots behind Mito Pereira, tied the lead with two birdies in his first five holes while Pereira was one-over. Zalatoris made bogey on the par-3 sixth hole after hitting his approach over the green into thick bushes and taking a drop on the cart path, then failed to get up-and-down from a greenside bunker on the seventh for another bogey as Pereira again went three ahead with a birdie at the fifth hole. Pereira bogeyed both the seventh and eighth holes but managed to save par from a bunker on the ninth to make the turn at seven-under, one shot ahead of Zalatoris and Cameron Young.\nZalatoris bogeyed the 12th, while Young tied Pereira at six-under when the leader also bogeyed the hole. Pereira reached the green on the par-5 13th hole in two shots and two-putted for birdie, while Young fell two behind after hitting his tee shot on the par-3 14th into a bunker. Young three-putted for a double-bogey on the 16th and finished the round at four-under following a 71. Pereira's tee shot on the 14th flew over the green and he made another bogey, dropping his lead again to just one shot. Zalatoris also three-putted for bogey on the 16th before holing a seven-foot birdie putt at the 17th to reach five-under.\nWhile the leaders were struggling, Justin Thomas, who began the round seven shots behind, was quickly moving up the leaderboard. He birdied the ninth hole, then made a 64-foot putt from the front of the 11th green for another birdie. He made his second consecutive birdie on the 12th hole to reach four-under, then got up-and-down from a bunker on the short 17th for another birdie that moved him to five-under. At the 18th, he hit his approach to 10 feet but missed the birdie putt, settling for a par and a three-under round of 67.\nZalatoris made an eight-foot par putt on the 18th to tie Thomas for the clubhouse lead at five-under. Leading by one playing the 18th, Pereira hit his drive to the right into a water hazard, found the rough on his third shot, then chipped over the green. He suffered a double-bogey on the hole, dropping down to four-under and a shot out of the playoff.\nPlayoff.\nAfter both Thomas and Zalatoris birdied the par-5 13th hole to begin the playoff, Thomas drove the green on the 17th and two-putted for birdie while Zalatoris settled for par. When Zalatoris missed a lengthy birdie putt on the 18th, Thomas needed only to two-putt for par to win his second major title, both at the PGA Championship.\nThomas' seven-shot comeback after 54 holes tied John Mahaffey in 1978 for largest in PGA Championship history."

        "text": "The Pakistan cricket team toured the West Indies in July and August 2021 to play two Tests and four Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. The Test series was part of the 2021–2023 ICC World Test Championship. The fixtures for the tour were confirmed by Cricket West Indies in May 2021. The T20I series was originally scheduled for five matches. However, this was changed to four T20Is, following the rescheduled One Day International (ODI) fixtures in the West Indies' series against Australia.\nThe T20I series was heavily impacted by rain, with three of the four matches washed out and ending in no results. In the third match, only six minutes of play were possible before the match was called off. The only match to be completed was the second, with Pakistan winning by seven runs. Therefore, Pakistan won the four-match series 1–0.\nThe Test series began with a single-wicket victory by the hosts at Sabina Park, reminiscent of previous tight finishes between the two sides, such as in Antigua in 2000 and in Dominica in 2017. Pakistan won the second Test match by 109 runs, with the series being drawn 1–1.\nSquads.\nOn 18 May 2021, Cricket West Indies named a 18-man provisional squad for the T20I matches, with Kieron Pollard captaining the team. On 24 June 2021, Haider Ali was withdrawn from Pakistan's T20I squad, after breaching the bio-secure bubble at the 2021 Pakistan Super League tournament. Sohaib Maqsood was named as his replacement. Pakistan's Azam Khan suffered a head injury during a training session and was ruled out of the second and third T20Is. Romario Shepherd was added to the West Indies' squad for the second T20I. On 11 August 2021, Mohammad Nawaz and Haris Rauf were both released from Pakistan's Test squad.\nWarm-up match.\nAhead of the Test series, the West Indies played a four-day intra-squad match at Sabina Park in Jamaica.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nAn initially sunny first morning saw Kemar Roach and Jayden Seales dismiss the two Pakistani openers cheaply, but rain brought a halt to proceedings and an early lunch with the visitors on 34/2. West Indies' pace bowlers continued putting the Pakistan batsmen through difficult times after play resumed; removing Azhar Ali and Babar Azam within the space of five deliveries in the middle of an extended afternoon session. Tea came with Pakistan on a score of 123/5, but Fawad Alam and Faheem Ashraf built an 85-run partnership after the interval to bring their side to a more secure position, before Ashraf was run out as the pair attempted an unnecessary single. This effectively prompted a collapse from the tail end as the final five wickets fell for 31 runs in less than an hour.\nThe hosts went in to bat shortly after half past six, but Mohammad Abbas struck in the third over to remove Kieran Powell and Nkrumah Bonner, both for ducks, with successive deliveries. Bad light then brought the first day to a close with West Indies wobbling at 2/2. An overcast second day began with Abbas again questioning the batters with challenging line and length, but once nerves settled down, West Indies navigated to lunch with the loss of only one additional wicket, 81/3, with Kraigg Brathwaite unbeaten on 35. Brathwaite would go on to dominate the day, seeing off the bowlers throughout the next session, with the score 148/5 at the interval, and then marched towards a 96-run partnership with Jason Holder before the latter was dismissed. This was shortly followed by the departure of Brathwaite, run-out three runs shy of a century. Pakistan sought to exploit this opening, but wayward bowling with the new ball let the lower order squeeze out further runs, and a narrow lead, well before the umpires started worrying about light, with West Indies standing on 251/8 at stumps. Bright sunshine greeted the players on the next morning, but Shaheen Afridi quickly struck twice to get the home team's remaining wickets.\nWest Indies again removed one of the openers in quick order, but Azhar and Abid Ali settled for a 55-run second wicket, steadily progressing before Azhar was bowled in the final over before lunch, the visitors 56/2. The period after the resumption saw the home side's best moments of the day, as Seales removed Abid and Alam in quick succession, with Pakistan in a precarious position, four wickets down with a lead of only 29. Mohammad Rizwan and Babar Azam gradually added runs to this total, under darkening skies, which again forced an early interruption for tea, the visitors now at 117/4. After the delay, Rizwan's wicket quickly fell to Holder's bowling, but Azam saw out the day's play, reaching a half century in the company of Faheem Ashraf, the scoreboard reading 160/5. This put West Indies in the position of requiring a strong performance to restrict the chase to a manageable total. This was achieved the following morning with the help of a tight spell by Seales, who become the youngest West Indies bowler to record a five-wicket haul in Test cricket, breaking Alf Valentine's record, with Pakistan's last five wickets falling for 35 runs, 28 of those coming from batting by Hasan Ali.\nThe dramatic session saw three more wickets, the first one of those in a surprising over which saw three reviews for lbw appeals, Kieran Powell finally falling to Afridi's bowling on the third. Brathwaite and Bonner were next, each out for single-figure scores to Afridi. Jermaine Blackwood and Roston Chase successfully limited the damage, with the hosts on 38/3 at the break of play. Faheem Ashraf then put further pressure on the batsmen, getting an edge from Chase and then from Kyle Mayers in his next over, but the more important moments for the visitors came late in the session, with the wickets of Blackwood and Holder reducing the hosts to 114/7, the remaining 54 runs looking like a tall order for the tail. However, as in Antigua in 2000, the lower order stood up to the task, and despite best efforts by Pakistan, including a stunning catch by wicket-keeper Rizwan for the ninth wicket, the score at 151/9, the final pair saw out the remaining 17 required runs, giving the West Indies a single-wicket victory on a see-sawing fourth (and final) day. Seales was named player of the match for his performance with the ball, having taken eight wickets.\n2nd Test.\nThe first overs of the game were a setback for the Pakistan team, as Kemar Roach and Jayden Seales took the first three wickets in short order for only two runs. However, Babar Azam and Fawad Alam built an unbeaten century partnership, bringing Pakistan to 62/3 at lunch and 145/3 at tea. The weather conditions in which the match was played, having previously forced off West Indies wicket-keeper Joshua Da Silva (replaced by the reserve wicket-keeper, Jahmar Hamilton) with cramps, ultimately led to Alam retiring hurt, suffering from the same condition, his stand with Azam still unbeaten on 158. Azam was out later in the final session, caught in the slips off Roach. Mohammad Rizwan and Faheem Ashraf saw off the reminder of the day, under less oppressive weather, with the visitors reaching the close on 212/4, only 74 overs having been bowled before bad light prevented further play. Rain and a consequently wet outfield prevented any play the following day. Damp patches in the bowler's run-up further hampered play the following morning, only eight balls being possible before lunch. On the resumption, things began slowly as Pakistan only scored 6 runs in the first 10 overs. Rizwan and Ashraf would end up with a 50 partnership, but the star of the day was Alam, who, having retired hurt earlier, returned and guided his team through the day's play, on the way to an unbeaten 124, with Pakistan on 273/8 at tea. A declaration a few overs after the interval put the home side in the bat for the rest of the session.\nIdeal bowling conditions put the batsmen immediately on the backfoot, with both openers departing for single figure scores within the first six overs. The wicket of Chase was next to fall, and with deteriorating light, Alzarri Joseph was sent in as nightwatchman, preventing any further damage, the hosts on 39/3 at the close, and the visitors firmly in control. Afridi struck early the next morning, removing Joseph, but Jermaine Blackwood and Nkrumah Bonner put on some resistance before Abbas removed Bonner and then Mayers, who had yet to score in the series. Afridi, on his way to a 6-wicket haul, then had Blackwood out to a short delivery, and West Indies, without any established batters remaining, were 123/8 at lunch. Jason Holder aggressively targeted Abbas' bowling after the break, hitting multiple boundaries, but Afridi eventually struck twice more.\nPakistan then went out to bat, and, recognising that time was in short supply if they were to force a result, brought about 107/3 in the 17 overs that were possible before tea. The evening did not bring any break to the onslaught, as the runs kept tallying up. Another declaration left 90 minutes until the close.\nThe opening partnership, batting cautiously, held up for over an hour, but was undone by Powell being run out. Joseph was brought in as a nightwatchman again, and no further wicket fell until stumps, with the score 49/1. This left Pakistan in need of 9 wickets, and West Indies requiring still 280, with the former looking a far more likely prospect. Joseph and Brathwaite kept the bowlers waiting on the final morning as they made steady progress, but once Afridi had Joseph, Hasan Ali and Nauman Ali combined for a few of the middle order wickets, leaving West Indies 113/5 at lunch. Blackwood and Brathwaite then seemed to get the situation under control, but Nauman removed the former with a well-flighted delivery. A poor shot by Brathwaite then allowed Pakistan to take aim at the lower order, although Mayers put on a stout display, falling to Afridi just before rain brought an early tea, the scoreboard now reading 159/7, the visitors just three wickets from leveling the series. The weather only briefly delayed the match, although West Indies continued resisting, this time with the help of Holder, dismissed by Nauman Ali three runs from a half-century. Afridi took up the new ball shortly thereafter, and, on his way to a ten-wicket haul, quickly worked through the tail to bring victory to his side. He was named player of the match for his bowling."

        "text": "The New Zealand cricket team toured Pakistan in September and October 2021, and were scheduled to play three One Day International (ODI) and five Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. It was New Zealand's first tour of Pakistan since 2003. However, on the morning of the first ODI match, New Zealand Cricket (NZC) raised a security alert with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the Pakistan Government, which resulted in the entire tour being called off.\nIn December 2021, both cricket boards agreed to play a set of extra fixtures in Pakistan in April 2023 to make up for the postponed tour, following New Zealand's tour of Pakistan in December 2022.\nBackground.\nOn 4 August 2021, the PCB confirmed the schedule for the tour. The ODIs were scheduled to take place at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, and the T20Is would have taken place at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. Tom Latham was named as New Zealand's captain, with Kane Williamson being unavailable due to him playing in the rescheduled phase of the 2021 Indian Premier League. After the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in August 2021, several New Zealand players reportedly expressed concerns about touring Pakistan. On 18 August, New Zealand Cricket announced that its players would have the right to pull out of the tour if they \"felt uneasy about touring Pakistan even if the tour went ahead\".\nThe ODI series was originally scheduled to form part of the inaugural 2020–23 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League. However, in September 2021 it was announced that due to the unavailability of the Decision Review System (DRS), the ODI matches would be a standalone bilateral series. The World Cup Super League matches were rescheduled for New Zealand's tour of Pakistan in 2022–23.\nReactions and aftermath.\nNewly-appointed PCB Chairman Ramiz Raja expressed his disappointment on Twitter and said that \"New Zealand will hear us at ICC\". Former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar also reacted on New Zealand's decision to pull out of the series and said \"New Zealand just killed Pakistan cricket\". Pakistan's team captain Babar Azam also took to Twitter to express his displeasure over the cancellation of the series, saying he was \"extremely disappointed\" and stated that he has the full trust in Pakistan's security agencies.\nThe New Zealand cricket board chief executive David White said in a statement that they had no choice but to call off the tour of Pakistan. White later said that \"there was no way we could stay in the country\" following the advice they were given, but also thanked the PCB for their professionalism. Former New Zealand all-rounder Grant Elliott also reacted to the news and said, \"Sad news for players and fans\".\nOn 20 September 2021, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced that both their men's and women's tours to the country in October 2021 had been cancelled, citing issues around wellbeing and concerns of travelling to the region. Australia, which are also scheduled to tour Pakistan in 2022, said that said they are monitoring the situation and will \"talk with the relevant authorities once more information becomes known.\"\nSquads.\nUsman Qadir, Shahnawaz Dahani and Fakhar Zaman were named as travelling reserves in Pakistan's T20I squad. Ahead of the tour Pakistan's Mohammad Nawaz tested positive for COVID-19. Pakistan named a squad of twenty players for the ODI series, with twelve of those being selected for the first match.\nNew Zealand's Tom Blundell was ruled out of the ODI series due to an injury, with Daryl Mitchell named as his replacement."

        "text": "The UEFA European Championship is the primary national association football tournament in Europe. The sixteen completed tournaments have been won by ten national teams: Germany and Spain have each won three titles, France and Italy have each won two titles, and the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece and Portugal have each won one title. The role of the manager is to select the squad for the European Championship and develop the tactics of the team. Pressure is attached to the role due to the significance of winning the competition and the lack of day-to-day contact with players during the regular club season aside from international breaks.\nGavriil Kachalin led the Soviet Union to victory in the inaugural tournament in 1960. No manager has won the title on more than one occasion, and all winning managers have won it with their native countries, with the exception of German coach Otto Rehhagel leading Greece to victory in 2004. Two managers have both won and lost a European Championship final: Helmut Schön (winner in 1972 and runner-up in 1976, both with West Germany) and Berti Vogts (winner in 1996 and runner-up in 1992, both with Germany). Vogts is also the only person to win the European Championship as both a player and a manager, having previously lifted the trophy while playing for West Germany in 1972. Schön and Vicente del Bosque are the only managers to have won the European Championship and World Cup; Schön managed Germany to the 1974 World Cup after winning the European Championship in 1972 and del Bosque led Spain to victory in the 2010 World Cup before winning the European Championship in 2012.\nJosé Villalonga is the youngest manager to win the trophy, he was 44 years and 192 days old when he led Spain to victory in 1964. The oldest manager to win the European Championship is Luis Aragonés, who was 69 years and 336 days old when Spain won in 2008. Joachim Löw and Lars Lagerbäck jointly hold the record for managing at the most European Championships, with both leading teams at four different tournaments; Löw additionally holds the records for most matches managed (21) and most matches won (12) in the competition, all coming between the 2008 and 2020 tournaments."

        "text": "The 2020–21 Bellarmine Knights men's basketball team represented Bellarmine University in the 2020–21 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Knights, led by 16th-year head coach Scott Davenport, played their home games at Freedom Hall in Louisville, Kentucky as members of the ASUN Conference. They finished the season 14–8 and 10–3 in ASUN play to finish in second place in the conference. They earned the second seed in the ASUN tournament, losing in the quarterfinals to Stetson. They were invited to the College Basketball Invitational (the program's first ever Division I postseason event), where they defeated Army in the quarterfinals and lost to Pepperdine in the semifinals.\nThe season marked Bellarmine's first year of a four-year transition period from Division II to Division I. As a result, the Knights were not eligible for NCAA postseason play but were allowed to participate in the ASUN Tournament.\nPrevious season.\nThe Knights finished the 2019–20 season with a 20–8 overall record, including a 13–7 mark in GLVC play to finish in fifth place. It was a turbulent season for the team to say the least. They began the season 14–0, and had earned a number one overall ranking in the Division II Top 25 polls. After falling at home in a heartbreaking overtime loss to Indianapolis, 81–76, the Knights never quite found their dominant footing again. They lost six of their next eight games, including one to annual GLVC bottom feeder William Jewell. With the losing skid, the Knights fell out of the rankings all together and were faced with a tough climb to even make the NCAA Tournament. They won three of their final four games to close out the regular season. As the 5th seed in the 2020 GLVC tournament, they were defeated by No. 4 seeded Southern Indiana in the quarterfinals, 76–73. They received the 5 seed in the Midwest Region of the NCAA DII tournament. But, like many sporting events, the tournament was cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. \nSchedule and results.\nBellarmine was scheduled to begin their season on November 25 on the road against Chattanooga, but due to \"unforeseen circumstances\", this game, along with their home opener on November 28 against Transylvania, and their game on December 1 against Dayton, were postponed. Their game against Chattanooga was rescheduled for December 9, at home, and their game against Transylvania was rescheduled for January 1, 2021. Their game against Dayton was canceled.\nAfter a preseason shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Knights ended up playing their first game at the Division I level on the road against the sixth-ranked Duke Blue Devils. It was a historic night for the program albeit in a quieter than usual Cameron Indoor Stadium. Despite staying close for the first half, Bellarmine ended up falling short to Duke, 76–54. Junior guard Dylan Penn entered the history books during the game, as he was responsible for scoring the first ever points in Bellarmine's history at the Division I level.\nTwo days after the loss to Duke, Bellarmine made a different kind of history for the program, which was undoubtedly more positive. On December 6, 2020, the Knights traveled to the doorsteps of Howard University and dismantled the Bison, 84–63, to notch their first ever win at the Division I level. Sophomore guard Alec Pfriem came off the bench and notched the program's first ever double-double in Division I, scoring 14 points and grabbing 14 rebounds. The double-double was also the first of Pfriem's collegiate career.\nThe Knights entered ASUN play with a 3–3 record, including losses to high-profile ACC opponents in Duke and Notre Dame. After narrowly being swept at home by preseason conference favorite Lipscomb, the Knights got back to playing their brand of basketball. They went on the road and swept Florida Gulf Coast in a dominant two-day set, behind the contributions of senior forward Ethan Claycomb. He was named ASUN Player of the Week, becoming the first Bellarmine athlete in any sport to earn such an honor during the Knights' brief ASUN history.\nThe Knights continued their success at home in the following weekend against Stetson, pulling off comeback wins on back-to-back nights to extend their winning streak to four. The second win was particularly special, however, as the Knights pulled off an unbelievable comeback. Trailing by 20 with less than 19 minutes to go in the game, Bellarmine shot 84 percent from the field in the second half (21 of 25) en route to rallying past the Hatters for a 76–65 victory.\nBellarmine continued their winning streak over the next few weeks, sweeping Kennesaw State, Jacksonville, and North Alabama to get to a 10–2 record in ASUN play, which placed them at the top of the conference.\n!colspan=13 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| ASUN Conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| ASUN tournament\n!colspan=12 style=| CBI\nSource"

        "title": "2021 Overwatch League season",
        "text": "The 2021 Overwatch League season was the fourth season of the Overwatch League (OWL), a professional esports league for the video game \"Overwatch\". The regular season began on April 16, 2021, and concluded on August 21. The season featured four midseason tournaments throughout the regular season along with a new point system for season playoff seeding. Similar to the 2020 season, teams are split into two geographical regions. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most matches were played online, with the exception of several live events throughout the season. The season marks the second year of the Overwatch League's broadcast partnership with YouTube, their third with Sport1, and their first with Bilibili.\nThe postseason began on September 4 with two regional play-in tournaments acting as qualifiers for the season playoffs. The playoffs began on September 21 and culminated with the Grand Finals on September 25. The Shanghai Dragons won the Grand Finals over the Atlanta Reign to win their first OWL championship.\nFormat.\nRegions and live events.\nAfter all matches were rescheduled to be played strictly online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 season saw the OWL divide teams into two regions, North America and Asia, in an effort to reduce lag due to online play. For the 2021 season, the twenty teams were divided into two regions, the East and West. Eight teams from China and South Korea competed in the East Region, while twelve teams from North America and Europe competed in the West Division.\nThe majority of matches in the 2021 season were played online. Three live events were planned to be hosted by three teams in China: Hangzhou Spark in June, Shanghai Dragons in July, and Guangzhou Charge in August. All five China-based teams travelled to these events, while the three Korea-based teams played at the events remotely via the league's cloud server. The Charge's homestand in August was cancelled, however, due to COVID-19 concerns. Additionally, the Dallas Fuel hosted a homestand in July at Esports Stadium Arlington.\nMidseason tournaments.\nThe league expanded upon the tournament format that was introduced in the 2020 season. Four standalone tournaments, the May Melee, June Joust, Summer Showdown, and Countdown Cup, were spread throughout the regular season with teams from both regions competing against each other. Hero pools, a system in which some heroes are unplayable, were used in two of the four tournaments: the June Joust and Countdown Cup. For each tournament, teams played four weeks of regional qualifier matches. The top six teams from the West and the top four teams from the East advanced to regional knockout matches, and the top two teams from each region advanced from the knockouts to play in the interregional tournament. In an effort to minimize lag, the qualifying Western teams traveled to the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa for each interregional tournament. The internet service provider at the University of Hawaii was directly connected to a cloud-based server in Tokyo, Japan via an underwater sea cable, while the qualifying Eastern teams did not travel anywhere and connected to the Tokyo server from Asia. With this setup, the league was able to equal latencies for all participating players with a \"minimum-latency tool\" developed by Activision.\nSeason playoffs.\nContrasted to previous seasons, where playoff seeding was determined by teams' win–loss record throughout the regular season, the league implemented a point system, called League Points, to determine regular season standings. Every win in the regular season earned a team one point. A first-, second-, or third-place finish in each midseason tournament earned the placing team an additional three, two, or one point, respectively. A total of eight teams advanced to the season playoffs: the top three teams from the West and the top two teams from the East, based on League Points, advanced directly to the season playoffs. Seeds four through nine in the Western region and seeds three through five in the Eastern region in the advanced to their respective region's play-in tournament, with two teams from the West and one team from the East advancing to the season playoffs.\nRegular season.\nThe 2021 schedule was released on February 20, 2021, and the regular season began on April 16.\nMay Melee.\nThe May Melee was the first of four midseason tournaments of the season. Qualifiers began on April 16 and concluded on May 1. The regional knockouts began on May 2, and the May Melee tournament between the top two teams from each region began on May 7.\nJune Joust.\nThe June Joust was the second of four midseason tournaments of the season. For the tournament, four heroes were banned from all qualifying and tournament matches: Tracer, Sombra, Reinhardt, and Zenyatta. Qualifiers began on May 21 and concluded on June 5. The regional knockouts began on June 6, and the May Melee tournament between the top two teams from each region began on June 11.\nSummer Showdown.\nThe Summer Showdown was the third of four midseason tournaments of the season. Qualifiers began on June 25 and concluded on July 10. The regional knockouts began on July 11, and the tournament began on July 16.\nCountdown Cup.\nThe Countdown Cup was the last of four midseason tournaments of the season. For the tournament, four heroes were banned from all qualifying and tournament matches: Echo, Ashe, Sigma, and Lúcio. Qualifiers began on July 30 and concluded on August 14. The regional knockouts take place on August 15, and the tournament began on August 19.\nPostseason.\nPlay-in tournaments.\nThe play-in tournaments were two regional single-elimination tournaments that took place September 4–5 and advanced two Western teams and one Eastern team to the season playoffs. In the Western region, seeds four through nine, based on regular season standings, advanced to the Western play-in tournament. The first round was contested by seeds six through nine, with the sixth seed selecting either the eighth or ninth seed as their opponent. The winners of the first round advanced to the finals, with the fourth seed choosing their opponent from the winners of the first round. In the Eastern region, seeds three through five, based on regular season standings, advanced to the Eastern play-in tournament. The fourth and fifth seed competed in the first round, and the winner of the first round faced the third seed in the final. In both regions, the winner of the finals advanced to the season playoffs.\nPlayoffs.\nThe playoffs were a double-elimination tournament contested by eight teams – five from the West region and three from the East region. All matches in season playoffs, aside from the final match, took place from September 21 to 24. The final two teams remaining in the tournament advanced to the Grand Finals, which took place on September 25. Playoff matches, aside from the Grand Finals, were planned to take place live at Esports Stadium Arlington in Arlington, Texas, while the Grand Finals was planned to take place at the Galen Center in Los Angeles, California; however, the OWL announced on August 25, 2021, that all playoff matches, including the Grand Finals, would not be played in a live format due to increasing risks of COVID-19 and the Delta variant. Instead, the West region playoff teams travelled to the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, while the East region teams played in their home country, to minimize latency between competing teams.\nNotable events.\nChinese teams boycott Saebyeolbe.\nOn April 12, 2021, while streaming on Twitch, Seoul Dynasty player Park \"Saebyeolbe\" Jong-ryeol commented about frustration trying to appeal to a Chinese audience while streaming on the Chinese streaming platform DouYu. In an English translation, Park said during his Twitch stream, \"I can't say Taiwan and [Hong Kong]. At all. They (China) don't recognize them as countries. I got into so much trouble for saying their names. Make it make sense. What are you talking about, 'One China?' So I objected to that and all the managers said, 'If you want to earn Chinese money, you have to become a Chinese dog.' So that's what I'm doing right now. I can even say, 'Thanks for subscribing' in Chinese. Aren't I good at Chinese?\"\nTwo days after the comments, Park apologized via a handwritten note on Instagram. Nearly three weeks after the apology, the four Chinese teams of the Overwatch League — the Shanghai Dragons, Chengdu Hunters, Hangzhou Spark, and Guangzhou Charge — announced that they would not participate in any Overwatch League event in which Park was present. On May 6, 2021, the Overwatch League issued a statement announcing that the Chinese teams would no longer be boycotting Park nor the Seoul Dynasty. As of August 18, 2021, Park has not appeared in a match since the incident.\nSoft salary cap investigation.\nIn July 2021, \"Dot Esports\" reported that the Civil Conduct Task Force of the United States Department of Justice antitrust division was investigating whether or not the league's soft salary cap policy violated the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, as the player's are not unionized. The league's soft salary cap per team in 2020 was , and if a team went over that amount, they would have to pay additional money to the league, which would be distributed to other teams. In October 2021, \"Sports Business Journal\" reported that the OWL would be eliminating their competitive balance tax and maximum salary caps.\nLeague sponsorship pulled.\nIn July 2021, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) filed a lawsuit against Activision Blizzard for sexual harassment and discrimination taking place within the Blizzard workplace. Two weeks after the filing, Overwatch League partners Coca-Cola, Kellogg's, State Farm, and T-Mobile announced that they would be reassessing their partnership with the league, and all branding of the aforementioned companies were removed from the league's website. Later, Kellogg's stated they \"will not be moving forward\" with their sponsorship of the Overwatch League. Additionally, \"Sports Business Journal\" observed that IBM branding was removed from all Overwatch League media, including the league's official partners' page and power rankings. In mid-August 2021, the only sponsor present during Overwatch League broadcasts was voice-over-Internet Protocol software company TeamSpeak.\nAwards.\nRole Stars.\nSource:\nMedia.\nThe season marked the second year of the Overwatch League's the three-year broadcast contract with YouTube, which did not include broadcast rights for China. For the 2021 season, YouTube introduced clipping functionality for their videos and allowed OWL games to be rendered in 4K resolution.\nUnder a new, multi-year contract, Bilibili obtained production and broadcast rights in China. Bilibili has a similar deal with Riot Games' \"League of Legends\" international competitions and, prior to the deal with the Overwatch League, secured hosting rights for Overwatch Contenders and Overwatch Open Division in China. Activision Blizzard renewed a deal for TV-exclusive rights to the Overwatch League in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland with Sport1; the multi-year contract was signed after their two-year deal with Sport1 concluded.\nWinnings.\nTeams in the 2021 season competed for a total prize pool of across midseason tournaments and playoffs, with the payout division detailed below."

All of the matches were scheduled to be played at Rawalpindi. It would have been the first time that the England women's team had toured Pakistan. The WT20I fixtures were scheduled to be played as double-header matches alongside the England men's games against Pakistan, with the WODI matches being used as preparation for the 2022 Women's Cricket World Cup. The two teams last played each other in Malaysia in December 2019.\nOn 13 August 2021, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) made a minor change to the tour itinerary, moving the matches from the National Stadium in Karachi to the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium due to logistical reasons. On 24 August 2021, the PCB made another adjustment to the schedule, this time bringing the tour forward by three days.\nOn 17 September 2021, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said they would determine in the next 24 to 48 hours whether they will proceed with the tour or not, after New Zealand cancelled their tour of Pakistan due to a security threat. On 20 September, the ECB announced that the series had been cancelled, citing issues around wellbeing and concerns of travelling to the region. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Rameez Raja expressed his disappointment on Twitter and criticised England for \"failing a member of their cricket fraternity\"."

        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 2021 season was the first time that the league featured a 17-game regular season schedule, and consequently the start of the playoffs was pushed a week later to January 15, 2022. The postseason concluded with Super Bowl LVI on February 13 at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California with the NFC's fourth seed, the Los Angeles Rams, defeating the AFC's fourth seed, the Cincinnati Bengals. The Cincinnati Bengals won their first playoff game since 1990 by defeating the Las Vegas Raiders.\nThis was the first postseason since 2010–11 where neither of the first-seeded teams made it to their respective championships, and was also the first postseason since 2009–10 in which neither Aaron Rodgers nor Tom Brady reached a conference championship game. This was also the first postseason since 2012–13 to have a Super Bowl to not feature Brady, Peyton Manning, or Patrick Mahomes. For the first time in history, both teams competing in the Super Bowl finished below the second seed.\nOf the 13 games played in the playoffs, nine were decided by seven or fewer points. For the final seven postseason games, six were decided by three points. Five of those six were decided with game-winning field goals. The only game that was not decided by three points was the divisional round game between the Bills and Chiefs, which was decided with a game-winning touchdown in overtime.\nSchedule.\nThis postseason marked the first time that the Wild Card playoffs spanned three days. Two games were played on Saturday, three on Sunday, and one on Monday night. The last time that a playoff game was played on a Monday was in , when a Wild Card game was played Monday, December 26, to avoid playing on Christmas.\nWild Card playoffs.\nSaturday, January 15, 2022.\nAFC: Cincinnati Bengals 26, Las Vegas Raiders 19.\nBengals linebacker Germaine Pratt's interception on his own 2-yard line in the game's closing seconds gave Cincinnati its first playoff win since the 1990 season, ending the longest active playoff victory drought in the NFL (8 losses over 31 years).\nLas Vegas took the opening kickoff and drove 51 yards in 10 plays, featuring a 17-yard completion from Derek Carr to Zay Jones on 3rd-and-2. Daniel Carlson finished the drive with a 47-yard field goal to put the Raiders up 3–0. Cincinnati stormed right back, with Joe Burrow completing three passes to Ja'Marr Chase for 37 yards and a screen pass to Joe Mixon for 21. On 3rd-and-goal from the 7, he finished the drive with a touchdown pass to tight end C. J. Uzomah to put the Bengals ahead 7–3. On the Raiders' next drive, Carr lost a fumble while being sacked by Trey Hendrickson. Defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi recovered the ball and returned it 11 yards to the Las Vegas 15-yard line, setting up Evan McPherson's 31-yard field goal to give the Bengals a 10–3 lead with 1:18 left in the first quarter.\nOn the ensuing kickoff, Raiders returner Peyton Barber fielded the ball too close to the sidelines and stepped out of bounds at his own 2-yard line. Two plays later, Sam Hubbard sacked Carr on the 1 and Trent Taylor's 14-yard punt return gave the Bengals excellent field position on the Raiders 45-yard line. Chase then rushed for 7 yards and caught a pass for 28 as the team drove to the 6 before Quinton Jefferson's third-down sack forced Cincinnati to settle for McPherson's 30-yard field goal, increasing their lead to 13–3. Tyron Johnson returned the ensuing kickoff 35 yards to the 39-yard line. Then Josh Jacobs carried the ball three times for 51 yards on the way to Carlson's 28-yard field goal that cut their deficit to 13–6. Taking the ball back with 7:55 left in the second quarter, Cincinnati drove 82 yards in 12 plays, featuring a 29-yard reception by Uzomah and a 15-yard run by Chase on an end around play on 4th-and-1. On 3rd-and-4 from the Raiders 10-yard line, Burrow ran to the right side of the field and threw the ball to Tyler Boyd for a touchdown just as his foot was about to go out of bounds. The play was controversial, as one of the officials blew his whistle slightly before Boyd made the catch, while the ball was still in the air, which, according to NFL rules should have resulted in the down having to be replayed, but the touchdown stood and it gave the Bengals a 20–6 lead with 1:51 left on the clock. Carr then completed 5 passes for 56 yards and rushed for 20 as he led his team 75 yards in 12 plays to score on his 14-yard touchdown pass to Jones with 14 seconds left in the half, making the score 20–13 going into halftime.\nBengals running back Chris Evans returned the second half kickoff 27 yards to the 35-yard line, where the team proceeded to drive 45 yards in 9 plays to score on McPherson's 43-yard field goal, giving them a 23–13 lead. On the Raiders' next drive, Hunter Renfrow caught a long pass from Carr on the Bengals 36 on third down and then lost the ball out of bounds when Jessie Bates knocked it out of his hands. The play was initially ruled a completion and fumble out of bounds, but Bengals coach Zac Taylor's replay challenge overturned the call and it was ruled an incompletion, forcing Las Vegas to punt. Cincinnati also ended up punting on their next possession, due to a third-down sack by Maxx Crosby. Then Las Vegas drove 76 yards in 12 plays, with Jacobs rushing 4 times for 25 yards and catching a pass for 7. The team made it all the way to Bengals 9-yard line, but then a holding penalty by guard John Simpson eliminated Jacobs' 8-yard run and pushed them back to the 19. The team was unable to get back to the end zone and ended up settling for Carlson's 34-yard field goal, cutting their deficit to 23–16 on the last play of the third quarter.\nCincinnati took the ball back and drove 65 yards in 13 plays, taking 7:31 off the clock. Burrow completed 6/7 passes for 56 yards, including a 19-yard completion to Chase of 3rd-and-7. On 3rd-and-1 from the Raiders' 10-yard line, Mixon was tackled inches short of the first down marker, forcing Cincinnati to settle for McPherson's 28-yard field goal to give them a 26–16 lead with 6:46 left in the game. The Raiders responded by advancing 67 yards in 12 plays, featuring Carr's 26-yard completion to DeSean Jackson on 4th-and-5. The Bengals defense halted the drive on their own 10 when Hubbard deflected Carr's pass on 3rd-and-3, but Carlson's fourth field goal made it a one-score game at 26–19 with 3:37 remaining on the clock. Then the Raiders forced a three-and-out, getting the ball back on their own 35-yard line with 1:51 left and no timeouts. On their first play, a roughing the passer penalty on Khalid Kareem turned Jacobs 15-yard reception into a 30-yard gain. An incompletion and a sack by B. J. Hill brought up 3rd-and-17, but then Carr completed a 23-yard pass to tight end Darren Waller on the Bengals 19. After two incompletions, Carr threw a 10-yard pass to Jones at the 9. Then he spiked the ball to stop the clock, giving the Raiders three chances to score with 29 seconds remaining. Two incompletions brought up 4th-and-goal. Then with 17 seconds left, Pratt intercepted Carr's pass and enabled Cincinnati to escape with a win.\nBurrow completed 24 of 34 passes for 244 yards and two touchdowns. Chase caught 9 passes for 116 yards and rushed three times for 23. In addition to his interception, Pratt added 9 tackles (6 solo). Evans returned 5 kickoffs for 103 yards and rushed for 9. Carr finished the game 29/54 for 310 yards and a touchdown, with 1 interception, while also rushing for 20 yards. Jacobs rushed for 83 yards and caught 4 passes for 44.\nAFC: Buffalo Bills 47, New England Patriots 17.\nIn their first postseason meeting since 1963, Buffalo beat the Patriots with 483 yards of offense and touchdowns on every drive except their last one, when they intentionally ran out the clock. It marked the first game in NFL history where a team played an entire game without punting, kicking a field goal, facing a fourth down, or turning the ball over (on downs nor by fumble or interception), as well as the first time a team scored seven touchdowns on seven consecutive drives.\nIn the first half alone, Buffalo ran 33 plays and gained over 300 yards. They started off the game with a 9-play, 70-yard drive in which Josh Allen rushed twice for 41 yards and completed 4/5 passes for 24, the last an 8-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dawson Knox. New England responded with a drive to the Bills 34, but Micah Hyde ended the drive by intercepting Mac Jones' pass in the end zone. Then Allen rushed for 6 yards and completed 5/7 passes for 62 yards, finishing the possession with an 11-yard scoring pass to Knox that gave Buffalo a 14–0 lead on the last play of the first quarter.\nNew England was quickly forced to punt and the Bills drove back for more points, this time moving the ball 81 yards in 10 plays. Allen had a 22-yard completion to Gabe Davis and an 8-yard run, while Devin Singletary carried the ball 6 times for 28 yards and finished the drive with a 3-yard touchdown run, making the score 20–0 after Deatrich Wise Jr. blocked the extra point. After another Patriots punt, Allen completed a 19-yard pass to wide receiver Isaiah McKenzie and a 45-yard bomb to Stefon Diggs before rushing the ball 9 yards. Then Singletary scored on a 16-yard touchdown run, giving the Bills a 27–0 lead with 1:51 left in the half. This time New England managed to respond, with Jones completed 6/6 passes for 51 yards, including a 19-yard throw to Jakobi Meyers on 4th-and-5. Nick Folk finished the drive with a 44-yard field goal that made the score 27–3 going into halftime.\nThe Bills dominance continued into the second half. On the fourth play of the third quarter, Levi Wallace intercepted a pass from Jones, giving Buffalo a first down on their 42-yard line. Allen then completed five consecutive passes for 58 yards, the last a 34-yard score to Emmanuel Sanders, putting the Bills up 33–3 after the extra point was blocked by Lawrence Guy. New England struck back with an 11-play, 75-yard drive, featuring a 43-yard completion from Jones to Kendrick Bourne. Jones completed the possession with a 3-yard touchdown pass the Bourne, cutting the score to 33–10. But the Bills countered again with a 9-play, 77-yard drive, which included two 19 yards completions from Allen. The first was to Cole Beasley and the second was to Davis for a touchdown, giving the Bills a 40–10 lead two plays into the fourth quarter.\nNew England had to punt on their next drive and Hyde returned it 52 yards to the Patriots' 39-yard line. Allen then completed a 38-yard pass to Knox before throwing a 1-yard score to offensive tackle Tommy Doyle on a tackle-eligible play, increasing the Bills lead to 47–10. New England responded with a 15-play, 77-yard drive to score on Jones' 4-yard touchdown pass to Bourne, but by then only 1:44 remained on the clock, which Bills backup quarterback Mitchell Trubisky kneeled out to finish the game.\nAllen completed 21 of 25 passes for 308 yards and 5 touchdowns, giving him a near-perfect passer rating of 157.6, while also rushing six times for 66 yards. Knox was the top receiver of the game with 5 receptions for 89 yards and two touchdowns. Singletary rushed for 81 yards and two touchdowns, and caught three passes for 13 yards. Jones finished the game 24 of 38 for 232 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. Bourne was his top target with 7 receptions for 77 yards and two scores. This would also turn out to be Bill Belichick's final playoff game as the Patriots' head coach.\nSunday, January 16, 2022.\nNFC: Tampa Bay Buccaneers 31, Philadelphia Eagles 15.\nTampa Bay ran up 31 unanswered points on the way to their fifth consecutive postseason win over the last two seasons. For 44-year-old Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady, it was his 35th and final career playoff win.\nThe Buccaneers started out the game with a 12-play, 75-yard drive to go up 7–0 on Giovani Bernard's 2-yard touchdown run. After the next three possessions ended in punts, Brady completed 5 of 6 passes for 62 yards on a 70-yard drive that ended with Ke'Shawn Vaughn's 1-yard score, putting the Buccaneers ahead 14–0 with 25 seconds left in the first quarter. The Eagles had to punt again and Tampa Bay drove back for more points, this time moving the ball 53 yards in 11 plays to take a 17–0 lead with Ryan Succop's 34-yard field goal.\nPhiladelphia responded with their most promising drive of the day, moving the ball to the Buccaneers 37-yard line, only to lose the ball with incomplete pass on 4th-and-5. Then after a punt, they drove to the Tampa Bay's 27. But once again they failed to score as Mike Edwards intercepted Jalen Hurts' pass in the end zone.\nBoth teams punted on their first possession of the second half, but on the Buccaneers punt, Jalen Reagor muffed the kick and Ross Cockrell recovered the ball for Tampa Bay on the Eagles 48-yard line. Brady started off the next drive with a screen pass to Bernard that picked up 21 yards and eventually finished it with a 2-yard touchdown toss to tight end Rob Gronkowski, increasing the lead to 24–0. Then linebacker Shaq Barrett intercepted a pass from Hurts and returned it 17 yards to the Eagles 36-yard line, where Brady gave the Buccaneers a 31–0 lead with a touchdown pass to Mike Evans on the next play.\nPhiladelphia finally managed to get on the board early in the fourth quarter after Reagor returned a punt 31 yards to the Eagles 35-yard line. Hurts completed a 31-yard pass to DeVonta Smith on the next play and then Boston Scott scored on a 34-yard touchdown run. Then after a punt, Hurts completed 7 of 9 passes for 81 yards and rushed for 6 on a 93-yard drive that ended with his 16-yard touchdown pass to running back Kenneth Gainwell. Hurts then completed a pass to Smith for a two-point conversion to make the score 31–15, but any chance of a comeback was snuffed out when the Buccaneers recovered Philadelphia's onside kick attempt.\nBrady completed 29 of 37 passes for 271 yards and two touchdowns. Evans caught 9 passes for 117 yards and a score. Bernard rushed for 44 yards and a touchdown, while also catching 5 passes for 39 yards.

Prescott started out the drive with a 38-yard completion to Dalton Schultz, but the team could go no further and turned the ball over on downs. The Cowboys managed to force another punt with 32 seconds left, giving them one last chance for a game-winning drive, but when Prescott scrambled 16 yards down the middle of the field to the 49ers 24-yard line with 7 seconds left and no timeouts, the clock ran out before the Cowboys could run another play.\nGaroppolo completed 16 of 25 passes for 171 yards and an interception.

But on the next play, Patrick Mahomes threw a pass that was deflected by T. J. Watt and intercepted by linebacker Devin Bush. The game remained scoreless until 10:51 remained in the second quarter, when Chiefs running back Darrel Williams lost a fumble when tackled by Cameron Heyward. Watt recovered the ball and returned it 26 yards for a touchdown to give the Steelers a 7–0 lead.

The Rams defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1975 Divisional playoffs. The teams split the regular season series, each winning the road game.\nLos Angeles built up a 21–0 first half lead and went on to win easily, holding the Cardinals to just 187 total yards. The victory was especially satisfying for 33-year old Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, who earned his first career playoff victory after 13 seasons as a starting NFL quarterback and three previous postseason losses with the Detroit Lions.\nAt the end of the Rams first drive of the day, Johnny Hekker's 43-yard punt gave Arizona the ball at their 9-yard line. Arizona could not gain any yards over their next three plays, and Brandon Powell's 8-yard punt return set the Rams up on their own 48. Stafford completed a 17-yard pass to Odell Beckham Jr. on the next play and eventually finished the drive with a 4-yard touchdown pass to Beckham that gave Los Angeles a 7–0 lead. The next time the Rams got the ball, Cam Akers rushed 4 times for 21 yards and Stafford completed a 31-yard pass to Beckham before taking the ball into the end zone himself for a 1-yard score.\nIn the second quarter, Hekker's 43-yard punt pinned the Cardinals back on their own 1-yard line. A couple plays later, Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray threw a desperation pass from his own end zone while trying to avoid being tackled for a safety. Rams cornerback David Long intercepted it near the line of scrimmage and returned it 3 yards for a touchdown to give the Rams a 21–0 lead. By this point, Arizona had five possessions without gaining a single first down. They managed to get three of them on their next drive, but it ended with another short pass near the line that was intercepted, this time by defensive tackle Marquise Copeland.\nLos Angeles increased their lead to 28–0 with the first drive of the second half, moving 75 yards in 8 plays, including a trick play where Stafford lateralled the ball to Beckham, who then threw a 40-yard completion to running back Cam Akers. Stafford finished the possession with a 7-yard touchdown pass to receiver Cooper Kupp. Arizona then drove 75 yards in 12 plays, with Murray completing 5/5 passes for 37 yards and rushing for 7 before James Conner put the team on the board with a 2-yard touchdown run. Then Murray completed a 2-point conversion pass to Antoine Wesley. Stafford countered with a 41-yard completion to Van Jefferson to set up Matt Gay's 37-yard field goal, giving Los Angeles a 31–8 lead on the first play of the fourth quarter. For the rest of the game, both teams managed a single field goal each to make the final score 34–11, with Arizona's Matt Prater connecting from 55 yards and Gay kicking another from 46, set up by Kupp's receptions for gains of 29 and 16 yards.\nStafford finished the day 13/17 for 202 yards and 2 touchdowns, along with 6 carries for 22 yards and a rushing touchdown. Hekker locked the Cardinals inside their own 20-yard line on all five of his punts. Murray was held to 19/37 for 137 yards with 2 interceptions. Los Angeles' defense also contained him on the ground, limiting him to just 2 carries for 6 yards.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 22, 2022.\nAFC: Cincinnati Bengals 19, Tennessee Titans 16.\nBengals linebacker Logan Wilson's interception with 20 seconds left in the game set up Evan McPherson for a 52-yard game-winning field goal as time expired to give Cincinnati their first road playoff win in franchise history.\nOn the first play of the game, Bengals safety Jessie Bates intercepted a pass from Ryan Tannehill, giving the Bengals a first down on the Tennessee 42-yard line. Joe Burrow's 21-yard completion to running back Joe Mixon on the next play set up a 38-yard field goal by McPherson to give the Bengals an early 3–0 lead. After the next three drives ended in punts, Burrow's 57-yard completion to Ja'Marr Chase led to a 45-yard field goal by McPherson, giving the team a 6–0 lead with just over 2 minutes left in the first quarter.\nFollowing a punt from each team, Tannehill got the Titans offense rolling with a 41-yard completion to A. J. Brown. Seven plays later, running back Derrick Henry took a direct snap out of Wildcat Formation and scored on a 3-yard touchdown run. A 12-men on the field penalty against Cincinnati on the extra point try moved the ball to the 1-yard line, where Tennessee decided to attempt a 2-point conversion. But Bengals linebacker Clay Johnston tackled Henry inches short of the goal line, keeping the score tied at 6–6. Bengals receiver Tee Higgins then caught passes for gains of 15 and 22 yards as the team drove 43 yards in 12 plays before defensive end Jeffery Simmons sacked Burrow for a 12-yard loss on 3rd down, forcing the team to settle for McPherson's 54-yard field goal with 1:27 left in the half.\nBengals running back Chris Evans returned the second half kickoff 31 yards to the 35-yard line. Burrow then completed 3 passes for 30 yards and rushed for seven, while Mixon had four carries on the drive for 34 yards, the last a 16-yard touchdown run to put the Bengals up 16–6. Tennessee responded with a 66-yard drive, including a 45-yard run by D'Onta Foreman that gave the team a first-and-goal from the Bengals 9-yard line. But on the next play, cornerback Mike Hilton went after Tannehill on a blitz, deflecting his pass behind the line of scrimmage and then hauling it in for an interception. Following a punt, the Titans drove 56 yards in 7 plays, one of them a 40-yard reception by Brown, to cut the score to 16–9 with former Bengals kicker Randy Bullock's 34-yard field goal. Evans once again set the Bengals up nicely, returning the kickoff 32 yards to the 40-yard line. But on the next play, Burrow threw a pass that bounced off the hands of running back Samaje Perine and was intercepted by Amani Hooker who managed to get his hands on the ball just before it hit the ground and return it 15 yards to the Bengals 27. Two plays later, Tannehill tied the score 16–16 with a 33-yard touchdown pass to Brown with 22 seconds left in the third quarter.\nCincinnati responded with a drive to the Titans 32 before linebacker Bud Dupree's 16-yard sack pushed the Bengals out of field goal range and forced a punt. The Titans then drove to a 3rd-and-1 on the Bengals 35. On the next play, Cameron Sample tackled Tannehill for no gain on a quarterback draw, and then Wilson and Markus Bailey stuffed Henry for a 2-yard loss on fourth down. Cincinnati took over and advanced to the Titans 48 before Burrow was sacked again by Simmons, forcing a punt. Kevin Huber's 42-yard kick gave the Titans the ball on their own 16 with 2:43 left in the game. Four plays ran two minutes off the clock and brought up a 3rd-and-5 on the Titans 40-yard line. On the next play, Tannehill threw a pass that was tipped by Eli Apple and intercepted by Wilson on the Bengals 47-yard line with 20 seconds remaining.\nTaking the ball back, Burrow completed a 15-yard pass to Chase, who stepped out of bounds. Two more running plays put the ball on the Titans 34, where McPherson kicked a 52-yard field goal as time expired to give Cincinnati the win.\nBurrow completed 28/37 passes for 347 yards and an interception, while also rushing twice for 5 yards. He also tied the postseason game record for sacks taken (9) and became the most-sacked quarterback to win a playoff game. Chase was his top target with 5 receptions for 109 yards. Higgins added seven receptions for 96 yards. Mixon rushed for 54 yards and a touchdown, while also catching 6 passes for 51 yards. Along with his interception, Wilson had 8 tackles (6 solo). Tannehill finished the day 15/24 for 220 yards and a touchdown, along with three carries for 12 yards, but was intercepted three times. Playing in his first game back after suffering a broken foot in week 8 of the regular season, Henry, who had been the league's leading rusher at the time of his injury, was held to 20 carries for 66 yards and a touchdown. Brown was the top receiver of the game with five receptions for 124 yards and a score. Simmons had eight tackles (seven solo) and three of the Titans' franchise record nine sacks.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 13, Green Bay Packers 10.\nDespite gaining just 212 yards of offense and no offensive touchdowns, San Francisco still managed to stun the heavily favored Packers on the road, largely due to their defense — which sacked Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers five times — and their special teams, which blocked two kicks, returning one for a crucial fourth quarter touchdown. Ultimately the 49ers offense pulled through on the final drive of the game, advancing 44 yards in 9 plays to score on Robbie Gould's game-winning field goal as time expired.\nGreen Bay started off the game with 69-yard, 10-play drive in which Rodgers completed 4/4 passes for 54 yards before A. J. Dillon's 6-yard touchdown run gave them a 7–0 lead. The next time the Packers got the ball, they drove to the 49ers 42, but then Fred Warner forced a fumble from tight end Marcedes Lewis that was recovered by linebacker Dre Greenlaw. After the next six drives ended in punts, San Francisco advanced the ball to the Packers 9-yard line. But after a holding penalty pushed them back 10 yards, Jimmy Garoppolo threw a pass that was intercepted by Adrian Amos. Green Bay took over on their 4-yard line with 54 seconds left in the second quarter. Two plays later on 3rd-and-3, Rodgers completed a 75-yard pass to running back Aaron Jones on the 49ers 14-yard line. But on the next play, Nick Bosa sacked him for an 8-yard loss and forced a fumble. The Packers recovered the ball, but had to settle for a 39-yard field goal attempt by Mason Crosby, which was blocked by 49ers safety Jimmie Ward.\nSan Francisco receiver Deebo Samuel returned the second half kickoff 45 yards to midfield. Samuel then rushed for 4 yards and caught two passes for 30 as the team drove 39 yards in 10 plays to score on Gould's 39-yard field goal, making the score 7–3. Following a punt by each team, Rodgers completed 5/6 passes for 48 yards, the longest a 25-yard gain to Davante Adams, as he led the Packers to the 49ers 8-yard line. On 3rd-and-goal, Rodgers was sacked for a 7-yard loss by defensive tackle Arik Armstead, forcing Green Bay to settle on Crosby's 33-yard field goal to put them up 10–3 with 9:01 left in the game. San Francisco responded with a drive to the Packers 19-yard line. On 4th-and-1, Elijah Mitchell was dropped for a 1-yard loss by linebackers Rashan Gary and De'Vondre Campbell.\nAfter a 2-yard run by Jones and a long incompletion, Armstead sacked Rodgers for a 12-yard loss, forcing Green Bay to punt from their own 12-yard line. Defensive end Jordan Willis blocked the kick, knocking the ball straight up in the air and then into the turf, where safety Talanoa Hufanga scooped it up and ran 6 yards into the end zone to tie the score at 10–10 with 4:41 left on the clock. The ensuing Green Bay offensive drive followed with a penalty for having an ineligible receiver downfield, a 4-yard reception from Adams and two straight incompletions by Rodgers. Corey Bojorquez's 57-yard punt then gave the ball to San Francisco on their own 29-yard line with 3:20 remaining.\nGaroppolo started off the drive with a 14-yard completion to Samuel. Then after a 4-yard run by Mitchell ran the clock to the 2-minute warning, another pass to Samuel gained 14 yards to the Packers 41. Two Samuel runs brought up 3rd-and-7, but then he picked up the first down with 9-yard carry to the Green Bay 29. Two more running plays moved the ball to the 27, where Gould kicked a 45-yard field goal as time expired to give San Francisco the win.\nSamuel was the 49ers top star on offense with 142 all-purpose yards (10 carries for 39 yards, 3 receptions for 44 yards, 2 kick returns for 59 yards).

From there, Tampa Bay gained 30 yards in 8 plays and scored on Leonard Fournette's 1-yard touchdown run, cutting their deficit to 27–13 in the closing seconds of the third quarter.\nThe Rams had to punt on their next drive, but linebacker Von Miller forced and recovered a fumble on the Buccaneers 25 while sacking Brady on the next play. Los Angeles seemed to be in prime position to put the game away, but they gave the ball right back to the Buccaneers on their next play, as a fumbled snap out of shotgun formation was recovered by defensive lineman Jason Pierre-Paul on the Los Angeles 45. Brady then led the team to a 3rd-and-5 on the Rams 25-yard line, only to turn the ball over on downs due to a 9-yard sack by Leonard Floyd and an incompletion over the next two plays.

Then after a punt, Edwards-Helaire rushed for a 20-yard gain and then receiver Mecole Hardman ran an end around play 25 yards for a touchdown, giving the Chiefs a 23–14 lead after Butker missed the extra point.

The Bengals responded with a 14-play, 61-yard drive to score on McPherson's 32-yard field goal with 36 seconds left in the first quarter, cutting the score to 7–3. But on the last play of the first quarter, Mahomes connected with Mecole Hardman on a 44-yard pass to the Bengals 31-yard line.

The Bengals responded by moving to a 2nd-and-12 from the Chiefs 41-yard line, aided by Tee Higgins's 18-yard reception. On the next play, Joe Burrow threw a screen pass to Samaje Perine, who took it all the way into the end zone to cut the Chiefs lead to eleven with 1:15 left in the second quarter. Due to a pair of catches from Tyreek Hill for 14 and 33 yards, the Chiefs were able to drive into Cincinnati's red zone, where a pass interference penalty on Eli Apple in the end zone gave them first and goal from the 1. With five seconds left in the second quarter, Kansas City attempted to score with a pass to Hill behind the line of scrimmage, but Apple tackled him short of the end zone as time expired in the half.\nCincinnati's goal-line stand at the end of the second quarter seemed to fire up their defense, which held the Chiefs to just a single field goal for the rest of the game. Mahomes, who completed 18 of 21 passes for 220 yards and three touchdowns in the first half, was held to just 8 of 18 second half completions for 55 yards, while being sacked four times and throwing 2 interceptions.\nTo begin the third quarter, the Cincinnati defense managed to stop the Chiefs' offense on their first two possessions of the second half. On their second drive of the half, the Bengals drove 52 yards in 11 plays, with Burrow completing a 22-yard pass to Ja'Marr Chase and an 18-yard throw to running back Joe Mixon, to score on McPherson's 31-yard field goal, cutting the deficit to 21–13. Then Mahomes threw a pass that was deflected behind the line and intercepted by B. J. Hill, who returned the ball three yards to the Chiefs 27. Burrow led the Bengals 27 yards in five plays, one of them a 17-yard catch by Chase. On 3rd-and-goal from the 2, Burrow hit Chase in the end zone for a touchdown, and then scored a 2-point conversion with a pass to Trent Taylor, tying the game at 21 apiece and erasing the early 18-point deficit with 14 seconds left in the third quarter.\nDuring the 4th quarter, Kansas City cornerback L'Jarius Sneed intercepted a pass from Burrow on the Chiefs 47-yard line. The team then moved into Cincinnati territory, but Trey Hendrickson sacked Mahomes on 3rd down to force a punt. Taking the ball back with 12:27 left, The Bengals advanced 46 yards in 11 plays, with Burrow completing a 16-yard pass to Higgins and personally converting two third downs. On 3rd-and-6 from his own 24, Burrow rushed for a 7-yard gain, and on 3rd-and-7 from the 34, he scrambled for 11 yards. KC's defense managed to halt the drive on their 34, where McPherson's 52-yard field goal gave the Bengals their first lead of the game, 24–21, with 6:04 left on the clock. Mahomes then completed 5/5 passes for 38 yards and rushed twice for 8 more as he led the team to a 1st-and-goal from the Bengals 5-yard line. Following a 1-yard run by Jerick McKinnon, Mahomes was sacked on consecutive plays by Sam Hubbard, fumbling the ball on the second one. Guard Joe Thuney recovered the fumble for the Chiefs, but the sacks pushed them all the way back to the 26-yard line with 3 seconds left. Harrison Butker then kicked a 44-yard field goal to send the game into overtime.\nThe Chiefs won the coin toss, taking the first possession of overtime. On 2nd-and-10, Kansas City barely avoided disaster when Mahomes threw a pass right into the arms of Apple, who dropped the ball instead of hauling in a potential interception. But on the next play, Mahomes heaved a long pass to Tyreek Hill, where the ball was deflected by Jessie Bates and intercepted by Vonn Bell, who returned it 5 yards to the Cincinnati 45-yard line. Cincinnati started off their drive with a 9-yard completion from Burrow to Higgins. Following two Mixon runs for 6 yards, Higgins made a crucial 8-yard catch on 2nd-and-8 from the Chiefs 40. Two more runs by Mixon gained 20 yards and then Burrow downed the ball on the Chiefs 13-yard line. On the next play, McPherson kicked a 31-yard field goal to win the game and send the Bengals to the Super Bowl. This was the third consecutive week McPherson was a perfect 4-for-4 on field goal attempts.\nBurrow completed 23 out of 38 passes for 250 yards, 2 touchdowns, and an interception, while also rushing five times for 25 yards. Higgins was his top target with six receptions for 103 yards. Mixon rushed for 88 yards and caught 3 passes for 27. Hubbard had 8 tackles (4 solo), 2 sacks, and a forced fumble. Mahomes combined for 275 yards, 3 passing touchdowns, and two interceptions, his first two picks in Conference Championship games in his career, while also rushing for 19 yards. Kelce caught 10 passes for 95 yards and a score. The loss prevented the Chiefs from reaching the Super Bowl and the victory enabled the Bengals to reach the big game for the first time since Super Bowl XXIII. Furthermore, it would be Tyreek Hill's last game as a Chief before being traded to Miami.\nThis game was played in the wake of the death of Howard Hesseman, an actor known for portraying Dr. Johnny Fever on \"WKRP in Cincinnati\". Many fans attributed the Bengals win to Howard’s passing.\nNFC: Los Angeles Rams 20, San Francisco 49ers 17.\nThe Los Angeles Rams overcame a 10-point fourth quarter deficit with three scores in the final period to earn their fifth Super Bowl appearance in franchise history.\nLos Angeles got their first scoring opportunity on their second drive, moving the ball to the 49ers 3-yard line. But on 3rd-and-goal, Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford threw a pass that was deflected by K'Waun Williams into the hands of Jimmie Ward for an interception. At the end of San Francisco's drive, Mitch Wishnowsky's 37-yard punt pinned the Rams back on their own 3-yard line. The Rams proved up to the task, moving the ball 97 yards in 18 plays on a drive that took 9:33 off the clock. Los Angeles wide receiver Cooper Kupp caught 3 passes for 36 yards on the drive, the last a 16-yard touchdown catch to give his team a 7–0 lead with 8:46 left in the second quarter.\nSan Francisco quickly struck back, with Jimmy Garoppolo completing a 31-yard pass to Brandon Aiyuk before connecting with Deebo Samuel for a 44-yard catch-and-run score to tie the game. Los Angeles responded with a drive to the 49ers 36-yard line, but could go no further and Matt Gay sailed a 54-yard field goal attempt wide right. Taking the ball back with 1:50 left on the clock, San Francisco drove 36 yards in 8 plays to take a 10–7 lead with Robbie Gould's 38-yard field goal as time expired in the half, continuing his perfection on career postseason field goal attempts (21-of-21).\nAfter forcing the 49ers to punt on the first drive of the third quarter, the Rams drove to a 2nd-and-1 on the San Francisco 43-yard line. But after an incomplete pass and a run for no gain, Stafford was stuffed short on a quarterback sneak, causing a turnover on downs. Los Angeles challenged the ruling, but the play was upheld. San Francisco then drove 58 yards in 10 plays to go up 17–7 on Garoppolo's 16-yard pass touchdown pass to tight end George Kittle with 1:59 left in the third quarter.\nHowever, this was the extent of San Francisco's success as the Rams would go on to dominate the final period. On the first play of Los Angeles' next drive, a 15-yard taunting penalty turned Kupp's 7-yard catch into a 22-yard gain. Then after an 11-yard catch by Kupp, tight end Kendall Blanton caught passes for gains of 20 and 9 yards before Kupp made the score 17–14 with an 11-yard touchdown reception. Following a 49ers punt, Stafford threw a deep pass that could have been easily intercepted by Jaquiski Tartt, only to have Tartt drop the ball. Instead, Stafford's completions to Odell Beckham Jr. for 29 yards (with an added 15-yard penalty against Ward for initiating helmet-to-helmet contact with Beckham) and Kupp for 16 yards set up Gay's 40-yard field goal, tying the score at 17 with 6:49 left in regulation. After forcing another punt, the Rams drove 49 yards in 10 plays, the longest a 25-yard catch by Kupp. Gay finished off the drive with a 30-yard field goal, giving the Rams a 20–17 lead with 1:46 left in the game. Then on the third play of San Francisco's next possession, Rams star defensive tackle Aaron Donald pressured Garoppolo and forced a pass off the hands of 49ers running back JaMycal Hasty and into the hands of Travin Howard for the interception, enabling Los Angeles to run out the rest of the clock as the Rams became the second NFL team to play a Super Bowl in their home stadium (the 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers won the previous Super Bowl at their home venue of Raymond James Stadium).\nStafford completed 31 of 45 passes for 337 yards and 2 touchdowns, with 1 interception, while also rushing for 8 yards. Kupp caught 11 passes for 142 yards and 2 scores, while Beckham had 9 receptions for 113. Garoppolo finished the day 16/30 for 232 yards and 2 touchdowns, with 1 interception, and 4 rushing yards.

A total of 16 teams competed in the knockout phase.\nTimes are CET/CEST, as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses).\nQualified teams.\nThe knockout phase involves the sixteen teams which qualified as winners and runners-up of each of the eight groups in the group stage.\n&lt;section begin=Qualified teams /&gt;\n&lt;section end=Qualified teams /&gt;\nFormat.\nEach tie in the knockout phase, apart from the final, was played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs advanced to the next round. If the aggregate score was level, the away goals rule was applied, i.e. the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs advanced. If away goals were also equal, then extra time was played. The away goals rule was again applied after extra time, i.e. if there were goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score is still level, the visiting team advanced by more away goals scored. If no goals were scored during extra time, the winners were decided by a penalty shoot-out. In the final, which was played as a single match, if the score was level at the end of normal time, extra time would be played, followed by a penalty shoot-out if the score was still level.\n&lt;section begin=Format /&gt;\nThe mechanism of the draws for each round was as follows:\nFor the quarter-finals and semi-finals, teams from the same city were not scheduled to play at home on the same day or consecutive days, due to logistics and crowd control. To avoid such scheduling conflict, if the two teams were drawn to play at home for the same leg, the order of legs of the tie involving the team which was not titleholders of Champions League or Europa League (or lower-tier, if both were continental titleholders), or the team with the lower domestic ranking in the qualifying season (if neither team were continental title holder) was reversed from the original draw.\nSchedule.\nThe schedule was as follows (all draws were held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland).\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket /&gt;&lt;section end=Bracket /&gt;\nRound of 16.\n&lt;section begin=R16 /&gt;\nThe draw for the round of 16 was held on 14 December 2020, 12:00 CET.&lt;section end=R16 /&gt;\nSummary.\n&lt;section begin=R16 /&gt;\nThe first legs were played on 16, 17, 23 and 24 February, and the second legs were played on 9, 10, 16 and 17 March 2021.\nMatches.\n\"Manchester City won 4–0 on aggregate.\"\n\"Bayern Munich won 6–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"Chelsea won 3–0 on aggregate.\"\n\"Liverpool won 4–0 on aggregate.\"\n\"4–4 on aggregate.

The final used a new format which took place over two days on 8–9 September in one final meet, the Weltklasse Zürich, as had been planned to be introduced in 2020 but was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA new award will be introduced for the \"Best Performing Athletes\" which will recognize ten athletes (five men and five women) for consistent top placements. US$50,000 will be awarded to one man and one woman in each of the sprints, hurdles, distance runnings, jumps, and throws.\nSchedule.\nThe following fourteen meetings are scheduled to be included in the 2021 season.\nThe Bislett Games in Oslo were originally scheduled to be the fourth meeting on 10 June, but on 10 April was delayed to an undetermined date (later scheduled for 1 July). On April 16 the first meeting on the calendar, Meeting de Rabat, was cancelled and the British Grand Prix in Gateshead was reintroduced to take its place on the same date. Additionally, the Golden Gala was relocated from Rome to Florence and pushed back to 10 June. On 7 May, UK Athletics announced the Anniversary Games will be relocated from the London Stadium due to the prohibitive costs of repurposing the stadium for only the meeting.

        "text": "The 2020–21 Australian Baseball League season was the eleventh year of the Australian Baseball League (ABL) season. The season was held from to . The Melbourne Aces won their second consecutive title by defeating the Perth Heat in a shortened playoff series.\nThe league was one of the many sports affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with its traditional November start pushed back to December, multiple in-season schedule changes, fixtures reduced to 24 games and the withdrawal of Geelong-Korea and Auckland Tuatara for the season.\nTeams.\nOn 12 November 2020, the league announced both Geelong-Korea and Auckland Tuatara had pulled out of the season for financial reasons. This breached Auckland's licensing agreement with the ABL and it was given 28 days to address the breach.\nThe league reverted to a six-team league for the first time since the 2017–18 Australian Baseball League season.\nRegular season.\nThe league had originally planned a staggered 24 game schedule. Both Brisbane and Adelaide were to host week-long 'hubs' starting their season 5 January, later than everyone else, and making up games by playing doubleheaders and mid-week.\nScheduled doubleheaders consist of a seven inning game followed by a nine inning game. The league uses the WBSC tiebreaker rule for all games going beyond the 9th inning, or extra innings beginning less than one hour to a curfew.\nDue to a more condensed schedule, roster limits were increased from 22 to 24, with no addition of underage development players.\nThe ABL roster formation points system was updated to 360 points across 24 games, with non-affiliated overseas players being worth two points, as opposed to four in previous seasons.\nThe season began with no state border restrictions until the first round of the season was impacted by the pandemic, with an outbreak of cases in Sydney's Northern Beaches effected both Canberra and Sydney unable to host or travel to multiple states. Sydney after playing the first two games of the season, were unable to play due to border restrictions through to 22 January.\nThe second round between Melbourne and Perth was also interrupted due to the previous cluster spreading to Victoria and impacting Western Australia's border closure on the state. After one game, Perth was flown out to Queensland with Canberra playing the remaining three games of the series. The Heat also replaced Melbourne's January fixtures in Brisbane. Canberra's and Melbourne's schedule was amended to play each other three consecutive rounds as the only logistical option with border closures.\nA single COVID case in Queensland on 7 January saw Brisbane's hub that included the Bandits, Heat &amp; Giants end prematurely as all three teams were flown out early to Adelaide as to not be stuck with border closures. Additional fixtures were added to be played in Adelaide to make up for some of these lost games.\nSydney was finally able to resume their season from 22 January against Canberra in Lismore, New South Wales. By playing in regional New South Wales, the Blue Sox did not have to deal with closed state borders, and Canberra did not have to enter a COVID hotspot.\nThe season was extended out an additional week to allow teams, namely the Blue Sox who had only played two games prior to 22 January, to play at least the benchmark of 14 games to qualify for the postseason.\nStandings.\n&lt;section begin=Standings /&gt;\nPostseason.\nDue to changes in the regular season presented by COVID enforced state border restrictions, the playoff structure was announced mid-season to include five teams. The fourth seed hosted the fifth seed 9 February in an elimination game before the winner joined the other three top seeded teams in a single elimination playoffs 11 &amp; 12 February.\nThe playoffs were originally scheduled to be a double-elimination playoffs over four days, but the host state Victoria experienced an outbreak of COVID, which forced the playoffs to be shortened to be single elimination over two days due to looming Australian state border closures. This meant a game on 12 February between the Giants and Cavalry was played with the premise of it being the losers bracket of the double elimination playoff, before it was changed to effectively a third place playoff retrospectively."

It was originally founded by the Portuguese Basketball League (LCB) in 1990 and it was run for 18 editions, formerly known as All-Star Game (Portuguese: Jogo das Estrellas). The PBF took over after the LCB ceased operations in 2008. The All-Star Game includes a match between the South and North selection, a slam-dunk and a three-point contest. The starting five of each selection is chosen by online voting by fans and the remainder is decided by coaches following the NBA pattern.\nHistory.\n,The first edition of the All-Star Game took place in 1990-91 season, in the Azorean island of Horta in 17 November 1990. It was organised by the now defunct League of Professional Clubs (LCB) and it featured players like Carlos Lisboa, Mike Plowden, Pedro Miguel Neves, Jean-Jacques Conceição and others. It would go on for 18 seasons until 2008 when LCB was dissolved. In the 2008-09 season the Portuguese Basketball Federation (FPB) took the responsibility of \norganising the event choosing the town of Moimenta da Beira as the host of the first All-Star Game under its auspices. For the following season the town of Guarda was next to host the event which went in hiatus right after and for 6 years. In 2016 the PFB revived the historical event integrating it into the 12th Albufeira Youth Basketball Festival (YBF), the largest national youth sports event of Portugal.\nList of games.\nOrganised by LCB 1990-2008.\nBold: Team that won the game.\nOrganised by PBF 2009-present.\nBold: Team that won the game."

The shop overlooks the 18th green of the Old Course at St Andrews, and was the oldest golf shop in the world. By 2010, the Tom Morris Golf Shop had been taken over by the St Andrews Links Trust, and eight years later it had closed, becoming The Open Store instead.\nHistory.\nIn 1835 when Old Tom Morris was 14, he became apprentice to Allan Robertson, who was the pro at St Andrews Links, working in his master's St Andrews workshop, producing golf balls and clubs. A contract was signed for 9 years, with 4 years as an apprentice, and 5 as a journeyman.\nWhen Robertson found out that Morris had played with the newly introduced gutta-percha ball in 1846, Robinson instantly sacked him. In 1848, having left his job with Robertson, Morris opened his own business making golf equipment, with his first golf shop at 15 The Links, St Andrews which he ran until 1851 when he accepted a position with Prestwick Golf Club as the first Keeper of the Green.

If two or more teams were equal on points after completion of the preliminary round, the following criteria were applied to determine team rankings:\nFinal.\nThe final was hosted by the team with the best record across both divisions.

The game finished in a 1-1 draw after the regulation 90 minutes, so it proceeded to a penalty shootout. Each team missed one penalty kick during the first five rounds, both hitting a shot off the crossbar. In the seventh round, Gotham FC, shooting first, had a shot saved by Portland goalkeeper Adrianna Franch, and Morgan Weaver converted Portland's try to win the tournament.\nStatistics.\nGoalscorers.\nStatistics do not include penalty-shootout goals.\nDiscipline.\nA player would be automatically suspended for the next match in the tournament for the following offenses:\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:\nAwards.\nDebinha of the North Carolina Courage was voted the tournament's Most Valuable Player.

        "text": "Robert Gray is a Canadian retired ice hockey goaltender who was the Most Outstanding Player of the 1964 NCAA Tournament.\nCareer.\nGray was a three-year starter for Michigan, beginning his career in 1961. On a team led by Red Berenson, Gray split time with Dave Butts and helped Michigan to a second-place finish in the WCHA, earning a spot on the All-WCHA Second Team. The Wolverines also finished as runner-up in the conference Tournament and received the second western seed for the NCAA Tournament. Michigan was stunned by a 4–5 loss to Clarkson in the semifinal and finished the tournament in third place.\nAfter Berenson's graduation the team declined sharply, ending up in last place the following year with a record of 7–14–3. During the year Gray again split time in goal, this time sharing the net with William Bieber. Because Gray's numbers had been far superior to Bieber's, the veteran was tasked with carrying the lion's share of starts during his senior season. Gray answered the bell and the Michigan offense had a miraculous recovery, scoring almost twice as many goals per game as they had the year before. Michigan finished atop the WCHA and, during the team's 12-game winning streak, Gray had a game for ages; in a 21–0 route of Ohio State, who were in their first year of varsity play, Gray was playing as a Forward and recorded a hat-trick.\nIn the conference tournament Michigan was nearly knocked out by Michigan Tech in the semifinal and were soundly beaten by Denver in the championship. The poor performances did not bode well for the Wolverines as they entered the 1964 NCAA Tournament. They faced ECAC Champion Providence in the semifinals and were obviously the better team, despite winning by just a single goal. They faced Denver for the championship and got off to a great start, scoring the first three goals of the game while Gray stopped 15 shots in the first period alone. Denver came close to tying the game twice but a 3-goal third period from the Maize and Blue put the game out of reach and Michigan won the national championship. Gray was named the Tournament Most Outstanding Player.\nAfter graduating, Gray played two years of professional hockey, serving as the backup goalie for the Fort Wayne Komets when the team won the 1965 Turner Cup. His last recorded appearance was for the Reno Aces in 1972. He was inducted into the Michigan Dekers Hall of Fame in 1990."

        "text": "The 2021 PBA Tour season, the 62nd season of play for the U.S. Professional Bowlers Association's ten-pin bowling tour, began on January 14 with the Regional Portions of the PBA Players Championship. The season included 14 singles title events and two doubles title events.\nThe 2021 season has featured three televised perfect 300 games, the 30th, 31st and 32nd in PBA Tour history. The first was accomplished by Chris Via (February 7, PBA Players Championship East Region finals) and the second by Sam Cooley (May 16, PBA Tour Playoffs). Via then rolled his second 300 game of the season on June 27 at the PBA Tour Finals, joining Sean Rash and François Lavoie as the only players in history with two televised 300 games in PBA Tour title events.\nThis season has also seen the fourth-ever 7–10 split conversion in a televised PBA Tour event (and first since 1991), accomplished by 18-year old rookie Anthony Neuer in the semifinal match of the U.S. Open.\nKyle Troup has set the PBA's single-season earnings record this season, with $496,900. The previous record holder was Walter Ray Williams Jr., who earned $419,700 in the .\nSeason overview.\nThe PBA announced it would open the 2021 season with a revamped and expanded PBA Players Championship that opens up the event to a broader portion of the PBA membership. Five Regional events (West, Southwest, Central, South and East) were hosted first. After 28 qualifying games (7 games on each of four different oil patterns), each Region held its own stepladder finals broadcast on FS1. The five Regional winners then competed in the tournament finals held in Jupiter, Florida on February 21, which was broadcast live on Fox. The Regional concept was introduced, in part, due to travel restrictions that have resulted from the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, and will allow most PBA professionals to compete in safe events closer to home. In addition, the 2021 PBA Players Championship featured a $1 million prize fund, with a PBA record-tying $250,000 first place prize.\nThe PBA Tournament of Champions took place February 23–28, also in Jupiter, Florida (following the conclusion of the PBA Players Championship finals in the same location). The PBA then moved to Tampa, Florida for World Series of Bowling (WSOB) XII. WSOB XII featured three animal oil pattern title events (Cheetah, Chameleon, Scorpion), with these three tournaments serving as initial qualifying for the PBA World Championship major. WSOB XII also included the PBA Roth-Holman Doubles Championship. The PBA World Championship finals aired on Saturday afternoon, March 13 on Fox, kicking off five consecutive days of broadcasts. The Roth-Holman Doubles, Cheetah Championship, Chameleon Championship and Scorpion Championship aired March 14–17 on FS1.\nThe U.S. Open was originally scheduled to take place in Green Bay, Wisconsin while the USBC Masters was to be held in Las Vegas, Nevada. In December 2020, the USBC announced the two events would be held in back-to-back weeks (March 30 through April 11). Both tournaments were held in Reno, Nevada due to COVID-19 continuing to impact USBC operations.\nFollowing the U.S. Open was the PBA Super Slam on April 18, which saw the five PBA major winners vying for a $100,000 first prize. The third annual PBA Tour Playoffs ran from April 24 through May 16. Previous events featured the top 24 players in points through the first 13 events of the season, but due to only nine events being scheduled before the 2021 Playoffs, this season's tournament started with the top 16 players only.\nOn April 29, the PBA announced the return of the King of the Lanes event, to be held this season on June 19 &amp; 20 in Portland, Maine. The \"last man standing\" format will have reigning king Kris Prather returning, with a mix of veteran and current players looking to gain the throne over the five rounds. The challengers include: Chris Barnes, AJ Johnson, Jesper Svensson, Parker Bohn III, Chris Via, Anthony Neuer, Tim Mack, Jason Sterner, Tom Daugherty and François Lavoie. The PBA member event will be preceded by an all-women's event, the , on June 15 &amp; 16. (In the 2020 PBA King of the Lanes, two females – Clara Guerrero and Gazmine Mason – participated against an otherwise all-male field.) This marked the first PBA event to have a live audience since February 2020.\nThe PBA Tour Finals, featuring the top eight points earners since the start of the 2020 season, was held June 26–27 in Allen Park, Michigan, with all rounds airing live on CBS Sports Network.\nIn May, the PBA finalized scheduling for five Summer Tour events, beginning with the Lubbock Sports Open on July 23–25 and concluding with the Chesapeake Open on August 20–22. All events awarded a PBA title, Tier 3 Tour points and a minimum $10,000 winner's share, with a $40,000 bonus pool up for grabs based on combined points over the five stops. The top points earner (Darren Tang) won a $20,000 bonus, with smaller amounts awarded to the second through tenth place finishers.\nTournament summary.\nThe events for the 2021 PBA tournament schedule are shown below. Major tournaments are in bold. Career PBA title numbers for winners are shown in parentheses (#). Winner's share prize money is shown in US dollars ($), except where indicated.\nTour points are awarded for most events. Besides the season-ending Harry Smith PBA Points Winner award, points are one consideration for Player of the Year voting, and also affect eligibility for the PBA Tour Playoffs and PBA Tour Finals (combined with 2020 points). Points for tournaments are awarded differently based on a \"tier\" system. The tier of each qualifying tournament is shown in the Notes column on the tournament schedule, and is explained below."

The tournament was held from 3 to 24 April 2021.\nAs not all teams played each other, the Grand Slam and Triple Crown were not contested.\nBackground and format.\nTraditionally, the Women's Six Nations Championship is run concurrently with the men's tournament. However, in January 2021, the 2021 Women's Six Nations Championship was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused travel and time restrictions issues due to qualification of the 2021 Rugby World Cup needing to be completed before the tournament starts in September. Most of the players have jobs outside of rugby, and some players are key workers. This, combined with national lockdowns and the need for COVID-19 testing, made it more difficult to schedule the matches during the pandemic.\nOn 3 February, it was announced that the 2021 Women's Six Nations Championship would take place between 3 and 25 April, in a condensed format. The six teams were split into two pools of three teams. Each team played the other two teams in their pool, with one match at home and one away. Each team had one bye weekend. The winners of each pool met each other in the final, as did the two second and third-placed teams. The team in Pool A hosted regardless of who performed better in their pool, and the winner of the play-off between the two first-ranked sides won the tournament. The format is similar to the 2020 men's Autumn Nations Cup. Provisional fixture lists were also announced on 3 February, and the venues and kick-off times were announced on 23 March."

        "title": "George Paton (American football executive)",
        "text": "George Paton (born May 5, 1970) is an American football executive who is the general manager of the Denver Broncos of the National Football League (NFL). Paton previously served as the assistant general manager and vice president of player personnel for the Minnesota Vikings and served with the Vikings in various executive roles for 14 seasons. Paton began his NFL career as a scout for the Chicago Bears before serving as the director of pro personnel for the Miami Dolphins from 2001 to 2006 and joining the Vikings in 2007. Before his career as an executive, Paton played college football at UCLA and later professionally in the Austrian Football League and Italian Football League. Paton’s tenure in Denver has been marked by a number of high-risk moves that have achieved poor results, thus leading to widespread criticism from several observers.\nEarly years.\nA native of La Cañada Flintridge, California, Paton played quarterback at Loyola High School (Los Angeles), and was a four year letter winner at defensive back for the UCLA from 1988 to 1991, being a part of a pair of Bruin bowl teams. While at UCLA, Paton earned a bachelor's degree in history.\nEurope.\nIn 1992, Paton played in the Italian Football League. In 1993, Paton played in the Austrian Football League with the Vienna Vikings. The team reached the semi-finals of the league playoffs.\nExecutive career.\nChicago Bears.\nIn 1997, Paton began his executive career with the Chicago Bears in their scouting and personnel department, eventually rising up to the position of assistant director of pro personnel in 2000.\nMiami Dolphins.\nIn 2001, Paton was hired by the Miami Dolphins as their director of pro personnel.\nMinnesota Vikings.\nIn 2007, Paton was hired as the director of player personnel for the Minnesota Vikings, reuniting with the Vikings vice president of player personnel, Rick Spielman, who worked with Paton in Miami and Chicago. When Spielman was promoted to the Vikings general manager in 2012, Paton was promoted to be assistant general manager. In 2019, Paton was given an additional role as vice president of player personnel.\nDenver Broncos.\nOn January 12, 2021, Paton was named the general manager of the Denver Broncos.\nIn January 2022, Paton hired former Green Bay Packers offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett to be the team's next head coach following the firing of Vic Fangio. Paton hired Hackett instead of Kevin O’Connell, Brian Daboll, or Mike McDaniel, who all landed NFL head coaching jobs that same offseason and led each of their respective teams to at least one playoff appearance in future seasons.\nAbout six weeks later, Paton agreed to a blockbuster trade for nine-time Pro Bowl and former Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson. Denver gave two first-round picks, two second-round picks, a fifth-round pick, quarterback Drew Lock, defensive lineman Shelby Harris, and tight end Noah Fant to Seattle for Wilson and a fourth-round pick. Paton subsequently awarded Wilson with a five-year contract extension worth $245 million (to keep Wilson in Denver through the 2028 season) before the quarterback played a down for the team.\nAlthough these moves were expected to propel the Broncos back into playoff contention, the Broncos finished the 2022 season with a disastrous 5-12 record and last place finish in the AFC West. Wilson struggled through the worst season of his career in 2022, and Hackett was fired before the end of the season after a blowout loss to the injury-riddled Los Angeles Rams. After Paton hired coach Sean Payton, who led the New Orleans Saints to a Super Bowl victory, to become the Broncos’ head coach in 2023, Wilson and the Broncos improved, but the team missed the playoffs again with an 8-9 record. On March 4, 2024, Paton and Payton announced that the organization would release Wilson at the beginning of the 2024 NFL league year. Wilson's release resulted in an NFL record $85 million dead cap hit.\nThe Broncos have also had a track record of poor drafting under Paton’s control of the team, with the 2022 and 2023 draft classes both being graded as among the worst in the league by several NFL analysts. Writers have pointed to the Broncos’ lack of talent over Paton’s tenure as evidence of subpar drafting.\nThe aforementioned moves and drafts, along with several other unsuccessful acquisitions, have resulted in fans, analysts, and writers heavily criticizing Paton during his tenure as the Broncos’ general manager.\nPersonal life.\nThe son of a high school football coach, Paton is married to Barbara. They have two children, a daughter, Bella and a son, Beau."

        "title": "County Championship (rugby league)",
        "text": "The County Championship was a representative competition of British counties in rugby league between 1895 and 1983. \nThroughout the competition history the championship was contested by Lancashire, Yorkshire (both present in every season), Cheshire, Cumbria, Durham and Northumberland, Glamorgan and Monmouthshire, and Other Nationalities. The games between Lancashire and Yorkshire became known as the \"War of the Roses\".\nHistory.\nWhen the northern clubs broke away from the Rugby Football Union (RFU) to form the Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU) there was already a county championship competition within the RFU and the NRFU organised a similar competition as one of its first actions with the first fixtures being announced on 17 September 1895, only three weeks after the split from the RFU.\nAll the constituent clubs of the NRFU at this point came from just three counties; Cheshire, Lancashire and Yorkshire so the championship was organised to involve sides from these three locations. Players were eligible to play for their county of birth or the county in which they first played.\nIn the first season the all three teams won one game each so the NRFU arranged a further round of fixtures so that each county had played the others both home and away. With Lancashire winning both of their second set fixture, they became the first winners of the County Championship. This was the only season the teams played each other twice. In all subsequent seasons each team only played the others once.\nThe first change to the structure came in 1898 with the addition of Cumberland to the championship. Four years (the 1902–1903 season) later a fifth team entered the competition with a team jointly representing Durham and Northumberland playing. Durham and Northumberland's participation only lasted until the end of the 1903–1904 season when the county union withdrew from the Championship.\nThe competition continued as a four-team competition for a further two seasons but prior to the start of the 1905–1906 season Cheshire withdrew and effectively merging with Lancashire, the Runcorn club was admitted to the Lancashire League and its players became eligible for selection by Lancashire.\nUntil the competition was suspended at the outbreak of the First World War, it continued as a triangular competition with the only change being to allow players born in Westmorland to play for Cumberland.\nResuming in the 1919–1920 season there were no changes to the format until the Rugby Football League (RFL) (the NRFU became the RFL in 1922) admitted a team jointly representing the Welsh counties of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire. The Welsh side's involvement lasted just four seasons and they dropped out of the Championship after the 1930–1931 season.\nFrom 1931 until 1974 the competition remained a three team affair. Suspended again during the Second World War the competition resumed in 1945 and remained unchanged the 1974–1975 season when an Other Nationalities team competed for two seasons. Back to three teams from 1976–1977 the competition was last held in the 1982–1983 season when due to declining attendances the competition was abandoned. The final competition, 1982–1983, was held immediately after the end of the 1981–1982 league season as the fixture calendar for the autumn was congested with fixtures for the visiting Australian team.\nDuring the 1977–1978 season the competition was not held and instead two games (Yorkshire v Cumbria and Lancashire v Yorkshire) were held to raise money for the Queen's Silver Jubilee Fund.\nTitles.\nThe title was awarded to the team with the most competition points (2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw). After the 1905–1906 competition ended with Lancashire and Cumberland both on 3-points a play-off game was organised between the two but ended in a 3-all draw so the championship was awarded to both teams. From then on until the 1950s if two teams finished on the same number of competition points then the title was awarded jointly to both counties and if three teams finished on the same number of competition points, the title was classed as \"undecided\".\nThe 1952–1953 season ended with all three teams having won one game each, Lancashire were awarded the title on points average (points scored divided by points conceded). The following season an additional play-off match was arranged between the two teams in the tie with the best points average. Five titles between 1953–1954 and 1972–1973 were decided in this way. In 1978-1979 and 1979–1980 both competitions ended in three-way ties but no play-off game was arranged and the title was awarded to the team with the best points difference.\nChampionships won:"

        "title": "Equestrian statue of Sir Redvers Buller",
        "text": "An equestrian statue of General Sir Redvers Buller stands at the junction of Hele Road and New North Road, close to Exeter College, Exeter, between St David's Church, Exeter and Bury Meadow Park. It was unveiled in 1905, and the bronze statue is mounted on a plinth of Cornish granite. It became a Grade II listed building in 1953.\nBackground.\nBuller was the second son and eventual heir of James Wentworth Buller (1798–1865), MP for Exeter, by his wife Charlotte Juliana Jane Howard-Molyneux-Howard (d.1855), third daughter of Lord Henry Thomas Howard-Molyneux-Howard, Deputy Earl Marshal and younger brother of Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk. Redvers Buller was born on 7 December 1839 at the family estate of Downes, near Crediton in Devon, inherited by his great-grandfather James Buller (1740–1772) from his mother Elizabeth Gould, the wife of James Buller (1717–1765), MP.\nBuller was appointed commander of the British Army forces sent to South Africa in the opening phases of the Second Boer War, from October 1899 to January 1900. He had served in several colonial campaigns and as a lieutenant colonel won the Victoria Cross in retreat after the Battle of Hlobane in the Anglo-Zulu War. \nBuller died on 2 June 1908, at the family seat, Downes House, Crediton, Devon, and is buried in the churchyard of Holy Cross Church in Crediton.\nDescription.\nThe bronze statue was paid for by public subscription which raised over £2,000 from 50,000 people. It was made by Adrian Jones in 1902 and cast at the foundry of A.B. Burton in Thames Ditton. It depicts Buller in his uniform as a general, in a greatcoat and plumed bicorn, wearing his Victoria Cross, and riding his horse \"Biffen\". The bronze statue weighs 4.5 tons. The rectangular granite plinth, which weighs 35 tons, was a gift of John St Aubyn, 1st Baron St Levan, and was carved by Pethick Brothers of Plymouth. The statue is facing away from Buller's birthplace and family estate at Downes, Crediton.\nOne face of the plinth bears a bronze badge of the King's Royal Rifle Corps, a crowned Maltese cross, and the Latin motto of the corps: \"Celer et Audax\" (\"Swift and Bold\"). The three other faces each bear inscriptions – one giving his name and honours, \"Redvers Buller / VC GCB GCMG / of Downes\"; another listing his military services, \"1859-1900 / India China / Canada Ashanti / Egypt / South Africa / He Saved Natal\", with the last referring to his service in the Boer War and the relief of Ladysmith, notwithstanding defeats at the battles of Colenso and Spion Kop; and the last recording that the statue was \"Erected / by his countrymen / at home and beyond the seas / 1905\".\nReception.\nIt was unveiled on 6 September 1905 by the Lord Lieutenant of Devon, Lord Ebrington, a late substitute for Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley who was indisposed through influenza. Buller attended the unveiling, with his wife Lady Audrey and daughter Georgina, with a guard of honour from the 1st Rifle Volunteers. The ceremony drew a crowd of several thousand. A choir sang \"Land of Hope and Glory\", and the band of the 4th Battalion, King's Royal Rifles, played \"God Save the Queen\". After the unveiling, the band also performed to crowds in Northernhay Park, Belmont Pleasure Grounds and St Thomas Belmont Pleasure Grounds; Buller and his family attended a reception at the Victoria Hall in Queen Street (which was demolished after being damaged by fire in 1919); and a celebratory tea was served to 500 military veterans in Bury Meadow Park.\nBuller died at his home at Downes, Crediton in 1908, and is buried at Crediton Parish Church.\nThe statue became a Grade II listed building in 1953.\nIn January 2021, a five-person committee of Exeter City Council councillors voted to seek permission to move the statue from its location near Exeter College, \"because of the man it portrays [and] because of the names carved on the plinth of colonial campaigns which sought to advance British imperialist interests in other countries\", which means \"the current location is inappropriate because it is outside an educational establishment, which includes young people from diverse backgrounds\". Three members voted for moving and two voted against. \nIn spring 2021, they voted in favour of installing information boards as well as other projects and training. "

        "text": "The 1967 World Open Snooker Championship was a series of 51 matches between Fred Davis and Rex Williams for the title won by Davis at the 1960 World Open Snooker Championship. Despite the name of the competition, Davis and Williams were the only contestants. Williams took the title by winning 26 matches to Davis' 25, a winning margin having been achieved at 26–23.\nSummary.\nFred Davis had won the 1960 World Open Snooker Championship, which had been held in Australia with eight players competing in a round-robin. Davis and Rex Williams arranged to play a series of 31 matches with the winner taking the title, and with each player taking a fee from each of the match venues. Snooker historian Clive Everton has suggested that the agenda behind the contest was to allow Williams to gain a world snooker title and become more marketable, at a time when he was unlikely to win against the reigning world champion John Pulman. Everton claims that Davis remarked \"I had a devil of a job to let him win.\"\nAll matches were of five .\nOriginally there were going to be 31 matches in the series, but this was later extended to 51.\nDavis won the first three matches, before Williams had his first win in the fourth match. These were played in front of capacity crowds at each venue. Williams later levelled at 5–5, with Davis then winning three of the next five matches to lead 8–7 by Christmas 1966. After the resumption of the series in January 1967, Williams won two matches to take the lead for the first time, at 9–8, but then lost the next three to trail 9–11, before winning four in succession to lead 13–11. With the pair each obtaining four wins from the next eight matches, Williams led 17–16.

        "text": "The 2021 UEFA Nations League Finals was an international football tournament held in Italy from 6 to 10 October 2021. The four national teams involved in the tournament were required to register a squad of up to 23 players – of which three had to be goalkeepers – by 30 September 2021, 23:59 CEST (), six days prior to the opening match of the tournament. Only players in these squads were eligible to take part in the tournament.\nIn the event that a player on the submitted squad list suffered from an injury or illness prior to his team's first match of the tournament, that player could be replaced, provided that the team doctor and a doctor from the UEFA Medical Committee both confirmed that the injury or illness was severe enough to prevent the player from participating in the tournament. Players who either tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or had been declared as \"close contacts\" of a positive SARS-CoV-2 tested person – and therefore were put in isolation by the decision of health authorities – were considered cases of serious illness and could therefore be replaced before the first match. If a group of players of a team were placed into mandatory quarantine or self-isolation prior to a match following a decision from national or local health officials due to positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, and fewer than 13 players were available (including at least one goalkeeper), additional players could be called up to meet the minimum of 13 players required. In such a case, an equivalent number of quarantined players had to be definitively withdrawn from the 23-player list.\nThe position listed for each player is per the official squad lists published by UEFA. The age listed for each player is their age as of 6 October 2021, the first day of the tournament. The numbers of caps and goals listed for each player do not include any matches played after the start of the tournament. The club listed is the club for which the player last played a competitive match prior to the tournament. The nationality for each club reflects the national association (not the league) to which the club is affiliated. A flag is included for coaches who are of a different nationality to their team.\nBelgium.\nManager: Roberto Martínez\nBelgium's final squad was announced on 1 October 2021, with Matz Sels also selected as a stand-by goalkeeper. Thomas Meunier withdrew injured and was replaced by Thomas Foket on 5 October. Thorgan Hazard withdrew injured and was replaced by Arthur Theate on 6 October.\nFrance.\nManager: Didier Deschamps\nFrance's final squad was announced on 30 September 2021.\nItaly.\nManager: Roberto Mancini\nItaly's final squad was announced on 30 September 2021. Ciro Immobile and Rafael Tolói withdrew injured and were replaced by Moise Kean and Davide Calabria, respectively, on 3 October. Matteo Pessina withdrew injured and was replaced by Federico Dimarco on 4 October.\nSpain.\nManager: Luis Enrique\nSpain's final squad was announced on 30 September 2021. Pedri withdrew injured and was replaced by Brais Méndez on 1 October. Marcos Llorente and Brais Méndez withdrew injured and were replaced by Bryan Gil and Sergi Roberto, respectively, on 3 October."

He was recruited to North Dakota in 1960 and began playing with the varsity club the following season. McLean led a fairly weak Fighting Sioux squad in goals (19), assists (19) and points (38) but the team finished 5th in the WCHA and was left out of the conference tournament. The following year the team coalesced around a core of upperclassmen with McLean again leading the team in scoring. This time UND tied Denver for the regular season WCHA title and McLean was on both All-WCHA First Team and an All-American. The fighting Sioux swept aside defending national champion Michigan Tech in the semifinal and, though they fell to the Pioneers in the final, UND had already earned a bid to the 1963 NCAA Tournament.\nNorth Dakota dominated Boston College in the semifinal, winning 8–2 and found themselves facing Denver once more for the national championship. UND got off to a blistering start, scoring 5 goals in the first period and led 5-2 after 20 minutes. McLean scored his second goal of the game 5 minutes into the second and then the team held on for dear life as Denver attempted to erase the Sighting Sioux's advantage. The Pioneers scored three timed before the end of the match but they couldn't get the equalizer and McLean's tally held up as the game-winner. McLean was named as the Tournament Most Outstanding Player.\nMcLean left UND after the season to play for the Canadian National Team and traveled to the 1964 Winter Olympic Games in Innsbruck, Austria but did not see ice time due to an injury. He finished out his college career playing closer to home with the UBC Thunderbirds and later briefly appeared for the Vancouver Canucks before retiring. He was inducted into the North Dakota Letterwinners Hall of Fame in 1997."

        "text": "The South Australian PGA Championship was a professional golf tournament played in South Australia. It was first held in 1927.\nHistory.\nThe first South Australian Professional Championship was held in 1927 and was a 72-hole stroke-play event. It was won by Rufus Stewart, four ahead of Fergus McMahon. Stewart had recently won the Australian Open. McMahon won in 1928, 1929 and 1930, and as a three-time winner he permanently kept the trophy that had been presented in 1927. With only a small number of professional in the state, there were only four different winners in the first 15 championships. Stewart won 6 times and McMahon 5 times, while Alf Toogood won twice, before he moved to Tasmania, and Willie Harvey also won twice, in 1938 and 1940. The format changed to match-play in 1937, all matches being over 36 holes. In 1937 and 1938 there were just 8 entries and a straight knock-out format was used. However, there were 9 entries in 1939 and a 36-hole qualifying stage was used to reduce the field to 8. In 1940 the qualifying stage was retained but just four players advanced to the match-play stage. The 1941 event was reduced to a single day, with 36 holes of stroke-play.\nThe championship resumed in 1946, using the 1940 format with four players qualifying, and this format was retained for a number of years. From 1946 to 1950 only 16 players qualified for the Australian PGA Championship. Each state was allocated a specific number of places and organised their own qualifying event for those places. South Australia was allocated just one place. In 1946 there was a 36-hole qualifying event but from 1947 to 1950 the winner of the South Australian Professional Championship qualified. \nIn 1952 there was a dispute between the two finalists, Brian Crafter and Fred Thompson. Crafter won the match at the 38th hole but at the 35th hole he had lifted and dropped his ball away from a staked tree. Thompson objected and the matter was not fully resolved until just before the 1953 event, confirming Crafter as the winner."

The Red Flash represent Saint Francis University in the NCAA Division I Northeast Conference.\nSaint Francis began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1918. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a statistic in Division I until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Saint Francis' record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "title": "Equestrian statue of Charles Devens",
        "text": "The equestrian statue of Charles Devens (also known as the Worcester County Devens Memorial Statue) is a public monument in Worcester, Massachusetts, United States. Located in front of the old Worcester County Courthouse in the Institutional District, the equestrian statue honors Charles Devens, who served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War and later served as United States Attorney General. The statue was designed by Daniel Chester French and Edward Clark Potter and was dedicated on July 4, 1906.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nCharles Devens was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts, United States on April 4, 1820. In his youth, he attended the Boston Latin School. He graduated from Harvard College in 1838 and received a Bachelor of Laws degree from Harvard Law School in 1840. He began practicing law in 1841. Devens became involved in politics shortly thereafter, serving as a member of the Massachusetts Senate from Franklin County between 1848 and 1849, and between 1849 and 1853, he served as the United States marshal for the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. During the American Civil War, Devens served in the Union Army as the major of a rifle battalion and later as colonel of the 15th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. By the end of the war, Devens had reached the rank of general and had been wounded at both the Battle of Fair Oaks and the Battle of Chancellorsville. He resumed his law career following the war and in 1873 became an associate justice for the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. In 1877, he was appointed the United States Attorney General by President Rutherford B. Hayes, a position he would hold until 1881. Devens would later die in Boston on January 7, 1891.\nCreation.\nEfforts towards the erection of a monument honoring Devens began in late 1891 when United States Senator George Frisbie Hoar of Massachusetts sent requests to many prominent citizens from Worcester with the following letter on November 9:\nAt the meeting, a committee of 35 men was formed for the purposes of raising funds for the monument, and a circular discussing the monument and its projected cost of $15,000 was prepared. However, no further action was taken by the committee, and the project languished for about a decade. The idea for a monument was revived in fall 1901 during a meeting of the veterans' organization for the 15th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. A committee was formed by the organization, and in March 1902, a general committee consisting of many prominent citizens from the area was formed. Notable members included Hoar, Rufus B. Dodge Jr. (mayor of Worcester), Thomas Corwin Mendenhall (president of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute), Daniel Merriman (president of the Worcester Art Museum), and multiple members of the veterans' organization, among others. On April 4, 1902, the Massachusetts General Court granted an act of incorporation on the \"Worcester County Memorial Devens' Statue Commission\".\nFollowing this, the commission began to raise public funds for the monument. The city of Worcester appropriated $7,500, while $5,000 was appropriated by Worcester County, with roughly $4,000 in additional funding appropriated by several other towns in the county. On July 12, 1902, the commission voted to hire the sculptors Daniel Chester French and Edward Clark Potter to design an equestrian statue of Devens, at a cost of no more than $30,000. French and Potter had collaborated on several equestrian statues before this, and as with their previous collaborations, French was responsible for the human part of the statue, while Potter was responsible for the horse. On November 27, 1903, the sculptors submitted a model of the proposed statue, which was accepted by the commission. Additionally, the architect Robert D. Andrews from Boston was hired to design the pedestal for the statue. The George D. Webb Granite and Construction Co. was contracted to create the pedestal, while Jno. Williams, Inc., a foundry in New York City, was responsible for the creation of tablets and letterings that would be fixed to the pedestal. On October 17, 1903, the commission accepted the final design of the statue by French and Potter, and subsequently, the model was sent to the Gorham Manufacturing Company in Providence, Rhode Island for casting. Senator Hoar had managed to get several condemned cannons to be appropriated by the United States Congress to be used in the casting, with a total value of approximately $2,000.\nDedication.\nIn December 1905, work on the monument was nearing completion, and the commission assembled a committee to plan the statue's dedication. The committee petitioned the city council of Worcester for permission to place the monument on public land in front of the Worcester County Court House, which was granted. The unveiling ceremony took place on July 4, 1906 (Independence Day) in front of the courthouse, with approximately 250 militia members and over 1,000 Civil War veterans in attendance. A parade was held, with Massachusetts Governor Curtis Guild Jr. and Worcester mayor John T. Duggan present, during which the state colors of the 15th Regiment, which had been carried during the Battle of Antietam, were carried. Every post of the Grand Army of the Republic was represented in the parade. Seats on the courthouse steps were set up for many of the veterans, while a speaking platform was built at the top of the steps. The parade, which followed mostly along the city's main street, ended around 10 a.m., with the veterans seated by 10:30 a.m.\nThe speakers assembled at the top of the steps included Governor Guild, Lieutenant Governor Eben Sumner Draper, Secretary of War William Howard Taft, and Chief Justice Marcus Perrin Knowlton and associate justice Henry Braley of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, among others. Shortly before 11 a.m., William Franklin Draper (who had become the head of the commission following Hoar's death in 1904) called the ceremony to order, with Merriman (a reverend) giving a prayer. Following the prayer, Governor Guild gave a speech celebrating Devens and highlighting his contributions to the state, which was followed by a speech by William Draper. Afterwards, Charles Devens Osborne, a grandnephew of Devens, officially unveiled the statue. The band played \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" amidst cheers from the crowd, and afterwards, a member of the county commissioners officially accepted the statue on behalf of the county. Afterwards, William Draper introduced Stewart L. Woodford, a politician and former Union Army officer from New York, as the orator for the ceremony. Following his speech, the band played \"America\", and after the end of the ceremony, veterans were treated to a luncheon in the city's armory. In total, approximately 10,000 spectators were present for the ceremony.\nRecent history.\nIn 1950, during an expansion of the court house building, the statue was moved several feet, and today the statue stands at the intersection of Main Street and Highland Street, still on the court house grounds, overlooking Lincoln Square. In 1994, the monument was surveyed as part of the Save Outdoor Sculpture! project. In 2015, the old court house, which had been vacant since 2008, was sold to developers with the intent to convert the building to apartments. As part of the sale, agreements were made regarding continued historic preservation of the property by the developers, including for the Devens statue. A 2017 article in the \"Telegram &amp; Gazette\" discussing renovations to the building stated that the statue would remain in place in front of the courthouse.\nDesign.\nThe monument consists of a bronze equestrian statue of Devens atop a rectangular granite pedestal. Devens is depicted in his Civil War uniform, partially covered by a heavy coat, with his right hand holding the horse's reigns. The statue stands tall, while the pedestal is approximately tall. The width of the pedestal is approximately . A bronze tablet affixed to the rear of the pedestal bears the following inscription:\nThe inscription on the front of the pedestal reads:\nAdditionally, the commission specified \"[t]hat on the south side of the base the several organizations known as Worcester County Regiments, Battalions and Companies be placed, and on the north side of the base the names of the several cities and towns, with the number of men furnished by each.\" These organizations, inscribed on the left side of the base, are as follows:\nAnalysis.\nArt historian Michael Richman compared the statue to a similar equestrian statue of Ulysses S. Grant created several years earlier by French and Potter in Philadelphia, saying it was \"reminiscent of the \"Grant\" without being imitative.\" In a 2019 work on Civil War memorials in the United States, Thomas J. Brown stated that \"[t]he decision to honor Devens as a military leader typified the recent reconfiguration of American priorities\" and that while Devens \"failed to achieve much battlefield success\", the decision to represent him as a soldier was articulated by Hoar, who said, \"whatever may be said by the philosopher, the moralist, or the preacher, the instincts of the greater portion of mankind will lead them to award the highest meed of admiration to the military character.\" Discussing both the Devens statue and a later equestrian statue French created for William Franklin Draper, Brown argues that \"[i]n French's statues of Devens and Draper, the lawyer and the industrialist blended into the army general, celebrating the extraction of obedience through compulsion.\"\nDiscussing French's works in a 2019 book, historian Harold Holzer stated that \"[b]y the time the Devens statue was dedicated in 1906, the team of French and Potter had clearly established an aesthetically pleasing and financially lucrative formula to portray Civil War 'heroes',\" but that French was growing tired of the genre, pointing out that it would be six years before French created another equestrian statue of a Civil War figure."

The federation removed the feed from its YouTube channel and re-uploaded an edited video without the footage it described as \"objectification of the human body.\" This incident marked the second time in the season that the IFSC apologised for sexualised imagery, after a similar footage of Färber appeared on the live feed of the Innsbruck World Cup in June 2021."

The Panthers represent the University of Northern Iowa in the NCAA's Missouri Valley Conference.\nNorthern Iowa began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1900. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Northern Iowa's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

Additionally, the club's bar is open on match days, and is also responsible for preparing the popular after-match parties.\nThere has been speculation about the possibility of the facilities being demolished to build an underground parking lot that would decongest the area, which lacks parking zones. However, this plan seems to have been rejected temporarily by the Alcobendas city hall.\nRenovations.\nIn 2018 the stadium had several important renovations including the installation of artificial grass, an increase in the width and length of the field to bring it into compliance with official international measurements, as well the construction of a new perimeter zone, new seats, and new floodlight towers. The stadium's roof was completely replaced in 2021 due to sustaining damage during the storm Filomena."

No tournament was held in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2021 season was staged with precautionary measures.\nChanges.\nProfessional status.\nThe Games and Amusements Board in October 2020 issued a directive that it would consider players compensated for non-national team play would be considered as professionals, as well as that for all sporting events organized for profit as professional in nature. This has raised concerns over the status of semi-professional leagues such as the PVL and its rival league, the PSL. The PVL in particular was concerned over financial aspects of running as a professional league.\nIn November 2020, the PVL announced that the league would turn professional starting the 2021 season, believing it has enough women players to make the move. The league was already considering to turn professional due to the collegiate league UAAP deciding to bar its rookies from playing in commercial leagues starting its UAAP Season 81 (2018–19), in anticipation that all college players would not be allowed to play in the PVL. Prior to the league's professionalization, the PVL was considered as semi-professional and thus its affairs are not supervised or regulated by GAB Six PVL teams - BaliPure, Banko Perlas, Choco Mucho, Creamline, Motolite and Petro Gazz - agreed with the move for PVL to turn professional.\nA new separate league called the V-League, in reference to the PVL's old name, will be formed to accommodate collegiate and amateur teams which could no longer take part in the PVL due to the league's professionalization. Prior to the PVL's professionalization, it has hosted the collegiate conference.\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Premier Volleyball League had to secure permit from the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) of the Philippine national government to host games.\nThe Open conference, the only tournament of the 2021 season, was held under a \"bubble\" format with players and staff isolated at the playing venue.\nThe PVL planned to organize at least two conferences, with the second being the Reinforced Conference which allows teams to field foreign players. It was initially cancelled for the 2021 season by May 2021 due to logistical issues of bringing in foreign players due to pandemic-related travel restrictions as well as to accommodate the Philippine women's national team's preparation and participation in the 2021 Southeast Asian Games and the 2021 Asian Women's Volleyball Championship Both tournaments were later postponed to next year. The conduct of a second conference was again considered after the conclusion of the Open Conference. However such plans were again cancelled."

        "text": "The Sri Lanka cricket team toured England in June and July 2021 to play three One Day International (ODI) and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. The ODI series formed part of the inaugural 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League. On 4 June 2021, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) named a 24-man squad to tour England. The tour was initially thrown into doubt the next day, when 38 players signed a statement refusing to sign tour contracts with SLC. After an agreement was reached with the players, SLC confirmed that the tour would go ahead as planned.\nEngland won the first two T20Is, by eight wickets and five wickets, respectively, to win the series with a game to spare. England went on to win the final T20I by 89 runs, winning the series 3–0. England also won the first two ODI matches to win the series. The third ODI finished as a no result, after the match was washed out following the completion of Sri Lanka's innings.\nSquads.\nSri Lanka did not name individual squads for the ODI and T20I matches, opting instead to name a combined squad of 24 players for the tour. Olly Stone was due to be named in England's ODI squad, but was ruled out of the rest of the season with a stress fracture to his back. As a result, George Garton earned his maiden call-up to the England team. England's Jos Buttler suffered a calf tear in the first T20I and was ruled out of the rest of the series. Dawid Malan was added to England's ODI squad as Buttler's replacement. Sri Lanka's Avishka Fernando was ruled out of the ODI series, after suffering a quadriceps tear in the second T20I match. England's Dawid Malan was also ruled out of the ODI series, due to personal reasons. Tom Banton was added to England's squad for the third ODI, as cover for Malan.\nOn 28 June 2021, Sri Lanka Cricket suspended Kusal Mendis, Danushka Gunathilaka and Niroshan Dickwella after they breached the team's bio-secure bubble. All three players were seen in the city centre of Durham, with them all being sent back home ahead of the ODI matches. In July 2021, Sri Lanka Cricket suspended all three of them from playing in international cricket for one year. Sri Lanka Cricket agreed to lift the ban on all three players early, rescinding the punishment in January 2022.\nTour matches.\nAhead of the T20I series, Sri Lanka were scheduled to play two one-day tour matches against Kent and Sussex. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed that Sri Lanka would play intra-squad matches instead. A 50-over match and a 20-over match took place at Old Trafford Cricket Ground.\nStatistics.\nMost wickets (ODI).\nIndian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2021"

        "text": "The Indian cricket team toured England in August and September 2021 to play five Test matches. Prior to their matches against England, India played New Zealand in the 2021 ICC World Test Championship Final at the Rose Bowl in Southampton in June 2021. The Test series were the first matches of the 2021–2023 ICC World Test Championship.\nIn May 2021, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) made a request to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to adjust the schedule of the tour to accommodate the remaining matches of the 2021 Indian Premier League. However, a change would impact on tickets that have already been sold and the need to reschedule matches in The Hundred. On the second day of the third Test, England players wore black armbands in remembrance of former England cricketer Ted Dexter, who died on 25 August 2021. Likewise, on the first day of the fourth Test, Indian players wore black armbands in remembrance of former Indian cricketer Vasoo Paranjape, who died on 30 August 2021.\nThe first Test of the series ended in a draw, after more than two days of play was lost across the duration of the match to rain. India won the second Test by 151 runs, in the final hour of the fifth day, to take a 1–0 lead in the series. England won the third Test by an innings and 76 runs before the lunch break on day four, levelling the series 1–1. It was Joe Root's 27th win as captain, the most by a captain of England in Test cricket. India won the fourth Test by 157 runs, to lead the series 2–1 with one match to play.\nOn the morning of the scheduled start of the fifth Test of the series, both cricket boards confirmed that the match would not start on 10 September 2021, following positive COVID-19 results in the Indian team. The ECB then issued a statement to say that the Test match had been cancelled, as India were unable to field a side. Clarification on the result of the series was sent to the International Cricket Council (ICC), and the match referee Chris Broad. The BCCI issued a statement saying that they were working with the ECB with the aim to reschedule the match. In September 2021, the ECB announced that India would play a one-off Test match in 2022, ahead of India's limited-overs matches against England. The following month, the ECB confirmed that the rescheduled match would determine the outcome of the Test series. After being set a target of 378 runs, England won the fifth Test by seven wickets to record their highest successful run chase in a Test match, with the five-match series being drawn 2–2.\nSquads.\nIndia also named Abhimanyu Easwaran, Prasidh Krishna, Avesh Khan, and Arzan Nagwaswalla as standby players. In May 2021, K. S. Bharat was added to India's squad as cover for Wriddhiman Saha. On 6 July 2021, the BCCI requested that Shubman Gill returned to India after suffering with a stress injury. Prior to the warm-up matches, Rishabh Pant tested positive for COVID-19, and did not travel with the Indian squad to Durham, with Pant remaining in quarantine. After Pant's positive test, four more of India's contingent also tested positive and were quarantined in London for ten days. On 21 July 2021, the ECB announced the 17 member squad for the first two Test matches. On 22 July 2021, Avesh Khan and Washington Sundar were both ruled out of India's squad due to injury. On 25 July 2021, Prithvi Shaw and Suryakumar Yadav were announced as replacements for Gill, Khan, and Sundar. Abhimanyu Easwaran was also added to India's main squad from the group of reserve players. Mayank Agarwal was ruled out of India's squad for the first Test after suffering a concussion during a training session. Prasidh Krishna, one of India's standby players, was added to the main squad for the fourth Test match.\nOn 30 July 2021, England's Ben Stokes announced that he would be taking an \"indefinite break\" from all cricket with immediate effect. Craig Overton was added to England's squad as his replacement. Ahead of the second Test, Moeen Ali was added to England's squad. Saqib Mahmood was also added to England's squad for the second Test, as cover for James Anderson and Stuart Broad. Stuart Broad was later ruled out of the rest of the series after suffering a tear to his right calf. Dom Bess and Ollie Pope were both released from England's squad, allowing them to play in the 2021 Royal London One-Day Cup. Dawid Malan was added to England's squad for the third Test, replacing Dom Sibley. Ollie Pope was recalled to the squad for the match, with Zak Crawley being released. Jack Leach was not included in England's squad, but remained on standby for Moeen Ali. Mark Wood was ruled out of England's squad for the third Test after suffering a shoulder injury in the previous match. Wood and Chris Woakes were recalled to England's squad for the fourth Test. Jos Buttler missed the match due the birth of his second child, with Jonny Bairstow keeping wicket, Sam Billings added as wicket-keeper cover. Moeen Ali was also named as the vice-captain for the match. Saqib Mahmood was released from the squad, allowing him to play in the 2021 County Championship for Lancashire. Billings was released from England's squad during the fourth Test, to play in the 2021 County Championship for Kent. Jos Buttler and Jack Leach were both recalled for the fifth Test.\nIn January 2022, following India's third Test match against South Africa, Virat Kohli announced that he had stepped down as India's captain in Test cricket. On 22 May 2022, the BCCI named their squad for the rescheduled match against England, with Rohit Sharma leading the Test side. In June 2022, Mayank Agarwal was added to India's squad for the fifth Test, after Rohit Sharma tested positive for COVID-19. On 29 June 2022, Rohit Sharma again tested positive for COVID-19, with him undertaking two further tests to confirm his availability for the fifth Test. KL Rahul was ruled out of India's squad for the fifth Test after undergoing surgery for a hernia. Sharma was ruled out of the match, with Jasprit Bumrah named as India's captain and Rishabh Pant as the team's vice-captain.\nOn 27 June 2022, shortly after the conclusion of the series against New Zealand, England confirmed their squad for the fifth Test. Ben Foakes was ruled out of the match after failing to recover from COVID-19.\nWarm-up match.\nAhead of the Test series, India were scheduled to play two intra-squad warm-up matches against India A. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed that India would play two intra-squad four-day matches instead, with India travelling with a larger squad. Two first-class matches were planned against county teams, but were initially replaced with intra-squad matches in Durham. On 14 July 2021, both cricket boards agreed to a three-day match against a County Select XI side as part of India's preparation for the Test series. Will Rhodes of Warwickshire was named as the captain of the County Select XI team."

The field for the Derby is limited to 20 horses, with up to four 'also eligibles' in case of a late withdrawal from the field. There were three separate paths for horses to take to qualify for the Derby: the main Road consisting of races in North America (plus one in Dubai), the Japan Road consisting of four races in Japan, and seven European races in England, Ireland and France. The top four finishers in the specified races received points, with higher points awarded in the major prep races in March and April. Earnings in non-restricted stakes races acted as a tie breaker.\nThe 2020 Road to the Kentucky Derby suffered major disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the postponement of the 2020 Derby itself to September. For 2021, the main Road to the Kentucky Derby will instead resemble the 2019 Road to the Kentucky Derby, consisting of 36 races, 20 races for the Kentucky Derby Prep Season and 16 races for the Kentucky Derby Championship Season except for the following changes:\nFor the 2021 Road to the Kentucky Derby, horses which ran in qualifying events with the medication furosemide (Lasix) did not receive any qualification points.\nStandings.\nThe following table shows the points earned in the eligible races for the main series and the leaderboard rank as of April 25. The Kentucky Derby was won by Mandaloun, who qualified in a Sixth place finished in the Louisiana Derby.

As a result, the Eagles did not compete in any tournaments, including the annual Beanpot championship, which would have been in its 69th year of competition.\nThe Eagles finished the season 17–6–1, and 16–4–1 in conference play, good for 1st place in Hockey East, however, no regular season title was officially awarded due to disparate scheduling among the conference. They advanced to the semifinals of the Hockey East tournament where they lost 5–6 in double overtime to the UMass Lowell River Hawks. Boston College returned to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2016, as the top seed of the Northeast Regional hosted in Albany, New York. Their first round meeting with Notre Dame was ruled a no-contest as the Fighting Irish were forced to withdraw from the tournament due to COVID-19 protocols, and the Eagles advanced to the Regional final via forfeit. There, they were defeated by the St. Cloud State Huskies by a score of 1–4.\nPrevious season recap.\nThe Eagles entered the 2020–21 season following a strong 2019–20 effort. With a 24–8–2 record, going 17–6–1 in conference play, the Eagles finished first in Hockey East and captured their 20th regular season title; rebounding from a 7th-place finish in the previous year. However, that would be the only post-season trophy possible to earn, as both the Hockey East and NCAA tournaments were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic before any games were played. The Eagles were a likely NCAA tournament qualifier which would have ended a three-year drought from the nationals. Additionally, they failed to secure any mid-season tournament title, their only tournament result being their third-place Beanpot finish.\nDepartures.\nThirteen Eagles departed from the program from the 2019–20 roster:\nGraduation:\nSigned Professionally:\nNot Retained:\nMid-Season Departures:\nRecruiting.\nBoston College added eleven freshmen for the 2020–21 season: six forwards, four defensemen, and a goalie. Additionally, sophomore forward Liam Izyk transferred into the program from the Alabama–Huntsville Chargers.\nAdditionally, some mid-season roster additions occurred during the winter break:\n2020–2021 roster.\n2020–21 Eagles.\nAs of January 9, 2021.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"; | Regular season\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"; | \n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | \n† Notre Dame was forced to withdraw from the regional semifinal match on March 27, as the team received multiple positive COVID tests on March 25.

Thompson's primary position is Flyhalf. Thompson has previously played for the Ayrshire Bulls.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nThompson played for Glasgow Hawks. He made 14 appearances for the first team in 2017-18 season scoring 21 pts including 1 try and 10 appearances in 2018-19 season scoring 21 points. Peter Horne coached him at the club:\nWhen he came out of school, I coached him at Glasgow Hawks for a year, and I couldn’t believe how far ahead he was of where I would have been at his age. He had such a polished kicking game, he had a really nice passing game, and he was pretty studious – anything you asked him to do, he’d go away and learn it and come back – so he was just a good all-round player.\nProfessional career.\nThompson was signed by the Ayrshire Bulls to play in the Super 6 league in 2019. He scored 61 points for the club in the 2019-20 season, the 3rd highest points scorer in the league that season.\nThompson signed for Glasgow Warriors in 2021. He made his debut for Glasgow Warriors in Round 10 of the 2021–22 URC against coming on as a replacement on 2 January 2021. He became Glasgow Warrior No. 319. He won man of the match in his first start for the club. He became the third fastest player to reach 100 points for the Warriors, with a conversion in the URC match against Leinster on 4 June 2021, 153 days after his competitive debut. (Tommy Hayes with a competitive debut on 8 September 1997 secured his 100 points on 24 October 1997. This was only 77 days. Dan Parks with a competitive debut on 19 September 2003 secured his 100 points on 16 January 2004, totalling 119 days. Thompson is one of only 4 Warriors in history to break the 100 points milestone in their debut season for the club, the other being Calvin Howarth who reached that total in 189 days.) He would go on to add to this in the match with a penalty that secured the win over the Irish provincial Leinster side, with Glasgow winning 15-12. He won Young Player of the Season for the 2021-22 season in the annual Glasgow Warriors awards; and then was later announced to also win the Player of the Season award too, becoming the second player to win both the Young Player and Player of the Season award in the same season; George Horne pulling off the same feat in the 2017-18 season.\nInternational career.\nThompson has been capped by Scotland U20. In June 2021 he was called up to the Scotland squad for the Summer internationals.\nThompson made his Scotland debut against Tonga on 30 October 2021. Scotland won the match 60 - 14, Thompson scoring 2 conversions.\nHe was capped by Scotland 'A' on 25 June 2022 in their match against Chile.\nFamily.\nThompson's grandfather Eric Thompson represented Scotland at cricket; his uncle Graeme Thompson represented Scotland at rugby league; and his cousin Kirsty Gilmour is a Commonwealth Games medalist for Scotland in Badminton."

The ODI series formed part of the inaugural 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League. Bangladesh last toured Zimbabwe in April and May 2013. Originally, two Test matches were scheduled to be played on the tour, but one of the Tests was replaced with an additional T20I match.\nDespite the suspension of sporting activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Zimbabwe's Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) gave its permission for the tour to go ahead. In June 2021, the tour itinerary was confirmed by Zimbabwe Cricket, with all the matches being played in a bio-secure environment at the Harare Sports Club behind closed doors.\nThe Bangladesh cricket team arrived in Zimbabwe on 30 June 2021, following a twelve-team T20 tournament in Bangladesh. During the one-off Test match, Bangladesh's Mahmudullah announced his retirement from Test cricket. Bangladesh went on to win the Test match by 220 runs. Bangladesh won the first ODI by 155 runs, and the second match by three wickets, to win the series with a match to spare. Bangladesh won the third ODI by five wickets to win the series 3–0.\nOn 19 July 2021, both cricket boards agreed to a minor reschedule of the T20I fixtures. The end date of the tour was brought forward by two days, due to \"scheduling and logistical challenges\".\nThe first T20I match of the series was also the 100th T20I to be played by Bangladesh. With their eight-wicket victory, they became the third team, after Australia and Pakistan, to win their 100th match in all three formats of international cricket. Zimbabwe won the second T20I match by 23 runs to level the series with one match to play. Bangladesh won the third T20I match by five wickets to take the series 2–1.\nSquads.\nThree days after the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) had named the squads for the tour, Mahmudullah was added to Bangladesh's Test squad. Initially, Mahmudullah had not been included in the Test squad after not being able to bowl due to an injury. After initially opting out of the T20I matches, Bangladesh's Mushfiqur Rahim made himself available for the fixtures. However, he later pulled out of the ODI and T20I squads due to family reasons. Tamim Iqbal was ruled out of Bangladesh's T20I squad due to a knee injury.\nSean Williams was initially named as Zimbabwe's captain for the one-off Test. However, Williams and Craig Ervine both had to go into self-isolation, after being in close-contact with an individual who was COVID-19 positive. As a result, Brendan Taylor was named as Zimbabwe's captain for the match. Taylor was also named as captain of Zimbabwe's ODI team, with Williams and Ervine continuing to isolate. Brendan Taylor was rested for the T20I fixtures with Sikandar Raza named as Zimbabwe's captain for the matches."

It was the first bilateral T20I series between the two teams, and England's first tour of Bangladesh since 2016.\nOriginally, the tour was scheduled to take place in September and October 2021, with the T20I matches having been used as preparation for the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. However, in August 2021, the tour was postponed due to fixture congestion and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) confirmed that they were in talks with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to reschedule the matches before the cut-off time of the Super League. On 3 August 2021, the ECB confirmed that the tour had been re-arranged for March 2023. On 27 December 2022, both BCB and ECB confirmed the fixtures of the tour. However, later in January 2023, the tour's practice matches were cancelled by the ECB due to non-availability of several players and a busy international schedule.\nEngland won the ODI series with 2–1 margin, ending Bangladesh's 7 years unbeaten run in ODI series at home since 2016.\nBangladesh won the first T20I match of the series, which was their first win against England and their 50th win in T20Is.

        "text": "Marty Howe was a Canadian-born, American ice hockey defenseman who was a two-time All-American for Denver and helped the team win consecutive national championships in the early 1960s.\nCareer.\nHowe grew up in Regina and played for his home town junior team, the Regina Pats. He helped the club win consecutive Abbott Cups in 1955 and '56. After a bid for a third title in his final season went unfulfilled, Howe matriculated south and began attending the University of Denver in 1957. As most players did, Howe spent his first year on the freshman team as the NCAA only allowed three seasons of varsity play for student athletes. Howe watched the Pioneers win their first national championship in 1958 and knew he would have a chance to win one himself the following year.\nThat offseason, the WIHL dissolved as a result of a disagreement between schools over recruiting practices. Howe was one of many players used by teams like Denver or North Dakota who arrived from Canada as over-aged athletes (20 years old or more) and some in the conference, particularly Minnesota, took issue with that policy. As a result, Denver was an independent program for the 1959 season and produced a stellar record, going 22–5–1. Unfortunately, due to the ease of their schedule, Denver was left out of the NCAA tournament despite possessing the best record of any western team.\nThe result was a swift mending of fences and the WIHL reconstituted as the WCHA. Marty Howe, now a junior, was a star of the team, the conference and college ice hockey as a whole when he was named as the most outstanding defenseman for Denver in 1960, named to the inaugural All-WCHA First Team, and earned the first of his two All-American honors. Howe helped Denver finish atop their conference and then win both conference tournament games to earn the inaugural conference co-championship. The Pioneers received the top western seed for the NCAA tournament and won two fairly close contests to capture their second national title. Howe assisted on John MacMillan's game-winning goal with just under a minute to play and earned a spot on the All-Tournament First Team.\nAs an encore, Marty Howe helped Denver produce one of the most outstanding seasons in the history of college hockey. Denver became the first team to win 30 games in a season by going 30–1–1 and was recognized by having five players named to the six spots on both the All-WCHA First Team and the All-American West Team. Howe's named appeared on both lists for the second consecutive season and he aided the Pioneers in their defense of a conference championship. Howe's team returned to the NCAA tournament as the heavy favorite and Denver did not disappoint. Denver dropped Minnesota 6–1 in the semifinal and then produced the most lopsided victory in NCAA championship history with a 12–2 drubbing of St. Lawrence. Despite the huge number of goals scored, Howe did not record a point in the title game but he was named to the All-Tournament First Team nonetheless.\nAfter graduating with a degree in accounting, Howe continued his playing career. He appeared briefly with the Pittsburgh Hornets before travelling west and spending several seasons in the Western Hockey League. Howe retired in 1964 but returned three years later as a member of the US National Team. He played at the 1967 Ice Hockey World Championships and finished tied for second in team scoring with 5 points in 7 games. The team finished 5th, a slight improvement over the previous year, but not good enough to keep Howe for another tournament.\nHowe was inducted into the Denver Athletic Hall of Fame in 2001.\nPersonal.\nMarty met his wife Diane while at Denver and the pair raised three daughters, Vanessa, Melissa and Diedre."

He coached the football team to conference titles in every year as well as three Western regional titles, winning the state championship in 1950. Johnson led the school's basketball team to state championship titles in 1947, 1948, 1949 and 1950.

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Terriers represent the Wofford College in the NCAA's Southern Conference.\nWofford began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1906. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Wofford's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

Rugby league is a new sport in Albania, which has been officially registered since 2017. The popularity of rugby league is struggling for attention in the national media. However, since the creation of the ARL national team and the introduction of Tirana Rugby Club (founded in 2013) in the Greek championship, coverage has increased with articles appearing in different rugby league official forums and newspapers.\nHistory.\nAlthough not formal at the time, the first steps of this non-profit organization were made back in 2010. Initially, a rugby union team (Tirana RC) was founded by two pupils of a central high-school in the city of Tirana. Facing difficulties in recruiting new players, due to the high number of players required in a rugby union game, a switch from rugby union to rugby league ensued in 2017. In 2018 as part of the festival of rugby league surrounding the U19 European Championships in Belgrade, the Albania National Team also participated in the 9s tournament. In 2018 Albanian Rugby League was also granted the observer status, becoming the 39th member nation of RLEF. In 2019 the ARL played against GB Pioneers, a team consisting of students from top universities across Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nGoverning Body.\nAlbanian Rugby League is the governing body in rugby league in Albania, managing development and participation at all levels in the sport.\nCompetitions.\nSince the creation of the ARL, the team has taken part in a few competitions in the Balkans."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Hawks represent University of Hartford in the NCAA Division III Commonwealth Coast Conference.\nHartford began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1949. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Hartford's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2021–22 season."

        "text": "The UK Open Billiards Championship, formerly known as the United Kingdom Professional English Billiards Championship, is an English billiards tournament, first contested in 1934. Joe Davis won the inaugural UK Professional English Billiards Championship title with a 18,745–18,309 defeat of Tom Newman. The tournament was originally organised by the Billiards Association and Control Council (BA&amp;CC). After a dispute over a world championship challenge match, the Professional Billiard Players Association (PBPA) — which had been re-established in 1968 by reigning world billiards champion Rex Williams and seven other players – disaffiliated from the BA&amp;CC. The PBPA changed its name to the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) in 1970, and declared itself the governing body for the professional games of snooker and English billiards.\nAfter 1934, the UK Championship was the premier event of the billiards season in the UK, in the absence of any contests for the world championships. Walter Lindrum had won the World Professional Championship in 1933, and insisted that the competition should be held in Australia for his defence. Lindrum retained the world championship in 1934, and it was not contested again until 1952. The Championship was staged three more times before being in abeyance from 1952 to 1978. After a further hiatus from 2002, World Billiards, a WPBSA-affiliated organisation, reinstituted the tournament as an open event in 2015. From 1987, it has sometimes been played as a \"short format\" event, for example in January 1988 the matches before the final were the best-of-seven games of 150-up (i.e. the first player to reach 150 points won the game), and the final was the best-of-thirteen games of 150-up.\nDavid Causier won the 2019 title, with a 632–315 victory over Mark Hirst in the final. The competition was cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and, as of April 2023, has not been held since. The tournament has been staged 35 times and produced 17 different champions. Mike Russell has won the title a record eight times, one more than Joe Davis's total. Causier has taken three titles, and the only other players to have won the tournament more than once are two-time champions Williams, Robby Foldvari, and Roxton Chapman.\nReferences.\nCitations\nBibliography"

He also represented Germany's senior national team at the 1994 FIBA World Championship and at the 1995 EuroBasket.\nCollege career.\nA 6'6\" small forward, King was a walk-on at Bucknell who earned a scholarship after great improvement. As a freshman he played on the school's junior varsity team, and by midway through his sophomore year he earned a spot on the varsity squad. In 1990–91, his junior year, he earned a spot on the All-Patriot League Second Team. The following year, his senior season, King averaged 20.3 points per game, helped the Bison win the conference championship, and was named the Patriot League Player of the Year. In just a little over two seasons of varsity basketball King scored over 1,000 career points. King is the school- and Patriot League-record holder for field-goal percentage in a season (.670; 1990–91) and career (.638). In 2006 he was inducted into Bucknell's Athletics Hall of Fame, and in 2015 he was selected to the Patriot League Men's Basketball 25th Anniversary Team.\nProfessional career.\nKing went undrafted in the 1992 NBA draft after his time at Bucknell drew to a close, so he returned to Germany to compete professionally. His nine-year career spanned from 1992 to 2001, and all but one of the clubs he played for was located in his homeland. Only Panathinaikos Limassol, which is in Cyprus, was the geographical outlier.\nHe also represented the German national team in the 1994 FIBA World Championship and the 1995 EuroBasket. In the FIBA World Championship he averaged 1.7 points, 0.7 rebounds, and 0.2 assists, while in EuroBasket he averaged 0.7 points, 0.7 rebounds, and 0.3 assists per game."

Lenglen, a six-time Wimbledon singles champion who was undefeated in singles at the tournament, defeated Dewhurst in straight sets for the last competitive win of her amateur career. The match had been rescheduled three times. Lenglen withdrew from the tournament following the match and also forfeited her amateur status a month after the tournament to become a professional tennis player.\nThe match was enshrouded in controversy after it needed to be rescheduled to accommodate the British royal family. As Lenglen did not think the rescheduled time fit in with her doubles match, she asked for the match to be rescheduled again. Although it never was, Lenglen did not show up at the rescheduled time. As a result, tournament officials ultimately rescheduled the match anyway, moving it to the following day to be played following her doubles match. After her doubles match took longer than anticipated to complete, the singles match was rescheduled a third time again to the following day. Although Lenglen won the match, the British crowd that had long been extremely supportive of Lenglen turned against her after the press erroneously reported the postponements had angered Queen Mary, even though Queen Mary was supportive of Lenglen in the situation. Lenglen's fallout with the British crowd was one of the underlying factors in her leaving amateur tennis.\nLenglen's unwillingness to comply with the first rescheduled time of the match was in part due to two other separate issues, namely her family struggling with their finances and the French Tennis Federation demanding that she partner with a compatriot instead of her longtime doubles partner American Elizabeth Ryan.\nBackground.\nThe 1926 Wimbledon Championships were known as the Jubilee Championships to commemorate the 50th edition of the tournament. Suzanne Lenglen entered the tournament on a 179-match win streak in singles and notably defeated her main competitive rival American Helen Wills earlier in the year in the Match of the Century in their only ever encounter. Shortly before Wimbledon, Wills unexpectedly needed to withdraw due to appendicitis. Although Lenglen was a heavy favourite with Wills not participating, the tournament began with two issues. With her father ill and her family expending money, Lenglen's finances were more of a concern than they had been in previous years. For previous Wimbledon tournaments, national tennis associations would pay top players more than what they needed to cover their travel expenses so they could earn money while maintaining their amateur status. However, in 1926, the Wimbledon club covered the travel expenses of top players without giving them anything extra. Meanwhile, the French Tennis Federation wanted Lenglen to enter the doubles event with a French partner in Julie Vlasto rather than her usual partner, Elizabeth Ryan. Lenglen preferred to enter with Ryan even though she had partnered Vlasto at the previous two French Championships in Ryan's absence. Although she agreed to play with Vlasto, the situation later worsened. Lenglen became unsettled by being drawn against Ryan in her opening doubles match. In the lead-up to this match, Lenglen and Ryan played an exhibition set of doubles together with Queen Mary in attendance to celebrate the start of the Jubilee Championships. They were surprisingly defeated 6–8 by McKane and Kea Bouman, despite having only lost one set together in open competition in their careers.\nMatch details.\nLenglen's situation did not improve once the tournament began. She opened the singles event with an uncharacteristic win against Browne in which she lost five games, the same number she had lost in the entire 1925 singles event. She was originally supposed to play the doubles match against Ryan at 4:30 PM the following day, followed by her second singles match of the day. However, her singles match was moved to 2:00 PM before the doubles match to accommodate the royal family who planned to be in attendance. Lenglen was not informed of the change until the next morning. She did not want to play the singles before her more important doubles, and did not want to play at 2:00 PM because she had a doctor's appointment at the time. Lenglen asked her regular mixed doubles partner Jacques Brugnon to tell the tournament referee to reschedule the singles match. He never received the message. By the time Lenglen arrived on the grounds at 3:30 PM, Queen Mary and the rest of the crowd were waiting over an hour. After Wimbledon officials confronted her in anger, she refused to play either match.\nNeither the officials, nor Lenglen's opponents wanted her defaulted. As a result, the club adhered to Lenglen's wishes and rescheduled both matches the following day, with the doubles first. Nonetheless, Lenglen and Vlasto were defeated by Ryan and her partner Mary Browne in three sets, despite having three match points when they were ahead 7–6 in the second set. The crowd who had typically supported Lenglen were against her, in part as a result of a fabricated story in the newspaper that Lenglen had angered Queen Mary. With the long duration of the match, the singles was again delayed until the following day. Although Lenglen defeated Evelyn Dewhurst in the match, she lost four games, far more than anyone expected.\nAftermath.\nAfter the match, Lenglen played and won her opening mixed doubles match before withdrawing from both singles and mixed doubles due to a shoulder injury. Lenglen ultimately decided that this was her last amateur tournament, ending her career in the midst of a 179-match win streak, having not lost since 1921. A month later, she signed a $50,000 contract with American sports promotor C. C. Pyle to turn professional and headline an exhibition tour in the United States. After that tour was a financial success, Lenglen headlined another shorter tour in the United Kingdom a few months later. Dewhurst also turned professional to join Lenglen on that second tour.\nIn the wake of Lenglen's withdrawal from the tournament, Kitty Godfree won her second Wimbledon title. In Lenglen's absence from amateur tennis in the coming years, Helen Wills established herself as the best women's tennis player in the world, winning the next four editions of Wimbledon in particular. Although Lenglen retired from professional tennis the following year, she never regained her amateur status and a rematch of the Match of the Century with Wills never materialized."

        "title": "Monkey Before Skeleton",
        "text": "Monkey Before Skeleton (German:Affe vor Skelett) is the title of a painting by the Bohemian painter Gabriel von Max from around 1900. The 61 cm × 44.5 cm large work of art, painted with oil paints on canvas, shows a monkey facing a skeleton against the backdrop of a darkened interior. As part of Max's late work, the motif of the monkey can be found in a number of other depictions, which were created from 1871 until the artist's death in 1915. The painting is now in private ownership in Hamburg.\nImage description.\nThe standing rhesus monkey is positioned frontally and in close proximity to the skeleton, which the viewer in front of the painting can only see from the rear. The monkey tied to the lower body is held in the moment of movement with economical but curious gestures. With his left hand he supports himself on the written notes and papers on the table in front of him. His right, on the other hand, appears less active and, in its angled and curled position, flatters more of the monkey's characteristic nature. A black quill pen is placed on the inscribed booklet, close to hand.\nThe skeleton is that of a juvenile chimpanzee. It is bent slightly forward in a similar posture, but is stabilized by a rod at the end of the spine. An inkwell and written leaves are shown in the center of the picture, which is framed by the primate and skeleton on the side. A striking red book can be seen through the skeleton. This motif is continued with two further books bound in red, ascending towards the back.\nIn the background, there are also a multitude of bound writings and loose sheets of paper on the table and shelves, which end in shadowy outlines with increasing distance and darkness of the room.\nImage interpretation.\nDifferentiating from the medieval use of the monkey motif to indicate rascality or instinctuality, the primacy is shown here as a thinker who explores a skeleton. Lost in thought, the monkey's gaze turns slightly cross-eyed on the skeleton, which as a vanitas symbol indicates its own transience. It can be recognized as the object and result of research that is now next to the labeled sheet of evolution. The author of the documents shown remains uncertain.\nComparable to a monkey in front of a skeleton, color fidelity and attention to detail are decisive elements in most of his monkey paintings, which suggest naturalness and testify to the artist's recourse to living as well as prepared animals as study models. From 1870 the painter kept a group of monkeys in his own household, which he observed and studied. Detailed descriptions of their behavior, their cognitive progress and illnesses emerged. Many animals died due to the weather conditions in Munich, with the artist nailing some of the dead animals to wood to use as models for his paintings. Dissections too were carried out by him and then recorded in drawings. Some of the monkeys were given names such as his favorites Paly and Puk, who at times also wore clothes and ate at the same table. However, the artist did not travel to non-European countries, as he noted in his notebook from 1908: \"I never got beyond Europe's cultural savages.\"\nDespite the artist's concern to reproduce the nature of the monkeys realistically, as evidenced by the fine color transitions and accents of light, the painting Monkey in front of a skeleton looks a bit glossed over. This suggests the high rank and influence of history painting at the time . However, the monkey was no longer portrayed as an actor in the role of man, as was the case with the clothed monkeys of the Singerien, for example was common, but perceived as living beings with abilities that are hardly or not at all preserved in the human disposition. The boundaries between humans and animals are explored in more detail, whereby it is now also important to grasp the essence and thus the truthfulness of the monkey. Nevertheless, the reality shown is constructed in the painting, whereby the symbolic content of the primate persists in a modified form.\nAs a collector and intellectual, Gabriel von Max combined art with science in order to address issues of human ancestry and further development. Shortly before, the German sculptor Hugo Rheinhold followed a similar approach, who set similar thematic priorities (bronze sculpture of a monkey with a skull, 1892).\nClassification and literary models.\nExploring the origins of man is a crucial component in Gabriel von Max's oeuvre. However, this backward-looking search is associated with a belief in the future that is based on technical innovation, such as the discovery of X-rays in 1895, and Darwinian theories. Various publications by Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck, Charles Darwin, Thomas Henry Huxley and the German zoologist Ernst Haeckels serve as literary sources . The latter creates a lively exchange of letters to discuss current studies, which also expresses mutual respect and admiration. Ernst Haeckel received the painting on his 60th birthday Pithecanthropus alalus, which finds its place in its private rooms.\nAs far as visions and visions of the future are concerned, however, the artist's interest in occultism and spiritualism should also be pointed out, which particularly determines the artist's first creative phase. As a strict opponent of vivisection, he continued to write down his observations and studies on the basis of notes throughout his life. The artist wrote in a letter to his youngest son Corneille Max on September 5, 1899 : \"Now the natural scientists and vivisectors are meeting in Munich - these materialists all have a lot to answer for: the miserableness of Christianity is the result.\" The artist's aversion to epistemological materialism is clear here and expressing pure rationality. The monkey paintings are therefore on the one hand to be understood as documentation of his scientific work, which serves the continuation of the research topics, but on the other hand also illustrate psychological and spiritual ideas.\nThe relationship between humans and the environment is characterized by great advances in the area of zoology and the keeping and protection of animals in the 19th century . Gabriel von Max therefore proclaims, among other things, a closer relationship to nature and the animal world, which puts the existing hierarchical thinking of people behind, but does not inhibit scientific progress. Arthur Schopenhauer's writings are therefore also groundbreaking. In 1841, in his essay On the Basics of Morality, he formulated a new compassionate understanding of values towards other living beings."

As a result of the ban, WADA plans to allow individually cleared Russian athletes to take part in the 2021-2022 World Championships and 2022 Winter Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but they will not be permitted to compete in team sports. The title of the neutral banner has yet to be determined; WADA Compliance Review Committee head Jonathan Taylor stated that the IOC would not be able to use \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR) as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes cannot be portrayed as representing a specific country. Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the WADA decision. The Court of Arbitration for Sport, on review of Russia's appeal of its case from WADA, ruled on December 17, 2020 to reduce the penalty that WADA had placed. Instead of banning Russia from sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but for a period of two years, the team cannot use the Russian name, flag, or anthem and must present themselves as \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\". The ruling does allow for team uniforms to display \"Russia\" on the uniform as well as the use of the Russian flag colors within the uniform's design, although the name should be up to equal predominance as the \"Neutral Athlete/Team\" designation.\nMedal summary.\nPrize money.\nThe sums written are per medalist, bringing the total prizes awarded to 798,000€ for the individual events and 200,000€ for the team event.

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Penguins represent the Youngstown State University in the NCAA's Horizon League.\nYoungstown State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1927. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Youngstown State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

The list does not include Negro league players who only played in the minor leagues and White Hispanic players who played in both the Negro Leagues and MLB prior to full integration (ex. Pedro Dibut).\nPre-integration players.\nMajor League Baseball was segregated from 1887 through 1946. The integration of Major League Baseball happened at the beginning of the 1947 MLB season when Jackie Robinson played his first game for the Brooklyn Dodgers. By the 1950s, enough black talent had integrated into the formerly \"white\" leagues (both major and minor) that the Negro leagues themselves had become a minor league circuit.\nBelow is a list of 52 players who played for major Negro league teams up to 1950 and eventually saw playing time for a Major League team. Of these, nine have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame and two of them (Greason and Mays) are still alive.\nPost-integration players.\nAn additional 35 or so players played on a Negro league team after 1950.

It was an association of American football clubs that operated from 1959 to 1961 that were mostly based in Ohio, but had some teams from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, and Canada. During its existence the AFC operated between semi-professional and minor league level (varied per team). After playing as a semi-professional league for the 1959 and 1960 seasons, the AFC became a minor professional league for the 1961 season.\nThe Columbus Colts played in the AFC in 1960, then left to help form the United Football League in 1961. A new franchise called the Ohio Colts replaced Columbus in the AFC for 1961.\nThe three biggest teams in the circuit were Toledo Tornadoes and Duquesne Ironmen that would join the United Football League and the Atlantic Coast Football League (respectively) and the Sarnia Golden Bears that had survived the collapse of the Ontario Rugby Football Union. Sarnia won the AFC's last championship after beating Toledo in three overtimes, the longest title game in pro football history.\nThe formation of the UFL and ACFL diminished the level of play, and although the circuit did not immediately die out, after 1961 it was now a purely semi-professional circuit, and the league dissolved entirely before the 1962 season.\n1960.\nLarry Buckles (HB, Columbus) was the offensive MVP, Stan Jones (LB, Columbus) was the defensive MVP.\n1961.\nChampionship Game: Sarnia 39, Toledo 33 (3OT)"

        "text": "Wimbledon power station supplied electricity to the Borough of Wimbledon and the surrounding area from 1899 to 1968. The power station was developed by the Wimbledon Corporation which operated it up to 1933. The London and Home Counties Joint Electricity Authority operated the station from 1933 until the nationalisation of the British electricity supply industry in 1948. It was redeveloped by the owners several times to meet the increased demand for electricity.\nHistory.\nWimbledon Corporation applied in 1897 for a Provisional Order under the \"Electric Lighting Acts\" to generate and supply electricity to Borough of Wimbledon. An Order was granted by the Board of Trade and was confirmed by Parliament through the \"Electric Lighting Orders Confirmation (No. 2) Act 1897\" (60 &amp; 61 Vict. c. lxii). The power station was built in Durnsford Road, Wimbledon (51°25’52”N, 0°11’33”W) and was commissioned in 1899. Further Provisional Orders were granted in 1903 and 1911.\nDuring the general strike in 1926, 113 employees of the Wimbledon electricity undertaking went on strike. Seven of the leaders were refused re-employment, whereas the 60 staff who had not gone on strike were rewarded with a bonus of £368.\nThe British electricity supply industry was nationalised in 1948 under the provisions of the \"Electricity Act 1947\" (10 &amp; 11 Geo. 6 c. 54). The Wimbledon electricity undertaking and London and Home Counties Joint Electricity Authority were abolished, ownership of Wimbledon power station was vested in the British Electricity Authority, and subsequently the Central Electricity Authority and the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB).

        "text": "The South Florida Bulls volleyball team represents the University of South Florida in the sport of women's volleyball. The Bulls compete in the American Athletic Conference of NCAA Division I. The team plays their home games at The Corral inside the Yuengling Center on USF's campus in Tampa, Florida. They are coached by Jolene Shepardson who was hired after the 2019 season. The Bulls have reached seven NCAA women's volleyball tournaments and won a combined 18 regular season and tournament conference championships in their history, the most of any women's team at USF.\nHistory.\nLike many women's sports teams in colleges across the country, the USF women's volleyball team was founded in 1972 after the passing of Title IX. The NCAA did not sponsor women's sports at the time, so the Lady Brahmans as they were known until 1987 played in the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) Small College Division (equivalent to NCAA Division II) for their first year and the AIAW Large College Division (equivalent to NCAA Division I) from 1973 until the association dissolved after the spring of 1982.\nThe Brahmans played as independents as members of the AIAW, as well as during their first year in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). They joined USF's men's teams in the Sun Belt Conference before their 1983 season, and they won their first conference championship that year.\nThe program was very successful in the years directly after they joined the NCAA. In the first 21 seasons after the AIAW's collapse, USF won all of their 11 regular season conference titles and seven conference tournaments, as well as making each of their seven NCAA women's volleyball tournament appearances. They have also made the National Invitational Volleyball Championship (formerly called the Women's Invitational Volleyball Championship) four times, including a quarterfinal appearance in 1994 and semifinal appearance in 2023.\nIn 1995 the team moved from the old USF Gymnasium, where it had called home since the team was founded in 1972, to The Corral, a volleyball-specific area within the Yuengling Center with a capacity of about 1,000. The Bulls also play some home games on the main floor of the Yuengling Center (used for the men's and women's basketball teams), particularly rivalry games and games against ranked opponents.\nThe Bulls have not seen much success recently and have not won a conference championship or reached the NCAA Tournament since 2002, though they won the AAC East Division in 2023.\nUSF Athletic Hall of Fame.\nTwo former volleyball players are members of the University of South Florida Athletic Hall of Fame. Michelle Collier played from 1998 to 2002, owns seven school records, and has her number 10 jersey hanging from the rafters in The Corral. She was inducted in 2011. Erika Berggren played from 1993–96 and was named conference player of the year twice. She was inducted in 2022.\nMedia.\nUnder the current American Athletic Conference TV deal, all home and in-conference away volleyball games are shown on one of the various ESPN networks or streamed live on ESPN+. Live radio broadcasts of games are also available worldwide for free on the Bulls Unlimited digital radio station on TuneIn."

        "text": "Larry Graham was an American college basketball coach and the former men's head coach at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE). He remains the SIUE leader in both total wins and winning percentage.\nPlaying career.\nYoung Larry \"Buddy\" Graham of Scotland, Indiana played at tiny Odon High School (since consolidated into North Daviess Junior-Senior High School) in nearby Odon, Indiana. He set records at Odon High School for most career points (1,387) and rebounds (929), and helped lead the Bulldogs to their first-ever sectional and regional championships. Odon lost to New Albany in the quarterfinals of Indiana's single-division state tournament. The loss came in Indiana's last game played with a sudden death ending.\nGraham played in college for Vincennes University in Vincennes, Indiana, and then for Texas Wesleyan University in Ft. Worth.\nCoaching history.\nAfter several seasons as an assistant high school coach in Indiana and Illinois, in 1969, Graham was named the head coach at Madison High School in Madison, Illinois. In fifteen seasons under Coach Graham, the Madison Trojans won 312 games versus only 103 loses. The school won the Illinois High School Association Class A State Championship in 1977 and 1981--- the second title coming the year after a fourth place finish. He was named Illinois Class A coach of the year in both championship seasons. Graham's Trojans played their way into the eight-team State Finals five times. They won 24 games or more eight times in Graham's fifteen seasons, and they won nine straight Class A regional titles from 1975–76 through 1983–84.\nIn 1981, SIUE had hired Tom Pugliese to build its program toward moving to Division I. While going 17–40 in two seasons, Pugliese and his staff committed so many violations of NCAA rules that the university took the almost unheard of action of suspending the program for at least the 1982–83 season.\nIn 1984, Graham left Madison to coach Florissant Valley Community College. However, when SIUE announced the return of its program, Graham applied for and was hired as head coach. (He would later return to coach Flo Valley.)\nA 7–21 inaugural season was highlighted by the December 1984 opening of the Vadalabene Center, which remains as the home of SIUE basketball. Graham's Cougars were 23–7 in 1985–86 and advanced to the school's first NCAA Division II men's basketball tournament. That was the first of what became seven consecutive winning seasons under Graham and eight overall. The Cougars advanced to the NCAA Tournament again in 1987 and 1989. Under Coach Graham, the Cougars won 147 games while losing only 84, a winning percentage of 63.6%. Graham's win total and winning percentage remain as the best in the SIUE men's basketball program's history.\nAfter Graham stepped down at SIUE, he did not stay out of coaching. He served as head coach at Oakville (MO) High School and at Florissant Valley Community College, adding another 347 wins to his record. Late in his career, Graham served as an assistant coach to both the men's and women's basketball teams at Lindenwood University.\nAs a player or coach, Larry Graham was inducted into halls of fame in Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri."

        "title": "White House tennis court",
        "text": "The tennis court at the White House, the official residence of the president of the United States in Washington, D.C., is located on the South Lawn. Lines have been drawn, and baskets have since been added to the court for use as a basketball court.\nHistory.\nThe first tennis court at the White House was built on the south side of the West Wing during the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, the present location of the West Wing's south terrace. Roosevelt often played here with his son. The court became renowned as the haunt of Roosevelt's 'Tennis cabinet', an informal regular gathering of his closet associates. On 1 March 1909 Roosevelt gave a lunch and speech to say farewell to his 'Tennis cabinet'. United Press described the gathering as a \"famous coterie of afternoon sportsmen that has been the power \"behind the white house\" for over seven years\". Attendees included people as diverse as the French ambassador Jean Jules Jusserand, the Supreme Court Justice William Henry Moody, soldier Luther \"Yellowstone\" Kelly, the Oklahoman wolf hunter John Abernathy and Pudge Heffelfinger, the football player.\nIn 1910, a court was built on the site of the present outdoor swimming pool. Bill Tilden and his protégée Sandy Wiener played on the court in 1923. The son of Calvin Coolidge, Calvin Jr., died of blood poisoning at age 16 after getting a blister as he played without socks on the court in June 1924. The first women's tennis exhibition at the White House was hosted by Florence Harding at the court. The court was relocated south to its present location. During Jimmy Carter's presidency, it was reported that the President personally oversaw the court's playing schedule. The \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that this \"came to be a popular symbol of what many felt was the fatal flaw of his presidency: the unwillingness to delegate authority on small matters\". However, according to his domestic policy advisor Stuart Eizenstat, Carter only asked his staff to sign up in advance to avoid coming to the court when he or First Lady Rosalynn were playing. Bert Lance, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget who was accused of corruption, gave his resignation to Carter during a match on the court. Carter's Chief of Staff, Hamilton Jordan, was a regular player on the court and was often seen wearing his tennis outfit in his office at the White House.\nGeorge H. W. Bush was a regular tennis player. His press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that Bush would \"subconsciously...[judge] people by their competitive attitude on the courts\". Bush would also regularly recount past games with aides, and on-court conversations could prove more effective at getting his attention than sending memos. The court was enlarged by Bush in 1989. He played doubles tennis on the court with American tennis player Pete Sampras in 1990. Bush also played with the president of South Korea, Roh Tae-woo, in 1991.\nA pavilion for the tennis court was built under the administration of Donald Trump in 2020. The ground was broken on the project by Melania Trump, who had helped design the pavilion. The National Park Service stated that it would \"provide a unifying element for the tennis court, the Children's Garden and the Kitchen Garden\" and replace a maintenance building used by groundstaff called \"The Pony Shed\". The tennis pavilion is 1,200 square feet in size and 18 ft high. It has a copper roof and is clad in limestone. The neo-classical style of the White House inspired the design of the pavilion. Private donations funded it.\nNancy Reagan Drug Abuse Fund celebrity exhibitions.\nThe first celebrity tennis exhibition to raise funds for the Nancy Reagan Drug Abuse Fund was held on the court in May 1985. A fundraising target of $450,000 was set (), with nine corporate sponsors contributing $50,000 each. Two hundred guests of the sponsors were seated in temporary bleacher seats. The general public was not invited. Participants included football players Marcus Allen, Rolf Benirschke, Dwight Clark, and Jeff Kemp, swimmer Steve Lundquist, basketball player John Havlicek and the actors Cathy Lee Crosby, Robert Duvall, Veronica Hamel and Dina Merrill. Politicians included John Herrington, Paul Laxalt, Joe Wright, William H. Webster, the Director of the FBI and Swedish ambassador Wilhelm Wachtmeister. The centerpiece of the inaugural tournament was the doubles match viewed by Ronald and Nancy Reagan, which saw John Forsythe and Pam Shriver take on Roscoe Tanner and the Secretary of State George Shultz. The match was umpired by the actors Tom Selleck and Brooke Shields.\nParticipants in the 1986 tournament included tennis player Stan Smith and Ashok and Vijay Amritraj, actors Chuck Norris and Stephanie Zimbalist, and basketball player Julius Erving and football player Herschel Walker. Mr. T was an umpire.\nBasketball court.\nBasketball lines were drawn and baskets added so it could be used as a basketball court during the presidency of Barack Obama in 2009. Obama celebrated his 50th birthday with a game of basketball on the court organized by his friends and his aide Reggie Love. The game featured the NBA and WNBA players Shane Battier, LeBron James, Magic Johnson, Maya Moore, Alonzo Mourning, Joakim Noah, Chris Paul and Derrick Rose in addition to Obama's friends from high school. Kobe Bryant and Bill Russell were spectators."

        "text": "Geoff Thompson (born 1929) is an English former professional snooker player.\nCareer.\nThompson was born in 1929. He started playing cue sports on a scaled-down table aged eight or nine, and on a full-sized billiard table from the age of 13. After serving in the armed forces, Thompson won a local English billiards competition in his home town of Leicester, and was runner-up in the 1952 CIU snooker championship to L.F. Taylor.\nHaving been runner-up CIU final again in 1953, and working as a telephone engineer, Thompson was competing for the first time in the English Amateur Championship when he eliminated the defending champion Tommy Gordon 3–2 and went on to win the title with an 11–9 victory over Cliff Wilson in the final. Due to ill health he withdrew from the 1955 tournament and so was unable to defend the title. In the 1962 championship he compiled a break of 115, a new world record for an officially-recognised amateur break. He was invited to participate in the 1962–63 Television Tournament and, receiving 11 points start in each frame under the handicapping system used, defeated professional Rex Williams 3–0, before losing 2–3 to Ron Gross. In 1966 and 1969 he won the CIU championship.\nHe turned professional in 1970. He played Maurice Parkin in the first qualifying round for the 1972 World Snooker Championship and lost 10–11, and was defeated 5–9 by Graham Miles in the first round of the 1972 World Snooker Championship. His last World Snooker Championship appearance was in 1974, where he was eliminated 3–8 by Bill Werbeniuk.\nIn 1953 he compiled a break of 141, but it was not recognised as a record as the billiard table did not meet the standards required by the Billiards Association and Control Council. At the time, the highest officially recognised break by an amateur was 104."

        "title": "1919 Wimbledon Championships – Women's singles final",
        "text": "The 1919 Wimbledon women's singles final was a championship match at the 1919 Wimbledon Championships, one of the three amateur tennis World Championship tournaments at the time and one of the four modern Grand Slam tournaments. The final was contested as a challenge round between French tennis player Suzanne Lenglen, the winner of the All Comers' bracket, and British tennis player Dorothea Lambert Chambers, the reigning champion from 1914. Lenglen won the match 10–8, 4–6, 9–7 for the title, her first of six Wimbledon singles titles and second major singles title out of 12 in total between her four world championship singles titles and eight Grand Slam singles titles. Lenglen also won the women's doubles title at the tournament with Elizabeth Ryan.\nWith the victory, Lenglen became a global sport celebrity and elevated women's tennis to a similar stature as men's tennis instead of a sideshow. The attendance of 8000 at the match that was more than double the seating capacity led Wimbledon to build a much larger venue that opened three years later. The match set the record for most games in a Wimbledon women's singles final at 44, which stood until 1970. Lenglen and Lambert Chambers had a rematch in the Wimbledon challenge round the following year that Lenglen won easily.\nBackground.\nThe 1919 edition of the Wimbledon Championships was the first since 1914 after a four-year hiatus due to World War I. It was one of two world championship tournaments held that year, along with the World Covered Court Championships. The third such tournament, the World Hard Court Championships, waited until 1920 to resume in part due it being scheduled earlier in the calendar year. At the time, Wimbledon was also known as the World Grass Court Championships to match the naming scheme of the other two world championships on clay (known as Hard Court) and wood (known as Covered Court).\nWith the challenge system in place, Suzanne Lenglen had to win six matches to reach the challenge round, while Dorothea Lambert Chambers did not have to play any other matches. Lenglen made it through the first four rounds while only losing six games. Among the players she defeated were 1912 champion Ethel Larcombe and future champion Kathleen McKane. Her biggest challenge in the All Comers' competition was her doubles partner Ryan, who saved match points down 2–5 to level the second set at five games. After an hour-long rain delay at 30–30, Lenglen won the last two games to win the match. Following a lopsided victory in the All Comers' final against Sattherthwaite, Lenglen faced Lambert Chambers in the challenge round. Lenglen was 20 years old and the reigning World Hard Court champion from 1914, while Lambert Chambers was 40 years old and a seven-time Wimbledon champion. Although Lambert Chambers had defeated Lenglen in their only previous encounter in 1914, Lenglen was considered the favourite for this match five years later.\nMatch details.\nAll three sets of the match were extremely close. Lambert Chambers was able to trouble Lenglen with well-placed drop shots. While Lenglen led most of the first set, Lambert Chambers saved two set points with drop shots while down 3–5 and then earned two set points of her own at 6–5. However, Lenglen saved both and eventually won the set 10–8. Lambert Chambers forced a third set, despite squandering a 4–1 lead. The situation reversed in the final set as Lambert Chambers came from 4–1 down to earn two match points at 6–5. Though like in the first set, Lenglen saved both of them, including the first with a volley off the wooden frame of her racquet on an attempted passing shot by Lambert Chambers. She ultimately won the set 9–7 for her first Wimbledon title. The match set the record for most games in a Wimbledon women's singles final with 44, a mark only since surpassed by the 1970 final between Margaret Court and Billie Jean King. Over 8000 people attended the match, including King George V and Queen Mary, and well above the seating capacity of 3500 on Centre Court.\nAftermath.\nLenglen's victory cemented her place at the top of women's tennis, where she would remain until she retired from competitive tennis in 1926. It also made Lenglen a star and an international celebrity, while boosting the popularity of women's tennis in general. In particular, the sellout crowd of 8000 greatly exceeding the seating capacity of 3500 at Worple Road led Wimbledon to build a new venue at Church Road with a seating capacity of 10000. The new stadium opened three years later in 1922 and Church Road remains the site of Wimbledon today.\nLambert Chambers played in one more Wimbledon, reaching the challenge round again the following year to set up a rematch of the 1919 final. Lenglen won the rematch much more easily, only losing three games. Aside from the 1919 final, Lenglen never lost more than three games in a single set in any of her other major finals at the world championship or Grand Slam tournaments before or thereafter."

        "text": "An equestrian statue of Charles II trampling Cromwell stands near Newby Hall in North Yorkshire, England. It was previously sited at Gautby Hall in Lincolnshire, and was originally installed at the Stocks Market in the City of London. It is a Grade II listed building.\nThe 17th-century statue is made of Carrara marble. It shows a man with the features of King Charles II in armour and riding a horse, which is walking over and trampling a figure lying on the ground representing Oliver Cromwell. The rider holds bronze reins in his left hand and a staff in his right hand. The sculpture stands on a tall plinth of stone ashlars, with moulded base and cornice, and rounded ends.\nThe original sculpture was made in Italy, but the sculptor is not known. It portrayed the Polish commander John III Sobieski riding down a Turkish soldier (said by some sources to commemorate his victory at the Battle of Vienna in 1683, although it pre-dates the battle by at least a decade). A similar sculpture was made by Franciszek Pinck to a design by André-Jean Lebrun and erected in 1788 as part of the in Łazienki Park in Warsaw, which was based on Bernini's equestrian statue of Louis XIV and a sculpture of in Wilanów Palace, also in Warsaw, perhaps inspired by the 1686 portrait of Sobieski by Jerzy Siemiginowski-Eleuter. \nThe sculpture may have been made for the King of Poland or the Polish ambassador in London, but it was bought in by the London goldsmith and banker Sir Robert Vyner, 1st Baronet, who was a strong supporter of Charles II, and who had made Charles's new coronation regalia to replace items sold or destroyed before or under the Commonwealth. Vyner had the head of the rider remodelled by Jasper Latham to resemble Charles. The figure interpreted as \"Cromwell\" retains a distinctly Turkish appearance, including a turban. \nVyner had offered in 1668 to donate a statue of Charles for the Royal Exchange when it was rebuilt after the Great Fire of London, but this offer was rejected. Vyner served as Lord Mayor of London in 1674–75, and he presented the statue to the parish of St Stephen Walbrook and had the statue installed in 1675 in the Stocks Market. This was the location of the last fixed stocks in the City of London, near Cornhill, above the outlet of a conduit fed by a lead pipe from Tyburn.\nIn a satirical poem, Andrew Marvell wondered whether the statue was deliberate revenge for the losses Vyner had suffered with the Stop of the Exchequer,\nWhen each one that passes finds fault with the horse. \nYet all do affirme that the King is much worse\nIn another poem Marvell imagined the horse in discussion with the horse from the equestrian statue of Charles I, re-erected later the same year at Charing Cross, the two horses together comparing their riders and berating the state of the nation.\nThe statue was removed in 1739 to permit the construction of the Mansion House on the site of the Stocks Market, and was given back to Vyner's grandnephew, also Robert Viner. Some years later, the statue was erected at the Vyner family estate at Gautby Hall. Lady Mary Robinson, daughter of Thomas de Grey, 2nd Earl de Grey, married Henry Vyner, and after she had inherited Newby Hall in 1859 the statue was relocated there in 1883, where it remains. It received a Grade II listing in 1967."

        "title": "Cricket Cafe",
        "text": "Cricket Cafe is a restaurant in Portland, Oregon. The cafe's slogan is \"champions of breakfast\", offering the meal throughout the day with additional lunch options. It has received a generally positive reception, especially for its Bloody Marys, vegetarian options, and biscuits and gravy. Previously owned by Dan Bartkowski, the cafe closed unexpectedly in June 2017. Gordon Feighner and Katie Prevost reopened Cricket Cafe months later.\nDescription.\nCricket Cafe is a restaurant on Belmont Street in the retail and residential district of the same name within southeast Portland's Sunnyside neighborhood. The two-level cafe, described by \"Eater Portland\" Mattie John Bamman in 2017 as a \"long-running, highly popular breakfast spot\" with \"huge portions\" and \"good prices\", serves breakfast all day and has a lunch menu as well. In her \"Food Lovers' Guide to Portland, Oregon\" (2014), Laurie Wolf said the cafe delivers \"hearty and satisfying\" meals and \"caters to the throngs of people in Portland who love their breakfast\". The restaurant operates from 8am to 2:30pm every day, as of 2018.\nIn 2002, David Sarasohn of \"The Oregonian\" said the \"resolutely down-home storefront\" serves \"funky\" comfort food. In 2017, \"Willamette Week\" Matthew Korfhage called the restaurant a \"quirky\", \"quaint\", and \"beloved neighborhood brunch spot\". \"Portland Monthly\" describes Cricket as an \"ever-bustling\" and \"comfy, unpretentious hipster pit stop\", with family-friendly, outdoor dining, and takeout services.\nMenu.\nThe menu includes standard breakfast fare such as eggs, hash browns, pancakes, chilaquiles hash, biscuits and gravy, and toasted pound cake with espresso icing. Vegetarian and sausage versions of biscuits and gravy were available, as of 2002; the former had a milk-and-roux gravy made from roasted green and red bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, zucchini, and spices. The Garden Fried Steak has an egg-dipped and fried Gardenburger. The \"trademark lumberjack\" Eggs Benedict comes with pepper jack and sausage gravy. The Veggie Skillet has eggs, potatoes, vegetables, cheese, olives, and sour cream. The lunch menu focused on sandwiches, soups, and salads, and the black bean chili was served with biscuits and a salad.\nThe drink menu known as \"Liquid Breakfast\" has approximately two dozen options separated into \"coolers\" and \"heaters\". Heaters include the Betsy's Demon Hatch (tequila, pomegranate with molasses, and strawberry with lemonade), the Bloody Gary made from jalapeño and vodka and the King of Spain made from espresso, rum, and mocha liquor. Mimosas and several other varieties of Bloody Marys, collectively billed as the \"Bloody Bar\" and ranked by spiciness, are also available. The least spicy of the Bloody Marys is the Bloody Sunrise, described by Aaron Calvin of \"Men's Journal\" as having a \"sweet grenadine inflected flavor and sugar rim\" whilst the most spicy is the Bloody Hot Bonnet, made with habanero infused vodka. In between is the popular Maven, which has cucumber-infused vodka, sake, and a secret maven mix.\nHistory.\nMicah Loiselle served as chef, as of 1999. Cricket Cafe was among several local establishments to host artworks by the Portland-based multi-artist collective Red 76. The group's \"Art/Stall\" exhibit in 2002 featured works by 25 artists displayed in public restrooms. In 2010, Cricket Cafe was one of fourteen businesses seeking an exemption to a city ban on the use of public sidewalks for storing trash. Dan Bartkowski was the cafe's owner, as of 2012. Cricket Cafe was vandalized on Christmas in 2016. The front and back windows and a neon sign were damaged; Bartkowski said nothing was stolen but estimated $10,000–15,000 in damages.\nCricket Cafe closed unexpectedly in June 2017. The surprise closure prompted a local resident to post a sign on the door apologizing for any confusion and confirming that the cafe was \"seemingly closed for the foreseeable future\". In October, restaurateurs Gordon Feighner and Katie Prevost of the popular brunch restaurant Jam on Hawthorne confirmed plans to reopen Cricket Cafe by the end of November. The duo ate there regularly and planned to keep the menu mostly the same, but offer additional vegan and gluten-free options. Feighner also confirmed that interior walls would continue to display artworks curated by the same individual. He told the \"Portland Mercury\": \nThe restaurant began operating initially from 8:00 pm to 3:00 pm daily; the afternoon closing time was decreased by half an hour in January 2018. Cricket Cafe is a member of the Belmont District Business Association, as of 2020.\nReception.\nIn 1999, John Foyston of \"The Oregonian\" complimented the biscuits and gravy and wrote, \"Although the Cricket is relatively new, it feels comfortable and unpretentious and attracts a wide spectrum from its bohemian Belmont neighborhood. There's art on the walls, lots of conversation at the tables and a fine menu.\" In her 2003 book \"Secret Portland, Oregon: The Unique Guidebook to Portland's Hidden Sites, Sounds &amp; Tastes\", Ann Carroll Burgess called Cricket Cafe \"funky, hip, and affordable\" and wrote, \"The strong points that draw in all comers, from yuppie families to boho singles, include cornbread biscuits to die for and a soothing blend of both vegan and meathead dishes.\"\nIn 2007, \"The Oregonian\" Joe Fitzgibbon recommended the cafe for a day out with children because of its \"fast service and friendly prices\". Cricket Cafe was listed in the breakfast category in the \"Portland Mercury\" \"back to school\" guides for students in 2007, 2008, and 2010. In his 2009 book \"Veg Out: Seattle and Portland\", George Stevenson gave the restaurant a 2-star rating and recommended Cricket Cafe for vegetarian options in East Portland. Stevenson called the restaurant \"clean and friendly but funky enough to be interesting\".\nLaurie Wolf called the cafe \"amazing\" and said the pound cake \"will knock your socks off\". She also recommended the \"crazy good\" Bloody Marys and said \"the whole experience is a great way to start the day\". In his 2015 list of the thirteen best Bloody Marys in the U.S., Aaron Calvin of \"Men's Journal\" said \"you can't beat\" the Bloody Bar. In describing the drink menu, \"Portland Monthly\" said the Bloody Gary \"has the potential to incinerate lingering memories of last night's misdeeds\" and the King of Spain \"will stoke the coldest engine\"."

        "text": "The Northern Kentucky Norse men's basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the Northern Kentucky Norse men's basketball program in various categories, including points, assists, blocks, rebounds, and steals. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Norse represent Northern Kentucky University (NKU) in the NCAA Division I Horizon League.\nNorthern Kentucky began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1971. The Norse originally competed in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), later moving to NCAA Division II but maintaining their NAIA membership until aligning completely with the NCAA in the mid-1980s. NKU remained a D-II member until moving to Division I from the 2012–13 season. This history is significant because the official recording of statistics began at different times in different organizations, as well as different NCAA divisions.\nThe NAIA record books do not indicate when the organization began officially recording statistics on a national basis, but its current records (as of 2020–21) for single-game and single-season assists were both set in 1972–73, and the career record for blocks dates to 1975. The NCAA has recorded scoring statistics throughout the \"modern era\" of basketball, which it defines as starting with the 1937–38 season, the first after the center jump after each made field goal was abolished. Individual rebounding was first recorded in 1950–51, as were individual assists. While rebounding has been recorded in every subsequent season, the NCAA stopped recording individual assists after the 1951–52 season. Recording of assists resumed in D-I in 1983–84, but that statistic was not recorded in D-II until 1988–89. Similarly, while the NCAA started recording blocks and steals in D-I in 1988–89, it did not record those statistics in D-II until 1992–93. NKU's record books include players in all named statistics, regardless of whether they were officially recorded by any of the governing bodies in which the school was a member.\nThese lists are updated through the end of the 2019–20 season."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Bearcats represent the University of Cincinnati in the NCAA Division I Big 12 Conference.\nCincinnati began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1901. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Cincinnati's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

The umpires took no action despite Saxena breaking Law 37.1 (\"Obstructing the field\"), and the batter went on to top score with 40 runs in a narrow seven-run win over the Americans.

While the two teams have played each other since Budućnost joined the Yugoslav League in 1980, their rivalry began to develop in the 1990s through the Serbian-Montenegrin League and reached its peak in the Adriatic League during the late 2010s and early 2020s with 3-in-a-row League Finals (2018, 2019, and 2021).\nHistory.\n1980s: Yugoslavia.\nThe first time these two teams actually met was in 1980 when Budućnost qualified for the Yugoslav League for the first time in history. The first derby finished 105–91 in Zvezda's favour. Generally, the rivalry wasn’t prominent in the Yugoslav era since both teams had fluctuations in their results in the 80’s, thus they didn’t have the status as constant contenders for the title.\nFinals summaries.\n2018 ABA League Finals.\nThis was the first ABA League Finals series between Budućnost and Crvena Zvezda, and the first Finals of any competition to occur between Budućnost and Crvena Zvezda since their first meeting in 1980.

As the first half ended, so did the second half. Buducnost took advantage of the relaxation of the Belgraders in the last quarter and mitigated the defeat to a more acceptable 14 points difference.\nThe Zvezda's Mouhammad Faye had 14 points and four rebounds, and Maik Zirbes added 13 points and five rebounds. Joe Ragland recorded 10 points and the game-high 7 assists, while Stratos Perperoglou and Ognjen Dobrić both had 12 points off the bench. Budućnost was led by Filip Barović with 19 points and five rebounds of the bench, and Earl Clark added 11 points. Faye was named the MVP Award.\n2019 ABA League Finals.\nThe 2019 ABA League Finals saw Budućnost and Crvena Zvezda meet for the second straight season. Crvena Zvezda won Games 1 and 2 in Belgrade before the series moved to Podgorica. While Budućnost won Game 3 and 4 at home, the Zvezda took Game 5 at home, earning their fourth championship and their fourth in five seasons.\nGame 2 was a more one-sided affair, with the Zvezda winning 107–69. Game 5 was a blowout victory for the Zvezda, 97–54, led by K. C. Rivers with the game-high 21 points.

        "text": "Andrew Greig (27 October 1889 – 7 January 1959) was a Scotland international rugby union player. He played at the full-back position.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nGreig played for Glasgow HSFP.\nProvincial career.\nThe \"Scottish Referee\" gave this brief biography of Greig on the 28 November 1910, just before the Inter-City match, and predicted international honours:\nIn his school days, Andrew Greig, was looked upon as one whose reputation as a Rugby footballer would be made as a half-back, but when he reached the formers he was induced to accept his place in the last line of defence. His success as a full back is undoubted, and the choice of the Glasgow Committee in selecting him again for that position against Edinburgh will be received with satisfaction. An excellent defender and grand kick, Greig's share of honours may not be confined to Inter-City games.\nGreig played in the Inter-City match on 3 December 1910 for Glasgow District against Edinburgh District.\nInternational career.\nAfter a disappointing showing in the Blues Trial versus Whites Trial match on 21 January 1911 by the backs, it was hoped that Greig - who didn't play in the Trial match - would recover from his injury to take the full back place against Wales. The \"Dundee Evening Telegraph\" expressing this hope:\nThe defence in Saturday's trial match was the poorest ever seen in a game of this importance. The three-quarters and backs both sides were rank bad, and it therefore occasioned no great surprise when it was found that the Union selectors had passed over both backs, and had elected Andrew Greig to play in that position against Wales. It is hoped he will have recovered sufficiently to enable him to take his place, for, from what we saw on Saturday, he will be badly wanted.\nUnfortunately for Greig, the match came too soon. However he later received a cap later in the Five Nations of that season.\nGreig was capped by Scotland for just one match. This was the Five Nations match against Ireland on 25 February 1911. Ireland won the match 16 - 10."

It is different from women's cricket: the latter is sometimes referred to as \"women's hardball cricket\" where a distinction is necessary.\nIn 2017 the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) set up 180 soft ball cricket one-day festivals to introduce women to the game. These festivals continued with, for example, 25 festivals held in Derbyshire and 14 in Cornwall in 2023. there are women's softball leagues in several counties, such as Cornwall, Westmorland, and Yorkshire.\nPlay.\nThe ECB has produced a \"Player Guide\" describing softball cricket, which begins with the statement \"The aim of soft ball cricket is to have fun.\" As described by the ECB softball cricket is played by teams of six to eight players, divided into pairs. The game \"should last no more than an hour\". Each pair will bat for two or three six-ball overs, and all players are encouraged to take a turn at bowling. Overarm bowling is encouraged, but underarm bowling is allowed. Fielders are advised to \"position themselves at a safe distance from the batter when the ball is bowled\". \nScoring.\nThe scoring system gives each team an initial score of 200. Points are gained for runs and boundaries (six if the ball crosses the boundary without touching the ground first, four if it touches the ground), and for wides and no-balls, and five points are lost when a batter is \"out\", which may be by being bowled, caught, run out, stumped, or hitting the wicket. There is no \"leg before wicket\" rule except that a player can be out if they deliberately block the ball with their leg or foot. The winning team is that with the greatest number of points at the end of the game.\nPitch and equipment.\nThe game is played with stumps \"roughly 20 metres apart\", and uses specialised non-wooden bats and a ball softer and lighter than that used in conventional cricket: the official ECB women's softball cricket ball weighs , while the ball used in standard women's cricket weighs between and ."

The Panthers represent University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee in the NCAA's Horizon League.\nMilwaukee began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1896. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Milwaukee's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "Ryan Walters (born January 21, 1986) is an American football coach and former safety, who is the current head football coach for the Purdue Boilermakers. He played college football for Colorado from 2004 to 2008. He then served as the defensive coordinator for the Missouri Tigers (2018–2020) and the Illinois Fighting Illini (2021–2022).\nWalters was born in Los Angeles, California. His father, Marc, was a quarterback for Colorado. He attended Grandview High School in Aurora, Colorado. After graduation from high school, he accepted a football scholarship to the University of Colorado Boulder. After spending his freshman season as a redshirt, he converted from quarterback to safety. He started for three seasons, helping the Buffaloes to two bowl games, earning honorable mention All-Big 12 Conference as a senior.\nAfter going undrafted in the 2009 NFL Draft, Walters turned to coaching, eventually being named the youngest (25 years old) position coach in the Pac-10 Conference during the 2011 season. After various stops along the way, Walters was promoted to defensive coordinator for the Missouri Tigers (2018–2020) and the Illinois Fighting Illini (2021–2022). On December 13, 2022, he was named the 37th head coach in the history of Purdue University.\nEarly life.\nWalters was born in Los Angeles, California to parents Marc and Nicole. Soon after his birth, his father had accepted a scholarship to play quarterback for the Colorado Buffaloes. During his father's playing days, his babysitter was National Football League coach Eric Bieniemy. After his father's playing days, he grew up in Aurora, Colorado, while his father worked as a lawyer for Qwest.\nPlaying career.\nWalters attended Grandview High School, where he played quarterback. As a junior in 2002, he threw for 1,582 yards and 15 touchdowns, while also running for 478 yards and 11 scores before a meniscus tear ended his season. As a senior in 2003, he broke the Grandview record for career touchdown passes, 36, a record that stood until 2020. The spring before his senior season, Walters committed to play college football at Colorado and head coach Gary Barnett. As a senior, he racked up 1,549 passing yards (59.2 completion percentage, 14 TDs), limiting his running as he played hurt a good portion of the season as he played in just nine games.\nFreshman season (2005).\nWalters was able to graduate high school early in December, and enrolled at the University of Colorado in January 2004. He entered his true freshman season as the sixth quarterback on the Buffaloes' depth chart. After an illness kept him out of most of the spring practices, he was asked to move to safety to help the team prepare.

The following week, the Boilermakers traveled to Northwestern, where their offense struggled with backup quarterbacks leading the offense in the absence of Hudson Card, losing 23–15. Purdue would follow its loss to Northwestern up with a win against arch-rival Indiana 35–31 in the Old Oaken Bucket.\nFamily.\nWalters and his wife, Tara, have two sons, Aaron and Cason."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. As of the next NCAA basketball season in 2022–23, the Bulldogs represent Bryant University in the NCAA Division I America East Conference.\nBryant began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1963. The NCAA has recorded scoring statistics throughout the \"modern era\" of basketball, which it defines as starting with the 1937–38 season, the first after the center jump after each made basket was abolished. Rebounding and assists were added in the 1950–51 season. While rebounding has been recorded in each subsequent season, the NCAA stopped recording assists after the 1951–52 season, and did not reinstate assists as an official statistic until 1983–84. Blocks and steals were added in 1985–86. Bryant's record book includes all seasons, whether or not the NCAA officially recorded those statistics in the relevant seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "title": "Super Bowl XLI halftime show",
        "text": "The Super Bowl XLI halftime show took place on February 4, 2007 at Dolphin Stadium in Miami Florida as part of Super Bowl XLI. It was headlined by Prince.\nBackground and development.\nThe executive producer of the show was Don Mischer. Mischer's company, Mischer Productions, was the executive producer and director. White Cherry Entertainment, run by Ricky Kirshner and Glenn Weiss, were also executive producers. The production designer was Bruce Rogers. Mischner Productions and White Cherry Entertainment had earlier signed an agreement to produce marquee events, like the entertainment surrounding the NFL Kickoff Game, throughout the 2006 NFL season. \nFor the first time, Pepsi was the sponsor of the halftime show. They would return to sponsoring halftime shows with Super Bowl XLVII. \nAfter having, in the past, been uninterested in performing in a Super Bowl halftime show, in 2006, Prince expressed interest. Executives that were in charge of booking an act for the halftime show visited Prince in Los Angeles. During this meeting, Prince and three members of his backing band New Power Generation performed for the executives, which convinced the executives that he would be the proper act to perform at the upcoming Super Bowl's halftime show. He was announced as the performer on December 10. \nIn late 2006, representatives of Prince reached out to Julian White, the director of the Florida A&amp;M University, and managed to get the band to agree to performing in the show. The involvement of the marching band was largely kept a secret, with New Power Generation keyboardist Morris Hayes having later shared that he did not know of their inclusion until the first rehearsal that included them. Members of the marching band were not told themselves until roughly a month before the show that they would be performing in the halftime show. \nOne of the ideas Mischer contributed was to have the marching band adorned with illuminated tape, so that would be more visible.\nOne of the centerpiece visual effects utilized involved projecting Prince's silhouette onto a large screen that he stood behind. Air was utilized to make the screen stand erect. This effect was one that Don Mischer had first utilized for the 1996 Summer Olympics opening ceremony.\nMuch of Prince's rehearsals were in the city of Las Vegas, where Prince had a residency show. They used tape to outline the shape of the stage, as they did not have the actual stage available to them for their Las Vegas rehearsals. In the days before the show, Prince and his band rehearsed in a tent adjacent to the stadium. Prince and his supporting performers only had a single rehearsal on the stadium's field.\nDuring his pre-performance joint press conference with national anthem performer Billy Joel, which halftime and national anthem performers conventionally hold, rather than taking questions, Prince gave the press a mini-concert.\nHundreds of volunteers helped to assemble and disassemble the stage. During the stage setup, volunteers accidentally ran over a power cable with a rolling part of the stage. A member of the lighting crew responded to the issue by holding the severed ends of the cable in place with his hands for the entire duration of the show.\nWeather.\nThe weather during the game had been rainy, and this inclement weather continued into Prince's performance, which took place during a downpour. Notably, it began raining during the performance of “Purple Rain.” This was the first occasion in which it rained during a Super Bowl halftime show. There was potential hazard due to the material the stage was made of, as it gets slippery when wet, and, adding to the risk, Prince and his dancers were wearing high-heeled shoes. Further hazard was that electric guitars were used.\nPrince is said to have reveled in the weather, with some involved in the show later reporting that Prince asked if the show-runners could \"make it rain harder\".\nSynopsis.\nThe show was approximately 12 minutes in duration. Prince wore a turquoise suit and had a durag in over hair. He performed on a large stage shaped like his signature \"love symbol\". The edges of the stage had neon lighting. During the show, he was accompanied by his backing band New Power Generation. He was also accompanied by the duo \"The Twinz\", which consisted of identical twins Maya and Nandy McClean, who had previously toured with Prince. Additionally, for some songs, he was further accompanied by the Florida A&amp;M University Marching 100 Band. The marching band had their uniforms adorned with illuminated tape.\nThe performance began with an intro featuring the song \"We Will Rock You\". Fireworks were launched during this intro, and lighting effects simulating lightning were also utilized. Prince then came on stage, rising via a stage elevator, and performed his hit song \"Let's Go Crazy\". During this song, Prince included an ad-libbed call and response from the crowd.\nNow joined by the Florida A&amp;M University Marching 100 Band, he performed a medley of his songs \"Baby I'm a Star\" and \"1999\" and the Creedence Clearwater Revival song \"Proud Mary\".\nHe then performed a medley of Bob Dylan's song \"All Along the Watchtower\" and the Foo Fighters' song \"Best of You\". For these songs, the marching band's instruments were not utilized.\nAs the final song of the performance, he performed his own hit \"Purple Rain\". The marching band again instrumentally accompanied him for the song. During the song's guitar solo, Prince played his guitar positioned behind a screen that had risen from under the stage, having his silhouette projected onto the screen. Because of the inclement weather and the nature of the lighting effects, a portion of the performance appeared to take place during a literal \"purple rain.\" Fireworks were again launched at the end of the song.\nCritical reception.\nThe performance was widely acclaimed. Kelefa Sanneh of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the performance would \"surely go down as one of the most thrilling halftime shows ever; certainly the most unpredictable, and perhaps the best.\" Mark Caro, of the \"Chicago Tribune\", wrote that Prince's performance, \"for once, justified the existence of a mini-concert sandwiched between halves of football.\" Many have opined that the rainy weather actually added to the performance, especially during Prince's rendition of \"Purple Rain\".\nNumerous outlets have retrospectively ranked the performance the best Super Bowl halftime show performance. Further outlets have ranked it among the best.\nCommercial reception.\nPrince's physical album sales increased to 31,000 in the week after his performance, as compared to 14,000 the week before. According to SoundScan, his digital sales increased to 102,000 in the week after his performance, as compared to the 59,000 the week prior. Additionally, his sales on Amazon increased 700%.\nControversy.\nThere was some controversy that, during a portion of the show where Prince was silhouetted onto a screen, the placement of his guitar was phallic. The Smoking Gun reported that in excess of 150 people had complained to the FCC about the Super Bowl broadcast, with the majority of complaints being about either this or a Snickers commercial which featured two men kissing."

Virtus is owned by the coffee entrepreneur Massimo Zanetti.\nHistory.\n2019–2021: Beginnings.\nIn July 2019, the CEO of Virtus Bologna, Luca Baraldi, announced the opening of a women's basketball wing, to participate in the Serie A1 championship. In the same month, Alberto Piombo, a tax advisor, was appointed president of the women's wing. The 2019–20 season started with some troubles for Virtus, however, it was later cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the 2020–21, Virtus signed among others Abby Bishop, Brooque Williams and Ana Marjia Begic, while it confirmed many players of the previous season, like the team captain, Elisabetta Tassinari. Moreover, the new head coach was Lorenzo Serventi. Virtus ended the regular season at the fourth place and was defeated in the national semi-finals by Reyer Venezia.\n2021–present: Zandalasini era.\nOn 20 May 2021, the club signed the 25 years old Cecilia Zandalasini, widely considered among the best Italian players of all time and 2017 WNBA Champion with the Minnesota Lynx. On the same day, president Zanetti announced Lino Lardo as the new head coach. Lardo, who already coached the Black V's men's wing during the early 2010s, is also the coach of Italy's women's national team. The roster was completed within a few days: on 24 May, Virtus signed also Sabrina Cinili, a point guard from Famila Schio, on 27 May Ivana Dojkić, a Croatian shooting guard from UKS Praha on 29 May Myisha Hines-Allen, a small forward from Lattes Montpellier who became WNBA Champion in 2019, and on 30 May Brianna Turner, a power forward from Adelaide Lightning.\nDespite good premises, in November 2021 the team was eliminated in the group stage of the EuroCup. On 19 April 2022, during the national semi-finals against Reyer Venezia, Lino Lardo was fired and his assistant Angela Gianolla became the new head coach. The team ousted Reyer Venezia by 2–1 in the national semi-finals, reaching the finals for the first time in its history and qualifying for the EuroLeague Women. However, Virtus was defeated 3–1 by Famila Schio.\nIn the following season, Giampiero Ticchi became the new head coach and the club signed important international players like Iliana Rupert, Cheyenne Parker and Kitija Laksa. In 2022–23, Virtus played for the first time in the EuroLeague Women, but it was ousted in the regular season with a winning record of 5–9. The club ended the Italian championship's season at the first place but, once again, it lost the national finals against Famila Schio by 2–0. During the first game of the series in PalaDozza, Virtus set a new all-time record for LBF with 5,337 attendances.\nPlayers.\nCurrent roster.\n&lt;section begin=roster/&gt;\n&lt;section end=roster/&gt;"

        "text": "The Grand Canyon Anelopes men's basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the Grand Canyon Antelopes men's basketball program in various categories, including points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Antelopes represent Grand Canyon University (GCU) in the NCAA Division I Western Athletic Conference.\nGCU began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1949, the year of its founding, as a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). GCU did not join the NCAA until 1991, playing in Division II until moving to Division I in 2013. This history is significant because the official recording of statistics began at different times in different organizations, as well as different NCAA divisions. The NAIA record books do not indicate when the organization began officially recording statistics on a national basis, but its current records (as of 2020–21) for single-game and single-season assists were both set in 1972–73, and the career record for blocks dates to 1975. The NCAA has recorded scoring statistics throughout the \"modern era\" of basketball, which it defines as starting with the 1937–38 season, the first after the center jump after each made field goal was abolished. Individual rebounding was first recorded in 1950–51, as were individual assists. While rebounding has been recorded in every subsequent season, the NCAA stopped recording individual assists after the 1951–52 season. Assists were not reinstated as an official statistic in Division I until the 1983–84 season. By the time GCU joined the NCAA, assists were officially being recorded in Division II, with that practice having started in 1988–89. However, blocks and steals were not recorded in D-II until 1992–93, four seasons after they were first recorded in D-I.\nGrand Canyon's record book includes players in all named statistics, regardless of whether they were officially recorded by any of the governing bodies in which the school was a member. That said, the record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

The championship featured a mix of professional and amateur drivers, competing in Formula 3 cars that conform to the FIA Formula 3 regulations for the championship. This was the third season of the championship and the first after a merger with Formula Renault Eurocup which resulted to the change of the engine supplier to Alpine.\nThe season commenced on 17 April at Imola Circuit and concluded on 31 October at Autodromo Nazionale di Monza, after ten rounds.\nSwiss driver Grégoire Saucy, driving for ART Grand Prix, took the drivers' title in Round 9 at Mugello.\nTeams and drivers.\nThirteen teams had been pre-selected to the 2021 championship. Teams had a maximum of three cars, but were allowed to run a fourth car if they enter with a female driver. G4 Racing took over Bhaitech's entry and M2 Competition withdrew as only twelve teams are allowed to compete in the series.\nRace calendar.\nThe initial calendar was revealed on 7 December 2020. The series adopted the Formula Renault Eurocup weekend format with qualifying session 1 and race 1 on Saturday and qualifying session 2 and race 2 on Sunday. After rescheduling the season opener at Spa to support the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, the second Imola round was subsequently dropped and plans to reinclude Spa were announced. A planned round at the Nürburgring was cancelled because of the flood disaster in the region, with a replacement at Circuit Ricardo Tormo added later.\nChampionship standings.\nPoints were awarded to the top 10 classified finishers.\nTeams' standings.\nFor teams entering more than two cars only the two best-finishing cars were eligible to score points in the teams' championship."

        "text": "The Bangladesh women's national cricket team represents Bangladesh in international women's cricket. A full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC), the team is governed by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB).\nOn 24 November 2011, Bangladesh was granted one-day status after defeating USA by nine wickets in the 2011 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier at Dhaka. That win guaranteed that Bangladesh would finish in the top six in the tournament and thus be ranked in the top ten globally, which was the requirement for attaining one-day status.\nBangladesh played their first Women's One Day International cricket (WODI) match in that same tournament against Ireland on 26 November 2011; Bangladesh won the match by 82 runs to secure their first win in this format. It was also the first international match for Bangladesh's women's team. Bangladesh had to wait until 2016 to get their first overseas win in this format when they beat Ireland by ten runs in the third and final ODI. As the first two matches of the series got washed out, that win in the last ODI marked the first overseas bilateral series win for Bangladesh in this format. However Bangladesh's first bilateral series win came against Pakistan in 2014 when they made a clean sweep over Pakistan in a two match series.\n, Bangladesh have played 38 WODI matches, winning 9 and losing 27 (2 matches had no result).\nThe Bangladesh women's national cricket team first competed in Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) cricket on 28 August 2012 when they played Ireland in the first match of a Twenty20 tri-nation series in Dublin. They recorded their first victory in that match beating the Irish side by 4 wickets.\nThe Bangladeshi side would have debuted in the Twenty20 international arena the previous day as they were scheduled to play Pakistan at the same venue, but that one-off match was abandoned without a ball being bowled. Bangladesh won their first Twenty20 at home against South Africa in the first match of a three match Twenty20 international series in 2012, winning the rain-shortened match by seven wickets. Bangladesh secured their first bilateral T20I series win against Ireland in June 2018, taking the three match series 2–1. The same month the Bangladeshi side won their first multi-team international tournament with victory in the 2018 Asia Cup, denying India a straight seventh title; it was the first time that a Bangladeshi cricket team had won a multi-team international tournament in any version of the game.\n, they have played 75 WT20I matches and won 27 of them; 48 were lost.\n, Bangladesh, alongside Afghanistan and Zimbabwe, is one of the three full members of ICC that is yet to feature in a women's Test cricket.\nBangladesh have faced five teams in Women's ODI cricket, with their most frequent opponent being South Africa, against whom they have played 17 matches. Bangladesh have registered more wins against Pakistan than against any other team, with four. In Women's T20I matches, Bangladesh have played against 18 teams. They have played against Pakistan most frequently in ODI matches. Bangladesh have defeated Ireland in 6 matches, which is their best record in T20Is. Bangladesh have a 100% winning record against four opponents (Scotland, Thailand, Netherlands and Papua New Guinea) that they have encountered in more than one match.\n, like their male counterparts, the Bangladeshi women's side has not been involved in any tied international matches."

        "title": "2021 Arkansas Razorbacks baseball team",
        "text": "The 2021 Arkansas Razorbacks baseball team (variously the Diamond Hogs or the Omahogs) represents the University of Arkansas in the 2021 NCAA Division I baseball season. The Razorbacks are coached by Dave Van Horn, in his 19th season with the Razorbacks, and play their home games at Baum–Walker Stadium.\nPreseason.\nPreseason coaches poll.\nIn the preseason coaches poll, Arkansas was predicted to finish in third place in the West Division. Ole Miss received a majority of the votes to win the West Division, with Mississippi State, Arkansas, and LSU all receiving at least one such vote. Florida was the overwhelming favorite to win the East Division, receiving all but one first-place vote, with the last going to Vanderbilt. The Gators were also the favorites to win the SEC as a whole; they received 12 such votes, while Mississippi State and Vanderbilt received one each.\nPreseason team selections.\nMultiple Razorbacks were named to preseason All-America teams by several organizations and publications. \"Baseball America\" named outfielder Christian Franklin and second baseman Robert Moore to its All-America second team, and College Baseball Nation made the same picks, though listed Moore as a shortstop. D1Baseball, Perfect Game, and NCBWA all named Franklin to their first teams. In addition, four Razorbacks – Moore, Franklin, catcher Casey Opitz, and designated hitter Matt Goodheart – were named to the SEC Baseball Coaches preseason All-Conference first team. Both Franklin and Moore were also named to the Golden Spikes Award preseason watchlist by USA Baseball.\nSchedule and results.\nArkansas' schedule was released on January 19, 2021. The Razorbacks began their season in Arlington, Texas, with the State Farm College Baseball Showdown. There, they looked to improve on their results from last year, where Arkansas travelled to Houston to play Oklahoma, Texas, and Baylor, losing all three. After wins against Texas Tech, Texas, and TCU, the Hogs opened their home season with a pair of weekend series sweeps against Southeast Missouri State and Murray State before playing their first true road series at Louisiana Tech. The final game against Louisiana Tech was the team's first loss of the season. They would suffer two more in quick succession, however, dropping a midweek home game to Oklahoma and the first of a home weekend series to Alabama, though they would recover to win the last two and take their SEC-opening series. Several days later, Arkansas finished a six-game home stand with a pair of midweek victories over Memphis.\nRegular season.\nFebruary.\nState Farm College Baseball Showdown.\nThe Razorbacks faced a tough weekend to begin their 2021 campaign, as they travelled to Arlington, Texas to compete in the 2021 State Farm College Baseball Showdown. Ranked No. 8 in the preseason D1Baseball, Coaches, and NCBWA polls, No. 14 by \"Baseball America\", and No. 22 by \"Collegiate Baseball Newspaper\", Arkansas started their season with three games in three days, against three top-10 opponents from the state of Texas. The first of these was Texas Tech, ranked No. 3 in the country. This was the 62nd meeting between the two teams; Arkansas entered leading the all-time series, 46–15. Zebulon Vermillion and Patrick Monteverde started on the mound for the Razorbacks and Red Raiders, respectively, and both pitchers carried their teams through four scoreless innings to begin the game. Both teams scored first in their respective halves of the fifth inning; Arkansas took a 1–0 lead on a bases-loaded walk in the top half of the inning, but Texas Tech responded with five runs of their own by way of three singles and a wild pitch in the bottom half to take a 5–1 lead. Arkansas tied the game in the sixth after Jalen Battles' 2 RBI double, a wild pitch, and a Robert Moore sac fly, though Tech pulled one back to enter the seventh inning up by a single run. Both teams put more runs on the board in the seventh: a balk and a wild pitch sent three runs in for the Razorbacks, and a three-run Braxton Fulford home run did the same for the Red Raiders. Neither team scored in the eighth inning, and Arkansas entered the final frame trailing by one. This deficit did not last long; the Razorbacks plated five runs in the ninth, as a Battles single, Moore walk, a wild pitch, and a 2 RBI single by Braydon Webb made the score 13–9 heading into the bottom of the ninth. As he had done in the previous two frames, Arkansas closer Elijah Trest retired the side, this time with two popups and a strikeout, to end the contest. Trest was awarded a win, while Tech reliever Andrew Devine, who allowed four runs on five hits, was awarded the loss. Caden Monke and Kole Ramage also made appearances on the mound for Arkansas, though they did not record an out, and Kevin Kopps and Ryan Costeiu recorded three each. Vermillion, the starter, was credited with four innings pitched, as he was pulled after facing two batters in the fifth inning, and Trest pitched three full innings after entering in relief of Costeiu in the seventh with nobody out.\nThe Hogs' second game of the tournament matched them with the No. 9 Texas Longhorns. This game was the 89th between the two teams; Texas entered leading the series, 56–32. The Razorbacks started Peyton Pallette on the mound, while Tristan Stevens got the starting nod for the Longhorns. Like Arkansas' first game, this game got off to a slow start, with neither team scoring in the first three innings; both teams were retired in order with the exception of Texas' half of the third inning, where they left three runners on base and recorded the game's first hit but could not score. Texas went down in order in the top of the fourth, and a single by Cullen Smith in the bottom of that inning put the Razorbacks' first hit on the board. Two batters later, Brady Slavens recorded an RBI and Arkansas' first run with a single that sent Smith home. Caden Monke entered in relief of Pallette in the top of the fifth, and Monke himself was pulled in favor of Caleb Bolden at the beginning of the sixth inning. In the bottom of the sixth, following a Robert Moore groundout, the Hogs got two runners on base by way of a six-pitch walk to Christian Franklin and Cullen Smith being hit with a pitch, prompting Texas to pull Stevens in favor of Dawson Merryman. After striking out the first batter he faced, Merryman gave up a three-run home run to Brady Slavens, which increased Arkansas' lead to four. From that point, Texas managed only two baserunners in the last three innings of the game, while Arkansas had six, though no more runs would come across and the score remained 4–0. Caleb Bolden, credited with 4 innings pitched with no hits given up, was awarded the save; Caden Monke got the win and Texas starter Tristan Stevens was handed the loss. While starter Peyton Pallette did not get a decision, he finished with a career-best eight strikeouts, with the Hogs pitching staff combining for fifteen in what was the first shutout of Texas since 1988.\nFor their final game in Arlington, the Razorbacks faced the No. 10 TCU Horned Frogs for the 67th time in program history; Arkansas entered leading the series, 47–19. Lael Lockhart, a graduate transfer from Houston, made his debut as the Hogs' starter, while Austin Krob started on the mound for TCU. With the exception of the four-pitch walk dealt to TCU's Tommy Sacco, neither offense managed a baserunner in the first inning, and the Hogs recorded a hit but could not score in the top of the second. The Horned Frogs opened the scoring in the bottom half of that inning, as a pair of singles by Brayden Taylor and Luke Boyers allowed Zach Humphreys, who had been hit by a pitch earlier in the inning, to score. After that, neither team managed anything for several innings, and both teams pulled their starters in the fifth inning; Charles King relieved Krob and Evan Taylor relieved Lockhart. With the score still 1–0 in favor of TCU, Jaxon Wiggins made his Razorback debut when he entered the game for Taylor to begin the bottom of the sixth; he retired his first three batters consecutively on strikeouts. The Razorbacks again made a pitching change to begin the seventh inning, sending Ryan Costeiu out, who, like Wiggins, retired the first three batters he faced. After six scoreless innings, Arkansas found the scoreboard in the seventh, as a Christian Franklin triple drove home Jalen Battles to tie the game. Immediately afterwards, King was pulled and Haylen Green was sent to the mound for TCU, though Cullen Smith singled shortly thereafter to drive home the go-ahead run for the Razorbacks. Closer Kevin Kopps entered the game for the bottom of the eighth, setting down the side in order, and a Casey Opitz double and a Harrison Beethe wild pitch allowed the Hogs to plate two more runs in the top of the ninth and take a 4–1 lead into the final half-inning of the game. Despite two walks, Kopps was able to strike out three batters and end the game, earning the Razorbacks a 3–0 start to the season and a sweep in Arlington. Costeiu was awarded the win and Kopps was credited with a save, while Charles King received the loss. Over the course of the weekend, the Razorbacks were not averse to late-game offense; 19 of their 21 runs in the three games combined came in the sixth inning or later. \nSoutheast Missouri State weekend series.\nThe Razorbacks opened their 2021 home season at Baum–Walker Stadium in Fayetteville with a four-game weekend series against the Southeast Missouri State Redhawks, who entered with a 2–1 record. These four games would be the 12th–15th in the all-time series, with the Hogs leading 6–5 in previous meetings. The starting pitchers for each team were Dylan Dodd and Caleb Bolden for the Redhawks and Razorbacks, respectively. The game started well for the visitors, as SEMO loaded the bases after the first three batters, and sent home a run after a single by Lincoln Andrews. That prompted a pitching change for the Razorbacks after just four batters, as Patrick Wicklander entered. Inheriting loaded bases, Wicklander forced a fielder's choice that scored the Redhawks' second run, and a steal of home put SEMO up by three after the top of the first. The Hogs, for their part, got two baserunners in their half of the first, but a groundout ended the inning before either could advance past second base. Arkansas scored a run of their own in the bottom of the third when Christian Franklin hit a solo home run to left field, narrowing the deficit to two. Another solo home run in the fourth inning, this time by Brady Slavens, cut the Redhawks' lead to one. Wicklander, having completed 4.1 innings, was pulled in the top of the fifth, with Caden Monke entering and retiring the final two batters of the fifth. Arkansas would leave four runners on base in the fifth and sixth innings combined, and Austin Williams entered to pitch in relief of SEMO starter Dylan Dodd to begin the seventh inning. He would retire three straight Razorback batters, all on groundouts, before the Redhawks scored twice more in the top of the eighth by way of a Danny Wright 2 RBI single. Afterwards, Ryan Costeiu relieved Monke for the Razorbacks and finished the inning; Costeiu himself was replaced by Evan Gray for the ninth inning. Trailing 2–5, Arkansas needed three runs in the final half-inning to avoid a loss in their home opener; a pair of singles set up an RBI for Jalen Battles that brought the game within two. After a pitching change that sent Kyle Miller to the mound, a bases-loaded walk to Franklin and a sac fly from Cullen Smith, tied the game at five. A strikeout followed, sending the game to extras. Closer Jaxon Wiggins was sent to the bump for the Hogs to begin the tenth inning; he retired the first three SEMO batters in order, giving Arkansas an opportunity to win the game in the bottom of the tenth. A double and a walk by Casey Opitz and Cayden Wallace, respectively, prompted a pitching change that brought Blake Cisneros into the game, though he hit his first batter to load the bases. The next batter up, Battles, hit a walk-off single, driving home Opitz to win the game 6–5. Wiggins received the win for the Hogs, while Miller, who allowed the go-ahead run to reach base in the tenth, was handed the loss. With the win, the Razorbacks have now won 27 consecutive home openers in a row, dating back to 1995.\nLooking to improve on the previous day's performance, Arkansas started Zebulon Vermillion on the mound, while Southeast Missouri State's Noah Niznik got the start. Like the first game, Southeast Missouri got runners on base early, as the Redhawks left three men on in the first two innings without scoring. On the contrary, the Razorbacks were retired in order in both of the first two innings. Both teams found the scoreboard in their respective halves of the third inning, as SEMO scored two by way of a walk and a pair of singles, while the Razorbacks put up two of their own via a Robert Moore two-run homer. Evan Taylor entered the game to pitch for Arkansas to begin the fourth; he lasted only three batters after two walks and a wild pitch, and was relieved by Connor Noland, who retired the side with a double play. Arkansas went down in order in the bottom of the fourth, as did the Redhawks in the top of the fifth, and, despite Brayden Webb being hit by a pitch and stealing second base shortly thereafter, the Razorbacks were held scoreless in the bottom half of that inning as well. The Hogs got the bats going in the bottom of the sixth inning, as Robert Moore reached on a bunt single and scored after a two-run home run by Cayden Wallace; Arkansas' lead would soon increase to four after a Brady Slavens triple and a Charlie Welch home run, after which SEMO starter Noah Niznik would be pulled in favor of Hunter Ralls. SEMO cut the deficit back to three in the top of the seventh, as Peyton Leeper scored on a Tyler Wilber single. This was undone in the bottom of the eighth, as Christian Franklin homered on just the fourth pitch of the inning, and later that inning the Redhawks would send Joseph Karall to the mound following a single and a hit by pitch. Entering the ninth inning, Arkansas made several positional changes, including the substitution of Kevin Kopps as the new pitcher. Despite allowing a single, Kopps got three outs to end the game and secure Arkansas at least a share of the four-game series with a 7–3 victory. Connor Noland was awarded the win for the Razorbacks, while Niznik was handed the loss. The win gave Arkansas their third straight 5–0 start to a season.\nIn their third game, the Razorbacks looked to clinch the series, and gave the starting nod to right-hander Peyton Pallette, while Ryan Vogt got the start for Southeast Missouri State. The Arkansas bats got started significantly earlier than in any of the Hogs' previous games this year; the bottom of the first began with a leadoff four-pitch walk, two stolen bases, and a wild pitch that prompted a first inning pitching change, which brought Bryce Grossius to the mound. Grossius, after forcing the second out of the inning on an RBI groundout, issued two additional walks, a single, and a wild pitch, before striking out Matt Gregory to end the inning with a 4–0 score. A 1-2-3 second inning for the Redhawks allowed the Hogs offense to take the field once again, where a leadoff single from Robert Moore was immediately followed by a first-pitch two-run homer by Christian Franklin, his third of the series, bumping the Razorbacks' lead to six. The bottom of the third brought more scoring for Arkansas; following a pitching change that brought Matt Perego to the mound, a Moore RBI single and a wild pitch later in the inning widened the margin to eight. SEMO was retired in order in the fourth, and a Jalen Battles double which scored Cullen Smith put the score at 9–0 heading into the fifth inning. Despite tallying their third hit, SEMO was unable to score, and they brought in their fourth pitcher of the game, Joey Kossine, to start the bottom of the fifth, the first scoreless frame for the Arkansas offense. After tossing five complete innings, Pallette was relieved by Nate Wohlgemuth to begin the top of the sixth, though after two walks, a single, a wild pitch, and a run allowed, he was pulled in favor of Zack Morris, who finished the inning. For the first time in the game, Arkansas was retired in order in the bottom of the sixth, as were the Redhawks in the top of the seventh, with Kole Ramage starting that inning on the mound. Two hits in the seventh for Arkansas proved fruitless, and SEMO managed to cut the deficit to seven with an eighth inning solo home run, off the bat of Andrew Keck. This prompted the Hogs' fourth pitching change of the afternoon, as Matthew Magre was tapped to make his collegiate debut, and, after walking his first batter on four pitches, achieved the final two outs to end the frame. SEMO, for their part, put their fourth pitcher of the night on the mound as well, as Joseph Karall started the eighth, and did not allow a run despite giving up the Hogs' final two hits of the night. In the final inning, Gabriel Starks, also making his first collegiate appearance, came to the mound for Arkansas, and retired the side to end the game, 9–3, and clinch the series for the Razorbacks. Both starters earned their respective decisions; Pallette with the win and Vogt with the loss.\nLooking to complete the season-opening series sweep, Arkansas and Southeast Missouri State met for a fourth and final time on Sunday afternoon in Fayetteville. With left-hander Lael Lockhart starting on the mound for Arkansas and right-hander Austin Williams starting on the mound for the Redhawks, the game got underway with three straight outs by both teams. SEMO achieved the game's first hit in the top of the second by way of a Lincoln Andrews single, though a 5-4-3 double play ended the inning one batter later. Arkansas established their offense early yet again, as Cayden Wallace and Brady Slavens hit solo home runs to lead off the bottom of the second and establish a 2–0 lead for the Razorbacks. A Casey Opitz double and a Jalen Battles RBI single several batters later increased the lead to three, and was the end of the afternoon for Williams as Connery O'Donnell came in to relieve him after 1.2 innings. The Redhawks found the scoreboard late in their ensuing inning, as Peyton Leeper's groundout scored Jevon Mason to make it 3–1. In the bottom of the third, Arkansas got runs across on consecutive batters as Cullen Smith's double scored Slavens and an error by O'Donnell allowed Smith to advance to third and score himself, making the score 5–1. SEMO kept up the offense in their half of the fourth inning, as Andrew Keck and Mason got onboard and were driven home by a single from Ty Stauss, which prompted Arkansas's first pitching change of the afternoon, a switch to Caden Monke. Monke's day did not last long though, as he walked his first two batters on 12 pitches combined and was then pulled himself in favor of Kevin Kopps. SEMO replaced their pitcher to start the fourth as well; Hunter Ralls entered and allowed the first five batters of the inning to reach base: Robert Moore on a double, Christian Franklin on an error that scored Moore, Matt Goodheart on a two-run home run, and Wallace and Slavens on doubles. Later in the inning, Arkansas increased the lead further; Bates and Battles plated runs on consecutive RBI base hits, making the score 11–3 in the Razorbacks' favor. A leadoff home run from Austin Blazevic in the top of the fifth inning narrowed the margin to seven, but three consecutive outs to follow kept the score at 11–4. A rain delay in the middle of the fifth led to the game being called then (as the game was official after the conclusion of the top of the fifth), and Arkansas completed the sweep of Southeast Missouri State with Kopps earning the win and Williams receiving the loss.\nMarch.\nMurray State weekend series.\nTo begin the month of March, the newly-ranked No. 1 Razorbacks played host to the Murray State Racers in a three-game weekend series. Having met twice before, in a two-game series in 1986, the first game of the series began on the evening of March 5, 2021. Left-hander Shane Burns got the starting nod for the visiting Racers, while right-hander Peyton Pallette started the series for the Razorbacks. Murray State started the game with a 1-2-3 inning on offense, and the Hogs were the first to record a hit with Robert Moore's leadoff single in the bottom of the first. The Hogs got a second baserunner after Christian Franklin was delivered a four-pitch walk, but both of those runners were left stranded when the inning ended. The Racers were the first on the scoreboard, as a double by Ryan Perkins sent Tanner Booth home and established a 1–0 lead for the visitors in the top of the third. The Razorbacks responded in their half of the inning, with two leadoff walks and a Cayden Wallace sacrifice fly tying the contest at 1. Arkansas took the lead two batters later, as Casey Opitz's triple drove home two runs and gave Arkansas a 3–1 lead. An RBI single by Jake Slunder in the top of the fourth inning brought the deficit to one run, and the Racers continued their scoring in the top of the fifth. With Connor Noland entering to pitch for Arkansas, a one-out single followed by a two-run homer from Brock Anderson gave the Racers the lead, and Noland was pulled himself in favor of Zack Morris. Morris's first batter was Trey Woosley, who homered on the seventh pitch of the at bat and extended the Racer lead to three runs. Both offenses were relatively quiet from then until the bottom of the sixth inning, when Robert Moore's home run scored himself and Jalen Battles and made it a one-run game again. The Hogs threatened again in the bottom of the seventh, but stranded runners on second and third and were unable to capitalize. Ryan Costeiu entered the game to pitch the eighth inning for Arkansas, and walked two batters before being replaced in favor of Kevin Kopps. A wild pitch and a walk loaded the bases for the Racers, though a strikeout ended the inning and ensured the Racers' lead remained at one. Arkansas took the lead shortly thereafter, as Zack Gregory walked and Robert Moore hit his second home run of the game, putting Arkansas ahead 7–6. Jaxon Wiggins entered the game to pitch the ninth inning for Arkansas, and finished the game with a 1-2-3 inning, earning his first save of the year in the process. Kopps was awarded the win, and Alec Whaley got the loss for Murray State.\n2021 MLB draft.\nTrest did not sign with the Rockies and returned to Arkansas.\nAwards.\nPostseason awards.\nUpon the conclusion of the conference season, the SEC handed out its postseason awards and named its all-conference teams for 2021. Right-handed pitcher Kevin Kopps was named the SEC Pitcher of the Year, the second Arkansas player to earn that honor, and head coach Dave Van Horn was named the SEC Coach of the Year for the second time. Kopps, alongside second baseman Robert Moore and designated hitter Matt Goodheart were named first team all-SEC players, with center fielder Christian Franklin and pitcher Patrick Wicklander making the all-SEC second team. Infielder Cayden Wallace was one of thirteen SEC players named to the all-conference freshman team, and a further two Razorbacks - Robert Moore and pitcher Peyton Pallette - made the newcomer all-SEC team. Three Razorbacks were named to the all-SEC defensive team: Christian Franklin, Robert Moore, and Kevin Kopps. On June 3, 2021, Kopps was named the National Player of the Year by the Collegiate Baseball Newspaper. He is the first reliever to ever be awarded that honor. On June 18, 2021, Kopps won the 34th annual Dick Howser Trophy, bestowed annually to the national college baseball player of the year. Kopps is the second player in Arkansas baseball history to win the Howser Trophy, along with Andrew Benintendi in 2015. The Howser Trophy is considered to be the Heisman Trophy of college baseball. On June 28, 2021, Kopps was named the D1Baseball.com National Player of the Year. On July 15, 2021, Kopps was named the winner of the 43rd annual Golden Spikes Award, given annually to the best amateur baseball player in the United States. He is the second Arkansas player to win this award after Benintendi in 2015."

        "text": "World Table Tennis, stylized as WTT, is an organization created by the ITTF in 2019 that runs commercialized table tennis tournaments. Its inaugural tournament was held in November 2020 in Macao, China. It is distinguished from the predecessor ITTF World Tour by various rules changes and big prize money for commercialized purposes. The head of its council is Liu Guoliang, a former Olympic gold medalist and former head coach of China.\nBackground.\nIn 1926, The ITTF was founded by William Henry Lawes of Wymondham, the nine founding members being Austria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, England, Germany, Hungary, India, Sweden and Wales. The first international tournament was held in January 1926 in Berlin while the first World Table Tennis Championships was held in December 1926 in London. It was the only event for over 50 years that was run and managed commercially by the ITTF.\nIn 1980, the ITTF World Cups was introduced followed by the ITTF World Tour in 1996. Up till 2003, commercial rights for these events were passed on to the local organising committees (LOC) but a different approach was taken to centralise rights through the creation of TMS. TMS was tasked to manage these rights on behalf of ITTF up till 2017 when ITTF decided to buy back the rights to be taken in house.\nIn 2018, professional consultants Deloitte and Withers were engaged to assist with remodelling the way that the ITTF does business. Through full models and financial understanding of our events and other worldwide properties, ITTF sought to understand the untapped commercial potential of Table Tennis. One key finding led to the idea of separation between the management of the professional and institutional structures of table tennis.\nOn 30 May 2019, ITTF announced the idea of World Table Tennis (WTT). WTT was to become the brand new commercial vehicle to drive success in the revolution and professionalisation of table tennis. To manage the set up of WTT, the ITTF executive committee appointed a selection panel. The appointed selection panel included ITTF President Thomas Weikert, ITTF Deputy President Khalil Al-Mohannadi, ITTF Executive Vice President for Finance Petra Sorling, ITTF CEO Steve Dainton, and ITTF Marketing Director Matthew Pound.\nWTT also announced the hire of Philippe Le Floc’h, former Chief Commercial Officer at FIFA and marketing director at UEFA, as Senior Commercial Strategy Consultant, in line with WTT's aim to commercialise the sport. Shortly after, Stephen Duckitt, who has 15 years of sports management experience, primarily with WTA and ATP, was announced as WTT Event Strategy Director.\nOn 29 June 2020, WTT announced that China Table Tennis Association President, Liu Guoliang accepted the role as Chair of the WTT Council. The WTT Council is tasked to ensure the healthy development of WTT and be at the helm of the future development of table tennis. WTT Macao was announced on 11 September 2020 to be held between 25 and 29 November 2020. The debut event was a promotional showcase featuring 16 of the world's best male and 16 of the world's best female paddlers. The event implemented a brand new format with innovative scoring methods. It also featured a prize purse of US$800,000 with players paid a minimum of US$15,000, earning more prize money per match they win.\nNext to join was Melissa Soobratty. Announced on 4 December 2020, the former vice president, Media at Football Marketing Asia joined as WTT Senior Media Director to oversee all areas related to content, to further professionalise the organisation's expanding media operations.\nWTT event structure.\nGrand Smash.\nThe Grand Smashes will become the pillars of the sport and the most important events in the table tennis calendar. The events will feature both Men's and Women's singles draws with more players now receiving automatic entry into events. There will be fewer seeded players and a separate qualifying draw to ensure that the excitement kicks off right from the start. Doubles and Mixed Doubles events will also be played during the Grand Smashes.\nDates: Fixed dates on the annual WTT Calendar\nPlayers: 64 Men's &amp; Women's Singles, Doubles &amp; Mixed doubles draw\nLength of event: 10 Days + Qualification\nPrize Pool: Up to US$ 3 million\nNumber of events: Up to 4\nWTT Series.\nThe WTT Series will serve as the platform for all professional players to compete internationally. The series is split up into 3 tiers to give the athletes adequate playing opportunities: Cup Finals, Champion Series and the Contender Series. WTT aims to hold these events in unique venues around the world that include theatres, bars, clubs, stadiums and more to create a unique, interesting and intimate opportunity for fans to interact with the athletes.\nWTT Finals.\nThe WTT Finals are split into Men's and Women's events that will be held separately. The top 16 players of the year will qualify for this year-end event together with the best 8 pairs. Qualification will be determined by the player's performance throughout the WTT season and reflected through their Table Tennis World Ranking.\nThe first two editions of WTT Finals (2021 and 2022) was known as WTT Cup Finals. WTT stated that the winners of the WTT Cup Finals would win the prestigious ITTF World Cup trophies in March 2021, but the winners have been actually presented with WTT Finals specific trophies since the inaugural editon.\nPlayers: 16 in Men's &amp; Women's Singles, Top 8 pair in doubles\nLength of event: 5 days\nPrize Pool: Up to US$1.5million each\nNumber of events: 2\nWTT Champions.\nThe WTT Champion Series is exclusive to the top 32 men and women in the world. Four separate men's and women's event will be held with up to US$5million up for grabs. The matches will be played on one table to ensure that the best TV production and best entertainment is presented to fans.\nPlayers: 32 Men's &amp; Women's Singles\nLength of event: 6 days\nPrize Pool: Up to US$5million\nNumber of events: 4 men &amp; 4 women\nWTT Star Contenders.\nWTT Star Contenders will consist of 6 events throughout the year featuring 48 men and 48 women.

        "title": "Super Bowl XXXI halftime show",
        "text": "The Super Bowl XXXI halftime show took place on January 26, 1997 at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. The show was titled \"Blues Brothers Bash\" and featured actors Dan Aykroyd, John Goodman, and Jim Belushi as The Blues Brothers. The show highlighted blues music and also had performances by the rock band ZZ Top and singer James Brown.\nBackground and development.\nThe show's producers were Select Productions, Radio City, and House of Blues.\nThe show's sponsor was Oscar Mayer.\nWhile practicing for the show, stuntwoman Laura \"Dinky\" Patterson, one of a 16-member professional bungee jumping team, jumped from the 152-foot high temporary show truss hung from the roof. It collided head-first with the concrete floor, causing her death. \"The New York Times\" reported on January 29, 1997 that Patterson had been working with bungee cords that were being handled by volunteers who had received little training. The bungee-jumping portion of the halftime show was removed. A title-graphic commemorating Patterson and acknowledging her death was displayed during the TV broadcast of the Super Bowl.\nThe inclusion of a segment featuring Fox News Channel personality Catherine Crier was seen as an attempt for Fox, broadcasting their first-ever Super Bowl, to give their news channel free publicity.\nThe show was intended to create hype for the then-upcoming film \"Blues Brothers 2000\". \nSince the original Blues Brother John Belushi had died fifteen years prior, the remaining member Dan Aykroyd performed instead with Jim Belushi and John Goodman.\nSynopsis.\nThe show began with a fictional Fox News bulletin presented by Catherine Crier, announcing that Aykroyd's Blues Brothers character Elwood J. Blues had escaped the Joliet State Prison.\nThe Blues Brothers then performed the songs \"Everybody Needs Somebody to Love\" and \"Soul Man\".\nJames Brown, wearing a pink satin suit, then performed his songs \"I Got You (I Feel Good)\" and \"Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine\".\nZZ Top then appeared, entering on motorcycles, and performed their songs \"Tush\" and \"Legs\".\nAll the performers ended the show by performing \"Gimme Some Lovin'\" together.\nReception.\nCritical.\nSteve Johnson of the \"Chicago Tribune\" heavily criticized the show, particularly The Blues Brothers, likening the inclusion of ZZ Top and James Brown to placing prime roast beef \"between moldy white bread\". He also argued that The Blues Brothers were only chosen to act as \"a stealth ad for the House of Blues chain of musical malls.\"\nMany outlets have retrospectively ranked the show poorly among Super Bowl halftime shows. In 2019, Maeve McDermott of \"USA Today\" ranked the show as the second-most \"disastrous\" Super Bowl halftime show. Also in 2019, Roy Trakin and Jem Aswad of \"Variety\" ranked as one of the six \"least memorable\" Super Bowl halftime shows.\nConversely, in 2013, Dan Hyman of \"Rolling Stone\" retrospectively ranked the show as the eighth-best Super Bowl halftime show. In 2020, Aaron Tallent of Athlon Sports ranked the show well, writing, \"This performance epitomizes what a Super Bowl halftime show should be: big and fun, but not overdone and torturous to watch.\" In 2020, Daniel Tran of Yardbarker also ranked the performance well.\nCommercial.\nUpon release on February 6, 1998, \"Blues Brothers 2000\" received mixed reviews and was a box-office bomb.\nControversy.\nSome criticized the decision to have a faux news bulletin, which some may have mistaken as real. The segment was criticized as undermining the upstart Fox News Channel's journalistic integrity, as well as Crier's own."

        "text": ", located in Kawanishi, Hyogo, is one of the oldest golf courses in Japan which is held in high regard in Japan and the world.\nHistory.\nEstablishment in Naruohama.\nThe origins of golf in Japan can be traced back over a century to a small private course in Kobe's Rokko mountains. During the Meiji Period, many Europeans and Americans lived in the bay-front foreign settlement in Kobe, introducing various aspects of foreign culture into Japan.\nThe British-born trading merchant Arthur Hesketh Groom (1846–1918) built a summerhouse atop Mt. Rokko, an area he chose for its peace and quiet as a perfect location for social gatherings. There he built a four-hole golf course. Two years later, in 1903, he expanded the course to nine holes and founded the Kobe Golf Club, the first golf club in Japan.\nNew course.\nThe Naruo course was steadily expanded, and in 1924 a full 18 holes were completed. But in 1927, severe economic constraints forced the course to be shortened to nine holes.\nThe Club members were desperate for a new course, so they entrusted its development to the club's most stalwart members, the Crane brothers—Joe E., Harry C. and Bertie E. Crane. Every weekend the brothers inspected candidate sites all over the Kansai area until they happened upon the location where the present course was built.\nCourse completed in present-days form.\nHarry C. Crane had long sought validation of his course by a famous golf course designer. In 1930, Charles Hugh Alison came to Japan to design the Asaka course for the Tokyo Golf Club. He also designed golf courses in Hirono and Kawana. Crane asked Alison to survey the Naruo golf course and offer recommendations. Alison spent a full week on the project in early 1931. In his report he wrote, “The skeletal construction uses the site’s features well, and no changes are required.” At the same time he submitted detailed recommendations to improve 16 of the 18 holes.\nEpic battle of the \"Big 3\".\nOne of the biggest days in the history of the Naruo course came in 1967 when Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer—the “Big 3” among professional golfers of that era—held an exhibition match at Naruo.\nThe event was part of three stroke-play matches held around Japan and organized by Tokyo Broadcasting System Television. The first two matches were held at the Kasumigaseki Country Club East Course and the Nagoya Golf Club Wago Course, with the final round held at Naruo.\nTo a world-famous course.\nIn the mid-1990s Naruo became internationally famous through photos taken in May 1992 by the well-known golf photographer Brian Morgan. Morgan was the official photographer for the four major worldwide tournaments and a master of his craft. His shots of Naruo, taken with great skill and discerning perspective, make the course come alive, artistically depicting one of Japan's oldest courses with grace and dignity.\nCourse record.\nThe course record of Naruo was established by Tsutomu Irie.\nProfessionals.\nProfessional golfers who belong to Naruo Golf Club are;"

        "text": "The 2021 Premier Lacrosse League season was the third season of the Premier Lacrosse League (PLL). The 2021 season represented a return to the tour-based format that the league followed in 2019 after playing a bubble tournament in 2020 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. 2021 also represented a return to one unified professional Field Lacrosse format after Major League Lacrosse and the Premier Lacrosse League announced they were merging on December 16, 2020. This monumental merger saw the PLL adopt the naming rights to all former MLL teams, as well as Cannons Lacrosse Club moving from the MLL to the PLL as an 8th team set by expansion draft. The Whipsnakes Lacrosse Club were the two-time defending league champions. Chaos Lacrosse Club took revenge against Whipsnakes Lacrosse Club by defeating them in the championship game on September 19 at Audi Field by a score of 9–14.\nExpansion.\nThe addition of an eighth team, the Cannons Lacrosse Club, allows for schedule flexibility and natural bye weeks to occur for each team throughout the season. While the MLL fielded six teams last season and the PLL fielded seven, the post-merger PLL chose to expand by only one team to maintain the highest level of competition. The Cannons will form their initial PLL roster core through an expansion draft of unprotected players from the other seven clubs. Former MLL players will have a chance to join a roster through a new player draft, occurring on March 25.\nPlayer movement.\nThe 2021 PLL waiver wire and trading period began on February 9. On February 28, expansion draft protected rosters are due and the waiver wire closes. On March 11, the Cannons Lacrosse Club will conduct their expansion draft and on March 25, the entire league will participate in an entry draft for former MLL players. The waiver wire will then reopen for the Cannons on March 26 and for the rest of the teams on March 30. The 2021 collegiate draft will be held on April 6. The conclusion of player movement through trade windows and the waiver wire is set for April 30.\nWaiver wire.\nThe first league waiver wire period began on February 9. Notable players to change teams at this time included:\nTrades.\nThe following notable trades were made during the 2021 league year:\nNotable retirements.\nThe following notable players retired prior to the 2021 season:\nOther retirements\nExpansion Draft.\nThe Cannons Expansion Draft took place on Thursday, March 11 to select an initial roster from players left unprotected by their team on March 1.\nExpansion Draft Format:\nPlayer Entry Draft.\nAll former MLL players, totaling more than 100 athletes, are currently without teams. Some of these players, along with NLL and other non-collegiate athletes without professional field experience, will be selected to team rosters in a specially formulated three-round draft on March 25. The expansion Cannons will be selecting first in each round and the selection slot of other teams was determined by lottery draw on February 10.\nCollege Draft.\nDue to NCAA eligibility rules in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many college seniors returned for a fifth year of eligibility in the spring 2021 season. As a result, this year's draft on April 26 was expected to be among the most talent saturated in years. It once again aired on NBCSN beginning at 10:30 EDT and hosted by Paul Burmeister, along with analyst Ryan Boyle on the broadcast. PLL coaches called in via video call for breakdowns of their draft picks.\nFormat:\nSchedule.\nThe 2021 tour schedule will run eleven weeks long, including three playoff weekends and an All-Star game. A total of 43 games will take place in this time frame.\nChampionship.\nAfter falling in the 2020 PLL Championship in Utah last season as the underdog No. 7 seed, Chaos looked to avenge said loss against the same team this season in Whipsnakes, the two-time defending PLL champion. On the other hand, the Whips looked to solidify a dynasty to begin the PLL, hoping to secure a third title in the third year of the league's existence.\nWith a potent attack in players like Matt Rambo and Zed Williams, the Whips had the momentum and past success to favor them coming into the game on Sept. 19 at Audi Field in Washington D.C. However, it was Chaos who powered through and held that potent Whipsnakes attack silent as they won, 14-9, winning their first ever PLL Championship.\nThe Whips were held to just three goals in the second half and the aforementioned Williams/Rambo combo combined to record just two points and no goals in the championship. On the other end, it was Chaos's Dhane Smith who was the offensive star of the game and playoffs, recording a six-point game on the day. Smith had 18 points in the playoffs, averaging six points a game.\nThree other players had four points or more for Chaos on the day in Chase Fraser, Josh Byrne and Chris Cloutier. Fraser's four goals led all scorers in the game. PLL league MVP Blaze Riorden turned in another MVP performance for Chaos in the championship, recording 15 saves in the game for a .625 save percentage. Riorden received PLL Championship Game MVP honors for his performance.\nStandings.\nLast updated: August 16, 2021\nSource:\nAll Star Game.\nThe 2021 All-Star Game took place on Sunday, July 18 at PayPal Park in San Jose, California. It was broadcast on NBCSN and was sponsored by Cloudstrike, including the teams: Adversaries and Defenders. The two teams captains were Grant Ament (Archers) and Blaze Riordan (Chaos) The Adversaries won with a score of 23–21 over The Defenders. The MVP award went to goalie Tim Troutner who had 24 saves, including a behind-the-back goal, in a close win. With a total of 35 saves made in the game, $17,500 was donated to Oakland Lacrosse on behalf of Cloudstike with PLL Assist.\nAward finalists.\nOn August 19, the PLL announced the finalists for the following awards:\nAward Winners.\nSource: \nLeague leaders.\nLast Updated: August 16, 2021\nSource:"

        "text": "Cole Smith (born October 28, 1995) is an American professional ice hockey player currently playing with the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League (NHL).\nEarly life.\nSmith was born on October 28, 1995, in Brainerd, Minnesota, to Tom and Kris Smith. He was born into an athletic family as his mother, father, sister, uncle, and numerous cousins all participated in sports at the college level. His father played football at St. Cloud State University and mother ran track at Concordia College-Moorhead. His youngest sister Gabbie plays ice hockey for Bemidji State University (BSU) while his middle sister Allyson played soccer for BSU. His uncle Sandy also played collegiate hockey and played professionally for Eisbären Berlin in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga. In 2009, his mother Kris was inducted into the Concordia College Athletics Department Hall of Fame as she had set program records for indoor and outdoor long jump. Numerous members of his family were inducted into the Warrior Athletic Hall of Fame and named Brainerd Athletes of the Year.\nCareer.\nAmateur.\nGrowing up in Brainerd, Minnesota, Smith became good friends with future American Hockey League teammate Mitch McLain. Despite their two-year age difference, they played youth baseball together and participated in the U10 Little League World Series. While attending Brainerd High School from 2011 to 2014, Smith participated in three sports; ice hockey, football, and track. Smith excelled in all three sports while attending Brainerd High School. In football, he played defensive back, wide receiver, and played on special teams. During the 2013 season, Smith helped the Brainerd Warriors finish with a 12–1 record and was named to the Minnesota Vikings All-State High School Team, All-Section and All-Conference teams, and the Warriors Defensive Player of the Year. His coach Ron Stolski described him as \"a player with a great work ethic, a quiet leader who leads by example, and a difference-maker.\" He was also three-year starter for the Brainerd ice hockey team and finished his career ninth on the Warriors’ all-time scoring list with 110 total points. In track, Smith won the triple jump for Brainerd's only first-place finish in the 2014 Wayzata Invitational. After graduating, Smith was selected in the 10th round of the United States Hockey League Draft by the Sioux Falls Stampede.\nManitoba Junior Hockey League.\nSmith participated in the Stampede's tryout sessions before the 2014–15 season but was cut before the roster was finalized. He subsequently joined the Steinbach Pistons in the Canadian-based Manitoba Junior Hockey League (MJHL) due to a family connection to the head coach. In his first season with the Pistons, Smith accumulated 12 goals and 11 assists for 23 points over 38 games. He also gained the attention of scouts from the University of North Dakota (UND), Bemidji State University, and the University of Michigan. During his second season with the team, Smith greatly improved on his rookie season and led the team in scoring with 26 goals and ranked second with 61 points. His offensive efforts helped the Pistons qualify for the MJHL's Turnbull Cup where he scored seven goals and 11 assists in 15 playoff games. Smith was recognized with the MJHL's Player of the Month of April honor after recording four goals and six assists through eight playoff games. Although numerous colleges had been interested in him, only UND extended him a 20 percent scholarship. He officially committed to join UND for the 2016–17 season after visiting the school in March.\nCollege.\nSmith played college hockey for the North Dakota Fighting Hawks at the University of North Dakota from 2016 to 2020 while majoring in kinesiology. Although he struggled to earn playing time at the start of his freshman season, Smith became a regular in the lineup by the end of the season. He scored his first collegiate goal in his college debut against Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute on October 15. As the Fighting Hawks qualified for the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC) Quarterfinals, Smith assisted on the game-tying and game-winning goals in their 6–5 overtime win over St. Cloud State in Game 2. He skated in the final 12 games of the 2016–17 regular season and finished with three goals and four assists in 29 games. \nAlthough he was scratched for the Fighting Hawks 2017–18 season opener, Smith became a key player for the team as the season continued. Over the final six games of November, Smith was tied for the team lead in assists and led the team with a plus-6 rating. On December 2, Smith tied Ben Cherski's school record for fastest goal to start the third period after he scored seven seconds into the third period of a game against Western Michigan. He quickly became a mainstay on the Fighting Hawks' third line with Johnny Simonson and Trevor Olson. In the nine games leading up to the Christmas break, Smith led all UND forwards with six points and scored in three consecutive games. On January 26, Smith was suspended one game following an illegal hit to the head of University of Denver defenseman Adam Plant. Smith finished his sophomore season with a career-high five goals and five assists for 10 points.\nDuring his junior season, Smith consistently played alongside Gavin Hain and Mark Senden. The trio finished in the top three amongst team scorers and registering a combined plus-45. Smith finished his junior season with five goals and a career-high 11 assists for 16 points. He received the team's Cliff 'Fido' Purpur Award as a player who exemplifies hard work and determination and was named an American Hockey Coaches Association Division I All American Scholar.\nPrior to the start of his senior year, Smith was named an assistant captain for the Fighting Hawks. In his senior year, Smith was a key component of a Fighting Hawks team that posted the top regular season record in the NCHC, including setting a record for most consecutive home wins at the Ralph Engelstad Arena. Although the Fighting Hawks finished with the conference's regular-season title, they were unable to compete for the conference and national championships because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Smith finished the regular season with a career-high 11 goals and 18 points over 34 games and was named as a finalist for the NCHC Defensive Forward of the Year award.\nNashville Predators.\nSmith officially concluded his collegiate career on March 19, 2020, after signing a one-year contract with the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League. Ahead of the delayed 2020–21 season, Smith was given the jersey number 36 after he made his original number 15 available for veteran Brad Richardson. Before joining the Predators' training camp for the pandemic-shortened, Smith was re-assigned to their ECHL affiliate, the Florida Everblades. He played five games with the Everblades in December 2020, tallying three points, before being recalled to join the Predators' training camp. Due to the unique nature of the season, Smith was named to the Predators \"taxi squad,\" a group of players who travelled with the team to enable swift call-ups in the event of positive COVID-19 cases. One day into the regular season, Smith was recalled to the active roster and made his NHL debut on January 14, against the Columbus Blue Jackets. He recorded one shot on goal in 5:57 minutes of ice time in the Predators' 3–1 win. By making his NHL debut, Smith became the first former Pistons player to ever appear in an NHL game. This would be his only NHL game of the season as he was shortly thereafter assigned to the Predators American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Chicago Wolves, on January 21. Smith recorded his first career AHL points, a goal and assist, on February 20 in a 10–2 win over the Iowa Wild. He later recorded his first professional two-goal game on April 17 against the Rockford IceHogs, although the team would lose in a shootout. He finished the regular season with five goals and five assists for 10 points and 16 penalty minutes over 23 games. Upon concluding his rookie season with the Wolves, the Predators signed Smith to a one-year, two-way contract extension worth $750,000 at the NHL level and $70,000 at the AHL level on July 15, 2021.\nAfter attending the Predators 2021 training camp, Smith was re-assigned to their new AHL affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals, prior to the start of the 2021–22 season. On November 5, Smith scored his first goal as a member of the Admirals to help the team clinch a 2–1 win over the Manitoba Moose and snap a four-game losing streak. Following this game, Smith added two-assist against the Iowa Wild for his first multi-point contest of the season. After tallying three goals and three assists over nine games with the Admirals, Smith was recalled to the NHL level on November 13. He was returned to the Admirals on November 20 after Nick Cousins was activated from injured reserve. Upon returning to the AHL, Smith added two goals and four assists over the next 11 games for 12 total points before being recalled back to the NHL on December 16. He played that night against the Colorado Avalanche and the following night against the Chicago Blackhawks before being reassigned on December 18. Smith added five more points with the Admirals before earning his third NHL recall of the season on January 11. After going pointless in the next three games, Smith was reassigned to the Predators \"taxi squad.\" In his first game back with the Admirals on January 31, Smith scored twice to help lead the team to a 5–0 win over the Grand Rapids Griffins. Leading up to his fourth NHL recall on February 14, Smith became the fifth member of the Admirals to reach double-digits in goals and ranked sixth on the team in points with 22. Smith's efforts with the Admirals helped lift them from last place in the Central division to third place. He scored his 20th goal of the season, and second in the game, on April 16 to help the Admirals qualify for the Calder Cup playoffs for the first time since the 2018–19 season. Over his eight NHL games of the season, Smith recorded 21 hits while averaging 8:50 minutes of ice time. He finished the AHL regular season with 21 goals and 20 assists for 41 points over 59 games, the fourth most on the team. As a result of his play, Smith signed a one-year, two-way contract extension with the Predators on July 14, 2022.\nSmith began the 2022–23 season on the Predators opening night roster for the first time in his professional career. On October 7, Smith recorded his first career NHL point, an assist, in a 4–1 win over the San Jose Sharks. On January 21, 2023, in his 49th NHL game, Smith scored his first career goal to lift the Predators 5–3 over the Los Angeles Kings. Smith missed the final two weeks of the regular season to recover from the concussion, finishing with four goals and 13 assists for 17 points over 69 games. In his absence, the Predators fell three points shy of qualifying for the 2023 Stanley Cup playoffs.\nSmith began the 2023–24 season on the fourth line but was quickly bumped up onto a line with Cody Glass and Gustav Nyquist. In his first game on this line, Smith recorded an assist, two shots on goal, and four hits to lift the Predators over the Seattle Kraken on October 12. On December 21, 2023, Smith scored his first career short handed goal against the Philadelphia Flyers. On January 24, Smith signed a two-year, $2 million contract extension with the Predators. At the time, he had accumulated a career-high five goals and 13 assists for 17 points over 46 games."

        "text": "The 1986–87 Marist Red Foxes men's basketball team represented Marist College in the 1986–87 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Red Foxes, led by first-year head coach Dave Magarity, played their home games at the James J. McCann Recreation Center in Poughkeepsie, New York as members of the ECAC Metro Conference. They finished the season 20–11, 15–1 in ECACM play, finishing in first place and winning the ECAC regular season championship. As the No. 1 seed in the ECAC tournament, they advanced to the championship game, where they defeated second-seeded Fairleigh Dickinson 64–55 in overtime to win the school's second consecutive ECAC Metro men's basketball tournament title. The Red Foxes earned the automatic bid to the 1986 NCAA tournament, receiving a 14 seed in the West region. They were defeated in the first round 68–93 by No. 12 Pittsburgh.\nCoaching change.\nIn May 1986, several Marist players met with senior college administrators to discuss their complaints about the handling of the team by head coach Matthew Furjanic Jr. Several of them indicated they would not return for the 1986–87 if Furjanic, who had one year left on his contract, remained as head coach. Furjanic took over for Marist in the fall of 1984 after the forced resignation of 5-month term coach Mike Perry, who admitted committing violations of NCAA rules by offering extra benefits to a player to mask allegations and complaints of sexual advances towards the prospective recruit. Furjanic would step down a couple weeks later, citing personal reasons. On June 10, 1986, Marist hired former Saint Francis (PA) head coach Dave Magarity to replace him.\nNCAA Penalties.\nWhile the NCAA was investigating the self reported violations of 1984, 2 days before the 1986–87 season was to begin, the NCAA declared Rik Smits, Miroslav Pecarski, and Rudy Bourgarel ineligible because the NCAA said that Mike Perry illegally recruited them for Marist. The NCAA Council's subcommittee on eligibility issued a decision that Pecarski and Bourgarel's violations were minor, and their suspensions would last seven games, although stats seem to indicate it was reduced to four. Smits, facing a complete season suspension, was eventually decided on nine games. Without Smits, Marist started the season 3–6, and losing the first game he returned to.\nPrevious season.\nThe Red Foxes finished the 1985–86 season 19–12, 11–5 in ECACM play to finish in second place.

        "text": "The Super Bowl XXXVII halftime show took place on January 26, 2003 at the Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California as part of Super Bowl XXXVII. Shania Twain, No Doubt, and Sting were featured in the show, which was sponsored by AT&amp;T Wireless.\nProduction.\nThe show was produced by Jimmy Iovine and Joel Gallen and was sponsored by AT&amp;T Wireless.\nShania Twain's inclusion was announced by the NFL in early January. No Doubt then announced their inclusion the following day on their website. Ahead of the show, the producers promised that there would not be lip syncing. Speculation arose following the show that Twain lip synced her part of the performance. The show's sound producer, Paul Liszewski, claimed that Twain had sung live, but that her backing band and Twain's backing vocals were prerecorded. However, Twain later admitted that her main vocals had also been prerecorded due to concerns over sound quality. \nTwain became the first artist to have performed both the Grey Cup and Super Bowl halftime shows, having already performed the halftime show at the 90th Grey Cup months earlier.\n, Twain's performance marks the last time that a country music act has performed in a Super Bowl halftime show.\nSynopsis.\nTwain began the show by singing her song \"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\". She next performed her song \"Up!\" which was new at the time. During part of the latter song, she walked down stairs to leave the stage and stand amongst the crowd on the field. After returning to the stage, Twain got on a lift that then elevated her as fireworks were launched.\nNo Doubt then sang their hit \"Just a Girl\" with lead singer Gwen Stefani ad-libbing lines like \"I'm just a girl at the Super Bowl!\"\nThe show concluded with Sting performing \"Message in a Bottle\", with Stefani joining in midway through.\nReception.\nCritical.\nCritics praised No Doubt and Sting's portion of the show, but gave a negative reception to Twain's portion of the show. Rolling Stone magazine called Twain's performance, a “career-freezing” bomb. Some argued that Twain, who was supposed to be the main attraction of the show, instead was overshadowed by No Doubt and Sting. The rendition of \"Message in a Bottle\" was regarded as the highlight of the show by some critics.\nThe show has, retrospectively, been ranked low among Super Bowl halftime performances by a number of outlets. Other outlets have ranked it in the middle tier of halftime shows. In 2020, E! ranked it among the best. Retrospectively, Jennifer Earl and Andy Sahadeo of Fox News wrote that the show, with Twain and Stefani front and center, presented a \"girl power\" moment.\nCommercial.\nAll the performers saw their latest releases receive a boost in sales in the week following the performance. Twain's Up! saw a 41% increase, No Doubt's Rock Steady saw a 23% increase, and Sting's The Very Best of Sting &amp; The Police saw a 39% increase in sales."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Hilltoppers represent Western Kentucky University in the NCAA's Conference USA.\nWestern Kentucky began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1914. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a statistic until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Western Kentucky's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

Goal-line drop outs will be brought in for when an attacking player is held up or knocks the ball on in goal. When a kick is forced in goal by the defending team then a goal-line drop out will also take place. These rules were used successfully in the Australian 2020 Super Rugby AU season. Extra time was also used again in 2021, again consisting of a 10-minute period, however differing from the 2021 Super Rugby AU season, the team scoring the first points of any kind in this period will win the match.\nA captain's referral has also been brought in for 2021, similar to those used successfully in cricket and tennis, with New Zealand Rugby becoming the first to trial it in rugby union. Each team will be allowed one referral per match which can be used in one of three scenarios: a decision occurring in the final five minutes of a match, an offence in the build up to a try being scored or an act of foul play. All other law variations from the 2020 season will again be used in the 2021 season.\nRound-by-round.\nThe table below shows the progression of all teams throughout the 2021 Super Rugby Aotearoa season.

It was the season-ending event for the highest-ranked singles players and doubles teams on the 2021 ATP Tour.\nThis was the 52nd edition of the tournament (47th in doubles), and the first time Turin hosted the ATP Tour year-end championships.\nChampions.\nSingles.\n Alexander Zverev def. Daniil Medvedev, 6–4, 6–4\nDoubles.\n Pierre-Hugues Herbert / Nicolas Mahut def. Rajeev Ram / Joe Salisbury, 6–4, 7–6(7–0)\nPoints and prize money.\nThe ATP Finals currently (2021) rewards the following points and prize money, per victory:\nTournament.\nFormat.\nThe ATP Finals group stage had a round-robin format, with eight players/teams divided into two groups of four and each player/team in a group playing the other three in the group. The eight seeds were determined by the ATP rankings and ATP Doubles Team Rankings on the Monday after the last ATP Tour tournament of the calendar year. All singles matches, including the final, were best of three sets with tie-breaks in each set including the third. All doubles matches were two sets (no ad) and a Match Tie-break.\nIn deciding placement within a group, the following criteria were used, in order:\nCriteria 4–6 were used only in the event of a three-way tie; if one of these criteria decided a winner or loser among the three, the remaining two would have been ranked by head-to-head result.\nThe top two of each group advanced to semifinals, with the winner of each group playing the runner-up of the other group. The winners of the semifinals then played for the title.\nQualification.\nSingles.\nEight players compete at the tournament, with two named alternates. Players receive places in the following order of precedence:\nIn the event of this totaling more than 8 players, those lower down in the selection order become the alternates. If further alternates are needed, these players are selected by the ATP.\nProvisional rankings are published weekly as the \"ATP Race to Turin\", which only counts events played in 2021. Points are accumulated in Grand Slam, ATP Tour, ATP Cup, ATP Challenger Tour and ITF Tour tournaments. Players accrue points across 19 tournaments, usually made up of:\nAll players must include the ranking points for mandatory Masters tournaments for which they are on the original acceptance list and for all Grand Slams for which they would be eligible, even if they do not compete (in which case they receive zero points). Furthermore, players who finished 2020 in the world's top 30 are \"commitment players\" who must (if not injured) include points for the 8 mandatory Masters tournament regardless of whether they enter, and who must compete in at least 4 ATP 500 tournaments (though the Monte Carlo Masters may count to this total), of which one must take place after the US Open. Zero point scores may also be taken from withdrawals by non-injured players from ATP 500 tournaments according to certain other conditions outlined by the ATP. Beyond these rules, however, a player may substitute his next best tournament result for missed Masters and Grand Slam tournaments.\nPlayers may have their ATP Tour Masters 1000 commitment reduced by one tournament, by reaching each of the following milestones:\nIf a player satisfies all three of these conditions, their mandatory ATP Tour Masters 1000 commitment is dropped entirely. Players must be in good standing as defined by the ATP as to avail of the reduced commitment.\nDoubles.\nEight teams compete at the tournament, with one named alternates. The eight competing teams receive places according to the same order of precedence as in singles. The named alternate will be offered first to any unaccepted teams in the selection order, then to the highest ranked unaccepted team, and then to a team selected by the ATP. Points are accumulated in the same competitions as for the singles tournament. However, for Doubles teams there are no commitment tournaments, so teams are ranked according to their 19 highest points scoring results from any tournaments on the ATP Tour.\nGroupings.\nSingles.\nThe singles draw of the 2021 edition of the Year–end Championships will feature one number one, two major champions and three major finalists. The competitors were divided into two groups.\nDoubles.\nThe doubles draw of the 2021 edition of the Year–end Championships will feature four number-ones, six major champions and one major finalist team. The pairs were divided into two groups.\nHead-to-head records.\nBelow are the head-to-head records as they approached the tournament.\nSingles.\nOverall"

        "title": "2022 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC fourth round",
        "text": "The fourth round of AFC matches for the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification consisted of a single match that determined the AFC representative in the intercontinental play-offs against the CONMEBOL representative. This round was originally scheduled as a two-legged tie for 11 and 16 November 2021, but the dates and format were changed in November 2020 in response to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic in Asia.\nThe match featured the United Arab Emirates and Australia. It was played at Ahmad bin Ali Stadium in Al Rayyan, Qatar, on 7 June 2022.\nBackground.\nSince the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification, the last round of the Asian qualifiers (in this case, the fourth round) had consisted of a matchup between two teams coming from a previous round, and the winning team would represent AFC in the intercontinental play-offs (except the 1998 campaign, in which the play-off winners qualified directly for the FIFA World Cup, while the losers advanced to the intercontinental play-offs).\nThe United Arab Emirates had previously played once at this stage; they faced Iran in the 2002 play-off and lost 0–4 on aggregate. Australia had also previously played at this stage once; it was the previous 2018 edition, where they defeated Syria 3–2 on aggregate.\nThis was the third match between the United Arab Emirates and Australia in AFC World Cup qualifying, with the previous two meetings being Australian victories (both in the 2018 qualifiers).\nFormat.\nIn the fourth round, the two third-placed teams from the third round competed in a single-match play-off. Since the fourth round format was changed from two-legged tie to a single-match at a neutral venue, the game was played under the single-leg play-off rules from the preliminary competition, with extra time of two periods of 15 minutes would be played if the match was tied after the regular time of 90 minutes, followed by a penalty shoot-out to decide the winner if the match still tied after extra time (Regulations Article 20.11).\nThe winner advanced to the intercontinental play-offs six days later, also in Qatar.\nQualified teams.\nThe United Arab Emirates qualified for the fourth round after finishing third of Group A in the third round. Previously, they had won their group in the second round, winning six and losing two of their eight matches, leaving Vietnam (by only 1 point), Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia behind. In the third round, the UAE were part of Group A, alongside Iran, South Korea, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. They finished third with 12 points and a record of 3 wins, 3 draws and 4 losses, behind Iran and South Korea who qualified directly for the final tournament.\nAustralia also qualified by finishing third in the third round (Group B). Previously, they had won their group in the second round, winning all eight of their matches and taking a 10-point lead over Kuwait and Jordan in second and third place respectively, with Nepal and Chinese Taipei far behind. In the third round, Australia were part of Group B, alongside Saudi Arabia, Japan, Oman, China PR and Vietnam. They finished third with 15 points and a record of 4 wins, 3 draws and 3 losses, behind Saudi Arabia and Japan who qualified directly for the final tournament.\nThe United Arab Emirates started the qualification process with Dutchman Bert van Marwijk. However, he was sacked on 12 February 2022 after the team ran out of direct qualification options as Iran and South Korea had secured the first two places of Group A in the third round. Argentine Rodolfo Arruabarrena was announced as the UAE's new coach one day later, while Australia kept Graham Arnold as their coach throughout the process.\nMatch.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "text": "Bob Griffin (; born June 24, 1950) is an American-Israeli former basketball player. He played the point guard and shooting guard positions. He played basketball in the Israeli Basketball Premier League from 1972 to 1979. He is now an Associate Professor of English Literature at Texas A&amp;M University.\nBiography.\nRobert (Bob) Griffin grew up in Port Washington, on the North Shore of Long Island in New York State, and attended Paul D. Schreiber Senior High School ('68). He is 5' 10\" (180 cm) tall.\nHe then attended Columbia University, and played for the Columbia Lions basketball team in 1969–70. Griffin dropped out of Columbia after two years, in 1970.Griffin completed his B.A. at Tel Aviv University (English and Classics; '79). He retired from basketball to go to graduate school at Yale University (English Language and Literature; M.A. '80, M.Phil. '82, Ph.D. '85). He wrote his doctoral dissertation on Samuel Johnson, the 18th-century essayist, poet, lexicographer, and editor who undertook to compile the first modern English-language dictionary, and Griffin focused on the notion of reflection, a key concept for Johnson. Griffin taught English Literature at Bowdoin College in Maine (1983–87) and Tel Aviv University (for 18 years; 1987–2005), and is now an Associate Professor at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas (since 2005).\nGriffin married Ariela, an accountant for the Steimatzky bookstore of Yemeni-Jewish descent, whom he met at a bus stop in Israel. In 1977 they had a daughter in Israel, Becky Griffin, who became an Israeli model, TV presenter, and actress, and in 1983 they had a son, Oren Griffin, who works in the Israeli high-tech sector. When he retires, Griffin plans to return to his home in Tel Aviv.\nBasketball career.\nVisiting friends from the Columbia University basketball team who were playing in Israel, Griffin ended up playing basketball in the Israeli Basketball Premier League from 1972 to 1979, for Maccabi Ramat Gan and Maccabi Tel Aviv. A Jewish-American, he became an Israeli citizen under Israel's Law of Return. The highlight was playing for the Maccabi Tel Aviv team that won the 1976–77 FIBA European Champions Cup. In the semifinals, he recalled: \"No one gave us a chance to win. The most that people (in Israel) were hoping for was that we didn't lose by too much. CSKA Moscow (the Russian Red Army team) had beaten Real Madrid, one of the elite teams in Europe, by 20 points the previous week in Madrid... Our attitude was, maybe they beat Madrid last week, but they still have to beat us this week.\" Maccabi Tel Aviv beat the Russian Red Army 91 to 79. Griffin won three Israeli titles with the team."

        "text": "Douglas R. Ferguson was a Canadian ice hockey Center who was a two-time All-American for Cornell and helped the team win its first NCAA Championship.\nCareer.\nFerguson was a prominent junior player for the Melville Millionaires, along his twin brother Dave, in 1963. That summer, Ned Harkness had become the new head coach for Cornell and sought to build a program that could win an national title. He sold his vision to the Ferguson brothers and the pair, with younger brother Bob, all became members of Harkness' first recruiting class for the Big Red. Harkness had already won a championship with RPI in 1954 and there was hope he could replicate that success in Ithaca. Doug, as most players did, sat out his freshman season due to the then-NCAA regulations limiting students to 3 years of varsity play. When he debuted for the team as a sophomore alongside his siblings the program saw an immediate improvement. Doug led the Big Red in scoring, finishing tied for 5th in the nation with 55 points, and Cornell went from a middling 12–10 to a respectable 19–7. The Big Red fell in the team's first ever postseason game, losing 3–4 to Brown in overtime, but Ferguson and the Big Red had only just introduced themselves.\nDoug was named team co-captain as a junior and led the Big Red to a stellar season. Ferguson led not only the team but the entire nation in scoring, scoring 71 points and setting a program record with 37 goals (still a Cornell record as of 2020). While Ferguson was named as an All-American and to the All-ECAC First Team, Cornell finished third in ECAC Hockey and the team sought its first conference championship in over 50 years. After obliterating Boston College in the quarterfinals, Cornell shocked Boston University with an 8–1 drubbing in the semifinal. The team wasn't able to overcome Clarkson for the championship, but the 2nd-place finish garnered Cornell an invitation to the 1966 NCAA Tournament. Unfortunately, due to an ongoing argument between the NCAA and the Ivy League over player eligibility, Cornell had to decline the invitation as well as their first appearance in a national tournament.\nFortunately for the Ferguson brothers, the argument was settled prior to the 1966–67 season and Cornell now had a chance to make the championship. Doug became an alternate captain for the year, turning the captaincy over to his twin Dave. the team also welcomed the best player I program history, Ken Dryden, to the varsity team. Dryden had originally been a Princeton recruit before Harkness' plan and the vast improvement by Cornell in Ferguson's sophomore season convinced him to change schools. Doug's scoring declined as a senior and he finished 4th in the nation, though he still led the Big Red with 61 points. The team had become a defensive juggernaut, however, and lost only one game during the regular season. Cornell was unable to win a regular season title, however, because Boston University hadn't lost a single conference game and the two had tied their only meeting on the year. Ferguson was still considered the leader for the team and he was named as the ECAC Player of the Year as well as earning a second stint as an All-American. As they had the year before, Cornell utterly dominated their first two opponents in the ECAC Tournament, winning by a combined score of 23–4. The championship game saw the nation's top two teams face off for the conference title and BU proved to nearly be Cornell's equal. Doug assisted on his brother's goal to open the scoring and then tied the game with a marker of his own at the start of the third. Ferguson's third point of the game came as an assist on Mike Doran's game-winner and Cornell won its first ECAC championship. Ferguson was named as the Most Outstanding Player in Tournament and guaranteed Cornell its first NCAA tournament appearance.\nAfter narrowly escaping a game North Dakota squad in the semifinals, Cornell met Boston University for the third time in the program's first championship game. Ferguson scored his only goal of the tournament on the power play halfway through the game but it was more than enough as Dryden allowed just a single BU goal and Cornell won the national title. Ferguson was named to the All-Tournament Second Team along with his twin and the three Ferguson brothers ended their college careers the best way possible.\nDoug continued his playing career after graduating, playing senior hockey for several seasons and eventually won the EHL championship with the Syracuse Blazers in 1973. After that season Ferguson got a chance as a professional with Rochester Americans but he could not find the same success and required after the following season. he was inducted into the Cornell Athletic Hall of Fame in 1979 and currently sits 4th on the program's all-time scoring list despite playing far fewer games than the three players above him.\nPersonal life.\nDoug was predeceased by his twin Dave (July 10, 1977) and died on November 10, 2003. Younger brother Bob died on October 3, 2010."

Initially, the films were created as gifts to troops fighting in World War II, to give them a brief recap of baseball action back home. This was a tradition that lasted until 2022 as there is no World Series film announced for the 2023 Texas Rangers season.\nNarration.\nLew Fonseca worked on World Series highlight films from their inception in 1943 through 1969, as an editor and director, and narrated the World Series films from 1949 to 1953 and 1955-58 (Jack Brickhouse narrated the 1954 World Series film.) Television sportscaster Bob Costas wrote of Fonseca's narration: \"[his] vocal stylings were somewhat less than mellifluous, but still endlessly entertaining.\"\nChuck Thompson was the narrator of the official 1966 World Series highlight film jointly produced by both major leagues.\nCurt Gowdy was the narrator of several Red Sox highlight films during his tenure in Boston which described the season in depth along with its key moments; this would lead to him eventually narrating World Series highlight films during his time with NBC (1968–1974, '77).\nProduction.\nWhile 1943 served as the first time that an official World Series highlight film would be produced, 1959 would mark the first time that it would be produced in color. Ten years later, the highlight films would now contain material exclusive interviews, sound from wireless microphones, and camera angles not seen on the live television coverage. Come 1982, the highlight films would become videotaped productions.\nBefore moving to Los Angeles from New York, David M. Israel was a writer, producer and editor for Major League Baseball, working on such projects as \"This Week in Baseball\", the 1986 New York Mets Highlight Film, and several World Series Highlight Films.\")\nJeff Scott wrote every official World Series film from 1988-2014 (with the exception of 1999).\nHome media releases.\nOn November 10, 2009, the World Series highlight films were released by A&amp;E Home Video (distributed by New Video) on DVD in Region 1 under the title \"The Official World Series Film Collection\" for the first time.\nThe highlight films since 2014 are available for streaming online on Tubi, while some highlight films are available for streaming online on Pluto TV."

In 1962 Hill followed his defensive partner Fisher to Minnesota–Duluth. The Bulldogs were in the process of transition to the top level of college hockey but were playing as an independent. This allowed Hill to start playing for UMD as a freshman and he proved to be one of the top Bulldogs defenders from the start. When he was a senior Hill's team joined the WCHA and, to very little surprise, the team finished last in their first season of conference play. Despite this, Hill was named as the program's first All-American.\nAfter graduating Hill remained in the area and worked as a teacher. He became the head coach of the hockey team at Denfeld High School in 1970 and earned a Master's degree the following year. He remained at Denfield until 1984 when he returned to his old high school, Duluth East, to coach both of his sons on the hockey team, as well as Dick Fisher's son Dave. Hill retired after the 1986 season and was inducted into the Minnesota–Duluth Athletic Hall of Fame in 1995.\nPersonal life.\nHill's two sons, Noel and Sean both played college hockey after being coached by their father in high school. Noel played at Wisconsin–Eau Claire while Sean attended Wisconsin–Madison and went on to a 17-year NHL career."

After being selected to the US National Team for the 1968 Winter Olympics, Casey was killed in a car accident at the age of 23.\nCareer.\nCasey was star player in Great Falls, joining the local senior amateur team when he was a freshman in high school. Though he was undersized, Casey was a fast skater and had an ability to avoid others on the ice. After graduating in 1962 he began attending the University of North Dakota and played on the freshman team while the varsity club won a national championship. His turn came the following year but Casey had a little difficulty adjusting to college hockey. He seemed to have things figured out in his junior year, however, and tied for the team lead in goals as the Fighting Sioux posted 25 wins and finished 3rd in the NCAA Tournament.\nCasey was named team captain for his senior season and led the team in scoring, finishing tied for fourth in the nation with 54 points. He was named to the All-WCHA First Team and was an All-American. UND finished second in the conference but were stymied in the second round by Denver and missed a chance to return to the national tournament.\nAfter graduating, Casey joined the US National Team for the 1967 Ice Hockey World Championships and scored two goals for the 5th-place team. The result ensured the US a spot in the 1968 Winter Olympics and shortly after the '67 championships Casey was named to the Olympic roster.\nThat summer Casey was heading to a softball tournament in Plentywood when the car he was traveling in crossed the center divide and struck another vehicle traveling in the opposite direction. Casey, as well as fellow passengers Bob Fairfull and Danny Ryan were killed while driver John Evankovich survived. All men were from Great Falls. The driver of the other car, Alice Riley, survived along with her four children, but two of her passengers, William Strowbridge and his wife Bonnie, were also killed. An investigation reveled that the speedometer from Riley's car read 43 MPH while Evankovich's, which had been thrown more than 100 away from the car, read 90. Evankovich was given a 2-year deferred sentence that December after pleading guilty to vehicular manslaughter. Almost two years later the widows of the three men filed a $2.25 million lawsuit against the Ford Motor Company for making a car with faulty power steering. The case was settled in 1971 with the plaintiffs being awarded approximately $300,000 by a district court. According to a witness at the trial, the speed of Evankovich's 1967 Ford Galaxie was never brought up.\nAfter his death, North Dakota retired Casey's #12 and has never issued the number to another player. In 2011 the Fighting Sioux raised a banner to the roof with Casey's number, becoming only the second player in the history of the program to receive that honor."

        "text": "Britt Reid (born April 28, 1985) is a former American football coach and convicted felon. He most recently served as an outside linebackers coach for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). His coaching career began when he worked for his father Andy Reid as a Practice Squad Coach Intern in 2009 with the Philadelphia Eagles and continued as he worked in multiple defensive coaching positions for his father with the Kansas City Chiefs from 2013 to 2020. Reid won Super Bowl LIV as the Chiefs' linebackers and outside linebackers coach.\nFollowing the 2020 season, his contract expired and he was not offered a new contract due to legal issues that occurred towards the end of the season.\nEarly years.\nReid is the son of Andy Reid. For four years, he played football at Harriton High School, in the suburbs of Philadelphia, serving as the team captain for three seasons. Reid played in the East-West All-Star Game as a senior. He attended college at Temple University and received a bachelor's degree in communications.\nCoaching career.\nIn 2008, Reid was an assistant offensive line coach at St. Joseph's Preparatory School in Philadelphia. In 2009, he was a training camp coordinator intern for the Philadelphia Eagles, under his father, Andy Reid. Prior to his graduation, Reid served as a student assistant for the Temple football program for two seasons assisting the offense. Reid also spent two years (2011–12) working at the Steve Addazio football camp. Following his graduation, he joined his father on the Kansas City Chiefs coaching staff in 2013 as the Defensive Quality Control Coach. This was followed by Assistant Defensive Line Coach in 2015, the Defensive Line Coach from 2016 to 2018, and the Linebackers/outside linebackers Coach, which he held until 2020.\nLegal troubles.\nIn 2007, Britt was sentenced to 8 to 23 months in jail alongside his brother Garrett for running what a Norristown, Pennsylvania, judge then called a \"drug emporium\" out of the Reid residence.\nThe same year, in 2007, Reid was involved in a road rage incident in which he allegedly pointed a gun at another man's face. A lawsuit was eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed sum in 2014.\nReid crashed into two parked cars on February 4, 2021, injuring two young children near the Chiefs' training complex, just a few days before Super Bowl LV. Reid admitted to officers he had consumed two to three drinks earlier in the evening and was on Adderall, a prescription medication used to treat attention deficit disorder. Two hours after the crash, according to a probable cause statement, Reid had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.113, above the legal limit of 0.08. Reid, as well as a five-year-old passenger of another vehicle, were both hospitalized. The five-year-old passenger was in critical condition and spent ten days in a coma. On April 2, 2021, roughly two months after the accident, the five-year-old girl was released from the hospital, still unable to walk or talk and being fed through a feeding tube. The incident led the Chiefs to not renew Reid's contract, which expired at the end of the 2020 season. On April 12, he was charged with a DWI, which is a class D felony in Missouri, which carries a maximum sentence of seven years in prison. On November 19, 2021, the Kansas City Chiefs announced that they would pay for all of the medical expenses for the five-year-old, giving her medical care and providing her and her family long-term financial stability. He pleaded guilty to the charges on September 12, 2022, as part of a plea deal. The plea deal resulted in his sentence ranging from probation to four years in prison. He was sentenced to 3 years in prison on November 1, 2022.\nOn March 1, 2024, the governor of Missouri Mike Parson commuted Reid’s sentence, and Reid will serve the remainder of his term under house arrest until October 31, 2025."

After helping the club reach its best finish in 1958, Sullivan was recruited by John MacInnes and arrived in Houghton in the fall. After a year with the freshman team, Sullivan provided depth scoring for Michigan Tech as the team progressed all the way to the 1960 national championship but were stymied by Denver. While the team as a whole had a down year in 1961, Sullivan increased his scoring production, leading the team and setting up the Huskies for a huge year.\nThe 1961–62 season began poorly for MTU with the Huskies dropping their first two games. After that, however, the team bore down and nearly ran the table, winning 29 of their succeeding 30 games. Team captain Sullivan led the squad in both goals (30) and points (59), and was named to both the All-WCHA First Team and West All-American team. After helping Michigan Tech win the first singular WCHA tournament championship, Sullivan led the huskies to dominating wins over St. Lawrence and Clarkson to capture the program's first national championship. Sullivan scored four points in the title game and was named to the All-Tournament Second Team.\nAfter graduating, Sullivan continued his playing career, playing a year with the Green Bay Bobcats before travelling to Finland and playing with HIFK for two years. He returned to the Bobcats in 1965 and returned to the Iron Range two years later as a player for the Marquette Iron Rangers. Sullivan stayed with Marquette for six seasons before retiring in 1973. In 1975 he made his head coaching debut with Marquette Senior High School and led the team for the next 19 years. In his time with the Redmen, Sullivan won two state championships (1977 and 1988) and finished as runner-up twice. He finished his career with a record of 312–158–13 () and was inducted into the Upper Peninsula Sports Hall of Fame in 1998. He had previously been enshrined in the Michigan Tech Sports Hall of Fame in 1986."

These five are also included this season but the calendar is expanded further to sixteen races, with last season's cancelled races in Antwerp, Besançon, Hoogerheide, Koksijde, Waterloo and Zonhoven returning to the calendar, as well as the race in Iowa which last featured in the 2019–20 season. Entirely new will be the races in Fayetteville (United States), Flamanville (France), Rucphen (Netherlands) and Val di Sole (Italy).\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the race in Antwerp was annulled."

In his sophomore season, Hogan helped the Eagles compile a 19–5–1 record, but the team was passed over for the NCAA Tournament. The very next season BC joined with 27 other eastern teams to form ECAC Hockey and the Eagles set their sights on another postseason bid. Hogan led the Eagles in goals (24) and points (45) and was named an All-American and First Team All-ECAC. The Eagles made the inaugural conference tournament as the 5th seed and were defeated in the quarterfinal.\nIn his senior season, Hogan increased his point production again, rising to 59 points and leading the Eagles into the conference tournament as the No. 1 seed. The Eagles reached the finals and played a tight contest against long-time rival Harvard, ultimately falling 3–4 in overtime. Because the ECAC possessed every top Division team in the east, Boston College was nearly assured a bid into the tournament as the second seed and when Harvard declined the invitation (the only conference champion to ever do so) they were given the top eastern seed. Despite high hopes, the Eagles played poorly in the championship, losing the semifinal 2–8 to North Dakota and then dropping the consolation game to Clarkson. Hogan received a consolation after the season by receiving the Walter Brown Award given to the best American-born college hockey player in the East.\nHogan was inducted into the Boston College Athletic Hall of Fame in 1979."

        "title": "1935 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1935 Auckland Rugby League season was its 27th. The senior championship was again won by the Richmond Rovers who had won their first ever Fox Memorial title the previous season. They were level with Mount Albert after 12 matches and the two teams played off for the championship with Richmond winning 14–9. Despite their loss this was a significant achievement by Mount Albert who were in their first ever season in the senior first grade.\nNewton Rangers who were in the middle of a revival after several poor seasons won the Roope Rooster trophy for the third time in their history with a 10–8 win over Richmond. They had previously won it in 1919 and 1920. This qualified them to play against Richmond in the Stormont Shield match. They lost 26–15 to hand Richmond their second straight Stormont Shield title. Ponsonby United won the Phelan Shield for teams who had been eliminated after the first round of the Roope Rooster with an 11–8 win over Mount Albert. Marist Old Boys won the reserve grade competition (Norton Cup) after defeating Richmond Rovers in the final by 3 points to 0. They also won the Stallard Cup when they won the knockout competition which also involved some of the Senior B teams. Mount Albert won the Thistle Cup by scoring the most competition points in the second round of the Fox Memorial competition. Robert Morrissey of Mount Albert won the champion goal kicker award after he kicked 37 goals in the Fox Memorial and Roope Rooster competitions.\nThe reinstated Senior B competition (Sharman Cup) was won by Otahuhu with an 8 win, 1 loss record with Papakura second with 7 wins and 2 losses. Left trailing well behind was Point Chevalier, and Waiuku with a single win and 7 losses each. At the end of the season the newly formed Green Lane senior side joined these 4 sides in the Senior B knockout competition. They performed well losing narrowly to Papakura and Point Chevalier, and defeating Waiuku to finish 4th of the 5 sides. The knockout competition was won by Papakura. This competition was followed by the Walmsley Shield matches which Papakura won 6–2 over Green Lane in the final.\nThe representative season was marked by the clash between Auckland and Australia who were touring New Zealand for the first time in 16 years. Auckland went down in an entertaining match 8–16. There were several trial matches played as the selectors looked to find the best possible XIII's to represent both Auckland and the North Island. Auckland also went on a brief 'Southern' tour where they had wins over Wellington and Canterbury. The representative season was finished with an Auckland Province loss to Australia 18–36.\n \n \nSeason News.\nAnnual meeting.\nAt the annual meeting on April 9 the report and balance sheet was presented. It was noted that despite there being rain on ten Saturdays during the 1934 season there was a “marked increase in ground and grandstand receipts”. The working account balance had improved from £762 7/9 in 1933 to £1,254 0/9 by the end of 1934 with gate and grandstand returns totalling £2,814 10/3. The league's assets were valued at £10,983 16/7 made up from Carlaw Park (£6,980 11/2), grandstand (£3,686 10/9), furniture and fittings (£101 6/2), and plant and gear (£181 13/10), which left a profit of £435 18/4. Adjustments to the players’ insurance scheme and fewer accidents saw a saving of over £70. The league gave £429 17/3 to the clubs which was slightly up on the 1933 season. The report also noted the retirement of Messrs. F. Ellis (treasurer), T. Davis (secretary, Junior Control Board), and to Mr. Vic Simpson (secretary, Referees Association). The following were elected as officers for the 1935 season: patron, Mr. J.B. Donald; vice-patron, Mr. J.F.W. Dickson; president, James Carlaw; chairman, Mr. Grey Campbell; deputy chairman, Ted Phelan; vice-presidents, Messrs R.D. Bagnall, R. Benson, J. Bellamy, O. Blackwood, J. Donald, C. Drysdale, H. Grange, R.J. Laird, W.J. Lovett, John A. Lee (M.P.), J. Montgomery, E. Morton, Joe Sayegh, C. Seagar, Bill Schramm (M.P.), R.T. Sharman, W. Wallace, H. Walmsley, G.T. Wright, R.H. Wood, G.C.Gilmore, and Webb; club delegates to the board of control, J.W. Probert, and Jim Rukutai; referees’ delegate, William Mincham. In mid April Mr. Ernest Davis, and Mr. T.G. Symonds (managing director of George Court and Sons Ltd.) were elected vice-presidents of ARL.\nThe 3rd annual Auckland Rugby League ball was held on October 2 at the Peter Pan Cabaret. Members of the touring Australian team were in attendance and the combined colours of the Auckland clubs were used to decorate the ballroom.\nThe following were elected to the ARL Board of Control: hon secretary, Mr. Ivan Culpan; hon treasurer, Mr. J.E. Knowling; New Zealand Council delegate, Mr. R. Doble; hon solicitor, Mr. H.M. Rogerson; press steward, Mr. R. Doble; hon. auditor, Mr. R.A. Spinley; hon physicians, Drs. Tracey Inglis, Pezaro, Gwynne, Holdgate, Waddell, Burrell, and Locke; hon masseur, Mr. F. Flannagan; timekeepers, Messrs. W. Liversidge and A.E. Chapman; referees appointment board, Mr. L Binns and Wilkie; emergency committee, the chairman, secretary and Mr. Rukutai; finance committee, the chairman, secretary and Messrs. Probert and William Mincham. In mid April Mr. Ernest Davis, and Mr. T.G. Symonds (managing director of George Court and Sons Ltd.) were elected vice-presidents of ARL.\nState of the game.\nAt the dinner for the Taranaki and South Auckland teams following their representative matches with Auckland and Auckland B on August 3 a dinner was held in their honour. Present was the Minister of Education, Hon. Sydney George Smith, who spoke of the importance of sport in helping New Zealand through difficult times. Later in the evening Mr. E. Stallworthy “expressed a hope that no discrimination would be made in schools in the matter of organised sport”... and “drew the Minister's attention to the fact that sometimes teachers had seemed somewhat biased against rugby league football, and he hoped that the ruling of his predecessor that any penalty imposed on a boy for following his desires in sport, or obstruction thereto, would be a matter for serious inquiry”. The Minister responded “I may say that I have no objection to any code of football being played in the schools”. And he then went on the explain how the responsibility lay in the case of primary schools with the education board of the district, and for secondary schools with their governing boards. He said that headmasters and teachers would be unwise to go against the desires of parents and their children in regards to wanting to play any particular game.\nAt a social function at Masterton on July 24 Bert Cooke spoke about the league and union codes. He said that most of the rumours about large sums in connection with league were pure imagination. He went on to say that the league code was drawing thousands in Auckland where rugby drew hundreds and that there was no doubt which game the Northerners would sooner watch. Describing the game as being \"faster, cleaner and a more brainy game altogether, but players required to be very fit. Nevertheless, he did not anticipate that league would make as great progress elsewhere as in Auckland\".\nBroadcasting of matches.\nAt the board of control meeting on April 17 it was decided to broadcast matches from Carlaw Park through the 1ZB station.\nTrainings.\nAt their first board of control meeting on April 10 the chairman suggested that clubs try to get their own training grounds where possible so that they could train harder and develop tactics without other teams training nearby seeing them. This was difficult to do at Carlaw Park with many teams training at the same time. It was also decided that school boys would not be allowed to train after 7pm owing to the needs of other teams.\nReintroduction of the Senior B grade.\nAt the board of control meeting on March 6 it was decided to create a Senior B Grade. There had been one for several seasons but after the senior competition was restructured in 1931 to include 6 clubs with reserve grade teams beneath them the Senior B clubs were relegated to the second Grade competition. It was recommended by the junior management secretary, Mr. W.F. Clarke that players in the Senior B grade would have the same status as Senior A players with regard to regrading. It was suggested that the Sharman Cup be donated for the Senior B championship, and the Foster Shield for the knockout competition. The third open grade would be eliminated and now effectively become the second grade (which had been superseded by the Senior B grade). The third grade would still have a weighted grade competition. It was also decided that the winner of the grade would have the right to enter the Roope Rooster competition. Otahuhu United won the competition and played a friendly match with Ponsonby United before losing to Newton Rangers in the first round of the Roope Rooster. At the April 17 board of control meeting there was considerable debate about whether the winners of the Senor B grade should be allowed to play the last placed team in the Fox Memorial competition, even if there was no consequence to the game. From 1927 to 29 promotion-relegation games were played between these teams but were ceased). It was generally decided that it would be unfair for the last placed team in the top division to have such dire consequences hanging over them. It was also noted that the winning Senior B team could compete in the Roope Rooster competition anyway. At the Junior Management Committee meeting of April 23 it was reported that there would be six teams in the senior B grade - Papatoetoe, Otahuhu, Ellerslie, Point Chevalier, Richmond, and Waiuku. Waiuku were a new club, while Richmond's entry was described as “a fresh city side”. Ultimately Papatoetoe dd not field a side meaning there were 5 teams and 1 bye each round. It was felt later in the season that Waiuku had been so ambitious in fielding a Senior B side when they were a fledging club and would have been better placed fielding their team in the second Grade.\nApplication by Mount Albert United for senior status.\nAt the first meeting of the Auckland Rugby League Board of Control on February 27 the Mount Albert United club applied for senior status. Chairman G. Grey Campbell said that the constitution allowed only six senior clubs and if there was to be an alteration there would need to be a notice of motion, along with a meeting of club delegates, with the Board of Control having the final say. The Mount Albert delegates Mr J. Johnson and G.H. Shaw said that the club wished a decision to be made early as they needed to organise before the season started and that they “would field first class senior and reserve grade teams, with much district support”. At the boards first official meeting on April 10 it was decided to admit the Mount Albert United club to the senior grade which meant it would consist of 7 teams. Mr. G. Grey Campbell said that he had looked at the names of the players which Mount Albert had submitted and they were all well recognised seniors. He also stated that there was a “strict reservation that this season no transfers from any other rugby league club be allowed, the idea being that a new club should not be strengthened at the expense of the existing clubs, which should be protected”. He also went on to say that “he felt sure Mount Albert would bring life to the competition and there were great possibilities behind the move”. Mr. R Doble spoke in support of the application by Mount Albert. On the motion of Mr. Probert to admit Mount Albert it was confirmed by vote.\nRules.\nAt the board of control meeting on May 1 after the consideration of reports it was “decided to advise senior clubs that the new play the ball and hooking rules would be more rigidly enforced from next Saturday”. Players would be given the opportunity to “brush up” on the rules by attending referee demonstrations on Tuesday and Thursday evenings. It was scheduled that all coaches and team captains would meet on April 24 at a Referees Association conference to discuss the new amendments to the playing rules. The play the ball rule stated that “players playing the ball must keep both feet on the ground until the ball has been placed thereon and the players acting as respective halfbacks must stand one yard behind the player playing the ball. All other players must not approach within three yards and be behind the acting halfbacks”. In addition to this the “offside rule of five yards radius within which players are offside is now increased to 10 yards”. While a drop out from touch now necessitated that “the attacking player must stand five yards away from the goal line, and when the game is restarted the ball must be kicked from behind the goal posts, and must reach this five yard mark. Formerly the attacking player stood on the goal line”.\nAt a control board meeting on May 8 there was a question from a club regarding injured players and replacements. The response was: “(1) An injured player can be replaced up to the end of the first spell; (2) an injured player is one incapable of carrying on in play; (3) a team which plays twelve players in the first half is entitled to add a player, even in the second half, because the laws of the game provide for thirteen men a side; (4) players or officials of a club are not entitled to convene meetings of players with members of another club”.\nAfter complaints from junior grades regarding players wearing boots with illegal sprigs the referees association said that they had no right to police this. However the referees association received official advice from the control board meeting on May 20 that they did indeed have the right to inspect players boots to ensure that boots, whether \"Bakelite or Aluminium were not dangerous\".\nOn August 5 at the ARL Referees’ Association meeting Mr. W. Mincham reported that the control board had ruled that a player leaving the field sick could not be replaced, but an injured player could be. The matter had arisen after an incident in a third grade match at Victoria Park. Mr Saunders, the referee said that the \"ambulance man\" had told him that the player was \"suffering from concussion as well as influenza\" and the matter had been misreported to the control board.\nCarlaw Park.\nIn May the City Rovers club wrote a letter to the Board of Control saying that the terrace fence was dangerous. The league responded that they realised this and that work would be undertaken on the fence “as soon as funds permitted”.\nClub flags were discussed at the 26 June meeting and the chairman suggested that a \"flag-pole be erected near the scoreboard … to indicate by the flying of a pennant the team leading during the progress of the main game. Mr Campbell said the idea was one given him by Mr. Horrie Miller. The suggestion was adopted\". Mr Miller was the secretary of New South Wales Rugby League and had recently visited New Zealand. It was decided at the July 3 ARL meeting to address the flagpole next to the score-board proposal next season as the chairman said that it was \"also proposed to improve the present score-board\".\nReferees had money and other items stolen from their dressing rooms during matches at Carlaw Park and at the July 3 ARL meeting it was decided that the issue of unauthorised people gaining \"admittance to the dressing rooms\" needed to be addressed and was referred to a sub-committee for investigation.\nFollowing the North Island v South Island match on August 17 the ARL reported that the takings for club matches at Carlaw Park were \"just over £500 better than those in 1934\" and that \"during the past ten weeks heavy rain had fallen each Saturday, otherwise the figures would have been even more satisfactory\".\nJersey Colours.\nAfter several issues in junior matches where both teams wore uniforms of a similar nature confusing players, the referee, and spectators alike the league decided to form a 'colours committee' to look into the matter. Mr. D. Wilkie said \"after full deliberation … it was suggested that the Otahuhu club's jerseys be taken over and an alteration be made to Glenora jerseys. It was agreed that Ponsonby should retain their present colours. In connection with the clash of colours between City Rovers and Ellerslie, the former club had decided to differentiate by equipping their teams with white shorts\". Otahuhu would be \"suitably recompensed\" for their forced change. The committee also thought that they should compile a register with all the details regarding colours and width of bands on jerseys and other particulars. Their recommendations were adopted and the colours committee were given authority to file patterns from jersey manufacturers in the register for reference. They then examined samples of the new Auckland representative jerseys and deferred their decision on them. At the June 19 board meeting Green Lane's uniform colours were registered as emerald green, black, and white.\nPlayer losses to English professional teams.\nIn the off-season Newton Rangers lost the services of Mortimer Stephens and Cyril Blacklaws who were signed by St Helens. Stephens was from South Auckland and had originally played rugby league for Papakura. He represented Auckland and the North Island side in 1934. Blacklaws had also started his rugby league at Papakura before joining Newton. They both spent some time at St Helens before later signing for Rochdale Hornets. Later Mortimer Stephens son Owen became a representative rugby player, playing for the All Blacks, and the Wallabies, before switching to rugby league and playing for Parramatta and Wakefield Trinity in the 1970s.\nBert Cooke's retirement.\nAt a social evening in Masterton on July 24 Bert Cooke had intimated that this season would be his last. He said that beyond the season he would \"probably be wandering about in plus fours, carrying a bag of golf clubs\". It was later confirmed that he had indeed retired after he made a statement at a dinner for the touring Australian players in October that he had played his last game. This finished a remarkable career where he represented the Auckland rugby side from 1923 to 1925, Hawke's Bay in 1926, and 1931–32, Wairarapa 1927–29, and Wellington in 1930. He made 44 appearances for the All Blacks including 8 tests, scoring 39 tries (4 in tests), and 123 total points. After his switch to rugby league in 1932 he played 46 matches for Richmond Rovers scoring 71 points. His league representative appearances included 11 matches for Auckland, 3 for the North Island, and 5 for New Zealand. He was regarded as one of the most outstanding players of his era.\nObituaries.\nJames Carlaw\nOn May 22, 1935 James Carlaw died at his home in Mt Eden aged 81. Originally from Newcastle-on-Tyne, he was one of the founders of rugby league in Auckland where he had lived since 1863 after arriving from England on board the William Miles with the Albertland settlers. He was made the waterworks engineer for Auckland in 1900 and played a major part in the scheme to obtain a water supply from the Waitakere Ranges in the same year. He was then involved in the plan to build Waitakere Dam which was adopted by the City Council and completed in 1906. He retired in 1925 after years working for the City Council.\nHis name would also be forever etched on the sport of rugby league in Auckland. He was heavily involved in the securing of the land which was later named after him, Carlaw Park, and in its development as the headquarters of rugby league in Auckland. Carlaw was chairman of Auckland Rugby League from 1918 to 1920 and it took 3 years of negotiating by the board he led and the Auckland Hospital Board who owned the land before Carlaw Park was eventually developed and opened on June 21, 1921. Carlaw was also a founding member of Ponsonby United in 1908. He was president of New Zealand Rugby League between 1914 and 1919, and again from 1926 to 1928. In 1928 he was elected Auckland Rugby League president and served in that role until 3 years prior to his death. He was also well involved in the pioneers of the sport of bowls in Auckland and was the champion of the Auckland Club in the 1896–97 season, and president in 1911–12. He left a wife and “an adult family of a former marriage – Mr. John Carlaw, and three daughters, Mesdames A.E. Wetherilt, J.L. Foster and R.G. Sloman” along with ten grandchildren and one great-grandchild. Chairman of Auckland Rugby League, Mr. G. Grey Campbell said of Carlaw “I think it will be generally conceded that few men have been able and willing to give to a sport more than Mr. James Carlaw gave to Auckland… his many activities in sport does not need recounting, because Carlaw Park will ever remain as a living monument to his foresight and accomplishment”. He was buried at Waikumete Cemetery at a largely attended funeral. As a mark of respect players and officials in all grades wore arm bands as a tribute to him on May 25 with the flag on the pavilion flown at half-mast.\nA. (Sandy) Freeman\nSandy Freeman died in September. He was involved in Auckland rugby league from its early days and was an associate of James Carlaw. He was a referee for some time and later a member of the appointments board of the Auckland Referees’ Association of which he became a life member.\nSenior A competitions.\nFox Memorial results.\nRound 1.\nThe first round saw Mount Albert play in their first ever Senior A grade match, a 13–8 win over City Rovers. They had 4 players playing in their first ever game of competitive league after switching codes. Des Herring dislocated his shoulder in the first half while playing for Mt Albert. Lou Brown had returned from England and turned out for City. Wilfred Brimble joined his brother Ted in the Newton side after joining from the Manukau 3rd grade intermediate side. He impressed on his senior debut with his older brother who was in his seventh season with Newton seniors. Noel Bickerton was on debut for the Richmond seniors and scored a try. He went on to become the 249th Kiwi after spending several years in their junior ranks. He was the great-great-grandson of Pōtatau Te Wherowhero, the first Māori king.\nRound 2.\nThe match between Richmond and Mt Albert was played on Kings Birthday (Monday) as part of the silver jubilee celebrations before a crowd of 10,000.\nRound 3.\nQuirke for Newton was sent off for striking an opponent though avoided suspension due to his previous good record.\nRound 4.\nIn the match between Newton and Devonport, R Kelsall (Newton) and John Donald (Devonport) were sent off in the second half and were each suspended for one match.\nRound 5.\nPlayers in all matches wore arm bands as a mark of respect to James Carlaw, who had died that week. Newton applied for a replay after their match with Ponsonby on the grounds that the referee had altered his decision which enabled Ponsonby to win. The league however decided that the result stood.\nRound 6.\nJim Laird, the Marist captain received a bad eye injury requiring several stitches to close the wound in their 27–5 loss to Newton.\nRound 7.\nBrian Connolly had to go to hospital after being injured in the Marist – Mount Albert match. Marist used an unusual scrum formation with 2 players in the front row and 3 in the second row with Jim Laird, their captain playing as a rover in the backs. This was partly due to his eye injury sustained the previous week but the tactic was being used in competitions elsewhere and was experimented with in the ARL this season. The referees held a meeting on June 10 to discuss the tactic. The chairman suggested that \"although there was nothing in the rules covering the point, the Auckland League be asked to insist that the orthodox scrum formation, 3-2-1, be adhered to\". However others including Mr Hill and Mr Stuart Billman believed that experiments by clubs should be encouraged to improve scrums and hooking.\nRound 9.\nThe Governor General, Lord Galway was a guest at the matches at Carlaw Park where the new grandstand had been opened.\nRound 10.\nDuring Richmond's match Bert Cooke broke his nose in the second half. After receiving treatment from St John's he insisted on returning to the play, “and saw out the game in good style”.\nRound 11.\nBert Payne (Ponsonby), and E McNeil (Richmond) were sent off in their match and suspended for one week.\nRound 12.\nNewton and Ponsonby met in the first ever senior A match at Glen Eden. Newton won 14 to 13.\nRound 13.\nThe match between Mount Albert and Marist saw a large amount of fighting with 4 players sent off in the second half (Des Herring and Wilf Hassan for Mount Albert, and Herb Carter and Huck Flanagan for Marist). Herring and Carter were suspended for a match and Hassan and Flanagan were “severely reprimanded”.\nFriendly Matches.\nPrior to the commencement of the Roope Rooster a unique weekend of matches took place. Ponsonby and Otahuhu took on each other on the #1 field at Carlaw Park, however at 1:30 Devonport played Marist and City played Newton. At halftime in the respective matches the leading teams continued play on the #1 field while the trailing teams played against each other on the #2 field.\nPonsonby v Otahuhu.\nScoring was barely reported for any of the matches but it was noted that Roy Bright scored several tries for Ponsonby.\nRoope Rooster.\nRound 1.\nThe match between Mount Albert and Marist was once again marred by rough play and H Shadbolt was sent off after a fight broke out at a scrum. He was suspended for the remainder of the season.\nFinal.\nAuckland were on tour and as a result Richmond were missing Bert Cooke, Eric Fletcher, Cliff Satherley, and Bill Telford, while Claude Dempsey and Ted Brimble were absent for Newton.\nPhelan Shield.\nFinal.\nFor Ponsonby, recent transfer from the Ponsonby Rugby Club, Bella Johnson scored 2 tries. He had been a prop and later returned to the Ponsonby rugby side. Ken Carter had also come across to league from the same side and scored 2 tries for Mount Albert.\nStormont Shield.\nAustralian actress Nellie Bramley kicked off the main game and then was carried off the field by Maurice Quirke and Stan Prentice. Flags were flown at half-mast due to the death of Mr. A (Sandy) Freeman, an old Auckland official and life member of the Auckland Referees Association.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nThe point scoring lists are compiled from matches played in the Fox Memorial, Roope Rooster, Phelan Shield, and Stormont Shield. Competitions which involved all first grade sides\nOther senior club matches.\nNewton v Whangarei.\nNewton travelled to Whangarei to mark the opening of Jubilee Park. A large crowd was in attendance with Mayor Mr. W. Jones expressing pleasure at the league taking over “such a splendid piece of ground”.\nTaupiri v Mount Albert.\nMount Albert travelled to Taupiri to play their senior side. Both teams were missing many of their best players and Taupiri ran out 11–6 winners. William Tittleton scored for Taupiri. His brothers George and Walter played for Taupiri but did not appear in this match. Both played for New Zealand and transferred to join the Richmond club in 1936. Basil Cranch scored for Mt Albert. His younger brother Ray Cranch, debuted for Mt Albert in the mid-1940s and went on to play for New Zealand and has had the Senior B competition trophy named after him.\nWhangarei v City.\nOn July 13 the City Rovers traveled to Whangārei to play the Whangārei side. The team was photographed at Jubilee Park. Eugene Donovan is 2nd player from the right in the front row. Ernie Asher is standing, 2nd from the right, with Lou Brown to his left, and Puti Tipene Watene 3rd player from the right in back row.\nTaradale v Mount Albert.\nMount Albert travelled to the Hawke's Bay to play Taradale who had won the competition there. Mount Albert won the match 22–13 after a \"fine exhibition for the 1.X.L. Cup\". Gunning, a Mount Albert forward had to stay in Napier after breaking his collarbone.\nHuntly v Richmond.\nOn June 3 Richmond had the bye in the Fox Memorial competition so they travelled to Huntly to take on the local senior side. They ran out winners by 19 points to 0. In the evening a dance was held in their honour at the Parish Hall, Huntly with music supplied by Peden's Orchestra. Mr W.C. Davies spoke as the local club patron with Mr Redwood, the Richmond manager replying along with Bert Cooke.\nSenior reserve competitions.\nNorton Cup (senior reserve championship).\nIn Round 8 Devonport was unable to fulfil their fixture with Marist and asked for the opportunity to play it at a later date which was declined due to their being no time to do so. In Round 9 City protested their 5–5 draw with Devonport on the grounds that the referee called the game off at 3pm which meant that the second half was played short. The matter was referred to the Referee's Association for report. At the conclusion of the round robin the top 4 teams played off for the title. In the match between City and Richmond the crowd encroached on the field 3 times halting play. City's win meant that Marist would have to playoff for the title with Richmond. Marist won the title with a 3–0 win in the final.\nStandings.\nA number of match results were not published in any of the newspapers so complete win loss records and points for and against are not available. E Johnson coached the Devonport team.\nStallard Cup (reserve and senior B knockout).\nThe decision was made for the Stallard Cup to have senior reserve teams competing with the senior B sides. In round 1 Papakura recorded a win over the Mount Albert reserves despite playing much of the second half short after Smith left the field injured and Len Taylor later left with concussion. Marist Reserves won the competition defeating City Reserves in the final 16–3 with the match played as the curtain-raiser to the first test between New Zealand and Australia.\nSenior B (Sharman Cup).\nOtahuhu won the Sharman Cup when they won the Senior B championship competition and were congratulated on it at the junior management committee meeting on 9 July by chairman Mr. D. Wilkie.\nSenior B knockout (Walmesley Colts Shield).\nGreen Lane's newly formed senior team was added to the Senior B ‘knockout’ competition which was a ‘knockout’ competition in name only. It was in fact played over 5 rounds with Papakura winning it. The New Zealand Herald stated that they won it with 51 points for and 8 against though this did not line up with the reported scores. Otahuhu were second, Point Chevalier, Green Lane and Waiuku trailing.\nFoster Shield.\nAfter their August 10 match Green Lane protested the result on the grounds that the referee had blown for full time early. It was later decided that the match would be replayed if it would have any bearing on the championship. After Waiuku's match with Point Chevalier their bus was involved in a collision with a car. The rear axel was broken though nobody was injured.\nOther club matches and junior grades.\nJunior grade competitions.\nNominations were received at the beginning of the season for 8 senior grade sides, 16 for the third grade (to be split into two sections), 11 fourth grade sides, 10 fifth grade sides, 8 sixth grade sides, and 4 seventh grade sides. There were weighing in committees formed at Papakura and Otahuhu while weighing in began nightly in late April at the League rooms in Courthouse Lane.\nRichmond once again won the Davis Points Shield for being the most successful junior club in Auckland. They continued their dominance of this trophy.\n2nd Grade (Hayward Shield).\nRichmond Rovers won the championship by 5 points over Ponsonby. Their 7–4 defeat of Ponsonby in the second to last round sealed the title. Richmond also won the knockout competition when they beat RV by 13 points to 6. In the semi finals Richmond defeated Ponsonby 20-2 while RV defeated a Mangere team which had only entered the grade in the knockout competition. Ponsonby beat them 8–0.\n3rd Grade (Walker Cup).\nPonsonby won the 3rd Grade championship (Walker Cup) and the Murray Cup for winning the knockout competition. A. Britton of Ellerslie was named the most sportsmanlike player. The competition was divided into sections though aside from the opening round draw it was unclear which teams were in which section and they all played one another anyway. Ponsonby won section A and City won section B. On July 27 they met in the championship final with the match drawn 11-11. A week later in the final replay Ponsonby won 15–12. Then however, on September 21 they met again in a match advertised as the championship final with Ponsonby winning 19–13. The game was a curtain-raiser to the Auckland v Australia match. Ponsonby won the knockout competition with a 16–10 win over Ōtāhuhu in the final. Glen Ora initially entered a side but ultimately took no part. Akarana B withdrew after 7 weeks, while Manukau A withdrew after 8, then Marist B pulled out of the competition after 12 weeks, and then Northcote followed towards the end of the season after their 15th week.\n4th Grade (Hospital Cup).\n Glenora won the 4th Grade championship, taking out the Hospital Cup, they tied with Newton in the knockout competition for the Kiwi Shield. There were many matches with no scores reported so the below standings are somewhat incomplete. The Glenora side which won the championship in their team photo showed a 20 played, 16 win, 2 draw, 2 loss record which also included 6 knockout matches (the first of which was lost). Glenora beat Newton 25–10 in the preliminary knockout semi final, with Newton then beating City a week later in the next semi final. In the final Glenora and Newton drew 3–3 with 10 minutes extra time played but with no additional scoring so the title was shared. On June 22 the Northcote side was listed in the newspaper as Northcote High School though this was most likely in error as the team regularly played at the Northcote High School but as the sport of rugby league was not played in high schools for many years it is unlikely it was an actual official school side.\n5th Grade (Endean Shield).\nRichmond A won the Endean Shield when they took out the 5th Grade championship and they followed it up with a win in the knockout competition to claim the Milicich Cup. Their final win came over Ellerslie by 7 points to 2 on September 7. Richmond A had beaten Richmond B 29–0 in one semi final while Ellerslie had beaten Akarana 11–0 in the other semi final. A handful of matches did not have the scores reported so the for and against records are incomplete, especially in the case of Devonport who did not have 6 scores reported.\n6th Grade (Rhodes Shield).\nRichmond won the 6th grade championship for the Rhodes Shield and completed the double by taking out the Hammill Cup awarded to the winners of the knockout competition. Point Chevalier withdrew after 9 rounds while Marist initially entered a team but withdrew in the early weeks of the competition possibly not having played a game. There were 8 games without results reported so the scoring is incomplete.\n7th Grade (Myers Cup).\nRichmond won the 7th Grade championship for the Myers Cup. They also won the Oval Shield for the knockout competition (played over 3 weeks) and the Walmsley Miniature Shield for winning the special round which was also played over 3 weeks. In the Oval Shield they beat Avondale 58-0 and City 17–0, while in the Walmsley Miniature Shield they beat Avondale 6-3 and City 5–0. Initially Ellerslie entered a side but they lost in week 1 by 17 points to 2 to City Rovers and after being listed to play Avondale in week 2 they withdrew from the competition.\nSchoolboys (Newport Shield).\nRichmond again were successful in the schoolboys grade winning the Newport Shield when they took out the championship. Devonport won the Eccles Memorial Shield by finishing runners-up. Devonport also won the knockout competition with the Ernest Davis Cup awarded as the prize when they beat Green Lane A in the final on October 12. The Avondale Convent team represented the school at the present day location of St Mary's Catholic School in Avondale. The Devonport team was coached by former senior player Matt Scott.\nRichmond also won the Walmsley Midget Shield, with the best uniformed team being named as Richmond who won the E. Bennett Cup. \n7-a-side (Robert Reid Memorial Shield).\nMarist won the Robert Reid Memorial Shield for winning the seven-a-side competition with the runners-up being Richmond. There were typically 2-3 matches played each weekend at Carlaw Park between the 1st grade matches or at halftime. Due to their short nature the majority of the matches only featured 1 or 2 tries with several games ending 0-0.\nAuckland representative season.\nMessrs. Ernie Asher, Bert Avery, and William Mincham were re-elected as Auckland selectors for the season. Archie Ferguson, and William Liversidge had also been nominated. There had been some debate around the number and makeup of the selectors. Richmond Rovers had been in favour of just one selector along with one other club, though 5 clubs favoured 3 selectors. Newton Rangers provided a letter suggesting that “no nominee be a member of clubs or of the management committee”. Jim Rukutai said that “only the most suitable men should be considered, irrespective of club interests” with William Mincham in support.\nThe season began with two matches at Carlaw Park with Auckland B taking on South Auckland in the curtain-raiser and Auckland A playing Taranaki. The matches were played to assist the selectors in choosing the North Island side for their annual match with the South Island.\nDuring the representative season it was decided to go on a southern tour. The team group of players they selected for the tour were:- Backs – Claude Dempsey (Newton), Bert Cooke (Richmond), Lou Brown (City), Cliff Hall (Devonport), Arthur Kay (Ponsonby), Brian Riley (Ponsonby), Wilf Hassan (Mount Albert), Eric Fletcher (Richmond), and Ted Brimble (Newton), Forwards – Jim Laird (Marist), Lou Hutt (Ponsonby), Hugh Simpson (Devonport), Des Herring (Mount Albert), Cliff Satherley (Richmond), Harold Tetley (Richmond), Dan Keane (Marist). The team selected was not the best available as the better players were kept in Auckland to continue training for their match against the touring Australian side. Chairman C. Grey Campbell acted as manager and Thomas McClymont as coach.\nLate in the season Auckland selected a schoolboys representative team to play a Northland side. Auckland won the Golden Bloom banner by winning the match. Auckland was coached by Lou Brown who presented his English test jersey, acquired whilst playing for New Zealand to the player of the day, which was R. Bradley of the Richmond club.\nFixtures.\nAuckland A v Taranaki.\nBert Cooke had been originally selected to play but injured his shoulder so was replaced in the side. Taranaki put on a good display in the first half and only trailed by a point at the break before Auckland A ran away with the match.\nInter-Island match (Courtney Silver Football Trophy).\nThis was the 10th inter-island match stretching back to 1925. The North Island had won 7, the South Island had won 1 in 1929, with a draw in 1930. Roy Bright, Wilf Hassan and McNeil (Richmond) were selected to play for the North Island but were unavailable. The North Island had 3 players debuting, Bill Telford, Ted Mincham, and W. Large (Hawke's Bay).\nAuckland A v Auckland B (Auckland Trial).\nIn the second half A.S. O’Connor of Wellington replaced Frank Halloran. This had been arranged prior to the match as the selectors wanted to look at players in view of the upcoming Australian visit. A.S. O’Connor was a former Canterbury player who had recently moved to Wellington.\nWellington v Auckland (Southern tour match).\nFormer All Black Herbert Lilburne had switched codes and played for Wellington.\nWest Coast v Auckland (Southern tour match).\nLou Brown played spectacularly for Auckland, scoring 4 tries. Late in the first half Ted Brimble injured his leg and had to go off. Claude Dempsey came on to fullback with the backline reshuffled so Brian Riley could go into the five eighths. John Anderson who would later move to Auckland and become one of the most successful goal kickers in the competition was injured in a club match days earlier and was unable to play for the West Coast. The crowd of 2,000 was particularly impressive for a 3pm kickoff on a weekday in a relatively sparsely populated region.\nCanterbury v Auckland (Southern tour match).\nCliff Hall got injured in the first half and was replaced by Ted Brimble, while Dan Keane replaced Jim Laird. Brimble had been injured in the previous match and was again injured during play in the match with Canterbury but after going off he was able to return to the field. For Canterbury Leonard Stuart came on to replace Leslie Wehner who was injured also.\nAuckland v Australia (Australian tour match).\nAustralian legend Dave Brown who was renowned for his point scoring feats and was referred to as \"the Bradman of league\" scored 10 of Australia's 16 points. This was the first match Australia had played in New Zealand since their 1919 tour.\nTāmaki (Auckland Māori) representative team.\nThe New Zealand Māori Advisory Board was granted the use of Carlaw Park on July 31 for the first Waitangi Shield challenge match of the season between Auckland Māori and Taranaki Māori. The following players were selected to practice at Carlaw Park on Wednesday the 24th of July for the match against Taranaki Māori for the Waitangi Shield: A. Nathan, P. Nathan, D. Nathan, A. Kelsall, Skelton, Steve Watene, E. Kirkwood, A. Wharepouri, D. Hapi, Joseph Hapi, Ratu, Hira, Lou Brown, Bill Turei, W Murray, C. Faulkner, P. Kauhoa, P. Awhitu, W. Rangi, J. Stanaway, K. Tarawhiti, and P. Tepana. The match played on July 31 ultimately turned out to be Takahiwai, representing Northland Māori in their first ever representative match. Tāmaki held on to the Waitangi Shield with a comfortable 24–8 win with New Zealand international Lou Brown scoring 2 tries. They played further matches against Hawke's Bay Māori, and Waikato Māori. They won both matches to retain the Shield.\nFixtures.\n(Waitangi Shield) Tāmaki v Hawke's Bay Māori.\nThe Hawke's Bay team was described as being very heavy with an average weight of 11st 10lb in the backs and 13st, 10lb in the forwards. The Hawke's Bay forwards dominated the play, although Tāmaki's Steve Watene was described as the best forward on the field. It was the brilliance of the Tāmaki backs which saw them win an entertaining match 27–25 with Lou Brown playing in the centres scoring 2 tries and setting up 2 others. Hapi who was a former Hawke's Bay rugby representative also played well for Tāmaki on the wing.\n(Waitangi Shield) Tāmaki v Waikato Māori.\nNoel Bickerton was unavailable due to injury, as was Steve Watene, however the Tāmaki team lost 2 players to injury during the match and Steve Watene had to come on to play. With the scores tied 8-8 he scored what proved to be the match winning try in the corner. In the evening both teams were entertained at the Prince Arthur Hotel.\nAnnual general meetings, club news, and senior registrations and transfers.\nSenior grade registrations and transfers.\nWilf Hassan transferred from Marist Old Boys to Mt Albert United on May 1 after his suspension had been uplifted, as did P.

GolfPass has said that \"You could make an argument that Old Tom Morris is the greatest golf course architect who ever lived\".\nCareer.\nMorris started designing golf courses whilst working at Carnoustie, when he was employed as an apprentice to Allan Robertson. Many of the courses that he subsequently designed have since been remodelled, but not all of them. In 1850, Allan Robertson initially designed the Carnoustie Golf Links, Old Tom Morris remodelled and extended it to a full 18 holes in the early 1870s. Carnoustie's only surviving Morris hole is the par 5 6th hole, previously known as \"Long\", it was officially renamed on 24 September 2003 as \"Hogan’s Alley\" by the 1999 Open Championship winner at Carnoustie Paul Lawrie in honour of Ben Hogan's victory at the same course in The Open in 1953.\nHe also laid out The Himalayas, 9-hole putting course in St Andrews in 1867 for the St Andrews Ladies Golf Club. It lies next to the Old Course, north of the Swilcan Burn. It is thought that it was the first minigolf or 'miniature links' course in the world, and it's now both a 9-hole and 18-hole putting course.\nMorris introduced many of the greenskeeping techniques that are still used today, including:"

        "text": "The Jamestown Jimmies were a minor league baseball team based in Jamestown, North Dakota. Earlier Jamestown teams played as members of the Class D level Dakota League in 1922 and North Dakota League in 1923, with the Jimmies playing as members of the Northern League in 1936 and 1937. The 1936 Jamestown Jimmies were a St. Louis Cardinals minor league affiliate and won the league pennant. The Jimmies hosted minor league home games at City Park, after the \"Jimkotans\" and \"Jimkotas\" played at McElroy Park, in the same location.\nHistory.\nMinor league baseball began in Jamestown, North Dakota in 1922. The 1922 Jamestown Jimkotans became members of the eight–team Class D level Dakota League, replacing the Huron Packers franchise in the league. H.E. Ross established the Jamestown Jinkotas. The Jamestown newspaper held a naming contest and \"Jimkotans\" beat out \"Fort Sewards\" by five votes. Funds were raised for a grandstand for the ballpark.\nThe Jamestown Jimkotans ended their first season of minor league play with a record of 46–51, placing fifth in the Dakota League standings. Wib Smith was the Jamestown manager, as the Jimkotans finished 14.0 games behind the first place Mitchell Kernels in the final standings. Mark Koenig played for Jamestown in 1922 at age 17, hitting .253. His manager, Wib Smith had made the major leagues at the age of 17 with the St. Louis Browns and was important to Koenig's development. Koenig would eventually become a member of the New York Yankees' famed 1927 Murderers' Row lineup, where he hit second in the Yankees' lineup, directly in front of Babe Ruth.\nThe franchise continued play in 1923, joining a new league. To minimize travel, the Dakota League was divided into the South Dakota League and the North Dakota League in 1923 and each played with four teams, with the North Dakota League maintaining Class D Status. The Jamestown Jimkotas played as members of the 1923 North Dakota League, with Logan Powell of Jamestown serving as the North Dakota League president. The Jimkotas ended the season with a record of 32–35, placing second, finishing 15.0 games behind the first place Minot Magicians. Ed Whiting and Henry Wingfield served as managers, as Wingfield hit .402 to lead the North Dakota League in batting average. The North Dakota League permanently folded after the 1923 season ended prematurely in August.\nIn the 1930s, integrated semi–pro baseball thrived in the area and the integrated Jamestown Red Sox team played against other regional teams, with such names as Satchel Paige playing for the local teams.\nIn 1936, minor league baseball returned as the Jamestown Jimmies became members of the Class D level Northern League, playing as a minor league affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals. The \"Jimmies\" moniker originated in Jamestown as the moniker for the local University of Jamestown athletic teams beginning in 1925. The 1936 Jimmies won the Northern League pennant. The team ended the 1936 season with a record of 73–50, placing first in the Northern League regular season under managers John Anderson, Ernie Olson and Rube Foster, finishing 4.0 games ahead of the second place Eau Claire Bears. In the 1936 Northern League playoffs, the Winnipeg Maroons defeated the Jimmies in seven games.\nIn their final season of minor league play, the 1937 Jamestown Jimmies placed fifth in the Northern League final standings. With a record of 49–65, Jamestown finished behind the first place Duluth Dukes, who also had become the league's St. Louis Cardinals affiliate. Edward Kraus served as Jamestown manager in 1937.\nThe Jamestown franchise folded from the Northern League after the completion of the 1937 season. Jamestown, North Dakota has not hosted another minor league team.\nThe ballpark.\nJamestown hosted minor league home games in McElroy Park, which contains Jack Brown Stadium, in 1922 and 1923. The McElroy Park ballpark was built in 1917 and was later renamed. Today, Jack Brown Stadium is home to University of Jamestown and Jamestown High School teams. The address is 1102 3rd Avenue SE, Jamestown, North Dakota.\nIn 1936 and 1937, the Jamestown Jimmies played home games at City Park. City Park and McElroy Park are the same location."

        "title": "Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rugby league",
        "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on the sport of rugby league in both the northern and southern hemispheres with the two major league competitions suspended for periods and numerous other leagues and cup competitions cancelled or abandoned.\nAustralia and New Zealand.\nNRL.\nThe World Health Organization declared the global pandemic on 11 March, the day before the 2020 NRL season was scheduled to start. The first round of games went ahead as scheduled but the pandemic restrictions already had an effect as attendances were lower than anticipated. Between rounds 1 and 2 the New Zealand Government introduced quarantine restrictions which would have meant the New Zealand Warriors having to go into a 14-day quarantine period had they returned home after their round 1 match. Instead the Warriors decide to relocate to Kingscliff, New South Wales and play their round 2 game at the Gold Coast Titans' Cbus Super Stadium instead of their home ground in Auckland. The Warriors will also base themselves in New South Wales for the first three months of 2021.\nRules introduced by the Australian Government limiting gatherings meant that round 2 games were played in empty stadia and on 23 March after round 2 the National Rugby League (NRL) suspended the season. The Australian government allowed the NRL to restart the competition at the end of May with games initially being played behind closed doors at a limited number of venues but later limited crowds were allowed, culminating with over 37,000 being allowed in to watch the Grand Final. With strict bio-security rules introduced in Australia and with the travel restrictions imposed by the New Zealand government the New Zealand Warriors had to base themselves in Australia for the rest of the season. Melbourne Storm were also affected by the COVID-19 situation in Victoria and chose to relocate to the Sunshine Coast, Queensland for the remainder of the season.\nThe NRL introduced rule changes for player welfare, the most significant being the introduction of the \"six again\" or \"six-to-go\" rule for infringements at the ruck by defending teams instead of penalties being awarded. The number of referees per game was reduced from two to one.\nThe length of the regular season was adjusted to 20 games and the J. J. Giltinan Shield was won by Penrith Panthers. The Panthers reached the Grand Final but were defeated in the final by Melbourne Storm.\nState of Origin.\nThe State of Origin series had to be moved from its traditional mid-season slot to November. Queensland won the series 2–1.\nWomen's rugby league.\nThe Women's Premiership took place as scheduled with Brisbane Broncos winning the Grand Final. The State of Origin game was delayed until November and saw Queensland beat New South Wales 24–18.\nFrance.\nOn 13 March 2020, the FFR announced the postponement of all rugby league in the country including the major competitions such as the Elite One Championship, Elite Two Championship, and Lord Derby Cup. Exactly a month later on 13 April, the FFR declared these competitions null and void, with no titles to be awarded. The 2020–21 competitions would go ahead behind closed doors.\nUnited Kingdom.\nSuper League.\n2020 season.\nThe 2020 Super League had already started when the global pandemic was declared with the first six rounds of the competition complete. The first effects were seen in round 7 when Leeds Rhinos refused to travel to Catalans Dragons for a game scheduled for 13 March as one of the Leeds players was displaying symptoms of COVID-19. Three days later the Rugby Football League (RFL) suspended all competition at all levels. The RFL suspension was only planned to last for three weeks with 2 April marked as the date for a return to playing, in the end it was 2 August before the Super League competition resumed. In the interim period Toronto Wolfpack withdrew from the league citing financial pressures. An application to be reinstated into Super League by Toronto was declined leading to a post-season process to decide a 12th Super League club for 2021.\nWhen the season did resume, it was a limited number of grounds and all games were played behind locked gates. The only exception to the latter were three home games played by Catalans in Perpignan where French government COVID-19 regulations allowed crowds up to 5,000 to attend. The time lost and Toronto's withdrawal led to two other significant changes to the season format. Firstly the number of rounds of games was reduced from the planned 29 to 22 and eventually to 20. Secondly league position was decided by win percentage (number of wins divided by number of games played), a format not seen in British rugby league since the 1944–45 Wartime Emergency League.\nFixtures were often postponed and re-arranged at short notice due to the numbers of players and coaching staff testing positive for COVID-19 with teams playing several games at short-notice and/or in a short space of time. When it became apparent that no team was going to fulfil all its fixtures, exemplified by Hull Kingston Rovers announcement at the beginning of November that they would be unable to fulfil their remaining games, the clubs and the RFL agreed to end the season after round 20 and move to the play-offs.\nHaving played 17 games and won 13, Wigan Warriors won the League Leaders Shield. In the play-offs they and close rivals St Helens reached the Grand Final played at the KCOM Stadium, Hull, instead of the regular venue at Old Trafford due to concerns from Manchester United about the event likely needing to be reshedualed, which they could not accommodate. The Grand Final saw St Helens triumphed 8–4 with a try scored after the final hooter had sounded.\nThe RFL adopted the \"six-again\" rule introduced by the NRL and took the additional step of abolishing scrums. Scrums were replaced by a handover of possession and a new set of six tackles.\n2021 season.\nThe 2021 Super League season, which ordinarily would have started in late January, was delayed until March with the hope that the combination of a second full lockdown announced by the UK Government in early January, and start of the UK's COVID-19 vaccination programme would allow for a safer state of play when the league eventually returns. On 11 February it was confirmed that match week one would commence on Friday 26 March, with all fixtures continuing to be played behind closed doors.\nChampionship and League 1.\n2020 season.\nFive rounds of the Championship competition and two rounds of the League 1 competition had been played by 16 March. After consultation with the clubs, both competitions were abandoned and declared \"null and void\" in July.\n2021 season.\nFor the 2021 competitions, the RFL announced that as a precaution against continued COVID-19 disruption both league tables will be based on win percentage.\nChallenge Cup and 1895 Cup.\n2020 season.\nThe Challenge Cup competition had completed the first five rounds before the suspension of the sport in March. In July the clubs met with the RFL and all the non-Super League teams remaining in the competition withdrew. The RFL therefore remade the draw for the sixth and subsequent rounds to only include the 11 remaining Super League sides. The final, which should have been played in July, was eventually played at an empty Wembley Stadium on 17 October and saw Leeds Rhinos beat Salford Red Devils 17–16.\nThe 1895 Cup, the cup competition solely for the Championship and League 1 clubs, was cancelled.\n2021 season.\nFor the 2021 competition, amateur clubs were excluded from the competition in an attempt to make the competition more COVID-19 secure. In addition, due to numerical reasons, only three out of eleven League 1 could participate. Barrow Raiders, Keighley Cougars, and West Wales Raiders would be those teams competing. As a result of the reduced number of teams, the 2021 edition would be six rounds rather than nine.\nDue to non-league team not competing in the tournament, the first two rounds of the competition were made concurrent with the 1895 Cup in an attempt to ease the fixture list. As a result of this, the winners of round 2 of the Challenge Cup would qualify for the semi-finals of the 1985 cup, as well as the last 16 of the Challenge Cup - the stage Super League teams enter.\nThe 2021 Challenge Cup Final was played in front of 40,000 fans, just short of half the capacity Wembley Stadium, as a government large crowd pilot scheme (10,000 fans being the then legal limit outside of pilot schemes).\nWomen's rugby league.\nAll 2020 league competitions were cancelled before any games had been played and the 2020 Challenge Cup competition was abandoned after a single game in the first round had been played.\nAmateur rugby.\nThe 2020 National Conference League season was postponed and later cancelled after two matchweeks.\nInternational rugby league.\n2021 World Cup.\nThe pandemic forced the organisers of the World Cup to develop contingency plans to defer the tournaments to 2022 should it become necessary to postpone in 2021. In July 2021, Australia and New Zealand pulled due to the pandemic aimed concerns around the emergence of the Delta variant in the tournament's hosts country England. Specifically, Australia at the time also had rising COVID-19 cases and a relatively small proportion of the population vaccinated. In contrast, New Zealand was virtually covid free and feared reintroduction following the return of players and fans. On 5 August, the tournament was officially postponed to 2022 due to the withdrawal of Australia and New Zealand.\nContinental Tournaments.\nEurope.\nEuro A was cancelled due to the teams playing in the tournament playing in the delayed World Cup instead. Euro B and D was postponed to 2021, and Euro C postponed to 2022.\nOceania.\nThe Oceania Cup was cancelled.\nMiddle East and Africa.\nThe Middle East-Africa Championship was cancelled.\nAmericas.\nThe Americas Championship was cancelled.\nTours.\nThe planned tour to Great Britain by scheduled for October and November 2020, including the revival of The Ashes, was cancelled."

She competed as the first Singaporean dressage rider at the 2018 World Equestrian Games in Tryon, where she ranked 56th.\nFollowing the withdrawal of New Zealand's rider from the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, a replacement rider was to be chosen from the Dressage Grand Prix held in Le Mans, France. Chew went to the Grand Prix and posted a personal best score of 69.674 and qualified for the Olympics. She is the first Singaporean equestrian athlete to participate at the Olympic Games. However, Chew was eliminated from the Games as her horse Tribiani was found to be bleeding from the mouth, caused by a stumble before the competition.\nPersonal life.\nCaroline Chew studied law at the Bristol University in England.

The event was scheduled to begin on Thursday 4 February at the Motorpoint Arena in Cardiff and end with the play-offs at the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Berlin on Thursday 27 May, but due to the continuation of the COVID-19 outbreak, was delayed to begin with the first nine rounds taking place from 5 April behind closed doors at the Marshall Arena, Milton Keynes. On 22 March 2021, it was then confirmed that all the fixtures would take place in Milton Keynes, with the playoffs taking place on Friday 28 May; up to 1,000 people were allowed to attend from Monday 24 May.\nGlen Durrant was the reigning champion, having beaten Nathan Aspinall 11–8 in the 2020 final, but a run of seven successive defeats saw him eliminated on night seven; Durrant eventually became the first player in Premier League Darts history to fail to score a single point. Rob Cross was also eliminated from the competition for a second consecutive year on the eighth night, despite earning seven points, which is the most by an eliminated player since elimination came into effect in 2013.\nTwo nine-dart finishes were thrown during the tournament. Jonny Clayton threw a nine-darter against José de Sousa on Night Three, and the very next day, de Sousa threw a nine-darter of his own against Nathan Aspinall. He also hit 11 maximum scores of 180 during the match, equalling the Premier League record set by Gary Anderson in 2011. De Sousa threw 96 maximums during the tournament, surpassing Gary Anderson's record of 79.\nFor the first time, the playoffs featured four players from four nations: Michael van Gerwen from the Netherlands, Jose de Sousa from Portugal, Nathan Aspinall from England, and Jonny Clayton from Wales.\nJonny Clayton won his second individual televised title, defeating fellow debutant José de Sousa 11–5 in the final. He became the first Welshman to win the event, the first champion to have finished fourth in the league phase, and the first person to defeat Michael van Gerwen in a Premier League semi-final.\nFormat.\nThe tournament format reverted to that used in 2018, with a permanent list of ten players, instead of nine players and a guest \"challenger\" each week, as had been used in 2019 &amp; 2020.\nPhase 1:\nIn each round, the ten players play each other in five matches. Phase 1 matches have a maximum of twelve legs, allowing for the winner being first to seven or a six-six draw. At the end of Phase 1, the bottom two players are eliminated from the competition.\nPhase 2:\nIn each round, the remaining eight players play each other in four matches. Phase 2 matches have a maximum of fourteen legs, allowing for the winner being first to eight or a seven-seven draw. At the end of Phase 2, the bottom four players in the league table are eliminated from the competition.\nPlay-off Night:\nThe top four players in the league table contest the two knockout semi-finals with 1st playing 4th and 2nd playing 3rd. The semi-finals are first to 10 legs (best of 19). The two winning semi-finalists meet in the final which is first to 11 legs (best of 21).\nVenues.\nThe announced calendar included The Brighton Centre being restored to the calendar, having last hosted the Premier League in 2017. The initial calendar also restored rounds in Birmingham, Belfast, Leeds, Berlin, Rotterdam, Glasgow, Manchester, Newcastle, Sheffield and London; all of which had been scheduled for 2020 but cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic; with Berlin replacing London as the scheduled host of the final. Milton Keynes and Coventry, which hosted rounds in 2020 following the pandemic, were not intended to be on the 2021 calendar. Due to the continuation of the pandemic, the PDC confirmed that the first nine rounds would be held over two weeks at the Marshall Arena, Milton Keynes. On 22 March 2021, it was confirmed that all the remaining dates, including the playoffs, would also be played in Milton Keynes.\nThe first five nights took place from Monday 5 April to Friday 9 April, with the next four nights, including Judgement Night (where the bottom two players are eliminated), taking place from Monday 19 April to Thursday 22 April. The second half will again be in two parts with the first part taking place between Wednesday 5 May to Friday 7 May, and the second part to take place from Monday 24 May to Thursday 27 May, with the playoffs taking place on Friday 28 May.\nPrize money.\nThe prize money for the 2021 tournament was increased from £825,000 to £855,000, due to the additional player compared to 2020.\nPlayers.\nNine of the ten players in this year's tournament were announced following the 2021 PDC World Darts Championship on 3 January. The top four on the PDC Order of Merit are joined by six wildcards. The tenth was announced following the 2021 Masters, with the final of that event serving effectively as a play-off between Mervyn King and Jonny Clayton, with the winner qualifying.\nGerwyn Price, the world number one and reigning world champion, tested positive for COVID-19 before the start of the tournament and had to withdraw. James Wade, the highest-ranked player not in the tournament, was brought in as a replacement.\nPlay-offs – 28 May.\n Marshall Arena, Milton Keynes\nTable and streaks.\nTable.\nAfter the first nine rounds in phase 1, the bottom two players in the table are eliminated. In phase 2, the eight remaining players play in a single match on each of the seven nights. The top four players then compete in the knockout semi-finals and final on the playoff night.\nTwo points are awarded for a win and one point for a draw. When players are tied on points, leg difference is used first as a tie-breaker, after that legs won against throw and then tournament average."

The Aggies represent Utah State University in the NCAA's Mountain West Conference.\nUtah State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1903. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Utah State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

He joined the varsity squad as a sophomore in 1959 and started scoring goals for the Pioneers immediately. He recorded 31 in his first season to lead the team and scored the first goal in Denver's championship victory. Walker became the star of the team the following season when he set numerous program and conference records by scoring 56 goals in 32 games. He was the first player named as the WCHA Most Valuable Player and was first team First Team All-WCHA and an All-American. In the NCAA Tournament Walker was one of the focal points of the offense and led Denver to a second consecutive championship as well as a 30–1–1 record to complete one of the most dominant seasons in NCAA history.\nDespite having a year of eligibility remaining, Walker left Denver after 1961 and played professional and senior hockey for the remainder of the decade before retiring in 1969. He was inducted into the Denver Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999. Walker is still regarded as one of, if not the greatest goal-scorers in the history of the Denver Pioneers. Among the Denver Pioneers records he still holds are goals in a season (56), goals per game (1.32), hat-tricks (13), hat-tricks in one season (10), and he held the record for most goals in a season by any WCHA player until 1986."

        "text": "Robert Dryden (10 January 1918 – 14 March 1996) was a Scotland international rugby union player. He played as a wing.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nDryden played for Watsonians.\nIn a notable game against Kelso the Watsonian wing scored all four tries for his side, \"The Scotsman\" newspaper of 8 February 1937 noting:\nDryden was an outstanding performer , the young Watsonian \"flier\" scoring all his sides four tries, his closing move being the result of a brilliant effort from his own half of the field. It can truly be said that it was Dryden's speed which gave the visitors the substantial victory, the home lot having no one in their ranks to keep in touch with him.\nHe played for Watsonians in the 1939 Melrose Sevens tournament. They were up against Heriots in the first round, with John Craig, Dryden's erstwhile opponent facing up against him. Heriots won through and won the tournament in that year.\nHe was included in the Army team of 1941.\nProvincial career.\nDryden played for Scotland Possibles in January 1937.\nDryden turned out for the Scotland Probables side for the second and final trial match of that season, on 15 January 1938. He was injured after the first ten minutes and was replaced by N.A. Gillanders of Panmure. Dryden sustained a small but deep cut in his head which required a stitch and heavy bandaging.\nHe had several trial matches. His biggest rival for international selection was noted as John Craig from Heriots F.P.\nHe was belatedly called up for East of Scotland District against the West of Scotland District in 1939 when G.H. Caithness called off. Dryden was home on leave at the time. The \"Edinburgh Evening News\" thought that the East's chances relied on Dryden's readiness:\nThe success of the East backs will depend a great deal on whether or not J. R. S. Innes and R. H. Dryden have been getting enough Rugby to \"keep their eye in.\" It is not likely that the Watsonian internationalist has been playing much, for he has been in the Army since the outbreak of war. For some time Dryden has been undergoing a special training course in the South along with W. R. C. Brydon, Heriot’s F.P. The West have got together as powerful a side as possible, and it should be a more interesting game than the Myreside affair.\nDespite his late call-up, Dryden himself had to pull out of selection. His Watsonian team-mate E.C. Hunter stepped in and performed well. The East beat the West by a single point in a 7–6 win.\nHe was due to play for the East of Scotland District against the West of Scotland District in 1942 but was replaced by E.C.K. Douglas in the starting line-up.\nInternational career.\nDryden was capped by Scotland once. He played against England at Murrayfield in 1937.\nHe was called up when Scotland had selection issues at wing."

Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Chattanooga's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

Entering his senior season, Colby joined with 27 other eastern schools to form ECAC Hockey. While the Mules weren't considered a threat by many of the traditional eastern powers, Colby ended up winning the inaugural regular season championship by going 17–1–1 in conference play. The shocking finish earned Stephenson a place on the All-ECAC First Team as well as a nod as an All-American. Colby was seeded third in the ECAC Tournament (seedings were arranged based upon rankings and not conference standings) and they won their opening match against Rensselaer. The team's offense faltered in the semifinal against Clarkson and remained dormant in the third place game, preventing Colby from making an almost unthinkable appearance in the NCAA Tournament."

The match due on 18 December 1937 was called off due to frost despite the contingency of straw being placed on The Greenyards pitch at Melrose. When the second trial match went ahead in January 1938 as planned, Inglis was not picked - due to injury - either for the Probables side or the Scotland Possibles side. Inglis place in the Probables side was taken by W. F. Blackadder, who was due to play in the Possibles side instead. It was noted that Inglis had sprained his ankle on a holiday to Switzerland a fortnight before the trial.\nIndeed, it was noted that Inglis received his first call-up to the Scotland side without playing a match in Scotland; either for a club side or a district or trial side. He was scheduled to play in a trial side two years before but a torn muscle hindered this; and he was not even able to play in Scotland with Cambridge University when they played Scottish teams on tour.\nHe finally managed to play for Scotland Probables in January 1939, then playing club rugby for London Scottish. However G.D. Shaw eclipsed Inglis's performance and Inglis received no more Scotland caps.\nInternational career.\nInglis was capped by Scotland 6 times, all in the period between 1937 and 1938.\nMilitary career.\nInglis was a Lieutenant in the Royal Engineers.\nDeath.\nHe died at his home on 22 April 1988 in the Sunnyside district of Wimbledon in London."

        "text": "The 2019–20 Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) men's basketball season began with practices in October 2019, followed by the start of the 2019–20 NCAA Division I men's basketball season on November 1. Conference play started in January and concluded March 11, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This season was the 39th season of MAAC basketball.\nIn a most unpredictable season, all 11 teams had an equal shot at being the top team in the MAAC, but at the end, only one could emerge. The regular season crown came down to the final day. Siena, picked sixth, controlled their own destiny, beat Monmouth and clinched their first outright MAAC regular season championship in almost a decade. Siena would put the game away early and cruise to an 86–72 victory, clinching the MAAC regular season championship and the #1 seed in the 2020 MAAC tournament. Upstart Saint Peter's, picked ninth, would finish one game behind Siena, so close to their first conference championship since 1987. Iona, who was the preseason favorite in the MAAC, was without their coach Tim Cluess, who missed the entire 2019–20 season with an undisclosed illness, and finished in sixth place. It was their lowest finish in the standings since finishing seventh in 2008–2009.\nThe 2020 MAAC tournament was held on March 10 and March 11 at the Jim Whelan Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The 2020 MAAC Basketball Championship moved to the historic Boardwalk Hall for the first time in MAAC history. However, after the two quarterfinal games on March 11, the other two quarterfinal games, semifinals and finals were cancelled amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Siena, who was the #1 seed, and who had won their quarterfinal game, would have been the MAAC's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament should it have been held. On March 12, the tournament, as well as all other NCAA championships for the remainder of the academic season, were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the first time the tournament had been cancelled since its creation in 1939.\nHead Coaches.\nCoaching changes.\nOn March 11, 2019, Fairfield head coach Sydney Johnson was fired. He finished at Fairfield with an eight-year record of 116–147. On April 3, Rutgers assistant Jay Young was announced as Johnson's replacement.\nOn March 11, 2019, Niagara head coach Chris Casey was fired. He finished at Niagara with a six-year record of 64–129. On March 28, 2019, Niagara hired Patrick Beilein as their new head coach. On October 24, it was announced that Beilein would be stepping down from his job, citing personal reasons. That same day, assistant coach Greg Paulus was announced as interim head coach.\nOn March 21, 2019, it was announced that Siena head coach Jamion Christian would be accepting the head coaching position at George Washington. On March 25, it was announced that assistant coach Carmen Maciariello would be named as Christian's successor.\nCoaches.\n\"Notes:\" \nMAAC Regular Season.\nConference Matrix.\nThis table summarizes the final head-to-head results between teams in conference play during the regular season.\nPlayer of the week.\nThroughout the regular season, the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference offices named player(s) of the week and rookie(s) of the week.\nRecords against other conferences.\n2019–20 records against non-conference foes.

It was previously scheduled for 13 to 18 December but moved back three days on 24 February 2021. Originally scheduled to be held in 2020, the championships were pushed back one year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Competition took place in a 25-metre (short course) temporary pool installed at Etihad Arena.\nIn September 2021, it was announced the Championships would be part of a larger aquatics program, called the Abu Dhabi Aquatics Festival, which includes competition in open water swimming, diving, and high diving.\nQualification.\nThe qualification period for competing at the 2021 World Swimming Championships ran from 1 December 2019 through 28 November 2021. On 23 November 2021, FINA announced it would take into consideration times swum as part of the 2021 International Swimming League and allow them to count towards qualification for the 2021 World Championships. In addition to country-specific selection procedures, competitors were required to achieve a qualifying \"A\" or \"B\" time in an event to qualify for the individual or a relay event with individual entries capped at two competitors per country and relay entries capped at one team per country.\nBelow are the qualifying times for the 2021 World Championships as determined by FINA:\nSchedule.\nAn opening ceremony preceded the start of pool swimming competition on 16 December, was followed by competition from 16 December to 21 December, and concluded with a closing ceremony on 21 December.

One of the broadcasting agencies providing coverage of pool swimming competition internationally is the Olympic Channel. Additional international coverage was provided by Eurovision Sports.\nVariations in country representation.\nDue to a multi-year ban of Russian representation at World Championships by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, competitors from the country were not allowed to compete using their flag, anthem, nor country name during competition, instead competing with the name Russian Swimming Federation.\nIssues related to COVID-19.\nOn 14 December 2021, it was announced that South African swimmers residing in South Africa would not be able to compete in the championships, due to travel bans resulting from the prevalence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, which is the World Health Organization's latest “variant of concern.”\nOn 16 December 2021, FINA informed the Singapore Swimming Association that its entire squad will not be able to compete in the championships due to contact tracing protocols, after four of the country's swimmers tested positive for COVID-19 while in Abu Dhabi.\nOn 17 December 2021, FINA confirmed seven accredited participants with positive COVID-19 results, which included at least one administrator from Nigeria, and that in turn knocked out all four of Nigeria's swimmers from the meet. This raised questions about its protocols, as some swimmers from other nations such as Great Britain and the United States were allowed to continue competing despite members of those teams testing positive for COVID-19.\nBy the end of the championships on 21 December 2021, FINA provided a cap number of 40 individuals who tested positive in the duration of the meet. Later the exact number of COVID-19 positive accounts was provided, 37 cases total out of all 5,000 individuals involved with the competition, 15 of which were athlete cases."

After three years as an Elite National team, the team moved up to the UCI Continental level in 2021.\nThe team's name is taken from the Cornish abbot Saint Piran. The team's jersey draws inspiration from the Cornish flag and the Cornish tartan, and is unusual in featuring no sponsors. Alongside its UCI Continental team, Saint Piran also maintains development teams and a women's team."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Commodores represent Vanderbilt University in the NCAA's Southeastern Conference.\nVanderbilt began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1900. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Vanderbilt's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

It was originally scheduled to be held from March 10 through March 14, 2021, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. Due to COVID-19 regulations, the tournament was moved to Richmond, Virginia and was set to be played entirely at the Robins Center and Siegel Center, respectively homes of A-10 members Richmond and VCU.\nThe A-10 later announced that it had swapped the dates of its men's and women's tournaments. The bulk of the men's tournament was now played at the aforementioned Richmond venues from March 3 through 6. The first round and both semifinals were hosted by VCU, while the second round and both quarterfinals were split between both venues. The women's tournament, being held at the Siegel Center, took over the original men's tournament dates. Both tournament finals were held on March 14, with the women's final in Richmond and the men's final at UD Arena in Dayton, Ohio.\nSeeds.\nAll 14 A-10 schools participated in the tournament. Teams were seeded by winning percentage within the conference, with a tiebreaker system to seed teams with identical percentages. Any team that did not play above 60 percent of the median number of conference games played by other members would be seeded by their NET ranking within the conference rather than by winning percentage, but all teams ultimately qualified to be seeded by winning percentage. The top 10 teams received a first-round bye and the top four teams received a double-bye, automatically advancing them to the quarterfinals."

This year's competition will be contested between only the professional clubs.\nThe competition was won by St Helens who beat Castleford 26–12 at Wembley Stadium on 17 July 2021.\nLeeds Rhinos were the defending champions, after defeating Salford Red Devils 17–16 in the 2020 final. However, they were eliminated in round 3, after losing 18–24 to St Helens.\nEntrants.\nUsually the Challenge Cup is contested between the clubs of the professional Super League, Championship, League 1 and a number of invited amateur teams. However this year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the 2021 Challenge Cup did not include the amateur teams. French-side Toulouse Olympique who play in the Championship choose not to play in cup competitions.\nThe matches were broadcast by the BBC with the initial rounds being made available online with matches from the last 16 being broadcast on television following the BBC agreeing a new three year deal with the RFL. The date for the 2021 final was confirmed prior to the 2020 Challenge Cup Final with the hopes that fans will be able to be admitted.\nRounds.\nWhen the details of the competition were announced in December 2020, it was envisaged that the first round, would feature the League 1 clubs; and Dewsbury Rams, Newcastle Thunder, Oldham and Whitehaven from the Championship. The rest of the Championship clubs enter at round two, with the Super League clubs entering in round four.\nIt was also announced, that the early rounds of the competition will also form the early rounds of the 1895 Cup with the highest four teams from the Championship and League 1, becoming the semi-finalists of the 1895 Cup, with the final to be played, on the same day as the Challenge Cup Final at Wembley.\nThe first round draw was due to be held on the week commencing 4 January 2021. However, due to the UK lockdown, this was delayed.\nA further meeting of the clubs was held on 13 January 2021, to discuss alternative schedules for both the cup competitions and the league fixtures, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. \nSeveral contingency plans were announced, which mostly affected the involvement of the League 1 clubs in the Challenge Cup.\nAfter further discussion around option 3, the majority of the League 1 clubs decided not to participate in the competition. Barrow, Keighley and West Wales Raiders, decided to enter, and played in a 16-team round 1 with the 13 participating Championship clubs.\nRound 1 was scheduled for the weekend of 20–21 March.\nAfter the announcement, at least two League 1 clubs, Rochdale and Hunslet, expressed disappointment and claimed that a selection process had taken place rather than all clubs withdrawing.\nAny club unable to fulfil a tie in the first two rounds will forfeit the fixture to their opponents. Ties unable to be played due to a team having seven or more players out due to COVID-19 restrictions, will be re-arranged and will take precedence over league fixtures.\nFirst round.\nThe draw for the first and second rounds of the competition was made on 11 February 2021. The first round games were played over the weekend of 20/21 March 2021.\nDue to COVID-19 regulations prohibiting live attendances all the first round games were broadcast live either on the RFL's \"Our League\" app or on the BBC's \"Red Button\" and \"iPlayer\" services or on \"The Sportsman\" online services.\nSecond round.\nThe second round games took place a week after the first round over the weekend of 27/28 March 2021.

As matches are still to be played behind closed doors, all eight ties will be broadcast live.\nThe match between Castleford and Hull Kingston Rovers became one of the longest games in rugby league. With scores tied at 32-all after 80 minutes, the game went to the fourth period of extra time (each period being 5 minutes) and it was not until the 99th minute that a winning score was made when Gareth O'Brien kicked a drop goal to give Castleford the victory.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe draw was made live on BBC Two, during the half-time interval of the third round match between Catalans Dragons and Wakefield Trinity.

Due to the exceptional circumstances imposed by COVID-19 the RFL made the decision to arrange for every game played behind closed doors to be broadcast live. Normal broadcast partner, the BBC, showed games from rounds one and two via the BBC Sport website or on the BBC Sport app with games from round three were show on terrestrial channels. A new to rugby league broadcaster, The Sportsman's digital services, showed games from all the first three rounds on its website or social media channels. The games that were not picked up by the BBC or The Sportsman's digital services were broadcast by the RFL itself on a pay-per-view basis via the \"Our League\" app. For the quarter-finals, Sky Sports broadcast two of the four matches with the BBC showing the other two. With the semi-final and the final being broadcast on BBC One and Two this was the first staging of the Challenge Cup in which every tie was broadcast live."

        "title": "White House swimming pool",
        "text": "The swimming pool at the White House, the official residence of the president of the United States, is located on the South Lawn near the West Wing.\nHistory and description.\nThe wide and long pool was created in 1975 by Gerald Ford during his presidency. Before becoming president, Ford swam twice daily at his home in Alexandria, Virginia; early in the morning and after work in the evening. Ford regretted the White House no longer had a swimming pool and did not find playing golf as satisfying for exercise as swimming. \"The New York Times\" reported that the pool was built \"over strong opposition from his [Ford's] advisers\" as Ford had stressed budgetary restraint upon taking office in 1974. Aides had reportedly warned Ford that the construction of a pool would ensure that he only lasted a year in the presidency and should wait until after his potentially successful re-election in 1976.\nThe area had previously been part of the South Lawn, with a natural screen of bushes and trees. Ford was a regular swimmer and demonstrated his swimming for the press when the pool was completed. The photographer Dick Swanson of \"People\" took a picture from the bottom of the pool of Ford swimming. In 1933, an indoor swimming pool had been built for President Franklin D. Roosevelt for his physical therapy for polio. The pool was covered over in 1970 when the space was remodeled as the Press Briefing Room.\nA cabana was later added to the pool, with showers and changing facilities, and an underground passage connects the cabana to the West Wing for security. The cabana is solar powered with heated pipes providing hot water with the remaining heat going to the outdoor spa. It was renovated in 2002 with extra windows and a raised roof.\nFord's son, Jack, learned to scuba dive in the pool, and 39th President Jimmy Carter's daughter Amy frequently dived in the pool. Barbara Bush often swam in the pool; in 1990, a rat swam past her and was subsequently drowned by her husband, 41st President George H. W. Bush. Barbara Bush said that she \"[swam] with a mask, and it just went right by in front of me...Fortunately, George Bush was there and drowned the beast. It was horrible\". Hillary Clinton was also a frequent user of the pool. Clinton had considered recreating the indoor pool of the White House and creating a new space for the media. As part of the White House grounds, the pool and its cabana are the responsibility of the National Park Service.\nIn the first year of his presidency, Barack Obama wrote that he would leave the Oval Office and \"have a cigarette (or two)\" by the cabana, \"savoring a quieter moment and letting my thoughts wander and deepen\".\nCost.\nThe cost of the pool was estimated at $52,417 (). It was entirely funded by private contributions, with donations limited to $1,000 (). A swimming pool committee oversaw the construction of the pool; it was chaired by the vice chairman of the United States Olympic swimming committee, A. J. Sehorn."

        "title": "Sawley Cricket Club",
        "text": "Sawley Cricket Club is an amateur cricket club based in Long Eaton, Derbyshire, England. The club has a history dating back to the early 19th century.\nGround.\nThe home ground is located on West Park, Long Eaton, Derbyshire and has access to three pitches. The 1st and 2nd XI teams use the Bill Camm pitch, rated by the Derbyshire County Cricket League as a Grade A+ ground, and the 3rd and 4th XI use the Graham Draycott pitch, rated as a Grade B ground.\nHistory.\nThe earliest known record of cricket associated with the village of Sawley is the announcement of a fixture in the \"Nottingham Review\" dated 15 August 1834 stating \"A Cricket Match between the first eleven of Sawley and Shardlow...\", but the earliest known match report is of a match between Ockbrook and 'Sawley Club', printed in the \"Derby and Chesterfield Reporter\" on the 27th October 1843. Evidence stating when Sawley Cricket Club was formally established is found in the Derbyshire County Cricket League archives, listing Sawley Cricket Club as founded in 1870. The ground at this time, called the ‘Trent Bridge Ground’, was situated behind the 'Harrington Arms' adjacent to the Harrington Bridge on the main road to Birmingham on the River Trent in Sawley. Cricket was played at the ground until the early 1960s, when it was eventually abandoned due to frequent flooding by the nearby River Trent and poor ground conditions.\nIn 1962, Parkside CC was formed and an amalgamation with Sawley CC took place in 1969. Sawley Park, in Sawley, became the new venue in 1965. In 1971, Sawley CC joined the Derbyshire Border League and continued to strive to improve playing standards and win trophies. October 1979 saw the amalgamation with Sawley Nomads CC. The new ground now being used was on West Park, Long Eaton.\nSawley Nomads CC had a history, being formed in 1950 as the Long Eaton County Billiard Hall CC. This name was subsequently changed to Long Eaton Nomads CC and in 1964 to Sawley Nomads CC.\nOne of Sawley's most successful decades in recent times was during the 1990s, when the club won many cup titles and ultimately became Derbyshire County Cricket League Champions in 1997. Two years later, when the top flight division of the Derbyshire County League became an ECB Premier Division, Sawley CC amalgamated with its smaller neighbour Long Eaton Park CC, to become one of the largest clubs in the district. Sawley &amp; Long Eaton Park CC, as it became known, was one of only two clubs in the Derbyshire County Cricket League to field five senior XI teams.\nLong Eaton Park CC started life as Bourne Primitive Methodist CC in 1890, amalgamating with Bethel CC in 1934. Following on from the Second World War, the name was changed to Long Eaton Methodist CC. In the early 1980s, the building of the Graham Draycott pavilion on West Park caused constitutional problems with the Church connection. The club was renamed Long Eaton Park CC to allow the establishment of a bar and to play Sunday cricket. It was during the 1980s that Long Eaton Park CC achieved a Division 7 championship win in 1985, 2 Division 5 wins (1986, 1989) and won the Wright Cup in 1987. As a result of the amalgamation, the club added Long Eaton Park to the club name and acquired the Graham Draycott pavilion. The Sawley CC pavilion (named after Bill Camm, a Sawley councillor, prominent local politician and former president of the club) was refurbished and a scorebox added in 2007. The Graham Draycott Pavilion was extended to provide more changing rooms, for both male and female players.\nIn 2021, after two successful decades of cricket as Sawley &amp; Long Eaton Park CC, the club changed the club name back to Sawley Cricket Club to help reduce confusion with its other neighbour Long Eaton Cricket Club, also based on West Park. As part of the re-brand, the club colours were formally changed from the historical Blue and White to Green and Yellow, in line with the club training kit colours that had been informally adopted by the club for the best part of 30 years.\nThe club currently has four senior teams competing in the Derbyshire County Cricket League and a long established junior training section that play competitive cricket in the Erewash Young Cricketers League.\nClub Performance.\nThe Derbyshire County Cricket League competition results showing the club's positions in the league (by Division) since 2002.\nThe Newark Club Cricket Alliance Sunday League competition results showing the club's position (by Division) since 2015."

The play-off tournament was used as a test event for New Zealand to host prior to the Women's World Cup. It took place from 18 to 23 February 2023, and featured ten teams split into three groups, with the winner of each group qualifying for the Women's World Cup. New Zealand and guests Argentina also played friendlies against participating teams and each other as part of the event.\nFormat.\nOn 24 December 2020, the Bureau of the FIFA Council approved the slot allocation and format of the play-off tournament.\nThe play-off tournament was held in New Zealand as a test event prior to their hosting of 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. It featured ten teams, split into three groups of three (Group A and B) or four (Group C). The winner of each group qualified for the FIFA Women's World Cup. Four teams were seeded into groups based on the FIFA Women's World Rankings. In Groups A and B, two unseeded teams faced each other in a semi-final. The winner of the semi-final advanced to the play-off final, playing against the seeded team for a spot in the Women's World Cup. In Group C, the two seeded teams faced an unseeded team in the semi-finals. The winners of the semi-finals faced each other in the play-off final for a spot in the Women's World Cup.\nNew Zealand and Argentina (confirmed as guests on 8 December 2022) participated in friendly matches as part of the event, first against one of the seeded teams in Groups A and B, and then twice against each other. Friendly matches also took place between the semi-final loser of Groups A and B, as well as the two semi-final losers of Group C, thereby ensuring that all play-off teams played two matches at the event.\nNew Zealand were confirmed as the sole host nation for the play-off tournament on 4 July 2022.

Four teams were seeded into groups based on the FIFA Women's World Rankings of 13 October 2022 (shown in parentheses), with a maximum of one seeded team per confederation. The UEFA team was automatically seeded into pot 1, so as to prevent three European teams from being drawn into the same group in the final tournament. The highest-ranked team was placed in slot A1, the second-highest in slot B1, the third-highest in slot C1 and the fourth-highest in slot C2. The remaining six teams were unseeded and drawn into the remaining slots, with the condition that teams from the same confederation could not be drawn into the same group. In the draw, the six unseeded teams were allocated to the first available group sequentially (from A to C, before repeating). After a team was selected, a separate draw then determined the team's position within their respective group for the purposes of the schedule.\nSquads.\nEach team had to provide to FIFA a preliminary squad of between 35 and 55 players, which was not to be published. From the preliminary squad, each team had to name a final squad of up to 23 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers). Players in the final squad could be replaced due to serious injury or illness up to 24 hours prior to the team's first match.\nSchedule.\nThe match schedule and venues, without kick-off times, were confirmed on 4 July 2022.

This will be the first Asian Games held in Saudi Arabia, as well as the third and the last of two consecutive Asian Games held in Arabian Peninsula as the previous edition is set to be held in Doha, Qatar.\nBidding process.\nAn Olympic Council of Asia's (OCA) Evaluation Committee led by Andrey Krukov from Kazakhstan inspected the candidate cities of Doha and Riyadh. The OCA voted on 16 December 2020 at the 39th OCA General Assembly in Muscat, Oman to select the host city for the 2030 Asian Games. The OCA confirmed on 23 April 2020, that the Saudi Arabian Olympic Committee had submitted the bid documents and the letters of support from the Government of Saudi Arabia to host the Games in Riyadh. On 15 December 2020, OCA President Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah announced that he would attempt to find a dual-host city solution to avoid a vote for the 2030 Asian Games, by persuading one city to host the event in 2030 and the other to organize the competition in 2034. On 16 December 2020, it was announced that Doha will host 2030 Games with the highest votes and Riyadh will host the 2034 Games. Saudi Arabia had asked the OCA to halt electronic voting on the host of the 2030 Asian Games due to \"the possibility of technical fraud\"."

His main position is centre.\nEarly life.\nButler started playing rugby aged seven at Ledbury RFC and stayed with them through to Under 17 level, representing Herefordshire, North Midlands and England Lions Under 16s along the way. Butler joined the Worcester Warriors set-up aged 14 and made his way up the age-groups, helping the Under 18s to Finals Day success both in 2016 and 2017, as they beat both Exeter Chiefs and Saracens.\nClub career.\nWill Butler came through the Warriors junior academy before joining the senior academy in the summer of 2016. In his first season at Sixways, Butler was a regular for Worcester Cavaliers and was handed his first-team debut in a European Rugby Challenge Cup clash in Moscow against Enisei-STM. An injury sustained during the game in Russia kept him out for most of the season.\nOn 20 December 2018, Butler signed a two-year professional contract to stay with Worcester, thus promoted to the senior squad from the 2019–20 season.\nAn elbow injury, sustained in the Premiership Rugby Sevens Series in August 2018, further disrupted Butler's progress but he returned to action in December and impressed for Cavaliers, who he captained in the Premiership Rugby Shield. Butler suffered a further setback when he sustained an ankle injury on his seasonal debut at Bath in September 2019 and was ruled out for four months. He returned to action against Enisei-STM in the European Challenge Cup in January 2020 as a second-half replacement and marked his return with a try.\nHe was appointed Warriors Assistant Club Captain in July 2020. Butler led Worcester in away Premiership matches against Wasps and Exeter Chiefs in August 2020.\nOn 5 October 2022 all Worcester players had their contacts terminated due to the liquidation of the company to which they were contracted.\nInternational career.\nButler scored two tries on his England Under 17s debut against France and played his first game at Under 18 level against the corresponding French team in February 2016. Butler was also part of the England U20s squad which won the 2017 Six Nations Under 20 Championship, beating Scotland 33–5 in the finals. He was also part of the squad that reached the final of the 2017 World Rugby Under 20 Championship, where they were defeated by New Zealand."

Tournaments were over 72 holes.\nThe first event on the tour was the Taranaki Open in late 2004. The Taranaki Open was the only event in 2004 and 2005 but was joined by the Tauranga Open and the Wairakei Open in 2006. These three events, together with the AMP Open at Titirangi were played in 2007. In 2007 there was a dispute between the tour and the New Zealand PGA, which meant the Golf Tour of New Zealand withdrew their support for the Wairakei Open and, possibly, Taranaki Open, and the AMP Open was run without the sanction of the NZPGA. The tour was replaced by the Charles Tour which started in 2008."

All four professionals lost in the opening round. The tournament was won by Jonathan Barron, who defeated Ron Gross 4–3 in the final. The event was also referred to as the \"ITV tournament\" and the \"BACC Television Tournament\".\nSchedule and handicaps.\nThe intention had been for four professionals to compete against the four semi-finalists from the 1962 English Amateur Championship, but one of the amateurs, Alan Barnett, was unavailable. Geoff Thompson, holder of the world record amateur break, replaced Barnett. The schedule of matches was published in the Billiards Association and Control Council's magazine, \"The Billiard Player\", in August 1962. The players were assigned a handicap as shown in parentheses, receiving the relevant number of points at the start of each frame. The professional players are indicated with an asterisk. All matches were played at the National Liberal Club. The matches were broadcast on ITV.\nResults.\nGross defeated Davis 3–0 in their match, with Davis then winning the two \"dead\" . The match between Rea and Price went to a , with Price prevailing. Williams played poorly as he lost 0–3 and the two dead frames to Thompson. Barron won 3–1 against Kennerley, and also won the dead frame. Snooker historian Clive Everton attributes the losses by all the professional players in the tournament to the lack of opportunities for professionals to participate in competitive events, at a time when the playing standards between professionals and top amateurs were comparable.\nIn the semi-finals, Gross eliminated Thompson 3–2, and Barron defeated Price 3–1. The final, between Barron and Gross, was a rematch of the 1962 English Amateur Championship final, which Gross had won 11–9. Gross won the first frame, before Barron took a 3–1 lead and Gross levelled the match at 3–3. Barron won the deciding frame convincingly, to take the title.\nPlayers in bold denote match winners.\nFinal.\nScores in bold indicate winning scores."

It is located in NSW at Tweed Heads South, New South Wales. It was formed in 1932. It has hosted several notable tournaments including the Queensland Open and Gold Coast Classic.\nHistory.\nOn June 12, 1926, a group of golf enthusiasts met at Coolangatta Town Hall in Coolangatta, Queensland to advocate construction of a golf course. The following year a decision was made to create the course and in 1928 construction began. However, there were early environmental setbacks and a new site needed to be found. This was achieved in 1930 on a large parcel of land near the Tweed River at South Tweed Heads. Within two years the first nine holes were completed and the club opened on December 4, 1932. In 1951 the second nine holes were completed. In 1974 and 1981 two additional nine-hole sets were added to create two 18-hole championship courses known as the River course and West course. The entire club and courses' coverage is 101 hectares which takes in a large wildlife reserve.\nThe club has hosted a number of notable tournaments. On May 24, 1978, the club hosted its first Gold Coast Professional Gold Classic. It was an event on the PGA Tour of Australia and was held annually up to 1983. Notable champions included South African legend Gary Player, American Payne Stewart, and West Australian Graham Marsh. In 1986 the club hosted the Queensland Open which was won by the hot favourite, Queensland's multiple-major champion Greg Norman. It currently hosts the time-honoured Twin Towns Open, which has been the breeding ground for upcoming leading professionals.\nClub professionals.\nIn 1954, the club appointed reigning Queensland Open champion Reginald Want as club professional. One of his trainees was Charlie Earp who went on to become club professional at Royal Queensland in Brisbane and who later became the coach of World No.1 Greg \"The Shark\" Norman. In January 1980 Victorian Geoff Parslow became the club professional."

        "text": "The Super Bowl XXIII halftime show took place on January 22, 1989 at Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami, Florida. It was entitled \"BeBop Bamboozled in 3-D\". It featured a 1950s theme, an Elvis impersonator, 3D effects (for the broadcast audience), and a magic trick.\nSelection of MagiCom Entertainment as producer.\nThe NFL was looking to find new producers and ideas for its halftime shows in the years 1988, 1989, and 1990. NFL officials met with several individuals, among them was Dan Witkowski, a veteran stage illusionist and owner of the small company MagicCom, He did not give them specifics for a show at the meeting, but rather asked for the opportunity to give a formal presentation to them, which was granted. To pique the interest of the league officials, Witkowski put a padlock on the leather-bound pitch books he sent to the member of the league's halftime show selection committee ahead of his presentation. After his presentation, Witkowski and his company were given the opportunity to co-produce the 1988 Super Bowl pre-game show (as a dry-run of sorts) in addition to the 1989 halftime show.\nProduction.\nThe halftime show created was titled \"BeBop Bamboozled\". \nIt was decided that the show would have a 1950s theme. The show featured an Elvis impersonator dubbed \"Elvis Presto\", played by then-\"Solid Gold\" dancer Alex Cole. Despite this, not one actual Elvis Presley song was performed, and the show instead featured songs from musicals among other tunes. Cole had not originally been the individual cast to impersonate Elvis. Rather, he was the choreographer for an individual cast, who had previously played Elvis on Broadway. When that individual backed out, Cole was cast in his place. The vocals of \"Elvis Presto\" were pre-recorded, performed by Jody LoMedico.\nThe show featured roughly 2,000 South Florida-area dancers and performers. Among the choreographers was June Taylor. Donald Pippin was in charge of the music.\nA number of magic tricks had been considered by Witkowski. It was decided that their big trip would be a large-scale card trick.\nThe show also featured the use of 102 custom-made Harley Davidson motorcycles, as well as pink Cadillacs and fireworks.\nSeveral scenes included computer generated 3D images. Prior to the game, Coca-Cola distributed 3-D glasses at retailers for viewers to use. At the start of the halftime show, primary sponsor Diet Coke aired the first commercial in 3D. Coca-Cola had originally planned to use the 3D Diet Coke commercial as part of the \"Moonlighting\" season finale, which was also aired in 3D, but withdrew plans due to the 1988 Writers Guild of America Strike. This made the show the first 3D television event to be broadcast. Coca-Cola manufactured 26 million pairs of 3D glasses, despite the Super Bowl having a much greater audience.\nSynopsis.\nThe show began with a pre-taped introduction by Bob Costas, followed by the 3D Diet Coke commercial.\nThe show then began with \"Elvis Presto\" (an Elvis Presley impersonator), the performance's emcee, appearing from inside a jukebox.\nVarious songs were performed. Ironically, none of them were Elvis Presley songs.\nAmong the stunts in the show was the appearance of dancers defying gravity by leaning horizontally against parking meters.\n3D visual graphics were incorporated into the broadcast.\nA card trick was performed. Presto urged the stadium audience to pick one of four cards, and an applause meter indicated which card the audience had chosen.\nCritical reception.\nWriting for the Sun Sentinel, Jack Zink compared the show to the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. He also opined that the \"pregame entertainment was more enjoyable\". Many outlets have retrospectively ranked the show as among the worst halftime performances."

However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but William &amp; Mary's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

        "title": "Tri-Cornered Baseball Game",
        "text": "The Tri-Cornered Baseball Game was a three-way exhibition baseball game held at the Polo Grounds on June 26, 1944, among the Brooklyn Dodgers, New York Giants and New York Yankees. The game, a World War II fundraiser, was played with a round-robin format in which each team batted and fielded during six innings and rested for the other three. The Dodgers won by scoring five runs in their times at bat; the Yankees scored one run, while the Giants were unable to score.\nBackground.\nThe game came 20 days after the Normandy landings in 1944. It was devised by the War Loans Sports Committee as a method of selling war bonds to aid in the U.S. war efforts. Previously, Major League Baseball teams had each contributed revenue from one game's ticket sales to the war effort in 1943, while the New York City-based teams had helped to create an early fantasy baseball league named the \"Baseball War Bond League\". Committee chairman Max Kase, an editor for the \"New York Journal-American\" newspaper, played a key role in conceiving the contest, one of several sporting events that spurred bond sales. The Dodgers, Giants, and Yankees were to play each other in a three-way exhibition game at the Polo Grounds on June 26. Tickets were sold to fans in the form of the war bonds. Forty thousand unreserved tickets were sold for a $25 war bond each, with almost 10,000 reserved and box seats available for $100 or $1,000 bonds.\nAll three teams had win–loss records above .500 entering the exhibition. The Dodgers had a 33–30 win–loss record in the 1944 season and had won their previous five games. The Giants and Yankees had similar marks, at 32–29 and 31–29, respectively. \nAs with other Major League Baseball (MLB) clubs, the three New York City-based teams were fielding short-handed rosters, as many of their regulars were taking part in the war. The Yankees were missing their regular center fielder from previous seasons, Joe DiMaggio, while Johnny Mize was among the players absent from the Giants. The Dodgers' roster included shortstop Tommy Brown, who at the time was 16 years old and one of the youngest players to ever appear in an MLB game. However, Hall of Fame members Ernie Lombardi, Joe Medwick, and Paul Waner were among the participants. The managers were the same as usual for the teams: Leo Durocher for the Dodgers, Joe McCarthy for the Yankees, and Mel Ott for the Giants. Ott made an appearance as an outfielder as well.\nFormat.\nMathematician Paul Althaus Smith was consulted to help with formatting the unique game. Under the round-robin system devised, the three teams were each to bat and field for two innings in a row before taking a one-inning break. By the end, all three sides were scheduled to play in six innings each during a nine-inning game, and were slated to face their opponents for an equal amount of time, while batting and while playing defensively. This format meant that the teams would hit against each opponent three times. According to Smith, he had to use a slide rule while creating the system.\nThe Giants were able to use their usual home dugout at the Polo Grounds, while the visitors' dugout was occupied by both the Dodgers and Yankees. In response to the nature of the contest, one writer made a sarcastic recommendation that the organizers hire traffic police \"to avoid snarls of various descriptions.\" The game was to end after nine innings even if two or more teams tied for the most runs scored.\nGame summary.\nPrior to the start of the game, a series of skills contests were conducted. First, hitters used fungo bats to hit balls for distance; the longest blow was recorded by Brooklyn pitcher Cal McLish, who hit a ball over 410 feet. Then, catchers took part in a contest designed to test their throwing accuracy. A barrel was set up at second base and catchers attempted to throw a ball inside it from home plate. The Dodgers' Bobby Bragan was the winner. Sprints were also held, and former player Al Schacht made an appearance. The United States Coast Guard Band provided musical performances, having been introduced by Milton Berle.\nAt 8:45 p.m., the contest started. The Dodgers and Yankees were the first two teams to play in the game, as Brooklyn batted in the first inning against Yankees pitcher Al Lyons. Following a single by Goody Rosen, Augie Galan and Dixie Walker also had base hits, which led to the first run of the contest. Brooklyn did not add to their total in the inning, but held the Yankees scoreless in their half. The Giants entered the game in the second inning, as the Yankees rested. Against Giants pitcher Johnny Allen, the Dodgers padded their early lead. A walk by Mickey Owen was followed by an Eddie Stanky double, which plated Owen for Brooklyn's second run. Later in the inning, Stanky scored on a single by Frenchy Bordagaray. The Giants failed to score against the Dodgers in their turn at bat. The Yankees and Giants took part in the third inning; neither club managed to score.\nThe Dodgers and Yankees played during the fourth inning, the Giants and Dodgers took the field for the fifth, and the Yankees and Giants competed in the sixth. No further runs were scored in this stretch. The scoreless run continued in the seventh inning (the Dodgers and Yankees batted), before Brooklyn extended their lead in the eighth. Against Giants pitcher Frank Seward, Luis Olmo hit a single. Giants right fielder Danny Gardella then dove for a fly ball hit by Jack Bolling, but missed, enabling Bolling to reach third with a triple, which scored Olmo. Stanky then hit a sacrifice fly, which plated Bolling for Brooklyn's fifth run of the game. The Dodgers' play concluded with the end of the eighth inning, as the Yankees and Giants played in the ninth inning. The Yankees scored once in the ninth, as a single by Snuffy Stirnweiss was followed by a pair of fielding errors by Giant Buddy Kerr that allowed Stirnweiss to give the Yankees their only run of the game. The contest ended with the Dodgers having scored five runs, the Yankees one, and the Giants having been held scoreless. Although the Dodgers had won the game, they were not present when it finished. Following the eighth inning, the team left the Polo Grounds to travel to Chicago for a June 28 doubleheader.\nBox score.\nSource:\nReaction.\nThe three-way baseball game was attended by over 50,000 fans. A total of 49,605 people paid for tickets by buying war bonds. In addition, 500 injured veterans were given free admission. Ticket sales from the game raised about $4.5 million. In addition, the mayor of New York City, Fiorello La Guardia, pledged $50 million of bonds, and an additional $1 million was contributed by Bond Clothing Stores in exchange for an autographed program. Overall, more than $56 million was raised. \"New York Daily News\" sportswriter Dick Young described the event as \"the wackiest diamond battle ever conceived\"."

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019.\nHistory.\nThe building was constructed as a duckpin bowling alley in 1938 and 1939 for the Brookland Recreation Center, Inc., on 10th St. NE in the Washington, D.C., neighborhood of Brookland. It was designed by William Edward St. Cyr Barrington, an architect who had studied under Jules Henri de Sibour, in the Art Deco style. The building was initially one story tall, but a second story was added within a year of its opening.\nBowling saw a boom in popularity in this period as a form of cheap entertainment during the Great Depression. At the time of the Brookland Bowling Alleys' construction, there were 13 other commercial bowling alleys in D.C.\nThe Brookland Bowling Alleys was managed by prominent local bowlers. It operated for just over 10 years, until a major fire damaged the structure in 1950. The blaze was attributed to \"a cigarette, defective wiring or spontaneous combustion.\" The building was restored under Barrington's supervision, but it was repurposed as a wholesale store for electric lighting, parts, and appliances. It is currently occupied by Atlantic Electric Supply Corp.\nThe Brookland Bowling Alleys building is one of only a handful of remaining structures that once housed bowling alleys in D.C. The city's Historic Preservation Office described it as a \"visual landmark of the neighborhood.\" It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 19, 2019."

        "title": "International Tennis Integrity Agency",
        "text": "The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) is the organisation responsible for safeguarding the integrity of professional tennis worldwide. It is an upgraded version of Tennis Integrity Unit (2008–2020). It was established following a comprehensive review of integrity in the sport.\nThe ITIA assumed responsibility for administering the Tennis Anti-Corruption Program on its formation and for the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme on 1 January 2022.\nIn addition to prevention, education and drug testing activities, it gathers intelligence and investigates competition manipulation, most notably match fixing in tennis. It has the ability to impose fines and sanctions, and ban players, umpires, and other tennis officials from participating in sanctioned tournaments.\nThe organisation is an initiative from the International Governing Bodies (IGBs) of professional tennis: the ITF, ATP, WTA, and the four Grand Slam tournaments (the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and US Open). The ITIA is legally independent of the IGBs and makes its own decisions on investigations and prosecutions. In this respect it is unusual in global sports.\nGovernance.\nThe ITIA is supervised by the Tennis Integrity Supervisory Board (TISB) which has 5 independent members and 4 tennis members, representing the IGBs. The TISB is currently chaired by Jennie Price CBE, former CEO of Sport England.\nLeadership and staff.\nThe ITIA was founded by its first CEO Jonny Gray, a former Senior Partner and Global Head of Sport at Control Risks. And a former commanding officer of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, decorated for service in the Troubles and the Iraq War. Appointed in 2019, it was announced in 2022 that he would step down having made a 'significant contribution to integrity in tennis'. In late 2022 it was announced that he would be succeeded by Karen Moorhouse, an executive with the Rugby Football League.\nIt has three Senior Directors. These are:\nThe ITIA has around 35 staff across intelligence, investigations, anti-doping, education &amp; training, legal/case management, communications and administration.\nTennis Anti-Corruption Program.\nOne of the main responsibilities of the ITIA is to administer the Tennis Anti-Corruption Program (TACP) on behalf of the IGBs. The TACP is sets out the various corruption offences in professional tennis, including those related to betting, match fixing and competition manipulation. The ITIA investigates possible offences of the TACP. When it has a sufficiency of evidence it submits a case to an independent Anti-Corruption Hearing Officer (AHO) for a first instance hearing. There are currently seven AHOs. Appeals of first instance decisions are heard \"de novo\" at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland.\nTennis Anti-Doping Programme.\nAnother main responsibility of the ITIA is to administer the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme (TADP) on behalf of the IGBs. Professional tennis players are tested for substances prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (‘WADA’) and, upon a finding that an Anti-Doping Rule Violation has been committed, sanctions are imposed under the Programme in compliance with the requirements of the World Anti-Doping Code.\nTennis Integrity Protection Programme.\nThe ITIA also administers the Tennis Integrity Protection Programme (TIPP). TIPP is an interactive online e-learning programme designed to inform participants in the sport and thus to protect the integrity of the sport. TIPP is mandatory for all players and officials and must be completed every 2 years. The ITIA also recommend that all those working in tennis such as coaches, tournament staff and agents complete the programme."

        "text": "John Gerard Leonard (born August 7, 1998) is an American professional ice hockey player for the Tucson Roadrunners of the American Hockey League (AHL) while under contract to the Utah NHL team of the National Hockey League (NHL). Leonard was drafted in the sixth round, 182nd overall, by the San Jose Sharks in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft.\nPlaying career.\nLeonard was originally first eligible to be drafted in 2016, but was not selected while playing for the Green Bay Gamblers of the United States Hockey League. After two years with the Gamblers, Leonard joined the University of Massachusetts Amherst (\"UMass\"), playing for their ice hockey team, the UMass Minutemen while studying Communications and Sport Management. While with the Minutemen, Leonard caught the attention of the San Jose Sharks, who drafted him in the sixth round, 182nd overall in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft despite not having any contact with Leonard during the predraft process. In his third year at UMass, Leonard was a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award and lead all NCAA players in goals, with 27.\nOn March 31, 2020, Leonard decided to forgo his final year of college eligibility and was signed to a three-year entry-level contract with the Sharks. Leonard made the opening night roster and made his NHL debut against the Arizona Coyotes on January 14, 2021, playing on a line with Evander Kane and Tomáš Hertl. Leonard posted two points in his debut, assisting on goals by both his linemates, helping the Sharks to a 4–3 shootout victory. His first goal came in a 3–2 win over the Anaheim Ducks on February 15, 2021.\nAfter his second full professional season within the Sharks organization, on July 8, 2022, Leonard was traded along with a 2023 third-round pick at the 2022 NHL Entry Draft to the Nashville Predators in exchange for Luke Kunin. On July 18, 2022, Leonard was signed as a restricted free agent to a one-year, two-way contract with the Predators for the season. He spent the majority of the season with Nashville's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals, scoring 17 goals and 27 points in 67 games. He got into six games with Nashville and scored his first goal (the game winner) in his first game for the team against Sergei Bobrovsky on March 2, 2023, in a 2–1 win over the Florida Panthers. At the end of the season, again a restricted free agent, he was not given a qualifying offer by Nashville and became an unrestricted free agent.\nLeonard signed a one-year, two-way contract with the Arizona Coyotes on July 3, 2023. He attended the Coyotes' 2023 training camp but was placed on waivers. After going unclaimed, he was assigned to Arizona's AHL affiliate, the Tucson Roadrunners to start the 2023–24 season. He was recalled by Arizona on March 12, 2024 after an injury to Barrett Hayton. Leonard made his Coyotes debut on March 14 versus the Detroit Red Wings. He scored his first goal with the Coyotes against Jake Oettinger in his fourth game, a 5–2 loss to the Dallas Stars on March 20.\nPersonal life.\nLeonard was born on August 7, 1998, to parents John and Cindy Leonard. He has three siblings. His brother, Ryan, is committed to play college ice hockey at Boston College. His father, John Sr., was an assistant coach for the UMass Minutemen basketball team between 2001 and 2005."

        "text": "Chuck Smith (born December 21, 1957) is a former American football coach. Smith served as the head coach at Boyle County High School, Campbellsville High School, and Allen County Scottsville High School. Smith also served as linebackers coach at the University of Kentucky. At Boyle County, Smith won six state championships and a KHSAA record breaking five in a row from 1999 to 2003. Smith is highly regarded as one of the best football coaches in Kentucky high school football history.\nEarly life and education.\nSmith was born on December 21, 1957 in Louisville, Kentucky. He was an all-state linebacker at Jeffersontown High School, graduating in 1977. He was a linebacker for the University of Kentucky from 1978 to 1980.\nCoaching career.\nEarly coaching career.\nShortly after Smith's playing career at Kentucky, Smith began his coaching career at Mercer county High School as an assistant under long-time coach Larry French. After three years with the Scotties, Smith accepted the head coaching job at Allen County Scottsville High School having a 6–5 season. After one year with the Patriots, Smith accepted the head coaching job at Campbellsville High School leading to a turnaround for the Eagles football program.\nBoyle County.\nAfter revitalizing Campbellsville's football program, Smith accepted the head coaching job at Boyle County High School. Prior to Smith's arrival at Boyle County, the Rebels had not had a winning season since 1986 when they went 7–4. Additionally, they had not had a ten win season since 1976. During the 1992 season, Smith's first Rebels team went 7–4 snapping a 6-year losing record streak. Three years later, Smith's Rebels went 10–3, their first ten win season in 19 years. Four years later Smith has the first undefeated 15–0 season in Boyle County football history and won Boyle's first state championship in school history. From 1999 to 2003, Smith's Rebels won a then state record breaking five state championships in a row, four of them being undefeated 15–0 seasons led by 2001 Kentucky Mr. Football winner Jeff Duggins and future NFL tight end Jacob Tamme.\nKentucky.\nFollowing an incredible run at Boyle County, Smith accepted his dream job, coaching linebackers at Kentucky. Under head coaches Rich Brooks and Joker Phillips, Smith coached four first team All-SEC linebackers. Those names include Super Bowl 50 champion Danny Trevathan, Wesley Woodyard, Micah Johnson, and Sam Maxwell.\nReturn to Boyle County.\nAfter leaving Kentucky, Smith had a one-year stint as defensive coordinator at Bardstown High School. In 2014, Smith accepted the head coaching job at Madison Central High School. However, that was short-lived because less than three weeks later Smith resigned. Following Smith's resignation from Madison Central, Smith returned to head coaching at Boyle County due to the departure of former Boyle head coach Larry French. During Smith's second tenure with the Rebels, he compiled a record of 69–12 with one state championship title.\nHead coaching record.\nBelow is a year-by-year breakdown of Smith's coaching record.\nPersonal life.\nSmith is married to Jackie Smith.\nSmith has two children, Brandon and Nicole. Brandon is the head coach at South Warren High School in Bowling Green, Kentucky, where he has won two KHSAA state championships."
