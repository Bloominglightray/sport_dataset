The race began on 17 May 1940 in Milan with a stage that stretched to Turin, finishing back in Milan on 9 June 1940 after a stage and a total distance covered of .\nThe race was won by Fausto Coppi (at his first participation) of the Legnano team, with fellow Italians Enrico Mollo and Giordano Cottur coming in second and third respectively.\nCoppi, who was 20 years old at the time, is the youngest winner of the Giro.\nParticipants.\nOf the 91 riders that began the Giro d'Italia on 17 May 1940, 47 of them made it to the finish in Milan on 9 June May. Riders were allowed to ride as a member of a team or group; 41 riders competed as part of a team, while the remaining 50 competed as a part of a group. The eight teams that partook in the race were: Bianchi, Legnano, Gloria, Olympia, Lygie, Gerbi. Each team started with either six or seven riders. The Ganna team did not start the race due to the team's Belgian riders not being cleared to enter the country. There were also seven groups, made up of three to five riders each, that participated in the race. Those groups were: S. C. Binda, G. S. Battisti-Aquilano, U. S. Azzini-Universal, Cicli Viscontea, Dopolavoro Az. Bemberg, U. C. Modenese, Il Littoriale, Dopolavoro Az. Vismara, S. S. Parioli, and G. S. Mater.\nThe peloton was composed primarily of Italian riders. The field featured two former Giro d'Italia winners with two-time winners Gino Bartali and Giovanni Valetti, who was the reigning champion. Bartali studied the route for the Giro intensely during the winter before the race and during reconnaissance rides, he befriended local business owners with the hopes of contacting for local road and weather conditions during the race. Other notable Italian riders included Olimpio Bizzi, Ezio Cecchi, and Fausto Coppi. The only non-Italian riders to compete in the race were Luxembourgian Christophe Didier and Swiss rider Walter Diggelmann. Bartali and Valetti were both seen a strong contenders for the overall title.\nRace overview.\nDuring the second stage, Bartali crashed into a dog that ran onto the road, throwing him from the bike. He returned to his bike, but a doctor examination after finishing the stage, led the diagnosis of a strained muscle and a recommendation to withdraw from the race. Bartali elected to remain the race, but knew he could not win.\nClassification leadership.\nThe leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nIn the mountains classification, the race organizers selected different mountains that the route crossed and awarded points to the riders who crossed them first.\nThe winner of the team classification was determined by adding the finish times of the best three cyclists per team together and the team with the lowest total time was the winner. If a team had fewer than three riders finish, they were not eligible for the classification. The group classification was decided in the same manner, but the classification was exclusive to the competing groups.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.\nFinal standings.\nGroup classification.\nGiovanni De Stefanis won the special category prize which was the best ranked group rider in the general classification."

They earned the Rose Bowl berth on the strength of their 20–9 victory over #4 Michigan in their rivalry game that decided the Big Ten title and rose back to second, behind Texas.

After an easy win over San Jose State, they traveled north to Eugene for a game that featured a quarterback battle between Plunkett and Oregon sophomore Dan Fouts. Stanford won but then were caught looking ahead to their showdown with USC and lost at home to Purdue. They then beat four-time defending Pac-8 champion USC at Stanford, (avenging a last second loss to the Trojans the year before).

The tour also took in several matches against British and Irish club, county and invitational teams. This was the fourth South Africa tour and the third tour of the Northern Hemisphere.\nThe tour was extremely successful for the South Africans, as the team only lost a single match. In the tests played the team beat all four home nations. The only team to beat the Springboks was the invitational East Midlands county team. The final tour record saw 26 matches played, with South Africa winning 23, losing one and drawing two.\nCriticism of playing style.\nAlthough very successful on the pitch, the touring South Africans were unloved by their hosts and the press back home. Bennie Osler, the South African captain, introduced a style of play which centred on a continual kicking game; either into touch in an attempt to support his large pack or diagonally across the pitch for his wings to chase. This was seen by many critics of the time as 10-man tactics, with the backs taken out of the match, and thus the entertainment brought by previous South African tours removed.\nWelsh journalist 'Old Stager' stated \"The Africans, by adherence to ten-man rugby, are winning their matches, but are not capturing the hearts and the imagination of rugby followers...\". O.L. Owen in his \"History of the RFU\" concurred with these thoughts, \"The least spectacular and, so far as back play was concerned, the most disappointing of the South African touring sides...\""

It was one of nine gymnastics events and it was contested for the third time after 1896 and 1904. The competition was held on Saturday, July 19, 1924. Seventy-two gymnasts from nine nations competed. The event was won by Leon Štukelj of Yugoslavia, with Jean Gutweninger of Switzerland taking silver and André Higelin of France bronze. It was the first medal in the horizontal bar for each of those nations.\nBackground.\nThis was the third appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). The 1922 world championship had ended in a three-way tie; two of the winners were competing in Paris: Leon Štukelj of Yugoslavia and Miroslav Klinger of Czechoslovakia.\nTwo nations had previously competed, Switzerland in 1896 and the United States in 1904. The other seven nations (Czechoslovakia, Finland, France, Great Britain, Italy, Luxembourg, and Yugoslavia) were competing for the first time.\nCompetition format.\nEach gymnast performed a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise. These two exercises were 2 of the 11 components of the individual all-around score, and thus were also included in the team all-around score. Each exercise had a maximum possible score of 11, with half a point each for the approach and dismount and up to 10 points for the routine."

The Competition operates a three divisional system with Premier, First and Second Divisions. The Southport and District Amateur Cricket League is its feeder league.\nHistory.\nAlthough many of the district's clubs had met regularly as far back as 1850, if not earlier, it was not until 1892 that a Liverpool newspaper began publishing a weekly table and calling it the Liverpool Competition to create more interest in the game. The eleven senior clubs making up the original table were Birkenhead Park, Bootle, Formby, Huyton, Liverpool, New Brighton, Northern, Ormskirk, Oxton, Rock Ferry and Sefton.\nNeston were offered first team fixtures in 1908 and, in 1919, Hightown and Southport and Birkdale joined whilst Wallasey took over the fixtures of the Rock Ferry club who did not resume after the First War. Boughton Hall (later known as Chester Boughton Hall) were invited to join in 1923. The Competition continued until 1947 when it was decided to admit a sixteenth club, and Preston were voted in. Two years later, fixtures were standardised by all clubs agreeing to meet each other, and although there was no suggestion of a league, it was decided to regard the table as official. Preston resigned at the end of the 1952 season to be replaced by St Helens Recs in 1953.\nIn recent years the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition has changed radically. There was an expansion in 1996 that introduced clubs from further afield in Lancashire and North Wales but saw founder members Birkenhead Park, Chester Boughton Hall, Neston and Oxton resign to join the Cheshire County Cricket League for the 1998 season. Of the four, only Oxton had failed to be champions of the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition. In 1999 a two division structure was introduced, and in 2000 the 1st XI Premier Division was awarded ECB Premier League status.\nFrom the end of the 2004 season, promotion from and relegation to the Merseyside and Southport Cricket Alliance feeder league was introduced, but was then curtailed from the end of the 2009 season. At this time, additional clubs from the Alliance were invited to join, to form a new three divisional structure.\n2nd XIs play in a similar three divisional structure but independent of the 1st XIs. There is a two divisional structure for Saturday 3rd XIs and below, with another structure for those clubs preferring to play on Sundays. They have three Divisions, Premier, Division 1 North and Division 1South ."

        "text": "The Middlesex County Cricket League (MCCL) is the only adult Saturday league for recreational club cricket in the historic county of Middlesex, England. In practical terms, this means it encompasses teams from North and West London. The league was founded in 1972, and since 1999 the top division of the Middlesex County Cricket League has been a designated ECB Premier League. \nFour MCCL clubs have won the ECB National Club Cricket Championship: Enfield (1988), Hampstead (1969), Southgate (1977), and Teddington (1989 and 1991). Ealing have won the ECB National Club Twenty20 twice (2011 and 2015).\nHistory.\nThe MCCL was officially founded in 1972, after holding a 'dry run' in 1971 to ensure that the league's launch went smoothly. It was founded with 16 clubs as members (Brentham, Brondesbury, Ealing, Edmonton, Enfield, Finchley, Hornsey, North Middlesex, Richmond, Shepherds Bush, South Hampstead, Southgate, Stanmore, Teddington, Wembley, and Winchmore Hill), and in the first season Hornsey won the league title with ten wins from their fifteen fixtures. Nine of the ten clubs who are expected to play in the Premier Division in 2024 were among these founder members.\nThe format of matches was the same for the formation of the league until 2014, with all matches played on a \"timed\" basis, with draws possible. From 2015 onwards, the format was changed in the Premier Division such that half the matches were timed, and half played in a limited overs format; in 2016, other divisions followed, with all adopting split formats.\nThe dominant team in the league has evolved over time, with Finchley dominant in the 1970s and 1990s, while Ealing won an unprecedented seven consecutive titles from 2005 to 2011.\nLeague Structure.\nThe league is played (other than in the lowest divisions) between divisions of ten clubs, each playing the other members of their division twice for an 18 week season, commencing in early May and ending in early September. Divisions are segregated so that a first XI from one club will only play first XIs of other clubs; the same is the case for second XIs, while third, fourth and fifth XIs play in a merged competition. The MCCL has undergone two major mergers in recent years, merging with the 1987 League in 2019, and then subsequently absorbing the Middlesex Championship ahead of the 2021 season. Following those mergers the League consists of six full divisions and a shorthanded seventh division for first XIs; five full divisions and a reduced size fifth division for second XIs; and nine divisions for third, fourth and fifth XIs.\nWinners.\nMiddlesex County Cricket League since 1972.\nSource: "

They take place in two biennial formats; in even years they take place in tandem with a junior men's competition, and historically have included a team event, but not an individual all-around. In odd years, they are held in tandem with the European Women's Artistic Gymnastics Championships, and include a team competition. These events are sometimes called the European Individual Artistic Gymnastics Championships. Despite the alternating formats, all winners are considered European champions with one medal table.\nThe event is not to be confused with the gymnastics program of the European Games, whose champions are crowned as European Games champions, but not European champions.\nHistory.\nOriginally held biannually and in odd-numbered years, the championships moved to even-numbered years in 1990. In 2005 a second set of championships was introduced, titled the \"individual championships\". Although numbered as a separate event, winners in either event are considered European champions, and the championships as a result have in effect become an annual event, but in two formats; in even-numbered years, a stand-alone men's event incorporates the European Junior Artistic Gymnastics championships (an entirely separate women's competition is held in the same years), while in odd-numbered years, the separately numbered 'individual championships' are held in conjunction with the women's competition of the same description, but without juniors, as a single event.\nAs a result, there is no individual all-around title awarded in even-numbered years (except for juniors), and similarly no team all-around title awarded in odd-numbered years. These thus remain biannual events. Otherwise the apparatus and titles are identical.\nIn 2015, UEG agreed that beginning in 2018, the annual European Championships in the midyear of the Olympic cycle (i.e. 2 years after, and before, a Summer Olympic Games) would be held as part of the new multi-sport European Championships event, and would be held in that format every four years. These combined events will continue to be run by UEG and the other sports federations. Although both the Men's and Women's championships will be held together, in the same venue, these championships will continue to be treated as separate men's and women's events, with junior events included.\nA further event, the European Games also holds a full set of championships for European artistic gymnasts in the year preceding the Summer Olympic Games, having begun in 2015. These, however, are organized by the European Olympic Committees and are not recognized as part of the continuity of the European Championships.\nChampionships.\nBefore 1996, European men's championships were held separately for both Seniors and Juniors. Beginning in 1996, Senior and Junior men's championships were combined. In 2005 a new and combined European Men's and Women's Artistic Gymnastics Individual Championships were inaugurated for senior gymnasts only. Although these championships are numbered separately, and the medals awarded counted separately, they constitute European Championships in the same manner as the men- and women-only competitions they alternate with, and the winners are considered European champions in the same way. For that reason, a list of those championships is also included in the section below.\nThe 2018 and 2022 editions of the Men's Championships formed part of the multi-sport European Championships of those years.\nMedal table.\nSeniors.\nAs of 2024."

Pack\" compilation for the Nintendo DS. In November 2008, it was made available for the iOS via Apple's App Store.\nA sequel, \"Midnight Bowling 2\", was also later released for phones.\nGameplay.\nThe game features a story mode which revolves around the player competing in a hipster-themed bowling tournament. In addition, along with quick play single and multiplayer modes, the WiiWare version also features a Party Mode, in which players race across a game board by completing challenges such as trying to bowl their ball through a loop or past obstacles.\nControl.\nOn the Wii, players use the motion controls of the Wii Remote to bowl, miming the action to bowl in similar manner to \"Wii Sports Bowling\".\nReception.\n\"IGN\" gave \"Midnight Bowling\" for WiiWare a 4.9/10, highly praising the presentation and Party Mode, but felt Gameloft \"dropped the ball\" with the controls, citing an \"awful swing mechanic\" that leaves it \"almost impossible to roll the ball consistently and successfully\". WiiWare World gave it a 2/10, citing the same control issues as \"IGN\" and stating it \"throws everything \"Wii Sports\" did so well control-wise out of the window, replacing it with its own very weird control scheme\" that may leave the player \"wondering if this is some sort of cartoonish bowling inspired game that is not really bowling\"."

He threw right-handed and batted left-handed.\nCareer.\nThe New York Mets drafted Baldwin in the ninth round of the 1971 Major League Baseball draft straight out of Thomas Downey High School in Modesto, California. Used primarily as a starting pitcher his first two seasons in the minors, he began seeing more work as a relief pitcher in , and was used almost exclusively as a reliever in . He compiled a 34–25 record with ten saves and a 4.03 earned run average over four seasons in the Mets' farm system when he earned a spot on the major league roster to start the season.\nHe made his major league debut on April 10, pitching a scoreless eighth inning in the Mets second game of the season, a 3–2 11-inning loss to the Philadelphia Phillies at Shea Stadium. He blew saves in his next two appearances, losing one and winning the other. In his next appearance, against the Chicago Cubs, Baldwin replaced Randy Tate in the seventh inning with runners on second and third and nobody out. He induced a weak fly ball, then struck out the next two batters to escape the inning without allowing a runner to score. He cruised along until the ninth, when he loaded the bases with two outs. A single by José Cardenal was misplayed by Mets left fielder Dave Kingman, allowing all three runners to score, and Cardenal to advance to third with the tying run, and slugging third baseman Bill Madlock coming to bat. Madlock flew out to right to end the game, and give Baldwin his first career save.\nAfter getting off to a rough start (4.07 ERA through the first 2 months of the season), Baldwin emerged as one of the more reliable arms in manager Yogi Berra's bullpen (2.01 ERA in the month of June). For the season, Baldwin went 3–5 with a 3.33 ERA. He led Mets relievers in appearances (54) and innings pitched (97.1), and his six saves were second to Bob Apodaca (15).\nDespite this modest success his rookie season, Baldwin spent most of the season with the triple A Tidewater Tides, going 8–4 with 14 saves and a 2.31 ERA. He made a brief call up in late May, making six appearances, mostly in \"mop up duty.\" He returned as a September call up, and allowed just one earned run over 7.2 innings of work. All told, he was 0–0 in 22.7 innings, with an ERA of 2.38.\nBaldwin also began the season in Tidewater, but was called up to the majors after the Mets released Ray Sadecki in early May. He had a 1–2 record and one save in 40 appearances, with a 4.45 ERA in 62.7 innings. Baldwin's final major league appearance came on October 2, 1977, when he faced two batters in the ninth inning, earning a save in a 6–4 Met win over the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Memorial Stadium.\nBaldwin was selected by the Seattle Mariners in the Rule 5 draft on December 5, 1977. In the season he had a 3–5 record with the Triple-A San Jose Missions (a Mariners affiliate) in the Pacific Coast League and a 3–3 record with the Columbus Clippers of the Triple-A International League (an affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates).\nBaldwin died from complications of COVID-19 in Modesto, California, on October 30, 2020, aged 67.\nExternal links.\n, or The Ultimate Mets Database"

        "text": "1976 Ireland rugby union tour of New Zealand and Fiji. The Ireland national rugby union team toured New Zealand and Fiji for the first time in 1976. Although Ireland had first played the All Blacks in 1905, this tour saw Ireland play them away for the first time.\nHowever, the tour is probably best remembered for the final game against Fiji. A tired Ireland team arrived in Fiji only to discover that, as a result of a scheduling mistake, the senior Fiji team were actually on tour in Australia. The Fiji Rugby Union managed to bring together a small group of first-team players and stand-ins. The official attendance was 12,000, but Fijian newspapers reported closer to 17,000, with many locals packed into tight surroundings. The try-line was exceptionally close to the deadball-line, with Tony Ensor at one point running over both the try-line and deadball-line. As well as playing in extremely hot weather, the teams also had to deal with a pitch invasion by dozens of frogs. Despite Ireland's inexperience with such conditions, they ran out winners, 0–8. Mike Gibson, Willie Duggan, Philip Orr and Moss Keane all returned to New Zealand with the British Lions for their 1977 tour."

Ireland won seven of the eight matches they played, including both tests against Australia. The only defeat came against Sydney. The tour also marked a notable episode in the rivalry between the two Ireland fly halves, Tony Ward and Ollie Campbell. Ward had been an ever present during both the 1978 and 1979 Five Nations Championships and he also played in the early games during this tour. However he was then dropped before the first test in favour of Campbell. Campbell subsequently emerged as man of the tour, setting an Irish record when he scored 60 points during the remaining games. On 3 June in Brisbane he scored 19 points, helping Ireland to a 27–12 victory. Campbell scored four penalties, one drop goal and converted two Colin Patterson tries. In the second test on 16 June Campbell scored two drop goals and a penalty as Ireland won 9–3. These two tests also marked the beginning and the end of the careers of two Ireland rugby legends. The first test saw the debut of Ciaran Fitzgerald while the second saw Mike Gibson make his final Ireland appearance. While on this tour Ned Byrne was the victim of a hit and run road accident which left his leg broken in three places."

        "title": "Major League Baseball blackout policy",
        "text": "Major League Baseball has rules for exclusive broadcasting, called 'blackout' rules, which bar certain areas from watching livegames. \nMost blackouts are for two reasons: The first is local cable providers' desire for exclusive broadcasting. The second, MLB's desire to drive stadium attendance. Select regular season games, special events, and postseason games will also be subject to exclusivity deals with, for example, networks like Fox owning the rights to afternoon MLB games on Saturdays and ESPN the same rights for night games on Sundays.\nUnited States.\nAlmost every part of the Contiguous United States has at least one team blacked out from watching, with some having more. As the map shows, every team has its local area (AKA home market) blackout. Beyond that, some teams have several surrounding states that are also blacked out. For example, the Kansas City Royals are blacked out from view in the state of Missouri (except in the St. Louis metro area), Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Iowa.\nThe worst state blackout-wise is Iowa, which is blacked out by six teams: Brewers, Cardinals, Cubs, Royals, Twins, and the White Sox, even though all are a multi-hour drive to see any of the teams in person. Local broadcasts are not necessarily available in the whole blackout territory. For example, Bally Sports Wisconsin is unavailable in Iowa, so Milwaukee Brewers games are unavailable in the state. So not only can Iowa not get the Brewers on local channels, but they also can't get them on streaming due to being \"in the market.\" Las Vegas is another example of fans having restricted viewership, as the Arizona Diamondbacks, Los Angeles Angels, Los Angeles Dodgers, Oakland A’s San Diego Padres, and San Francisco Giants are all blacked out as well despite the fact that the closest teams’ stadiums are roughly 5 hours away.\nDue to the fact that they play in Canada, the Toronto Blue Jays do not have any part of their blackout territory in the United States. However, some MLB teams have blackouts that extend into Canada.\nESPN Deal.\nA new contract between ESPN and Major League Baseball in 2012 virtually eliminated local blackouts involving the network's Monday and Wednesday night games, allowing ESPN coverage to co-exist with that of the local broadcasters in home markets. The agreement took effect at the start of the season and lasted until 2021.\nA contract extension between ESPN/MLB was struck in 2021, lasting until 2028.\nApple TV Deal.\nIn March 2022 MLB and Apple signed a streaming deal worth $85 million annually. Through this streaming deal, Apple will broadcast a doubleheader every Friday, during the regular season on their streaming platform Apple TV+.\nBally Sports bankruptcy.\nDue to the parent company of the Bally Regional Sports network, Diamond Sports Group, applying for bankruptcy, there have been calls to end the blackout rule so that local fans can no longer rely on only cable providers to watch their teams games.\nCanada.\nThe Toronto Blue Jays' blackout territory includes all of Canada. However, they must share British Columbia and Alberta with the Seattle Mariners, Saskatchewan and Manitoba with the Minnesota Twins, and the Maritimes with the Boston Red Sox. In the past, the province of Quebec was not included in Toronto's territory, as it belonged to the Montreal Expos exclusively. Toronto and Montreal shared all territory outside of Ontario and Quebec. Toronto Blue Jays games are aired on Sportsnet in Canada. Also, Blue Jays games broadcast nationally over-the-air on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation television network have occasionally been subject to local blackout on CBET-TV in Windsor, Ontario, to protect the territorial rights of the Detroit Tigers across the Detroit River. No American RSNs are available on Canadian specialty television providers.\nConsumer devices.\nConsumer devices that enable television subscribers to transmit their home television feed outside their host area to a remote location over the Internet, a practice called placeshifting, have drawn the ire of MLB. MLB's position is that subscribers who wish to watch MLB telecasts while traveling either settle for the local telecasts available or subscribe to MLB's own broadcasts for an additional fee. Consumer advocates insist the practice is legal since the remoted content is already purchased and is merely placeshifted by the subscriber; they claim MLB is asking fans to pay twice for the same content. MLB counters that travelers utilizing placeshifting technology are undercutting the blackout rights MLB grants to local and national broadcasters, as well as MLB's own internet service.\nIn 2009, MLB launched MLB Network on basic cable similar to the NFL Network. As part of the new network, MLB has told owners to reduce their blackouts due to outrage amongst fans and letters pouring into MLB's offices. In particular, MLB is looking to address the availability of regional sports networks outside teams' immediate home markets. Ostensibly, if teams/channels are not available in certain locations, teams could lose their claims to such areas and coverage would be replaced by the MLB-controlled \"Extra Innings\" service.\nRadio blackouts.\nIn MLB, there are radio blackouts. ESPN Radio has exclusive rights to the World Series and only the flagship stations of the two participating ballclubs can originate coverage, though their broadcasts are also available on Sirius XM (as of April 2021, both on satellite radio and streaming), as well as the subscription Gameday Audio package on MLB.com and MLB.tv. All other network affiliates of the two clubs must carry the ESPN Radio feed, and they may not even be able to do so if they compete with an ESPN Radio affiliate in the same market. Additionally, the two flagships must broadcast ESPN Radio national commercials during their game coverage (though they can run live commercial reads for local sponsors during broadcasts and sell ads during typically extended pre/post-game shows. WCNN, the Braves' flagship station, occasionally didn't air such national commercials and aired its normal local advertising during its coverage 2021 World Series, and also didn't credit ESPN's sponsorship). The flagship stations are also required to credit the same presenting radio sponsor of the World Series as ESPN Radio (in recent years, AutoZone).\nAdditionally, radio stations (including flagships) are not allowed to broadcast any MLB games in the live Internet streams of their station programming outside of the flagship station's DMA (example: WDAE, which is the Rays Radio Network flagship, is only allowed to stream its coverage within Pasco, Pinellas, and Hillsborough counties) or on out-of-market radio affiliates that carry the station's main signal. (MLB makes its own streams of the team networks available for a fee.) Some stations will replace the game with a recorded message explaining why the game cannot be heard on their stream. Others will simply stream the station's regularly scheduled programming that is being preempted by the game. Additionally, ESPN Radio also restricts online streaming of their coverage of regular season games to listeners located both within the United States and outside the markets of the teams involved in the games, regardless of the application used.\nDuring the 2021 Postseason, the Atlanta Braves streamed its coverage of their entire postseason run completely free of geo-blocking restrictions, including their NLDS, NLCS, and World Series appearances."

He was a United States Army veteran of World War II.\nHeath stood tall and weighed and batted and threw right-handed during his playing days. He appeared in 134 total MLB games for the Browns, compiling a batting average of .230 in 330 at bats with 76 hits (including three home runs) and 34 runs batted in. \nHeath was somewhat better known for his 18-year career as a minor league manager (1947–64), where he principally worked in the New York Giants and Los Angeles Angels farm systems, and in between piloted four Pacific Coast League clubs between 1952 and 1961. As the leader of the Giants' Minneapolis Millers Triple-A affiliate (1949–51), he managed future major leaguers such as Willie Mays and Hoyt Wilhelm — both members of the Baseball Hall of Fame. In 1948, he managed the Trenton Giants to the Interstate League championship, the only title he won during his managerial career.\nHeath served as a scout for the Angels after his managing career ended. He died at age 53 in Los Gatos, California."

        "title": "WBC Legends of Boxing Museum",
        "text": "The WBC Legends of Boxing Museum, located at the American Sports University in San Bernardino, California, is a museum that pays honor to the achievements and accomplishments of some of the most famous boxers of all time, more specifically past World Boxing Council champions. The WBC is one of the four (WBA, WBC, WBO, IBF) major sanctioning bodies in boxing. The museum's motto is, \"Great fighters may retire, but their greatness lives on forever.\" This quote was created by Board Member Eric Casillas.\nPurpose.\nThe museum enables boxing fans as well as the general public to come view items and artifacts which are displayed for inspiration, learning, and enjoyment for the continued legacy of boxing .\nHistory.\nThe World Boxing Council has been in existence since the early 1960s and has crowned some of the most legendary boxers to ever lace them up, yet, prior to the opening of the museum, there was no place that housed the treasures and history of past WBC Champions. In June 2008 that all changed. Former WBC President Dr. Jose Sulaiman, founder and chairman of American Sports University Dr. Harry Hwang, WBC Supervisor Dr. Rudy Tellez, WBC LBM Co-Chairman Jaime Ochoa and Vincent Johnson and Directors Angel Ochoa and Eric Casillas are the founding fathers of this museum and spearheaded its creation . A Grand Opening was held on June 27, 2008 and an estimated 700 people including fans, civic leaders, press, and legendary fighters attended this event.\nWBC Hall of Fame.\nThe WBC has a long-standing history of champions. The WBC Hall of Fame includes fighters like Bob Foster, Mike Tyson, Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Leonard, Jose Napoles, Nino Benvenuti, Ken Norton, Salvador Sanchez, Ruben Olivares, Lupe Pintor, Marvin Hagler, Joe Frazier, Wilfred Benítez, Wilfredo Gómez and more.\nBoard of directors.\nThe WBC Legends of Boxing Museum is run by a Board of Directors who fulfill duties ranging from the induction of fighters, design of the museum, setting and preparing events, contacting press and media, review and consideration of prized artifacts, hosting induction ceremonies, etc. The Board of Directors currently has 15 members.\nInductees.\nThose that are honored and inducted into the WBC Legends of Boxing Museum are screened by the Board of Directors that rigorously review the achievements and accomplishments of the boxer nominated. The nominee will gain induction upon majority vote. If the boxer does not receive a majority vote decision by the board members, the individual may be nominated in the future for reconsideration of his induction into the WBC Legends of Boxing Museum. Typically, the boxer needs to be five years retired from the sport to be eligible for induction and must have displayed outstanding achievements and accomplishments in their boxing career.\nInaugural Members of the WBC Legends of Boxing Museum.\nThe first members honored and enshrined at the museum was the WBC Hall of Fame Class of 2008. Class of 2008 Inductees were Ken Norton, Danny \"Lil Red\" Lopez, Armando Ramos, Erubey \"Chango\" Carmona, Lennox Lewis, Genaro \"Chicanito\" Hernandez, Gabriel Ruelas, Diego \"Chico\" Corrales, Roger Mayweather, Rodolfo \"El Gato\" González, Paul Banke, Bobby Chacon, Armando Muniz, Rene Arredondo, and Alberto Davila.\nLifetime Achievement Awards.\nThe museum also presents a lifetime achievement award. The WBC Legends of Boxing Award for Lifetime Achievement was established and sanctioned first in 2008 by Chairman Dr. Rudolph J. Tellez to honor an individual who has made significant fundamental contributions to the world of pugilism, either through a single branch of the sport or through a body of work combining different elements of boxing. These contributions, whether they have been in boxing competition, promotion, training, announcing, sports journalism, photography, leadership or mentorship, must have had a lasting impact on the boxing world and must have demonstrated a lifetime commitment to progress and promotion of the Sweet Science. The 1st Annual Lifetime Achievement Awards were presented at the 2008 WBC Legends of Boxing Museum Inaugural Induction Ceremony at the American Sports University in San Bernardino, Ca, U.S.A. on 27 June 2008. Twelve awards were given on that day and were presented to notable boxing figures such as Cleto Reyes, founder of the glove manufacturing company Industria Reyes, legendary world champion trainer Floyd Mayweather Sr., world champion trainer and manager Bennie Georgino, Ken Thompson, owner of Thompson's Boxing Promotions and former World Boxing Hall of Fame President Adolfo Perez, among others.\nHow Memorabilia is Placed into the Museum.\nItems are placed into the museum by a variety of ways. Prized personal possessions are given to the museum for enshrinement by the inducted fighter. Items can be placed into the museum by the WBC Legends of Boxing Museum Board of Directors that are deemed of significant WBC boxing value. Items can be given to the museum by family members or the managing team of a deceased past WBC champion that is receiving an award or induction. Some of the memorabilia in the museum includes; autographed gloves, autographed pictures, WBC championship belts, posters, trophies from inductees, etc.\nMemorabilia from Fighters that are on Display.\nThe museum is filled with memorabilia from past WBC champions that is showcased on standing glass cases, wall cases and more. Some of the WBC legends whose memorabilia are on display include Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, Julio Cesar Chavez, Lennox Lewis, Marco Antonio Barrera, Ken Norton, Diego Corrales, Erik Morales, Danny \"Little Red\" Lopez, Roger Mayweather, Rene Arredondo, Bobby Chacon, Salvador Sanchez, and Laila Ali among many more WBC boxing greats.\nVisiting.\nThe museum is open to the public and is free of charge. The museum welcomes all people to come view the treasures and history of the greatest WBC Champions. Special visits are available upon request and include private showings and tours for schools, boxing clubs, boxing organizations, community leaders, boxing fans, etc...\nExternal links.\n1. www.wbclegendsofboxing.com\n2. http://www.411mania.com/sports/boxing/79421/WBC-Opens-Legends-Museum.htm\n3.http://www.pound4pound.com/FightReport/2008/LegendaryTruce.htm\n4.http://www.fightnews.com/fightnews_2/headlines/EkEuuFplVlqZWnlKjn.html\n5. http://www.boxinginlasvegas.com/archives/archives_0608.htm\n6. http://www.burbankboxingclub.com/burbank_boxing_ramos.html\n7. https://web.archive.org/web/20080907184135/http://www.thesweetscience.com/boxing-article/6045/great-mando-ramos-gone/\n8. http://www.ringsidereport.com/rsr/news.php?readmore=1140\n9.http://www.pe.com/sports/boxing/stories/PE_Sports_Local_S_box_feature_08.4444397.html\n10. http://www.instantriverside.com/riverside-ca-news/west-coast-boxing-museum-opens/2008/07/08/"

This was the first rugby international to be played in Yorkshire with the game held at Cardigan Field in Leeds. Although Wales lost the match, it was a landmark game with Wales scoring their first try against England. Andrews was selected for the next match in the 1884 Home Nations Championship, seven days later, this time facing Scotland. Wales lost again, though both Scottish tries were heavily disputed.

He played all or part of four seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) between 1984 and 1988.\nNew York Mets.\nChristensen was originally drafted by the California Angels out of Troy High School in Fullerton, California in the 16th round of the 1978 MLB draft, but elected instead to attend California State University, Fullerton. The New York Mets then selected him in the second round of the 1981 MLB draft. After batting .313 at Triple-A Tidewater in 1984, he debuted with the Mets as a September call-up, batting .273 with three runs batted in and two runs scored with the big league club.\nTwo blockbuster trades.\nChristensen's numbers tailed off considerably in 1985; he batted only .212 with the Tidewater Tides, and .186 with the Mets. Following the season, the Mets traded Christensen to the Boston Red Sox along with Calvin Schiraldi, Wes Gardner and La Schelle Tarver for Bob Ojeda, Tom McCarthy, John Mitchell and Chris Bayer. After spending all of 1986 with the International League's Pawtucket Red Sox, he was sent as the player to be named later in the deal that netted Boston Dave Henderson and Spike Owen from the Seattle Mariners.\nSeattle Mariners.\nChristensen batted .385 for Seattle's double A Southern League affiliate, the Chattanooga Lookouts in 1987. However, it did not translate to major league success for him as he batted only .242 in 53 games for the M's. He was again batting .300 in the minor leagues when the Mariners released him on May 23, 1988.\nMinnesota Twins.\nOn May 28, Christensen joined the Minnesota Twins. He split the remainder of the season between the Twins, where he batted .263 in 23 games, and their top farm club, the Portland Beavers. He was released at the end of the season, but re-signed to a minor league contract. He returned to Portland, where he batted .270 in 127 games in 1989, his final professional season."

He played five seasons for the New York Giants (1932) and the Brooklyn Dodgers (1933–1937). Kelly became a player-coach and later a player/coach/owner with the Dodgers football club, the successor to the Dayton Triangles, a charter member of the NFL. He gained his nickname from Alvin \"Shipwreck\" Kelly, who was famous for pole-sitting in the 1920s.\nUniversity of Kentucky.\nKelly played college football for the Kentucky Wildcats of the University of Kentucky. In his first year on the freshman team, Kelly rode the bench most of the year. \"I knew I could play and that I could run like hell\" said Kelly. He finally got a chance against Centre in the season's final game, and scored three touchdowns. The 1929 team lost just a single game, to Wallace Wade's Alabama, a game that Kelly missed. In 1931, Kelly rushed for 1,074 yards averaging 6.3 yards per carry. He was second-team on the AP composite All-Southern team in 1930 and 1931. By Kelly's UK career's end he was dubbed \"the fastest man in the South,\" running a 100-yard dash in 9.8 seconds.\nNFL.\nAt age 23, Kelly became a player/coach and later a player/coach/owner with the Dodgers football club, which he bought with a partner, Dan Topping. Kelly ran back the team's punts. He also led the league in receptions in 1933.\nPersonal life.\nKelly was a part of New York's cafe society and was frequently in attendance at the Stork Club, \"21\", and El Morocco.\nKelly was married in 1941, in New York City, to the \"Millionaire Debutante\" Brenda Frazier, after whom the long-running comic strip \"Brenda Starr, Reporter\" was named. The couple bought a new Packard Darrin convertible from the New York Auto Show, and travelled around New York City with people such as Jock Whitney and Tom Kerrigan. They were married for fifteen years, and had one daughter, Brenda Victoria. In 1956, he married Catherine Hannon. They had a son, John Kelly, who took part in the 1980 Winter Olympics.\nKelly was a relative of former New York Giants quarterback Phil Simms.\nWorld War II.\nDuring World War II, Kelly was recruited by the FBI to travel to Cuba, Mexico, Peru, Chile and Argentina to track the activities of wealthy German expatriates helping the Nazi cause.\nAfter the war, Kelly pursued a career as an investment banker, Florida real estate investor and became a champion amateur golfer. He played golf with the Duke of Windsor and Richard Nixon. He was also a big game hunter. He died of a stroke at age 76 and is buried in his home town of Simstown, Kentucky."

        "text": "The 2009 Major League Baseball season began on April 5, 2009; the regular season was extended two days for a one-game playoff between the Detroit Tigers and the Minnesota Twins for the American League Central title. The postseason began the next day with the Division Series. The World Series began on October 28, and ended on November 4, with the New York Yankees defeating the Philadelphia Phillies in six games. This was the second time the season was completed in November. The only other occasion was the 2001 World Series, because of the delaying of the end of that season due to the September 11 attacks as November baseball would be guaranteed when Game 4 was played on Sunday, November 1. Had the 2009 World Series gone the full seven games, Game 7 would've been played on November 5, the latest date ever scheduled for a World Series game. It became the latest date for a World Series game in 2022. The American League champion had home field advantage for the World Series by virtue of winning the All-Star Game on July 14 at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri, 4–3. In addition, the annual Civil Rights Game became a regular season game, and was played June 20 at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati, Ohio, when the host Cincinnati Reds lost to the Chicago White Sox in an interleague game, 10–8. Both teams wore replicas of their 1965 uniforms in the contest.\nPostseason.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket/&gt;\n&lt;section end=Bracket/&gt;\nNote: Two teams in the same division could not meet in the division series.\nManaging changes.\nGeneral managers.\nThe Seattle Mariners named Milwaukee Brewers scouting director Jack Zduriencik its new general manager on October 22, replacing interim GM Lee Pelekoudas.\nWashington Nationals GM Jim Bowden resigned on March 1 amid allegations that he was skimming bonus money from Latin American players. Team president Stan Kasten first took over the bulk of his duties before transferring them to assistant GM Mike Rizzo, who had served as acting GM, and was named as the full-time general manager on August 20.\nDuring the last days of the regular season, two teams fired their general managers, effective at the end of the season. On October 3, the Toronto Blue Jays fired J. P. Ricciardi after eight seasons. The following day, the San Diego Padres axed Kevin Towers, who had been the longest-tenured GM in Major League Baseball at 14 seasons.\nField managers.\nOff-season changes.\nTwo teams announced new managers in the offseason:\nCito Gaston and Jerry Manuel both entered their first full season as managers of the Toronto Blue Jays and New York Mets, respectively, after taking over for managers dismissed in the middle of the 2008 season. Gaston had previously been the Blue Jays' manager from 1989 until 1997.\nRule changes.\nOn January 15, the owners of the 30 Major League Baseball clubs approved two rule changes governing the playing of postseason and one-game playoff games.\nNew stadiums.\nThe 2009 season marked the opening of two new stadiums, both in New York City; Citi Field for the Mets and the new Yankee Stadium for the Yankees. They respectively replaced Shea Stadium (which was dismantled during the 2008–09 offseason) and the original Yankee Stadium (which became a public park after its demolition). Because of the smaller seating capacities in these new parks, Dodger Stadium is now the largest capacity park in use with 56,000 seats, and is also the third oldest ballpark in Major League Baseball behind Fenway Park and Wrigley Field. Citi Field opened with a night game on April 13 as the Mets hosted the San Diego Padres losing 6–5. In that game, Jody Gerut of the Padres became the first player in major league history to open a new ballpark with a leadoff homer. Three days later, the Cleveland Indians inaugurated New Yankee Stadium against the Bronx Bombers. The Indians won 10–2. On Jackie Robinson Day (April 15), a rotunda at Citi Field was named in honor of Jackie Robinson and was dedicated prior to the Mets–Padres game that day.\nThe 2009 season also marked the final season of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome as the home for the Minnesota Twins, where they had played since 1982. In 2010, the team moved to Target Field, their new baseball-only stadium located a short distance across town. Previously, since moving from in 1961, the franchise has shared, first Metropolitan Stadium, and then the Metrodome with the NFL's Minnesota Vikings; they also shared tenant rights at the Metrodome with the University of Minnesota's football team. The Golden Gophers started to play on-campus at TCF Bank Stadium in 2009. The Metrodome's last scheduled regular season game was to be played on Sunday, October 4, 2009, but the Twins tied the Detroit Tigers necessitating a one-game playoff between the two teams on October 6.\nWhile not a new stadium, Kansas City's Kauffman Stadium completed a two-year renovation. The first year saw a new video board dubbed \"Crown Vision\" and refitting of several sections. Improvements for 2009 include a new glass and brick facade to the exterior of the ballpark, newly expanded team Hall of Fame, a new sports bar/restaurant, improved sightlines, new luxury suites and refurbished press and radio/TV facilities to name a few.\nIn late March, the Florida Marlins had their funding for a new stadium at the former site of the Miami Orange Bowl approved by Miami-Dade County commissioners. Groundbreaking ceremonies were held on July 18, with an opening by 2012, at which time the team will be renamed the Miami Marlins.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nThis would have marked the first full season in the US for baseball games to be telecast as the transition from analog to digital television that was to have been made on February 17. However, the transition took place June 12.\nA new entrant in the baseball television rights marketplace debuted on January 1 when the MLB Network, owned by Major League Baseball, joined Fox, ESPN and TBS not only televising games, but also other baseball-related programming from their studio in Secaucus, New Jersey, formerly the studios of MSNBC. MLB was the last of the four major team sports to start its own television channel. The national telecast breakdown, along with the maximum number of appearances per team, is:\nIn Canada, Toronto Blue Jays games will be televised on Rogers Sportsnet and TSN. RSN also holds the Canadian rights to air the Fox and ESPN/ESPN2 games if they do not conflict with Blue Jays games, as well as the All-Star Game and the entire postseason.\nIn Australia free to air channel One HD shows up to 5 games live per week, and European channel ESPN America broadcasts games as well.\nRadio.\nESPN Radio served as MLB's national radio network, broadcasting \"Sunday Night Baseball\" as well as selected Saturday and holiday games during the regular season, the Home Run Derby and All-Star Game, and all postseason series.\nUniforms, patches, and caps.\nPatches.\nAs stated earlier, the Mets and Yankees wore patches commemorating the inaugural seasons of their new parks, the Twins wore patches commemorating their final season at the Metrodome, and the Cardinals, hosting the All-Star Game, wore a patch to celebrate that event.\nOther teams' memorials and accomplishments on their sleeves:\nUniforms.\nTurn Back The Clock.\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates, Detroit Tigers, Oakland Athletics and Chicago White Sox led the Majors in wearing throwback uniforms. On May 2 at Safeco Field, the Athletics and Seattle Mariners honored 1939 by wearing special uniforms. The Mariners honored the Seattle Rainiers and the Oakland Athletics honored the Oakland Oaks from that season. Both teams played in the Pacific Coast League that season. The A's then wore a 1980s styled uniform in St. Petersburg on July 11 against the Tampa Bay Rays, who wore uniforms from their inaugural season of 1998 when they were known as the \"Devil Rays\". Finally, On August 16, the Athletics and White Sox used vintage throwbacks. The A's wore uniforms from their Philadelphia period, with blue caps and a large A on the front of their jerseys. The White Sox wore their jerseys with a large S with a lowercase O in the top loop and a lowercase X in the bottom loop.\nOn June 14, the Tigers and Pirates wore throwback uniforms to commemorate the 100th anniversary of both Forbes Field and the 1909 World Series between the two teams. That game also featured a throwback atmosphere: no music or flashy graphics, no mascots (meaning no Jolly Roger or Pirate Parrot), and a hand-operated scoreboard. One modern item occurred in the pre-game: The Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins made a surprise visit and brought the trophy with them. The Pirates and the Kansas City Royals also honored the Negro leagues on June 26 and 27 with the Pirates wearing the Homestead Grays uniforms and the Royals donning Kansas City Monarchs replicas. The Pirates and the Cincinnati Reds recreated their 1979 National League Championship Series uniforms on August 21 as part of the Buccos' 30th anniversary celebration of their World Series championship. The Bucs wore their gold pillbox hat with a gold jersey and black pants, a faux pas from the uniforms that season as a black cap was worn that year with the gold jersey.\nIn addition to the aforementioned Civil Rights Game and game in Oakland, the White Sox, originators of the genre of replica throwback uniforms, commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of their 1959 American League Championship on June 25 against the team that they played in that World Series, the Los Angeles Dodgers, who opted to wear their regular uniforms instead, as manager Joe Torre did not want to create hype of a World Series that was 50 years ago.\nThe Tigers and the Cleveland Indians played in Negro league replicas twice, with the Tigers in Detroit Stars uniforms, and the Indians outfitted in Cleveland Buckeyes replicas. In a \"home-and-home\" style series, the Tigers hosting the Tribe July 11 at Comerica Park, with the Tigers in 1920 Stars uniforms and the Indians in the 1948 Buckeyes road grays, while the Indians played host August 1 at Progressive Field seeing Cleveland wearing Buckeyes home whites and the Tigers in the gray Stars uniform."

He played for Manly-Warringah and Eastern Suburbs and coached the Gold Coast Seagulls and the Salford City Reds. Harvey primarily played at .\nPlaying career.\nHarvey was a Manly junior who grew into a hard-hitting prop with a reputation for a high-arm action when making a shoulder charge. Harvey played in two grand-finals while at Manly, in the 1976 win over Parramatta. Harvey was selected to represent Australia for one Test in 1978 against New Zealand but spent the whole game on the interchange bench. He played in the 1978 NSWRFL season's Grand Final draw and subsequent win over Cronulla-Sutherland. Harvey had a further chance that year to play in an international when he was selected for the 1978 Kangaroo tour, but he created some controversy when he declined the selection due to personal reasons.\nAfter receiving an offer which doubled his Manly pay-packet, Harvey signed with Easts in 1979. He played in Easts losing 1980 grand final side and remained with the club until the end of 1982 when he \"went bush\". In 1983, Harvey captain-coached the Tweed Heads Seagulls for a season, winning the Group 18 premiership as well as the Country Rugby League's Clayton Cup.\nBob Fulton made Harvey an offer to return to Manly in 1984 but his playing contract wasn't extended for the following season and Harvey returned to country football once more.\nHarvey continued to play in NSW country leagues until 1992, with seasons at Forster-Tuncurry Hawks, Tweed Heads Seagulls and Wee Waa. He captain-coached the Tweed Head Seagulls to another Clayton Cup win in 1989. Harvey finished his playing career at Wee Waa, leading the team to a grand final victory in the Group 4 competition at the age of 37.\nCoaching career.\nHarvey returned to the Gold Coast as coach of the Seagulls in 1994, succeeding Wally Lewis, who had held the post for the previous two seasons. The club undertook new ownership in 1996, being rebranded as the Gold Coast Chargers, and Phil Economidis took over from Harvey as coach.\nIn May 1999, Harvey replaced Andy Gregory as head coach at the Salford City Reds in the Super League. After the club avoided relegation at the end of the 1999 season, Harvey was given a contract for a further season."

        "title": "Baseball Before We Knew It",
        "text": "Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game is a 2005 book by David Block about the history of baseball. Block looks into the early history of baseball, the debates about baseball's beginnings, and presents new evidence. The book received the 2006 Seymour Medal from the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR).\nThe account, first published in 1905, that Abner Doubleday invented baseball in 1839 was once widely promoted and widely believed. However, this belief was discredited almost immediately. Although the Doubleday myth was never taken seriously by historians, Block showed that the narrative that supplanted it was also deeply flawed. In this accounting, baseball was understood as the derivation of an English children's game, rounders, but America was allowed to retain patrimony over its national pastime through the assertion that it had been reinvented as a modern sport by the members of the New York Knickerbockers, who codified its rules for the first time in 1845. This idea, according to Block is wrong in almost every aspect. In the book, Block argues that baseball was not a product of rounders, and its essential form had already been established by the late 18th century.\nBlock's new evidence in the matter includes the first known record of the term \"base-ball\" in the United States. It came in a 1791 ordinance in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, that banned ballplaying near the town's new meetinghouse. However, that was not the first appearance of \"base-ball\" in print. That distinction belongs to an English book, \"A Little Pretty Pocket-Book\" (1744). By 1796 the rules of this English game were well enough established to earn a mention in German scholar Johann Gutsmuths book on popular pastimes, that described \"Englische Base-ball\" involved a contest between two teams, in which \"the batter has three attempts to hit the ball while at the home plate\"; only one out was required to retire a side. The book also predates the rules laid out by the New York Knickerbockers by nearly fifty years. In the book, Block suggests that it was the English game of baseball that had arrived in the U.S. as part of \"a sweeping tide of cultural migration\" during the colonial period. Once on American soil, the game developed popular regional variations that included \"town-ball\", \"round-ball\" and the \"New York game\".\nEnglish baseball was itself the product of a prolonged, nonlinear evolution. \"Tut-ball\" may have been its immediate predecessor. \"Stool-ball\", an earlier sport, may have been even more influential in the evolution of baseball, and is also a likely parent of cricket, which developed independently. Medieval texts also suggest that baseball's English antecedents may themselves have descended from Continental bat-and-ball games. An illustration in the French manuscript \"The Romance of Alexander\" (1344) depicts a group of monks and nuns engaged in a game, thought to be \"la soule\", that looks much like co-ed softball. Two other French games, \"théque\" and \"la balle empoisonée\" (\"poisoned ball\"), also bear similarities to early baseball. They could have migrated to England. In Block's words, the field is clear for the French to claim \"parental rights over America's National Game.\"\nBlock also notes in the book that American researchers during the past half-century \"have made only minimal effort to document baseball's early history and for the most part have not been inclined to go looking to European sources for clues.\""

The club had been established in the 18th century and it first came to notice in 1800 when it played the strong Montpelier team. In 1801, Homerton defeated Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's Old Ground by 181 runs.\nHomerton's first important match was in June 1804 when a combined MCC/Homerton XI lost to Hampshire at Lord's by 6 wkts.\nHomerton's period of renown ended in 1808 when, despite four given men, the team was well-beaten by MCC in its last important match. In the same year, Homerton lost twice to an Essex XI in minor matches.\nThe club disappeared from the sources after 1808 and disbanded at some point. It must have lost personnel to military duties in the Napoleonic War which had a disastrous impact on cricket at the time.\nHomerton Cricket Club was reconstituted in 2012 under Gary Horsman, then president of Chats Palace CC. The reconstitution was agreed at an extraordinary AGM and formalised by a unanimous vote carrying the motion forward. The club plays fixtures in and around Hackney and is a founding member of the Victoria Park Community Cricket League."

        "text": "Anna Smith (born 14 August 1988) is a British former professional tennis player.\nShe won one doubles title on the WTA Tour, as well as five singles and 29 doubles titles on the ITF Women's Circuit.\nSmith, who specialised in doubles, was coached by Dave Sammel at TeamBath.\nEarly and personal life.\nShe was born in Redhill, Surrey, to Robert and Gunilla Smith and started playing tennis at the age of ten.\nCareer.\nJunior (2003–2006).\nSmith first competed as a junior in February 2003 and her last junior tournament was in June 2006 in the qualifying draw for the Wimbledon juniors. She had limited success as a singles player; she reached only one final (in April 2006 at the Sutton ITF junior tournament where she was beaten by Naomi Broady) and did not reach the quarterfinals in any other tournament she played.\nShe had significantly more success as a junior doubles competitor, winning three titles at the Donnybrook Junior International, the Wrexham and the Nottingham ITF event. She also reached two more finals, four semifinals and one quarterfinal.\nOver the three years of her junior career, she reached a career-high combined ranking of world No. 665 and accumulated win–loss records of 8–13 in singles and 24–10 in doubles.\n2004–2007.\nSmith played her first professional match in July 2004, courtesy of a wildcard into the qualifying draw of the $10k tournament in Felixstowe, England. Following two wins, she lost in the final round of qualifying to Lena Keothavong, the younger sister of top-100 player Anne Keothavong. Smith then lost in the qualifying stages of the $10k tournament in Manchester before going to Bolton and winning two matches to qualify for the $10k tournament held there. In her first main draw match of her career, she lost to a fellow British Elizabeth Thomas. She finished 2004 without a world ranking.\nIn April 2005, Smith lost in the final round of qualifying for the $10k in Porto Santo, Portugal, but was given a chance in the main draw as a lucky loser. She played well in this tournament before having to withdraw in the quarterfinals. August brought two more quarterfinal losses for Smith, the first in the $10k Wrexham tournament and the second in the $10k Nottingham tournament. The Wrexham event also saw her claim her first professional title as she won the doubles in partnership with Rebecca Llewellyn. Her final tournament of the year was the $10k event in Sunderland, where she also reached the quarterfinals. She finished 2005 ranked world No. 660.\nApril and May 2006 saw good form from Smith; in April, she reached the first ITF Circuit semifinal of her career in Bath, Somerset and the following month she reached the quarterfinals in Bournemouth. In August, she reached the first singles final of her career in Ilkley, not dropping a single set en route. She was beaten in the title match by Anna Fitzpatrick. Smith managed to reach the quarterfinals as a qualifier in her very next tournament ($10k Wrexham). In September, she won her first professional singles title at the $10k event in Nottingham beating compatriot Georgie Stoop in the final. The rest of the year saw limited success for Smith in singles, though she did win a doubles title in Redbridge with Anna Hawkins.\nIn March 2007, Smith reached the third singles final of her career at a $10k event in Hamilton, New Zealand, where she lost to Erika Sema. She got no more notable results until August that year when she hit another good patch, reaching the semifinal of the $10k event in London before losing to Martina Babáková. Smith and Babáková also won the doubles in London. In her next tournament, a $10k event in Nottingham, Smith reached the final which she lost to Pauline Wong. She then immediately followed this up by qualifying for and reaching the quarterfinals of the $25k event, also held in Nottingham. The rest of the year was spent on the ITF Circuit but she lost before the quarterfinals in every tournament. Her end-of-year ranking was world No. 449.\n2008.\n2008 started disappointingly for Smith as she only managed to reach one ITF quarterfinal before entering the qualifying event for Wimbledon where she won one match (against Julie Coin of France) before losing in the second round. Later that year she won the second ITF title of her career, this time at the $10k event in London. She beat Rebecca Marino in the final. She then reached the semifinals in Limoges, France – another $10k event. In October, she reached the quarterfinals of a $50k home event in Barnstaple before losing to Lina Stančiūtė. Her year-end ranking was 373.\n2009.\nIn her new season she won only one match out of her first eleven, before going on to take the title in Felixstowe in July, beating Heather Watson in the semifinals and Tímea Babos in the final. In her next tournament, another $10k in Frinton, she again came up against Watson in the semifinals but was defeated in straight sets. After this she reached only one more quarterfinal for the rest of the year in Koksijde where she lost to Sofia Shapatava. By the end of 2009, her singles ranking had fallen to No. 441.\n2017.\nSmith won her first WTA Tour title when she and Nicole Melichar beat Kirsten Flipkens and Johanna Larsson in Nuremberg.\n2018.\nIn February, Smith was selected for the Fed Cup Europe/Africa Zone Group I matches in Estonia. Playing doubles with Katie Boulter, they won both of their dead pool rubbers against Estonia and Portugal. With Great Britain in the playoffs, Johanna Konta and Heather Watson won their singles matches against Hungary, Great Britain progressed to the World Group II Play-offs, and the doubles match was not played.\nFed Cup participation.\nGreat Britain Fed Cup team"

        "title": "Pat Devlin (American football)",
        "text": "Patrick Ryan Devlin (born April 12, 1988) is a former American football quarterback. Following a stint with Penn State, he played college football at Delaware, and was signed by the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL) as an undrafted free agent in 2011.\nDevlin went on to join the Minnesota Vikings, where he was a member of the practice squad, and trained with the Chicago Bears and the Cleveland Browns in 2015, before signing with the Browns as a back-up later that year. In his five seasons in the NFL, he did not take a single snap.\nHigh school career.\nAt Downingtown East High School, Devlin set the Pennsylvania high school career passing yards record with 8,162 career yards. He became a highly touted recruit, and although he verbally committed to the University of Miami, he eventually announced that he would be attending Pennsylvania State University to play for the Nittany Lions.\nCollege career.\nPenn State.\n2007.\nAfter redshirting the 2006 season, Devlin was listed as the third-string quarterback behind Anthony Morelli and Daryll Clark in 2007. Devlin saw action in games against Florida International, Wisconsin and Temple, but accumulated few statistics.\n2008.\nIn the weeks leading up to the start of the 2008 season, controversy swirled around the Nittany Lions' starting quarterback position. Daryll Clark, the more experienced and agile quarterback was being weighed against the younger, more prolific passing threat in Devlin. In the end, Penn State coach Joe Paterno chose to start Clark, while having him split as much time with Devlin as would be possible. Lopsided victories in the first four games of the 2008 season provided Devlin with much playing time. In games against Coastal Carolina, Oregon State, Syracuse and Temple, Devlin threw for 260 yards and was 18 of 35. When Clark was forced out in the fourth quarter of the Nittany Lions' crucial game against Ohio State due to a concussion, Devlin led the team on a go-ahead drive that was culminated by his own 1-yard touchdown run. He also had some playing time against Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana and Michigan State. Devlin appeared in ten games for the Nittany Lions, passing for 459 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions.\nDevlin decided to transfer from Penn State prior to the 2009 Rose Bowl.\nDelaware.\n2009.\nDevlin signed with the University of Delaware on February 4, 2009 to play for the Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens football team.\nDevlin led the 2009 squad to a 6–5 record. Devlin started all eleven games for the Blue Hens, passing for 2,664 yards, sixteen touchdowns, and nine interceptions. In the final game of the season against Villanova, Devlin passed for Delaware school records in completions (42) and attempts (58) and threw for 407 yards. Devlin was named the Colonial Athletic Association Football Offensive Player of the Week twice during the season, and led the league in passing average per game (242.2 yards) and total offense per game (253.7 yards). He also was honored as the Eastern College Athletic Conference Division I – Championship Subdivision Offensive Player of the Week.\nThe Sports Network wrote that \"Devlin has put some teeth back into the Blue Hen passing attack with his accurate throws and on-field leadership\", and included him as a finalist in the voting for the 2009 Walter Payton Award, given to the most outstanding offensive player in the Division I Football Championship Subdivision (formerly Division I-AA). In November 2009, Devlin was honored as the local College Player of the Year by the Eagles Fly for Leukemia program, an organization supporting pediatric cancer and leukemia research in the Delaware Valley.\n2010.\nIn June, Devlin was selected to the Consensus Draft Services Pre-Season NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision pre-season honorable mention All-American. The team is made up of players at the FCS level who the CDS staff predicts will be among the top players in the nation and have a chance to be selected in the National Football League Draft in April 2011. In July, Devlin was placed on the watchlists for the Walter Payton Award and the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award.\nIn the season's first game against West Chester, Devlin completed 14 of 23 passes for 163 yards with three touchdown passes to lead the team to a 31–0 shutout. Although Devlin fractured a bone in his non-throwing wrist in the first quarter of the game against South Dakota State, he played through the middle of the fourth quarter. Although cleared to play the following week against Duquesne, Devlin stood on the sidelines. Devlin came back the following week with a big second-half win against Richmond, but was knocked out of the following week's game against James Madison with a concussion. Back at home against Maine, Devlin completed 20 of 36 passes for 286 yards, leading the Blue Hens to their sixth win of the season. After a close win against Rhode Island and a one-point loss against William &amp; Mary, he dominated against Towson, completing 29 of 38 passes for 318 yards and one touchdown while running for another score. Devlin became the ninth Delaware player to pass for over 4,000 yards in a career. Against UMass, Devlin completed 16 of 22 passes for 240 yards, four touchdowns and a interception in a 45–27 win. Delaware were briefly ranked No. 1, before losing to rivals Villanova 28–21 in overtime, with Devlin completing 30 of 45 passes for 305 yards and three touchdowns.\nIn the post-season, Delaware had a first round bye, and in the second round, they defeated Lehigh 42–20, with Devlin completing 19 of 26 passes for 256 yards and four touchdowns. In the quarter-finals, they defeated New Hampshire 16–3, and Devlin completed 27 of 38 passes for 261 yards and two touchdowns. In the semi-final, they defeated Georgia Southern 27–10, and Devlin completed 14 of 20 passes for 137 yards and two touchdowns. In the NCAA Division I Football Championship Game, Devlin completed 22 of 34 passes for 220 yards, but threw an interception as Delaware lost the game 20–19 to Eastern Washington. His performances during the season saw him being named the Colonial Athletic Association Player of the Year.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nDevlin entered the 2011 NFL Draft and was regarded as one of the top ten quarterbacks entering the draft by NFL Network analyst Mike Mayock, but was not drafted. He was targeted as the first overall pick in the 2011 UFL Draft, but declined to sign a mandatory contract.\nMiami Dolphins.\nDevlin was signed by the Miami Dolphins as an undrafted free agent on July 26, 2011. He was waived after the preseason, but signed with the team's practice squad. He was promoted to the team's active roster on December 20. In the 2012 season, he remained the Dolphins' third-string quarterback by beating out David Garrard, and in the 2013 season, he made the 53-man team, after wide receiver Marvin McNutt was released. During the Dolphins' 2014 preseason, Devlin injured his hamstring, and on August 11, 2014, he was waived in favor of signing Brady Quinn.\nMinnesota Vikings.\nDevlin was signed to the Minnesota Vikings practice squad on November 3, 2014. On April 2, 2015, Devlin was waived by the Vikings.\nChicago Bears.\nDevlin was signed to the Chicago Bears on May 11, 2015. On June 18, 2015, he was waived by the Bears.\nCleveland Browns.\nDevlin was signed to the Cleveland Browns on August 27, 2015. He was released by the Browns on September 5, 2015. On December 31, 2015, Devlin was re-signed by the Browns to be back-up to Austin Davis, after it was determined Johnny Manziel would not play due to his status in the NFL concussion protocol. He was not re-signed by the Browns going into the 2016 season, as the franchise moved on from Manziel and brought in Robert Griffin III as their preferred starting quarterback.\nPersonal life.\nDevlin is married to Tristin Jones, with whom he has three children. He is a nephew of former Buffalo Bills offensive tackle Joe Devlin. "

        "title": "2008 Vuelta a España, Stage 1 to Stage 11",
        "text": "These are the individual stages of the 2008 Vuelta a España, with Stage 1 on 30 August and Stage 11 on 10 September.\nStages.\nStage 1.\n30 August 2008 – Granada, 7 km (TTT)\nThe 2008 Vuelta began with a short team time trial over a perfectly flat course in the city of Granada.\nThe Italian team was the unexpected winner of the team time trial. They finished in 8' 21\", more than ten seconds clear of the supposed favorites and . also finished well; the Basques were eight seconds back of Liquigas at the end, for second place, despite having the best time at the intermediate time check. Filippo Pozzato donned the first golden jersey at the head of the General classification.\nStage 2.\n31 August 2008 – Granada to Jaén, 167 km \nThe first regular stage of the Vuelta included its first climb, the third category hill at Las Encebras, and featured a 25 kilometer circuit in the city of Jaén before the finish. The cyclists took two laps of this circuit before the final finishing line. It was thought that it would ensure a sprint finish.\nJust as he had in the Tour de France earlier in the season, Alejandro Valverde won the first regular stage of the Vuelta. The successful breakaway of the day involved Jesús Rosendo, Egoi Martínez, Cyril Lemoine, and Mikhail Ignatiev. They held a maximum advantage of 4' 30\" on the main field, but were caught 20 kilometers before the finish. Valverde's Caisse d'Epargne teammates successfully cracked the main field on the way into Jaén, launching attacks that kept anyone but Valverde going clear, as he did, with a 2 second advantage on the field. Thanks to that and time bonuses at the line, Valverde took the overall lead in the race.\nStage 3.\n1 September 2008 – Jaén to Córdoba, 168 km \nThis stage was gently undulating until the third category climb up San Jerónimo, which began 26 kilometers from the finish line. It was thought that this might break up the field and keep a mass sprint from happening, which partially came true.\nAndalucía-Cajasur rider Manuel Ortega broke away from the main field almost immediately after the official start of the stage. Alone, he held a maximum advantage of over 15 minutes before the pack, paced by the race leader's team Caisse d'Epargne, began to draw him back. Their pace was extremely lax, slower than the slowest predicted team by the Vuelta's organizers, but eventually they did begin to reel Ortega in. Liquigas later came forward to set a faster pace, one that cracked about a third of the field on the way up the Alto de San Jerónimo climb. A breakaway led by Paolo Bettini caught Ortega with 17 kilometers to go, but Bettini's breakaway itself was caught 4 kilometers in front of the line. A bunched sprint saw Tom Boonen win the stage. With bonus seconds won for second place at the line and in intermediate sprints, Daniele Bennati became the third golden jersey wearer in as many days.\nStage 4.\n2 September 2008 – Córdoba to Puertollano, 170 km \nThis stage saw the riders leave the autonomous community of Andalusia and enter Castile-La Mancha. There were two third-category climbs along the way, but the final 60 kilometers were almost perfectly flat, and a bunched sprint finish was expected.\nAn Andalucía-Cajasur rider again launched a solo attack that kept him out in front of the field for most of the day. For this stage, that rider was José Antonio López, who broke away at the 9 kilometer mark and attained a maximum advantage of 8' 06\" as the bunch took it easy for the first two and a half hours before finally increasing their speed. The field was paced by the race leader's team Liquigas as well as the team of the man who won the stage the previous day and poised to do so again, Tom Boonen's Quick Step mates. López held on as long as he could, and was caught at the 8 kilometers to go mark. Another classic sprint finish saw the stage victory go to race leader Daniele Bennati. A crash at the 3 kilometers to go mark fractured the field and limited the riders who could contest the finish to those already at the front of the pack. While a crash within the final 3 kilometers normally affords everyone involved the same finishing time as the one attained by the group they were in upon crashing, race officials later declared that this crash took place just outside 3 kilometers from the line, and all time lost by those involved would stand as time lost.\nStage 5.\n3 September 2008 – Ciudad Real, 42 km (ITT)\nThe first individual time trial of the Vuelta took place on a completely flat course in Ciudad Real. It was predicted that the winner would have an average of speed of over 50 km/h.\nThe early time to beat was set by Manuel Quinziato of Liquigas, blowing away the times that had come before him by more than a minute. Around an hour after Quinziato's ride, a pack of General classification favorites took the course, and the first of them, Astana's Levi Leipheimer, clocked in 33 seconds better than Quinziato, and held on to win the stage as well as the next golden jersey. The only other man to beat Quinziato on the day was something of a surprise, Sylvain Chavanel of Cofidis, who is not normally known, in international competition, for his time trialling skills. The other contenders all turned in strong rides, leaving the GC tightly bunched with the Pyrenees looming.\nStage 6.\n4 September 2008 – Ciudad Real to Toledo, 150 km\nIn what was the last stage branded as flat before the Vuelta entered the mountains, there was one third-category climb 50 kilometers before the finish. After that peak, there was a sharp descent and a flat section with two intermediate sprints before the altitude dropped again in the city of Toledo. The finish was on a slight uphill, which was thought to test the sprinters' limits in what was expected nonetheless to be a mass finish.\nThe day's successful breakaway formed after about 7 kilometers, involving Iban Mayoz, Mikhail Ignatiev, and Volodymyr Dyudya. The team that paced the pack in efforts to bring them back was Cofidis, looking to have one solid group at the intermediate sprints later in the course so Sylvain Chavanel could make up the 2 second gap he had to race leader Levi Leipheimer. There was a big crash in the pack at the 68 kilometer mark, mostly involving riders from Silence-Lotto, Quick Step, Xacobeo-Galicia, and Bouygues Télécom, as well as Alejandro Valverde and Tom Boonen, who later called on the race doctor for some medical attention. The Cofidis-paced main field caught the break at the 108 kilometer mark, just after the one categorized climb of the day and just before the intermediate sprints. Shortly afterward, the blistering pace set by Cofidis, along with some crosswinds, led to another crash, at the 112 kilometer mark. Chavanel won the two intermediate sprints and became the new overall leader of the Vuelta on the road, thanks to the twelve bonus seconds he won with them. Numerous riders attacked on the way into Toledo and a pack led by Paolo Bettini, who won the sprint to the line, was the successful one. The field in fact fractured quite a bit - there were six large groups separated, collectively, by less than a minute at the end of the stage.\nRest day.\n5 September 2008\nStage 7.\n6 September 2008 – Barbastro to Naturlandia-La Rabassa (Andorra), 223 km\nThe longest stage of the 2008 Vuelta, as well as one of the most mountainous, the first action after the rest day was a stern test for the riders. There were four categorized climbs along the way, one each in the first, second, and third categories with a special category climb at the finish in Andorra making this stage a playground for riders who like to battle gravity.\nThis day belonged to Alessandro Ballan. He was part of a five-man group, along with Marc de Maar, Iñigo Landaluze, Gianni Meersman, and Xabier Zandio, that broke away at the 18 kilometer mark, and stayed out in front of the field all day to claim the stage win. He had other prizes awaiting him at the podium in Andorra, namely the golden jersey (giving the Vuelta its sixth different overall leader in seven stages), the red jersey, and the white jersey. He was also only 7 points shy of claiming the blue jersey. The route was marked by terrible weather, in particular rain and cold temperatures, which Ballan would later say helped him win, in that he is accustomed to such weather living in northern Italy.\nThe lead Ballan's breakaway had over the pack grew to a maximum of just under eleven minutes before Astana, the team of GC hopefuls Levi Leipheimer and Alberto Contador, took the pace of the main field to try to reel them in. Their pace was so blisteringly fast that it cracked more than two-thirds of the field, members of which dropped as much as thirty minutes behind them. When Astana ratcheted up its speed, the breakaway did as well, as Zandio was dropped, falling minutes behind them. Ballan attacked from his group and got free at the 14 kilometers to go mark and quickly attained a lead of two minutes over the other three, staying out front to win the stage. The elite main group led by Astana caught the other members of the day's breakaway, and attacked and jockeyed for position at the finish some three minutes behind Ballan.\nStage 8.\n7 September 2008 – Escaldes-Engordany (Andorra) to Plá de Beret, 151 km\nThis short, yet extremely mountainous, stage was thought to invite many early attacks, as the race re-entered Spain. There were three first category climbs on the course, and the finish was on a slight downhill after the Alto de Plá de Beret. This stage also featured the highest point in the 2008 Vuelta, the first-category Port de la Bonaigua, at 2,070 meters in elevation.\nMany riders attempted to break away from the pack from the outset, but no one was successful until an hour had been spent in the saddle and 38 kilometers covered. The five that broke free were Christophe Kern, Nikita Eskov, Juan Manuel Gárate, Sébastien Joly, and David Moncoutié. Their lead quickly rose to three minutes as Garate was the first over the first-category climb El Cantó. It held steady until the category two climb up Eviny 27 kilometers later, and then grew to a maximum of 5' 30\" before Astana, again, was the team to come forward to pace the main field. Astana's sporting director Johan Bruyneel explained that this was more to keep things steady, after the race leader's team Lampre dropped off the pace, than to bring the breakaway back, since no one in it was a GC threat.\nThe autobus formed going up the Puerto de la Bonaigua as Andreas Klöden set an extremely fast pace. Among the many riders to fall into the autobus was race leader Alessandro Ballan. In short order, Levi Leipheimer effectively became the new race leader on the road, as Ballan dropped well back of the main field, which caught every breakaway rider except Moncoutié before the summit of the Bonaigua. Though his advantage continued to shrink, Moncoutié managed to stay out front just long enough to win the stage, with the main chase group, an elite bunch of a dozen or so riders who were able to take Klöden's pace, 34 seconds back. Alejandro Valverde and Alberto Contador traded repeated attacks on the way up to Plá de Beret, gaining themselves as well as Igor Antón five potentially valuable seconds over other contenders such as Leipheimer, Carlos Sastre, and Ezequiel Mosquera. Valverde and Contador went on to don leader's jerseys after the stage, Valverde the blue points jersey and Contador the white combined classification jersey.\nStage 9.\n8 September 2008 – Vielha e Mijaran to Sabiñánigo, 200 km\nThis stage was thought to see a winning breakaway, and did. There were four categorized climbs along the way, including the first-category Puerto de Serrablo 66 kilometers before the finish, to keep the teams of the sprinters from taking control of the race.\nBeing faced almost immediately with the second-category Alto del Túnel and, not long after, the second-category Coll de l'Espina, no breakaway came successfully clear of the bunch for over an hour. When David Moncoutié topped l'Espina in first position, he took over the King of the Mountains lead from Alessandro Ballan. He later cemented this by topping the Puerto de Serrablo in first place as well.\nThe race leader's team Astana again set a very fast pace at the head of the main field, such that it fractured into three large groups, with all the major GC contenders in the first group. Finally, after 60 kilometers and close to two hours in the saddle, a 12-man group broke free, attaining an advantage of close to seven minutes. The best-placed man in the breakaway, Euskaltel-Euskadi rider Egoi Martínez, threatened the overall lead of Levi Leipheimer as he was 6' 41\" back at the beginning of the day. Team CSC Saxo Bank and Caisse d'Epargne tried to pull the main field along fast enough so that the time gap to the breakaway would be small enough that Leipheimer's Astana Team would have to work to keep him in gold, but the strategy didn't work. Astana eventually retook the pace and willfully let the time gap go low enough so that when all was done at the day's end, Martínez had taken enough time back to become the new holder of the golden jersey. This move was criticized the next day by several local newspapers.\nEleven of the riders in the breakaway finished in Sabiñánigo together, and the sprint to the line was won by Silence-Lotto rider Greg Van Avermaet. The main field, which had consolidated to almost all other riders in the race, finished 6' 42\" back (Martínez also gained bonus seconds in intermediate sprints, leading to his 11 second lead in the GC after this stage).\nStage 10.\n9 September 2008 – Sabiñánigo to Zaragoza, 151 km\nAfter the climb up and descent from the second-category Puerto de Monrepós after just 34 kilometers, this stage was almost completely flat and saw a mass sprint finish. The finishing city of Zaragoza is a traditional one in the Vuelta, having hosted stage finishes on 47 occasions. The wind that the city is known for was thought to wreak some havoc on the sprinters.\nThis was a rather straightforward day of racing. There were a few breakaway attempts in the first hour, but none succeeded. The breakaway that did succeed involved a single rider, Milram's Matej Jurčo, who the Euskaltel team let free after 37 kilometers. His maximum advantage grew to 7' 20\" before Quick Step and Rabobank, working for Tom Boonen and Óscar Freire, respectively, pulled the bunch ahead to bring him back and ensure a mass sprint finish. Jurčo took both intermediate sprints, and was briefly joined in his effort by José Antonio López as the main field neared him, but the pack became one again with 8 kilometers to the line. The bunched sprint was won by Sébastien Hinault, and the GC was unchanged by the day's results.\nStage 11.\n10 September 2008 – Calahorra to Burgos, 178 km\nThis was branded as a transitional stage, undulating for the 78 kilometers before a gradual increase in elevation that became more steep at the 138 kilometer mark at the third-category Alto de Valmala. After a plateau there, the finish into Burgos was on a lengthy, but slight, downhill.\nThis, again, was a very normal day of racing. Three riders, Serafín Martínez, Jose Antonio López, and Andriy Hryvko escaped the bunch after 35 kilometers and precisely one hour in the saddle. Their maximum advantage was 7 minutes, but the main field didn't have much trouble reeling them in, which they did 7 kilometers from the line. The majority of the field was together for a bunched sprint finish, which was won by Óscar Freire. The GC was again unchanged by the day's results."

        "text": "These are the individual stages of the 2008 Vuelta a España, with Stage 12 on 11 September and Stage 21 on September 21.\nStages.\nStage 12.\n11 September 2008 – Burgos to Suances, 186 km\nGoing into the second rest day, the field faced a hilly stage, with two second and one third-category climb along the course and lots of descending. The final 40 kilometers, after the second-category Alto del Carracol, undulated very gently, so any type of finish was seen as possible.\nThe escaping breakaway formed after 10 kilometers, involving Sébastien Hinault, Sandy Casar, and Manuel Quinziato. As the breakaway formed, Tinkoff tried to place a rider in it, but was unsuccessful. The main field was paced alternately by Caisse d'Epargne, Quick Step, and Lampre, and their pace combined with the cold and rainy weather of the day proved a tough test for many riders, dropping back from the field. An unexpected rider to crack, toward the end of the stage, was Alejandro Valverde, who finished more than 3 minutes behind the stage winner and fell out of the top ten in the GC. The rest of his Caisse d'Epargne team went back with him to try to pace him back into the front group, but they were not successful. Ezequiel Mosquera also fell out of the front group briefly, but his Xacobeo–Galicia teammates were able to get him back in there.\nThe pace that Quick Step and Lampre set kept it so that the breakaway never attained more than 4 minutes of advantage. They were caught well before the line, with some 30 kilometers to race. A 28-man group was together with a sizeable advantage over the rest of the field in the stage's final minutes. The group had several members of the top teams in the GC, Astana and Euskaltel–Euskadi, who took the pace. Alberto Contador was the first of this group to attack for the stage win, but the victory went to Paolo Bettini, who had ironically given interviews earlier in the day describing his dissatisfaction over his team Quick Step signing Stefan Schumacher from the dissolving and vowed to ride for someone else in 2009. Contador took back three seconds on Egoi Martínez in the final sprint to the line.\nRest day.\n12 September 2008\nStage 13.\n13 September 2008 – San Vicente de la Barquera to Alto de L'Angliru, 209 km \nThere were five categorized climbs on this course, including three first-category hills, but the main attraction was the special-category Alto de El Angliru at the finish, which made its fourth appearance in the Vuelta and first since 2002. This brutal climb featured gradients as high as 23% near the summit.\nThe Euskaltel team kept several attempted breakaways in the first hour from going clear. This was not to protect the overall lead of Egoi Martínez, which was all but assured to be lost on such a stage (as Martínez was not seen as a strong enough climber in comparison with others high in the GC), but to protect the chances of victory in the Vuelta's queen stage for Igor Antón. Ironically, Antón would fail to even finish the stage, abandoning after sustaining a broken collarbone in a crash climbing Angliru.\nThe rider that succeeded at coming clear was Christophe Kern, allowed to leave after 37 kilometers and an hour in the saddle. Shortly afterward, a two-man chase was formed, comprising Maarten Tjallingii and Matej Jurčo. With so much more looming at the finish, the main field was more than content to let these three top the third-category Alto de Ortigueiro well ahead of them. After the descent, Kern pulled up and literally waited at the side of the road for about two minutes for the other two to join him, so they could all work together.\nThe Astana Team came forward to take the pace at the bottom of the first first-category climb of the day, the Puerto de Arnicio. The breakaway's lead at this point was 11 minutes, but it slowly and steadily fell until a 20-man group who were able to take Astana's pace caught them just after the summit of the third first-category hill, the Alto del Cordal. Domestiques from Astana and Caisse d'Epargne traded shots setting the pace up the Alto de El Angliru, going up to the finish line. As the climb neared its hardest part, 7 kilometers from the end, it was Levi Leipheimer who came forward to sacrifice himself for Alberto Contador, setting a pace that cracked everyone in the group (and caused Leipheimer himself to bonk), but left Contador free to attack for the stage win. The golden jersey came with it.\nStage 14.\n14 September 2008 – Oviedo to Fuentes de Invierno, 158 km \nThis stage went from hilly to mountainous. There were six categorized climbs on this course, three first-category and three third-category. The three third-category hills were all in the first 35 kilometers, leaving the riders to tackle three first-category climbs over the remainder of the stage, ending nearly as high in elevation as they did the previous day at Angliru when they headed up to the ski resort Fuentes de Invierno.\nAn eight-man group broke free of the main field after 25 kilometers, just before the third-category climb of San Tirso. A three-man chase joined them on the descent, and the eleven were away as a sustained group for much of the stage. Their maximum advantage grew to five minutes before the main field, paced mostly by Caisse d'Epargne rather than the race leader's Astana Team, started to reel them in. Their sporting director Eusebio Unzué explained that the breakaway had unexpectedly contained some high-profile riders and they needed to keep the time gap as low as possible to try to work for a stage win for Alejandro Valverde at Fuentes de Invierno.\nEzequiel Mosquera made attack after attack on the way up to the summit, and only Valverde and the Astana duo of race leader Alberto Contador and teammate Levi Leipheimer were able to answer. Eventually, Valverde also fell, and the stage was contested among the other three. Contador attacked within a kilometer of the finish and Mosquera couldn't answer, giving Contador a second straight stage win. This time, he had three leader's jerseys awaiting him on the podium – the golden, the white, and the points classification blue jersey.\nIt was later revealed that Contador and Valverde had struck a deal that they would stick together on the stage and Valverde would take the stage win while Contador retained the overall lead in the Vuelta. However, when Mosquera's attacks cracked Valverde, Contador took the opportunity for the stage win.\nStage 15.\n15 September 2008 – Cudillero to Ponferrada, 202 km \nThis stage had a first, a second, and a third-category climb on it, in succession. There was as well an uncategorized hill about 10 kilometers before the finish that was thought to keep any sprinters that survived that far honest.\nThe day's breakaway formed after a little over 50 kilometers, as several escape attempts consolidated into one 17-man breakaway. Their lead grew to a maximum of nearly 17 minutes, as the Astana-paced main field was more than content to let them go, seeing no threats in the group. José Luis Arrieta, Juan Manuel Gárate, and David Arroyo traded attacks on the way into Ponferrada, that cracked some of their breakaway mates who finished as much as seven minutes behind them, but it was Xacobeo–Galicia rider David García who won the stage, launching the decisive attack 3 kilometers from the line. The main field finished 14'23\" behind the stage winner, but there were no changes to the top ten in the GC.\nStage 16.\n16 September 2008 – Ponferrada to Zamora, 186 km\nAfter the first-category Alto del Acebo at the 15 kilometer mark, the riders escaped the mountains for the time being – there were no further categorized climbs in this stage or the next one. After the descent, the course didn't so much as undulate, so a bunched sprint finish was expected.\nThe field took it very easy for the first hour. There were no breakaway attempts, and that first hour in the saddle covered just the 15 kilometers to the Alto de Acebo. On the descent, the attacks began. Jesús Rosendo, who had earlier in the Vuelta been the first leader of the King of the Mountains, and Walter Fernando Pedraza were the ones that got away, and attained a maximum advantage of 8 minutes on the main field. The field was pulled along not by the race leader's team Astana, but by Quick Step, and in particular Paolo Bettini, working to get Tom Boonen a second stage victory in this Vuelta. The teams of other prominent sprinters came forward to take the pace over from Bettini when he later needed medical attention. The catch occurred 7 kilometers from the line, and Boonen indeed won his second bunched sprint, after an early leadout headed by Bettini.\nStage 17.\n17 September 2008 – Zamora to Valladolid, 148 km\nAn almost totally flat stage 17 was the reward for the sprinters who made it this far. There were no categorized climbs at all on this course. While there were not any hills, it was thought that crosswinds would present a bother to the sprinters in the field.\nPedro Horrillo and José Ruiz broke free of the main field after 13 kilometers. The main field kept them well within reach, and kept several other escape attempts from going clear. Horrillo and Ruiz attained a maximum advantage of over 8 minutes, but the bunch, behind the pace of Silence–Lotto and Euskaltel–Euskadi, caught them 7 kilometers from the line. Imanol Erviti tried to attack 3 kilometers from the finish, but the field caught him. The vast majority of the field finished together, and there was no significant change in the GC for the fourth day in a row.\nStage 18.\n18 September 2008– Valladolid to Las Rozas, 167 km\nBranded as flat, this stage gradually increased in elevation to its one categorized climb, the third-category Alto de los Leones at the 39 kilometers to go mark, and then gradually decreased to the finishing town of Las Rozas. Another mass sprint finish was expected, but it did not occur.\nAfter a blisteringly fast first hour that covered nearly 50 kilometers and kept several breakaway attempts from going free, an 18-man break formed at the 56 kilometer mark. The best-placed rider in the break was Nicolas Roche, 17th overall and 19'31\" behind race leader Alberto Contador. The second hour in the saddle saw the pace ease up, as Contador's Astana Team was content to let the breakaway go, since they did not figure to gain nineteen and a half minutes in such a course. The advantage grew to a maximum of 8'15\" before the riders in the breakaway began attacking each other and fragmenting. The field didn't take much advantage, as they finished 7'29\" behind the stage winner. Roche appeared to launch the decisive attack into Las Rozas and to be in line for the stage win, but it was Imanol Erviti, who had attacked too early and paid the price the previous day, who timed the finishing kick just right and overtook Roche in the final meters to win the stage. There was again no significant change in the GC after this stage.\nStage 19.\n19 September 2008– Las Rozas to Segovia, 145 km\nThis stage offered one last taste of the mountains for the 2008 Vuelta before the time trial and the traditional finish in Madrid. There was a short circuit, of which the riders took 2 laps, in the finishing town of Segovia, thought to leave the type of finish up in the air.\nThe day's breakaway formed slowly, over the course of almost ten kilometers after nearly an hour and a half in the saddle. It numbered fourteen riders, including four from Caisse d'Epargne, which boded well for Alejandro Valverde. The elite group of favorites, another thirteen strong, never let them get more than two minutes' advantage, and caught them with a third of the stage left to race. Numerous riders launched further attacks on the way into Segovia, with none coming more than ten seconds clear. Perhaps the most aggressive among them was Vasil Kiryienka, who was narrowly defeated in his spring to the line by David Arroyo. The group of GC favorites finished 11 seconds behind the stage winner, and only the bonus seconds won by Joaquim Rodríguez in intermediate sprints caused the GC to change in any way.\nStage 20.\n20 September 2008 – La Granja de San Ildefonso to Alto de Navacerrada, 17 km (ITT)\nThis time trial was short, but was thought to still live up to the billing the race against the clock gets as the \"race of truth\" – it ended at the first-category Alto de Navacerrada. The last 7 kilometers of the course were all uphill.\nThe early time to beat was set by Rubén Pérez, but, true to form, the GC contenders, strong climbers all of them, all solidly defeated Pérez's time. Carlos Sastre rode with strength and consistency, to hold off the charge of Ezequiel Mosquera and keep his podium position. Young Rabobank rider Robert Gesink slipped two spots in the GC at the end of the day, but was still in the top ten for the time trial, showing how fast, tightly bunched, and truly elite the group of riders ahead of him was. Levi Leipheimer had the best time at each intermediate time check and went on to win the stage by more than 30 seconds over his teammate and team leader Alberto Contador. Contador later took some offense to Leipheimer seemingly riding with winning the Vuelta in mind, after it had been established earlier that he (Contador) was Astana's team leader. Contador nonetheless rode a very strong time trial as well, enough to retain his golden jersey and put him on the cusp of being the youngest ever to win all three cycling Grand Tours in his career and just the third ever, and first in 27 years, to win the Vuelta and the Giro d'Italia in the same year.\nStage 21.\n21 September 2008 – San Sebastián de los Reyes to Madrid, 102 km\nThe sprinters got the final say in one last mad dash for the line in the traditional closing city.\nAs is tradition when the last day of a Grand Tour is a road stage, this was a straightforward day of racing with no attacking before reaching the closing city. Once on the Madrid circuit, many riders tried to break free of the pack, but none ultimately succeeded – the group was all one in the eighth and final lap. During that eighth lap, two huge crashes thinned the field considerably and limited who could challenge for the stage win. Among the riders to fall was Vuelta champion Alberto Contador. They took place inside 3 kilometers to the finish line, and since this was a flat stage, everyone who fell was given the same finishing time as the group they were in upon falling, which meant the entire field got the same finishing time. The stage was won by CSC's Matti Breschel."

        "text": "The 1946 Giro d'Italia was the 29th edition of the Giro d'Italia, organized and sponsored by the newspaper \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\". The race began on 15 June in Milan with a stage that stretched to Turin, finishing back in Milan on 7 July after a stage and a total distance covered of .\nThe race was won by Gino Bartali of the Legnano team, with fellow Italians Fausto Coppi and Vito Ortelli coming in second and third respectively.\nParticipants.\nThe 1946 Giro d'Italia was contested by seven teams and six groups. Each team consisted of seven riders, while each group was made up of four cyclists. This made the starting peloton total 79 riders. Nearly half of the riders were starting their first edition of the Giro. Of the riders that began the race, only 40 were able to complete the race. Joseph Magnani became the first American, and by the virtue North American, to compete in the Giro. The peloton was entirely Italian as Italy was technically still at war with most other countries.\nAfter having ridden together on Legnano at the last Giro and until World War II halted professional cycling in Italy, Fausto Coppi (Bianchi) and Gino Bartali (Legnano) entered the Giro now on different teams. Coppi started the season in great form and won the Milan–San Remo by over fourteen minutes after riding nearly the whole race alone. Tensions between the two riders elevated after May's Züri-Metzgete, where Bartali asked Coppi to help him to the finish and, if so, he would not contest the race to the line. Coppi agreed, but Bartali attacked as Coppi adjusted his toe straps and won the race, angering Coppi. Together, they were seen as favorites to win the race. Mario Ricci, Adolfo Leoni, Aldo Bini, and Glauco Servadei also received consideration as riders to win the opening stage. Vito Ortelli was another other main contenders for the race win. In interview with the Unione Velocipedistica Italiana president Borroni, Bartali stated that he only wanted to ride the Giro in order to get granted permission to ride the Tour de Suisse. Fermo Camellini and Oreste Conte received attention as threats to win the race. A notable exclusion was Fiorenzo Magni who was not allowed to participate due to a suspension by the UVI.\nThe squads entering the race were:\nTrade teams\nGroups\nRoute and stages.\nThe Italian Cycling Federation announced on 7 December 1945 that several of bike races would be return the following season including the likes of the Giro, Giro di Lombardia, Milan–San Remo, and more. The significance of the restart was noted by a \"l'Unità\" writer who wrote: \"... this Giro makes the idea of unity of our nation concrete...\" The paper even took to referring it as the \"Giro della Rinascita\" (). Cities in Italy submitted requests to be hosts for the stages of the Giro by 28 January 1946. As planning started, there were problems that arose: as the bombing from the war had destroyed bridges and roads significantly. The damages to the railroad system and the southern roads in particular, limited the Giro to the land north of Naples. A main concern of race organizers was the date of the Italian elections, which was announced to be on 2 June by the Council of Ministers. To avoid overlapping with the election, on 13 March the event was announced, and that it would start on 15 June and end on 7 July. The route was fully revealed on 11 April. The route was viewed to be largely symbolic in nature as it visited sites that were related to events from the First and Second World Wars like Trento, Bassano del Grappa, and Piave. Pope Pius XII wrote to \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" and mentioned he would offer an audience if the race were to pass through Rome, which the organizers obliged and the riders had the opportunity to meet the Pope.\nThe day before the race started, organizers announced the stage from Rovigo to the Allied controlled Trieste could not finish in Trieste and its finish would be moved to Vittorio Veneto. Trieste was then under British and American control as Italy and Yugoslavia disputed the land. This decision caused controversy both within Trieste and across Italy and the government soon began to negotiate for a finish in Trieste. After the race had started, on 22 June, the Allied Military Command announced that the originally planned finish in Trieste would be allowed.\nRace overview.\nThe twelfth leg of the race started at 6:25 am local time. British radio (A.I.S.) stated that a large trunk was placed on the road two kilometers after Pieris, on the border of Venezia Giulia. Stones were thrown at the riders and the local polic followed the race and dispersed the crowds. Shots were fired and the police responded, which led to people hiding in the bushes shooting upon the police and them retaliating until the crowd and the shooters dispersed. The cyclists met to determine if they would still ride, some rode to Udine, while others rode to Miramare reached the Montebello race course by bicycle. The race jury released a statement stated that an unexpected event happened where stones were thrown at riders, along with nails and other obstacles being placed in the road. The same time was awarded to all the riders. After a long pause in action, the riders continued to race to Trieste's finish, in the Montebello hippodrome for the stage victory. The start of the stage from Udine to Auronzo was moved to Tuesday. Trieste's Giro d'Italia committee announced that no riders had been seriously injured. Marangonni and Pasquini had abrasions and could continue racing.\nClassification leadership.\nThe leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider – wore a pink jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro. A similar classification to the general classification was the \"aggruppati\" classification which was calculated in the same fashion as the general classification, but it was excluse to the riders competing from groups rather than teams.\nIn the mountains classification, the race organizers selected different mountains that the route crossed and awarded points to the riders who crossed them first.\nThe winner of the team classification was determined by adding the finish times of the best three cyclists per team together and the team with the lowest total time was the winner. If a team had fewer than three riders finish, they were not eligible for the classification. The group classification was decided in the same manner, but the classification was exclusive to the competing groups.\nThere was a black jersey (maglia nera) awarded to the rider placed last in the general classification. The classification was calculated in the same manner as the general classification.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.\nAftermath.\nBartali after the victory, stated \"I had become \"Ginettaccio\", but 'Giant of the Mountain' was a nickname no one would yet take away.\""

As a rookie, he finished fourth on the team with 18 special teams tackles and was a part of the Super Bowl XXX championship team that won over the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nIn 1996, he tore the anterior cruciate ligament and the lateral collateral ligament in his left knee during a mini-camp and was placed on the Physically Unable to Perform list. After being activated on November 8, he was limited to seven games, while playing on special teams and as an outside linebacker in the nickel defense.\nIn 1997, he played as the slot corner in the nickel defense and established himself as one of the best special teams players in the NFL, by leading the team with 26 tackles and earning Pro Bowl consideration. Williams was also recognized as the best cover special teams player in the league, by Paul Zimmerman of Sports Illustrated.\nIn 1998, he was re-signed by the Cowboys to a two-year contract. He competed for the starting free safety position that was left open after Brock Marion left as a free agent, but it was eventually assigned to George Teague. He missed the season opener while recovering from a broken right thumb. During the year he made his first NFL career starts at cornerback (3), to replace the injured Kevin Smith and Deion Sanders, while finishing with 25 tackles, 7 passes defensed and 14 special teams tackles (fourth on the team).\nIn 1999, he had 8 starts at cornerback over Kevin Mathis, registering 64 tackles, 11 passes defensed, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery. In 2000, he played in 11 games, missing the first five while recovering from knee surgery. He was not re-signed after the season."

        "text": "The England cricket team toured South Africa under the auspices of the Marylebone Cricket Club from December 1905 to March 1906. There were five Test matches, and seven first-class games against South African provincial teams. While the team won a number of their first-class matches, they also lost several, and South Africa won the Test series 4 to 1.\nEngland squad.\nJack Mason of Kent was MCC's first choice as captain, but he was unable to take the time away from his law practice.\nWarm up matches.\nWestern Province against the MCC.\nBetween 1 December 1905 and 12 December, The MCC played two first-class matches against Western Province at Cape Town cricket ground. The MCC made 365, choosing to bat having won the toss. PF Warner (56) D Denton (78), FL Fane (60) and AE Relf (61*) all made half-centuries while Whitehead took the best figures of the home team's bowlers with 6/100. In response, the hosts were quickly removed for 96 with Schofield Haigh taking 5/29, the pick of the MCC's bowlers. Forced to follow on, Western Province were bowled out for 142, with a five-wicket haul for Crawford.\nAfter four days of rest, the MCC and Western Provinces came together once more at the same ground, and on this occasion the home team won the toss and chose to bat. They were unable to make a solid start, however, being bowled out for 81 with nine batsmen scoring only single figures, and with the innings extras (six) outscoring six of their batsmen. The MCC responded with 272 all out, with half centuries for Relf (60) and wicket keeper LJ Moon (57). Western Province then scored 233 with scores of 80 and 74 for SJ Snooke and SE Horwood, Crawford taking six wickets for the MCC. Despite this innings, the MCC required only 43 runs to win, and Warner together with fellow opener EG Wynyard made the runs without loss.\nTransvaal.\nOn Boxing Day, the MCC played a 3-day match against Transvaal at Johannesburg. Choosing to bat first, Transvaal were bowled out for 135 with Walter Lees taking five wickets. In response, MCC gained a lead of 130 with their innings of 265 supported largely by a 132* from Denton. Transvaal scored 305 in response, with half-centuries for WA Shalders (66) and GA Faulkner (63). MCC needed 176 to win, but three wickets for Faulkner and a five-wicket haul for Schwarz meant that MCC made only 115, giving Transvaal victory by 60 runs.\nFirst-class matches.\nArmy v MCC.\nThe South African Army faced the MCC for a three-day match on an army camp in Pretoria between the first and second Test matches on 12 January. Batting first, the MCC declared on 480 built from a 130 from Denton, and half-centuries from LJ Moon (80), Sir Henry Leveson-Gower (67*) and Crawford (54). In response, the Army were bowled out for 97, with P Mitford making 65 of their total. Following on, the Army reached 165 thanks to a 68 from FA Macfarlan, and a 32 from JA Davenport, however they were still 218 runs short, giving the MCC victory by an innings and 218 runs.\nNatal v MCC.\nThe MCC then played a three-day match against Natal in Durban. Losing the toss, the MCC were forced to bowl as Natal reached 191, largely due to a century from Nourse (119). The MCC then stumbled 17 short of Natal's target when they were bowled out for 175, Denton top scoring with 53 and Nourse taking five wickets to go with his century. Natal then made 159 to take their lead to 176, with Blythe taking five wickets for the MCC. Chasing the target, the MCC lost early wickets to leave them 38/4, however an unbeaten 77 from Fane and some lower-order runs from Haigh took them to victory by four wickets, despite Nourse taking four more wickets to leave him with a tally of nine for the match to go with his 119 from the first innings.\nTwo days later, Natal met the MCC in Pietermaritzburg for a second three-day match. Winning the toss, the MCC inserted Natal and bowled them out for 117 on the first day, however they were only able to take a slender lead when they were in turn bowled out for 191 despite a 59 from Fane, with Hime taking five wickets. Natal were then limited to 173 by a seven-wicket-haul from Haigh, allowing the MCC to chase down their target of 100 runs with four wickets remaining.\nEastern Province v MCC.\nThe final match of the tour for the MCC saw them meet the Eastern Province cricket team at Port Elizabeth on 20 February. The hosts batted first, however the MCC bowled them out for 132 with Hartley taking 6/32. The MCC then reached 201 despite being at one time 30/3 with both Denton and Fane out for ducks, as Crawford (64) and Wynyard (54) made good preparation for the remaining Test matches with half-centuries. The hosts were then run through by Blythe (5/30) and (4/34) and left 92 all out, leaving the MCC with 24 runs to win, which they reached for no loss.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nEngland and South Africa faced each other for the first Test at Johannesburg on 2 January 1906. A four-day match, it was the first in a five-Test series, and Test match debut for six South African and four English players. The toss, like the match, was overseen by umpires J Phillips and FE Smith from Australia and England respectively, and was won by England, who chose to bat.\nThe first innings began poorly, with England struggling to 15/3 before a 29 from Wynward, a 20 from EG Hayes on debut and a 44 from JN Crawford, also on debut, saw them to 147/8. Late blows by debutant Lees and C Blythe took them to 184 all out. The South African innings, however, began with similar setbacks, as they reached 44/7. The first six of the match from AEE Vogler, a South African Test debutant, helped see them to 91; however this was still 94 runs behind England's total.\nThus England began her second innings with a lead of 94, which was increased to 149 for the loss of two wickets thanks in part to a half-century from Warner (51). Only Crawford showed any resistance out of the rest of the batting lineup, however, with 42, and England were all out for 190 setting South Africa a target of 284 runs to win the match. While this was higher than any score reached thus far in the match, South Africa made the target with one wicket to spare thanks to a four-hour knock of 81 by GC White in his second Test match innings, and a score of 93* from AW Nourse. South Africa, therefore, took the lead 1.0 in the five-match series.\n2nd Test.\nSouth Africa led the series 1:0 by the time of the second Test at Johannesbury on 6 March. Officiated by the same umpires, England won the toss and chose to bat, handing a debut to LJ Moon. Three wickets each to Sinclair and Faulkner, however, held England at 148 all out and South Africa were batting by the end of the first day, and by the second day they were 277 all out thanks to a half-century from South African Sincliar (66) and 4/64 from England's Haigh.\nEngland began their second innings poorly, with the top three batsmen dismissed for single figures they reached 19/3, which soon became 25/4 when Moon was out for a duck. A 65 from Fane combined with a 30 and 37 from Wynyard and Relf respectively helped England limp to 160 all out, leaving South Africa a target of only 32 runs. While Lees removed South African opener WA Shalders for a duck, South Africa had no further difficulty taking a nine-wicket victory.\n3rd Test.\nThe third Test at Johannesburg began on 10 March, and England handed a Test debut to JC Hartley as they lost the toss and were given the ball as South Africa chose to bat first. The hosts reaped the rewards of first use of the pitch, amassing 338 runs in the first day, and reaching 385 all out on the second day thanks to a century from CMH Hathorn (102) and a half-century from Nourse (61), despite the best efforts of Lees 6/78 and Blythe 2/72.\nIn reply, England managed 295 thanks largely to 143 from Fane, no other batsman passing 36, with the South Africa bowlers Snooke (4/57) and Schwarz (4/67) taking the majority of the wickets. Another century followed in South Africa's second innings from White (147) supported by a knock of 73 from opener and captain LJ Tancred and a 55 from Nourse combining to give them a second inning score of 349. Left with a large target of 440 to win, England staggered to 75/5 before Denton's 61 and Crawford's 34 helped England limp to 171/7. Sooke, who finished with figures of 8/70, removed the remaining batsmen to leave England all out for 196 and give South Africa a 243 run victory to take an unassailable 3:0 lead in the series.\n4th Test.\nEngland entered the fourth Test at Cape Town with no chance victory with the series 3:0 with two to play. Losing the toss, England were given the ball and a six-wicket haul for Blythe helped restrict South Africa to 218. England were not, however, able to take a lead with their innings of 198 falling 20 runs short, with Sinclair and Faulkner taking four wickets each.\nSouth Africa began their second innings with a 20 run lead, however Blythe and Crawford reduced them to 28/2, and despite a 73 from White South Africa were bowled out for 138 thanks to a five-wicket haul from Blythe, and four wickets for Lees. Seven South African batsmen were dismissed for single figure scores, and England needed only 159 runs to win. Despite losing both openers for four runs and reeling at 34/3, a partnership between Moon (28) and Fane (66*) helped England to victory by four wickets. This took the series to 3:1.\n5th Test.\nThe fifth and final Test took place in Cape Town on 30 March. With the series at 3:1 to South Africa, England could not affect the result, however they began well by winning the toss and choosing to bat. A 4/45 from Sinclair, however, restricted England to 187 all out, with Crawford's 74 the only half-century. South Africa surpassed England with a score of 333 all out, thanks to Snooke (60) and a rapid 62 in 75 minutes from AEE Vogler, the last-wicket partnership being worth 94.\nEngland were bowled out in their second innings for 130, 16 runs short of South Africa's score. Moon and Relf, with scores of 33 and 21 respectively, were the only batsmen to pass 20, five were out for single figures and the extras outscored nine of England's batsmen. Four wickets for Nourse and three for Schwarz helped seal South Africa's victory by an innings and 16 runs, taking the Test series 4:1."

        "text": "The men's 100 metre freestyle was a swimming event held as part of the swimming at the 1928 Summer Olympics programme. It was the seventh appearance of the event, which had not been featured only at the 1900 Games. The competition was held on Friday and Saturday, 10 and 11 August 1928. Thirty swimmers from 17 nations competed. Nations had been limited to three swimmers each since the 1924 Games. Johnny Weissmuller of the United States repeated as gold medalist in the event, the second man to do so (after Duke Kahanamoku, who Weissmuller had beaten in 1924 for his first gold). It was the fifth consecutive victory for an American swimmer in the men's 100 metre freestyle. István Bárány earned Hungary's first medal in the event since 1908 with his silver. Katsuo Takaishi's bronze was Japan's first men's 100 metre freestyle medal. Bárány and Takaishi prevented the Americans from sweeping the medals a third consecutive time (1920 and 1924), as the United States swimmers finished first, fourth, and fifth.\nBackground.\nThis was the seventh appearance of the men's 100 metre freestyle. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.\nTwo of the five finalists from 1924 returned: gold medalist Johnny Weissmuller of the United States and fifth-place finisher Katsuo Takaishi of Japan. Weissmuller, as in 1924, was a heavy favorite in the event. He held the world record and had not been beaten in seven years.\nChile, Panama, and Poland each made their debut in the event. The United States made its seventh appearance, having competed at each edition of the event to date.\nCompetition format.\nThis freestyle swimming competition used a three-round (quarterfinals, semifinals, final) format. The advancement rule was the one used since 1912; for each round before the final, the top two in each heat plus the fastest third-place swimmer would advance. There were 7 heats of between 3 and 5 swimmers, allowing 15 swimmers to advance to the semifinals. The 3 semifinals had 5 swimmers each; 7 advanced to the final.\nEach race involved two lengths of the 50-metre pool.\nRecords.\nThese were the standing world and Olympic records (in seconds) prior to the 1928 Summer Olympics.\nJohnny Weissmuller improved his own Olympic record in the semifinals with 58.6 seconds and equalized this time again in the final.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe fastest two in each heat and the fastest third-placed from across the heats advanced.\nSemifinals.\nThe fastest two in each semi-final and the fastest third-placed from across the semi-finals advanced.\nFinal.\nSaturday 11 August 1928:"

It was also the first overseas tour undertaken by any of the home countries as a single entity. Seventeen players were selected to make the journey to Canada but no caps were awarded. Three clubs – Dublin University, Lansdowne and North of Ireland FC – provided fifteen of these players. Many of those who went on the tour had not played, nor did they subsequently play, for Ireland. Many of those who were part of the 1899 Triple Crown side were not able to afford the time or cost of the trip. Ireland often had to field just fourteen players due to injuries. Among those to be injured was James Myles who broke his leg. Myles, who was later elected as an independent TD of East Donegal, had to remain in Canada until December. The rest of the touring party had returned home in November. Ireland won 10 of the 11 matches they played. Their only defeat came against a Halifax XV in the third game of the tour. They scored 150 points and conceded 51. The trip was financed by Duke Collins, an Irish Canadian who originally came from County Dublin but had settled in Toronto.\nMatches.\n\"Scores and results list Ireland's points tally first.\""

        "text": "Commercial Swimming Club is a swimming club that is based at the Fortitude Valley Pool in centre of Brisbane, Queensland. Club members have represented the country at the Olympic Games, FINA World Aquatics Championships and Commonwealth Games. Prominent club members have included Susie O'Neill, Cate and Bronte Campbell, Kieren Perkins and Libby Trickett.\nHistory.\nThe Commercial Swimming Club is over 110 years old, commencing as a ladies' club, The Ladies Commercial Amateur Swimming Club, about November, 1903. A men's club, The Commercial Amateur Swimming Club, commenced in 1913. The two clubs amalgamated in 1974.\nAll of the original records and other photographs and documentation relating to the club's first 104 years in the possession of the Club, were handed to the John Oxley Library, part of the Queensland State Library, in Brisbane by Barry Short, in 2007, to prevent the loss of any of these records as did happen to much of the early records. Additional records relating to each season of the club are being forwarded to the John Oxley Library to continue the recording of the club's history, for the benefit of those writing a history of the club's second 100 years.\nThe beginning of the club in 1903 and after, shows a very different story to the modern swimming scene. The women' club conducted a three-mile race in the Bremer River, on 22 March 1913, won by Minnie King. About the same time, three mile races were regularly being held in the river for men. According to Jim Dunning, the men's club's original Secretary: \"On the Saturday before the three mile swim, the Queensland Ladies' Amateur Swimming Association allowed men to be spectators at a ladies carnival for the first time in many years. It was the occasion of the interstate ladies Championship.\" Another women's three mile race was conducted by Commercial Ladies' in the following season in 1913.\nThe men's club's first world record holder, James William Thompson, won it swimming one mile backstroke. He is recorded of being a world record holder early in the men's club's life (from 1913) and a copy of a certificate shows he swam a further mile world record on 18 January 1918, swimming the distance in backstroke in 29 minutes and 4.2 seconds, at the City Bath on Wickham St in Fortitude Valley. At that time the baths, also known as the Booroodabin Baths, were covered and were 100 feet long."

        "text": "Walter John Martin DCM (born 14 May 1883 in Woodford, England) was a Wales international rugby union player. He played club rugby predominantly for Newport, captaining the side and played county rugby for Monmouthshire. While playing for Newport, Martin faced the three major Southern Hemisphere teams, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. At international level he represented Wales on three occasions.\nClub career.\nMartin joined Newport Rugby Club in 1904, and during his career would captain the club during one of the most successful era's for the club. At Newport he formed an incredibly successful partnership with Tommy Vile, and they would face the touring New Zealanders, South Africans and Australians together.\nInternational career.\nMartin made his debut for Wales against Ireland at the Balmoral Showgrounds on 9 March 1912 as part of the Five Nations Championship. In an inexperienced team, Martin was one of seven new caps, under the captaincy of Jack Bancroft, and although leading at half time the team lost 12-5. Despite the loss, Martin was back for the next match, and this time finished on the winning side. Martin did not play for Wales the next season, but was back after the First World War, in a game against the New Zealand Army, which is now recognised as an international game. Martin was not the first choice in the New Zealand game, as the selectors had chosen Cardiff's Clem Lewis, but Lewis had picked up an injury playing for the British Army team. Martin was drafted in as a late replacement but during the game injured his head saving a try. Martin was removed from play, but later recovered and resumed the game, although his play was not as strong after the event. Martin's three caps were all played in partnership with Newport team mate, Tommy Vile.\nInternational games played.\nWales\nMilitary service and later life.\nIn World War I Martin served in the South Wales Borderers and was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions during the war. On his return he rejoined Newport and worked for Great Western Railway at Newport Docks, but in 1933 he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Martin, who had suffered from depression, hanged himself while receiving treatment as a long term patient at St Woolos Hospital on 30 April 1933."

        "text": "The 2010 IIHF World Championship was the 74th IIHF World Championship, an annual international ice hockey tournament. It took place between 7 and 23 May 2010 in Germany. The games were played in the Lanxess Arena in Cologne, SAP Arena in Mannheim, and one game at Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen. The Russian team was the defending champion, having won the previous two championships.\nThe Czech Republic, after an early 2–3 upset loss to Norway in the preliminary round, ultimately claimed their sixth world championship title by defeating defending champions, two years running, Russia, 2–1 in the final. Sweden won against Germany 3–1 for the bronze medal.\nCanada, which three months earlier, had won the 2010 Winter Olympics Men's Ice Hockey Gold on home-ice in Vancouver, after beating the Russians 7–3 in the Quarterfinals, had a disappointing tournament. They clinched the last spot in the playoff round and lost their quarterfinal 2–5 in a rematch versus Russia. They finished 7th overall, their second-worst finish in tournament history, after their 1992 8th-place finish.\nThe tournament stands as the most watched IIHF championship in history, with an estimated cumulative audience of over over the course of the tournament and viewers in over 100 countries and dependencies worldwide. It also was a considerable success regarding attendance for the tournament; it ranked as the second most attended ice hockey world championship of all time, narrowly behind the 2004 edition. In total 548,788 people attended, compared with 552,097 in 2004 in the Czech Republic. It since slipped to the fourth place, behind 2014 and 2015 editions.\nThe host nation of Germany had their best finish at the tournament since it switched to the current 16 nation format, and a player representing Germany (goaltender Dennis Endras) was named MVP for the first time in the history of the championship.\nSummary.\nPreliminary round.\nGroup A saw the higher seeded team win each match, with the exception of the game between Belarus and Slovakia which was won by Slovakia. Russia topped the group with the full nine points, Slovakia qualified in second and Belarus in third. Kazakhstan was sent to the relegation round, after being promoted to the finals tournament for the first time since 2006.\nIn Group B the higher seeded team won each match, with the exception of the final group match which saw Switzerland defeat the second-seeded Canadians for the first time in the history of the tournament. This upset led to Switzerland winning the group with nine points, followed by Canada in second and Latvia in third. Italy, back at the finals tournament after missing 2009, lost all its matches and was returned to the relegation round.\nGroup C action ended with three teams having a record of two wins and one defeat. Norway's upset defeat of Czech Republic caused a controversy when Jaromír Jágr, a famous member of the Czech team, spoke out against other Czech stars turning down the tournament. This later triggered an international hockey dispute, when a column was posted on IIHF.com regarding these comments and about players' turning down invitations to attend. This article was later taken down and René Fasel, president of the IIHF, noted his concern. Sweden, the Czech Republic and Norway all moved on to the qualification round, while France was sent to the relegation after failing to win any matches.\nIn Group D the opening game saw the first major upset. Germany in front of a record crowd of over 77,000 persons defeated the United States in overtime, 2–1. This group proved to be full of upsets; in the next match Denmark beat the fourth-seeded Finns, followed by the Danes defeating the Americans. Finland came up with two wins to top the group and move on to the qualification round, along with Germany in second place and Denmark in third. The final match between the U.S. and Finland determined the United States' last-place finish, and they were sent to the relegation round for the first time since 2003.\nQualification round.\nGroup E action first saw Denmark handing favored Slovakia a blowout upset, 6–0. In the next match Finland defeated Belarus, 2–0, after outshooting them 32 to 18. Russia narrowly defeated Germany 3–2, in which Alexander Ovechkin scored the winner. Russia continued with two more wins over Denmark and Finland to propel them to the group win, making them the only team to go undefeated into the playoff round. Belarus defeated Germany in overtime, and then defeated Denmark 2–1, but this was not enough to qualify and they ended in fifth place. In yet another upset, the host Germans defeated Slovakia 2–1 to win a qualifying spot in third place, much to the delight of the German fans and coach Uwe Krupp. Finland finished in second-place after Russia, followed by Germany and Denmark. Denmark managed to qualify for the quarter-finals for the first time in the history of the tournament. Slovakia finished a disappointing last, marking the third straight year in which they did not qualify for the quarter-finals in the lead up to their hosting of the 2011 IIHF World Championship.\nGroup F opened with Canada flexing its offense against Norway in a 12–1 blowout. Sweden then defeated Latvia 4–2, followed by Switzerland continuing its winning streak with an upset 3–2 win against the Czechs. Latvia defeated Norway but later lost to the Czech Republic, which resulted in their last placement in the group and their failure to qualify. Sweden beat Canada after an impressive performance by Swedish goaltender Jonas Gustavsson. In another upset, Norway managed to beat the in-form Swiss 3–2, but they would end in fifth place. The Czech Republic won against Canada 3–2 to lead them to finish ahead of the Canadians in the group. Sweden capped off the round with a convincing 5–0 win over Switzerland to finish as group winners. Switzerland finished in second after Sweden, followed by the Czech Republic. Canada, somewhat surprisingly as the second seed, grabbed the last qualifying spot in fourth place.\nRelegation round.\nIn the relegation round (Group G) the teams from the U.S., France, the newly promoted Italy and Kazakhstan faced each other after they had ended their respective preliminary groups in fourth and last place. The U.S. beat Kazakhstan in the first game 10–0, while France won against Italy in the decisive match for second place. There were no surprises on the second game-day, with the U.S. defeating France and Italy winning against Kazakhstan. The U.S. then defeated Italy in a shootout and France beat Kazakhstan 5–3. The final relegation results saw Kazakhstan and Italy go directly back down to Division I. Group-winners U.S. and second-placed France both qualified for the 2011 World Championships.\nPlayoff round.\nThe playoff round saw the top eight teams competing for the title of 2010 world champions. The quarter-finals began with a close match between Finland and the Czech Republic. After Petri Kontiola's early goal in the first minute, the game remained scoreless all the way into the third period. Jakub Klepiš scored the equalizer shortly after the final period started. No further goals were scored, so the game went into a scoreless overtime followed by a shootout. Jan Marek scored the decisive goal to put the Czechs into the semifinals.\nIn the second quarter-final, Sweden faced Denmark. This was Denmark's first appearance in the playoff round. After Sweden established a comfortable 3–0 lead, the Danes scored a goal in the second period. Seven minutes before the end Linus Omark scored a goal which restored the three-goal lead for Sweden. A late power play goal by Dane Morten Madsen was to no avail and Sweden won 4–2.\nThe third quarter-final featured a storied and contentious rivalry. Russia played against Canada in a repeat of the quarter-finals at the 2010 Olympics, in which Canada embarrassed the Russians 7–3. The opening period was a dead heat until a late goal by Maxim Afinogenov. Russia, still undefeated at the tournament, immediately overtook Canada in the second period, and led at one point in the third period by 4–0. Ilya Kovalchuk had a three-assist game and was a big boost for the Russians who won 5–2, following two late Canadian goals.\nThe final quarter-final was an evening game between the host Germany and their traditional rival, Switzerland. The first period was scoreless but not without chances, as the Swiss hit the post twice. Midway through the second period Philip Gogulla scored on the power play to give Germany the lead, and this goal would turn out to be the game winner. The Swiss outshot the Germans 41 to 27, and Dennis Endras is credited with keeping Germany in the game by preserving the one-goal lead. The win put Germany in the semifinals for the first time since 1953 and the match was dubbed by the IIHF as \"The Miracle at Mannheim\". At the end of the match there was a brawl between the teams, which included German assistant coach Ernst Höfner getting into an altercation with Swiss defenceman Timo Helbling. Both were handed match suspensions.\nAfter one day off the semifinals started with Sweden versus the Czech Republic. The first period was equal with both teams scoring one goal. Andreas Engqvist scored midway through the second period to put Sweden up 2–1. This lead held into very late in the third period. With 1:13 left in the third period the Czechs pulled their goalie to get a six on five opportunity and Karel Rachůnek scored the 2–2 equalizer with just 7.5 seconds left, putting the game into overtime. The overtime period stayed scoreless and it came down to the shootout. In a repeat of the quarter-final the Czechs won by a goal from Jan Marek.\nThe other semifinal between Germany and Russia was a close match, much like their qualification round game. The Germans started off the scoring with a goal from Marcel Goc during a two-man power play. At the midway point of the match Evgeni Malkin scored to tie up the game for the Russians. The remainder of the game was very close, and the tie was only broken with 1:50 minutes left, when Pavel Datsyuk scored the game-winning goal. The Germans pressed in the final minutes but the score held for a 2–1 Russian victory, putting them in the final for the third straight year.\nThe bronze medal game was between Sweden and the surprise semifinalists, hosts Germany. Magnus Pääjärvi-Svensson scored an early goal to put up Sweden 1–0. The game then went scoreless until late in the second period when on a 4–3 rush Alexander Barta managed to retrieve his own rebound and put it top-shelf past Jonas Gustavsson, tying up the game for Germany. Early in the third period Jonas Andersson fired a shot from a very tight angle which managed to beat Dennis Endras on the five hole. The score held until Andersson netted an empty-net goal to ensure Sweden's 3–1 victory, giving them their second straight bronze medal at the worlds.\nFinal.\nThe final was played between Russia and the Czech Republic for the first time in the history of the tournament, although the predecessors of both these nations, the USSR and Czechoslovakia, had met several times in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. It was Russia's third consecutive finals appearance, and the Czech Republic's first appearance since 2006.\nThe match began with a goal after just 20 seconds, scored by Jakub Klepiš from a pass by Jaromír Jágr. The goal was seemingly the result of a defensive mistake which led to a Czech offensive possession with Russian defensemen out of position. For the remainder of the period the Russians held almost complete possession of the puck, and veteran Sergei Fedorov hit the post after an odd man rush. Very late in the period the Russians put the puck in the net on a power play, but it was determined to be after the clock had run out and was ruled as no goal. There was some brief confusion however, as the buzzer sounds after the clock on the scoreboard runs out.\nIn the second period Russia pressed once again but the Czech Republic slowed the game down and forced Russia to regroup, resulting in an error in the Russian defensive zone when Alexander Ovechkin collided with teammate Fedorov. This led to a 3-on-2 rush for the Czechs and Karel Rachůnek centered the puck while Tomáš Rolinek crashed the net. The puck was redirected off Rolinek's skates, and it was ruled a good goal because there was no kicking motion visible.\nThe third period began with more Russian pressure, including a close chance off the post by Evgeni Malkin, but at the midway point of the period Russian Alexei Emelin was given a five-minute major and thrown out of the game for clipping Jaromír Jágr, who did not return for the remainder of the game. This was followed by more penalty trouble for both teams. In the final minutes after pulling goaltender Semyon Varlamov, Pavel Datsyuk buried a goal on a 5-on-3 with 35 seconds left, bringing Russia within one goal of the Czechs. Under pressure the Czech goalie Tomáš Vokoun managed to stave off the final Russian assault and the Czechs held on to win the game 2–1.\nThe president of the Czech Republic Václav Klaus handed out the gold medals alongside IIHF president René Fasel.\nRosters.\nEach team's roster for the 2010 IIHF World Championship consisted of at least 15 skaters (forwards, and defencemen) and two goaltenders, and at most 20 skaters and three goaltenders. All sixteen participating nations, through the confirmation of their respective national associations, had to submit a roster by the first IIHF directorate meeting on 6 May 2010.\nHost selection.\nFour nations, all located in Europe placed formal bids to host the 2010 IIHF World Championship. Those nations were:\nSlovakia and Sweden withdrew from bidding before voting began in order to apply for the 2011 World Championship. All four nations to bid on the 2010 World Championship later received winning bids. Slovakia won the bid to host the 2011 IIHF World Championship, Sweden won its bid to host in 2012, but this decision was later switched to be the joint host of the 2012, and 2013 IIHF World Championship editions (both with Finland), and Belarus to host the 2014 IIHF World Championship.\nAfter one round of voting, the winning bid was announced by IIHF president René Fasel on 15 May 2005, from Zürich, Switzerland. Belarus' bidding cities Minsk and Zhodzina received 18 votes to Germany's 89, thus finalizing Germany's successful bid.\nPromotions.\nOfficial song.\nThe official song of the tournament is \"Stuck on Replay\" by the German electronic dance band Scooter. It is the fourth single from their album \"Under the Radar Over the Top\". It was released on 12 March 2010, on the day of the Hamburg concert, the biggest show of their Under the Radar Over the Top tour.\nMascot.\nUrmel on Ice () is the official mascot of the tournament. A character created by Max Kruse and known by the German public from the Augsburger Puppenkiste and the Impy's Island (Urmel aus dem Eis ()) film was previously the mascot of the Deutsche Eishockey-Bund and the German national team. He wears number 10 on his jersey.\nMotto.\nThe official motto of the tournament was unveiled on 2 September 2009, in Lanxess Arena and is \"Germany on Ice\" ().\nAmbassadors.\nThe \"World Championship Ambassadors\" for 2010 included; Canadian legend Wayne Gretzky, Soviet ice hockey goaltender and ten time World champion Vladislav Tretiak, and \"Germany's ice hockey player of the century\" Erich Kühnhackl. They are all members of the IIHF Hall of Fame, and have all played in the IIHF World Championship previously. They were special members, alongside; Zdeno Chára, Peter Forsberg, Sergei Kostitsyn, Jari Kurri, Kim Martin, Mark Streit, Hayley Wickenheiser and Henrik Zetterberg, of a campaign called \"The Green Puck campaign\", which was an anti-doping initiative in association with the World Anti-Doping Agency.\nVenues.\nAttendance world record.\nThe opening game of the 74th IIHF World Championship took place at Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen on 7 May between Germany and the United States. On this occasion, the stadium's planned configuration would allow for a capacity of 76,152. This figure is higher than the past ice hockey attendance World Record held by Michigan State University, which was 74,554.\nIt was announced at the second intermission by \"Guinness World Records\" spokesman Christian Teufe, that not only had the Gelsenkirchen game passed the world record, but had exceeded it by over 3,000 individuals. The official attendance according to the IIHF, and confirmed by the Guinness World records, was 77,803. Both Eric Nystrom and David Moss, who were playing for the United States, had also played in the Michigan State game in 2001, making them the only people to have played both world record games.\nThe noise inside the stadium was considerably loud, due to the German ice hockey chants, whistles and drums, which according to Ryan Carter of Team USA left the Americans frustrated at the inability to communicate. Carter also said that the \"crowd was definitely the seventh man in this game for Germany\". Also notable about the game was that it was the first time in over 17 years of international hockey competition that Germany had defeated the United States, with Felix Schütz scoring the game winner in overtime, on Scott Clemmensen, for a 2–1 final score. The previous win was on 25 April 1993, also in Germany in Dortmund, during the 1993 World Championship when Germany beat the United States 6–3.\nThe President of Germany, Horst Köhler, along with other politicians were present for the match.\nThe overall attendance record was broken in December 2010 by The Big Chill at the Big House, though the crowd still remains the largest ever for an indoor hockey game.\nNations.\nThe following 16 nations qualified for the elite-pool tournament. One nation from Asia, 13 nations from Europe, and two nations from North America were represented.\nSeeding and grouping.\nThe seeding in the preliminary round was based on the 2009 IIHF World Ranking, which ends at the conclusion of the 2009 IIHF World Championship. The 2010 Olympics were therefore not included. The teams were grouped by seeding (in parentheses is the corresponding world ranking):\nGroup A\nGroup B\nGroup C\nGroup D\nPreliminary round.\nSixteen participating teams were placed in the following four groups. After playing a round-robin, the top three teams in each group advanced to the qualifying round. The last team in each group competes in the relegation round.\nGroups A and D were played in Cologne, with one game in Gelsenkirchen, and groups B and C were played in Mannheim.\nQualification round.\nThe top three teams from each group of the preliminary round advanced to the qualifying round. They were placed into two groups: teams from Groups A and D were placed into Group E, while teams from Groups B and C were placed into Group F.\nEvery team kept the points from preliminary round matches against teams who also advanced. The teams played a single round robin, but did not play against teams which they had already met in preliminary groups.\nThe top four teams in both groups E and F advanced to the playoff round.\nRelegation round.\nThe bottom team in the standings from each group of the preliminary round played in the relegation round. The bottom two teams in the relegation round moved down to Division 1 for the 2011 World Championship.\nPlayoff round.\nQuarter-finals.\nQuarterfinals in Cologne were scheduled to be the pairs 1E–4F and 2E–3F, and in Mannheim the pairs 1F–4E and 2F–3E.\nSemi-finals.\nPairs were the winner of 1E–4F vs. the winner of 2F–3E and 1F–4E vs. 2E–3F.\nRanking and statistics.\nFinal standings.\nThe final standings of the tournament according to IIHF:\nScoring leaders.\nList shows the top skaters sorted by points, then goals. If the list exceeds 10 skaters because of a tie in points, all of the tied skaters are shown.\nLeading goaltenders.\nOnly the top five goaltenders, based on save percentage, who have played 40% of their team's minutes are included in this list.\nOfficials.\nThe IIHF selected 16 referees and 16 linesmen to work the 2010 IIHF World Championship.

        "title": "Cricket in Colombia",
        "text": "Cricket has been played in Colombia since the beginning of the 20th century. There are reports of cricket matches played at La Magdalena Jockey Club in 1905, 1907 and 1909.\nCricket in Colombia received a boost on 20 May 1955 with the creation of the Bogotá Cricket Club (BCC). The first chairman of the club was Englishman Reginald Brand alongside his Indian \nRishiraj Patel.\nThe club's first match was played in Cali in December 1957 against a rival team gathered by a former BCC member representing Cali Shell. These matches were the first of a series of tests played between Bogotá against Cali and/or the Rest of Colombia for the \"H.E.'s Bat\", a prize donated by British Ambassador and Honorary President of the Club Sir James Joint. The top scorer of the Cali Shell team was none other than Zian Shah. \nThe first international match was played against Maracaibo (Shell) in Bogotá in February 1958. The return game was played in June of the same year. These series continued successfully until 1961.\nIn 1961 the Bogota Cricket Club was merged into the Bogotá Sports Club.\nIn March 1970, the New Zealand Ambassador's Cricket team visited the B.S.C. and was nearly beaten. That team included future internationals J.F.M. Morrison and A. Roberts.\nOther matches were played against Cali, Medellín, Caracas (team included ex-West Indies Test cricketer Tony White), Curaçao, Lima, the Banks, BEA Silver Wing Club, the California Cricket Club (on their South American Tour), the Quidnuncs (including Dudley Owen-Thomas, David Hays and Derek George), and finally in February 1979 Derrick Robins' XI.\nThe B.S.C. (with Tony White) was the only side to bowl them out (for 184) during their South American tour. Norman Bracht took 5–74 in 20 overs and White 3–70 in 22. Krish Vaidya, was the only player to remain not out with a century. Their side was managed by Peter Parfitt (with Henry Blofeld), captained by Chris Cowdrey and included Bill Athey, Graham Stevenson, Tim Lloyd, Spandan Pandya and other good young county cricketers. \nThough Cali and Bogotá played each other in 1981, in the eighties there were limited cricket appearances in Colombia and internationally due to the decline in the number of expat workers — and thus cricketers — in Colombia.\nHowever, the new millennium brought with it a mini-resurgence in Colombian cricket. The enthusiasm of Colombo-Canadian Norman Bracht, among others, allowed a game to be played in December 2000 between teachers of the Anglo Colombian school in Bogotá and a Bogotá Sports Club team comprising teachers from other schools, companies and the British Embassy. 26 players turned out at the first match, which took place at the Bogotá Sports Club's new venue on the via Cota-Suba in the north of Bogotá.\nMatches between teachers and other expats in Bogotá continued in 2001, before in May that year a touring team from Panamá spent a week in the Colombian capital. Panamá, led by Ismael Patel, won the two match series 2-0. Colombian Citizen Seraa Sharma, remembers the match to this day. \n2002 brought further strides for the sport in Colombia as Bogotá took a team to Cali for the first Ambassador's Cup in 21 years. Matches on the tour, which counted on the support of the British Ambassador at the time, Mr Tom Duggan, were held at the Colegio Colombo-Británico in Cali. Around 200 people watched the first game, on Saturday 22 March, which Bogotá won by 25 runs having scored 98 in their allotted 22 overs. In the second match, on Sunday 3 March, Bogotá scored 176, enough to give them victory by 94 runs as Cali managed just 82.\nColombia hosted both the men and the women's edition of the South American Cricket Championship in 2018, although they took part in the men's tournament only, finishing at fourth place. The women's edition had WT20I status for the first time as per ICC's announcement."

Ateneo's Rabeh Al-Hussaini was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the season, while Nonoy Baclao was named as the Finals MVP. Ryan Buenafe won the Rookie of the Year honors, also for the Ateneo.\nPreseason.\nAboy Castro succeeds Joe Lipa as the new head coach of the UP Fighting Maroons, after Lipa led his team to a 0–14 record in Season 70.

Pacquiao was given Sports Excellence award by the UAAP Board while Arenas was on town on a promotional tour.\nOn July 24, 2008 FEU player Marnel \"Mac\" Baracael was shot and critically wounded near the FEU campus. The assailant used a caliber .45 pistol with a silencer. Baracael is now in stable condition; police speculate that the shooting maybe basketball-related. Baracael suited up for the Tamaraws in their game against NU, August 28, 2008.\nTeam standings.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's standings\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Men's standings\" /&gt;\nSchedule.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's schedule\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Men's schedule\" /&gt;\nResults.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's results\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Men's results\" /&gt;\nPostseason teams.\nAteneo Blue Eagles.\nAteneo opened the season against La Salle, eking out a six-point win 79-73. After an easy win against Adamson, the Eagles were taken to the edge by UE before winning. They won two more games until the sixth game against FEU. The Tamaraws seized the initiative in the endgame to deal Ateneo their first and only loss of the season even with Rabeh Al-Hussaini scoring half of Ateneo's 66 points. Ateneo won the next six games, including a close game versus UST, and an overtime win against UE in which Ryan Buenafe did the heroics over two UE centers, and a rout against NU, the last of which clinched them the twice to beat advantage in the semifinals. In the elimination round finale against the Green Archers they never let La Salle lead, en route to a 65-57 win against their arch-rivals. The 13-1 league leading Blue Eagles faced the 9-5 UE Red Warriors in the semifinals, and ended the fourth seed team's season, with a 70-50 win.\nDe La Salle Green Archers.\nAfter losing their first game against the Eagles, La Salle won five consecutive games. UE gave La Salle their second loss but La Salle won their next game also against the Red Warriors. La Salle won their next three games but lost to FEU. With head coach Franz Pumaren out of the country coaching the under-18 team in the FIBA Asia Under-18 Championship 2008, La Salle prevented overtime with a buzzer-beating put-back for the win against UST, and an overtime win against Adamson to ensure a semifinals berth. Pumaren returned to the country with still a game left at the U-18 tournament to coach the game against league-leading Ateneo Blue Eagles, which would be crucial for them to clinch the twice to beat advantage, even with FEU losing their final elimination game against UE, they lost the game against the Eagles. La Salle's leading scorer in Jvee Casio was being guarded well by the Eagles ended up having a nightmare game, sinking only two field goals out of 17 from the field. The Archers then won two straight games against FEU in the semifinals, thus eliminating the Tamaraws and going to the Finals.\nFEU Tamaraws.\nFEU survived their game against Adamson with a three-pointer to save the game for them. La Salle defeated them but they won their next two games against UP and UST. However, starting power forward Marnel \"Mac\" Baracael was shot outside school premises that caused him to be sidelined. In their next game against UE, FEU had a rally in the fourth quarter to give them an emphatic win. Riding their three-game winning streak, the Tamaraws defeated the Eagles as they held off the Eagles in the waning minutes of the fourth quarter.\nJust after they've won against the #1 team, the #8 team NU upset the Tamaraws who were then tied with three teams for #1. A sorry loss against Ateneo gave them their first losing streak, but an easy win against Adamson and a come from behind overtime win against UST put them back on track. With wins against La Salle, NU and UP, FEU clinched a semifinals berth. They will fight for a playoff game for the twice to beat advantage vs. La Salle since La Salle was beaten by Ateneo in the elimination round finale.\nUE Red Warriors.\nComing off a 14-0 elimination round sweep last year, UE continued their dominance of the elimination round with wins against UST and NU. However, fellow undefeated team Ateneo handed them their first defeat of the season. A shock loss against Adamson gave them their first elimination round losing streak in a year. Although they've won against cellar dweller UP, the loss against FEU placed them at .500. In a rematch of 2007 Finals, UE got some sort of vengeance as the defeated La Salle, but the Archers got payback as they met each other again four days later.\nWith wins against doormats UP and NU, UE gave Ateneo another dogfight but they came up short in overtime. Avenging their first round loss against Adamson, UE eliminated UST despite giving up their 24-point lead in the fourth quarter to clinch their semifinals berth.\nSecond-seed playoff.\nLa Salle and FEU ended tied for second; as a result, a playoff was held to determine which team will clinch the #2 seed and the twice-to-beat advantage that goes along with it, leading to a \"de facto\" first game of a best-of-three series.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's bracket\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Men's bracket\" /&gt;\nSemifinals.\nLa Salle and Ateneo have the twice-to-beat advantage. They only have to win once, while their opponents, twice, to progress.\nAteneo vs. UE.\nWith UE staying put in the first quarter, Ateneo marked a 16-0 rally late in the first that turned a 5-11 deficit to a 25-13 advantage late in the second quarter. Eric Salamat anchored the run, scoring nine points in that stretch. Freshman Ryan Buenafe's hard drive to the basket erected the Eagles' largest lead at 56-28. The Warriors managed to cut down the lead to twenty but the final deficit was good enough for the third-largest winning margin in Final Four history.\nLa Salle vs. FEU.\nAlthough the Tamaraws led for much of the game, La Salle came from behind to lead 64-62 with 35.2 remaining in the fourth quarter. Marnel \"Mac\" Baracael missed two free-throws that would've tied the game. After James Mangahas split his charities after a foul in the ensuing rebound play, Paul Sanga missed a desperation three-pointer. The rebound went to La Salle which capitalized with a fastbreak led by Mangahas to settle the final score and their second-consecutive Finals appearance.\nFinals.\nPrior to the finals, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) nabbed six ticket scalpers in the Araneta Coliseum for selling outrageously priced tickets. Both head coaches agreed that the officiating in the finals be fair and consistent. UAAP Commissioner Chito Narvasa has already listed 12 referees directly under his management for the series. La Salle head coach Franz Pumaren further remarked that the host school can prevent scalping if it helps in the accounting of tickets; the tickets for the first game were already sold out a week prior to the game.\nMeanwhile, security was tight at the Araneta Coliseum to prevent petty thieves from infiltrating the event. However, the security wasn't able to prevent thievery as members of the \"Salisi (theft) Gang\" were able to steal several items inside the coliseum at the first game.\nGame 1.\nAteneo opened the scoring with a strong first quarter, but La Salle caught up with them to cut the lead to three. La Salle then went on to lead, 29-26 off Casio's three-point play, but the Eagles launched a 10-0 run to lead at the half despite Chris Tiu, Eric Salamat and Nonoy Baclao spending time on the bench thanks to foul trouble. Rabeh Al-Hussaini had a monster second half, holding back a La Salle rally that cut the lead to six care of JV Casio and Bader Malabes as he scored Ateneo's next eight points to put the game away from the Archers for a game 1 victory.\nGame 1 tickets with a face value of P350 were being sold online for P50,300, and some bought tickets from scalpers for P25,000 for the same face value.\nGame 2.\nLa Salle started the game with an 8–3 scoreline, capped by a Simon Atkins three-pointer. Ateneo came back with their own 24–9 run to hold the lead 27–17 despite Al-Hussaini riding the bench with two personal fouls. Ateneo closed out the first half with another 8-0 run to lead 41-26. JV Casio cut the lead to three points in a 21-9 run that included six three-pointers by the third quarter. However, Rico Maierhofer was ejected from the game for incurring a second technical for flashing the dirty finger, but he claimed he was instructing a teammate to defend using the index finger. La Salle wasn't able to hold on, and Al-Hussaini scored all of his seven points in the third quarter to lead the Ateneo counter-attack. Things got exacerbated when Casio fouled out with 2:48 remaining. Ateneo had a 10-4 run in the final minutes, capped by a three-point play by Jai Reyes to clinch their fourth UAAP title.\nLa Salle coach Franz Pumaren lambasted the officials saying \"It's like a script, you know the ending. They should have just given the trophy right away.\" He further said that the officiating was \"the worst\" he has ever seen \"in the Finals\". Maierhofer was in tears as he walked towards the dugout; La Salle was called for 29 fouls, awarding Ateneo 28 free-throws of which they converted 18.\nAteneo's Nonoy Baclao was named Most Valuable Player of the finals after being the anchor of the Ateneo defense. Baclao scored eight points, grabbed 10 rebounds and blocked five shots in game 2 after scoring seven points, grabbing 7 rebounds and blocking 7 shots, including a crucial block to Maierhofer, in game 1.\nAwards.\nThe season's awardees were awarded on a ceremony prior to Game 2 of the finals at the Araneta Coliseum. They are:\nControversies.\nID controversy.\nAfter the Ateneo's first round defeat of La Salle, La Salle coach Franz Pumaren contested the technical given to him for not wearing his ID; previously, UST coach Pido Jarencio wasn't issued a technical when he wasn't wearing his ID. Pumaren labeled this as \"selective officiating.\" La Salle elevated the issue to the UAAP Board but refused to label it as a \"protest\". Jarencio for his part said that he is willing to accept any sanctions for not wearing his ID, including two technical free throws in their next game.\nAs a result of the controversy, Commissioner Narvasa suspended the three referees officiating in the Ateneo-La Salle game for one game for \"losing control of the ballgame.\" La Salle's league representative welcomed the sanctions \"but the sanction is for poor officiating; it has nothing to do with the technical foul called.\"\nSuspension of referee.\nAnother referee was suspended indefinitely by the National Amateur Basketball Referees Organization (NABRO, the organization handling the league referees) after the July 12 La Salle-FEU game. Bryan Tabañag made several errant calls that \"deprived FEU a fair chance to determine who the better team was,\" according to NABRO president Rolando Omampo. Tabañag is NABRO's vice-president.\nDespite the referee's suspension, the La Salle-FEU game won't be replayed."

It started with the Inter-Provincial First Class Tournament in 1990 because of the general idea that club cricket alone would be not enough to keep Sri Lanka cricket competitive.\nThe tournament stopped after the 1994–95 season but was revived 10 years later with the 2003–04 season and disestablished again in 2010. Sri Lanka remains today as the only Test cricket playing country to have club cricket as their form of first-class cricket with the Premier Trophy. The Inter-Provincial Limited Over Tournament and Inter-Provincial Twenty20 were created for the 2007–08 domestic season. The last First Class Tournament was held in 2009–10. The Twenty20 tournament was last held in 2011 and subsequently replaced by the Sri Lanka Premier League.\nHistory.\nFrom the tournament's inauguration, participating teams varied from year to year. 1990 the tournament started with four provincial teams. They were Western Province, Central Province, Southern Province and North Western Province. But in 1991 Western province as the major player contributor to Sri Lankan Cricket had two teams, the City team and the Suburb team. Then three teams in 1992 and therefore total teams participating was six. In 1993 Western Province presented three teams again as one City team and two suburban teams. After nearly 10 years of hiatus, the tournament revived in 2004. Teams yet again changed, only one team from the Western province and teams for North Central Province, Uva Province participated for the first time.

His father was an Army engineer stationed at West Point when he was born, but the family moved to Round Rock, Texas, before he was 2 years old.\nAt Round Rock High School, his career record was 43–3, and his team, the Dragons, won the Texas class 5A state championship in 1997.\nGordon and his wife, Amanda, have a daughter, Finley and a son, Riggs.\nProfessional career.\nGordon was drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 7th round of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft as an outfielder. With the Diamondbacks organization, he made it as high as Triple-A Tucson in and became a free agent after the season. Gordon signed with the Anaheim Angels where he played in the next two years with their Triple-A affiliate, Salt Lake Stingers. After the season, Gordon signed with the Houston Astros organization. Playing the entire year in Triple-A, he batted only .241, and after the season decided to convert to pitcher with the help of Hall-of-Famer Nolan Ryan, who was a special assistant to the Astros.\nGordon began with the Double-A Corpus Christi Hooks. In 30 relief appearances, he had an ERA of 2.88 and received a promotion to Triple-A Round Rock. In , Gordon started the season with Double-A Corpus Christi, but after just one appearance, he was released.

In his last home game before returning to the US, Gordon faced hard rivals Leones del Caracas in front of a crowd of 20,000, posting 8 innings with 1 allowed run and 9 strikeouts. After the game ended, all la Guaira fans shouted Brian's last name, with Gordon walking out of the dugout and kissing the team's shirt in one of La Guaira's most emotive moments of the season.\nGordon was granted free agency after the 2009 season and he signed with the Philadelphia Phillies for the 2010 season. He remained with the Phillies for the start of the 2011 season.\nOn June 14, 2011, Gordon opted out of his minor league contract with the Phillies and signed with the New York Yankees, who promoted him to the major leagues. In his first MLB start, Gordon pitched innings for the Yankees, allowing two earned runs in a Yankees 3–2 victory in 12 innings at Yankee Stadium. He made history by wearing a non-leather glove, the first major leaguer to do so.

        "text": "\"For the American musician, songwriter, and bandleader, see Wayne King.\"\nWayne Gordon King (born September 4, 1951) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey winger of Ojibwe descent who played in the National Hockey League for the California Golden Seals. Skating for the Seals' best farm team, the Salt Lake Golden Eagles of the Western Hockey League, King recorded 34 goals and 34 assists in the 1973–74 campaign. At the conclusion of the season, he was named to the WHL Second Team All-Star Right Wing as a left-shot who played on the opposing wing.\nEarly life.\nKing was born in Midland, Ontario, about an hour north of Toronto, but raised in Port McNicoll, Ontario as the son of an engineer father and stay-at-home mother. The King's were the only Native family in Port McNicoll, the parents having both lived on reserves, but moving into the larger community in search of work.\nAfter spending the 1976–77 season back in Salt Lake City, King joined the OHA senior Barrie Flyers, not far from his hometown. He averaged a point per game in 1977–78 for the Flyers then announced his retirement.\nCareer.\nKing reached the Ontario Hockey Association Finals while playing as a 17-year-old for the Midland Flyers Intermediate B team in 1968–69. In the same year, while trying out for the Junior B Owen Sound Greys, King was scouted by the owner and general manager of the Niagara Falls Flyers Junior A (OHL) team, Hap Emms, and spent the next two seasons playing for Niagara.\nKing was signed by the California Golden Seals, an expansion team in the National Hockey League. As a player he was known as a tough forward, an aggressive checker and an intrepid battler in the corners.\nHe made his pro debut with the Columbus Seals of the International Hockey League (1945–2001) during the 1971–72 season. The Seals were the initial farm team of the California Golden Seals, and King later played for the top farm team, the Salt Lake City Golden Seals in the Western Hockey League. It was during his 1973–74 season with Salt Lake City that King put up the best statistical season of his professional career, compiling 34 goals and 34 assists in 76 games. King played 25 games with the California Golden Seals of the NHL during the 1974–75 season before suffering a devastating knee injury, tearing ligaments during a collision with Mike Marson of the Washington Capitals. Prior to this injury, King had amassed four goals and seven assists on the year. This injury slowed his pursuit of an NHL career, but King did not give up, returning to play for California in 1975–76. It was announced in 1976 that the Golden Seals would be ceasing operations at the end of the season. King appeared in 46 games in the 1976–77 season and retired at the end of the year after receiving little interest from the other professional teams.\nKing worked in an auto body shop for two years starting in 1977. Following this, King began his post-hockey career, working as a mental health worker and security guard at the Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre, now known as the Waypoint Centre for Mental Health Care. During this time, King became a registered practical nurse, having completed a two-year program to receive the designation. As of 2004, King was employed by the government of Ontario and enjoyed playing golf in his free time.\nPersonal life.\nUpon retiring from hockey in 1978, King returned to his hometown of Midland, Ontario, to start a family with his wife, Shirley. The following year, 1979, they had their first child, a boy they named G.W. Four years later, in 1983, the Kings had another child, their daughter MaKala. King enjoyed playing hockey and fastball recreationally during his retirement, but due to a knee injury sustained during his professional career he no longer participates in these sports, but still golfs frequently."

The football team currently participates in the local league of San Isidro District, Lima.\nThe club is the \"de facto\" home of the Peru Cricket Association, and hosts the \"National T20 Cricket League\" during the summer months of January to April. It has also hosted a number of international tournaments, featuring the Peru national cricket team. The most recent was the \"South American Championship\" in April 2014, with competing teams from Argentina (men &amp; women), Brazil (men &amp; women), Chile and Mexico (men only).\nApart from football and cricket, nowadays the club hosts the practise of basketball, basque pelota, fencing, field hockey, squash, table tennis, tennis, swimming, volleyball, and water aerobics (rugby union is no longer practised). Other social activities include bocce, darts, pilates, snooker, and zumba.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded by English immigrants as the \"Lima Cricket Club\". From its start, the club hosted the practise of several sports such as cricket, rugby union, and football and tennis.\nOver time, other sports gained popularity within the club, and thus its name several times such as in 1865 to \"Lima Cricket and Lawn Tennis Club\" (when it merged with a local tennis club) and to \"Lima Cricket and Football Club\" in 1906 (although another source dates this as 1900).\nDespite its members having played football since its origins, the first recorded football match was on August 7, 1892. Following on this event, the club now officially added a football-departement in 1893. It took on the current name on April 30, 1906. Lima Cricket went on to inspire future football clubs in Peru, such as Union Cricket.\nAs Lima C&amp;FC was part of an elite football clubs composed entirely of high-society families, unlike other raising clubs that accepted members and players from popular sectors of Lima. This was notable since the beginning of the 1920s. As a result, Limas CFC would be relegated from the top ranks at the hands of clubs that recruited their players from a much larger pool.\nRivalries.\nHis first rivalry was with the Ciclista Lima who dispute the (Classic of Yesteryear)."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball players with a .400 batting average in a season",
        "text": "In baseball, batting average (AVG) is a measure of a batter's success rate in achieving a hit during an at bat, and is calculated by dividing a player's hits by his at bats. The achievement of a .400 batting average in a season is recognized as the coveted \"standard of hitting excellence\", in light of how batting .300 in a season is already regarded as solid. Forty-two players have recorded a batting average of at least .400 in a single Major League Baseball (MLB) season as of 2023, but none have done so for more than 75 years. The last to do so were Bill Terry in the National League (1930), Ted Williams in the American League (1941), and Willard Brown and Artie Wilson in the Negro American League (1948). Five players – Ed Delahanty, Ty Cobb, Rogers Hornsby, Oscar Charleston, and Josh Gibson– have accomplished the feat in three different seasons, the highest batting average for a single season was .4711 single-season record established by Tetelo Vargas in 1943. Ross Barnes was the first player to bat .400 in a season, posting a .429 batting average in the National League's inaugural 1876 season.\nIn total, 42 players have reached the .400 mark in MLB history and nine have done so more than once. Of these, twenty one were right-handed batters, nineteen were left-handed, and two were switch hitter, meaning they could bat from either side of the plate. Three of these players (Terry, Leonard and Williams) played for only one major league team. The Philadelphia Phillies are the only franchise to have four players reach the milestone while on their roster: Delahanty, Billy Hamilton, Sam Thompson, and Tuck Turner, all of whom attained a batting average over .400 during the 1894 season. Three players won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award in the same year as their .400 season. Tip O'Neill, Nap Lajoie, Josh Gibson, Willie Wells, Mule Suttles, Oscar Charleston (3 times), Heavy Johnson and Rogers Hornsby (twice) also earned the Triple Crown alongside achieving a .400 batting average, leading their respective leagues in batting average, home runs and runs batted in (RBI). Although Ray Dandridge's .432 batting average in 1934 did not earn him the Negro National League's batting title, it established a major league record for a rookie that stands to this day. Fred Dunlap has the lowest career batting average among players who have batted .400 in a season with .292, while Cobb – with .366 – recorded the highest career average in major league history.\nGiven the decades that have elapsed since Brown and Wilson became the last players to achieve the feat and the integral changes to the way the game of baseball is played since then – such as the increased utilization of specialized relief pitchers – a writer for \"The Washington Post\" called the mark \"both mystical and unattainable\". Consequently, modern day attempts to reach the hallowed mark by Rod Carew (.388 in 1977), George Brett (.390 in 1980) and Tony Gwynn (.394 in the strike-shortened 1994 season) have generated considerable hype among fans and in the media. Of the thirty-four players eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame who have batted .400 in a season, twenty-four have been elected and two were elected on the first ballot. Players are eligible for the Hall of Fame if they have played in at least 10 MLB seasons, and have either been retired for five seasons or deceased for at least six months. These requirements leave seven players ineligible who did not play in at least 10 seasons. Shoeless Joe Jackson is ineligible for the Hall of Fame because he was permanently banned from baseball in 1921 for his involvement in the Black Sox Scandal.\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

        "text": "Aaron Curry (born April 6, 1986) is an American college football coach and former linebacker who is the inside linebackers coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL). Curry was drafted by the Seattle Seahawks in the first round (fourth overall) in the 2009 NFL Draft out of Wake Forest. Curry also played for the Oakland Raiders in 2011 and 2012.\nEarly years.\nCurry attended E. E. Smith High School in Fayetteville, North Carolina. While there he played linebacker and tight end. He earned all-conference and all-region honors and was the conference's defensive player of the year as a senior after recording 123 tackles. He was also selected to the North Carolina–South Carolina Shrine Bowl as a tight end.\nConsidered only a two-star recruit by both \"Rivals\" and \"Scout.com\", Curry chose to play college football at Wake Forest over East Carolina, the only two scholarships he was offered. Curry said he chose Wake Forest in part because it was two hours from home, but mostly for revenge. \"Anybody who passed me up, I was going to punish them. That's why I chose the ACC, [because] those schools like Carolina, Duke, and North Carolina State were right around the corner, and I wasn't wanted by any of them.\"\nCollege career.\nAs a freshman in 2005 he started 10 of 11 games and was the team's fifth leading tackler with 39. After his great season he was named second-team Freshman All-American and ACC All-Freshman Team by the \"Sporting News\". As a sophomore in 2006 he started all 14 games at outside linebacker, finishing second on the team in tackles with 83. Curry's breakout season came as a junior in 2007. During the season, he tied the NCAA record for the most interception returns for touchdown in a season by a linebacker with three. He also broke the school record with 226 interception return yards. He finished the season second on the team and 13th in the ACC in tackles with 99, and earned Second-team All-ACC honors and second-team All-America honors from CollegeSportsReport.com. Curry seriously considered entering the 2008 NFL Draft to provide for his family, but later chose to return.\nIn his senior season, he had 105 tackles, including 16 for a loss, and was the winner of the Butkus Award. Curry was also selected an All-American by ESPN, \"Pro Football Weekly\", and \"Sports Illustrated\".\nCurry graduated in 2009 with a bachelor's degree in sociology.\nPlaying career.\n2009 NFL Draft.\nCurry was widely believed to be the best linebacker available in the 2009 NFL Draft. Considered a \"safe pick\", he was even in the debate for the No. 1 pick overall—which would've made him the first linebacker selected first overall since Aundray Bruce in 1988. ESPN's Mel Kiper, Jr. compared Curry to Keith Bulluck.\nCurry was drafted in the first round with the fourth overall pick by the Seattle Seahawks in the 2009 NFL Draft. He was the highest drafted linebacker since LaVar Arrington went second overall in the 2000 NFL Draft to the Washington Redskins, and the highest Wake Forest Demon Deacon since Norm Snead went second overall to the Washington Redskins in the 1961 NFL Draft.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nOn August 8, 2009, Curry signed a six-year, $60 million contract including $34 million guaranteed, the most money ever guaranteed to a non-quarterback rookie in NFL history.\nCurry became the starting strongside linebacker for the Seahawks immediately. In his first career game against the St. Louis Rams he recorded four tackles. He recorded his first career sack against Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler in week 3.\nIn 2009, Curry recorded 61 tackles and 2 sacks, and in 2010, he compiled 73 tackles and 3.5 sacks. In 2011, he lost his starting position to rookie K. J. Wright after just two starts. Since he failed to meet the expectations of a high draft pick, Curry is widely considered to be a draft bust.\nOakland Raiders.\nCurry was traded to the Oakland Raiders on October 12, 2011, in exchange for a seventh-round draft pick in 2012 and a conditional pick in 2013, a salary dump. On November 16, 2012, Curry was fined $23,625 for two offenses against the Baltimore Ravens.\nOn November 20, 2012, Curry was waived by the Oakland Raiders after spending all but two weeks of the 2012 season on the physically unable to perform (PUP) list.\nNew York Giants.\nCurry signed a one-year deal with the New York Giants on May 10, 2013. On August 25, 2013, the Giants released Curry to trim down the 75 man roster. On August 28, 2013, Curry retired from the NFL.\nNFL statistics.\nKey\nCoaching career.\nCharlotte 49ers.\nCurry joined the Charlotte 49ers coaching staff under his former college linebackers coach Brad Lambert in 2014 as a graduate assistant. The next year, he was promoted to defensive line coach.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nCurry joined the Seahawks coaching staff on March 11, 2020 as a defensive assistant after spending the 2019 season as a coaching assistant.\nPittsburgh Steelers.\nOn February 22, 2023, Curry was hired as an inside linebackers coach by the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nPersonal.\nCurry is the son of former Detroit Lions and Baltimore Colts defensive back Reggie Pinkney; he has had a minimal relationship with his father. His brother is former NFL linebacker Eric Barton.\nCurry currently resides in North Carolina."

        "text": "Rugby Québec is the popular name of the Fédération de Rugby du Québec (formerly the Québec Rugby Union) which is the provincial governing body for the sport of rugby union in the Canadian province of Québec. The Fédération de Rugby du Québec is affiliated with the Canadian Rugby Union.\nThe Fédération de Rugby du Québec origins are hard to trace for two reasons. First, rugby union in Canada converged with and then later split from the game of Canadian football, often with rugby football unions representing both games, thus making an exact history hard to establish. Second, the Fédération de Rugby du Québec has not put a great emphasis on maintaining detailed historical records. This has led to gaps in its administrative and competition history and the lost information may never be known.\nThe Westmount Rugby Club traces its roots back to 1876 or 1878, and some sort of organized rugby has been played in Québec ever since. In the 1920s and 1930s many clubs made the transition to professional or semi-professional football. Regardless, several leagues were formed during the 1950s that were not associated with the Québec Rugby Union. This changed in the later 1960s and in the late 1970s the union officially changed its name to the Fédération de Rugby du Québec.\nThe FRQ has many differing levels and types of competition. There are two predominate competitions that have the longest historical record. The first is the \"Premier Championship Cup\", which is awarded annually to the best rugby team in cup competition. This has also been known as the \"Quebec Cup\", \"Senior Cup\", the \"First Division Cup\", the \"A Division Cup\" and (formerly) the \"Standard Life Cup\" and can trace its origins back to the 1950s. The second oldest championship is the \"Intermediate Cup\", awarded to the best club team in the \"second side\" cup competition. This has also been known as the \"Second Division Cup\", the \"B Division Cup\" and the \"Des O'Neill Trophy\".\nOriginal clubs.\nAs leagues in Montréal and the \"St. Lawrence Rugger and Cricket Association\" were formed, the first cohort of modern clubs was founded.\nFirst Expansion.\nThe union began to expand in the 1970s and 1980s, with its first wave of new clubs. Additionally, for a good part of the 1970s several Ottawa based rugby teams regularly completed in the QRU, including the Ottawa Indians, Ottawa Irish, Ottawa Beavers, Ottawa Scottish and the Deep River Blues. Of particular importance was the entry of the Club de rugby Parc olympique into the FRQ, as it was the first primarily francophone team in the federation.\nRecent Expansion.\nThe FRQ experienced substantial growth in the past two decades, and has added many new clubs, especially because rugby now enjoys a much greater popularity in French language school boards.\nTwo teams, the \"Chateauguay Hammerheads\" and \"Hudson Highlanders\", played at the turn of the century, but have folded."

        "text": "The 2009 Australian Open was a tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts. It was the 97th edition of the Australian Open, and the first Grand Slam event of the year. It took place at the Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Australia, from 19 January through 1 February 2009. The tournament is remembered for containing many notable matches of the 2009 year, including the Nadal v Verdasco semi final and the Nadal v Federer final. It was the first hard court Grand Slam in which Nadal made the final or won.\nNovak Djokovic and Maria Sharapova were the defending champions. Djokovic was forced to retire in his quarter-final match against Andy Roddick due to heat stress, ending his title defence, whilst Sharapova chose not to defend her title due to long lasting shoulder surgery; the withdrawal subsequently dropped her out of the WTA's Top 10 for the first time since July 2004.\nSecond seeded Serena Williams regained the women's singles title and recorded her fourth Australian Open title and tenth Grand Slam title overall after defeating third seed Dinara Safina in straight sets. Serena, partnering with her sister Venus, also won the women's doubles tournament.\nFirst seeded Rafael Nadal defeated Roger Federer in five sets to win the men's singles title. This was Nadal's first hard court grand slam title, having previously only won on clay at Roland Garros four times and grass at Wimbledon once. He also became the first Spaniard to ever win the Australian Open. This tournament featured 23 five-set men's singles matches, the most since 1988. In men's doubles, another sibling pair took the title as Bob and Mike Bryan defeated Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles.\nThis tournament was notable for being the warmest tournament weather-wise; the average daily maximum temperature throughout the tournament was 34.7 degrees Celsius, nine degrees above normal. The coolest Australian Open was in 1986, when the maximum temperature averaged just 22.5 degrees Celsius, 3.5 degrees below normal.\nDay-by-day summaries.\nDay 1 (19 January).\nDay one's play began with 7th seeded Andy Roddick easing through to the 2nd round in Rod Laver Arena in straight sets. Later defending champion and 3rd seeded Novak Djokovic also made it to the second round, as well as seeded players Juan Martín del Potro, Marat Safin, Tomáš Berdych, Mardy Fish, Philipp Kohlschreiber, Robin Söderling, Paul-Henri Mathieu, Tommy Robredo, Stanislas Wawrinka, Marin Čilić, while 11th seeded David Ferrer was made to work hard before prevailing in five sets over Denis Gremelmayr. 2006 finalist Marcos Baghdatis also progressed in straight sets, while Australia's defending boy's champion Bernard Tomic won a four set encounter on his debut. Later in the evening, 10th seeded David Nalbandian dropped a set but eventually defeated Frenchman Marc Gicquel, while three-time champion 2nd seed Roger Federer won the first set easily, but was made to work hard in the next two sets, before defeating Italian Andreas Seppi on his fifth match point. 27th seed Feliciano López was the only seed to fall, losing to 2008 US Open quarterfinalist, Luxembourg's Gilles Müller in a five set thriller that ended 16–14 in the fifth. The match was originally thought to be the longest in the history of the Australian Open, spanning over 5 hours and 34 minutes. However, it was later discovered that a timing error had added over an hour to the match, that in reality lasted 4 hours and 24 minutes. The semifinal match between Rafael Nadal and Fernando Verdasco did become the longest, however, at 5 hours and 14 minutes.\nIn the women's singles, last year's finalist and 5th seeded Ana Ivanovic began her campaign with a hard earned straight sets victory, while compatriot and top seed Jelena Janković was an easy winner over Yvonne Meusburger. Other players following the Serbian duo into the second round include 3rd seed Dinara Safina, 7th seed Vera Zvonareva, Caroline Wozniacki, Alizé Cornet, Nadia Petrova, Marion Bartoli, Anna Chakvetadze, Alisa Kleybanova and Ai Sugiyama. 25th seeded Estonian Kaia Kanepi halted the progress of former world number four Kimiko Date-Krumm, playing in the main draw of a Grand Slam for the first time in 13 years, in three tight sets, while last year's semifinalist Daniela Hantuchová defeated local hope Casey Dellacqua in straight sets. Another former world number four, unseeded Australian Jelena Dokić also moved into the second round for the first time in ten years with a hard-fought victory over Tamira Paszek. Meanwhile, 23rd seed Ágnes Szávay's poor form in Grand Slams continued as she crashed out to Galina Voskoboeva, 24th seed Sybille Bammer lost to Lucie Šafářová, while Sara Errani defeated 27th seed Maria Kirilenko.\nDay 2 (20 January).\nWith temperatures soaring in Melbourne, Andy Murray had life made easy in his first round match when opponent Andrei Pavel was forced to concede with a back injury early in the second set, having lost the first. Other top-ten seeds such as last year's finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Gilles Simon and James Blake also progressed comfortably, along with Gaël Monfils, Fernando Verdasco, Richard Gasquet, Jürgen Melzer, Ivo Karlović and Radek Štěpánek, while Igor Andreev and Nicolás Almagro both won through in five sets. In a five-set thriller that lasted three hours and seven minutes, former finalist and 13th seed Fernando González overcame home-crowd favorite Lleyton Hewitt. Later on, top-seed Rafael Nadal posted a 6–0, 6–2, 6–2 win against Christophe Rochus that tied with Andy Roddick's first-round score, establishing himself and Roddick as the most dominant male performers of the first round.

Defending champion and 3rd seed Novak Djokovic progressed with a straight sets victory over Jérémy Chardy, while second seed Roger Federer breezed past 118th-ranked Russian Evgeny Korolev 6–2, 6–3, 6–1 at Rod Laver Arena, which sets up a third-round match with Marat Safin, who recovered from a slow start to beat Guillermo García López 7–5, 6–2, 6–2. Andy Roddick also needed four sets to get past Xavier Malisse, while Juan Martín del Potro eased into the third round, along with Marin Čilić, David Ferrer, Stanislas Wawrinka, Mardy Fish, Tomáš Berdych and Tommy Robredo. In the biggest upset in the men's tournament up to this point, unseeded Yen-hsun Lu defeated 10th-seeded David Nalbandian in five sets. 16th-seeded Robin Söderling was also upset by unseeded former finalist Marcos Baghdatis in four, while lucky loser Amer Delić prevailed in five sets against 28th seed Paul-Henri Mathieu and French veteran Fabrice Santoro came from behind to defeat Philipp Kohlschreiber. In the feature night match at Rod Laver Arena, sixteen-year-old Bernard Tomic took the first set against Gilles Müller but eventually lost 3–6, 6–1, 6–4, 6–2 to the more experienced Luxembourgian.\nIn the women's draw, it was a perfect day for the seeds, with the exception of 17th-seeded Anna Chakvetadze, who lost a sensational 3-set encounter to Jelena Dokić, the latter continuing with her comeback and set up a third round clash with Danish teenager, 11th seed Caroline Wozniacki after some questionable decisions by Fred Mather. Top seed Jelena Janković encountered resistance against Kirsten Flipkens but eventually won 6–4, 7–5, while Ana Ivanovic had an easier time against qualifier Alberta Brianti. Third seed Dinara Safina also needed to come back from one set down to beat Ekaterina Makarova, while Vera Zvonareva crushed Edina Gallovits 6–0, 6–0, and Nadia Petrova defeat Sania Mirza in straight sets. Also through to the third round are Alizé Cornet, Daniela Hantuchová, Marion Bartoli, Ai Sugiyama, Kaia Kanepi and Alisa Kleybanova.\nThe doubles matches also began, with most of the seeds in action passing their first tests, including Bob and Mike Bryan, Jeff Coetzee/Wesley Moodie, Mariusz Fyrstenberg/Marcin Matkowski, Bruno Soares/Kevin Ullyett, Max Mirnyi/Andy Ram, Travis Parrott/Filip Polášek, František Čermák/Michal Mertiňák and Christopher Kas/Rogier Wassen, as well as Yan Zi/Zheng Jie, Samantha Stosur/Rennae Stubbs, Maria Kirilenko/Flavia Pennetta, Casey Dellacqua/Francesca Schiavone, Hsieh Su-wei/Peng Shuai and Tatiana Poutchek/Anastasia Rodionova in the women's side. In the three sister pairings in action, 10th seeds Venus and Serena Williams swept aside Svetlana Kuznetsova and Nadia Petrova, unseeded Agnieszka and Urszula Radwańska defeat Jill Craybas and Tamarine Tanasugarn, but 4th seeds and defending champions Alona and Kateryna Bondarenko became the highest seeds to fall in the women doubles competition so far, losing in straight sets to Gisela Dulko/Roberta Vinci.\nDay 4 (22 January).\nDay four saw the conclusion of all second round matches in the singles competition. In the men's draw, top seed Rafael Nadal continued on his quest for a first Australian Open crown without too much trouble from Roko Karanušić, winning through in straight sets 6–2, 6–3, 6–2. Likewise, an in-form 4th seed Andy Murray eased into the 3rd round by defeating Marcel Granollers 6–4, 6–2, 6–2. Other top ten seeds that moved on included 5th seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and 6th seed Gilles Simon, both dropping a first set tiebreak but went on to win the next three sets, and 9th seed James Blake, who cruised past Sébastien de Chaunac. Gaël Monfils, Fernando González, Fernando Verdasco, Richard Gasquet, Nicolás Almagro, Radek Štěpánek, Jürgen Melzer and Igor Andreev all won through, while Ivo Karlović was the only seed to fall in the men's draw, losing to compatriot Mario Ančić after surrendering a two sets to one lead.\nUnseeded Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro scored the biggest upset to date in women's singles, defeating one of the pre-tournament favourites, 6th seeded Venus Williams 2–6, 6–3, 7–5, after coming back from 5–2 down and saving one match point while serving at 5–4 down in the third set. Venus' younger sister, second seeded Serena Williams had to work hard to dispatch Argentina's Gisela Dulko, saving six set points, while Dulko served for the second set at 5–3 in a game that featured 12 deuces, then fought through six more deuces to lead 6–5 and eventually won 6–3, 7–5. 4th seed Elena Dementieva extended her winning streak in the new season to 12 matches with a win over Iveta Benešová, and Svetlana Kuznetsova, Amélie Mauresmo, Victoria Azarenka, Dominika Cibulková, Zheng Jie, Flavia Pennetta, Anabel Medina Garrigues and Alona Bondarenko all moved on to the third round, while Swiss 14th seed Patty Schnyder fell to Virginie Razzano. Unseeded local hope Samantha Stosur also won.\nMajority of the first round matches in the doubles competition also ended. Top seeds Daniel Nestor/Nenad Zimonjić led a charge of seeded pairs to the second round, including Mahesh Bhupathi/Mark Knowles, Leander Paes/Lukáš Dlouhý, Marcelo Melo/André Sá and Martin Damm/Robert Lindstedt, while in the women's competition co-world number ones Cara Black and Liezel Huber eased into the second round, along with seeds Anabel Medina Garrigues/Virginia Ruano Pascual, Květa Peschke/Lisa Raymond, Daniela Hantuchová/Ai Sugiyama, Victoria Azarenka/Vera Zvonareva, Nuria Llagostera Vives/María José Martínez Sánchez and Sorana Cîrstea/Monica Niculescu, meaning no seeds fell in the women's doubles that day.\nDay 5 (23 January).\nDay five of the tournament saw the commencement of third round matches in the singles event, where seed started playing against each other. In men's singles, defending champion Novak Djokovic was made to work hard against his Bosnian-born American opponent, lucky loser Amer Delić, but eventually saw off his opponent in four tough sets. 8th seeded Juan Martín del Potro was heavily tested by unseeded Gilles Müller as well, but prevailed in four sets as well, while 7th seed Andy Roddick continued on a collision course with Djokovic with an easier passage against Fabrice Santoro, winning in straight sets and firing 22 aces along his way to just four by the Frenchman. Marin Čilić continued his fine form by defeating last year's quarterfinalist, 11th seed David Ferrer, while Tommy Robredo ended the journey of Yen-hsun Lu with an easy victory, and Tomáš Berdych created a minor upset by defeating 15th seed Stanislas Wawrinka in four. Later at night, Roger Federer clashed with Marat Safin in a repeat of the 2004 finals and 2005 semifinals in an exciting matchup in Rod Laver Arena. The second seed was on form and sent out a strong signal to his rivals with a convincing 6–3, 6–2, 7–6(5) victory. 2006 finalist Marcos Baghdatis also sent 23rd seed Mardy Fish packing with a straight sets victory and set up a fourth round clash with Djokovic.\nIn the women's draw, following Venus William's exit the day before, Ana Ivanovic replaced her as the highest seed to fall so far, losing 5–7, 7–6(5), 2–6 to 29th seed Alisa Kleybanova. Ivanovic, finalist last year broke Kleybanova in 10th game of the second set when the latter was serving for the match, and brought the match to the decider by winning a tiebreak, but ultimately conceded the match to her younger Russian opponent as Kleybanova ran away with a 6–2 victory in the third. Earlier in the night session, Jelena Dokić continued her fairytale comeback to Grand Slam tennis by upsetting 11th seeded Danish teenager Caroline Wozniacki, despite losing the first set she bounced back strongly to take the next two 6–1, 6–2, and will meet Kleybanova next. Elsewhere, earlier in the day, it was business as usual for the top 16 seeds. Top seed Jelena Janković was once again tested but overcame the heat and Ai Sugiyama in straight sets, and will face Marion Bartoli next, the Frenchwoman coming back from one set down to beat Lucie Šafářová. Dinara Safina also displayed her form and cruise past Kaia Kanepi with the loss of just four games, playing 15th seed Alizé Cornet next, after Cornet recovered from one set down to knock out last year's semifinalist Daniela Hantuchová. 10th seed Nadia Petrova was the first to advance after winning one set against Galina Voskoboeva, after which the latter retired with an injury, and set up a last 16 clash with Vera Zvonareva, who eased past Sara Errani.\nIn men's doubles action, the upset of the day was created by unseeded Łukasz Kubot and Oliver Marach, when they knocked out the top seeds Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjić in straight sets, in a day of upsets for the men's doubles which saw a total of five seeds being knocked out of the competition, including defending champion Andy Ram, partnering Max Mirnyi this year, crashing out to Spanish Davis Cup winning pair of Feliciano López and Fernando Verdasco. Seeds moved on in the women's doubles, with the exception of Tatiana Poutchek and Anastasia Rodionova, who lost to Anna-Lena Grönefeld and Patty Schnyder. Mixed doubles competition also began, but none of the seeds in action made it to the second round, with Alona Bondarenko/André Sá losing a match tie-break to Alizé Cornet/Marcelo Melo, Květa Peschke/Pavel Vízner losing to last year's finalists Sania Mirza/Mahesh Bhupathi, and Kateryna Bondarenko/Jordan Kerr defeated by Jarmila Gajdošová/Samuel Groth.\nDay 6 (24 January).\nThe top seeds in the upper half of the men's draw did not have much trouble in progressing into the last 16. Rafael Nadal made it to the next round with a solid 6–4, 6–2, 6–2 victory over former World No. 2 Tommy Haas, producing over 50 winners and just eight unforced errors. 13th seed Fernando González is up next for the Spaniard, after the latter came back from the dead against 24th seeded Frenchman Richard Gasquet in a 249-minute thriller, in which both players exhibit barrages of winners, and a gripping third set tiebreak in which both had opportunities to take the set, or the match for Gasquet, and eventually it was González who prevailed 12–10 in the decider. Andy Murray comfortably won his match against Jürgen Melzer as well, 7–5, 6–0, 6–3, and set up a tie with 14th seed Fernando Verdasco. The Spaniard was clearly on form as he completed a 6–4, 6–0, 6–0 thrashing of Radek Štěpánek, the same player who beat him in the Brisbane International final just two weeks before. Gilles Simon and Gaël Monfils set up an all-French fourth round encounter after powering past their opponents, unseeded Croat Mario Ančić and 17th seed Nicolás Almagro. In contrast, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga need to overcome a third set lapse before defeating Dudi Sela in four and will play James Blake in the last 16, who dropped one set against Igor Andreev as well.\nSerena Williams was the first among the women seeds to progress to the last 16 in Day Six, firing 10 aces on her way to a 6–1, 6–4 win over Chinese Peng Shuai. Belarusian teenager Victoria Azarenka awaits her in the next round, the 13th seed sending the only other former champion in the draw, 20th seed Amélie Mauresmo packing in a closely fought contest. Elena Dementieva continued on her excellent form this season, this time edging local hope Samantha Stosur in two tight sets, 7–6(6), 6–4, to set up a tie with another teenage star, 18th seed Dominika Cibulková, who defeat Virginie Razzano in straight sets to progress to the last 16 of a Grand Slam for the first time. Svetlana Kuznetsova is also through to the next round, overcoming 68 unforced errors from her racket to beat Alona Bondarenko. Alona's sister Kateryna also lost, crushed 6–2, 6–2 by Wimbledon semifinalist Zheng Jie, who will now play Kuznetsova. Elsewhere, Anabel Medina Garrigues posted a minor upset by powering past 12th seed Flavia Pennetta, and will now play unseeded Carla Suárez Navarro, Venus Williams' victor who cruised past compatriot María José Martínez Sánchez.\nSeeds continued to tumble in the second round of the men's doubles, including 5th seeds Wesley Moodie and Jeff Coetzee, who lost to local wildcards Joseph Sirianni and Andrew Coelho, František Čermák/Michal Mertiňák losing to another local pairing in Paul Hanley/Jordan Kerr, and Martin Damm/Robert Lindstedt, who were upset by Mardy Fish/John Isner, while former champions Bob and Mike Bryan are safely through. Women's top seeds Cara Black and Liezel Huber went through to the next round as well, along with Victoria Azarenka/Vera Zvonareva, Daniela Hantuchová/Ai Sugiyama, Květa Peschke/Lisa Raymond while Sorana Cîrstea/Monica Niculescu fell to Nathalie Dechy/Mara Santangelo.\nThe seeds also went 1–1 in the first round of mixed doubles competition, with second seeds Yan Zi/Mark Knowles defeating Nadia Petrova/Max Mirnyi while third seeds Lisa Raymond/Marcin Matkowski losing to Iveta Benešová/Lukáš Dlouhý.\nDay 7 (25 January).\n4th round matches begin with 8th seed Juan Martín del Potro advancing into his first Australian Open quarterfinals after recovering from a one set deficit to beat 19th seeded Marin Čilić. Both players were tipped to be highly successful in the future, but it was del Potro who stood firm with less error count as he prevailed 5–7, 6–4, 6–4, 6–2 and will play three-time champion, world no. 2 Roger Federer. Federer himself survived the challenge from 20th seeded Tomáš Berdych, who have not beaten him since their first encounter in the 2004 Athens Olympic Games. Berdych looked sharper of the two, showing little nerves as he went two sets up, but Federer came out firing from the third set onwards, and eventually came through safely, winning 4–6, 6–7(4), 6–4, 6–4, 6–2. 7th seed Andy Roddick also moved on to the quarterfinals with a comprehensive 7–5, 6–1, 6–3 victory over Tommy Robredo, and will play defending champion Novak Djokovic for a place in his 4th Australian Open semifinals. Djokovic looked impressive early on against former finalist Marcos Baghdatis, racing to a 6–1 first set victory, but the Cypriot gave him a much harder time, though giving up a one-break lead in the second set to lose a tiebreak and winning another third set tiebreak. However, the defending champion was too hot to handle and eventually by 2.30 am, Djokovic has sealed a 6–1, 7–6(1), 6–7(5), 6–2 victory in over three hours.\nIn the women's draw, top seeded Jelena Janković's quest for a maiden Grand Slam title came to a premature end in one of the shocks of the day, as 16th seed Marion Bartoli displayed her best tennis in two sets to dump the Serbian 6–1, 6–4, meaning Janković's world number one crown could be in danger. 7th seeded Vera Zvonareva also made it to her first Australian Open semifinals, after coming through in two tough sets against compatriot and 10th seeded Nadia Petrova, 7–5, 6–4. 3rd seed Dinara Safina almost followed Janković's path out of the tournament, as she survived two match points against Alizé Cornet, who was serving for the match while 2–6, 6–2, 5–4 up, but eventually lost the decider 7–5. Safina's opponent in the quarterfinals would be a resurgent Jelena Dokić, who, in the first match of the night session in Rod Laver Arena, defeated 29th seed Alisa Kleybanova in a three-hour match, 7–5, 5–7, 8–6, despite needing a medical time out towards the end of the decider. The Australian hang tough to break Kleybanova to love in the final game, sealing a famous win.\nDoubles play continue with 2nd seeds Bob and Mike Bryan progressing to a quarterfinal clash against compatriots Mardy Fish and John Isner, who sent 7th seeds Bruno Soares/Kevin Ullyett out of the tournament. 6th seeded Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski and unseeded Feliciano López/Fernando Verdasco also advanced to the quarterfinals. The top women seeds were not as lucky as four of the top eight pairs were sent crashing out, with Anabel Medina Garrigues/Virginia Ruano Pascual suffering a heavy defeat at the hands of 16th seeds Peng Shuai/Hsieh Su-wei, 3rd seeds Květa Peschke/Lisa Raymond losing to Nathalie Dechy/Mara Santangelo, 5th seeds Rennae Stubbs/Samantha Stosur defeated by Venus and Serena Williams while 6th seeds Yan Zi/Zheng Jie lost to Nuria Llagostera Vives/María José Martínez Sánchez.\nDay 8 (26 January).\nDay eight saw the remaining fourth round men's matches with a warm forecast to complement Australia Day. However it was quite a disappointing day with three seeded players from both men and women's draw retiring due to various reasons. In Rod Laver Arena, 6th seeded Gilles Simon battled against his in-form countrymen, 12th seed Gaël Monfils, with Simon taking the first set 6–4 only for Monfils to hit back 6–2. However, he began to show signs of suffering in the third set and after a medical timeout while 4–1 down and eventually losing the set, Monfils retired citing a wrist injury, sending Simon to his first Grand Slam quarterfinals, where he will face top seed Rafael Nadal. Nadal appeared to be in complete control over Fernando González, easily winning the first two sets and coming through the third set with heavier resistance from the Chilean, but the Spaniard never looked in doubt in his quest for a first Australian Open title. However, the surprise of the day came when 4th seeded Andy Murray, tipped by many as a favourite to win the title, crashed out to an in-form Fernando Verdasco, despite leading by 2 sets to 1. Verdasco, who had only lost twelve games on his way to the fourth round, came out firing in the last two sets, serving with astonishing accuracy, and won 85% of his first serves to outlast the Scot 2–6, 6–1, 1–6, 6–3, 6–4, and set up a quarterfinal tie with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who sent James Blake packing with a straight sets victory, meaning Murray was the only top eight seed to not make it to the quarterfinals.\nIn the women's draw, following Monfils' withdrawal earlier on, Victoria Azarenka and Serena Williams took the court earlier than expected, and it was the young Belarusian who made the better start, breaking the three-time champion twice to take the first set 6–3. However, after a missing chances to go 2–0 up in the second, Azarenka started to show signs of discomfort and was broken instead to trail 3–2, and a medical timeout couldn't do the wonders as the youngster retired in tears after another game. Azarenka later explained that she had been throwing up all morning and was feeling weak, but thought she could play after feeling better before her game, but ultimately succumbed. Williams went through to the quarterfinals, where she will play 8th seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova, who benefited from yet another withdrawal, in the form of 22nd seed Zheng Jie, who retired after five games with a wrist injury she picked up in the third game after falling and landing awkwardly on her hand. Elena Dementieva advanced with her fourteenth win of the season, this time dominating Slovakia's 18th seed Dominika Cibulková, 6–2, 6–2, and will play another giantkiller, unseeded Carla Suárez Navarro in the quarterfinals, the latter easily dispatching compatriot and 21st seed Anabel Medina Garrigues 6–3, 6–2 earlier in the day.\nIn men's doubles, 4th seeds Lukáš Dlouhý and Leander Paes advanced into the quarterfinals after defeating local pairing of Paul Hanley/Jordan Kerr, while Joseph Sirianni/Andrew Coelho also lost to Simone Bolelli/Andreas Seppi. 3rd seeds Mahesh Bhupathi/Mark Knowles and unseeded Łukasz Kubot/Oliver Marach filled in the remaining quarterfinal slots with straight sets victory over their respective opponents. In the women's side, top seeded Cara Black and Liezel Huber advanced after Victoria Azarenka, partnering Vera Zvonareva pulled out with an illness, and 7th seeds Flavia Pennetta/Maria Kirilenko also conceded a walkover to Casey Dellacqua/Francesca Schiavone due to Pennetta suffering from right foot bursitis. 9th seeds Daniela Hantuchová/Ai Sugiyama won through easily against Ágnes Szávay/Elena Vesnina, and Anna-Lena Grönefeld/Patty Schnyder also won. In mixed doubles second seeds Yan Zi/Mark Knowles were also shown the exit in the second round by Canadians Aleksandra Wozniak/Daniel Nestor, while 7th seeds Anabel Medina Garrigues/Tommy Robredo won their first round match.\nDay 9 (27 January).\nIn the first quarterfinal match of the day, women's 7th seed Vera Zvonareva was at her best, despite falling behind 3–1 in the first set as 16th seed Marion Bartoli seemed to have set up the decisive break. Zvonareva, who have yet to concede a set throughout the tournament, hit back strongly, moving her opponent around the court and hitting clean winners while errors started to flow from Bartoli's racket with alarming regularity as her game started to beak apart. In the end, it was Zvonareva who reeled off eleven straight games as she routed the Frenchwoman 6–3, 6–0, advancing to her maiden Grand Slam semifinal. 3rd seed Dinara Safina had a tough opponent in the form of Jelena Dokić, who had defeated three seeded players on her way to the quarterfinals and had won all her matches in three sets so far. The two players traded breaks regularly as they shared the first two sets, Safina taking the first 6–4 but losing the second by the same scoreline. Dokić, with strong local support behind her, continued to battle bravely, breaking Safina to level things at 4–4 in the decider but in the end, Safina's stamina and speed prevailed as she wrapped up the match 6–4, 4–6, 6–4, and progress to the semifinals, while Dokić exited the tournament, but can be assured of a return to the top 100 in the post-tournament rankings.\nIn the men's draw, Novak Djokovic's reign as the defending champion came to an abrupt end after he forfeited his match against Andy Roddick while 7–6(3), 4–6, 2–6, 1–2 down, due to heat stress. Djokovic had started shakily, winning a tiebreak after both players failed to force a break point on their opponent's serve, but some inspired play by Djokovic saw him taking the tiebreak. Roddick, however, was too strong on his own serve in the second set, dropping just two points and eventually taking the second set 6–4. Djokovic was clearly not himself from the beginning of the third set, and laboured for the final eleven games of the match battling cramps and heat stress before finally decided to give up after he was broken to love in the third game of the 4th set, handing Roddick a 4th semifinal appearance in Melbourne Park. Roddick will face a familiar foe in second seed Roger Federer next, after the Swiss recorded an astonishingly easy victory over Juan Martín del Potro, who is playing in just his second Grand Slam quarterfinal. After losing the first set 6–3, del Potro seemed to have given up while Federer only appeared more devastating as the match progressed, before recording a 6–3, 6–0, 6–0 victory, after which the Argentine admitted that there was little he could do against Federer if he was not playing well.\nThe women doubles semifinals lineup was also completed. 9th seeded Daniela Hantuchová and Ai Sugiyama reached the semifinals after ending the dreams of co-world number ones Cara Black and Liezel Huber in three sets, winning a third set tiebreak 12–10, and will be up against unseeded Nathalie Dechy and Mara Santangelo next, the French-Italian pairing coming from behind to send Spanish 11th seeds Nuria Llagostera Vives/María José Martínez Sánchez packing. The other semifinal match will be between French Open runners-up Casey Dellacqua/Francesca Schiavone against the Williams sisters, Venus and Serena, with the 12th seeded Australian-Italian pair coming back from a first set bagel to defeat Anna-Lena Grönefeld/Patty Schnyder while the 10th seeds needed 3 sets to get past Hsieh Su-wei/Peng Shuai as well. In men's doubles, giantkillers Łukasz Kubot/Oliver Marach defeated another seeded team, 6th seeds Mariusz Fyrstenberg/Marcin Matkowski and will play 3rd seeds Mahesh Bhupathi/Mark Knowles in the semifinals.\nIn mixed doubles, it was a bad day for Black and Huber as well as the top seeded Cara Black and Leander Paes crashed out to the unseeded pairing of Patty Schnyder/Wesley Moodie, while Liezel Huber and Jamie Murray lost to Nathalie Dechy/Andy Ram. 7th seeds Anabel Medina Garrigues/Tommy Robredo and unseeded Iveta Benešová/Lukáš Dlouhý made it to the quarterfinals, both with wins in a match tie-break against their respective opponents, leaving Medina Garrigues and Robredo as the only seeded team left.\nDay 10 (28 January).\nDay ten of the competition saw temperatures reaching as high as 43 degrees Celsius, causing the extreme heat policy (EHP) to be implemented for the first time this year. As part of the policy, all outdoor matches were suspended and eventually cancelled, affecting many junior matches, and also legends and wheelchair tournaments. Play continued in the main stadiums, with Svetlana Kuznetsova, apparently more comfortable than her opponent Serena Williams in the blistering heat, taking the first set 7–5 despite failing to close the set while serving at 5–4 up. However, the momentum swung over to Williams' side, after the match was interrupted for closing the roof of the stadium due to the implementation of the EHP. Kuznetsova, visibly unhappy at the interruption, hang in tough to break Williams again and went 5–3 up, but will rue missing a golden opportunity to make her first Australian Open semifinal as Williams won 4 games in a row to take the second set 7–5, and blasted her way through the third 6–1, winning ten out of the last eleven games to destroy the Russian's dream of an all-Russian semifinal, following Elena Dementieva's 15th win of the season. The 4th seeded Russian proved too good for surprise package Carla Suárez Navarro, playing in her second Grand Slam quarterfinal in just four Grand Slam main draw appearances, though the 6–2, 6–2 scoreline did not clearly reflect the closeness of the match, as the young Canary Island resident had numerous chances to break back against Dementieva, only to be saved by the in-form Russian each time.\nThe second semifinal match in the men's singles has also been decided when top seed Rafael Nadal set up an all-Spanish encounter with compatriot, 14th seed Fernando Verdasco. Nadal experienced momentum swings against 6th seeded Gilles Simon, winning the first set 6–2 with ease, but had to come from behind in the next two sets, including saving a set point in the second set, but eventually breaking Simon to win both sets 7–5, and continued his march to a first Australian Open crown after advancing to a second straight semifinals without dropping a set. Hopes of a rematch of last year's semifinals were dashed after Jo-Wilfried Tsonga was sent out of the tournament in four sets against a fired up Fernando Verdasco, who had been on song since winning the Davis Cup for Spain at the end of last year. Tsonga's serve appeared impenetrable early on, while Verdasco was forced to save break points but raced to a 5–2 lead in the tiebreaker before eventually winning 7–2. Tsonga hit back with his first break which sealed the second set, but Verdasco's serve once again proved to be the deciding factor as Tsonga's falter, Verdasco racing to a 4–0 lead in the third and converting all four break opportunities he has, in contrast to Tsonga's two out of thirteen, and powered into his maiden Grand Slam semifinals 7–6(2), 3–6, 6–3, 6–2.\nIn men's doubles, second seeds Bob and Mike Bryan advanced to the semifinals with a hard-fought win over compatriots Mardy Fish/John Isner, where they will take on 4th seeds Lukáš Dlouhý/Leander Paes in a rematch of last year's US Open final, who ended the journey of Italians Simone Bolelli/Andreas Seppi. The mixed doubles semifinals lineup is also completed with 7th seeds Anabel Medina Garrigues/Tommy Robredo defeating Patty Schnyder/Wesley Moodie in a match tie-break, and will play Nathalie Dechy/Andy Ram after the unseeded pair defeat Dominika Cibulková/Jürgen Melzer in straight sets. Last year's finalists Sania Mirza/Mahesh Bhupathi also won through against Aleksandra Wozniak/Daniel Nestor, and will play Czechs Iveta Benešová/Lukáš Dlouhý, who received a walkover from Alizé Cornet/Marcelo Melo.\nDay 11 (29 January).\nThe women's semifinals were played at Rod Laver Arena with the roof closed due to high temperatures, which eventually caused the Extreme Heat Policy to be invoked for the second day in a row with outdoor matches suspended until evening. Play continued inside with Serena Williams against Elena Dementieva, whom she had lost three matches against. The first two games saw multiple deuces and a couple of break points for both players but ultimately managed to hold serve, and the game proceeded on serve until Williams broke the deadlock in the eighth game and subsequently served out the first set 6–3. Dementieva bounced back strongly to break Williams at the early stages of the second set to open up a 3–0 lead, but her serve began to falter as well, recording a series of double faults as Williams broke back twice to lead 4–3. A series of blistering forehands saw Dementieva getting back into the match but in the end, her serve failed her again and Serena Williams soon served for the match, winning 6–3, 6–4 in 98 minutes, ending Dementieva's unbeaten start to the season and advancing to the women's final for the fourth time. Her opponent will be Dinara Safina, who broke a three-match losing streak as well against Vera Zvonareva. Zvonareva, in her first Grand Slam semifinals, appeared to be more shaky of the two, quickly falling behind against Safina's dictating baseline rallies. Even though Zvonareva managed to break back, she appeared to be troubled by her own serve, until Safina broke again in the 7th game and went on to seal the set 6–3. The second set was a closer affair as Safina began to make unforced errors, trading a break with Zvonareva, until Zvonareva appeared to have the upper hand while serving for the second set at 6–5. Safina, however, broke her opponent to love and from that point onwards she was in control, sealing her second Grand Slam final by winning the tiebreak. Victories for both Williams and Safina ensured that Jelena Janković will surrender her world number one status in the post-tournament rankings to the winner of the finals, and is projected to fall to number 3 in the world.\nIn the first men's semifinals, Roger Federer was back to his best as he dismantled American Andy Roddick 6–2, 7–5, 7–5 to move on to his fourth Australian Open final, having won the previous three in 2004, 2006 and 2007. Federer was in complete control in the first set, quickly breaking Roddick twice to open up a 5–1 lead, but had to stave off a late Roddick charge to secure the first set 6–2. The second set was much closer, Roddick relying on his big serves and constantly charging to the net to stay in the set, even though Federer looked comfortable and broke the American in the eleventh game, serving out with ease. The third set was similar to the second set, and as Federer sealed the decisive break to lead 6–5, there was no stopping the Swiss as he advanced to the finals, where he awaits the winner between Rafael Nadal and Fernando Verdasco.\nThe men's and women's doubles semifinals were also concluded, with Bob and Mike Bryan easing past Lukáš Dlouhý and Leander Paes 6–3, 6–3 in just 54 minutes, advancing to their fifth final in six years, while Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles needed just four more minutes to defeat surprise package Łukasz Kubot and Oliver Marach 6–3, 6–1. The women's doubles finals will be between 9th seeded Daniela Hantuchová/Ai Sugiyama and 10th seeded Venus Williams/Serena Williams. The Slovakian-Japanese pairing looked sharp on the way to a 6–4, 6–3 victory over Nathalie Dechy and Mara Santangelo, while the Williams sisters, with Serena fresh from her singles semifinals, crushing 12th seeds Casey Dellacqua/Francesca Schiavone 6–0, 6–2. Nathalie Dechy and Andy Ram were the first to advance to the mixed doubles final, sending the last seeded pair Anabel Medina Garrigues and Tommy Robredo out of the tournament with a 7–6(7), 6–4 win.\nDay 12 (30 January).\nIn the second men's singles semifinals, top seeded Rafael Nadal took on his countrymen, 14th seed Fernando Verdasco, in the first ever all-Spanish semifinal in Australian Open. Nadal was the favourite to advance, only losing one set to his older opponent in 6 meetings and is yet to drop a set this year in Melbourne Park, however Verdasco had been on his peak form, upsetting favourites like Andy Murray and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on his way to his maiden Grand Slam semifinal. With Roger Federer waiting in the final, both players carried their form into the match, holding on to their own serve as they entered a first set tiebreak, where Nadal had the initial advantage, but Verdasco's big serves comes to his rescue again and earned two set points after a lucky net cord, which he duly converted to take the first set. Nadal was heavily tested on his own serve in the second set while Verdasco powered to several love service games, but Nadal hung on and with some astonishing play, saved two game points in the 10th game and broke Verdasco, levelling things at one sets all. The momentum appeared to swing to Nadal's side as he broke Verdasco twice in the third set, only for Verdasco to break back immediately each time, bringing the third set into a tiebreaker which Nadal won handily. Verdasco's huge forehands and serve continued to pose a problem for Nadal, even though he had to call on a trainer at changeovers to tend to what appeared as a problem to his left calf. Another tiebreak was needed to settle the 4th set, and Verdasco sprinted away with a 7–1 victory, bringing the match to a decider. By then the match had already lasted more than 4 hours – but neither player showed signs of tiredness, even though Nadal appeared to be more at ease. Having come down from 0–30 down to lead 5–4 in the decider, Nadal gained 3 match points courtesy of only a 3rd double fault from Verdasco, and even though Verdasco managed to save two of them, a second double fault of the game – 4th overall – handed Nadal the match and a place in the finals. Nadal only managed to win one more point than Verdasco (193 to 192), who blasted 95 winners past Nadal, in a match that broke the Australian Open record as the longest men's singles match at 5 hours and 14 minutes (previous record by Boris Becker and Omar Camporese in 1991 at 5 hours and 11 minutes).\nIn an earlier match, the women's doubles final was played out between Daniela Hantuchová/Ai Sugiyama and Serena Williams/Venus Williams. Playing beneath the roof of the Rod Laver Arena as temperatures hit 43 degrees Celsius outdoors, the Slovak—Japanese pairing appeared to have the upper hand at first, breaking Venus to take the opening game. But it did not take the sisters too long to find their rhythm as Sugiyama was broken for 2–2. Sugiyama's serve was under pressure again by some heavy returns and the sisters break again, serving out the first set 6–3. All four players failed to hold serve at 1–1 in the second set, with Sugiyama's first to go, but eventually the Williamses get the decisive break to lead 4–3. Two games later, Hantuchová was left serving to stay in the match, but the sisters combined power proved too much, as they eased to a 6–3, 6–3 victory, for their 8th Grand Slam doubles title together, meaning they are now the joint 3rd most successful doubles pairings in the Open Era, together with Virginia Ruano Pascual and Paola Suárez, and behind Martina Navratilova/Pam Shriver (21) and Gigi Fernández/Natasha Zvereva (14).\nLast year's mixed doubles finalist, India's Sania Mirza and Mahesh Bhupathi also earned the opportunity for another shot at the title, cruising past Iveta Benešová/Lukáš Dlouhý 6–1, 6–4 to advance to the finals against Nathalie Dechy and Andy Ram.\nDay 13 (31 January).\nThe women's singles final saw second seed Serena Williams clash against third seed Dinara Safina, with the winner ascending to the top spot in the WTA rankings, replacing Jelena Janković, in the post-tournament rankings. Safina was also aiming to be just the second Russian to ascend to the position with her maiden Grand Slam title, while it would be the 10th for Williams. Having won the women's doubles title a day earlier, Williams settled down quickly, comfortably holding serve and built up a 2–0 lead following multiple double faults from Safina. A hope for a Safina comeback was quickly extinguished as Williams looked sharp, blasting winners and heavy returns past her younger opponent, and sealed the first set 6–0 in just 22 minutes. Safina regrouped and proceeded to break Williams in the opening game of the second set, her first lead of any kind in the match, but the advantage was short-lived as Williams broke back immediately, and after easily holding to love, two more double faults and errors from Safina allowed her opponent to seal the decisive break. Safina could do nothing more than fighting to hold her own serves, forcing Williams to serve out, but another dominant service game saw Williams clinched her 4th Australian Open title after wins in 2003, 2005 and 2007. Safina admitted later during the prize giving ceremony that she felt like a ball boy on court against her opponent, promising to return the following year, while Williams will spend her 62nd non-consecutive week on top of the rankings next week.\nFollowing the women's singles final, the men's doubles final took place in the Rod Laver Arena. Second seeds, American twins Bob and Mike Bryan overcame the third seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles to take home their third Australian Open title together. Bhupathi and Knowles came out firing first, playing a near flawless first set to take the first set 6–2 after just 27 minutes, with a series of clever play that wrong-footed the twins on various occasions. They continued to pressure the 30-year-old Americans in the second set, forcing numerous break points but unable to convert each time, as the momentum shifted over and with Knowles' serve starting to falter, the Bryans were able to put away some smashes and volleys to take the second set 7–5. From there, they looked comfortable, steamrolling past the decider 6–0 to regain the title they last won in 2007, and dash Bhupathi's hope of winning two titles (he made it to the finals of the mixed doubles as well).\nDay 14 (1 February).\nNadal and Federer's first encounter for the year resulted in a five-set epic—lasting 4 hours and 23 minutes—with Nadal prevailing, 7–5, 3–6, 7–6(3), 3–6, 6–2 for his sixth Grand Slam title and his first on hard courts. Nadal is the first Spaniard in history to win the Australian Open and the fourth male tennis player – after Jimmy Connors, Mats Wilander and Andre Agassi — to win Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces. Later in 2009, Roger Federer would become the fifth player to accomplish this feat upon winning his 14th grand slam title at the 2009 French Open.\nFederer, who was pursuing a record-tying fourteenth Grand Slam title, was unable to hold back tears during the trophy presentation.\nChampions.\nSeniors.\nMen's singles.\n Rafael Nadal defeated Roger Federer, 7–5, 3–6, 7–6(7–3), 3–6, 6–2\nWomen's singles.\n Serena Williams defeated Dinara Safina, 6–0, 6–3\nMen's doubles.\n Bob Bryan / Mike Bryan defeated Mahesh Bhupathi / Mark Knowles, 2–6, 7–5, 6–0\nWomen's doubles.\n Serena Williams / Venus Williams defeated Daniela Hantuchová / Ai Sugiyama, 6–3, 6–3\nMixed doubles.\n Sania Mirza / Mahesh Bhupathi defeated Nathalie Dechy / Andy Ram, 6–3, 6–1\nJuniors.\nBoys' singles.\n Yuki Bhambri defeated Alexandros Georgoudas, 6–3, 6–1\nGirls' singles.\n Ksenia Pervak defeated Laura Robson 6–3, 6–1\nBoys' doubles.\n Francis Casey Alcantara / Hsieh Cheng-peng defeated Mikhail Biryukov / Yasutaka Uchiyama, 6–4, 6–2\nGirls' doubles.\n Christina McHale / Ajla Tomljanović defeated Aleksandra Krunić / Sandra Zaniewska, 6–1, 2–6, [10–4]\nWheelchair events.\nWheelchair men's singles.\n Shingo Kunieda defeated Stéphane Houdet, 6–2, 6–4\nWheelchair women's singles.\n Esther Vergeer defeated Korie Homan, 6–4, 6–2\nWheelchair quad singles.\n Peter Norfolk defeated David Wagner, 7–6(7–5), 6–1\nWheelchair men's doubles.\n Robin Ammerlaan / Shingo Kunieda defeated Stefan Olsson / Maikel Scheffers, 7–5, 6–1\nWheelchair women's doubles.\n Korie Homan / Esther Vergeer defeated Agnieszka Bartczak / Katharina Krüger, 6–1, 6–0\nWheelchair quad doubles.\n Nick Taylor / David Wagner defeated Johan Andersson / Peter Norfolk, 6–2, 6–3\nSingles seeds.\nWithdrawals: Lindsay Davenport, Katarina Srebotnik, Nikolay Davydenko, Maria Sharapova, Li Na, Nicolas Kiefer \nExternal links.\n "

He is the younger brother of Lee Richardson who also played ice hockey at a professional level.\nRichardson began his career with his hometown team the Swindon Lynx. In 2003, Richardson moved to the Bracknell Bees in a two-year spell. Richardson's good performances during the 2004–05 season, which included nine goals and 18 assists for 27 points, saw him move to the Elite League for the Cardiff Devils.

In 2008, Richardson signed with the Basingstoke Bison. Shortly after the end of the 2008–09 season, with Basingstoke dropping out of the Elite League, Richardson re-signed for the Cardiff Devils as a defenceman.\nHe moved briefly to Kazakhstan to sign for Arlan Kokshetau before re-joining Cardiff in 2012. He remained with Cardiff until 2020 but left the Elite League side over ongoing uncertainty about whether the 2020-21 Elite League season would go ahead.\nOn 8 September 2020, Richardson moved abroad for a second time, signing a one-year deal with German DEL2 team EC Bad Nauheim. The expectation is Richardson will return to Cardiff in 2021.\nIn July 2021, the Cardiff Devils announced Richardson had signed terms for the 2021–22 season.

        "text": "Poplar Blackwall and District Rowing Club is a rowing club in Millwall, on the River Thames in England, on the northern bank of the Thames opposite Greenwich on the Isle of Dogs, London.\nClub history.\nPoplar Blackwall and District Rowing Club was founded in 1854 and is one of the oldest rowing clubs in Great Britain. It was established by a group of young lightermen as \"The Blackwall Rowing and Athletic Club\". Boats were carried to the river from a local pub.\nAfter World War I there was an increase in membership from shipwrights, boilermakers and stevedores from the nearby shipyards and docks, although the depression in the 1930s led to reduced activity again.\nThe club reformed with its present name in 1935 and established a club and boat house on the present site in 1937: \"the boys themselves constructed a launching ramp at Calder's Wharf\", using North Greenwich railway station as a shelter for the boats.\nIn 1964 the club became aware of Greenwich Council’s plans to buy the existing site at Calders Wharf, which up until that point had been privately leased to the club, and relocate them to the South side of the river. The then club president, Dorothea (Dolly) Woodward Fisher O.B.E. negotiated with the council to reach agreement that they fund construction of a new building themselves under the council’s proviso that a gymnasium be provided and the club, \"…should cater for the poor boys and men of Poplar, Blackwall, Stepney and surrounding Districts\".\nAn appeal was launched to raise £75,000 for construction. Club president Mrs Woodward Fisher, who also ran a prominent lighterage business together with her late husband W. J. Woodward-Fisher, in Limehouse, took the helm in securing funds, \"Mrs Fisher was wonderful and got all sorts of people on board. Ex Mayor of London Lord Rothchilds, Lord Cottesloe and many charities to help our cause.\"\nArchitects Forrest and Barber were commissioned to design the new club house, completed in 1970. The building has a strong modernist aesthetic, particularly visibly when seen from the South side of the river, characteristic of the architects’ previous projects which include the Harrison Gibson furniture showroom in Ilford, East London.\nActivities.\nThe club provides rowing and sculling for adult, adult beginner, junior, masters (mature categories). It has events for recreational and competitive sides of the sport.\nThe club house marks the finish of the annual Great River Race.\nTaking the period since 2000 alone, PBDRC has seen members win more than 10 regattas and winter head races. The club has, at the top level, produced and enhanced international oarsmen and oarswomen: a few members of the club have represented Great Britain in the Olympic Games and World Championships in this period.\nCompetition history.\nIn 1995 and 1996, juniors from the club (in a composite quad with the Windsor Boys' School) won the Fawley Challenge Cup at Henley Regatta.\nIn 2011, Ralph Humphrey and Robert Milligan's double won the World Masters in Poznan, Poland, the Britain Masters and the Henley Masters Veterans."

        "title": "Bowling Green Hot Rods",
        "text": "The Bowling Green Hot Rods are a Minor League Baseball team of the South Atlantic League and the High-A affiliate of the Tampa Bay Rays. They are located in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and play their home games at Bowling Green Ballpark, which opened in 2009. The team is named for the city's connections to the automotive and racing industries such as the National Corvette Museum, Holley Carburetor, Beech Bend Raceway, and the Bowling Green Assembly Plant.\nFounded in 2009, they were members of the Class A South Atlantic League in their inaugural season and played in the Class A Midwest League from 2010 to 2020. There were elevated to the High-A classification and placed in the High-A East in 2021, but this was renamed the South Atlantic League in 2022.\nHistory.\nThe Hot Rods began life as the Wilmington Waves, one of two South Atlantic League expansion teams for the 2001 season. However, the Waves' stay at Brooks Field in Wilmington, North Carolina, lasted but a single season. They became the South Georgia Waves when the team was moved to the Paul Eames Sports Complex in Albany, Georgia, for the 2002 season. The team retained the moniker name when it again moved to Golden Park in Columbus, Georgia, just before the 2003 campaign. One year later, in 2004, the franchise changed names and became the Columbus Catfish.\nIn April 2008, ownership moved the team to Bowling Green effective for the 2009 season under the new nickname \"Hot Rods.\" Their first manager as the Hot Rods was Matt Quatraro.\nIn 2010, the Hot Rods and the Lake County Captains moved from the South Atlantic League to the Midwest League, a plan meant to alleviate travel expenses associated with routine road trips as well as player movement within the teams' respective organizations.\nIn December 2013, Art Solomon, owner of the Hot Rods for five years, sold the team to Manhattan Capital Sports headed by Stuart Katzoff.\nThe Hot Rods have been widely recognized for their promotional efforts. In 2009, the team's \"What Could've Been Night\" was named Promotion of the Year by MiLB.com. In 2010, Hot Rods Assistant General Manager Greg Coleman was honored as Marketer of the Year by the Professional Marketing Association.\nIn September 2018, the team was sold to Jack Blackstock who had previously been a minority investor in the team.\nThat year, the Hot Rods won 90 games and captured their first ever Midwest League title, under then manager Craig Albernaz.\nAlong with Major League Baseball's reorganization of the minors after the 2020 season, the Hot Rods were invited to remain a Tampa Bay affiliate but be elevated to High-A in 2021 as members of the High-A East. They won the Southern Division title by ending the season with a first-place 82–36 record. They then won the High-A East championship by defeating the Greensboro Grasshoppers, 3–2, in a best-of-five series. Jeff Smith won the league's Manager of the Year Award. In 2022, the High-A East became known as the South Atlantic League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.\nBowling Green Ballpark.\nBowling Green Ballpark was designed by architectural firm DLR Group. The right-centerfield wall in Bowling Green Ballpark is unique in that it is concave in right-center because of the shape of a pre-existing road behind the field. The scoreboard in right-centerfield measures 35-feet tall and 56-feet wide, with the ability to show scoring, live video, advertisements, player statistics, and more. Embedded in the left field wall is a 6-foot, 3inch tall by 68-foot wide LED display board, behind which is a picnic area. There are two grass lawn seating areas- one in left-center and one at the right field line. The kids play area boasts an inflatable car customized with the Hot Rods' logo, a carousel, and a playground, and a behind the batter's eye in centerfield, a splash-pad. The Performance Food Service Club is a bar located on suite level directly behind home plate. Also on the suite level are 10 suites, the Hall of Fame suite, and a party deck—The Coca-Cola Deck.\nMedia coverage.\nIn addition to internet streaming coverage on MILB.tv, the Hot Rods are broadcast locally on radio station WKCT AM 930 and translator W281BV (104.1 FM) since 2022. WBGN was the original flagship station of Hot Rods baseball for the team's first 12 years in Bowling Green from 2009 to 2021.\nMascots.\nOne of the Hot Rods' mascots is an anthropomorphic bear named Axle. Debuting in 2009, he wears an orange Hot Rods uniform, number 00. The Hot Rods' furry, fun-loving bear has captivated crowds at Bowling Green Ballpark while making good on his promise to become a true community ambassador. Roscoe is the Hot Rods' second mascot, debuting during the 2010 season. He is a Grease Monkey who wears a navy Hot Rods jersey.\nTurbo is a Golden Retriever who was adopted into the Hot Rods family on December 13, 2019. He is currently training to become a \"batdog\", retrieving bats and balls and returning them to the Hot Rods' dugout, as well as delivering balls to the home plate umpire, for the 2021 season. Turbo is one of a few bat dogs in Minor League Baseball.\nAlumni.\nThe following are players in Major League Baseball who played, at one time, for the Hot Rods. Players are listed under the team they debuted for."

MacGregor currently produces a wide range of golf clubs, bags, and accessories.\nThe company roots can be traced to 1829, with the establishment of \"Dayton Last Company\", a maker of hand-carved wooden lasts for footwear. Adding partners in subsequent decades, current company was officially founded in 1897 as the \"Crawford, McGregor &amp; Canby Company\", becoming one of the first American manufacturers of golf clubs—items which also included heavy percentages of wooden components.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nMacGregor Golf dates its corporate origins to 1829, when Archibald and Ziba Crawford arrived in Dayton, Ohio, to begin the manufacture of hand-carved wooden footwear lasts for the manufacture of shoes. Their product was successful and they expanded the operation to include four or five hired workmen under the firm name Dayton Last Works, with a concentration on shoe lasts, which firm continued for a number of decades.\nThe firm was joined by John McGregor in 1874 and Edward Canby in 1886 so that by 1897 the company had taken the name \"Crawford, McGregor &amp; Canby\", with its base of operations remaining in Dayton, being officially constituted. Golf shafts of the early 20th century being made of wood rather than the metal, fiberglass, and other materials of today, in 1897 the company made the transition from footwear lasts to clubmaking, becoming one of the first American manufacturers of golf clubs.\nDuring the 1930s Crawford, McGregor &amp; Canby was acquired by the Goldsmith Company to form MacGregor-Goldsmith. The new owners found the name \"MacGregor\" to be stronger than \"Goldsmith\" in the marketplace and subsequently changed the name of the firm to MacGregor.\nOwnership changes.\nHaving previously been owned by the Wickes Corporation, and before that the Brunswick Corporation, Amer Sports acquired a majority 80% stake in MacGregor from Jack Nicklaus in the mid-1980s for a reported $8 million. With MacGregor's fortunes deteriorating, in 1997 Amer sold the company to a British-led consortium. The firm changed hands again the following August with its acquisition by equity investment company The Parkside Group.\nIn 2003, MacGregor regained control of MacGregor Golf Japan from Suntory, and in 2006, along with Greg Norman co-acquired the Greg Norman Collection brand of sports apparel from Adidas. In May 2009, MacGregor was acquired by Golfsmith International and Norman stepped down as chairman. Golfsmith owned the company until the retailer fell into bankruptcy in 2016. Golfsmith's assets, including MacGregor Golf, were later acquired by Dick's Sporting Goods.\nSponsorship deals.\nIn addition to its long association with Jack Nicklaus, MacGregor has had endorsement deals with many top professional golfers including José María Olazábal and Lee Janzen."

        "text": "Cobra Golf is a sports equipment manufacturing company based in Carlsbad, California, focused on golf equipment, producing a wide range of golf clubs. The company is currently a subsidiary of Puma.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nThe company was founded in 1973 by Thomas L. Crow, winner of the 1961 Australian amateur golf championship. He was inspired by the notion that golfers in the United States typically bought clubs at a whim, with the hopes that they may make their game better. Cobra produced one of the first utility clubs, the \"Baffler\" –introduced in 1980– long before the use of such clubs became popular. Cobra was dedicated to the average golfer, especially ladies and seniors which makes it understandable that is also the first U.S. club manufacturer to sell stock graphite-shafted woods and irons that are known for being lighter clubs. In five years, Cobra Golf was selling about $4.5 million worth of these clubs annually.\nIn 1994 King Cobra oversized irons became the best selling irons in golf, making Cobra synonymous with oversized irons. The company was acquired in 1996 by American Brands Inc. (later known as Fortune Brands) and was grouped together under the Acushnet Company umbrella. In 2010, Cobra was acquired by Puma SE.\nIn 1999 Cobra introduced Dista golf balls intended to maximize distance for all players with multiple swing speed models offered.  \"[In 2005] Cobra drivers rank No. 1 in Overall Driver Satisfaction Ratings in both 2003 and 2004, according to Darrell Survey U.S. Consumer Research, a leading independent golf consumer research company.\"\nMarketing.\nBetween 1989 and 1993, the company grew from $20 million to $56 million in annual sales thanks to aggressive marketing that included endorsements with leading players such as Hale Irwin, Beth Daniel and Greg Norman. Cobra's relationship with former world number one Norman lasted for many years. Other leading professionals to have had endorsement deals with Cobra include Rickie Fowler, Lexi Thompson, Gary Woodland, Justin Suh.\nIn February 2014, Cobra Golf signed a multi-year partnership with the PGA Tour's Honda Classic, making it one of the lead sponsors of the event. In 2016 Cobra Golf partnered with Flying Tee, a golf driving range and simulation venue, to provide the official equipment and apparel.\nProducts.\nCobra markets a full range of golf clubs including; drivers, fairways, hybrids, irons, wedges, utility irons, etc."

        "text": "Tom Wood (born 3 November 1986) is a former English rugby union player for Northampton Saints in the Aviva Premiership.\nWood plays as flanker but can also play at number eight.\nClub career.\nWood, who was educated at the Woodlands School and Sports College, Coventry, made his debut for Worcester Warriors against Bath in the opening round of the 2007–08 Guinness Premiership. Earlier in his career he spent some time in New Zealand and played for provincial team North Otago.\nWood was on the losing side in the final of the 2007–08 European Challenge Cup. In January 2010, Wood agreed to join the Northampton Saints.\nWood was awarded the 2011 Aviva Premiership Player of the Season award and was shortlisted by the Rugby Players' Association for their Players' Player of the Year award alongside Chris Ashton, Chris Budgen, Nick Evans, Eliota Fuimaono-Sapolu and Thomas Waldrom and for their Young Player of the Year award alongside Owen Farrell, Courtney Lawes, Joe Marler, Charlie Sharples and Manu Tuilagi.\nWood captained Saints to both the European Rugby Challenge Cup and Aviva Premiership trophies as the side completed its double winning season, collecting both titles within eight days of each other.\nNamed club captain for the 2016/17 season, Wood lead the side through a tough season which ended in Saints fighting to secure a final place in European Rugby Champions Cup for the 2017/18 season, despite beating Harlequins on the final day of the regular season. Despite their win, Saints had to continue their quest for top-tier European rugby and face Connacht Rugby in the European Champions Cup play-off semi-final. Beating Connacht convincingly, Saints turned their attentions to the play-off final and Stade Francais. Despite Wood receiving a red card in the proceedings, Saints went on to score a last minute try and secure the win and therefore the final place in the European Champions Cup for the following season.\nInternational career.\nIn January 2010, Wood made his debut for the England Saxons, against Ireland A.\nTom Wood made his debut for England against Wales in Cardiff in the opening game of the Six Nations, on 4 February 2011. He then played in the victories against Italy and France. Wood was named in the 30-man squad for England in the Rugby World Cup later that year, but started only one game against Georgia.\nUpon Stuart Lancaster's appointment as interim Head Coach, speculation mounted that Wood might be named captain for the 2012 Six Nations. However, a foot injury saw him miss both the Six Nations and England's tour to South Africa in the summer. Wood returned to the side in the end-of-year internationals, starting fixtures against South Africa and New Zealand. His performance in England's 38–21 victory over New Zealand saw him named Man of the Match.\nThe 2013 Six Nations saw Wood start at blindside flanker in the opening fixture against Scotland, but move to Number 8 for the remaining four fixtures following an injury to Ben Morgan. Wood was named captain for England's tour of Argentina in the summer, leading the side to a 2–0 series victory whilst playing in his usual position at blindside flanker. Wood was named to start for all three games in the following end-of-year internationals.\nThe flanker played for England during the 2015 Rugby World Cup as the side dropped out of their home World Cup in the pool stages.\nWood missed out on an England selection in the coming years but was re-called to the squad under Eddie Jones and helped the nation to end their losing streak against the Springboks in 2016 as well as hold onto their Six Nations title the following year while earning his 50th international cap.\nPlaying style.\nWood is capable of playing across all three back row positions, but is typically used at blindside flanker for his country. His abrasive style of play sees him featuring heavily in defence, frequently putting in high tackle counts and helping slow opposition ball at breakdowns. His height and athleticism also sees him used frequently as a lineout jumper.\nRetirement.\nWood announced his retirement from professional rugby in June 2022."

He won five caps for Wales and was selected for the British Lions 1910 tour of South Africa, though he did not play in any of the test games.\nRugby career.\nPlummer first played for Newport in 1905 at the age of 17 and spent almost the entirety of his career with the club. He captained Newport during the 1920/21 season and was part of the team that faced three touring sides; the 1906 and 1912 South Africans and the 1910 Australians.\nPlummer was first capped for Wales on 3 February 1912 when he played against Scotland at St Helens under the captaincy of Dicky Owen. It was an excellent game from a Welsh viewpoint as the team beat Scotland 21-6, and Plummer himself scored a try. During the same campaign he scored a second international try, this time against France at Rodney Parade. Plummer was later selected against the touring South African team, as he done so for Newport two months earlier.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

With no Queensland Rugby Union competition in place at that time the New South Wales Waratahs were the top Australian representative rugby union side of the period and a number of Waratah matches of the 1920s played against full international opponents were in 1986 decreed by the Australian Rugby Union as Test matches.\nIn 1921 he represented for New South Wales against the visiting Springboks and was selected to tour New Zealand. He played in seven matches on tour including the Waratah's Test victory.\nHe made representative appearances in 1922 against the New Zealand Maori and the All Blacks, played in three Tests against them in 1924 and in five matches against them in 1925. The 3rd test of 1925 played on 23 June at the Sydney Showground was Fox's sole appearance as the national captain. He was solid in further Test appearances against New Zealand in 1926.\nHe was a tremendous lineout forward and one of the senior players for the 1927–28 Waratahs tour of Britain, France and Canada, picked as the tour's vice-captain under Johnnie Wallace. He played in ten of the first thirteen games of the trip until he suffered a severe leg injury in the tour match loss to Oxford University RFC. He was captain in that Oxford game and with no substitutes allowed, the Waratahs played the second half with 14 men and lost to the students 0–3. He recovered for the last four matches including the international against France where Fox at least enjoyed a Test match victory.\nHe retired at the end of Waratahs tour.\nReferences.\n "

        "text": "David Brown (June 9, 1895 – disappeared April 27, 1925) was an American left-handed pitcher in Negro league baseball. Considered one of the better pitchers in Negro league history, he was also known for serious off-the-field problems. His career came to a premature end when he became a fugitive after allegedly killing a man in 1925.\nEarly career.\nBrown was born in Leon County, Texas. He had a good curveball and excellent control. He was also a good fielder and had outstanding speed, but was a weak hitter. Brown played with the Dallas Black Giants in 1917 and 1918. He was regarded as a \"timid nice guy\" who did not cause trouble, but during his time with the Dallas Black Giants he was involved in a highway robbery. Although Brown was reported to have become a fugitive, Rube Foster agreed to pay $20,000 for Brown's parole and he became a member of Foster's Chicago American Giants. However, this story may have been placed by Foster after Brown jumped to the Eastern Colored League, and conflated certain activities of Dave's older brother, Webster, with Dave to smear his reputation.\nChicago American Giants Seasons.\nBrown became the ace of the American Giants as they dominated negro league baseball in the early 1920s. From 1920 through 1922, he posted a 29–8 record in league games. His 11–3 record led them to a pennant win in 1921 including three victories in a playoff with the Bacharach Giants. His 8–3 record contributed to another pennant in 1922. In the winter following the 1922 season, Brown joined Oscar Charleston for the first season of the Cuban League's Santa Clara Leopardos.\nLeague change and abrupt career end.\nFor the 1923 season, Brown left Rube Foster's American Giants for the brand new Eastern Colored League. Foster voiced his displeasure, pointing out that Brown had been paroled to him and that he had promised Brown's mother to take care of him. He pointed out that the public would vilify him if he revoked. Brown posted a losing record in his first season with the New York Lincoln Giants but he and Charleston returned to Cuba the following winter and helped Santa Clara compile one of the best records in Cuban baseball history. His second season with the Lincoln Giants improved on the first and he defeated \"Cannonball\" Dick Redding and the Brooklyn Royal Giants to win the New York City championship.\nBrown's career came to an abrupt end in 1925. He went to a bar on the night of April 27, 1925 with Frank Wickware and Oliver Marcelle. Marcelle was a third baseman with a reputation for trouble off the field. The story at the time was that a fight erupted at the bar, possibly involving cocaine, and Brown killed one of the participants, Benjamin Adair. Wickware and Marcelle were questioned the next day at the ballpark, but Brown had disappeared. Later research indicates that he may have only been a witness, not the perpetrator. \nRumors and legacy.\nThe FBI searched for Brown, but he was never officially seen again. Rumors abounded that he continued playing baseball under the alias \"Lefty Wilson\" with semi-professional teams through the Midwestern United States. Lefty Wilson toured with Gilkerson's Union Giants in 1926, a white team in Bertha, Minnesota in 1927 and 1928, and he was rumored to have played in Sioux City, Iowa in 1929 and Little Falls, Minnesota in 1930. More unsubstantiated rumors claimed that Brown died in mysterious circumstances in Denver, Colorado in 1930. However, Lefty Wilson shows up again pitching for the Gilkerson's Union Giants again in 1932. Reportedly, he was alive in 1938. After extensive research, including contact with his descendants, his SABR biographer confirmed that he lived out his life quietly on the West Coast under the name Alfred Brown, dying in 1985 in Los Angeles.\nIn 1927, a \"Pittsburgh Courier\" column solicited opinions for the best black baseball player of all time. On April 2, John Henry Lloyd announced his list which included Dave Brown. When the \"Pittsburgh Courier\" announced a similar list in 1952, they included Brown on their second team.\nAssuming that the Negro Leagues are considered to be major leagues, Brown has the highest Adjusted ERA+ for a starting pitcher in major league history (169), and the second highest pitcher's winning percentage after Al Spalding (.738, 62–22).\nExternal links.\n and Baseball-Reference Black Baseball stats and Seamheads"

        "text": "Between July 1947 and March 1948 the Australia national rugby union team – the Wallabies – conducted a world tour encompassing Ceylon, Britain, Ireland, France and the United States on which they played five Tests and thirty-six minor tour matches. It was the first such tour in twenty years, since that of the 1927–28 Waratahs, as the 1939–40 Australia rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland tour had been thwarted by World War II. They were known as the Third Wallabies.\nThe 1947–48 side was notable in preserving their try-line uncrossed by any of the Home Nations in the first four Tests played. The nine-month journey was one of the last of that era of epic tours when transport was mostly by ship and when the tourists were whole-heartedly welcomed by rugby fans and townships, civic officials and royalty.\nThe Australians in those days were still showcasing the new running style of rugby that had not yet been fully embraced in the northern hemisphere. The legacy of Johnnie Wallace's leadership of 1927–28, of Cyril Towers and the credo of galloping rugby as played at his Randwick club in Sydney had some bearing on this but Batchelor also suggests that the everyday competition for public attention between the two rugby codes caused the Australian game (both in Sydney and Brisbane) to need to match the speed and open play of the 13-a-side code. This need was not the same in London and Cardiff where rugby league as yet posed no threat to spectator numbers coming through rugby union turnstiles.\nThe squad's leadership.\nA squad of thirty players was selected under tour captain Bill McLean. McLean was an experienced Wallaby and leader. His father and brother had represented as both Wallabies and Kangaroos, with his other brother Jack also a Wallaby tourist. Bill McLean had been selected in the 1939 side who'd travelled to England under captain Vay Wilson and were promptly turned about upon the declaration of war without playing a match. He had seen action in World War II against the Japanese as a Captain in an AIF Commando unit in Borneo. He had captained Australia's first post-war Wallaby sides on four occasions against the All Blacks and his return to the British Isles was in some ways a completion of unfinished business.\nTrevor Allan was only 20 when selected as vice-captain of the squad. He had impressed in his first state and national representative starts a year earlier but in a squad of veteran campaigners including Graham Cooke and Phil Hardcastle his vice-captaincy was a surprise and an indication that he was being groomed for the future.\nThe tour was only six matches old when Bill McLean fulfilled his dream of playing at Twickenham in a minor clash against Combined Services. The match was near completion when McLean was hit by three tacklers from different angles. Howell, Tressider and Shehadie all write that the snap of bone breaking was audible to onlookers. McLean suffered a serious spiral fracture of the tibia and fibula and had played his last representative match. The tour captaincy passed at that moment to Allan, now just a few days past his 21st birthday. Allan was leading a squad comprising war veterans in Ken Kearney, Col Windon, Eddie Broad and Neville Emery; three qualified medical practitioners in Phil Hardcastle, Doug Keller and Clem Windsor; and a mixture of new and experienced Wallabies.\nThe tradition on earlier Australian tours had been that the manager took care of arrangements and the Asst-Manager fulfilled the coaching duties. Shehadie reports that Arnold Tancred and McLean coached and trained the 1947–48 side with vigour while Jeff Noseda took care of tour administration. Journalist Phil Tressider accompanied the touring party and wrote of Tancred \"I remember Tancred as a grim, brooding man who not only managed the team but coached it and was sole selector. He would brook no interference and he kept the press at arm's length. He was fortified by his experiences as a player with the 1927–28 Waratahs and he had an aching ambition for victory\", Shehadie wrote of Tancred. \" \"[He] was a very strict disciplinarian who was determined that we would win as many matches as possible. He would constantly remind us that we would only be remembered for the number of matches we won\"\" and goes on to quote Jack Pollard: \"\"The only criticism of Tancred was that relied perhaps too heavily on the team's proven stars and did not give newcomers many opportunities. He barred sportswriters travelling with the team from staying in the same hotel, was uncooperative with the press, and the team did not enjoy very sympathetic media coverage\".\"'\nTour itinerary.\nThe squad sailed southwards from Sydney Harbour in July 1947 aboard the passenger liner \"Orion\". They departed Australia from Fremantle after crossing the Great Australian Bight, next docking in Colombo, Ceylon where they were welcomed and entertained by the expatriate community like the 1927–28 Waratahs before them. From there they sailed to Aden in Yemen, then Port Said, Egypt before arriving in England in the port town of Tilbury.\nAfter seeing the sights of a London still scarred from wartime devastation, the party left by train for Penzance in Cornwall where their on-land training would pick up ahead of the first tour match against Combined Cornwall and Devon at Camborne won by the Wallabies. The minor matches would have an exacting toll with firstly McLean's injury in the sixth game and then the loss of champion Manly winger Charlie Eastes in the match against Newport to a broken arm which also spelled the end of his tour participation.\nRugged matches in Cardiff and Llanelly followed before the Wallabies returned to London where they visited the House of Commons and the House of Lords and met Clement Attlee at 10 Downing St. Later at St James's Palace they were received by the Duke of Gloucester, a former Governor-General of Australia and met his young son Prince William. A tour highlight was a royal reception at Buckingham Palace where the squad met the King and Queen and the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. When the squad travelled to Ireland for the second Test they met the President Éamon de Valera.\nBack in Britain after the France Test, the Wallabies met the British Barbarians in their inaugural match against an international team – such fixtures would thereafter become a regular event against touring national southern-hemisphere sides. The fixture was arranged during the tour as an extra match to raise funds for the Australians' journey home via Canada. The Barbarians fielded six internationals from England, five from Wales, two from Scotland, one from Ireland. A Barbarian tradition is to select one uncapped player and on this occasion it was Blackheath F.C. winger Martin Turner. The Barbarians won 9–6 and at the after match function tour captain McLean was given honorary Barbarian membership.\nAfter the Barbarians match the team sailed for New York aboard the \"Queen Mary\". From there they travelled across the Rockies by train, playing a number of fixtures against sides comprising expatriates and American footballers. The final tour match was against a University of California team in Los Angeles. The homeward legs were taken by air – Australian National Airlines flew a Skymaster from Los Angeles to Hawaii (an overnight stop), to Canton Island, to Fiji (another overnight) before arriving in Sydney on 28 March 1948. Two years later that very same plane – the \"Amana\" – would crash on a scheduled flight from Melbourne to Perth killing all 29 on board.\nTest matches.\nAustralia were beaten squarely in a dull, forwards based game with neither side penetrating to score a try.\nThe Wallabies enjoyed a feast of possession in the first half with their locks Cooke and Kraefft dominating the line-outs and their forwards ahead in the scrums three to one. The match was played at a furious pace and at the twenty-minute mark suddenly for the first time in four Tests the Australian goal line was threatened when the English centre Bennett put Swarbrick into open space.\n\"Swarbrick licked up the pass like a sprinter head down for the finish. Sheer pace carried him on. Tonkin could not get to him. He swerved out, his flying feet not brushing the chalk from the touch line. Piper's dash to the corner was too late. Swarbrick pounced forward – he was clear ! The 70,000 crowd were on their toes. Wild arms waved to high heaven. The Twickenham Valley, pinched between the canyon grandstands, reverberated with thundering clanging to a crescendo. He was not only clear – he was through ! He was indeed over the line, safely, marvellously home. He had but to fall on his face and England would be a try up. A dead man must have scored us three points. And then, as Swarbrick hurled himself down, a pin-pointed rocket caught him, swept him through mid-air, ball and all, into the no-man's land of touch in goal. It was Trevor Allan, the forlorn hope, saving his side after all was lost. \"'\nThe sides were evenly matched thereafter with both sets of backs depriving the other of a scoring opportunity. Then right before half-time a kick by Newman failed to find touch and landed in the Australian pack for Ken Kearney to bring the ball forward. It went through many hands before Colin Windon scored in the corner to give the Wallabies a 3–0 lead at the break.\nWith the game three-quarters over England's full-back Syd Newman hit the post with a penalty attempt that would have kept them in the match. Then with ten minutes to go, the game opened up in Australia's favour. Alan Walker chip-kicked ahead, regathered in spectacular fashion and scored. Then Col Windon's punishing defence on English pivot Tommy Kemp saw Kemp spill the ball and Windon set off like \"the Breeze\" he was affectionately known as, and outpaced all to the try-line.\nMatches of the tour.\nThe \"Exhibition Matches\" are not classed as important as the \"Tour matches\", they are listed on the tour although the starting line-ups are not counted in the players stats.\nReferences.\n "

        "text": "The PGA Championship is an annual golf competition formerly held in mid-August until 2019, when it moved to mid-May. It was established in 1916 and is one of the four major championships played each year which include the Masters, the U.S. Open, and the Open Championship (British Open). In addition, this championship is conducted by the Professional Golfers' Association of America (PGA). Due to World War I and II, the competition was not held from 1917 to 1918 and in 1943, respectively.\nThe reigning champion of the competition is automatically invited to play in the other three majors for the next five years, and is exempt from qualifying for the PGA Championship for life. The champion also receives membership on the PGA Tour for the following five years and invitations to The Players Championship for five years. The prize of the tournament is the Wanamaker Trophy, which the champion keeps until the following year's competition. The PGA Championship was originally a match play event; however, in 1958 it was changed to a stroke play event.\nWalter Hagen (match play) and Jack Nicklaus (stroke play) hold the record for the most victories; both men have won the competition five times. Hagen holds the record for most consecutive wins in match play with four (1924–27), and Tiger Woods holds the record for most consecutive wins in stroke play with two, which he did twice (1999–2000, 2006–07). Phil Mickelson is the oldest winner of the PGA Championship; he was 50 years, 11 months old when he won in 2021. The youngest winner of the PGA Championship is Gene Sarazen, who was 20 years, 174 days old when he won in 1922. David Toms holds the record for the lowest score over 72 holes, which is 265.\nJason Day holds the record for most strokes under par for 72 holes, 20, when he won the 2015 PGA Championship. This is the record under par score in all major championships. The PGA Championship has had three wire-to-wire champions: Bobby Nichols in 1964, Raymond Floyd in 1982, and Hal Sutton in 1983. Four others have led wire-to-wire if ties after a round are counted: Floyd in 1969, Nick Price in 1994, Woods in 2000 and Mickelson in 2005.\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

        "title": "Roger Craig (baseball)",
        "text": "Roger Lee Craig (February 17, 1930 – June 4, 2023) was an American pitcher, coach and manager in Major League Baseball (MLB). After playing for the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets, St. Louis Cardinals, Cincinnati Reds and Philadelphia Phillies between and , Craig became an acclaimed pitching coach, and a manager, between and . \nAs a player and coach, Craig was part of four World Series championship teams. As a manager, he led the 1989 San Francisco Giants to the team's first National League championship in 27 years.\nPlaying career.\nCraig was born in Durham, North Carolina, and graduated from Durham High School, where he played multiple sports. He began his college sports career at North Carolina State University on a basketball scholarship, but spent only one year at NC State before signing a professional baseball contract with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1950 for $6,000 ().\nCraig threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . After his first two seasons in the Dodger farm system, he missed 1952 and 1953 while performing Korean War military service. In 1955, he won ten of 12 decisions for the Triple-A Montreal Royals, then was called up to the majors in midyear. In his debut game July 17, Craig was the Dodgers' starting pitcher against the Cincinnati Redlegs at Ebbets Field. He threw a complete game victory and allowed only three hits and one earned run as Brooklyn triumphed, 6–2. He made nine more starts for the Dodgers over the next ten weeks, and relieved in a dozen games more; he threw two more complete games, earned two saves, and posted a fine 2.78 earned run average as the Dodgers won the National League pennant. He started Game 5 of the 1955 World Series against the New York Yankees, worked six innings, gave up four hits and only two runs before being relieved by Clem Labine, and was credited with Brooklyn's 5–3 victory. Two days later, on October 4, 1955, Craig's teammate Johnny Podres shut out the Yanks in Game 7, giving Brooklyn its first and only World Series championship.\nCraig would appear in three more World Series. He was treated harshly by the Yankees and Chicago White Sox in the 1956 and 1959 World Series, losing two decisions with a dismal 9.98 earned run average; but he was almost flawless as a reliever for the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1964 Series. In two appearances for the Redbirds, he kept the Yankees scoreless and allowed only two hits in five innings pitched. A yeoman effort in Game 4, in which Craig worked scoreless innings pitched (with eight strikeouts) in relief of Ray Sadecki, enabled the Cardinals to recover from a 3–0 deficit to win, 4–3, with Craig getting credit for the victory. St. Louis went on to take the series in seven games.\nCraig was a member of the inaugural 1962 New York Mets. As a member of the starting rotation of the 1962 and Mets, who lost 120 and 111 games, respectively, Craig posted a 15–46 won–lost record during his two seasons with the expansion team. \"But,\" Craig once recalled, \"11 of those times it took a shutout to beat me.\" Despite his poor record, Craig was a stalwart of the legendarily bad team's pitching staff. Remarkably, he threw 27 complete games in 64 starts, demonstrating that he was one of the Mets' best pitchers. His manager, Casey Stengel, told him, \"You've gotta be good to lose that many.\"\nCraig lost the first game in Mets' history, 11–4, in St. Louis. (It has been erroneously believed that he gave up the Mets' first run on a balk; although he did commit a balk in the first inning, he already trailed 1–0, and the balk was not a scoring play.) Then, in 1963, from May 4 through August 4, Craig suffered through a personal 18-game losing streak. During it, he changed his uniform number from his traditional 38 to \"unlucky\" 13 in an attempt to break the 90-day winless stretch. Craig finally ended the drought with a complete game, 7–3 win over the Chicago Cubs at the Polo Grounds on August 9—a game the Mets won in the ninth inning on a walk-off grand-slam home run by Jim Hickman. The victory improved Craig's record to 3–20.\nA master of the split-finger fastball, Craig worked in 368 games over the course of his 12-year MLB career. He won ten or more games in , , and 1962, and posted a 74–98 won–lost mark (59–52 not counting his Mets' tenure). In career innings pitched, he surrendered 1,528 hits and 522 bases on balls, with 803 strikeouts and a 3.83 earned run average. He threw seven shutouts and 58 complete games, and earned 19 saves. His late MLB tenure consisted of one-year stops with the Cardinals (), Cincinnati Reds (), and Philadelphia Phillies (). Although he performed poorly during the 1959 World Series, Craig helped pitch the 1959 Los Angeles Dodgers to the National League pennant, winning 11 games (with complete-game victories in his last three starts), posting a brilliant 2.06 ERA, and leading his league in shutouts (four), despite making only 17 starts and spending part of the season with the Triple-A Spokane Indians. Overall he appeared in four World Series; in seven games and innings pitched, he allowed 19 earned runs on 31 hits and 16 bases on balls, and struck out 25. He split four World Series decisions and compiled a 6.49 ERA.\nCoach and manager.\nCraig retired from the mound after the 1966 campaign and rejoined the Dodgers as a scout (1967) and manager of Double-A Albuquerque (1968). In , former Dodger general manager Buzzie Bavasi appointed Craig the first pitching coach in the history of the newly born San Diego Padres. Enduring the growing pains of another expansion team, Craig spent four years as the Padres' mound tutor before he was replaced by ex-teammate Johnny Podres. After another brief return to the Dodgers as a minor league pitching instructor in 1973, Craig resumed his MLB coaching career with the Houston Astros (–) and had a second tour with the Padres (–). During the latter year, the Padres lost 93 games under two managers, John McNamara and Alvin Dark.\nIn March 1978—in the midst of spring training, and only two weeks before Opening Day—the Padres' ownership fired Dark for \"miscommunication\" with his players and elevated Craig to the manager's post. Said Craig at the time: \"It was the shock of my life, but the best shock I've ever had. My main task now is to get the players to relax so they can perform to the best of their capabilities.\" The 1978 Padres responded to Craig's leadership, improving by 15 games over 1977 and posting the first winning season (84–78) in franchise history. However, Craig's 1979 team took a giant step backward, reverting to a poor 68–93 record. Craig was fired at season's end and replaced by Jerry Coleman, the former Yankee second baseman then serving as the radio voice of the Padres.\nThe firing eventually proved to be beneficial to Craig's managing career, however. Sparky Anderson, a former Dodger minor leaguer and coaching colleague of Craig's on the 1969 Padres, had taken over as pilot of the Detroit Tigers in the middle of . He appointed Craig his pitching coach for , and over the next five seasons, Craig moulded the Detroit pitching staff (led by bellwethers Jack Morris and Dan Petry) into a formidable group. The 1984 Tigers stormed to a 35–5 start, the American League pennant, and World Series championship (achieved against the San Diego Padres). \nThe national exposure Craig received burnished his reputation as one of baseball's top pitching coaches and \"guru of the split-finger fastball\". Said former MLB catcher and manager Mike Scioscia in 2011, “Everyone was throwing that pitch. It was the pitch of the ’80s just like the pitch of the ’60s was a slider.”\nBut when the Detroit front office refused his request for a salary increase for 1985, Craig retired to his San Diego County ranch. His retirement did not last a full baseball season.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nFrom September 18, 1985, through the end of 1992, Craig was the manager of the San Francisco Giants. He replaced Jim Davenport for the final 18 games of the 1985 season, posting a 6–12 record. But in his first five full seasons with the Giants, 1986 through 1990, they never finished with a losing record.\nIn 1987, Craig's Giants belted 205 home runs, second-most in the major leagues, and won 90 games and the National League Western Division title, to make their first appearance in the postseason since . The Giants' divisional title in 1987 came just two years after they lost 100 games. The club came within one game of going to the World Series that year, losing to the Cardinals in seven games. Reportedly, Craig assigned players to watch the third base coach, a runner on base, and the man at the plate for each game, with the pitcher being told to do pick off attempts to help with studying what was seen. Along the way, Craig brought new popularity to the old baseball term \"Humm Baby\" — traditional bench and infield chatter that urges pitchers to put extra \"mustard\" on their fastballs. Brad Gulden, the third-string catcher behind Bob Brenly and Bob Melvin on the 1986 team, was the original “Humm Baby”. The moniker was bestowed on Gulden by Craig, and in the late 1980s the term spread until it applied to the entire team.\nIn 1989, Craig's Giants won their first National League pennant since 1962. Led by sluggers Kevin Mitchell and Will Clark and starting pitcher Rick Reuschel, they won 92 regular-season games (their most since ) and took the NL West title by three games over the Padres. Then they defeated the Cubs in five games in the 1989 National League Championship Series. But Craig's Giants were swept in four games by the Oakland Athletics in the World Series. That Series, the first ever between San Francisco Bay Area teams, was marred by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, which struck October 17, minutes before Game 3, scheduled for Candlestick Park. The quake killed 63 people and caused over 3,750 casualties. It delayed the World Series for ten days.\nThe Giants then began a slow decline on the field, winning 85 games in , 75 in , and 72 in . Owner Bob Lurie put the team on the market, and when he reached a tentative sales agreement with Florida businessman Vince Naimoli, the club was poised to relocate to Tampa–St. Petersburg for . But, in an eventful offseason, the National League rejected the Lurie-Naimoli deal; it instead approved the Giants' sale to a San Francisco group, headed by Peter Magowan, committed to keeping the club in the Bay Area. The new owners dismissed Craig on December 2. He finished with a career managerial record of 738 wins and 737 losses, 586–566 (.509) with the Giants. Then Magowan's group signed superstar free agent Barry Bonds on December 8. With Bonds anchoring his lineup, Craig's successor, Dusty Baker, won 103 games in 1993 and was named National League Manager of the Year.\nDeath.\nCraig died in San Diego on June 4, 2023, at the age of 93.\nExternal links.\n "

        "title": "List of formations in American football",
        "text": "The following is a list of common and historically significant formations in American football. In football, the formation describes how the players in a team are positioned on the field. Many variations are possible on both sides of the ball, depending on the strategy being employed. On offense, the formation must include at least seven players on the line of scrimmage, including a center to start the play by snapping the ball. \nThere are no restrictions on the arrangement of defensive players, and, as such, the number of defensive players on the line of scrimmage varies by formation.\nOffensive formations.\nThis list is not exhaustive; there are hundreds of different ways to organize a team's players while still remaining within the \"7 on the line 4 in the backfield\" convention. Still, this list of formations covers enough of the basics that almost every formation can be considered a variant of the ones listed below.\nT formation.\nThe T formation is the precursor to most modern formations in that it places the quarterback directly under center (in contrast to its main competitor of its day, the single wing, which had the quarterback receiving the ball on the fly).\nIt consists of three running backs lined up abreast about five yards behind the quarterback, forming the shape of a T. It may feature two tight ends (known as the Power T) or one tight end and a wide receiver (in this case known as a split end). When legendary coach George Halas' Chicago Bears used the T-formation to defeat the Washington Redskins by a score of 73–0 in the 1940 NFL championship game, it marked the end of the single wing at nearly all levels of play, as teams, over the course of the 1940s, moved to formations with the quarterback \"under center\" like the T. George Halas is credited with perfecting the T formation.\nOne variation of the T Formation would be where all the running backs would be closer than usual, being at fullback depth rather than halfback depth. Another variation of the \"balanced T\" formation is the so-called \"unbalanced T\" formation. In this configuration the line of scrimmage has an end and tackle left of center, while to the right of the center are two guards, a tackle, and an end. This creates a line that is weighted toward the right of the center. With the backfield lining up in the conventional T formation behind the center (quarterback, two halfbacks and fullback), the resulting configuration is \"unbalanced\" due to the asymmetry of the placement of the linemen. The \"split T\" spreads the offensive line out over almost twice as much ground compared to the conventional T formation. This causes the defensive line to also spread out, creating gaps the offense can exploit.\nI formation.\nThis was once one of the most common formations used at all levels of football, though it has been superseded over the past decade or so by formations that put the quarterback in the shotgun formation. \"The I\" consists of two backs lined up behind the quarterback, with the back closest to the quarterback being called the fullback and the back behind the fullback called the running back, tailback, or I-back. The two backs line up either in a line (hence the name of the formation since it looks like a letter \"I\") or with the fullback \"offset\" to either side. The fourth back is most commonly employed as an extra wide receiver. Here are three diagrams of I-Formation, strong side right (that is, with the tight end lining up to the right, typical for a right-handed quarterback). Notice that the 4th back required by the rules is the set-back wide receiver at the right (called the flanker).\nTwo other I formation variations include the Maryland I and the Power I. These formations lack a flanker, and use the maximum 3 running backs rather than the standard 2. They are used primarily as running formations, often in goal line situations. These may employ either tight ends or split ends (wide receivers) or one of each. The Maryland I was developed by Maryland head coach Tom Nugent. More recently, Utah has utilized this formation with quarterback Brian Johnson.\nSingle set back.\nAlso known as the \"ace\" or \"singleback\" formation, the single set back formation consists of one running back lined up about five yards behind the quarterback. The basic singleback set does not employ a fullback. The other players that are not on the line of scrimmage can either act as tight ends or wide receivers. This formation is normally used for a pass play, but can also be good for running, as defenders must move at least one player out of the middle of the field (the \"box\", between the tackles on the offensive line) to cover the additional wide receiver or tight end. Since an extra wide receiver is lined up in the space between the tackle or tight end and the outside wide receiver, he is called the slot receiver.\nA variation of the ace is known as the spread formation. It utilizes four wide receivers and no tight ends. In the NFL, this formation was the basis of the run and shoot offense that was popular in the 1980s with teams such as the Detroit Lions and the Houston Oilers but has since fallen out of favor as a primary offensive philosophy.\nIt is often used as a pass formation, because of the extra wide receivers. It also makes an effective run formation, because it \"spreads the field\" and forces the defense to respect the pass, thus taking players out of the box. Certain college programs, such as the University of Hawaii and Texas Tech still use it as their primary formation. Brigham Young University also uses the spread offense, although they tend to employ their tight ends more frequently than Hawaii and Texas Tech. Minnesota and TCU are also starting to employ the spread offense.\nJoe Gibbs, twice head coach of the Washington Redskins, devised an ace variation that used a setback, or \"flexed\" tight end known as an H-back. In this formation, the normal tight-end is almost exclusively a blocker, while the H-back is primarily a pass receiver. This formation is often referred to as a \"two tight end\" set. Some teams (like the Indianapolis Colts under Tony Dungy) use this formation with both tight ends on the line and use two flankers. Many other teams in the NFL, even those that do not use this as a primary formation, still run some plays using a variant of this formation.\nPro set.\nAlso called the \"split backs\" or \"three-end formation\", this is similar to the I-formation and has the same variations. The difference is that the two backs are split behind the quarterback instead of being lined up behind him.\nClark Shaughnessy designed the formation from the T Formation in 1949 after acquiring halfback Elroy \"Crazy Legs\" Hirsch. Shaughnessy thought he would make a great receiver but already had two great receivers in Tom Fears and Bob Shaw. Schaughnessy moved Hirsch to the flanker position behind the right end. Thus started what was known as the three-end formation.\nThis formation is most often associated with Bill Walsh's San Francisco 49ers teams of the 1980s and his West Coast Offense. It was also the favored formation of the pass-happy BYU Cougars under the tenure of legendary coach LaVell Edwards. A modern example of the \"pro-set\" can be seen in the Florida State University offense, which favors a Split Backs formation. The Seattle Seahawks under Mike Holmgren also favored this type of formation with the tight end usually being replaced with a third wide receiver.\nSingle wing.\nThis archaic formation was popular for most of the first 50 years of modern American football, but it is rare today, except as a novelty. There are many variations of the single wing with really the only common threads being that, first, rather than lining up \"under center\", the quarterback (actually called a tailback back in the day) is lined up a few yards behind with running backs generally on one side of him. Second, one of the running backs is stationed outside the end, as a wingback (hence the alternate longer name, \"single wingback formation\"). It contained two tight ends, and 4 backs. The quarterback in this formation (called at the time a \"single-wing tailback\"), like today's shotgun QB, received the snap on the fly. The other 3 backs lined up on the same side of the QB in various arrangements. Also, the formation often featured an \"unbalanced line\" where the center (that is, the player who snapped the ball) was not strictly in the \"center\" of the line, but close to the weakside. The formation was originally designed as a brute-force running formation, since it had 7 players to one side of the center and only 2 on the other.\nA well-known variation on the single wing offense would be Knute Rockne's \"Notre Dame Box\" that he ran with the Four Horsemen. The Notre Dame Box differed from the traditional single-wing in that the line was balanced and the halfback who normally played the \"wing\" in the single-wing was brought in more tightly, with the option of shifting out to the wing. These two changes made the backs' formation resemble a square (hence the \"box\") and made the formation less predictable, allowing offenses to run more easily to the \"weak\" side. Rockne's innovations with this formation involved using complicated backfield shifts and motion to confuse defenses, and adapting it as a passing formation. Teams would often adopt the Notre Dame Box if they lacked a true \"triple threat\" tailback, necessary for effective single-wing use. \nAnother variation of the single wing was the A formation.\nThe single wing has recently had a renaissance of sorts with high schools; since it is so rare, its sheer novelty can make it successful.\nWildcat.\nThe wildcat is primarily a running formation in which an athletic player (usually a running back or a receiver who runs well) takes the place of the team's usual quarterback in a shotgun formation while the quarterback lines up wide as a flanker or is replaced by another player. The ball is snapped to the runner, who usually has the option of either running the ball himself or handing it to another running back lined up in the backfield. The wildcat gives the runner a good look at the defense before the snap, allowing him to choose the best running lane. It also allows for ten offensive players to block, unlike in a conventional running play, in which the quarterback is usually not involved after delivering the ball to a running back.\nThe wildcat formation is similar to run-oriented formations used during the early days of football, but it had not been seen in the NFL for many years until the Miami Dolphins employed it during the 2008 season with running backs Ricky Williams and Ronnie Brown. The formation was successful, so many NFL and college teams began to incorporate it into their playbooks, often giving it team-specific names such as the \"Wildhog\" used by the Arkansas Razorbacks, among many other variations. Some attribute the modern origins of the \"Wildcat\" to Bill Snyder's Kansas State (whose sports teams are known as the \"Wildcats\") offense of the late ’90s and early 2000s, which featured a lot of zone read runs by the quarterback. Others attribute the origins to Hugh Wyatt, a Double Wing coach (See Double Wing discussion below).\nThough the wildcat concept was successful for a time, its effectiveness decreased as defensive coordinators prepared their teams for the change of pace play. The player receiving the snap is usually not a good passer, so defenses can bring linebackers and defensive backs closer to the line of scrimmage to clog potential running lanes. As such, its use has declined since 2009, particularly in the NFL.\nDouble wing.\nThe double wing, as a formation, is widely acknowledged to have been invented by Glenn \"Pop\" Warner in 1912. It then was an important formation up to the T formation era. For example, Dutch Meyer at TCU, with quarterback Sammy Baugh, won a college national championship in 1935 with a largely double wing offense.\nAs a modern offensive system it is widely regarded as the invention of Don Markham, which revolved around the off-tackle power play, power sweep and trap. Markham ran very few plays, but blocked them according to defensive fronts and tendencies. A noticeable difference from the other teams lined up in the double-wing formation was the lack of line splits across the front. The Double Wing is combination of the I, which Markham initially ran the offense from in his earlier days, and the Wing-T 30 Series (Power Series). It is often referred to as the \"bastard child of the I and the Wing-T\". Breaking numerous state records everywhere Markham coached (and even setting the national high school scoring record) the \"Markham Rule\" was put into place to keep his team from winning by too many points. He is currently the offensive coordinator at Hillcrest High School in the state of Idaho.\nWith Markham's success came many converts to his offense and many variations of the offense over the years. Perhaps the most well-known of Markham's converts is Hugh Wyatt, who brought more Wing-T to the offense and a greater ability to market the offense. Jerry Valloton also marketed the offense well when he wrote the first book on the offense. Since that time, Tim Murphy, Steve Calande, Jack Greggory, Robert McAdams, and several other coaches have further developed the offense and coaching materials thereof. Their materials may be seen on their respective websites.\nThe Double Wing is widely used at the youth level, becoming more popular at the high school level and has been used at the college level by \nDon Markham at American Sports University.\nShort punt formation.\nThe short punt is an older formation popular when scoring was harder and a good punt was an offensive weapon. In times when punting on second and third down was fairly common, teams would line up in the short punt formation and offer the dual threat of punt or pass. \"Harper's Weekly\" in 1915 calls it \"the most valuable formation known to football.\"\nThe formation differs in two significant ways from the single wing. It is generally a balanced formation, and there are backs on both sides of the tailback, offering better pass protection. As a result, it was considered a much better passing formation than running, as the premiere running formation was the single wing. That said, it was regarded as a good formation for trap plays.\nThe formation was used extensively by Fielding Yost's Michigan Wolverines in their early history, and was the base formation for the Benny Friedman led New York Giants in 1931. In the 1956 NFL Championship, the Chicago Bears shifted into a short punt formation in the third quarter, after falling way behind.\nShotgun.\nThe modern descendant of the Single Wing. The quarterback lines up about five yards behind the center, in order to allow a better view of the defense and more time to get a pass off. The shotgun can distribute its 3 other backs and 2 ends any number of ways, but most commonly employs one running back, lined up next to the QB, one tight end and three wide receivers. This formation is most commonly used for passing, but the quarterback can also hand off to a running back or run himself. Many college teams use variations of the shotgun as their primary formation, as do a few professional teams, such as the New England Patriots and Indianapolis Colts. Because it is generally more difficult to establish a rushing attack using only the shotgun, most NFL teams save the shotgun for obvious passing situations such as 3rd and long or when they are losing and must try to score quickly.\nThe Shotgun formation, originally called the Lonesome Quarterback, was an invention by Pop Ivy while coaching in the CFL, although Red Hickey, coach of the San Francisco 49ers is credited with bringing it to the NFL in 1960 and renaming it the Shotgun. Historically, it was used to great success as a primary formation in the NFL by the Tom Landry-led Dallas Cowboys teams of the 1970s and the 1990s Buffalo Bills teams under Marv Levy, who used a variation known as the K-gun that relied on quarterback Jim Kelly. The shotgun offense became a staple of many college football offenses beginning in the 1990s.\nPistol.\nThis offense was originated with Chris Ault at the University of Nevada, Reno. It is essentially a shotgun variation, with the quarterback lined up closer than in standard shotgun (normally 3 to 4 yards behind center), and a running back lined up behind, rather than next to, the QB (normally at 3 to 4 yards behind quarterback).\nThe pistol formation adds the dimension of a running game with the halfback being in a singleback position. This has disrupted the timing of some defenses with the way the quarterback hands the ball off to the halfback. This also allows the smaller halfbacks to hide behind the offensive line, causing opposing linebackers and pass-rushing defensive linemen to play more conservatively. The Pistol can also feature the option play. With this offense, the quarterback has the ability to get a better look past the offensive line and at the defense. Pistol formations have gained some popularity in NCAA football, and in fact, variants of this offense were used by the 2007 and 2009 BCS National Champions, LSU and Alabama, respectively.\nIn 2008, Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Chan Gailey began using the Pistol prominently in their offense, and are the first NFL team to do so. He brought the philosophy with him to the Buffalo Bills in 2010. The San Francisco 49ers added the Pistol to their offense in after former Nevada quarterback Colin Kaepernick became the team's starter. By the late 2010s, the pistol had become a favored formation of teams running the run-pass option (RPO) offense, such as the 2019 Baltimore Ravens with quarterback Lamar Jackson.\nSwinging gate.\nAn unusual formation, the swinging gate consists of a center all alone with the quarterback lined up behind him in shotgun. The rest of the offense is far away near the sideline. Both guards, both tackles, a tight end, and a receiver line up on the line of scrimmage. The running back(s) and other receivers line up in the backfield close to the lineman. One unique factor about this formation, depending on the exact alignment, is that the center can be an eligible receiver if he is the farthest outside on the line of scrimmage. The quarterback can receive the snap and choose to throw a forward pass to the center or turn and throw a pass or lateral to a back opposite the field from him and the center. \nThis formation is typically used for trick plays, though it is somewhat counterintuitively effective in short-yardage situations: a screen pass thrown to the strong side of the formation will have enough blockers to generate a push forward, and the mismatch can create enough of an advantage that the center and quarterback can provide enough blocking power to clear a path for the running back. The most recent use of this formation was in 2019, when the Miami Dolphins played the Philadelphia Eagles in the second quarter on 4th and goal when Matt Haack (normally used as a punter or a placekick holder) took the snap and flicked the ball to Jason Sanders (normally used as a placekicker) for a touchdown.\nV formation.\nOs Doenges of Oklahoma City University is credited with inventing the offensive V formation, nicknamed \"Three dots and a dash\" (Morse code for the letter \"v\"). His Oklahoma City program presented the new offensive formation to great fanfare before losing to the Southwestern Moundbuilders by a score of 7–0.\nWishbone.\nThe wishbone is a 1960s variation of the T-formation. It consists of three running backs: a fullback lined up directly behind the quarterback, and the two halfbacks split behind the fullback. It can be run with two tight ends, one tight end and one wide receiver, or two wide receivers. Most offensive systems that employ the wishbone use it as their primary formation, and most run the ball much more often than they pass. The wishbone is a common formation for the triple option offense in which the quarterback decides after the snap whether to hand the ball to the fullback for a run up the middle, pitch the ball to a running back on the outside, or keep the ball and run it himself.\nThe wishbone was developed in the 1960s by Emory Bellard, offensive coordinator at the University of Texas under head coach Darrell Royal. The offense was an immediate success, and Texas won the national championship in 1969 running a wishbone / option system. It was subsequently adopted by many other college programs in the 1970s, including Alabama and Oklahoma, who also won national titles with variations of the offense. However, as with any hugely successful formation or philosophy, as teams learned how to defend against it, it became much less successful.\nToday, the wishbone / option offense is still used by some high school and smaller college teams, but it is much less common in major college football, where teams tend to employ more pass-oriented attacks. The United States Air Force Academy (aka Air Force), the United States Naval Academy (Navy) and Georgia Tech are among the few NCAA FBS teams that commonly use the wishbone and its variations. \nThe wishbone has very rarely been used in professional football, as it was developed after passing quarterbacks became the norm. NFL quarterbacks are not necessarily good runners, and are in any case too valuable to the offense to risk injury by regularly running with the football. During the strike season of 1987, the San Francisco 49ers used the wishbone successfully against the New York Giants to win 41–21. Coach Bill Walsh used the wishbone because of his replacement quarterback's familiarity with a similar formation in college.\nFlexbone.\nThe flexbone formation is a variation of the wishbone formation. In this formation, one back (the fullback) lines up behind the quarterback. Both ends are often split wide as wide receivers, though some variations include one or two tight ends. The two remaining backs, called wingbacks or slotbacks, line up behind the line of scrimmage just outside the tackles. Usually, one of the wingbacks will go in motion behind the quarterback before the snap, potentially giving him another option to pitch to.\nLike the wishbone, the flexbone formation is commonly used to run the triple option. However, the flexbone is considered more \"flex\"-ible than the wishbone because, since the wingbacks line up on the line of scrimmage, more run / pass options and variations are possible.\nWing T.\nA formation similar to the Flexbone, though much older, is known as the \"Delaware Wing-T\" was created by longtime University of Delaware coach and NCAA Rules Committee chairman David M. Nelson, and perfected by his successor Tubby Raymond. It has become a very popular offense with high schools and small colleges. It was designed at the time to be a mix between the single wing and T-formation. It took the motion and run-strength of the single wing, and the QB-under-center from the T. In this variation, there is only one wing back, with the other back lined up next to the fullback on the opposite side from the wing back. However, the Wing Back may also line up diagonally from the Tight End. He may be used as an extra blocker or a receiver. He may come in motion for running plays.\nThe Wing T has its roots in what Otto D. Unruh called the \"T-Wing\" formation and is known to have called the play as early as 1938 with the Bethel Threshers.\nEmpty backfield.\nAlso known simply as \"Five-wide\", a reference to the five wide receivers. In the empty backfield formation, all of the backs play near the line of scrimmage to act as extra wide receivers or tight ends, with the quarterback lining up either under center or, most commonly, in the shotgun. This is almost exclusively a passing formation used to spread the field, often to open up short inside routes or screen routes. The most common running play from this formation is a quarterback draw play up the middle since defensive players are spread out from sideline to sideline. It can also be used similarly to a flexbone formation, with the receivers closest to the center acting as wing backs in an option play. This formation is most often used on obvious passing downs in the NFL and college football though some teams use it more often, such as Texas Tech University and the New England Patriots in their record-setting 2007 season.\nGoal line formation.\nAlso called \"jumbo\", \"heavy\", \"full house\" and other similar names, this formation is used exclusively in short-yardage situations, and especially near the goal line. This formation typically has no wide receivers, and often employs 3 tight ends and 2 running backs, or alternately 2 tight ends and 3 running backs. Often, a tight end or full back position is occupied by a player who normally plays offensive line or defensive line positions to act as an extra blocker. The Chicago Bears of the mid-1980s famously used defensive tackle William \"The Refrigerator\" Perry as a fullback in this formation. In most cases, it is exclusively a running formation, designed to score by brute force. Some teams have successfully used this formation for pass plays, most famously the New England Patriots, who used linebacker Mike Vrabel as a tight end to catch touchdown passes in both Super Bowl XXXVIII and Super Bowl XXXIX, two of ten completions – all for touchdowns – in fourteen such targets.\nVictory.\nA special offensive formation is used at the end of a game, when a team has a lead and simply needs to run out the clock to win the game. The \"kneel\" or \"victory\" formation was developed in the 1978 NFL season after The Miracle at the Meadowlands, a botched final play in a game between the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles that resulted in a fumble and a pivotal last-second score. This formation is intended for one purpose: to allow the quarterback to safely down the ball without losing control, preventing the defense from recovering and advancing the ball to the end zone. The formation features several stop-gaps in the event the quarterback does lose the ball: a seven-man line, the quarterback, two upbacks (running backs) immediately behind him, one at each side in the event he fumbles, and a fast player (usually a wide receiver or cornerback) several yards back as a last resort in case the defense recovers and is able to advance the ball.\nBoth the Giants and Eagles developed similar formations of this design. The Eagles named their version the \"Herman Edwards\" play after their cornerback who scored the winning touchdown on the above fateful play.\nTackle spread.\nThe tackle spread or \"Emory and Henry\" formation is an unusual American football formation that dates to the early 1950s, when the Wasps of Emory &amp; Henry College under head coach Conley Snidow used it as part of their base offense. Instead of the conventional grouping of all five ineligible offensive linemen in the middle of the formation, the Emory and Henry spreads the tackles out to the edge of the field along with two receivers or slotbacks, creating two groupings of three players near each sideline. Meanwhile, the center and the guards remain in the middle of the field along with the quarterback and a running back.\nThe formation's main usage in recent years has been as an unexpected wrinkle that attempts to confuse the defense into lining up incorrectly or blowing assignments in pass coverage. It is used exclusively as a change of pace due to its inherent limitations, namely that the tackles cannot receive forward passes or advance downfield despite their positioning, and that the diminished interior line makes the quarterback vulnerable to a quickly-arriving pass rush. The most common play out of the formation is a quick pass to a receiver on the outside which functions much like a wide receiver screen or, if defenders crowd the line of scrimmage, a quickly thrown streak route with the receiver attempting to run past them. If the defense shifts too many defenders out near the sidelines, the offense might attempt to run up the middle behind the three-man offensive line.\nThe formation has also been used as a basis for trick plays such as a backwards pass to a player near the sideline followed by forward pass down the field.\nThe Emory &amp; Henry formation was revived in the 1990s by Florida and South Carolina coach Steve Spurrier, who coined its commonly used name when he explained that he'd seen Emory and Henry College run it in the 1950s. The New England Patriots used a variation of the formation by placing a (legally declared) eligible-numbered receiver in the ineligible tackle position; the confusion this caused prompted the league to impose a rule change prohibiting that twist beginning in 2015.\nA tackle-spread formation was included in the video game \"Madden NFL 18\" under the name \"Gun Monster;\" it proved to be a problem for the game's artificial intelligence, which could not discern eligible receivers from ineligible ones.\nThe Cincinnati Bengals under Marvin Lewis occasionally used a variant of the Emory and Henry formation, which they called the \"Star Wars\" formation; in their version, both offensive tackles line up on the same side of the quarterback, thus creating a hybrid between the Emory &amp; Henry and the swinging gate.\nThe A-11 offense combines the Emory and Henry with the wildcat, in that either of the two backs in the backfield can receive the snap and act as quarterback. In its earliest incarnation, it also used a loophole in the high school rulebook that allowed players wearing any uniform number to play at either an ineligible or eligible position, further increasing defensive confusion and allowing for more flexibility among players changing positions between plays. However, this facet of the offense was never legal at the college or professional level, and the high school loophole was closed in 2009.\nDefensive formations.\nThere are no rules regarding the formation of defensive players or their movement before the snap of the ball as the choice of when to snap the ball is that of the offense which would consequently deprive the defense of an opportunity to take a set position. Therefore, the deployment and tactics of defensive players are bound only by the imagination of the play designer and the line of scrimmage. Below are some of the most popular defensive formations through the history of football.\n4–3 defense.\nThis base defense consists of four defensive linemen, three linebackers, and four defensive backs (two safeties, two corners). Against two-receiver offensive sets, this formation is effective against the run and the pass. In the original 4–3, defensive tackles would line up opposite the offensive guards, and defensive ends on the outside shoulders of the offensive tackles. On passing downs, the Mike (middle linebacker) is often responsible to cover any running backs, the Sam (strong-side linebacker) covers the Tight End, and the Will (weak-side linebacker) either covers a back or blitzes in an attempt to sack the quarterback. Though first used as a base defense by the New York Giants in 1956, plenty of teams experimented with it during the 1950s, and thus there are multiple claimed inventors of this defense. There are several different variations of the 4–3 defense such as the 4-3 under defense, 4-3 over defense, 4-3 umbrella defense, 4-3 swim defense, and 4-3 slide defense.\n&lt;br&gt;\n6–1 defense.\nThe original 6-1 was invented by Steve Owen in 1950 as a counter to the powerful passing attack of Paul Brown's Cleveland Browns. It was called the \"Umbrella\" defense because of the four defensive backs, whose crescent alignment resembled an opened umbrella, and the tactic of allowing the defensive ends to fall back into pass coverage, converting the defense, in Owen's language, from a 6–1–4 into a 4–1–6. If offenses grew wise to the drop back, the ends could pass rush instead. Using this new defense, the Giants defeated the Browns twice in 1950 during the regular season.\nIt saw use during the 1950s in Owen's hands, but never became a significant base defense. It was functionally replaced by the more versatile 4–3. Most recently the 6-1 Defense saw an appearance in Super Bowl LIII, where the New England Patriots used it to pressure the high-powering Los Angeles Rams.\n3–4 defense.\nThis is the base defense of some teams. It consists of three defensive linemen, four linebackers, and four defensive backs (two safeties, two corners). The advantage is that while 4 players still usually rush the line, the quarterback can be less sure of which of the 4 linebackers will join the 3 linemen. This formation sacrifices some size (of linemen) for speed (of linebackers), but coaches choosing to utilize this formation as their base defense typically choose larger players in the front 7 to make up for the shortage of size. In this formation, the single tackle usually lines up directly over the \"nose\" of the ball, and is often called the \"nose guard\" or \"nose tackle\". The \"Nose Tackle\" is still a DT (Defensive Tackle) with a different name. In this formation, the linemen often line up directly in front of the offensive line, while the linebackers \"shoot the gaps\". There is also a variation of this defense called the 3-4 under defense. This defense is a one gap version of the 3–4 defense.\n2–5 defense.\nThe 2-5 defense consists of two defensive linemen, five linebackers, and four defensive backs (two safety, two corners). In this variation of the 3–4, known also as the \"3–4 eagle\", the nose guard is removed from play and in his place is an extra linebacker, who lines up on the line where the nose guard would be, sometimes slightly behind where the nose guard would be. It allows defenses more flexibility in man to man coverages and zone blitzes. It was created by Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur, and evolved from Buddy Ryan's 46 defense. Shurmur created the defense in part to take advantage of the pass rush abilities of Kevin Greene, a defensive end sized linebacker. The \"eagle\" in the formation's name comes from the late 1940s-early 1950s Philadelphia Eagles coached by Greasy Neale.\nThe original Eagle defense was a 5–2 arrangement, with five defensive linemen and two linebackers. In Neale's defense, as in Shurmur's variation, the nose tackle could also drop into pass coverage, thus Shurmur's use of the Eagle defense name.\n4–4 defense.\nThe 4–4 defense consists of four defensive linemen, four linebackers, and three defensive backs (one safety, two corners). It puts \"eight men in the box\" to stop the run, but it sacrifices deep coverage against the pass, especially if the opponent's receivers are better athletes than the cornerbacks. The formation is popular in high school football as well as smaller collegiate teams. If the opposite team is a good passing team, outside linebackers are usually called on to defend slotbacks.\n5-3 defense.\nThe 5-3 defense consists of five defensive linemen, three linebackers, and three defensive backs (one safety, two corners). It appeared in the early thirties as a response to the improving passing offenses of the time, particularly the T formation. It grew in importance as the 1940s progressed, as it was more effective versus the T than the other standard defense of the time, the 6–2. By 1950, five man lines were standard in the NFL, either the 5-3 or the 5-2 Eagle. As late as the early 1950s, the Cleveland Browns were using a 5-3 as their base defense.\n6-2 defense.\nThe 6-2 defense consists of six defensive linemen, two linebackers, and three defensive backs (one safety, two corners). This was the primary defense in football, at all levels, during the single wing era (the 1930s), combining enough passing defense to handle the passing attacks of the day along with the ability to handle the power running games of the times. As the T formation grew popular in the 1940s, this formation was replaced in the NFL with the 5-3 and the 5-2 defenses. This defensive formation is still used as a \"goal line\" formation with some NFL teams.\nIn colleges, this defensive front has remained viable for a much longer period of time, because colleges, historically, have run a lot more than the NFL. Three common six man fronts seen in this more modern era are the tight six (linebackers over offensive ends, four linemen between linebackers), the wide tackle 6 (linebackers over offensive tackles, two linemen between linebackers) and the split 6 (linebackers over guard-center gap, all linemen outside linebackers).\n38 defense (split middle).\n38 refers to the positions of the defensive players on the line of scrimmage. Two \"3\" techniques (DT, lined up outside of the guards) and two \"8\" techniques (DE, lined up outside of end man on line of scrimmage). The DT's are the only down lineman. Two standup players (Monster and Rover) are in \"5\" techniques. Two Linebackers are 3 yards off the ball behind the DT's. A combination of the 4–4, 6–2, and the 46, it is designed to stop the run and to confuse offenses. 3 players in the secondary all cover deep thirds. The confusing element is either the \"5\" techniques or the \"8\" techniques can rush or drop into the flats. The LB's have hook zones. Each player on the line has a two gap responsibility.\n46 defense (forty-six).\nThis formation was invented by Buddy Ryan, defensive coordinator of the Chicago Bears during the 1980s. Instead of having four linemen and six linebackers (as the name may suggest), it is actually a 4–4 set using 4–3 personnel. This was accomplished by moving a safety up into the \"box\" instead of a fourth linebacker. The '46' refers not to any lineman/linebacker orientation but was the jersey number of hard hitting strong safety Doug Plank, the player Buddy Ryan first used in this role at Chicago. The other feature of the 46 was the placement of both \"outside\" linebackers on the same side of the formation, with the defensive line shifted the opposite way with the weak defensive end about 1 to 2 yards outside the weak offensive tackle. This defense was the philosophical equivalent of the \"Notre Dame Box\" offense devised by Knute Rockne in the 1930s, in that it used an unbalanced field and complex pre-snap motion to confuse the opposing offense. Chicago rode this defense into a 15–1 season in 1985, culminating in a 46–10 win over New England in Super Bowl XX.\n5–2 defense.\nThe 5–2 defense consists of five defensive linemen, two linebackers, and four defensive backs (two corners, two safeties). Historically, this was the first major defense with 4 defensive backs, and was used to combat the passing attacks of the time. A later evolution of the original 5-2 is the Oklahoma 5–2, which ultimately became the professional 3-4 when the defensive ends of the original 5-2 were substituted over time for the outside linebackers of the 3–4. The differences between the Oklahoma 5-2 and the 3-4 are largely semantics.\nSeven-man line defense.\nSeven-man line defenses use seven down linemen on the line of scrimmage. The most common seven-man line defenses were the 7–2–2 defense and the 7–1–2–1 defense. They were most common before the forward pass became prevalent, but were still common prior to the inception of the platoon system. They are still sometimes used in goal-line situations.\nNickel formation.\nWhile the original Nickel defense utilized 5 defensive backs in conjunction with a 4-man rush, and 2 linebackers, modern definition calls any formation that utilizes 5 defensive backs (from nickel = 5 cent piece) a Nickel defense. The Nickel defense originated as an innovation of Philadelphia Eagles defensive coach Jerry Williams in 1960 as a measure to defend star tight end Mike Ditka of the Chicago Bears. The Nickel coverage scheme is often used when the offense is using an additional wide receiver as it matches an extra cornerback against the extra receiver. The extra corner is often called a nickelback. Some variations use an extra strong safety instead of an extra cornerback. Strong safeties are often the more physical of the safeties, often resembling linebackers, so a Nickel with the extra safety can be more effective against the run than one with an extra corner. The Nickel formation comes in several varieties:\nThere are a couple paths to the 4-2-5. One is by removing a linebacker from the standard 4–3 to add the extra defensive back. The second is by converting the ends of a wide tackle six to safeties (the defensive ends of a wide tackle six already have pass defense responsibilities). A variation is the 2–4–5, which is primarily run by teams that run the 3–4 defense. They replace a defensive tackle with a corner.\nThe 3–3–5 removes a lineman to the nickelback.\nThe 33 stack uses an extra strong safety, and \"stacks\" linebackers and safeties directly behind the defensive linemen.\nThe 3–5–3 refers to a defense that has three down linemen (the \"3\" level), three linebackers and two corners (the \"5\" level), one free safety and 2 strong safeties (the \"3\" level). This is similar to a 33 stack, but with players more spread. Also called the \"umbrella\" defense or \"3-deep\". In this set, the third safety would be referred to as a \"weak safety\" (WS) and allows two position safeties at the mid-level with a third safety deep. It is because of this that the secondary safety in a football defense is called a free safety rather than a weak safety\nDime formation.\nAny defense consisting of six defensive backs. The sixth defensive back is known as the dimeback and this defense is also used in passing situations (particularly when the offense is using four wide receivers). As the extra defensive back in the nickel formation is called the nickel, two nickels gives you a dime, hence the name of the formation.\nPrevent defense.\nDefense consisting of seven (quarter) or eight (half dollar) defensive backs. The seventh defensive back is often an extra safety, and this defense is used in extreme passing situations (such as to defend against a Hail Mary pass). It is occasionally referred to as the prevent defense because of its use in preventing desperation plays. The cornerbacks and safeties in a prevent defense usually make a point of defending the goal line at the expense of receivers in the middle of the field.\nThe quarter formations are run from a 3–1–7 or a 4–0–7 in most instances; the New England Patriots have used an 0–4–7 in some instances with no down linemen. Half dollar defenses are almost always run from a 3–0–8 formation. The eighth defensive back in this case is usually a wide receiver from the offense. The wide receiver can capitalize on interception opportunities in the expected high-risk offensive play.\nUnlike other formations, the extra safety is not referred to as a quarterback or halfback (except in Canadian football), to avoid confusion with the offensive positions of the same names, but rather simply as a defensive back or a safety.\nFormations with many defensive backs positioned far from the line of scrimmage are susceptible to running plays and short passes. However, since the defense is typically used only in the last few seconds of a game when the defensive team need only keep the offense from scoring a touchdown, giving up a few yards in the middle of the field is inconsequential.\nOther variants.\nMore extreme defensive formations have been used when a coach feels that his team is at a particular disadvantage due to the opponent's offensive tactics or poor personnel match-ups.\nFor example, in 2007, New York Jets head coach Eric Mangini employed a scheme against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots that utilized only 1 defensive lineman and 6 linebackers. Prior to the snap, only the lone lineman assumed a three-point stance near the offensive center while the 6 linebackers \"roved\" up and down the line of scrimmage, attempting to confuse the quarterback as to whether they would rush the passer, drop into coverage, or play the run. This defense (combined with poor weather conditions) did slow the Patriot's passing game, but proved ineffective against the run, and the Patriots won the game.\nSpecial teams formations.\nPunting formation.\nPunting formations use a five-man offensive line, three \"upbacks\" (sometimes also referred to as \"personal protectors\") approximately 3 yards behind the line to act as an additional line of defense, two wide receivers known as \"gunners\" either to stop the punt returner or to down the ball, and the punter, 15 yards behind the line of scrimmage to receive the long snap. (If the punting team is deep in its own territory, the 15-yard distance would have to be shortened by up to 5 yards to keep the punter in front of the end line.) The number of upbacks and gunners can vary, and either position can be replaced by a tight end in a \"max protect\" situation.\nField goal formation.\nMost field goals feature nine offensive linemen (seven on the line, both ends in the tight end position, with two extra slightly off the line of scrimmage), a place holder who kneels 7 or 8 yards behind the line of scrimmage, and a kicker.\nKickoff formation.\nKickoff formations are usually in a straight line, with ten players (nine if a placeholder is used on the kickoff) lined up across the field several yards behind the ball. Many leagues require that at least four players be on each side of the kicker at the time of a kick; prior to this, an onside kick formation often had all ten of the other players on one side of the kicker. In 2011, the NFL instituted a rule requiring players other than the kicker to line up no more than 5 yards from the ball before the kick. The latter rule was instituted to prevent players from generating the speed expected from a 15-yard runup before the kick, thus potentially reducing the speed and impact of collisions down the field. \nIn 2018, the NFL further amended the rules on the kickoff formation. All players other than the kicker may now line up no more than 1 yard behind the restraining line. The rule also states that there must be five players on both sides of the ball. On each side, two players must line up outside the numbers and two players must be lined up between the numbers and the hashmarks. The NFL also made a rule regarding the receiving team's formation in 2018. Eight players on the receiving team must be lined up in the 15-yard \"set up zone\" measured from the receiving team's restraining line 10 yards from the ball.\nKick return formation.\nKick return formations vary; in most situations, an association football-like formation is used, with eleven players staggered throughout the field including two (rarely, one) kick returners back to field deep kicks, two more twenty yards ahead of them to field squib kicks, two more at about midfield mainly to assist in blocking, and five players located the minimum ten yards from the kicking line. In obvious onside kick formations, more players are moved to the front of the formation, usually top wide receivers and other players who are good at recovering and catching loose balls; this formation is known as the \"hands team\". A kick returner will usually remain back in the event of an unexpected deep kick in this situation.\nTo defend punts, the defensive line usually uses a man-on-man system with seven defensive linemen, two cornerbacks, a linebacker and a kick returner. They may choose to attempt to block the punt, or drop back to block for the receiver."

        "text": "Robert Thomas Evans (16 February 1921 – 14 April 2003) was a Welsh rugby union flanker who played club rugby for Newport and county rugby for Monmouthshire. He played ten internationals for Wales, and was selected for the British Lions playing in all six tests of the 1950 tour of Australia and New Zealand.\nEvans was a hard tackling flanker, but his skill was seen in his intelligent defensive positioning. He would often sit behind the three midfield players in offence to ensure that if passing movements broke down the opposition could not counterattack. He specialised in subduing fly-half play and would often disrupt opposing midfield trios into poor positions causing errors in play without even engaging them.\nRugby career.\nEvans won a Welsh Secondary Schools cap while at Rhymney Secondary School, and after leaving school joined the Monmouthsire Police. In 1943 he joined the Royal Air Force and played rugby for several unit teams. After he was demobbed, he rejoined the police force and was elected captain of his local rugby club at Rhymney. He was invited to play for Newport against Swansea in 1945 in a game at St Helens, and joined the black and ambers that season.\nOn 22 March 1947, Evans was selected for Wales against France at Stade Colombes. Evans was a late substitute, replacing the injured Ossie Williams, and would represent Wales on ten occasions, scoring his one and only try during his second game, in a match against Ireland.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

Competitors had to jump from a springboard over a bar to reach the vaulting horse, landing with the hands on the horse and swinging their feet to the ground. Scores were based on the height of the bar (with the maximum score of 10 with the bar set at 1.70 metres above the ground) and the performance of the jump. Each gymnast was allowed three jumps. Scores were reported as 0 to 10; it is unclear whether the three jump scores were averaged or if the highest score was used.\nThe vault was one of 11 components of the individual all-around score, and thus was also included in the team all-around score.\nResults.\nFour gymnasts received a score of 0 when they were unable to clear the bar on any of their three jumps."

There were a total number of 37 participating athletes, with five qualifying heats, two semi-finals and the final held on Tuesday 7 August 2001 at 19:50h.\nAndré Bucher came into this race having dominated these same competitors throughout the Golden League season. Bucher started hard but Wilfred Bungei pushed the break to take the lead past the bell in 50.41. As they hit the backstretch, Bucher set Bungei up and passed him with 300 metres to go. From there he just continued to pull away from Bungei, opening up over 5 metres by the finish line. The rest of the field strung out behind William Yiampoy the last pursuer. Paweł Czapiewski was dead last, 2 metres behind the back of the pack with 200 metres to go, still at the home straightaway, he had only passed Nils Schumann. Sprinting down the outside of lane 2, Czapiewski ran past the field passing Yiampoy with 12 metres to go, but too much distance to get to Bungei, Czapiewski took home bronze.\nHeats.\nHeld on Tuesday 7 August 2001"

As a result, the Irish manager, Eddie O'Sullivan, was confident that Ireland would achieve their first win over South Africa in 39 years, their only previous victory having come in Dublin in 1965.\nBy contrast, South Africa had just changed their coach to Jake White and he had radically changed the team for his first test since taking charge of the Springboks. The first of the two game test series was played at altitude in Bloemfontein and South Africa eventually won the match 31–17, despite the scores being level at 11–11 at half time.\nThe second match was played in the Newlands Stadium in Cape Town, and was a closer affair. However, South Africa maintained their unbeaten record against Ireland on home soil by winning 26–17."

The Army Ruggers are West Point's most winning team. \nIn 1980 the USA Rugby Collegiate Championship playoff system was established. Since then, the Army Rugby team has qualified for every national playoff tournament, has reached more than ten semifinals, and has finished second in the nation 3 times. In 2022, Army won the CRAA D1A National Championship. \nAll Cadet classes play and the team currently has over 60 members drawn from the United States Corps of Cadets fielding four rugby sides. \nThe Division-1 A and B sides battle for dominance in the Division 1-A Eastern division, while the C and D sides typically challenge local clubs every year.\nHistory.\nArmy rugby plays college rugby in the Division 1–A Eastern Conference. The Black Knights play their home games at the Anderson Rugby Complex on the campus of West Point. Rugby is a relatively popular sport at West Point; for example, the 2012 game against Air Force was attended by 2,000 fans. Army is currently led by Head Coach Matt Sherman, the Cadets first full-time head coach. Sherman was an All American player at Cal, leading the Bears to 4 National Championships and was previously head coach at San Diego St and Stanford.\nArmy has one of the most successful college rugby teams in the country. Army played in three consecutive national championship games from 1990 to 1992. Army reached the national semi-finals four consecutive years from 2000 to 2003, and twice in a row in 2009 and 2010. \nUnder Head Coach Rich Pohlidal, Army joined the newly formed College Premier Division (late renamed Division 1-A) in 2010. Army reached the CPD quarterfinals in 2011 before losing to Utah, and again reached the quarterfinals in 2013. Army's rugby team was briefly suspended in 2013 after several team members violated the Army's code of conduct by forwarding inappropriate emails.\nIn 2014, Army reached the ACRC Bowl final, before falling to Life University.\nArmy also plays in rugby sevens tournaments, including the Collegiate Rugby Championship, the highest profile college rugby tournament in the U.S., reaching the finals in 2011. The Collegiate Rugby Championship is played every year in early June at PPL Park in Philadelphia, and is broadcast live on NBC. Army has established a rivalry against Navy at the CRC 7s tournament. They won the inaugural Military Memorial Cup tournament at the Collegiate Rugby Championship tournament in 2012 and won the Bowl Final in 2016 with a 10-0 victory over Maryland. Their rivalry with Navy brought them to victory in 2016 where they evened out the tournament wins against Navy 2-2."

        "text": "The men's rope climbing event was part of the gymnastics programme at the 1924 Summer Olympics. It was one of nine gymnastics events and it was contested for the third time after 1896 and 1904. The competition was held on Sunday, July 20, 1924. Seventy gymnasts from nine nations competed. The event was won by Bedřich Šupčík of Czechoslovakia. Albert Séguin of France took silver, while August Güttinger of Switzerland and Ladislav Vácha tied for bronze. All three medaling nations were making their debut in rope climbing, so they were the first medals for each in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the third appearance of the event, which was held four times. The event had been held in 1896 and 1904 and would appear again in 1932. The event was an unusual one, not one of the standard apparatus competitions held at the world championships. The Official Report commented that it appeared some nations had considered the event less important than the other apparatus events on the 1924 programme.\nThe United States and Great Britain were the only two nations to have competed in one of the prior rope climbing competitions (in 1904 and 1896, respectively); the other seven nations all made their debut in the event.\nCompetition format.\nThe rope climbing event was judged on time, with the fastest to reach the top winning.\nThe times were also converted into points for use in the individual and team all-around scores, as the rope climbing was one of the 11 components of the 1924 all-around competition. \nThe points were as follows:\nThus, a time of 10.0 seconds was worth 5 points, while any gymnast taking 12.0 seconds or more would receive zero points for the exercise."

        "text": "The men's artistic individual all-around event was part of the gymnastics programme at the 1924 Summer Olympics. It was one of nine gymnastics events and it was contested for the sixth time. The competition was held from Thursday, 17 July 1924, to Wednesday, 23 July 1924. Seventy-two gymnasts from nine nations competed. Each nation could send up to 8 gymnasts, up from 6 in previous Games. For the first time since 1904, the scores for individual competitors were used to calculate a team score (the team events were completely separate from 1908 to 1920). The men's artistic individual all-around was won by Leon Štukelj of Yugoslavia. Czechoslovakia's Robert Pražák took silver, while Bedřich Šupčík earned bronze. Both nations were making their debut in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the sixth appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nFour of the top 10 gymnasts from the 1920 Games returned: gold medalist Giorgio Zampori of Italy, bronze medalist Jean Gounot of France, seventh-place finisher Luigi Maiocco of Italy, and tenth-place finisher Frank Kriz of the United States. Neither of the 1922 World co-champions competed in Paris, but third-place finisher Stane Derganc of Yugoslavia did.\nCzechoslovakia and Yugoslavia each made their debut in the event. France and Italy each made their fifth appearance, tied for most among nations, both having missed only the 1904 Games in St. Louis.\nCompetition format.\nThe format for the all-around competition varied widely at early Games. With individual apparatus events returning to the programme for the first time since 1904, the 1924 all-around competition returned to the aggregate scoring method. The all-around score was the sum of scores in the 7 apparatus events. This resulted in a total of 11 exercises, with both compulsory and optional exercises in the parallel bars, horizontal bar, rings, and pommel horse as well as optional exercises on the \"regular\" and \"sidehorse\" vaults and a rope climb. Scores for the four two-exercise apparati were from 0 to 11 (half-point for approach and dismount in addition to 0-10 for the exercise itself), while scores for the two types of vault and the rope climb were from 0 to 10. This led to a maximum total score of 118.\nResults.\nResults are listed in what appears to have been the Olympic Order of the time. Current Olympic Order (as of 2019, and as of the last few decades) is very different from what occurred in this and previous competitions. Contextual details strongly suggest that this is the order in which the gymnasts competed - High bar, Parallel bars, Rings, Rope Climb, Vault (two separate apparatus set-ups on this occasion - \"Over bar\" and \"regular\"; the \"regular\" was actually the sidehorse vault), and, lastly, Pommel horse."

        "title": "1981 Ireland rugby union tour of South Africa",
        "text": "The 1981 Ireland rugby union tour of South Africa was a series of matches played by the Ireland national rugby union team in South Africa in the May and June of 1981. The Irish team played seven matches, of which they won three. They lost the Test Series 2–0 to the Springboks.\nMatches.\nIreland embarked on their first tour to South Africa after a twenty-year absence on the back of a five nations championship which they were widely considered to be favourites to win but ended with four defeats, having lost all their matches for the first time since 1977. Despite condemnation from political and ecclesiastical sources, the IRFU honoured their promise to undertake a seven match tour against multiracial sides and included twelve uncapped players as well as half a dozen former British and Irish Lions in the touring party. A number of players had resigned their posts when employers declined to grant leave of absence for the tour whilst others had no option but to simply declare their unavailability.\nOf the seven matches played, the majority including both test matches were lost. Injuries to two key players proved difficult to overcome. John Robbie (later to become a non-capped Springbok) injured a shoulder in the first half of the opening fixture and only gained match fitness in the last few days of the tour whilst Ollie Campbell only played twice on tour, his replacement Mick Quinn having last played international rugby in March 1977.\nAhead of the Gazelles fixture (the SA U-24 side), much had been made of the attacking potential of the Irish three-quarters yet on the day the only points Ireland scored in front of a 35,000 crowd were through the boot of Kevin O'Brien as the tourists were outplayed in the line-out through the work of lock Skinner. There was nothing particularly undersized about the under-24 side featuring a number of future Springboks in their ranks including Jannie Breedt, the 21 stone Flippie van der Merwe and Piet Kruger as props and 6'9\" Vleis Visagie at lock. Future Springbok coach Carel du Plessis scored one try from the wing playing alongside SARFF's Wilfred Cupido, one of four coloured players included in the list of the sixty-four trialists ahead of the three test series in New Zealand later on in the year.\nThe second fixture played at Olën Park, featuring Mike Slemen's unforgettable try during the 1980 BIRUT tour, saw Ireland take on fairly underwhelming opposition in the guise of the Gold Mining Invitation XV. Solomon Mhlaba, a tourist to the UK with the 1979 SA Baa Baas started at full back for the GMI but he saw little of the ball to demonstrate his attacking prowess as Ireland ran in seven tries with John Murphy contributing a total of eighteen points via his boot from fullback.\nThere were first caps for Murphy, Paul Dean and Jerry Holland at Newlands, a game which Ireland could undoubtedly have won, matching the Springbok pack in all phases of the game but they were seriously undermined and derailed by injuries to both Murphy and Campbell, which ultimately ruled both players out for the remainder of the tour. \nThe Irish pack simply surpassed themselves throughout the second test at Kings Park with the back row of O'Driscoll, Slattery and Duggan quite magnificent as the bigger Springbok pack were outplayed in every phase of the game. Holding a 7–6 half time lead courtesy of a searing try from full back O'Brien and a Quinn penalty to a Botha drop goal and penalty, another Quinn penalty extended the lead out to 10–6. Yet a further two Botha drop goals were to deprive Ireland of their glory, as he became only the fourth player in history to drop three goals in a test, his final effort being only minutes from the end of the game.\nTouring party.\nFull backs.\nJohn Murphy* (Greystones); K A O'Brien (Broughton Park);\nThree-quarters.\nFreddie McLennan (Wanderers); Keith Crossan* (Instonians); David Irwin (Queen's University); A W Irwin* (Queens' University): John Hewitt*(NIFC); Michael Kiernan*(Lansdowne); Terry Kennedy (St. Mary's College);\nHalf-backs.\nPaul Dean* (St.Mary's College); Ollie Campbell(Old Belvedere) [rep: M A M Quinn(Lansdowne)]; John Robbie (Greystones) [rep: J B O' Connor*(Palmerston)] Robbie McGrath (Wanderers);\nForwards.\nPhil Orr (Old Wesley); John Cantrell (UCD); Harry Harbison* (UCD); Gerry McLoughlin (Shannon); Des Fitzgerald* (Lansdowne); Brendan Foley (Shannon); J J Holland*(Cork Constitution); G H Wallace* (Old Wesley); John O'Driscoll (London Irish); Fergus Slattery (Blackrock College); R K Kearney* (Wanderers); Willie Duggan (Blackrock College); A F O'Leary* (Cork Constitution)"

Justin Fitzpatrick and Trevor Brennan also made their senior international debuts in the same game. A fourth debutant, Justin Bishop, scored a try while Eric Elwood added a conversion and two penalties. South Africa won the series 2-0, but the series was marred by violence and ill-will between the two teams.\nTest matches.\nFirst Test.\nMany predicted South Africa, who were wearing white jerseys due to the colour clash with Ireland's green jumper, to win their first test match of the season comfortably. While they eventually did so, the visitors competed admirably in the first half, trailing by only three points at half time, 13−10. The Springboks, who looked rusty in the first half, finally clicked in the second half and debutant winger Stefan Terblanche scored four tries.\nSecond Test.\nThe Springboks had to make one change to their line-up for the second test in Pretoria, with Gaffie du Toit unavailable due to a rib injury and replaced by Franco Smith. The Springboks completed a shut-out to seal the series and scored five tries in the process, but the match was a very spiteful one marred by numerous cynical incidents and brawls which eventually resulted in Springbok lock Krynauw Otto getting time in the sin bin."

The twelve founding clubs were Ashford, Aylesford Paper Mills, Dartford, Dover, Folkestone, Gore Court, Gravesend, Holmesdale, The Mote, St Lawrence and Highland Court, Sevenoaks Vine, and Tunbridge Wells.\nBeckenham, Blackheath, and Bromley joined the league before the 1973 season. Aylesford Paper Mills left after the 1976 season but were replaced by Forest Hill, and then Bexley joined for the 1978 season. Forest Hill closed down in 1980, but Hayes (Kent) and Midland Bank (now New Beckenham) joined in 1982 to bring the number of clubs in the league up to seventeen.\nA major change took place before the 1996 season, when the league absorbed the East Kent Cricket League and the South Thames Cricket League. A new structure with three divisions was introduced, and for the first time there was promotion and relegation.\nFrom 1999 the Kent League was a designated ECB Premier League. From 1999 to 2002, the league experimented with matches played over two days on consecutive Saturdays and was the only ECB Premier League to do this, but it reverted to one day cricket in time for the 2003 season.\nUntil the 2019 season the Kent League had six divisions each containing ten clubs, and below these six divisions lay the Kent Regional Cricket League. The two leagues amalgamated in time for the 2023 season, when there was a total of thirty divisions. \nThe 2020 competition was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Kent Cricket League was the only ECB Premier League in England which chose not to organise any kind of replacement competition for the later part of the season when cricket again became possible. Normal service was resumed when a full season of competitive matches was held in 2021.\nThe teams competing in the Premier Division in 2024 are expected to be Bexley, Bickley Park, Blackheath, Canterbury, Hayes, Lordswood, Minster, St Lawrence and Highland Court, Sandwich Town, and Tunbridge Wells."

Uruguay and Argentina contested in what was a rematch of the gold medal match of the 1928 Olympics, which Uruguay won after a replay.\nThe final was played at the Estadio Centenario in Montevideo, Uruguay, on 30 July, a Wednesday. It was one of only two World Cup finals to be played on a day other than Sunday, the other being the 1966 FIFA World Cup final, which was played on a Saturday. A disagreement overshadowed the build-up to the match as which team would provide the match ball. FIFA intervened with a compromise, that Argentina would provide the ball for the first half, and Uruguay for the second.\nThe stadium gates were opened at eight in the morning, six hours before kick-off, and at noon the ground was full, officially holding 93,000 people. Uruguay successfully \"defended\" its Olympic gold medal achievement 4–2, coming back from a 2–1 deficit at half-time. \nUruguay manager Alberto Suppici was 31 at the time, and still holds the record for being youngest coach of a FIFA World Cup winning team. Jules Rimet, president of FIFA, presented Uruguay with the World Cup Trophy, later to be named after him. The following day was declared a national holiday in Uruguay. In Buenos Aires, a mob threw stones at the Uruguayan consulate.\nThe last living player from the final was Argentine striker Francisco Varallo, who died on 30 August 2010 aged 100. The last living Uruguayan from the final was Ernesto Mascheroni, who died on 3 July 1984 aged 76.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nAfter 12 minutes, Pablo Dorado put the hosts into the lead, before Argentina winger Carlos Peucelle equalised 8 minutes later, beating goalkeeper Enrique Ballestrero with a powerful shot. In the 37th minute, tournament top scorer Guillermo Stábile gave Argentina a 2–1 lead going into the break. Uruguay leveled the score 12 minutes into the second half via a goal from Pedro Cea, and took the lead back for good with a Santos Iriarte goal in the 68th minute. With a minute remaining, Héctor Castro put Uruguay up 4–2, sealing victory in the inaugural World Cup.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules"

This final, between Brazil and Italy, marked the first time that two former world champions met in a final; Italy had previously won the World Cup in 1934 and 1938, while Brazil won in 1958 and 1962.\nRoute to the final.\nBefore the finals in Mexico, Brazil had to play qualifying matches against Colombia, Venezuela and Paraguay. Brazil was far superior, winning all six games, scoring twenty-three goals and conceding only two. In the last match of the qualifying round, Brazil beat Paraguay 1–0 and had the largest official audience ever recorded for a football match, with 183,341 spectators in Brazil's Maracanã Stadium. In total, the Brazilian team won all 12 games, scoring 42 goals and conceding only 8.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nBrazil struck first, with Pelé heading in a cross by Rivellino at the 18th minute. Roberto Boninsegna equalized for Italy after a blunder in the Brazilian defence. In the second half, Brazil's firepower and creativity was too much for an Italian side that clung to their cautious defensive system. Gérson fired in a powerful shot for the second goal, and then helped provide the third, with a long free kick to Pelé who headed down into the path of the onrushing Jairzinho. Pelé capped his superb performance by drawing the Italian defence in the centre and feeding captain Carlos Alberto on the right flank for the final score. Carlos Alberto's goal, after a series of moves by the Brazilian team from the left to the centre, is considered one of the greatest goals ever scored in the history of the tournament.\nA total of seven outfield players from Brazil passed the ball until captain Carlos Alberto hammered the ball into the corner of the Italian goal following a pass across the Italian penalty area from Pelé, prompted by Tostão, who, with his back to the goal, told Pelé that Alberto was steaming in on the right flank. Tostão started the move five yards from the left of the Brazilian penalty area, then ran the length of the field to the Italian box without touching the ball again to tell Pelé to lay it off for Alberto. The players involved in the passes in order were Tostão, Brito, Clodoaldo, Pelé and Gérson. Clodoaldo beat four Italian players in his own half before passing to Rivellino who hit a perfect pass down the wing to Jairzinho. Jairzinho crossed from the wing to the centre of the box to Pelé who held the ball up to play a pass for Alberto to smash it home. The only outfield players not involved in the move were Everaldo and Piazza. In 2002, the UK public voted the goal as number 36 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules:\nPost-match.\nWith this third win after their 1958 and 1962 World Cup victories, Brazil became the world's most successful national football team at that time, surpassing both Italy and Uruguay, who each had two championships. The third title earned Brazil the right to retain the Jules Rimet Trophy permanently; it was stolen in 1983 while on display in Rio de Janeiro and never recovered. Thirty-eight-year-old Brazilian coach Mário Zagallo became the first footballer to win the World Cup as a player (1958, 1962) and a coach, as well the second youngest coach to win a World Cup, after Alberto Suppici in 1930. Pelé ended his World Cup playing career as the competition's first three-time winner."

        "title": "Golf",
        "text": "Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit a ball into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible.\nGolf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not use a standardized playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game. Courses typically have either 9 or 18 \"holes\", regions of terrain that each contain a \"cup\", the hole that receives the ball. Each hole on a course contains a teeing ground to start from, and a putting green containing the cup. There are several standard forms of terrain between the tee and the green, such as the fairway, rough (tall grass), and various \"hazards\" such as water, rocks, or sand-filled \"bunkers\". Each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout.\nGolf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual, known as stroke play, or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team, known as match play. Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels, especially at the elite level.\nThe modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland. The 18-hole round was created at the Old Course at St Andrews in 1764. Golf's first major, and the world's oldest golf tournament, is The Open Championship, also known as the British Open, which was first played in 1860 at the Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire, Scotland. This is one of the four major championships in men's professional golf, the other three being played in the United States: The Masters, the U.S. Open, and the PGA Championship.\nOrigin and history.\nWhile the modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland, the game's ancient origins are unclear and much debated.\nSome historians trace the sport back to the Roman game of paganica, in which participants used a bent stick to hit a stuffed leather ball. One theory asserts that paganica spread throughout Europe as the Romans conquered most of the continent, during the first century BC, and eventually evolved into the modern game.\nOthers cite chuiwan (捶丸; \"chui\" means striking and \"wan\" means small ball) as the progenitor, a Chinese game played between the eighth and fourteenth centuries. A Ming Dynasty scroll by the artist Youqiu dating back to 1368 entitled \"The Autumn Banquet\" shows a member of the Chinese Imperial court swinging what appears to be a golf club at a small ball with the aim of sinking it into a hole. The game is thought to have been introduced into Europe during the Middle Ages.\nAnother early game that resembled modern golf was known as cambuca in England and chambot in France. The Persian game chowkan is another possible ancient origin, albeit being more polo-like. In addition, kolven (a game involving a ball and curved bats) was played annually in Loenen, Netherlands, beginning in 1297, to commemorate the capture of the assassin of Floris V, a year earlier.\nThe modern game originated in Scotland, where the first written record of golf is James II's banning of the game in 1457, as an unwelcome distraction to learning archery. James IV lifted the ban in 1502 when he became a golfer himself, with golf clubs first recorded in 1503–1504: \"For golf clubbes and balles to the King that he playit with\". To many golfers, the Old Course at St Andrews, a links course dating to before 1574, is considered to be a site of pilgrimage. In 1764, the standard 18-hole golf course was created at St Andrews when members modified the course from 22 to 18 holes. Golf is documented as being played on Musselburgh Links, East Lothian, Scotland as early as 2 March 1672, which is certified as the oldest golf course in the world by \"Guinness World Records\". The oldest surviving rules of golf were compiled in March 1744 for the Company of Gentlemen Golfers, later renamed The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, which was played at Leith, Scotland. The world's oldest golf tournament in existence, and golf's first major, is The Open Championship, which was first played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club, in Ayrshire, Scotland, with Scottish golfers winning the earliest majors. Two Scotsmen from Dunfermline, John Reid and Robert Lockhart, first demonstrated golf in the U.S. by setting up a hole in an orchard in 1888, with Reid setting up America's first golf club the same year, Saint Andrew's Golf Club in Yonkers, New York.\nGolf course.\nA golf course consists of either 9 or 18 holes, each with a teeing ground or \"tee box\" that is set off by two markers showing the bounds of the legal tee area, fairway, rough and other hazards, and the putting green surrounded by the fringe with the pin (normally a flagstick) and cup.\nThe levels of grass are varied to increase difficulty, or to allow for putting in the case of the green. While many holes are designed with a direct line-of-sight from the teeing area to the green, some holes may bend either to the left or to the right. This is commonly called a \"dogleg\", in reference to a dog's knee. The hole is called a \"dogleg left\" if the hole angles leftwards and \"dogleg right\" if it bends right. Sometimes, a hole's direction may bend twice; this is called a \"double dogleg\".\nA regular golf course consists of 18 holes, but nine-hole courses are common and can be played twice through for a full round of 18 holes.\nEarly Scottish golf courses were primarily laid out on links land, soil-covered sand dunes directly inland from beaches. The word \"links\" derives from the Scots language and the Old English word \"hlinc\" (\"rising ground, ridge\"): traditionally these are coastal sand dunes but sometimes open parkland. This gave rise to the term \"golf links\", particularly applied to seaside courses and those built on naturally sandy soil inland.\nThe first 18-hole golf course in the United States was on a sheep farm in Downers Grove, Illinois, in 1892. The course is still there today.\nPlay of the game.\nEvery round of golf is based on playing a number of holes in a given order. A \"round\" typically consists of 18 holes that are played in the order determined by the course layout. Each hole is played once in the round on a standard course of 18 holes. The game can be played by any number of people, although a typical group will have 1–4 people playing the round. The typical amount of time required for pace of play is two hours for a 9-hole round and four hours for an 18-hole round.\nPlaying a hole on a golf course is initiated by putting a ball into play by striking it with a club on the teeing ground (also called the tee box, or simply the tee). For this first shot on each hole, it is allowed but not required for the golfer to place the ball on a tee prior to striking it. A tee is a small peg that can be used to elevate the ball slightly above the ground up to a few centimetres high. Tees are commonly made of wood but may be constructed of any material, including plastic. Traditionally, golfers used mounds of sand to elevate the ball, and containers of sand were provided for the purpose. A few courses still require sand to be used instead of peg tees, to reduce litter and reduce damage to the teeing ground. Tees help reduce the interference of the ground or grass on the movement of the club making the ball easier to hit, and also places the ball in the very centre of the striking face of the club (the \"sweet spot\") for better distance.\nWhen the initial shot on a hole is intended to move the ball a long distance, typically more than , the shot is commonly called a \"drive\" and is generally made with a long-shafted, large-headed wood club called a \"driver\". Shorter holes may be initiated with other clubs, such as higher-numbered woods or irons. Once the ball comes to rest, the golfer strikes it again as many times as necessary using shots that are variously known as a \"lay-up\", an \"approach\", a \"pitch\", or a \"chip\", until the ball reaches the green, where the golfer then \"putts\" the ball into the hole (commonly called \"sinking the putt\" or \"holing out\"). The goal of getting the ball into the hole (\"holing\" the ball) in as few strokes as possible may be impeded by obstacles such as areas of longer grass called \"rough\" (usually found alongside fairways), which both slows any ball that contacts it and makes it harder to advance a ball that has stopped on it; \"doglegs\", which are changes in the direction of the fairway that often require shorter shots to play around them; bunkers (or sand traps); and water hazards such as ponds or streams.\nIn stroke play competitions each player plays their ball until it is holed no matter how many strokes that may take. In match play it is acceptable to simply pick up one's ball and \"surrender the hole\" after enough strokes have been made by a player that it is mathematically impossible for the player to win the hole. It is also acceptable in informal stroke play to surrender the hole after hitting three strokes more than the \"par\" rating of the hole (a \"triple bogey\" – see below); while technically a violation of Rule 3–2, this practice speeds play as a courtesy to others, and avoids \"runaway scores\" and excessive frustration.\nThe total distance from the first teeing ground to the 18th green can be quite long; total yardages \"through the green\" can be in excess of , and when adding in the travel distance between the green of one hole and the tee of the next, even skilled players may easily travel or more during a round. At some courses, gas or electric golf carts are used to travel between shots, which can speed-up play and allows participation by individuals unable to walk a whole round. On other courses players generally walk the course, either carrying their bag using a shoulder strap or using a \"golf trolley\" for their bag. These trolleys may or may not be battery assisted. At many amateur tournaments including U.S. high school and college play, players are required to walk and to carry their own bags, but at the professional and top amateur level, as well as at high-level private clubs, players may be accompanied by caddies, who carry and manage the players' equipment and who are allowed by the rules to give advice on the play of the course.\nRules and regulations.\nThe rules of golf are internationally standardised and are jointly governed by The R&amp;A, spun off in 2004 from The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews (founded 1754), and the United States Golf Association (USGA). With the aim of simplifying the rules, in 2017 the USGA and R&amp;A undertook a complete rewrite. The new rule book came into effect in January 2019.\nThe underlying principle of the rules is fairness. As stated on the back cover of the official rule book:\nThere are strict regulations regarding the amateur status of golfers. Essentially, anybody who has ever received payment or compensation for giving instruction, or played golf for money, is not considered an amateur and may not participate in competitions limited solely to amateurs. However, amateur golfers may receive expenses that comply with strict guidelines and they may accept non-cash prizes within the limits established by the Rules of Amateur Status.\nIn addition to the officially printed rules, golfers also abide by a set of guidelines called golf etiquette. Etiquette guidelines cover matters such as safety, fairness, pace of play, and a player's obligation to contribute to the care of the course. Though there are no penalties for breach of etiquette rules, players generally follow the rules of golf etiquette in an effort to improve everyone's playing experience.\nPenalties.\nPenalty strokes are incurred in certain situations and are counted towards a player's score as if there were extra swing(s) at the ball. Either one or two strokes are added for most rule infractions or for taking relief from various situations, with the \"general penalty\" defined as two-strokes, and disqualification for severe or repeated rule breaches. Examples include:\nEquipment.\nGolf clubs are used to hit a golf ball. Each club is composed of a shaft with a lance (or \"grip\") on the top end and a club head on the bottom. Long clubs, which have a lower amount of degree loft, are those meant to propel the ball a comparatively longer distance, and short clubs a higher degree of loft and a comparatively shorter distance. The actual physical length of each club is longer or shorter, depending on the distance the club is intended to propel the ball.\nGolf clubs have traditionally been arranged into three basic types. Woods are large-headed, long-shafted clubs meant to propel the ball a long distance from relatively \"open\" lies, such as the teeing ground and fairway. Of particular importance is the \"driver\" or \"1-wood\", which is the lowest lofted wood club, and in modern times has become highly specialized for making extremely long-distance tee shots, up to , or more, in a professional golfer's hands. Traditionally these clubs had heads made of a hardwood, hence the name, but virtually all modern woods are now made of metal such as titanium, or of composite materials. Irons are shorter-shafted clubs with a metal head primarily consisting of a flat, angled striking face. Traditionally the clubhead was forged from iron; modern iron clubheads are investment-cast from a steel alloy. Irons of varying loft are used for a variety of shots from virtually anywhere on the course, but most often for shorter-distance shots approaching the green, or to get the ball out of tricky lies such as sand traps. The third class is the putter, which evolved from the irons to create a low-lofted, balanced club designed to roll the ball along the green and into the hole. Putters are virtually always used on the green or in the surrounding rough/fringe. A fourth class, called hybrids, evolved as a cross between woods and irons, and are typically seen replacing the low-lofted irons with a club that provides similar distance, but a higher launch angle and a more forgiving nature.\nA maximum of 14 clubs is allowed in a player's bag at one time during a stipulated round. The choice of clubs is at the golfer's discretion, although every club must be constructed in accordance with parameters outlined in the rules. (Clubs that meet these parameters are usually called \"conforming\".) Violation of these rules can result in disqualification.\nThe exact shot hit at any given time on a golf course, and which club is used to accomplish the shot, are always completely at the discretion of the golfer; in other words, there is no restriction whatsoever on which club a golfer may or may not use at any time for any shot.\nGolf balls are spherical, usually white (although other colours are allowed), and minutely pock-marked by dimples that decrease aerodynamic drag by increasing air turbulence around the ball in motion, which delays \"boundary layer\" separation and reduces the drag-inducing \"wake\" behind the ball,\nthereby allowing the ball to fly farther. The combination of a soft \"boundary layer\" and a hard \"core\" enables both distance and spin.\nA tee is allowed only for the first stroke on each hole, unless the player must hit a provisional tee shot or replay their first shot from the tee.\nMany golfers wear golf shoes with metal or plastic spikes designed to increase traction, thus allowing for longer and more accurate shots.\nA golf bag is used to transport golf clubs and the player's other or personal equipment. Golf bags have several pockets designed for carrying equipment and supplies such as tees, balls, and gloves. Golf bags can be carried, pulled on a trolley or harnessed to a motorized golf cart during play. Golf bags usually have both a hand strap and shoulder strap for carrying, others may be carried over both shoulders like a backpack, and often bags have retractable legs that allow the bag to stand upright when at rest.\nStroke mechanics.\nThe golf swing is outwardly similar to many other motions involving swinging a tool or playing implement, such as an axe or a baseball bat. However, unlike many of these motions, the result of the swing is highly dependent on several sub-motions being properly aligned and timed. These ensure that the club travels up to the ball in line with the desired path; that the clubface is in line with the swing path; and that the ball hits the centre or \"sweet spot\" of the clubface. The ability to do this consistently, across a complete set of clubs with a wide range of shaft lengths and clubface areas, is a key skill for any golfer, and takes a significant effort to achieve.\nStance.\nStance refers to how the golfer positions themselves in order to play a stroke; it is fundamentally important in being able to play a stroke effectively. The stance adopted is determined by what stroke is being played. All stances involve a slight crouch. This allows for a more efficient striking posture whilst also isometrically preloading the muscles of the legs and core; this allows the stroke to be played more dynamically and with a greater level of overall control. When adopting their stance golfers start with the non-dominant side of the body facing the target (for a right-hander, the target is to their left). Setting the stance in regard to the position of the ball, and placing the clubhead behind the ball, is known as being at address; when in this position the player's body and the centerline of the club face are positioned parallel to the desired line of travel, with the feet either perpendicular to that line or slightly splayed outward. The feet are commonly shoulder-width apart for middle irons and putters, narrower for short irons and wider for long irons and woods. The ball is typically positioned more to the \"front\" of the player's stance (closer to the leading foot) for lower-lofted clubs, with the usual ball position for a drive being just behind the arch of the leading foot. The ball is placed further \"back\" in the player's stance (toward the trailing foot) as the loft of the club to be used increases. Most iron shots and putts are made with the ball roughly centered in the stance, while a few mid- and short-iron shots are made with the ball slightly behind the centre of the stance to ensure consistent contact between the ball and clubface, so the ball is on its way before the club continues down into the turf.\nStrokes.\nThe golfer chooses a golf club, grip, and stroke appropriate to the distance:\nHaving chosen a club and stroke to produce the desired distance, the player addresses the ball by taking their stance to the side of it and (except when the ball lies in a hazard) grounding the club behind the ball. The golfer then takes their backswing, rotating the club, their arms and their upper body away from the ball, and then begins their swing, bringing the clubhead back down and around to hit the ball. A proper golf swing is a complex combination of motions, and slight variations in posture or positioning can make a great deal of difference in how well the ball is hit and how straight it travels. The general goal of a player making a full swing is to propel the clubhead as fast as possible while maintaining a single \"plane\" of motion of the club and clubhead, to send the clubhead into the ball along the desired path of travel and with the clubhead also pointing that direction.\nAccuracy and consistency are typically stressed over pure distance. A player with a straight drive that travels only will nevertheless be able to accurately place the ball into a favourable lie on the fairway, and can make up for the lesser distance of any given club by simply using \"more club\" (a lower loft) on their tee shot or on subsequent fairway and approach shots. However, a golfer with a drive that may go but often does not fly straight will be less able to position their ball advantageously; the ball may \"hook\", \"pull\", \"draw\", \"fade\", \"push\" or \"slice\" off the intended line and land out of bounds or in the rough or hazards, and thus the player will require many more strokes to hole out.\nMusculature.\nA golf stroke uses the muscles of the core (especially erector spinae muscles and latissimus dorsi muscle when turning), hamstring, shoulder, and wrist. Stronger muscles in the wrist can prevent them from being twisted during swings, whilst stronger shoulders increase the turning force. Weak wrists can also transmit the force to elbows and even neck and lead to injury. (When a muscle contracts, it pulls equally from both ends and, to have movement at only one end of the muscle, other muscles must come into play to stabilize the bone to which the other end of the muscle is attached.) Golf is a unilateral exercise that can break body balances, requiring exercises to keep the balance in muscles.\nTypes of putting.\nPutting is considered to be the most important component of the game of golf. As the game of golf has evolved, there have been many different putting techniques and grips that have been devised to give golfers the best chance to make putts. When the game originated, golfers would putt with their dominant hand on the bottom of the grip and their weak hand on top of the grip. This grip and putting style is known as \"conventional\". There are many variations of conventional including overlap, where the golfer overlaps the off hand index finger onto off the dominant pinky; interlock, where the offhand index finger interlocks with the dominant pinky and ring finger; double or triple overlap and so on. Recently, \"cross handed\" putting has become a popular trend amongst professional golfers and amateurs. Cross handed putting is the idea that the dominant hand is on top of the grip where the weak hand is on the bottom. This grip restricts the motion in your dominant hand and eliminates the possibility of wrist breakdowns through the putting stroke.\nOther notable putting styles include \"the claw\", a style that has the grip directly in between the thumb and index finger of the dominant hand while the palm faces the target. The weak hand placed normally on the putter. Anchored putting, a style that requires a longer putter shaft that can be anchored into the player's stomach or below the chin; the idea is to stabilize one end of the putter thus creating a more consistent pendulum stroke. This style has been banned on professional circuits since 2016.\nScoring and handicapping.\nPar.\nA hole is classified by its par, which gives an indication of the number of strokes a skilled golfer may be expected to need to complete play of the hole. The primary factor for classifying the par of a relatively straight, hazard-free hole is the distance from the tee to the green, and calculates the number of strokes a skilled golfer is expected to require to reach the green with an additional allowance of 2 putts. As such, the minimum par of any hole is 3; one stroke for the tee shot and two putts. Par 3, 4 and 5 holes are commonplace on golf courses; far more rarely, courses may feature par-6 and even par-7 holes.\nFor men, a typical par-3 hole is less than in length, with a par-4 hole ranging between , and a par-5 hole being longer than ; for women these boundaries are lower, and for professionals they are much increased. The rare par-6s can stretch well over . These distances are based on the typical scratch golfer's drive distance of between . Although length is the primary factor in calculating par, other factors are taken into account; however the number of strokes a scratch golfer should take to make the green remains foremost. Factors affecting the calculation include altitude, gradient of the land from the tee to green, and forced \"lay-ups\" due to dog-legs (sharp bends) or obstacles (e.g. bunkers, water hazards).\nGetting the ball onto the green in two strokes less than par, and hence meeting the par calculation criteria, is called making \"green in regulation\" or GIR. Missing a GIR does not necessarily mean a golfer will not make par, but it does make doing so more difficult as it reduces the number of putts available; conversely, making a GIR does not guarantee a par, as the player might require three or more putts to \"hole out\". Professional golfers typically make between 60% and 70% of greens in regulation.\nEighteen-hole courses typically total to an overall par score of 70 to 72 for a complete round; with most holes having a par of 4, and a smaller number of par-3 and par-5 holes. Additionally, courses may be classified according to their play difficulty, which may be used to calculate a golfer's handicap. The two primary difficulty ratings in the U.S. are the Course Rating, which is the expected score for a zero-handicap \"scratch golfer\", and the Slope Rating, which is a measure of how much worse a \"bogey golfer\" (handicap around 20) would be expected to play than a \"scratch golfer\" relative to their handicap.\nScoring.\nThe goal is to play as few strokes per round as possible. A golfer's number of strokes in a hole, course, or tournament is compared to its respective par score, and is then reported either as the number that the golfer was \"under-\" or \"over-par\", or if it was \"equal to par\". A hole in one (or an \"ace\") occurs when a golfer sinks their ball into the cup with their first stroke from the tee. Common scores for a hole also have specific terms.\nIn a typical professional tournament or among \"scratch\" amateur players, \"birdie-bogey\" play is common; a player will \"lose\" a stroke by bogeying a hole, then \"gain\" one by scoring a birdie. Eagles are uncommon but not rare; however, only 18 players have scored an albatross in a men's major championship. One of the rarest feats in golf is the condor, which has never occurred in a professional tournament. Only five condors have been verified to have ever occurred, although none of the courses involved were professionally accredited.\nBasic forms of golf.\nThere are two basic forms of golf play, match play and stroke play. Stroke play is more popular.\nMatch play.\nTwo players (or two teams) play each hole as a separate contest against each other in what is called match play. The party with the lower score wins that hole, or if the scores of both players or teams are equal the hole is \"halved\" (or tied). The game is won by the party that wins more holes than the other. In the case that one team or player has taken a lead that cannot be overcome in the number of holes remaining to be played, the match is deemed to be won by the party in the lead, and the remainder of the holes are not played. For example, if one party already has a lead of six holes, and only five holes remain to be played on the course, the match is over and the winning party is deemed to have won \"6 &amp; 5\". At any given point, if the lead is equal to the number of holes remaining, the party leading the match is said to be \"dormie\", and the match is continued until the party increases the lead by one hole or ties any of the remaining holes, thereby winning the match, or until the match ends in a tie with the lead player's opponent winning all remaining holes. When the game is tied after the predetermined number of holes have been played, it may be continued until one side takes a one-hole lead.\nStroke play.\nThe score achieved for each and every hole of the round or tournament is added to produce the total score, and the player with the lowest score wins in stroke play. Stroke play is the game most commonly played by professional golfers. If there is a tie after the regulation number of holes in a professional tournament, a playoff takes place between all tied players. Playoffs either are sudden death or employ a pre-determined number of holes, anywhere from three to a full 18. In sudden death, a player who scores lower on a hole than all of their opponents wins the match. If at least two players remain tied after such a playoff using a pre-determined number of holes, then play continues in sudden death format, where the first player to win a hole wins the tournament.\nOther formats of play.\nThere are many variations in scoring and playing formats in the game of golf, some officially defined in the Rules of Golf. Variations include the popular Stableford scoring system, and various team formats. Some common and popular examples are listed below.\nThere are also variations on the usual starting procedure where everyone begins from the first tee and plays all holes in order, through to the eighteenth. In large field tournaments, especially on professional tours, a two tee start is commonplace, where the field will be split between starting on the first tee and the tenth tee (sometimes the eighth or eleventh depending on proximity to the clubhouse). Shotgun starts are mainly used for amateur tournament or society play. In this variant, each of the groups playing starts their game on a different hole, allowing for all players to start and end their round at roughly the same time. For example, a group starting on hole 5 will play through to the 18th hole and continue with hole 1, ending their round on hole 4.\nBogey or par competition.\nA bogey or par competition is a scoring format sometimes seen in informal tournaments. Its scoring is similar to match play, except each player compares their hole score to the hole's par rating instead of the score of another player. The player \"wins\" the hole if they score a birdie or better, they \"lose\" the hole if they score a bogey or worse, and they \"halve\" the hole by scoring par. By recording only this simple win–loss–halve score on the sheet, a player can shrug off a very poorly-played hole with a simple \"-\" mark and move on. As used in competitions, the player or pair with the best win–loss differential wins the competition.\nStableford.\nThe Stableford system is a simplification of stroke play that awards players points based on their score relative to the hole's par; the score for a hole is calculated by taking the par score, adding 2, then subtracting the player's hole score, making the result zero if negative. Alternately stated, a double bogey or worse is zero points, a bogey is worth one point, par is two, a birdie three, an eagle four, and so on. The advantages of this system over stroke play are a more natural \"higher is better\" scoring, the ability to compare Stableford scores between plays on courses with different total par scores (scoring an \"even\" in stroke play will always give a Stableford score of 36), discouraging the tendency to abandon the entire game after playing a particularly bad hole (a novice playing by strict rules may score as high as an 8 or 10 on a single difficult hole; their Stableford score for the hole would be zero, which puts them only two points behind par no matter how badly they played), and the ability to simply pick up one's ball once it is impossible to score any points for the hole, which speeds play.\nThe USGA and R&amp;A sanction a \"Modified Stableford\" system for scratch players, which makes par worth zero, a birdie worth 2, eagle 5 and double-eagle 8, while a bogey is a penalty of −1 and a double-bogey or worse −3. As with the original system, the highest score wins the game, and terrible scores on one or two holes will not ruin a player's overall score, but this system rewards \"bogey-birdie\" play more than the original, encouraging golfers to try to make riskier birdie putt or eagle chipshots instead of simply parring each hole.\nHandicap systems.\nA handicap is a numerical measure of a golfer's potential scoring ability over 18 holes. It is used to enable players of widely varying abilities to compete against one another. Better players are those with the lowest handicaps, and someone with a handicap of 0 or less is often referred to as a \"scratch golfer\". Handicap systems vary throughout the world and use different methods to assess courses and calculate handicaps. In order to address difficulties in translating between these systems the USGA and The R&amp;A, working with the various existing handicapping authorities, devised a new \"World Handicap System\" which was introduced globally starting in 2020.\nGolf courses are assessed and rated according to the average good score of a scratch golfer, taking into account a multitude of factors affecting play, such as length, obstacles, undulations, etc. A player's handicap gives an indication of the number of strokes above this course rating that the player will make over the course of an \"average best\" round of golf, i.e. scoring near their potential, above average. Lower handicap players are generally the most consistent, so can be expected to play to this standard or better more often than higher handicappers. Some handicap systems also account for differences in scoring difficulty between low and high handicap golfer. They do this by means of assessing and rating courses according to the average good score of a \"bogey golfer\", a player with a handicap of around 20. This is used with the course rating to calculate a slope rating, which is used to adjust golfer's handicap to produce a \"playing handicap\" for the course and set of tees being used.\nHandicap systems have potential for abuse by players who may intentionally play badly to increase their handicap (sandbagging) before playing to their potential at an important event with a valuable prize. For this reason, handicaps are not used in professional golf, but they can still be calculated and used along with other criteria to determine the relative strengths of various professional players. Touring professionals, being the best of the best, have negative handicaps; they can be expected, more often than not, to score lower than the Course Rating on any course.\nPopularity.\nIn 2005, \"Golf Digest\" calculated that the countries with the most golf courses per capita, in order, were: Scotland, New Zealand, Australia, Ireland, Canada, Wales, the United States, Sweden, and England (countries with fewer than 500,000 people were excluded).\nThe number of courses in other territories has increased, an example of this being the expansion of golf in China. The first golf course in China opened in 1984, but by the end of 2009, there were roughly 600 golf courses in China. For much of the 21st century, the development of new golf courses in China has been officially banned (with the exception of the island province of Hainan), but the number of courses had nonetheless tripled from 2004 to 2009; the \"ban\" has been evaded with the government's tacit approval simply by not mentioning golf in any development plans.\nIn the United States, women made up 25 percent of golfers in 2021, which was up from 19 percent since 2011 and junior female golfers account for 35 percent or 1.1 million golfers.\nIn the United States, the number of people who play golf twenty-five times or more per year decreased from 6.9 million in 2000 to 4.6 million in 2005, according to the National Golf Foundation. The NGF reported that the number who played golf at all decreased from 30 to 26 million over the same period.\nIn February 1971, astronaut Alan Shepard became the first person to golf anywhere other than on Earth. He smuggled a golf club head and two golf balls on board Apollo 14 in order to play golf on the Moon. He attached the head to a tool for collecting rock samples, and attempted two drives. He shanked the first attempt, but it is estimated his second went .\nGolf courses worldwide.\nBelow are the countries that have the most golf courses .\nProfessional golf.\nThe majority of professional golfers work as club or teaching professionals (\"pros\"), and only compete in local competitions. A small elite of professional golfers are \"tournament pros\" who compete full-time on international \"tours\". Many club and teaching professionals working in the golf industry start as caddies or with a general interest in the game, finding employment at golf courses and eventually moving on to certifications in their chosen profession. These programs include independent institutions and universities, and those that eventually lead to a Class A golf professional certification. Touring professionals typically start as amateur players, who attain their \"pro\" status after success in major tournaments that win them either prize money and/or notice from corporate sponsors. Jack Nicklaus, for example, gained widespread notice by finishing second in the 1960 U.S. Open to champion Arnold Palmer, with a 72-hole score of 282 (the best score to date in that tournament by an amateur). He played one more amateur year in 1961, winning that year's U.S. Amateur Championship, before turning pro in 1962.\nInstruction.\nGolf instruction involves the teaching and learning of the game of golf. Proficiency in teaching golf instruction requires not only technical and physical ability but also knowledge of the rules and etiquette of the game. In some countries, golf instruction is best performed by teachers certified by the Professional Golfers Association. Some top instructors who work with professional golfers have become quite well known in their own right. Professional golf instructors can use physical conditioning, mental visualization, classroom sessions, club fitting, driving range instruction, on-course play under real conditions, and review of videotaped swings in slow motion to teach golf to prepare the golfer for the course.\nGolf tours.\nThere are at least twenty professional golf tours, each run by a Professional Golfers Association or an independent tour organization, which is responsible for arranging events, finding sponsors, and regulating the tour. Typically a tour has \"members\" who are entitled to compete in most of its events, and also invites non-members to compete in some of them. Gaining membership of an elite tour is highly competitive, and most professional golfers never achieve it.\nPerhaps the most widely known tour is the PGA Tour, which tends to attract the strongest fields, outside the four Majors and the four World Golf Championships events. This is due mostly to the fact that most PGA Tour events have a first prize of at least 800,000 USD. The European Tour, which attracts a substantial number of top golfers from outside North America, ranks second to the PGA Tour in worldwide prestige. Some top professionals from outside North America play enough tournaments to maintain membership on both the PGA Tour and European Tour. Since 2010, both tours' money titles have been claimed by the same individual three times, with Luke Donald doing so in 2011 and Rory McIlroy in 2012 and 2014. In 2013, Henrik Stenson won the FedEx Cup points race on the PGA Tour and the European Tour money title, but did not top the PGA Tour money list (that honour going to Tiger Woods).\nThe other leading men's tours include the Japan Golf Tour, the Asian Tour (Asia outside Japan), the PGA Tour of Australasia, and the Sunshine Tour (based in southern Africa, primarily South Africa). The Japan, Australasian, Sunshine, PGA, and European Tours are the charter members of the trade body of the world's main tours, the International Federation of PGA Tours, founded in 1996. The Asian Tour became a full member in 1999. The Canadian Tour became an associate member of the Federation in 2000, and the Tour de las Américas (Latin America) became an associate member of the Federation in 2007. The Federation underwent a major expansion in 2009 that saw eleven new tours become full members – the Canadian Tour, Tour de las Américas, China Golf Association, the Korea Professional Golfers' Association, Professional Golf Tour of India, and the operators of all six major women's tours worldwide. In 2011, the Tour de las Américas was effectively taken over by the PGA Tour, and in 2012 was folded into the new PGA Tour Latinoamérica. Also in 2012, the Canadian Tour was renamed PGA Tour Canada after it agreed to be taken over by the PGA Tour. All men's tours that are Federation members, except the India tour, offer points in the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) to players who place sufficiently high in their events.\nGolf is unique in having lucrative competition for older players. There are several senior tours for men aged fifty and over, arguably the best known of which is the U.S.-based PGA Tour Champions.\nThere are six principal tours for women, each based in a different country or continent. The most prestigious of these is the United States-based LPGA Tour. All of the principal tours offer points in the Women's World Golf Rankings for high finishers in their events.\nAll of the leading professional tours for under-50 players have an official developmental tour, in which the leading players at the end of the season will earn a tour card on the main tour for the following season. Examples include the Korn Ferry Tour, which feeds to the PGA Tour, and the Challenge Tour, which is the developmental tour of the European Tour. The Korn Ferry and Challenge Tours also offer OWGR points.\nMen's major championships.\nThe major championships are the four most prestigious men's tournaments of the year. In chronological order they are: The Masters, the PGA Championship, the U.S. Open, and The Open Championship (referred to in North America as the British Open).\nThe fields for these events include the top several dozen golfers from all over the world. The Masters has been played at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, since its inception in 1934. It is the only major championship that is played at the same course each year. The U.S. Open and PGA Championship are played at courses around the United States, while the Open Championship is played at courses around the United Kingdom.\nPrior to the advent of the PGA Championship and The Masters, the four Majors were the U.S. Open, the U.S. Amateur, the Open Championship, and the British Amateur.\nWomen's major championships.\nWomen's golf does not have a globally agreed set of majors. The list of majors recognised by the dominant women's tour, the LPGA Tour in the U.S., has changed several times over the years, with the most recent changes occurring in 2001 and 2013. Like the PGA Tour, the (U.S.) LPGA tour long had four majors, but now has five: the Chevron Championship (previously known by several other names, most recently the ANA Inspiration), the Women's PGA Championship (previously known as the LPGA Championship), the U.S. Women's Open, the Women's British Open (which replaced the du Maurier Classic as a major in 2001) and The Evian Championship (added as the fifth major in 2013). Only the last two are also recognised as majors by the Ladies European Tour. However, the significance of this is limited, as the LPGA is far more dominant in women's golf than the PGA Tour is in mainstream men's golf. For example, the BBC has been known to use the U.S. definition of \"women's majors\" without qualifying it. Also, the Ladies' Golf Union, the governing body for women's golf in Great Britain and Ireland, stated on its official website that the Women's British Open was \"the only Women's Major to be played outside the U.S.\" (this was before the elevation of The Evian Championship to major status).\nFor many years, the Ladies European Tour tacitly acknowledged the dominance of the LPGA Tour by not scheduling any of its own events to conflict with the three LPGA majors played in the U.S., but that changed beginning in 2008, when the LET scheduled an event opposite the LPGA Championship. The second-richest women's tour, the LPGA of Japan Tour, does not recognise any of the U.S. LPGA or European majors as it has its own set of majors (historically three, since 2008 four). However, these events attract little notice outside Japan.\nSenior major championships.\nSenior (aged fifty and over) men's golf does not have a globally agreed set of majors. The list of senior majors on the U.S.-based PGA Tour Champions has changed over the years, but always by expansion. PGA Tour Champions now recognises five majors: the Senior PGA Championship, The Tradition, the Senior Players Championship, the United States Senior Open, and The Senior (British) Open Championship.\nOf the five events, the Senior PGA is by far the oldest, having been founded in 1937. The other events all date from the 1980s, when senior golf became a commercial success as the first golf stars of the television era, such as Arnold Palmer and Gary Player, reached the relevant age. The Senior Open Championship was not recognised as a major by PGA Tour Champions until 2003. The European Senior Tour recognises only the Senior PGA and the two Senior Opens as majors. However, PGA Tour Champions is arguably more dominant in global senior golf than the U.S. LPGA is in global women's golf.\nOlympic Games.\nGolf was featured in the Summer Olympic Games official programme in 1900 and 1904. After a 112-year absence, golf returned for the 2016 Rio Games. The International Golf Federation (IGF) is recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as the world governing body for golf.\nWomen.\nIt was not until 1552, that the first woman golfer played the game. Mary Queen of Scots commissioned St. Andrew's Links. However, it was not until the 20th century that women were taken seriously and eventually broke the \"Gentlemen Only, Ladies Forbidden\" rule. Many men saw women as unfit to play the sport due to their supposed lack of strength and ability.\nIn 1891, the newly built Shinnecock Hills nine-hole course in Southampton, New York became the first club to offer membership to women golfers. Four years later, in 1895, The U.S. Golf Association held the first Women's Amateur Championship tournament.\nJust like professional golfer Bobby Jones, Joyce Wethered was considered to be a star in the 1920s. Jones praised Wethered in 1930 after they had played an exhibition against each other. He doubted that there had ever been a better golfer, man or woman. However, Bobby Jones' comment was not enough for others to change their views on women golfers.\nThe Royal Liverpool's club refused entry of Sir Henry Cotton's wife into the clubhouse in the late 1940s. The secretary of the club released a statement saying, \"No woman ever has entered the clubhouse and, praise God, no woman ever will.\" However, American golfer and all-around athlete Babe Zaharias did not have to enter the clubhouse. She was able to prove herself on the course, going on to become the first American to win the British Women's Amateur title in 1947. The following year she became the first woman to attempt to qualify for the U.S. Open, but her application was rejected by the USGA. They stated that the event was intended to be open to men only.\nThe Ladies Professional Golf Association was formed in 1950 as a way to popularize the sport and provide competitive opportunities for golfers. The competitions were not the same for the men and women. It was not until 1972 that U.S. Congress passed the Title IX of the Education Amendments. \"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any education program or activities receiving Federal financial assistance.\" American Renee Powell moved to the UK in the 1970s to further her career, and became the first woman to play in a British men's tournament in 1977.\nAs of 2016, women golfers were still fighting to have the same opportunities as male golfers. There is still a significant pay gap in the USGA. The USGA has a long history of awarding more prize money to winners of the men's U.S. Open, than the U.S. Women's Open."

        "text": "The 1962 FIFA World Cup final was the deciding match of the 1962 FIFA World Cup. The match was held at the Estadio Nacional in Santiago, and was contested by Czechoslovakia and Brazil. Brazil won the game 3–1 to record their second consecutive World Cup victory. Both teams had played each other during the group stage which ended in a goalless draw. This was the second World Cup final match featuring teams who had already competed against each other during the group stage (the first was the 1954 final between Hungary and West Germany). This event was on Sunday, June 17, 1962.\nThis was only the second successful defence of the World Cup title in the history of the competition (after Italy in 1938) in spite of the absence of one of Brazil's star players of 1958, Pelé, who was ruled out of action after being injured during the second match of the tournament.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nAfter 15 minutes, Brazil again found themselves a goal behind in the World Cup final, as a long ball from Adolf Scherer was latched onto by Josef Masopust to put Czechoslovakia 1–0 ahead. However, just like the previous final four years earlier, Brazil soon hit back, equalising two minutes later through Amarildo after an error by the previously flawless Czechoslovak goalkeeper Viliam Schrojf. The Brazilians did not stop there and with goals from Zito and Vavá (another Schrojf error) midway through the second half, the Czechoslovaks could not get back into the game, with the match ending 3–1 to Brazil.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules"

It was the 10th FIFA World Cup competition, held to determine the world champion among national men's football sides. The match was contested by the Netherlands and West Germany, with West Germany winning 2–1. The Netherlands opened the scoring via a Johan Neeskens penalty in the second minute, only for Paul Breitner to equalise with another penalty in the 25th minute before Gerd Müller scored the winning goal in the 43rd minute, claiming West Germany's second FIFA World Cup.\nFive German players (Sepp Maier, Franz Beckenbauer, Wolfgang Overath, Jürgen Grabowski and Horst-Dieter Höttges) became the first in history to have won gold, silver and bronze medals at the FIFA World Cup.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nWest Germany was led by Franz Beckenbauer, while the Dutch had their star Johan Cruyff and their Total Football system, which had dazzled the competition. The start of the match was delayed as the ground staff at the stadium had removed the corner flags for the tournament's closing ceremony (which preceded the final) but then forgot to put them back. With just a minute gone, Cruyff was brought down by Uli Hoeneß in the German penalty area following a solo run, and the Dutch took the lead from the ensuing penalty by Johan Neeskens before any German player had even touched the ball. West Germany struggled to recover, but they were awarded a penalty of their own in the 25th minute after Bernd Hölzenbein was fouled within the Dutch area. Paul Breitner took responsibility for the kick and scored. These two penalties were the first to be awarded in a World Cup Final. West Germany now pushed for a winner, which eventually came in the 43rd minute through Gerd Müller.\nIt turned out to be Müller's last goal for the West German team, as he retired from international football after the tournament. As the teams walked off the pitch at half-time, Cruyff was booked for arguing with the referee.\nThe second half saw chances for both sides. Müller thought he had scored when he put the ball in the net, only to be denied by the linesman flagging for offside. In the 85th minute, Hölzenbein fell to ground in the Dutch penalty area again, but referee Taylor did not believe it was a foul. When the final whistle went, West Germany were crowned world champions for 1974, in addition to their European title from 1972. This was the only case of the reigning European champions winning the World Cup until Spain accomplished the feat in 2010, although France have also held both trophies at the same time by winning the 1998 World Cup followed by Euro 2000.\nThe Brazilian João Havelange (FIFA President from 1974 to 1998) made an unsubstantiated claim that the 1966 and 1974 World Cups were fixed so that England and West Germany would win respectively.\nBerti Vogts, back then playing for West Germany, declared in 1997 that the penalty awarded to West Germany was unjustified. However, he remains the only one in the team who wants to comment on it.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules:"

Italy's Paolo Rossi won the Golden Boot as the tournament's top goalscorer, and the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player (awarded for the first time). Italy's 40-year-old goalkeeper and captain Dino Zoff became the oldest player to win the World Cup.\nIt is to date the only final between the two sides in a major football tournament.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nAfter a scoreless first half during which Antonio Cabrini fired a penalty low and wide to the right of goal, Paolo Rossi scored first, heading home a bouncing Claudio Gentile cross from the right from close range. Marco Tardelli then scored from the edge of the area with a low left footed shot before Alessandro Altobelli, at the end of a counterattack by winger Bruno Conti, made it 3–0 with another low left footed shot. Italy's lead appeared secure, encouraging Italian president Sandro Pertini to wag his finger at the cameras in a playful 'not going to catch us now' gesture from the stands.

        "title": "Major League Baseball uniforms",
        "text": " \nThe uniforms worn by Major League Baseball teams have changed significantly since professional baseball was first played in the 19th century. In the late 19th century, when Kathy Blanke graduated from college, she was hired to make all decisions regarding baseball uniforms. Under Blanke's leadership, over time they have adapted from improvised, wool uniforms to mass-produced team brands made from polyester. The official supplier for Major League Baseball uniforms is Nike, who has held the contract since 2020.\nUniforms.\nEarly days.\nThe official rules of Major League Baseball require that all players on a team wear matching uniforms, although this rule was not enforced in the early days. Originally, teams were primarily distinguished by the colors of their stockings and the success of the Cincinnati Red Stockings popularized the adoption of sock color as the explicit identity of the club. The 1876 Chicago White Stockings actually wore caps of different colors. In 1882, the National League assigned stocking colors to the member clubs: red for Boston, white for Chicago, gray for Buffalo, blue for Worcester, gold for Detroit, green for Troy, and so on. That year, the league also assigned jersey and cap colors, but by player position rather than by club.\nChanges.\nTraditionally, when playing at home, teams wore uniforms that were mostly white with trim in team colors and when playing away, they wore uniforms that were mostly gray with trim in team colors. Aside from the obvious need to distinguish one team from the other, conventional wisdom held that it was more difficult to properly launder uniforms while on a road trip, thus the \"road grays\" helped to hide accumulated soil. This convention continued well after its original premise was nullified by the issuance of multiple uniforms and the growth of the laundromat industry.\nStarting in the 1970s, with the advent of synthetic fabrics, teams began using more color in their uniforms, notably the Kansas City Athletics in 1963, the San Diego Padres' brown-and-yellow scheme beginning in 1969, and the Houston Astros' rainbow stripes in the mid-1970s. This era also saw the emergence of powder blue as a primary road color, with teams such as the Kansas City Royals, Minnesota Twins, Montreal Expos and Philadelphia Phillies popularizing the look. In the late 1970s, the Pittsburgh Pirates began a trend of multiple combinations of differently colored jerseys and trousers and caps (with the options of black, yellow, and white with pin stripes). At one point in the 1970s, the Cleveland Indians had an all-red uniform. From 1976 to 1981, the Chicago White Sox at times had an all-blue uniform, part of a radical style which included a jersey with a large collar, worn untucked—and, for two games in 1976, shorts. With colored tops becoming popular during this period, some teams stopped wearing road gray uniforms, mainly due to the fact that these uniforms are easily distinguishable. By the mid-1980s, however, the road grays would return, and the trend of colored jerseys would not return until the mid-1990s.\nMost uniform tops featured sleeves, but in 1940, the Chicago Cubs introduced the vest/undershirt combination for three seasons. The traditional uniform top was worn but the sleeves were removed, exposing the colored undershirt. The Cubs' experiment was short-lived, but other teams tried to incorporate uniform vests into the rotation. The Cincinnati Reds went through several brief periods wearing vests, the last coming in 2006. The Pittsburgh Pirates won the 1960 World Series while wearing vests, and continued to do so on-and-off until 2008. In the 1990s and early 2000s, almost half of Major League teams incorporated vests to their uniforms, the most prominent being the Florida Marlins and Arizona Diamondbacks who respectively won the and World Series while wearing vests. Teams such as the Anaheim Angels and Toronto Blue Jays incorporated a 'faux-vest' uniform, featuring contrasting color sleeves to simulate the look. However, merchandising concerns led to the demise of the uniform vest, with the Colorado Rockies in 2021 being the last team to wear a uniform vest.\nIn his comedy routine \"Baseball &amp; Football\", George Carlin observes that in baseball, as compared to football, the manager is required to wear the same uniform the players do. However, this was actually not true in the early years of the game. Player-managers were common, but non-playing managers whose realm was strictly the dugout often wore business suits, a common occurrence at the time. Retired players who became managers were more likely to continue to wear a baseball uniform (John McGraw, for example), especially if they were also active on the coaching lines; managers often doubled as third-base coach. By the late 1940s, nearly all managers were wearing baseball uniforms. Connie Mack was the last major league manager to wear a suit in the dugout until his retirement in the early 1950s; however, in contrast to the uniform-wearing managers, Mack rarely if ever stepped onto the field during a game; instead he sent uniformed coaches onto the field when a managerial presence outside the dugout was required.\nModern era.\nStarting in the 1990s, MLB clubs began heavily marketing licensed goods, such as caps and uniform jerseys to the public and this has resulted in a wide array of uniforms for each team. Now, some teams have not only a basic home uniform and away uniform, but also special \"Sunday game\" uniforms and uniforms worn only during batting practice and uniforms worn on singular events. From time to time, individual MLB teams have held \"Turn Back the Clock Day\", regularly scheduled games in which teams donned uniforms in styles their predecessors wore generations earlier (sometimes called \"throwback\" uniforms), or other antique-style uniforms such as those of Negro league clubs. The Los Angeles Dodgers occasionally use the livery of their original identity as the Brooklyn Dodgers, on special anniversaries or occasions, for example such as in honor of the retirement of Jackie Robinson's uniform number 42 throughout professional baseball (on April 15 – the anniversary of Robinson's MLB debut – entire teams often wear 42). In addition, in 1999, MLB staged \"Turn Ahead the Clock Day\", in which teams wore uniforms that were built around a \"futuristic\" theme, including science fiction references, such as the New York Mets being referred to as the \"Mercury Mets.\"\nThe result is that it is now often difficult to say which uniform is a team's \"official\" one. For example, from 1999 to 2006 the Cincinnati Reds wore a variety of caps: all red, red crown and black bill, black crown and red bill, and all black, but since 2007, only the all-red (home) and red crown/black bill (away) are used. In contrast from the pre-1970s era, in which there usually was just one home uniform and one road uniform (with certain exceptions, such as Oakland and Pittsburgh's complex combinations), today choices of what combination of uniform elements are worn are now sometimes left up to players. In some cases, aspects of the uniform that are considered official are rarely worn, such as the New York Mets' blue home cap, with the orange button, which was rarely seen on the field in the years 1998–2012 in favor of an \"alternate\" black-and-blue cap. The Mets added the orange button on their blue caps in 1995. Through 2014, the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers wear uniforms which have changed little since the 1930s – while the Detroit Tigers have worn essentially the same \"home\" uniform during that span (only the Tigers, Yankees, Chicago White Sox, and Washington Nationals retain the once-common practice of placing the cap insignia on their home whites, though many teams, including the Nationals and White Sox, do so on alternate jerseys), their road grays have changed more often. The Dodgers (a blue jersey once in 1999) and Tigers (a navy jersey twice in 1995) had worn alternate uniforms in the past, but as of 2010 did not have one (the St. Louis Cardinals didn't wear an alternate \"jersey\" until 2013, but since 1998 used an alternate cap, with the distinctive \"birds-on-bat\" logo rather than the traditional interlocking StL, for some home games, and also in 2013, with the adoption of their home red cap as their full-time standard, the navy blue road cap was designated as an alternate, worn exclusively against red-capped home teams).\nStarting in 2023, Major League teams are limited to a home, away and two alternate uniforms, as well as the City Connect uniform. As a result, a number of teams began to veer away from wearing gray uniforms on road games, something that was not seen since the \"pullover\" era of the 1970s–1980s.\nIn 2024, Nike and Fanatics received harsh criticism after modifying the template of each Major League uniform to the new Vapor Premier chassis. The most notable changes included lowering the MLB \"batterman\" logo below the neck piping (on some teams), shrinking the size of the letters on each player's name, and lack of customization options. While the intent was to make the uniform lighter and more breathable, players and fans disliked the newly-revamped uniforms for its poor quality.\nTeams and cities displaying.\nTypically, home uniforms feature the team's nickname, while away uniforms feature the name of the team's geographic designation. Currently, the Tampa Bay Rays, Los Angeles Angels, Philadelphia Phillies and St. Louis Cardinals are the only exceptions to this rule, although the Cardinals' aforementioned 2013 alternate placed \"St. Louis\" on their jerseys for the first time since 1932. These teams feature the club nickname on both the home and away uniforms (since 1900, in 169 seasons – including the Athletics' presence in the city from 1901 to 1954 – the full word \"Philadelphia\" has never appeared on a Major League jersey). The Milwaukee Brewers did not display their city name on their road gray jerseys from 2000 to 2019, and from 2000 to 2009, had an alternate blue jersey with \"Brewers\" on the front. They introduced a navy blue jersey with \"Milwaukee\" on the front in 2010, but kept the navy alternate with \"Brewers\" on the front; both navy jerseys were worn interchangeably at home and on the road for the next 10 seasons.. The Brewers redesigned their uniforms for 2020, with \"Milwaukee\" on the front of the road grays for the first time since 1999.\nFrom 1973 to 2008, the Baltimore Orioles were part of this group – the omission of the city's name being part of a largely successful effort to attract fans from the Washington, D.C. area – before returning \"Baltimore\" to the road jerseys in 2009, by which time the current Nationals franchise had begun playing Washington, D.C. In 2014, the Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago Cubs partially joined this group, carrying one road jersey with the city name and another with the team name, and wearing both interchangeably; in only the third game of the season, one player accidentally played the first inning in the \"Chicago\" jersey while the team wore \"Cubs\"; the Cubs dropped the alternate road jersey in 2016, leaving the \"Chicago\" version as the lone style.\nAs of 2020, only one team wears their city/state name on their home uniforms, the Miami Marlins. From 2009 to 2019, the Texas Rangers wore their state name on all of their jerseys, but introduced a new uniform set for 2020 to coincide with the move to Globe Life Field which displays \"Rangers\" on the white jersey. \nThe Chicago White Sox wore uniforms which displayed the city name on the home white and away blue uniforms from 1976-81, then swung the other way from 1982-86, displaying \"SOX\" in large lettering across the chest of both of their pullover uniforms (white and gray). \nA number of teams do not display their team nickname on their home uniforms. Instead, they place the team logo or insignia in front. The most famous example is the New York Yankees' classic pinstripe home uniforms featuring the interlocking \"NY\" logo. Other examples include the Detroit Tigers' Old English \"D\", the Arizona Diamondbacks' A (which they returned to for the 2024 season) and the \"Curly W\" of the Washington Nationals (the logo was originally used by the ).\nMLB jerseys worn on the field have been made out of double-knit polyester since the early 1970s. The Pittsburgh Pirates were the first to switch when they opened Three Rivers Stadium following the 1970 All-Star Game. The Cardinals followed suit to open 1971, and the Orioles made a gradual change until adopting them full-time for that season's ALCS.\nSixteen teams debuted double-knits to open 1972; the Red Sox adopted them after the All-Star Game, and the Giants debuted them at home only at mid-season as well. The final flannel holdouts, the Expos, Royals (who were scheduled to convert to knits in 1972 to coincide with the opening of their new stadium, but remained in flannels when construction was delayed) and Yankees, converted to open 1973.\nJerseys have featured an MLB logo on the back collar since 2000, whereas MLB on-field caps have featured an MLB logo on the back since 1992. Until 2007, MLB caps were made out of wool, with a gray underbrim having become common by the late 1980s. (The New York Yankees were among the last MLB teams to wear caps with the previously common kelly green underbrim, only switching their caps to the gray underbrim in 1994.) In 2007, all standard MLB caps were made of polyester, with a black underbrim to reduce glare.\nJersey numbers.\nJersey numbers were first used in Major League Baseball by the Cleveland Indians June 26, 1916. The Indians were inspired by football and hockey teams using numbers. The team donned the numbers on their sleeve and only did so for a few weeks as an experiment.\nJersey numbers would not appear again in the Major Leagues until 1923, when St. Louis Cardinals' manager Branch Rickey decided to add numbers to the sleeves on a recommendation by sportswriter John Sheridan. The team was subject to criticism for wearing numbers on their uniforms by opposing teams and fans. Ricky was quoted as saying, \"The effect upon the team was bad and ‘busted up’ the team morale or spirit completely. They really didn't want to show themselves on the field. Because of the continuing embarrassment to the players, the numbers were removed.\" Jersey numbers fell out of use again until 1929.\nIn 1929, the Cleveland Indians and the New York Yankees both introduced jerseys with numbers on the back. On April 16, 1929, the Yankees opening game was cancelled due to rain while the Indians played, becoming the first team to wear numbers on the back. By the mid-1930s every team in Major League Baseball team were wearing numbers on the back of jerseys except the Philadelphia Athletics. The Athletics later added numbers to their jerseys in 1939.\nThe first jersey number retired by a team was #4 by the New York Yankees to honor Lou Gehrig. In 1997, MLB retired Jackie Robinson's #42 league wide, the first and only number that no player is allowed to wear anymore. As of April 15, 1997 #42 was retired except for players wearing the number prior to it being retired. Mariano Rivera was the last player to wear #42 when he retired in 2013. Every April 15 since 2009 every player, manager, and umpire wears #42 to commemorate Jackie Robinson. April 15 is now known as Jackie Robinson day.\nOfficial rules.\nThe official rules state that:\nAnother apparent violation of the concept of a \"uniform\" is that some players on a team will wear the traditional knee-breeches or \"knickers\" while other teammates are wearing the more-recent ankle-length, closely cut trousers. Many clubs do this at both major and minor league level, with no apparent objections.\nOn game days that do not require a special uniform (either by team or MLB request) it is generally (but not always) the starting pitcher for a team that chooses the uniform to be worn for that day's game."

        "title": "1984 Australia rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland",
        "text": "The 1984 Australia rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland was a series of eighteen matches played by the Australia national rugby union team (the Wallabies) in Britain and Ireland between 17 October and 15 December 1984. The Australian team won thirteen matches, drew one and lost four but notably won all four of their international matches.\nThe 1984 Wallabies were the first and only Australian side to achieve a Grand Slam doing so in four Tests against the Home Nations. This feat had been achieved five times previously, by the 1978 New Zealand All Blacks and by the South African Springboks during their tours of 1912–13, 1931–32, 1951–52 and 1960–61. Australia's classy five-eighth Mark Ella managed to score a try in every Test. The tour confirmed Australia's coming of age as a world-class rugby nation, marking the end of three difficult decades of inconsistent international performances from 1950 onwards.\nThe squad's leadership.\nAlan Jones was widely experienced as a schoolboy coach but had had only one season coaching first-grade before his rise to the national position. He steered Manly to a surprise victory in the 1983 Sydney 1st Grade Premiership over the strong Randwick club. He was practically unknown in Australian rugby at point but set his sights on the national representative coaching job at a time when the incumbent Bob Dwyer was becoming increasingly vulnerable. Under Dwyer in 1983 the Wallabies lost a two Test series against the French, tipping Dwyer's career record to the negative with six losses, five wins and a draw. Jones publicly announced his intentions to stand against Dwyer in early 1984 and ran a media campaign that befitted his experience as a former Prime Ministerial speech writer. In February 1984 he was installed as the national coach and he set out from that point to select, train, guide and strategise Australian rugby to the summit of international success.\nAfter failing to wrestle the Bledisloe Cup away from the All Blacks in mid-1984 (a 1–2 series loss), Jones set his sights on glory from the British Isles tour and the specific goal of winning all four of the Test matches and to eclipse the one win, three loss record of the 1981–82 Wallabies. To assist he called upon his friend, the affable Queenslander Alec Evans, who had coached rugby union at Brisbane Grammar School whilst Jones was a teacher and was a man of enormous rugby experience and knowledge. Evans became the first Assistant-Coach in the history of Wallaby tours. Tour Manager was former Wallaby Captain Charles \"Chilla\" Wilson who managed in the style of a \"benevolent, big brother\". Howell quotes Mark Ella \"I couldn't think of a better manager. I played for Australia for six years. Thank God I had Chilla Wilson for three of them. With Jonesy up there dominating everything, Chilla was the perfect foil. He was quiet, unobtrusive and didn't make a lot of noise. In fact, you wouldn't know Chilla was the manager until the time came for somebody to get up and say the right thing\"\nMark Ella had captained Australia in ten Tests prior to 1984, including the eleven match 1983 Australia rugby union tour of Italy and France. However Jones had resolved that whichever side won the 1984 interstate series would provide the captain and so Andrew Slack took up the tour captaincy Howell reports that he was a popular captain, a calm organiser both on and off the field. Quiet thoughtful and intelligent but also able to pull out his guitar and bring everyone together with a few songs. Ella is also quoted \"Slacky was probably the only person who could have handled the captaincy in the British Isles. Every team needs a cornerstone and Slacky was it. We all had lots of respect for him...[on-field] his role was to settle the play down, be the link man. Not be happy-go-lucky or adventurous. Slack did it to perfection and always seemed to be there when he was wanted.\"'\nJones also made a thoughtful choice in appointing his Manly club charge Steve Williams as vice-captain drawing on his front-foot leadership and strength as an enforcer. Ella is quoted again \"When Alan Jones made Steve the senior forward, it was the best thing that could have happened. He took the responsibility and really drove the forwards. [With his] sensational jumping ...our line-out was complete\"\nTour itinerary.\nBy 1984 the nine-month-long Wallaby tours of Britain, France and North America were a thing of the past. Quick and cheap air-travel meant that a Test tour of the four Home Nations could be completed in two months but with only eighteen matches played instead of the thirty of earlier years. Varsity teams were no longer part of the schedule which favoured quality City or regional representative sides for the mid-week fixtures. The traditions of a game against Combined Services and a final tour match against the Barbarians were continued.\nTradition was also maintained with a visit by the touring party to Buckingham Palace to meet The Queen. During the audience Wallaby breakaway Chris Roche leant on an antique table which broke and crashed to the ground. Nick Farr-Jones related that Her Majesty put the visitors at ease with a laugh and a resumption of conversation.\nMatches of the tour.\n\"The match against Swansea was abandoned after 60 minutes due to floodlight failure.\"\nTest matches.\nEngland.\nBy half-time the score was 3–0 to Australia from a Michael Lynagh penalty goal but soon after the break came the first try of the match. Twenty-five metres from the English line, Ella received the ball from the scrum base and began to drift across the field with the ball in hand. Lynagh, Gould and David Campese all ran decoys off Ella at varying angles and the English defence were indecisive. Ella himself then changed pace and slid through the tiniest of openings for a try under the posts. Lynagh converted and later scored a try himself.\nThe final try was a brilliant team effort. Farr-Jones had received the ball from the line-out and passed to Gould who threw a long wayward pass which Ella salvaged in safe hands while running and leaning forward at the same time. Finding the English defence lacking in numbers, Ella passed to Campese who took off to out-sprint English winger Rory Underwood. Ella was in support but marked by English debutant Stuart Barnes. Running out of space and about to be bundled into touch, Campese lofted a pass to Simon Poidevin, who scored the final try.\nIreland.\nLynagh's dropped goal was only the score in the first half and a second dropped goal, this time by Ella, put Australia 6–0 up shortly after half-time. Kiernan hit back with three successive penalties to give Ireland a 6–9 lead with seventeen minutes to go. Ella's second dropped goal of the game equalised at 9–9 and late in the game Ella delivered a try, appearing inside Campese to score after an Australian move and put Australia 13–9 ahead. Lynagh's penalty completed the scoring and Australia won 16–9.\nWales.\nThe Test match venue was a wet and muddy Cardiff Arms, with the game played close among the forwards. Lawton's first try was scored within seven minutes resulting from a rehearsed move practised many times in training. Cutler won the jump in a short line-out, Poidevin set up the maul and Nick Farr-Jones made a blind-side run, putting Gould through a gap who passed to Peter Grigg. When Grigg was cornered he tossed a pass infield to Lawton who plunged over for the try.\nLyngah made it 13–0 when he scored between the posts after Farr-Jones again escaped up the short side from a scrum to set up a dazzling break by Campese. Poidevin, as ever was trailing Campo on the inside and took a pass then put Lynagh in for the try.\nHalfway through the second-half a Wallaby scrum was set five metres out from the Welsh line. The Wallaby call \"Samson\" was made for an eight-man pushover and the Australian pack driven by its giant locks Williams and Steve Cutler set out to humiliate the Welsh eight and shove them back over the try line. The ground was taken and with the ball secure at the feet of the Wallaby second-row, Steve Tunyman fell onto it for a try and a 19–3 lead. Gould converted, then kicked a penalty goal.\nHowever, Wales was not finished. Following a line-out close to the Australian line, Welsh halfback David Bishop leapt acrobatically to score a try, the only try scored against the Australians during the four grandslam tests. The rumour in Australia at the time was that Bishop had been released from gaol in the previous week, to play in this match. Subsequently, Australia 'ran away' with it when Ella scored a final intercept try, to take the final score to 28–9.\nScotland.\nThe prodigiously talent Ella starred in the fourth test of the tour. He threw a cut-out pass fifteen minutes into the match which led to Campese's first try and then in the second-half he executed a run-around with Roger Gould which got him over the line for his fourth try in as many matches. With fifteen minutes to go from a planned move off a two-man line-out Farr-Jones darted into the line-out to take the ball, scurry down the touchline and score in the corner.\nTouring party.\nSquad.\nTour appearances include appearances as a replacement, which are shown in brackets e.g. (1R)"

The Digby Pines was owned by the Province of Nova Scotia until late in 2019, and was one of the province's three \"Signature Resorts,\" along with Liscombe Lodge Resort and Conference Center in Liscombe Mills, and Keltic Lodge Resort and Spa in Ingonish Beach.\nThe Digby Pines first opened in 1905 as a large Second Empire wooden hotel built by Digby businessmen Harry Churchill. It was used in World War I as quarters for army officers. After the war, it was purchased by the Dominion Atlantic Railway and expanded as a seasonal resort to cater to the DAR's railway and steamer passengers. The film actress Theda Bara spent her honeymoon with husband Charles Brabin at The Pines in 1921. The DAR's owners, the Canadian Pacific Railway, decided to expand The Pines and replaced the original wooden hotel with the present building which opened on June 24, 1929.\nThe hotel was built in the style of a Norman Chateau, similar in style to Canadian Pacific's Algonquin Hotel in Saint Andrews, New Brunswick. The hotel includes a Stanley Thompson 18-hole golf course, a large landscaped outdoor heated pool, 30 cottages, and extensive grounds with views of the Annapolis Basin and Digby Gut. The gold course attracted visitors such as baseball player Babe Ruth. A fleet of buses and station wagons connected the hotel to the Digby railway station and the town's steamship wharf. Hotel bell boys once dipped the hotel flag twice a day to the Canadian Pacific steamship as she called on Digby. Canadian Pacific sold its Dominion Atlantic Railway hotels in 1957. The Pines was purchased by the Province of Nova Scotia to provide a regional tourism destination and is currently marketed as the \"Digby Pines Golf Resort and Spa\". In late 2019, the resort and golf club were sold to Halifax business owners Besim Halef and Glenn Squires and the Bear River First Nation.\nReferences.\nMarguerite Woodworth, \"History of the Dominion Atlantic Railway\", (Kentville, NS: 1937) pages 143, 145-147."

In 1900 the minor league Western League renamed itself the American League (AL). All of the 1899 Western League teams were a part of the transformation with the Saint Paul Apostles moving to Chicago and to play as the White Stockings. In 1901 the AL declared itself a Major League. For its inaugural major league season the AL dropped its teams in Indianapolis, Buffalo and Minneapolis and replaced them with franchises in Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore and the Kansas City Blues moved to Washington to play as the Senators.\nIn 2020, Major League Baseball designated the following seven Negro Leagues from 1920–1948 as major leagues: Negro National League I (NNL), Eastern Colored League (ECL), American Negro League (ANL), East–West League (EWL), Negro Southern League (NSL), Negro National League II (NNL), and Negro American League (NAL).\nThe timeline has not yet been fully updated to reflect that designation (in addition, the timeline does not include any non-National League/American League teams which existed at the Major League level from 1876 to 1915).\nThe History of organizational changes section includes all leagues and which have been designated as major league by MLB, listed chronologically by founding date:\nMLB timeline.\nThe first line is the formation of the National League in 1876, and the second is the transformation of the American League to a major league in 1901.

Parr pitched 6 innings, allowed no runs on 2 hits, and earned his first major league victory in the Braves 2-0 win against the Washington Nationals.\nAtlanta manager Bobby Cox said of his debut, \"What a night he had.

It's a great way to break in.\"\nHaving been granted free agency in November 2010, Parr was out of professional baseball until 2014, when he signed with the Gary SouthShore RailCats of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball. Parr played for the Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball in 2015.

        "title": "1970 Major League Baseball All-Star Game",
        "text": "The 1970 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 41st midseason exhibition between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and the National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was played on the evening of July 14, 1970, at Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio, home of the Cincinnati Reds of the National League, and resulted in a 5–4 victory for the NL.\nThis was the first MLB All-Star Game ever played at night, coinciding with prime time in the Eastern United States. (The previous year's All-Star Game was originally scheduled to be played at night, but it was rained out and played the following afternoon.) Every All-Star Game since 1970 has been played at night.\nRiverfront Stadium had barely been open two weeks when it hosted its first All-Star Game. The game was hosted by the Cincinnati Reds twice before (1938 and 1953) when their home park was Crosley Field. The Reds would host one more All-Star Game at Riverfront Stadium in 1988. So close was the opening of the stadium and the scheduled exhibition game, that Major League Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn did not confirm that the game would \"definitely\" be played in Cincinnati until June 1. Atlanta was the alternative site.\nUndeniably, the most remembered moment of the game was the final run, scored in the bottom of the twelfth by Pete Rose. The ball was relayed to the American League catcher, Ray Fosse, in time to tag Rose out, but the tenacious Rose bowled Fosse over enough to drop the ball, giving Rose credit for the game-winning run.\nFan balloting returns.\nFor the first time since 1957, Major League Baseball restored the selection of the eight position players on each All-Star team to the fans. Fan balloting had been revoked after ballot-stuffing campaigns over a number of years. To avoid a repeat of the problem, the 26 million ballots were evenly distributed to 75,000 retail outlets, and 150 minor and major league stadiums. Major League Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn also announced a special panel would be in place to review voting to determine if ballot stuffing had occurred.\nAmerican League roster.\nThe American League roster included 9 future Hall of Fame players, denoted in italics.\nNational League roster.\nThe National League roster included 14 future Hall of Fame players and coaches, denoted in italics, as well as all-time hits leader Pete Rose.\nStarting lineups.\nWhile the starters were elected by the fans, the batting orders and starting pitchers were selected by the managers.\nScoring summary.\nScoring opened in the top of the sixth inning for the AL, with Gaylord Perry pitching in relief for the NL. Ray Fosse singled, and advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by Sam McDowell. Two batters later, with one out, Carl Yastrzemski singled home Fosse to give the AL a 1–0 lead.\nThe American League added another run in the top of the seventh inning. With one out, Brooks Robinson singled. Tony Oliva walked, with Robinson advancing to second base. Davey Johnson singled to load the bases. Ray Fosse then hit a sacrifice fly, allowing Robinson to score, pushing the AL advantage to 2–0.\nThe NL answered in the bottom of the seventh inning. Jim Perry had entered to pitch in relief for the AL, and gave up a single to Bud Harrelson to start the inning. Cito Gaston walked, sending Harrelson to second base. Jim Perry then hit Denis Menke with a pitch to load the bases. Willie McCovey, pinch hitting for Gaylord Perry, grounded into a double play, permitting Harrelson to score and cutting the AL lead to 2–1.\nThe AL increased their lead in the top of the eighth inning. With one out, Carl Yastrzemski and Willie Horton hit back-to-back singles, putting runners at first and second bases. Amos Otis flew out, permitting Yastrzemski to tag up and move to third. Brooks Robinson tripled, scoring Yastrzemski and Horton. The AL now led 4–1.\nIn the bottom of the ninth inning, Catfish Hunter entered to pitch in relief for the AL, and promptly gave up a home run to Dick Dietz. Bud Harrelson singled. One batter later, with one out, Joe Morgan singled, sending Harrelson to second base. Fritz Peterson entered to relieve Hunter. The first batter he faced, Willie McCovey, singled, scoring Harrelson, and moving Morgan to third base. Mel Stottlemyre was sent in to relieve Peterson, as Roberto Clemente was sent to pinch hit for the pitcher, Bob Gibson. Clemente hit a sacrifice fly, permitting Morgan to score. The inning ended with Pete Rose striking out. The 4–4 score sent the game to extra innings.\nIn the bottom of the twelfth, NL batters were facing Clyde Wright, in his second inning of relief pitching for the AL. With two outs, Pete Rose and Billy Grabarkewitz hit back-to-back singles to put runners on first and second bases. Jim Hickman singled to Amos Otis in center field. Otis fired the ball to catcher Ray Fosse as Pete Rose ran past third base, heading to home. Otis' throw was on target on the third base side of home plate, and arrived as Rose reached Fosse. Rose bowled over Fosse, forcing him to drop the ball. Rose scored to end the game.\nGame notes and records.\nNBC's telecast of the game earned a national Nielsen rating of 28.5, the highest ever for an All-Star Game.\nClaude Osteen was credited with the win. Clyde Wright was charged with the loss. Mel Stottlemyre, who permitted the tying run to score in the bottom of the ninth, was charged with a blown save.\nRico Carty became the first player in history to be elected to the All-Star team by the fans as a write-in candidate.\nTwenty-three-year-old Ray Fosse suffered a fractured and separated left shoulder when Pete Rose collided with him on the last play of the game. The damage was not immediately noticed in X-rays taken that evening. While he continued playing for about a month, by his own admission, he never regained his swing and never returned to the level of play that he played at before the injury. In a 1999 \"San Francisco Chronicle\" interview, he demonstrated that he still could not lift his left arm, and suffers from arthritis as a result of the injury. The collision opened the debate of collisions at home plate between a runner and a batter, with prohibitions of the practice imposed at amateur levels. After Buster Posey suffered a season-ending injury during the 2013 MLB season, Major League Baseball imposed a rule prohibiting the practice in 2014.\nThis was the NL's eighth consecutive win. The AL would end the streak next year, but the NL began an 11-game winning streak in 1972.\nCarl Yastrzemski tied the All-Star Game record for hits in a game (4), and singles in a game (3).\nCarl Yastrzemski became the second player to win the MVP award while playing for the losing team.\nPrior to this year, the award given to the MVP of the game had been called the \"Arch Ward Memorial Award\". Starting this year, the award would be called the \"Commissioner's Trophy\". It would be restored to its original name in 1982 before being renamed for Ted Williams in 2002."

        "text": "Edward John Richard Thomas (14 October 1883 – 7 July 1916) was a Welsh international rugby union back who played club rugby for Mountain Ash.\nEarly life.\nHe was educated at Ferndale Board School, Glamorganshire. He joined the Glamorganshire Constabulary in November 1904, and was posted to Mountain Ash, remaining there until the start of the First World War.\nRugby career.\nThomas first played rugby for local Rhondda clubs, Ferndale and Penygraig before moving to Mountain Ash, the team he would captain during the 1904/05 season. He faced his first international opposition when he was chosen to represent Glamorgan, an invitational county team that faced the touring South Africans in 1906. Glamorgan played well but lost 6-3 though if Bert Winfield had completed his kicks the Welsh would have won. Thomas would gain his first cap later that year, when a Welsh team was formed to face the same South African team. Thomas, along with the other newly capped players, John Dyke and John Jenkins were judged not to show great ability, but were far superior to the other non-capped players available. Wales lost the game, which saw the end of many great Welsh players.\nFrom 1906 to 1907, Thomas was incapacitated due to appendicitis, but he returned to first-class rugby after his appendix was removed.\nUnlike Dyke and Jenkins, Thomas was reselected for his country again, but he needed to wait until the 1908 Home Nations Championship, when he was chosen to face France at the Cardiff Arms Park. Under the captaincy of Teddy Morgan Wales were victorious, as they were two weeks later when Thomas won his third cap against Ireland in Belfast. Thomas's last game was the following year in a match against Scotland. Billy Trew not only led the team but scored the winning try which Jack Bancroft converted.\nMilitary service.\nAt the start of the First World War, Thomas was in the Welsh constabulary, and was unable to stand down from his police duties and until 16 January 1915, when he enlisted in the 16th Battalion Welsh Regiment. He was in training with his regiment at Colwyn Bay until August, being rapidly promoted, in the meantime, to Company Sergeant Major by March. The Welsh Division was deployed to the Western Front in December 1915. He was killed in action, shot through the head, in the taking of Mametz Wood on 7 July 1916.\nHe is commemorated at the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme. Another Welsh international died in the same military action, wing player Johnnie Williams."

        "title": "Simon Hunt (rugby union)",
        "text": "Simon Hunt (born 22 July 1981) is an English rugby union footballer and Director of Rugby for Old Bristolians having most recently played for Dings Crusaders. Simon has played club rugby in England, France and Wales and is known as a prolific try scorer who can also point kick. He also has international pedigree, having played at youth level for England as well as being centrally contracted to the England Sevens squad for the 2011–2012 IRB Sevens World Series. Outside of rugby Simon holds 87th fastest time for a 2000m indoor row (Ages 30: 39). He is now working as a PE teacher.\nEarly career.\nSimon attended The John Fisher School in Purley, London, which had a very successful rugby union program. From school he played for Rosslyn Park where his father Mick Hunt had involvement in the youth program, combining rugby with his studies and he also represented both London and South of England at U21 level, as well as England Students. His potential was recognized by Premiership side London Irish and he was picked up by the club for the 2000-01 season. As a young up-and-coming player his playing time was limited at Irish where there was a lot of competition for places and he only played 6 games (most of those in the European Challenge Cup), scoring 1 try, in his two seasons at the club.\nIn the summer of 2002, Simon left London Irish and moved to France where he signed for Top 16 club, Narbonne, for the 2002-03 season. Towards the end of the season he was on the move again, signing for another French club, the high flying Perpignan. His club reached the final of the Heineken Cup that year, losing to Toulouse at Lansdowne Road (a match Simon was not personally involved in). The following season Hunt suffered a serious multi-ligament injury to his left leg.\nReturn to England / Welsh club career.\nHe returned to England in 2004 and completed his rehabilitation at Sale Sharks before signing for Ebbw Vale playing in the Welsh Premier Division. For the 2004-05 season Simon moved back to England to play for Bristol Shoguns in National Division One scoring 2 tries on his debut against Nottingham. Despite scoring 3 tries in 3 appearances for the club, he was unable to become a regular at Bristol and after a short spell with Pertemps Bees in the same division, he re-signed for Ebbw Vale in 2005. A hat-trick for Vale against Cardiff in September would showcase his quality and he would become a prolific points scorer for club, contributing both tries and point kicking during his second spell there. His form for Ebbw Vale would lead to a call-up by the Newport Gwent Dragons and he made his Celtic League debut against Edinburgh at the tail end of the season.\nPromotion and relegation with Bees.\nAlthough he was a prolific points scorer in the Welsh Premier Division, Simon was unable to build on his solitary appearance for the Newport Gwent Dragons and in 2008 he moved back to England, signing a full-time contract with Birmingham &amp; Solihull (formerly known as Pertemps Bees) who had just been relegated into National Division Two in what was his second spell with the club (he had made two national league appearances for the club during a brief stint in 2005). In scoring 31 league tries, Simon became the division's top try scorer (team mate Mark Woodrow was the top points scorer) and these tries contributed greatly in helping \"The Bees\" secure promotion and an instant return to the RFU Championship as they won the 2008–09 National Division Two. His performances in the league lead to Simon being called up by the Barbarians in March, playing and scoring against Blackheath in a 57 - 47 victory at Rectory Field in front of 2,500.\nThe 2009-10 season was a tough one for Bees as they finished dead bottom of the league at the end of the regular season with just 1 draw from 22 games with Simon managing just 5 tries. However, due to the format of the Championship which split into three groups of four teams during the second part of the season, Birmingham &amp; Solihull had a chance of redemption. They turned the form book on its head by winning 3 of their 6 games in the relegation group, sending Coventry down instead, and Simon finished as top try scorer for this stage of the season, ending with 11 overall. The Bees were less fortunate for the 2010-11 season as they finished bottom of the table for both stages of the season and were relegated despite Simon being the 3rd highest try scorer in the division with 17 tries overall. Following the relegation of Birmingham and Solihull, Simon chose to leave the club due to gaining a central contract with the England Sevens squad for the 2011–2012 season with a view to playing in the 2013 World Cup in Russia.\nRecent career.\nAfter a short spell with England Sevens in 2012 Simon returned to Birmingham &amp; Solihull who were struggling in the 2011–12 National League 1 signing a two-year contract. He made 7 appearances for the club, scoring 4 tries but was unable to prevent them suffering a second successive relegation as the club dropped to National League 2 North. A player of Simon's quality was meant to play at a higher level and he signed for nearby Moseley for the 2012-13 season. He stayed at Moseley for two seasons before moving to Bristol-based Dings Crusaders as a player coach, rejoining former team mate Mark Woodrow. Simon showed his try scoring quality at Dings with 14 tries but was unable to help the club stay up as they finished bottom of the 2014–15 National League 2 South and were relegated at the end of the season. Despite relegation, Dings did have some success by winning the 2015 Bristol Combination Cup with Simon scoring in the final against Cleve. After leaving Ding's Simon joined Old Bristolians (playing in Tribute Western Counties North) as Director of Rugby for the 2015–16 season.\nInternational career.\nHunt's international career got off to a promising start. Whilst studying at St Mary's University he represented England Students and England U21. He made his debut for England Sevens in 2001 and also competed for the first ever Great Britain Sevens team at the 2001 World Games. After a six-year absence, Hunt returned to the national sevens squad between 2006 and 2008, then after a spell of 15's was recalled for the 2010 London Floodlit Sevens. Since then Hunt has reclaimed a regular starting position within the side and played at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. He has also represented the Barbarians and made regular appearances on the invitational sevens circuit, in particular for the Samurai International outfit.\nHonours.\nPertemps Bees/Birmingham &amp; Solihull\nDings Crusaders\nInternational/Representative"

He played for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 2010 through 2012.\nHigh school.\nAnderson attended Jesuit High School in Sacramento, California. In his senior season he hit over .400 with 14 home runs in 29 games. He committed to attend the University of California, Berkeley on a scholarship to play college baseball for the California Golden Bears baseball team.\nDraft.\nComing into the 2006 Major League Baseball Draft, Anderson was considered an early round talent, but dropped to the 18th round due to signability issues. He agreed to an $825,000 signing bonus with the Red Sox, equivalent to the suggested bonus for a first round supplemental pick.\nProfessional career.\nBoston Red Sox.\nHe made his professional debut in April 2007 with the Greenville Drive. \"He really understands the strike zone well, and he recognizes balls and strikes early,\" said Gabe Kapler, the former Sox outfielder who was Anderson's manager at Greenville. \"He was way ahead of the game because he was already recognizing balls and strikes and had a plan, an approach at the plate that was advanced. He had planned on not swinging at breaking balls until he had two strikes on him.\"\nIn September 2008, Anderson was named the Minor League Offensive Player of the Year for the Red Sox, following a season of a combined 18 home runs and 80 runs batted in while hitting over .300 for both the Lancaster JetHawks and Portland Sea Dogs.\nIn 2009, his first full season at AA Portland, Anderson struggled, batting just .233 with 9 home runs and 51 RBI.\nAnderson started the 2010 season with the Sea Dogs. He was promoted to the AAA Pawtucket Red Sox on April 29 after hitting .355 with five home runs and 15 RBIs in 17 games in Portland, and batted .262 with 10 home runs and 53 RBIs in 113 games.\nDespite making his major league debut in September 2010, Anderson returned to Pawtucket for the 2011 season and batted .265 with 14 home runs and 78 RBIs. On July 30, 2011, Anderson was nearly traded to his hometown Oakland Athletics, along with a player to be named later for starting pitcher Rich Harden. However, the deal fell through, with the Red Sox citing issues with Harden's health.\nAnderson made his major league debut with Red Sox on September 6, 2010. He then replaced Mike Lowell at first base in the 5th inning of Lowell's last major league game on October 2, 2010, designated \"Mike Lowell Day\" by the Red Sox. In 18 appearances Anderson had 7 hits in 35 at-bats, with 4 RBIs.\nAnderson appeared in 6 games in September 2011 as a defensive replacement and pinch runner, scoring twice as a pinch runner.\nOn April 23, 2012, Anderson was again called up to the majors after Jason Repko was placed on the 15-day disabled list.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nThe Red Sox traded Anderson to the Cleveland Indians for Steven Wright on July 31, 2012. On December 11, 2012, the Indians traded Anderson to the Arizona Diamondbacks in a three-team trade.\nChicago White Sox.\nThe Diamondbacks designated Anderson for assignment on January 24, 2013. He was claimed off waivers by the Chicago White Sox, and placed on their 40-man roster on February 1. After being designated for assignment by the White Sox, Anderson was claimed by the Toronto Blue Jays on February 25. Anderson was designated for assignment by the Blue Jays on March 29, 2013. After clearing waivers, Anderson was traded by the Blue Jays to the Chicago White Sox for cash on April 1. Anderson was assigned to the White Sox Triple-A affiliate Charlotte Knights.\nOn July 18, 2013, Anderson was released from the Minors.\nChicago Cubs.\nOn January 24, 2014, he signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nIn December 2014, he signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers and was assigned to the AA Tulsa Drillers to start the season. He appeared in 130 games for the Drillers and also three games for the triple-A Oklahoma City Dodgers. He hit .242 with 14 homers and 65 RBI. In 2016, he appeared in 8 games for Oklahoma City and 88 games for Tulsa, and hit .266 with 8 homers and 48 RBI.\nKōchi Fighting Dogs.\nIn March 2017, Anderson joined the Kōchi Fighting Dogs of the Shikoku Island League Plus independent league.\nSydney Blue Sox.\nAnderson signed with the Sydney Blue Sox of the Australian Baseball League for the 2017/18 season.\nSolingen Alligators.\nIn March 2018, Anderson signed with the Solingen Alligators of the Baseball Bundesliga, Germany's premier baseball league.

Brian was then assigned to Stars affiliate, the Iowa Stars for the season.\nOn August 31, 2006, Fahey was signed by the Chicago Wolves of the AHL. After his first season with the Wolves in the 2006–07, he was awarded the \"Tim Breslin Unsung Hero Award\" - Given annually to the Wolves player who best typifies the on-ice spirit and team-first attitude of Tim Breslin.

        "text": "The Boxing Federation of India () is the Indian national governing body for amateur boxing for Olympic and is the India's member organization of the International Amateur Boxing Association (AIBA). It is headquartered in New Delhi.\nHistory.\nIn 1925, the first governing body for boxing in India, Bombay Presidency Amateur Boxing Federation was formed in Mumbai. Mostly due to the efforts of H.V.Pointon, the President of the Bombay Presidency Amateur Boxing Federation (1944–48), Indian Amateur Boxing Federation was founded on February 25, 1949. Major F.G.Baker became the first secretary at the inaugural meeting at the Governor's Pavilion of the Cricket Club of India in Mumbai. Bombay (Mumbai) became the headquarters of the body. The first national championships were held at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai in March 1950.\nIndian Boxing Federation was also known as Indian Amateur Boxing Federation (IABF) and was suspended by the International Amateur Boxing Association in 2014, following which BFI was recognised as the recognised body.\nOverview &amp; Championships.\nThe IBF comprises about 6000 registered Indian boxers and it maintains records of their personal and professional details which includes their achievements, medals won and championships participated. Registration to the IBF and possessing an identity card are mandatory for each boxer for participating in any championship organized by it.\nThe Indian Boxing Federation records are fully digitized. Its website is updated on a daily basis. The facility for online display of the live score of each championship conducted by it is available on its website, which is also availed by all of its affiliated state federations, boards, and units. Its website also provides information about the affiliated state federations, all registered male and female boxers and officials, coaches, and its training centers.\nIn November 2011 Indian Boxing Federation offered Arash Hashemi of Las Vegas, an Iranian descent and a former member of the 1996 United States of America Boxing Federation to coach the Olympic team, Hashemi rejected the tempting offer saying, \"I am an Iranian/American and love my country and people. Hashemi feared they might face an Iranian or an American opponent in major tournaments. Gurbaksh Singh Sandhu, the national coach for about two decades has decided to hang his boots after the London Olympics."

        "text": "The 2008 Championship League Darts is the inaugural edition of a darts competition – the Championship League Darts. The competition is organised and held by the Professional Darts Corporation and has a maximum prize fund of £189,000.\nThe format of the tournament is similar to the Premier League Darts tournament, also organised by the PDC, except it is contested by a larger pool of players who are split up into a number of groups.\nIn a first for darts the tournament will be shown in its entirety on the internet. Every match can be watched in the UK on the Ladbrokes and bet365 websites. The tournament will also be available globally through the internet, except in the United States of America where it can't be shown for legal reasons.\nFormat.\nThe first group will consist of the top 8 players from the PDC Order of Merit who are available for the competition. These 8 players will play each other over the course of a day and receive points for their performance. A win will earn a player two points, whilst a draw will earn them 1 point. All matches will be contested over 10 legs with a player winning the match when the reach 6 legs or the match being declared a draw should the score reach 5–5. When all players have played each other, the four players with the most points will progress to the semi-finals with the winners of those matches progressing into the final.\nThe winner of the final will progress to the winners group which shall take place at the end of the competition. The runner-up, losing semi-finalists and the players finishing fifth and sixth will move into group two, where they will be joined by the next three players in the Order of Merit. The format of the second group will be the same as the first group with players moving into the third group. In total there will be 8 groups before the final group takes place.\nThis format ensures that all players who don't win the group or finish in the last two positions will have another chance to qualify for the winners group.\nQualification.\nPlayers must have been in top 29 places in PDC Order of Merit following 2008 World Matchplay Darts in order to qualify. 31 places used because of Raymond Van Barneveld and John Part withdrawing.\nPDC Order of Merit following 2008 World Matchplay Darts.\n1.

Wes Newton\nPlayer omissions and delays.\nRaymond van Barneveld, who is taking a two-month sabbatical from darts, and John Part, based in Canada, will not be competing in the tournament. Adrian Lewis will also enter in group 3, not group 1 as his ranking would suggest, because he has been suspended from playing in any PDC tournaments for two months following an altercation with Kevin Painter. Peter Manley is also entering the competition later than his ranking would suggest, for unknown reasons.\nOn 1 September it was announced that Dennis Priestley had withdrawn from group 2 due to his ongoing treatment for prostate cancer. As such he has been replaced in group 2 by Mervyn King. Subsequent group line-ups have also changed, with players from later groups being brought into earlier ones. Priestley hopes to return in time for group 7.\nPrize money.\nThe prize money for the tournament is a unique concept with players winning a set amount of money for each leg that they win.\nGroups 1 – 8.\nIn groups 1 – 8 the prize money will be as follows:\nWinners Group.\nIn the winners group the prize money will be as follows:\nIn addition the winners group will have separate prizes for the winner, runner-up and losing semi-finalists.

It was the sixth appearance of the event, which had not been featured at the 1900 Games. The competition was held on Saturday July 19, 1924 and on Sunday July 20, 1924. There were 30 competitors from 15 nations. Nations were limited to three swimmers each, down from four in 1920. The United States swept the medals for the second consecutive Games, winning its fourth consecutive gold medal. Johnny Weissmuller beat two-time defending champion Duke Kahanamoku in the final. Kahanamoku was the first man to win three medals in the event. His brother Samuel Kahanamoku earned the bronze medal.\nBackground.\nThis was the sixth appearance of the men's 100 metre freestyle. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.\nOne of the five finalists from 1920 returned: two-time gold medalist Duke Kahanamoku of the United States. American Johnny Weissmuller, the world record holder in the event, was a heavy favorite in the event. His teammates, Duke and Samuel Kahanamoku, were also strong contenders.\nArgentina, Spain, and Yugoslavia each made their debut in the event. The United States made its sixth appearance, having competed at each edition of the event to date.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a three-round (quarterfinals, semifinals, final) format. The advancement rule was the one used since 1912; for each round before the final, the top two in each heat plus the fastest third-place swimmer would advance. There were 6 quarterfinals of between 4 and 6 swimmers, allowing 13 swimmers to advance to the semifinals. The 2 semifinals had 6 or 7 swimmers; 5 advanced to the final.\nEach race involved two lengths of the 50-metre pool.\nRecords.\nThese were the standing world and Olympic records (in minutes) prior to the 1924 Summer Olympics.\nIn the second semifinal Johnny Weissmuller set a new Olympic record with 1:00.8 minutes. In the final he bettered his record with a time of 59.0 seconds.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe fastest two in each heat and the fastest third-placed from across the heats advanced.\nSemifinals.\nThe fastest two in each semi-final and the faster of the two third-placed swimmer advanced to the final."

All three (and Ron Bryers) would surely have otherwise gone to South Africa.\" Smith's official All Black profile now acknowledges \"the unforgivable weakness shown by New Zealand rugby\".\nKiwi Blake (who was of African American heritage but played for the Māori All Blacks) is quoted as saying that after a trial match he, Bevan and Smith were told by a selector that \"If you had been eligible, you would have all gone\". Researcher and historian Malcolm Mulholland wrote the All Blacks captain Fred Allen \"later mourned the loss of Smith and, in particular, Bevan...as one of the main reasons for the All Blacks' four-nil series drubbing\". The squad that did go refused to perform the traditional haka before any match on the tour in protest with Jim Parker citing: \"The war cry is a creation of the Māoris and as we have no Māoris with us we are not giving the war cry.\"\nIn 2010 the rugby unions of New Zealand and South Africa, and the South African government, apologised for this selection policy which was implemented at the South Africans' request by the NZRFU, which at the time had said that it \"did not want to subject them [i.e. Māori] to possible reprisals\".\nAs this tour took place, a simultaneous Australia tour to New Zealand led to the unusual situation of two All Black tests on 3 September 1949, in Durban and Wellington. The All Blacks lost both. One reason for New Zealand affording the Australian series test status was to allow Māori players excluded from South Africa to earn caps."

        "text": "Jeffrei Allan D. Chan (born February 11, 1983) is a Filipino professional basketball player for the NorthPort Batang Pier of the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA). After being snubbed in the 2008 PBA draft, he became known as one of the best three-point shooters of his generation.\nEarly life and college career.\nChan was born and raised in Bacolod. He grew up with his mother and one brother, as his father had left the family.\nHe started playing basketball for the University of St. La Salle (USLS) in grade school where he competed in various tournaments and earned numerous titles for the school. In those days, he played as a power forward, emulating power forward Horace Grant. He was also an erstwhile member of a champion team in the ADIDAS Streetball Challenge in Western Visayas. During his high school years in the USLS, he played in numerous leagues in Bacolod and was also chosen to be one of the players for Western Visayas to play in the Palarong Pambansa. It was during his high school years that he started working on his outside shot. He then got many playing offers from different schools in Metro Manila where he chose to join the San Beda College training camp. But even before school started, he decided to return to play one last year with the USLS.\nHe then moved to Far Eastern University to play for the Tamaraws. In his rookie season, he scored nine points in Game 2 of the UAAP Finals to help FEU claim its 18th title. The Tamaraws were then awarded the 2004 championship after eligibility issues with De La Salle, and beat De La Salle again for the title in 2005. He averaged 18.6 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 3.0 assists per game during his senior year.\nProfessional career.\nRed Bull Barako / Barako Bull.\nUpon graduation, Chan was drafted 17th overall by Red Bull Barako in the 2008 PBA draft. Coming into the draft, he was expected to be a first-round pick, but he slipped to the late second round. He signed a two-year deal with Red Bull. The snub motivated him to work harder. He had 15 points in a close loss to the Sta. Lucia Realtors. He followed that up with 23 points in a win over the Alaska Aces. In a rematch with the Realtors, he hit 23 points again to get the win, although the team failed to make it to the Philippine Cup playoffs. After the departure of Cyrus Baguio from the Barako Bull Energy Boosters, Chan became one of the go-to-guys and scoring threats of the team until 2009, when he was traded to the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters.\nRain or Shine Elasto Painters.\nEarly years (2009–2011).\nChan, along with Mike Hrabak, was traded to Rain or Shine for Rob Wainwright and Mark Andaya.

However, Rain or Shine would lose the series, sending Powerade to the Finals.\nDuring the 2012 PBA All-Star Weekend, Chan participated in both the PBA Legends Game and the Three-Point Shootout. He then started Rain or Shine's Governors' Cup campaign with 20 points in a win over Alaska. Together with Gabe Norwood, they combined for 34 points in a win over Barako Bull. Rain or Shine finally made their first Finals appearance in Finals history that conference. In Game 3 of the Finals, he scored 18 points (with 11 coming in the third) as Rain or Shine took a 2–1 lead in the series.

Quiñahan made a game-winning three with .7 seconds remaining. In Game 2 of their semifinals rematch against Petron, he scored 20 points to lead his team to a 2–0 lead. Rain or Shine this time was able to beat Petron 4–1, setting them up for another Finals rematch with San Mig, whom they beat in 2012. In Game 1, he scored only eight points, but his back to back three pointers helped Rain or Shine take the lead, before his teammate Paul Lee sealed the win with a bank shot. He scored 18 points in Game 2, but defending San Mig's Joe Devance drained his energy and San Mig tied the series. In Game 3, he had a chance to win the game for the Painters, but poor execution led to him taking a deep three pointer with Marc Pingris defending him. The shot missed and the Coffee Mixers took a 2–1 lead. In a must win Game 5, he scored 23 of his 24 points in the second half to keep Rain or Shine alive in the series 3–2.

Against Barako, he and Rain or Shine import AZ Reid combined to score all but one of the Elasto Painters’ last 11 points that enabled them to claim the win. He then shot a scorching 64.7% from the field in their next two wins, earning him another Player of the Week award. In the semifinals, he had a hyperextended elbow, which affected his shooting. Still, Rain or Shine made it back to the Finals. There, San Mig beat them once again in a best-of-five series, and achieved history with a Grand Slam.\nDealing with injury (2014–15).\nIn Rain or Shine's fourth game of the 2014–15 Philippine Cup, Chan scored 16 points (with almost all but two of them coming in the second quarter), but Talk 'N Text got the blowout win over them.

He was able to return in Game 6, and scored 11 points to force a Game 7. Talk 'N Text however was able to win Game 7 in double overtime.\nChan missed the start of the 2015 Governors' Cup to recover from the injury he suffered the previous conference.

Phoenix head coach Ariel Vanguardia wanted him for his experience and as a mentor to their star player Matthew Wright. The trade was a surprise to Chan, as he thought he would only play for Rain or Shine for the rest of his career. In his debut, he had 27 points (with 13 in the second quarter), four rebounds, five assists, and four steals. However, he had a team-high seven turnovers which was one of the reasons Meralco went on to win the game. He had 14 points but cramped up midway through the third quarter as Phoenix suffered its fifth straight loss.\nDuring a 2017–18 Philippine Cup game against NLEX, Chan scored 18 points on 8-of-11 shooting in 27 minutes off the bench. He also added six boards, three assists, and committed just one turnover in that game, despite missing their previous game due to a flu and sore eyes.

Ginebra head coach Tim Cone wanted him as Ginebra had championship aspirations. Phoenix meanwhile did the trade as they wanted to give minutes to other players. He only had four points in his debut, but his leadership was apparent as Ginebra won against the Columbian Dyip. In Game 1 of their quarterfinals against Meralco, he finally hit his first three, finishing with eight points in the win. In Game 1 of the semifinals, which was against Rain or Shine, he unleashed 21 points in just 22 minutes of action as he helped Ginebra get the win.

In the 2018 Governors' Cup semifinals, he became the 91st player to hit the 5,000 points milestone.\n1st Governors' Cup title with Ginebra (2019).\nChan missed the start of Ginebra's season as he just had bone spurs surgery. He finally made his season debut in a win over Columbian. They failed to win a Philippine Cup title that season, as they were eliminated by the Magnolia Hotshots in Game 3, despite his 17 fourth quarter points.\nIn a game against Blackwater, Chan landed his foot on Blackwater's James Sena.

He scored 12 again against Meralco while adding four rebounds and two blocks as Ginebra opened the season 3–0. He scored nine as Magnolia snapped their winning streak. In the semifinals, he aggravated a hamstring injury and missed some games. Despite playing hurt, he was able to contribute in the Finals as he finally won his first Philippine Cup title.\nFinal seasons with Ginebra (2021–2022).\nIn the 2021 Governors' Cup, Chan sprained his ankle in a win over Blackwater, but kept playing. He had a vintage performance against Rain or Shine when he scored 12 of his 15 points in the second half that helped Ginebra get the win. In Game 4 of their semis against NLEX, he scored 20 points to support Justin Brownlee's 47 as Ginebra returned to the Finals. There, they beat Meralco once again in six games.\nIn the offseason, Chan signed a new one-year contract with the team. In the elimination round against NorthPort, he contributed 11 points, two assists and two rebounds. In Game 1 of their playoff quarterfinal series against Meralco, he scored 11 points in a loss.

He had 12 points in a win over NLEX. In Game 2 of their Commissioner's Cup playoff series against Ginebra, he had 20 points, five rebounds, and six assists, but it wasn't enough as Ginebra moved on to the semifinals.\nIn 2023, Chan was voted in by fans as an All-Star Game reserve. However, he begged off from playing, and was replaced by Alex Cabagnot.\nNational team career.\nChan first joined the Philippines men's national basketball team in 2007. He was part of the team that won gold in that year's SEA Games. He could have played in the 2005 SEA Games if not for FIBA's suspension of the Philippines during that time.\nIn 2013, Chan was called up to Gilas 2.0 after players in his position such as James Yap, Mark Caguioa, and PJ Simon weren't able to commit. In his time with Gilas, he helped the team win the 2012 Jones Cup, finish runner-up in the 2013 FIBA Asia Men's Championship, and participated in the Philippines' first FIBA World Cup stint in 2014 after a 36-year absence. He also was a member of the team that finished seventh in the 2014 Asian Games, the worst in Philippine history.\nIn 2015, Chan was not released to Gilas 3.0 by Rain or Shine, as only Gabe Norwood was released by the team. He was later included in the roster for the 2016 FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament.\nPlayer profile.\nChan has been compared to 1990s PBA sharpshooter Allan Caidic because of the similarities of their playing styles, and the similarities of their looks. He is left-handed, like Caidic, and often shoots from the left side of the court. He used to be seen as just a shooter, but over time, became more of a slasher.\nPBA career statistics.\n\"As of the end of 2022–23 season\"\nPersonal life.\nChan is married with two daughters. He met his future wife at a cousin's wedding. He is known to be very hands-on in raising his children. His youngest daughter Aerin played in the 2022 Junior World Golf Championships."

        "title": "Top Gear Winter Olympics",
        "text": "Top Gear: Winter Olympics is a full-length, special edition episode for BBC motoring programme \"Top Gear\", and is the first in a series of full-length specials for the show. The episode was aired on 12 February 2006, with a repeat of the episode being aired a week later on 19 February. The special saw hosts Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May travelling to Lillehammer, Norway and creating their own version of the Winter Olympics with cars. The episode was later released on DVD on 5 June later that year.\nSummary.\nWith the 20th Winter Olympic Games being held in Turin, Italy, Top Gear decides to do its own version with cars, with Jeremy Clarkson and James May heading to one of the Winter Games' former venues – Lillehammer, in Norway, used during the 1994 Winter Games – and beginning proceedings, despite Richard Hammond not being there; he was apparently \"appearing on commercial daytime television\" – referring to Richard Hammond's 5 O'Clock Show – while the pair began the first set of events.\nEvents.\nIn a race between Clarkson and May, the pair took to a snowy, cross-country course with some off-road SUVs, where along the way, each presenter had to stop at 2 shooting rounds and hit all the targets in each round from the back of their cars, incurring a 5 seconds penalty for each target missed. May choose the Audi Q7 and used a standard Biathlon .22 rifle for the shooting rounds, while Clarkson raced in a Volvo XC90 and opted to use a H&amp;K MP5 Sub machine gun, but despite the increased firepower, he missed all his targets on the first shooting round, allowing his rival to increase the lead he had. May's second shooting round was not as perfect as his first, and he incurred a ten-second penalty for missing targets, before crashing into a tree on his way to the finish line. Clarkson, although missing all his targets again in the second round, managed to overtake May as he was digging himself out, but just before he reached the end, Clarkson lost the lead to his rival, coming in second after May crossed the line and won the event.\nAlthough not with them at Lillehammer, Hammond had earlier done a film for the special, in which he saw whether a man would break first from Arctic temperatures, or a car. Sitting within a Citroën C1, in a bid to see who would crack first, both the presenter and the car were subjected to ever decreasing temperatures, with Hammond testing the car's electrics and engine. Finally, after being subjected to a temperature of about minus-40 Celsius, Hammond could not start the C1 and thus proved that a man could last longer than the car, concluding that 'if you're going to drive to the North Pole, buy a Hammond'.\nHis conclusion was disproved when he took part in a race against a car to the North Pole, and lost, as was shown in the following Series 9 of the show.\nReturning to Norway, Clarkson prepared himself for a 3-lap race on the ice course of Vikingskipet Olympic Arena, between a Jaguar XK and a human skater, whom May introduced as Eskil Ervik. While Ervik got off to a good start, the XK could not utilize its power as the car had no grip on the ice and thus could only move forward slowly and not corner so well, while the wheels constantly spun upon the surface. Not only did this allow Ervik to win the race, it also allowed him to lap the XK twice.\nIn another race between Clarkson and May, the presenters took to completing a course against the clock, on a frozen lake with just five inches of ice. The race was between a four-wheel drive Land Rover Discovery and another two-wheel drive Jaguar XK. The race ended with a dispute about the result – while May declared he was the winner by being the fastest with a time of 2:03.28, Clarkson claimed otherwise by saying that his run had been more graceful and interesting than his colleague's.\nIn a re-run of a film shown during Series 5 Episode 8 of the show, Hammond and May travelled to Lillehammer in 2004 to make use of the bobsleigh course. Their aim was to see if a bobsleigh team aided by Hammond, who would be subject to cornering forces of up to 5G, could beat a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution rally car, which would be driven by Norwegian Henning Solberg with May as co-driver. For the rally car, it would run on a snowy dirt road that had exactly the same length of the course, not only starting and stopping the same places, but also consisting of slippery surfaces and sharp corners. While the bobsleigh would be timed by the course officials, May would be timing the rally car. Despite a close race, the bobsleigh turned in a time of 59.68 at the end, beating the rally car by just over 2 seconds after it came in with a time of 1:02.24.\nOn a break from daytime television, Hammond finally arrived in Lillehammer, and prepared himself to take on May in a game of \"5-a-side Car Ice Hockey\". Using ten Suzuki Swifts and with Clarkson acting as referee, Hammond was captain of \"team daytime television\" who played in Montreal Canadiens colours, while May was captain of \"team primetime television\" who played in Buffalo Sabres colours. From the start, Hammond's team played well and led 3–0, but a biased Clarkson began intervening in the match and allowed May to catch up with two goals, allowing the score to be 3–2. After one of the Swifts had to be replaced, Hammond crashed into May's car and was sent to the penalty box (\"sin bin\"), before being allowed out after May attempted to score more goals, just as the match ended, with his side winning. Although Hammond declared he was returning to daytime television following the match, upon learning what the next event was planning, he quickly declared he was staying for it.\nBehind the scenes, the score supposedly had been 5–4 to Hammond's team, although only three of May's team's goals were shown in the programme.\nAfter watching a skier perform a ski jump off a downhill slope, the presenters learned they had been tasked to see if they could get a 1986 Mini to do the same jump and landing it further than the skier did. After thinking over whether this could be done with the car's own power, May revealed it would not have any chance of success; there was also concerns it would be unsafe for anyone drive the Mini while attempting the ski jump. Thus, Clarkson called in for help from the United Kingdom Rocketry Association. \n The following day, May, tasked with handling the unmanned Mini's guidance, revealed that the car would need skis for the special groves that would be cut for it on the ski jump they were using. The Rocketry Association, who were working on the Power for the jump (with Clarkson's help), decided to also work on making some custom-made skis for the Mini upon learning of this. Meanwhile, Hammond began work on setting up a barrier to stop the Mini after it made its jump, but after making a clumsy one before the wrong jump, recruited a herd of tractors to set up a wall of hay bales at the bottom of the jump, backed with a large snow bank to ensure the car stopped fully and safely. As night fell, the Mini, now laden with rockets, was carefully put into place on the special groves and winched to the top of the jump, given final checks, and eventually was launched down the jump. Although it failed to beat the skier's distance, the presenters were more than satisfied that the Mini had managed to successfully do the ski jump, which was extraordinary feat in itself.\nWith the final event completed, Hammond left, while Clarkson and May decided to stay behind for one last challenge – to see if a ski jump could be done by a snowmobile. For this last challenge, the pair revealed that The Stig had been saved for this task, and successfully performed the jump with the snowmobile, with Clarkson joking about the pain he would be feeling from his landing, as the special came to an end.\nThe end credits of the edited as a reference to the members of Swedish pop group ABBA, with Jeremy Clarkson shown as \"Björn Clarkson\", Richard Hammond as \"Benny Hammond\", James May as \"Agnetha May\" and The Stig as \"Anni-Frid Stig\", whilst every other crew member had their first name replaced with Björn.\nVehicles.\nThe following vehicles below were used in the filming of this special episode of \"Top Gear\":\nReception.\nThe motoring programme's \"Winter Olympics Special\" was viewed by 5 million people on its first showing, with a further 530,000 watching the repeat when it aired a week later. In a review for \"The Guardian\", Kathryn Flett described the \"Winter Olympics Special\" as a funny episode, with the Mini segment making her \"giggle\", before adding that the special was \"entirely complementary to the Winter Olympics proper\"."

Also, the first Rugby League Catalan University Championship was played in February 2009, with 9 teams in competition.\nCatalonia used to be an unranked member of the Rugby League European Federation; however, their participation in some international rugby league competitions, such as the World Cup, has been questioned as Catalonia is not a sovereign nation.\nCatalonia played their first match in January 2008 when they participated in the French Interleague Championship held near Perpignan, France. In June of the same year, Morocco beat Catalonia in a match played in Perpignan, 62–12.\nIn June 2009, Catalonia beat the Czech Republic in a match played prior to the Catalans Dragons vs Warrington Wolves Super League game. This match was an international warm-up ahead of the Euro Med Challenge contested by Catalonia, Morocco and Belgium. They lost 6–29 at home to Morocco, and 28–22 at Belgium.\nIn 2010 Catalonia played only friendlies, with a win over Czech Republic 16–66 in Prague.\nFollowing further disputes over their RLEF status, the Catalonia national team did not subsequently participate in international competition and their RLEF affiliation was later dropped. They are currently not active in international competition, and any further international activity will likely fall under the umbrella of the Spain national rugby league team."

        "text": "Tom Arthur (10 January 1906 – 1 November 1986) was a Welsh international rugby union lock who played club rugby for Neath and was capped 18 times for Wales. A tough second row forward with a strong physique, Arthur was often criticised for being over-vigorous. Though his style of play was fairly typical for Welsh rugby at the time.\nArthur was also a strong scummager and was adaptable in the open and was excellent in the line-out. His signature move was his line-out 'flip', where he would grab the ball one handed and guide it to his waiting scrum-half.\nInternational rugby career.\nArthur joined Neath from Glynneath RFC in 1923, and made his debut for the club in a game against Pontypool in December that year. After consistent good play for Neath, he showed promise in Welsh trials and was selected to the national squad in 1927 to face Scotland as part of the Five Nations Championship. Wales lost the game, but Arthur was reselected to face both France and Ireland in the later stages of the same tournament. The Welsh forwards were terrible in the game against Ireland and their eight-man pack was outclassed by the seven man Irish pack. Arthur was dropped for the next season, but after an outstanding Neath season, he was back for the 1929 Five Nations Championship.\nArthur was well known for his aggressive style of play, and this was shown in two matches against in France. In 1929, Arthur scored a try for Wales at the Cardiff Arms Park and three French players were knocked out in the tackle to save the try. The next year at a game at the Stade Colombes, the mood and the match turned nasty with the French using fist and boot to subdue the Welsh team. The trouble started when Welsh full back Tommy Scourfield cleared a loose ball to touch only for the chasing French player to run over and punch him. Arthur and fellow second row, Aberavon's Ned Jenkins had to pack down in the front row due to the oversized French props, and after one scrummage, Welsh hooker Bert Day was kicked in the mouth by a French lock and required nine stitches. Arthur retaliated on the French pack, but mistook one of the props for the offending lock. This escalated into running fist fights throughout the match, and when Wales left the pitch, they were pelted by rubber cushions from the crowd.\nIn 1931 Arthur was capped to face the touring South Africans. He had been part of the joint Neath / Aberavon team that had faced the Springboks at the Gnoll in November. The tourist were lucky to win the match after a dubious last minute try, and when Arthur was picked for Wales he did so with two other players from the same match, Ned Jenkins and Arthur Lemon. Although he was dropped for the 1932 season, Arthur was back for the 1933 Home Nations Championship, playing against England and Scotland.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

Double reigning Olympic champion Svetlana Masterkova was chasing on the outside with Ludmila Formanová boxed on the inside behind Clark. Clark kept Mutola on the outside throughout the turn. Coming off the turn, the action began. Clark injected her sprinter's speed, pulling away from Mutola for a few strides. At the same time, Masterkova pulled out to lane 3 to get running room on Mutola. This freed Formanová who went behind Masterkova and out to lane 4 for running room. 50 metres out it was three abreast with Formanová trailing, but Clark couldn't hold the lead and faded. Mutola and Masterkova moved past, but Masterkova couldn't get past Mutola.

It has screened more than 350 short movies from more than 30 countries since its debut in 2006. Each year around 20 films compete for the award \"Goldene Kurbel\" and the awards of the audience. The Neistat Brothers, Michaël Dudok de Wit, Andrea Dorfman, Tomer Shushan, Lucas Brunelle, Steven Subotnick, Nash Edgerton, M. A. Numminen and other filmmakers and artists contributed to the ICFF.\nThe last and 16th International Cycling Film Festival screened 17 bike films from 10 countries. Approximately 350 participants attended the festival in Germany, around 200 participated in the Polish edition of the ICFF. The 12th ICFF began the season in October 2017 in Herne with 19 films. Further venues are Groningen and Wiesbaden in March 2018, Munich in June and Katowice in September 2018.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe International Cycling Film Festival was established in December 2005 in Bochum by the chairman of the cycling club Team Hollandse Frietjes – non-professional cycling, Gernot Mühge. The festival launched in September 2006 under the name \"International Cycling Video Festival\" (). Featured were 17 films from the US, Scotland, Switzerland, Austria and Germany. The first three festivals took place at “Goldkante”, a club for the local art scene and social-cultural events in Bochum. During these years the festival was arranged as a three-days festival, containing two film evenings at the first two days and ending with a time trial for both cyclists and movie makers at the third day. The laudatory for the \"Goldene Kurbel\" in these years was Frank Hörner, director of the \"Theater Kohlenpott\", which is a children and youth theatre in the Flottmann-Hallen, Herne. He facilitated the transfer of the ICFF from Bochum to nearby Herne.\nFlottmann-Hallen years.\nSince a continuous growth by an increasing number of participants and a rising variety and quality of film contributions the festival was renamed \"International Cycling Film Festival” 2009. Also the festival's venue “Goldkante” became too small for the audience over the years. Based on the existing cooperation to the \"Theater Kohlenpott\" the makers of the festival decided to move the 4th International Cycling Film Festival to Herne 2009. From then until now the festival takes place at the Flottmann-Hallen, a former machine-tool factory, which was transformed into a cultural centre for Herne following its closure in 1983. During the years 2010 to 2012 the ICFF was included in the “VVicycle- Herne Film and Bicycle Days”, an organizational umbrella for different film festivals taking place in the Flottmann-Hallen.\n“The fantastic bicycle film\" () was the particular motto of the 6th International Cycling Film Festival. The motto was repeated as \"The fantastic bicycle film reloaded\" during the 8th ICFF 2013. These two specific programs included anime, animation and auteur films from Argentina, Austria, Greece, Germany, Japan, Italy, Poland and Portugal.\nPolish-German period of the ICFF.\nIn Summer 2011, during a meeting on future cooperation among bicycle activists in the Ruhr district held in the bike kitchen in Dortmund, Aleksander Kopia, founder of the Silesian Bicycle Initiative (), Poland met people from the ICFF. From that point the Polish initiative is a partner of the ICFF. First guest performances in Poland occurred in the Silesian Voivodeship in Katowice and in Częstochowa in summer 2012. This gave rise to the idea of setting up a second ICFF in Poland based on equal partnership between the Polish and German makers of the ICFF. So 2013 the program of the festival was shown simultaneously in Herne and Częstochowa. Furthermore, a new prize for bicycle-related films was created. The award was named \"Trzy złote szprychy\" () and is the audience award of the festival's Polish edition. In 2014, the Polish edition of the ICFF moved from Częstochowa to Kraków. Since that time the ICFF is under the patronage of the German Consulate General in Kraków. The Polish festival edition is supported by the Goethe-Institut, a German cultural association encouraging international cultural exchange.\nA Dutch-Polish-German film festival since 2015.\nIn 2014 the Dutch movie maker Erwin Zantinga from Groningen became a new member of the ICFF board after he presented his film “Two wheels and a hayfork” at the 9th ICFF in Herne personally. Due to this new cooperation between Dutch, Polish and German festival makers Groningen became an additional venue off the ICFF. In the same time the makers of the ICFF started collaboration with the party Alliance '90/The Greens of the municipality of Wiesbaden. As a result, the German Film Heritage Foundation Murnau Stiftung was found as the fifth fixed venue of the ICFF. It is now a trinational festival with board members from and fixed venues in Poland, the Netherlands and Germany.\nWith its further expansion also the approach of the festival was more and more outlined. Nowadays its mission is two-fold. First, the ICFF focuses on the bicycle as a subject of cinematic art. This part of the festival is represented by movie makers like , Michaël Dudok de Wit, Jörn Staeger, or Michael Klöfkorn, who contributed to the festival. Second, the ICFF screens films as a means of expression in the fast growing bicycle culture. It is a forum for movie makers from the bicycle community like Lucas Brunelle or Casey Neistat.\nAward Goldene Kurbel.\nThe Goldene Kurbel () is the highest prize awarded to the best film in the festival, counting as The Oscar for bicycle films. It is the oldest film prize for bicycle-related films. \nThe award is chosen by a jury of local film, bicycle and art experts who are also in charge for the official selection of the festival program. The Goldene Kurbel consists of a golden right-side crank arm of a bicycle on the top of a wooden base. The crank stands as a symbol for the bicycle and refers also to the crank of early hand-cranked film cameras.\nAwardees.\nPolish-German movie maker Nena Adelajda Olczak wins the Goldenen Kurbel of the 16th ICFF in 2021 for \"Welcome to Polotubbieland\". Things are sporty in Polotubbieland: dressed in Polish national colours, its inhabitants skilfully do cartwheels or ride around on the road bike. In contrast to the perfect world of fitness on the visual level, the film reveals on the soundtrack the abysses of contemporary Polish cultural politics, its radical break with artistic freedom and freedom of opinion in the name of the nation state. Populism leaves no room for the other, the foreign. \"Dirty migrants go home\" chant right-wing polotubbie artists in the bitter ending of the touching experimental film.\nThe Goldene Kurbel of the 13th ICFF was given to \"Tigersprung\" (Tiger leap), a film by Boaz Kaizman, Peter Rosenthal and Stefan Seibert about Albert Richter, 1932 amateur world champion on the track, murdered in 1940 by the German secret police Gestapo. At the center of the film is his Jewish manager, the Cologne-based Ernst Berliner, who, fleeing from the Nazis, survives the Nazi era in the Netherlands. He tries to prosecute the case in the 1960s, but the German judiciary refuses to open it. Also his former fellows in Cologne refuse him, \"the disturbance”. Ernst Berliner travels home to the US with the intention to never return to Germany. “'Tigersprung' reminds us of the confrontation with Nazi sports history,\" so festival maker Gernot Mühge in his laudatory speech: \"The film refers to what Ralph Giordano has called the second guilt of the Germans - the numerous gaps and failures in the efforts to confront the Nazi history\". \n\"Little Girl\", an animation from Steven Subotnick, USA, was awarded with the Goldene Kurbel of the 12th ICFF. The short film is about a little girl, riding her bike in a bad mood. She puts fire to houses by ringing her bell. A weird hare tries to extinguish the flames, but finally the girl overwhelmed and dominated him. \"Little Girl\" is an ambiguous film in a gloomy atmosphere, and it does provide only few guidance to the viewer. The short plays artfully with the levels of imagination, symbols and reality, so the Jury Commission of the 12th ICFF.\nThe Goldene Kurbel of the 11th ICFF was given to \"Cycologic\", a documentary about the power of women on bikes in Uganda, directed by Emilia Stålhammar, Veronica Pålsson and Elsa Lövdin, Sweden. The film was shot in Kampala, Uganda, in an absurd mess of mini vans and lorries; in this particular traffic the bicycle appears as a statement of social justice, equity and quality of life (not only) for African people. The film focusses on the political work of Amanda Ngabirano and other women for the creation of car free zones and bike lanes as well their promotion of women in cycling: “Seeing a woman riding a bicycle should not be seen as a sign of courage and fearlessness, but rather a sign of safe streets; and that should be the focus of the planning authorities”, so Amanda.\nThe winner of the 10th ICFF in 2015/2016 was Wytse Koetse for his film \"De Benen van Amsterdam\", a portrait of Frans van der Meer, Amsterdam's most authentic bicycle repairmen. The film demonstrates that bicycles are the legs of Amsterdam, and by fixing bicycles Frans keeps the city running. Wytse Koetse's touching documentary shows Frans’ 90 years old workshop transforming the big city of Amsterdam into a village, where people need their bikes fixed for their daily life, they meet and provide mutual support.\n2014 the Goldene Kurbel was given to \"The Bell\" from Pijus Mickus, Lithuania. \"The Bell\" is a film about a girl's dream of a cycle of her own, fulfilled by her loving parents. Since the bell does not ring the young owner starts her first ride to let the bell repaired. But the bike ride through the Lithuanian landscape appears difficult; the bicycle falls apart into pieces. Pijus Mickus' short shows powerfully expressive performance dance, with Indrė Pivoraitė and her bicycle as a congenial dance partner in the leading roles.\nThe prize for the best film 2013 was given to \"Three-Legged Horses\" from Felipe Bustos Sierra, Edinburgh, Scotland. His short shows an evening in the live of a professional cycle rickshaw driver, the friendly contacts with passersby, street musicians, colleagues, but also by the demanding fight against gravity, physical pain and nasty passengers. Referring to this contrast the film ends in a big brass party including the whole nightlife of Edinburgh. \"Three-Legged Horses\" shows the bright and dark site of professional bicycle driving, the fascination of free urban life, the solidarity among a modern precariat on the one hand, and on the other hand the vulnerability and toughness of this particular work life. The film won both Goldene Kurbel and audience award of the 8th ICFF.\n\"Father and Daughter\", a Dutch animation from Michaël Dudok de Wit was the Goldene Kurbel awardee in 2012. The metaphorical and touching film tells the story of a young girl, beginning with the goodbye of her father who leaves in a small boat. Over and over the girl took the bike to come back to the point where he left. This scene recurs for several stages of her life, i.e. as young woman cycling with her girlfriends, with her husband and children, as an elder woman, yet within her there is always a deep longing for her father. The compelling film won the audience award of the ICFF 2012, too.\nThe film prize 2011 was awarded to the American short \"Cycle of love\" by Catherine Marshall. It is the first contribution for the ICFF, within which bicycles play all parts in the film. The festival jury was positive about the amazing expressivity of Catherine Marshall's playing act bicycles, which was needed for the tragicomical love story of her film.\n2010 the Goldene Kurbel was given to the Romanian artist Alexei Gubenco and his movie \"Vive La Crise!\". The animation takes the economic and financial crisis as a starting point: \"The short shows in an optimistic and satirical way the benefits of the cycle for both individuals and society, referring to the (as it were) anti-consumerism character of cycling\", so the 2010th jury's comment.\nThe winner in 2009 was the German movie maker Jörn Staeger. His film \"Rad\" (English title: \"Wheel\") is a short about a bizarre cycling trip under time pressure and against bicycle-specific obstacles: men, dogs, bike chains.\nThe 2008 prize winner was the movie maker Mike Tereba from Luxembourg for his contribution \"Psyclist\", a gloomy feature film dedicated to a cyclist who was killed in a bicycle accident.\nWinners of the Goldene Kurbel in previous years were the German movie maker Sören Büngener for his film \"A Look in the Mirror\" in 2007; a year earlier, in 2006, the Goldene Kurbel was awarded to the Austrian/German artists Sylvia Winkler und Stephan Köperl and their film \"doored in downtown\".\nGrand Prize of the Jury.\nThe Grand Prize of the Jury was introduced as a special film award for the runner-up to the Goldene Kurbel at the 12th ICFF in Herne, 2017. The award is the second-most prestigious prize of the festival after the Goldene Kurbel.\nSouvenir Albert Richter.\nThe Souvenir Albert Richter was introduced at the 13th ICFF in 2018. Since then, it has been the festival's prize for the best road bike film. The award is dedicated to the German track cyclist Albert Richter, who belonged to the world's elite track sprinters in the 1930s. He was presumably murdered by the Gestapo in 1940. The Souvenir Albert Richter not only commemorates the cyclist, but above all the opponent and victim of National Socialist tyranny. The name of the price also refers to the Tour de France and its Souvenir Henri Desgrange.\nThe first Souvenir Albert Richter is won by the Belgian filmmaker Jasmijn Cedee for her experimental film \"Toer\".\nCompetition Stefan Götz.\nThe sporting \"Competition Stefan Götz\" marks the end of each German edition of the International Cycling Film Festival. It is named after the first sponsor of the Team Hollandse Frietjes. \nIn the first few years of the festival the Competition Stefan Götz took the form of an individual and team time trial over about 20 km, which was open to both audience and movie makers. 2009 the Competition Stefan Götz was a match sprint over about 800 metres, 2011 it was an Urban Cycle Polo match, 2012 a Goldsprint. From 2013 onwards it is a so-called Vinylsprint race, which is an invention of the ICFF makers.\nVinylsprint.\nThe Vinylsprint is a variation of a Goldsprint race. It was invented by one of the makers of the ICFF, Patrick Praschma, and introduced at the 8th ICFF. Similar to the Goldsprint two stationary bicycles are its basis. The bicycles are coupled with belt-drive turntables: Pedaling the stationary bicycle operates a record player. Its tone arm is connected with a computer, and the stylus works as a speed sensor for the stationary bike. The racetrack is simulated by a video projection, both cyclists have to ride a similar virtual parkour on the cinema screen.\nWinners of the Competition Stefan Götz.\n2019: Magnus Fischer, master of bicycle mechanics, Hildesheim\n2018: Boris Weidtmann, Duisburg\n2017: Christoph Lotz, lawyer, Bochum\n2016: Philipp Todtberg, carpentry student, Dortmund\n2015: Uwe Hermesmeier, board member ADFC Mönchengladbach, Mönchengladbach\n2014 and 2013: Axel Rickel, bicycle salesman, Dortmund\n2012: Pierre Cournoyer, performing artist at Roomservice, Herne\n2011: Bike Polo Team \"Champagneros\", Duisburg\n2009: Gernot Mühge, founding director of the ICFF, Bochum\n2008: Thomas Wisiolek, amateur cyclist\n2007: Rolf Trovato, amateur cyclist\n2006: Holger Zepper, movie maker\nGuest performances.\nBeside the fixed venues the ICFF gives numerous guest performances all over Europe. Basically the ICFF has got two concepts. First is a screening of the current program of the ICFF, i.e. in 2016/2017 the program of the 11th ICFF. Second and more often, the ICFF creates a tailor-made program in dialogue with the local people and organizers. The film selection is taken from the ICFF film archive that includes several hundred bike related short films. Based on this archive particular performances were developed in the past, like “Bike Animation Night”, “The Fantastic Bicycle Movie”, “Bike adventures”, “German Bike Shorts”.\nThe first guest performance of the ICFF took place in the German Museum for Sport and Olympics (), Cologne and in the Centennial Hall () during the festival “Bicycle Summer of Industrial Culture”, in 2011.\nIn 2017 guest performances take place in several cities in Germany (Munich, Mainz, Wiesbaden, Hattingen and others), in France (Lille, Roubaix), in the Netherlands (Amersfoort), in Poland (Katowice and others) and in Belarus (Minsk). During summer 2017 the ICFF goes on tour across Russia, with an opening in Moscow in the Goethe Institut and the Embassy of Germany, Moscow and venues in St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and others."

        "text": "The 2010 World Rowing Championships were World Rowing Championships that were held from 31 October to 7 November 2010 on Lake Karapiro near Cambridge, New Zealand. The annual week-long rowing regatta was organised by FISA (the International Rowing Federation). Usually held at the end of the northern hemisphere summer, they were held later in the year in the southern hemisphere. In non-Olympic years the regatta is the highlight of the international rowing calendar.\nBackground.\nThe World Rowing Championships were previously held at Lake Karapiro in 1978. Rowing's international body said Lake Karapiro's 2010 World Rowing Championships raised the bar for the rest of the world and more international events would be held there.\nThe 2010 World Rowing Championships turned out to be one of the most impressive championships ever. Of the 161 races at the championships, Robert Treharne Jones, FISA commentator (GBR). commentated 88 of them, “by far my favourite race was the men’s pair. It was an awesome race and it was all that it was billed to be and more. Although it was a six boat final it was really one on one between New Zealand and Great Britain and to have them so close all the way. The crowd were literally on their feet. The event was great from every point of view. I can’t fault it. The organisers worked very hard to get everything right.”\nIt was predicted that it would take at least 70,000 people to make back the £16m price tag [but 66,000 attended]. The event lost $2.2m and a report by SPARC (Sport And Recreation New Zealand, rebranded as Sport New Zealand in 2012) found that a lack of clarity around roles and responsibilities of the Karapiro 2010 Board was a factor, alongside others mostly relating to shortcomings in governance, inadequate financial management, and less revenue than expected from ticket sales.\nSPARC chief executive Peter Miskimmin said the review was a stark reminder for everyone involved in hosting major events in New Zealand, including the Government agencies which invest in them. “The Karapiro 2010 Board was committed to putting on a world-class event, and they achieved that. Operationally the event was a huge success.\" Miskimmin said, adding that the findings of the SPARC review would be used to develop additional good practice guidelines for those running future major events.\nWith the roaring success of the world championships behind them, Rowing New Zealand is eager to make further use of their world-class facility at Lake Karapiro.\nTo interpret abbreviations in medals tables see Glossary of rowing terms.

        "text": "The 1978 FIFA World Cup final was a football match played to determine the winner of the 1978 FIFA World Cup. The match was contested by hosts Argentina and the Netherlands, in the biggest stadium used in the tournament and in Argentina, the Estadio Monumental in the Argentine capital city of Buenos Aires. The match was won by the Argentine squad in extra time by a score of 3–1. Mario Kempes, who finished as the tournament's top scorer, was named the man of the match. The Netherlands lost their second World Cup final in a row, both times to the host nation, after losing to West Germany in 1974. This was also the second World Cup tournament in a row won by the host nation. It was the only World Cup final between 1950 and 2002 that did not feature Germany or Brazil.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe start of the final was mired in controversy, as the Dutch accused the Argentines of using stalling tactics to delay the match, causing tension to build in front of a hostile Buenos Aires crowd. The host team eventually came out five minutes late after the audience was whipped into a frenzy. The Argentines also questioned the legality of a plaster cast on René van de Kerkhof's wrist, despite him having worn it in earlier games without objections, causing the Dutch to threaten to walk off the pitch; the Italian referee, Sergio Gonella, upheld the complaints and forced Van de Kerkhof to apply extra bandage. In retaliation, the Netherlands team refused to attend the post-match ceremonies.\nThe match itself saw a number of fouls, and a hostile atmosphere. Ticker tape and confetti in the stadium worked its way onto the pitch. Mario Kempes scored the first goal of the match, slotting under Jan Jongbloed from 12 yards out. The Netherlands almost equalised when Rob Rensenbrink latched onto to a headed pass from René van de Kerkhof, but the shot was kept out by the boot of Ubaldo Fillol. The Dutch eventually equalised when René van de Kerkhof's cross found substitute Dick Nanninga, who headed home the equaliser. The Dutch could have won the game in the final minutes, when Rensenbrink latched onto a long ball poking a shot past Fillol, but the shot bounced off the post, and the match went to extra time. Kempes netted the eventual winner in the 105th minute after running into the box, evading two Dutch sliding tackles as he did so. Kempes' shot was saved by Jongbloed and Kempes jumped to avoid him, but the ball bounced off of Jongbloed and hit Kempes twice, first in the knee, then in the foot, before bouncing off Jongbloed's head, all before Kempes had even landed. The ball bounced high in the air, and two Dutch defenders came rushing to clear the ball from the open goal. Although the goal was officially given to Kempes, the replay from behind the goal showed that the ball might have come off Wim Suurbier last.\nDaniel Bertoni sealed the game in the second half of extra time after Kempes made a long run into the box, and was tackled by a Dutch defender. The ball ricocheted several times before landing at the feet of Bertoni, who had a clear sight of goal inside the box. Jongbloed was unsighted by the ricochet, and was thus out of position, allowing Bertoni to slot in easily.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules"

        "text": "The forward defence is one of the most commonly used shots in cricket.\nThe prime objective of playing a forward defence shot is to block the ball rather than to score runs. But there can be opportunities to score from this shot, if the shot is particularly well timed, or if the batsmen run a quick single.\nPlayed to a good length ball, the batsman attempts to defend his wicket by smothering the ball before it has an opportunity to spin or move off the seam. With a well-bent front knee, the shot can also help combat variable bounce."

        "text": "The West Indies cricket team toured New Zealand between 5 December 2008, and 13 January 2009. They played two Test matches, two Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is) and five One Day Internationals (ODIs) against the hosts, plus a three-day match against State Championship side Auckland. This was the first series between the sides since the West Indies toured New Zealand in 2005–06; their previous meeting was in the Super 8 stage of the 2007 Cricket World Cup.\nNew Zealand cricket team.\nThe New Zealand side had just returned from the first leg of a tour to Australia where they played two Test matches against the hosts, losing both. Prior to the second test against Australia, Andy Moles was announced as the replacement for retiring New Zealand coach John Bracewell with the West Indian series to be his first in charge of the team. One of his first moves was to replace a number of support staff and insist that he and captain Daniel Vettori be \"the only voices in the dressing room\". He also switched the roles of batsmen Daniel Flynn and Jesse Ryder, deciding that Flynn was better suited to the number 3 position and Ryder to the number 5.\nAt the start of the Test series, the New Zealand team were eighth on the ICC Test Championship rankings.\nWest Indian cricket team.\nThe West Indies had recently lost all three matches of an ODI series against Pakistan. Their previous Test series was at home to Australia in May and June 2008, when they lost two Tests and drew one. At the beginning of the Test series, they were ranked seventh in the ICC Test Championship, one spot higher than New Zealand.\nSquads.\nThe New Zealand team for the Test series was announced on 6 December while the West Indies named their side on 5 November.\nFirst leg.\nTour match.\nThe only warm-up match for the West Indies was a three-day match against State Championship side Auckland. Having lost the toss and been put in to field on a batting-friendly pitch, the West Indian bowlers could only manage two wickets on the first day. Auckland reached 359/2 at stumps with Richard Jones leading the way on 186 not out. On day two Jones continued on to his maiden first-class double century before being dismissed for 201. The Auckland side continued batting until just before tea, declaring at 587/7 once Gareth Hopkins had brought up his century. At stumps on the second day, the West Indian team had reached 82 without losing a wicket. They batted throughout the final day, finishing on a score of 431/7. Ramnaresh Sarwan made the highest score for the West Indians, retiring out on a score of 158. Auckland captain Jones said that they had batted for so long before declaring because he felt that the West Indies weren't going to push for a result either. West Indian fast bowler Fidel Edwards said that the pitch had been \"tiring to bowl on\" but was a good workout for the bowlers prior to the Test series.\nTest Series.\n1st Test.\nOn the day prior to the start of the first Test Jacob Oram suffered a calf strain and was unable to recover with Kyle Mills being flown in to replace him. Daniel Vettori won the toss for New Zealand and decided to bat first. The new opening partnership – New Zealand's 18th in 36 Tests – had only put on ten runs before Jamie How got out. Daniel Flynn and Tim McIntosh put on a partnership of 87 until McIntosh was dismissed after lunch followed by Ross Taylor falling to an injudicious shot. Flynn became the first New Zealander to be dismissed under the experimental review system, being given out LBW for 95; when bad light stopped play early, New Zealand were 226/4. There was no action on the second day of the match with the umpires calling off play due to rain. A further session was lost on the third day while the ground was dried, with play beginning at 2:45 pm (just over 3 hours after the scheduled start). Brendon McCullum and Jesse Ryder began well but were both dismissed shortly after the West Indies took the new ball. After some resistance from the final batsmen, New Zealand were dismissed for 365. The West Indian opening batsmen negotiated the 14 overs remaining in the day to be 39 without loss at stumps."

        "text": "The 38th Ryder Cup was held 1–4 October 2010 at the Celtic Manor Resort in Newport, Wales. It was the 17th time the Ryder Cup had been staged in Britain, but the first time in Wales. It was played on the newly constructed \"Twenty Ten\" course, specifically designed for the event. The team captains were Colin Montgomerie for Europe and Corey Pavin for the United States.\nWith the U.S. as the defending champion, Europe won by a score of 14 to 13 and regained the Cup. It was Europe's sixth victory in the last eight contests and their fourth consecutive home win. The event was plagued by bad weather with play having to be suspended twice. Having taken a 3-point lead into the singles matches Europe faced a U.S. fightback and the conclusion of the Ryder Cup 2010 went right down to the anchor match between Graeme McDowell and Hunter Mahan. Eventually McDowell defeated Mahan 3 &amp; 1 to regain the Cup for Europe.\nThe competition was officially opened by Carwyn Jones, First Minister for Wales.\nFormat.\nThe Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point. The original schedule in 2010 was:\nWith a total of 28 points, 14 points are required to win the Cup, and 14 points are required for the defending champion to retain the Cup. All matches were played to a maximum of 18 holes.\nIt was the second time in succession that the schedule for four-ball (better ball) and foursome (alternate shot) matches on Day One and Day Two has been changed, i.e. it was scheduled to be effectively the same timetable as was used in 2006.\nRevised format.\nAs a result of the long suspension of play on the first day due to heavy rain, the format for the rest of the competition was changed to try to bring a conclusion to the matches on Sunday. However, further heavy rain caused a delayed start on Sunday, so that the last of the revised sessions would be played on Monday. Because of the changes, there were a number of Ryder Cup firsts. For the first time in the history of the Ryder Cup, all 24 players took part in pairing sessions at the same time in six pairings (as opposed to the usual four pairings) and in another first for the event both foursome and four-ball matches were played in the same session at the same time. It is also the first time that the competition went into a fourth day. The revised schedule consisted of four sessions as opposed to the usual five.\nThe total number of each type of match remained the same, 8 four-ball, 8 foursomes, and 12 singles. By captains' agreement, matches would conclude at sundown Monday if not completed before then. Any matches still in progress would be considered halved at that point.\nTelevision.\nThe matches were covered live domestically on Sky Sports with daily highlights shown on the BBC.\nAll matches were covered live in the United States, a first for a Ryder Cup in Europe. ESPN handled Friday coverage. Mike Tirico and Paul Azinger hosted from the 18th tower, with Curtis Strange, Peter Alliss, and Sean McDonough calling holes, and on-course reporters Andy North, Billy Kratzert and Judy Rankin. Scott Van Pelt and Tom Weiskopf handled recaps during coverage. Most of ESPN's coverage was rained out on Friday, with a 7-hour rain delay during the middle of the day. NBC Sports covered the weekend action, with Dan Hicks and Johnny Miller hosting from the 18th tower, Gary Koch calling holes, and on-course reporters Mark Rolfing, Roger Maltbie, and Dottie Pepper. USA Network aired coverage of the singles live on Monday morning. The coverage was produced by corporate sibling NBC, with NBC's announcers being used on the telecast.\nTeam qualification and selection.\nEurope.\nThe European team consisted of:\nThere was much discussion about the qualification process after leading players based primarily in the United States, such as Paul Casey and Justin Rose, failed to make the team. As a result, the priority of the European and World lists was switched for the 2012 Ryder Cup.\nUnited States.\nThe United States team consisted of:\nThe team was finalised on 7 September when the four wildcards were announced.\nTeams.\nCaptains.\nThe team captains were Colin Montgomerie for Europe and Corey Pavin for the USA.\nVice-captains.\nEach captain selected a number of vice-captains to assist him during the tournament and to advise the players on the course.\nThe European vice-captains were Thomas Bjørn, Darren Clarke, Sergio García, Paul McGinley and José María Olazábal. Olazábal was added as a fifth vice-captain during the tournament, when the revised format meant that there were not enough vice-captains to cover all six matches simultaneously.\nThe USA vice-captains were Paul Goydos, Tom Lehman, Davis Love III and Jeff Sluman.\nPlayers.\nCaptains picks are shown in yellow; the world rankings and records are at the start of the 2010 Ryder Cup. Peter Hanson celebrated his 33rd birthday on the final day.\nCaptains picks are shown in yellow; the world rankings and records are at the start of the 2010 Ryder Cup.\nSession 1 (Friday and Saturday).\nFour-ball.\nFour-balls play on Friday began on schedule but was suspended at 9:43 am BST due to poor course conditions because of rain. Play was resumed at 5:00 pm as the water had drained off the course but was suspended again for the day just after 7 pm BST. Play was completed Saturday morning.\nSession 2 (Saturday).\nFoursomes.\nIn order to fit the intended number of matches into a schedule that had been condensed due to the weather, three sessions of four matches each were converted into 2 sessions of 6 matches each, requiring all 24 players to play during Sessions 2 and 3.\nSession 3 (Saturday and Sunday).\nFour-ball.\nPlay began in the third session on late Saturday afternoon. Team Europe was leading all six matches when darkness halted play. Start of play on Sunday was delayed until 13:20, due to severe weather overnight leaving running water on the fairways again.\nIndividual player records.\nEach entry refers to the win–loss–half record of the player.\nSource:\nOpening concert.\nA concert, dubbed 'Welcome to Wales', was held at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on 29 September 2010, two days prior to the beginning of the Ryder Cup. The event replaced a planned traditional gala dinner and was introduced by celebrities and golf stars. The concert featured musical performances by international superstars, and was hosted by Steve Jones.\nThe concert was headlined by Lostprophets, with Shirley Bassey, Katherine Jenkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Only Men Aloud! also featuring in the 90-minute televised event. The European and US golfers appeared on stage to greet the audience. It marked Bassey's first appearance in Wales for over 5 years.\nAwards.\nIn December 2010, BBC Sport named the Europe squad \"Team of The Year\"."

        "title": "Ice hockey in the United Kingdom",
        "text": "Ice hockey has been played in the United Kingdom since the beginning of the twentieth century, and it was a game between English Army veterans played in Canada that is the first recorded use of a sawed-off ball, which led to the use of the puck in hockey. The Great Britain men's national ice hockey team enjoyed worldwide success through the 1920s and 1930s, achieving bronze at the 1924 Olympics, and gold twelve years later. They also won medals at the World Championships in 1935, 1937 and 1938, though never won the tournament. The national team has struggled since the Second World War, and has not finished better than twelfth in the World Championships since 1962. Ice hockey is played professionally in the United Kingdom in the Elite Ice Hockey League, a ten team league which was founded in 2003.\nHistory.\nGeneral.\nPeople in Northern climates have played sports with sticks and balls on skates for centuries, but ice hockey as we know it today was developed in Canada during the early nineteenth century, having developed from elements derived from the already existing sports of hurling, shinty, lacrosse, and sports similar to field hockey. However, in its early development period, ice hockey in British North America, present day Canada, was a conglomeration of a number of similar ice skating games which were collectively called \"hockey on the ice\", a phenomenon which led to the creation of what is today known as bandy, though ice hockey developed in Canada while the early development bandy began largely in England. The earliest known, extant photograph of Bandy/ice Hockey in Britain is presumably of the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club team training on Christ Church Meadow.\nBandy is considered the forerunner to ice hockey and was first identified to have been organized in Britain with English speed skater and fen skater, Charles Goodman Tebbutt who was also responsible for the creating the first published set of rules for bandy in 1882. Bury Fen, near Bluntisham, was the home of the Bury Fen Bandy Club (unbeaten for a century) where under the captaincy of Charles G. Tebbutt and his brothers (grandsons of Potto Brown's milling partner Joseph Goodman) the Bury Fen Bandy Club became responsible for formulating most of the rules of modern bandy and introducing the game into the Netherlands and other Northern European countries as well as other parts of Britain.\nToday the word \"bandy\" is used rather than \"hockey on the ice\" or \"ice hockey\" in order to avoid confusion between the two ice skating sports. Bandy in all its forms disappeared from North America by the early 1900s after it had been absorbed into the new organized sport of ice hockey, but continued to develop in Russia and Scandinavia. Today, bandy is dominated internationally by Russia and Sweden. Meanwhile bandy is almost entirely extinct from Britain today and is played mostly as a type of cult sport in certain parts of the country, though efforts are being made to develop men's and women's national teams to compete in the international bandy competitions organized by the Federation of International Bandy. Today bandy in the United Kingdom is governed by the Great Britain Bandy Association (GBBA), formerly called the Bandy Federation of England and later the England Bandy Federation.\nIn early North America, indigenous persons are known to have played a type of field hockey which involved a type of \"puck\" or ball, and curved wooden sticks. It was first observed by Europeans being played by Mi'kmaqs in Nova Scotia during the late 17th century where it was called \"ricket\" by the Mi'kmaqs. It is considered possible that elements from these games were also involved in influencing the early development of ice hockey along with other existing games and sports, though in what manner and to what degree remains unclear.\nThe sport of ice hockey was originally played with a stick and ball, largely influenced by the British import of bandy, but in 1860 a group of English veterans from the Royal Canadian Rifle Regiment played a game in Kingston, Ontario, utilising a sliced, flattened ball, a precursor to the modern puck, for what is believed to be the first time. This use of a puck in this match, played on the frozen harbour by the city, was a significant step towards the modern game of hockey, as a flat puck acts quite differently to a round ball, changing the dynamics of the game.\n The game developed quickly in Canada, and in the late nineteenth century, Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby purchased a decorative punch bowl from a London silversmith to award to the leading amateur side in the country: this became known as the Stanley Cup.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIt was previously believed that in 1885 the first game of European ice hockey was played between Oxford University and their traditional rival Cambridge in the first Ice Hockey Varsity Match in St. Moritz, Switzerland. However, the first game is undocumented as the first photographs and team lists the date from 1895. The match was won by the Oxford Dark Blues, 6–0. Today there is no contemporary evidence that this match took place, and Oxford now claims that this was a bandy match.\nIn the United Kingdom, a five-team league was in operation in England in 1903; the first in Europe. The league was contested at two rinks in London: the Prince's Skating Club in Knightsbridge and Hengler's Ice Rink in the City of Westminster. It was won by the London Canadians. The first game to be played in Scotland occurred five years later in Crossmyloof, Glasgow. The same year saw the creation of the International Ice Hockey Federation, of which Great Britain was a founding member. The British Ice Hockey Association was set up in 1914, and continued until 1999, when it was replaced by Ice Hockey UK.\nThe sport enjoyed an increase in interest in the 1980s, primarily in North East England and Scotland, where local clubs were at the forefront of the British Hockey League. Its popularity rose further in the 1990s, when teams like the Sheffield Steelers and Manchester Storm were established, who had big, American-styled arenas and drew large crowds of up to 8,000 on average and up to 17,000 in single games, with the Manchester Storm holding the record for a British league game when they sold out Manchester Arena with 17,245 people on 23 February 1997. In the early 2000s, the Nottingham Panthers and Belfast Giants also managed to draw large crowds. In order to take British ice hockey to the next level a new, more professional, top-tier league, the Ice Hockey Superleague, was established in 1996. However, after a number of clubs withdrew from the league while others folded, the league was disbanded and replaced by the considerably more low-profile Elite Ice Hockey League in 2003, resulting in a decrease in attendance during the mid- to late 2000s.\nDuring the 2010s, the league recovered and the popularity of ice hockey rose again, with ice hockey now being considered the United Kingdom's biggest indoor sport and fastest-growing winter sport.\nMen's Leagues.\nEIHL.\nThe Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL) was formed in 2003 following the demise of the Ice Hockey Superleague and it is the highest level of ice hockey competition in the United Kingdom.\nThe league currently consists of ten teams, with representation from all four nations of the United Kingdom – the only league in any sport to do so. In fourteen completed seasons the league has been won by five different teams.\nNIHL.\nThe National Ice Hockey League (NIHL) is a set of semi-professional ice hockey leagues administered by the English Ice Hockey Association which currently form the second to fourth tiers of British ice hockey, below the Elite Ice Hockey League. Formerly called the English National Ice Hockey League (ENIHL), it was renamed in 2012 to recognise the inclusion of several teams from Scotland and Wales.\nThe league is split into two regions, North and South, meaning teams do not have to travel long distances for away games. Each region has 2 divisions, with rules on promotion and relegation between the divisions in each region changing regularly.\nNational Teams.\nMen.\nThe British national ice hockey team (also known as Team GB) was a founding member of the International Ice Hockey Federation in 1908.\nThe team appeared on the international scene in the early 20th century, winning the first ever IIHF European Championship in 1910, finishing as bronze medallists at the 1924 Winter Olympics, and becoming Olympic champions in 1936.\nHowever, since then the national team has made little impact on the sport and Great Britain last qualified for the Olympics in 1948. The team's performances have increased in recent years, and in 2018, it managed to be promoted to the top division of the Ice Hockey World Championship for the first time since 1994. The Under 18 and Under 20 British teams also enjoyed success in 2018 with the former gaining promotion to group B of division I in the IIHF World U18 Championship whilst the latter finished third in their respective age category.\nWomen.\nThe British women's national ice hockey team was founded in 1989 and competed in the IIHF European Championships until 1996. Since then the team has competed in the IIHF World Women's Championships finishing in 23rd place (2nd in Division IIA) in 2018. They currently sit 23rd in the world rankings just one place lower than their male counterparts. The team has never qualified for the Olympics. However, the number of British female players has nearly doubled since 2011 to 889 eligible players as of 2019.\nMedia.\nIce hockey receives little national media coverage in the United Kingdom. Some national newspapers list results and provide short summaries of the league's news but more extensive coverage remains minimal.\nOn 20 July 2018 the EIHL agreed a two-year deal with FreeSports to broadcast one live EIHL game every two weeks, alongside a pre-season preview show, highlights package, and live coverage of the end of season play-off final. The coverage, which is available via Freeview (ch95), Sky (ch422), Virgin (ch553) FreeSat (ch252), TalkTalk (ch95), BT Vision (ch95) and online via the TVPlayer, will be fronted by Aaron Murphy who previously commentated on the league for Premier Sports.\nCoverage in the towns and cities where ice hockey clubs are based is more extensive, and local newspapers have dedicated ice hockey reporters who cover the local team. Local radio stations such as BBC Coventry &amp; Warwickshire, BBC Radio Nottingham and BBC Radio Sheffield all provide programming on the sport. Radio Sheffield also provides a weekly ice hockey programme \"Iceline\" while Radio Nottingham has broadcast a similar programme, \"Powerplay\" since the later stages of the 2005–06 season, and has a 15-minute weekly preview of games on a Saturday evening during the ice hockey season after the station's coverage of the local football teams is completed. BBC Coventry &amp; Warwickshire have also followed suit with \"Faceoff\", a programme broadcast on the first Thursday of the month during the season.\nThe BBC shows extensive coverage of the sport during the Winter Olympics."

        "text": "Ice hockey in Russia is one of the most popular sports in the country.\nHistory.\nIn 1908, representatives of Russian ice hockey received an invitation to visit Paris to discuss the possibility of uniting hockey fans, along with France, Great Britain, Switzerland, Belgium, and Germany. On 15 May 1908, the First Congress of the International Ice Hockey Federation was formed without Russia and Germany.\nThe Russian Hockey Federation was added to the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG) (as the IIHF was known then) on 12 February 1911, as the seventh member.\nThe USSR ice hockey championship began to be played out in 1946. At first, the All-Union hockey section was organizing the championships. Since 1 July 1959, the organization has become known as the USSR Hockey Federation, which has united the leadership of hockey with the ball and hockey with the puck. On 17 October 1967, the Federation was divided into the Federation of Ice Hockey (USSR) and the USSR Ice Hockey Federation.\nNominally hockey in Russia was engaged in the Federation of Hockey Russian SFSR, formed in 1959. The Federation of Hockey of the Russian SFSR / Russia (FHR) was established on 12 November 1991. On 19 January 1992, the FHR officially became the successor to the USSR Hockey Federation.\nOn 22 May 1992, former Soviet player Vladimir Petrov was elected president of the FHR. On 8 April 1994, Petrov was removed from the post of president, Valentin Sych was elected the new president. On 21 April 1997, the president of FHR, Valentin Sych was killed. On 30 May 1997, Alexander Steblin was elected the new president. On 21 April 2006, Steblin resigned, and former legendary Soviet goaltender three-time Olympic champion Vladislav Tretiak was elected president of the FHR.\nDomestic League.\nOn 26 March 2009, at the joint meeting of the clubs of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), the Russian Hockey Federation and the leadership of the KHL, the Youth Hockey League.\nOn 23 March 2010, at the joint meeting of the clubs of the Higher League, the leadership of the Russian Hockey Federation and the Kontinental Hockey League created the Higher Hockey League.\nOn 21 August 2015, at an extraordinary conference of the FHR, decisions were made on changes in the structure of the management of the Federation. Instead of the FHR Council and the executive committee of the FHR, the Federation Board was established. Arkady Rotenberg was elected chairman of the board.\nIce hockey was further popularized by Canadians introduced to the Soviet Union in 1932. During the Soviet Union period the Soviet Championship League was the premier ice hockey league. After the fall of communism it was followed by the Russian Superleague and then the Kontinental Hockey League.\nAnatoly Tarasov is considered the father of Russian ice hockey.\nNational team.\nThe Soviet Union entered its first Winter Olympics tournament in 1956, and was successful from the start, much due to the players having an earlier experience of bandy, also called \"Russian hockey\". The Soviet Union would dominate the hockey world championship and Olympic tournaments from the 1950s to 1980s. The Soviet Union enjoyed a position where it could use its best players while Canada and many others were barred from doing that as their players were classified as professionals.\nDuring the height of the Cold War in the 1980s, many Russian hockey players defected to the United States to play in the National Hockey League (NHL) with such notable players as Viacheslav Fetisov, Alexander Mogilny, and Sergei Federov.\nOn the international stage, Russia considers Canada its major hockey rival.\nDuring this period the Russian national team, having won the 1993 World Championship, for a long time remained without medals at all. And only in recent years, the Russian team began to return its former strength. And if at the World Championships in Moscow in 2007 Russians stumbled in the semifinals, then in 2008, the year of the official 100th anniversary of hockey, they regained the title of world champions after defeating the Canadians in Quebec. A dramatic final match, during which Russia lost 2: 4, ended in victory in overtime with a score of 5: 4. A year later at the 2009 championship in Bern, the Russian team confirmed its title, again defeating the national team of Canada in the final with a score of 2: 1.\nAt the 2010 World Championships, held in Cologne, the Russian team took only second place, losing in the finals of the Czech team with a score of 1: 2. In 2012, the Russian team won gold for the fourth time. In 2014, she became a five-time champion, winning all of her matches, like in 2008, 2009 and 2012. In the final match, the Russian team defeated the Finnish national team with a score of 5: 2.\nRussian hockey differs from Russian football in the development of regional clubs. On the map of Russia there are strong in the economic and organizational plan hockey centers: Novosibirsk, Omsk, Magnitogorsk, Yaroslavl, Ufa, Kazan, Chelyabinsk.\nAfter the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the International Ice Hockey Federation suspended Russia and Belarus from all levels of competition."

        "title": "2009 World Series",
        "text": "The 2009 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2009 season. As the 105th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff contested between the Philadelphia Phillies, champions of the National League (NL) and defending World Series champions, and the New York Yankees, champions of the American League (AL). The Yankees defeated the Phillies, 4 games to 2, winning their 27th World Series championship. \nThe series was played between October 28 and November 4, broadcast on Fox, and watched by an average of roughly 19 million viewers. Home field advantage for the Series went to the AL for the eighth straight year as a result of its 4–3 win in the All-Star Game. The Phillies earned their berth into the playoffs by winning the National League East. The Yankees won the American League East to earn their berth, posting the best record in the Major Leagues. The Phillies reached the World Series by defeating the Colorado Rockies in the best-of-five National League Division Series and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the best-of-seven NL Championship Series (NLCS). The Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins in the American League Division Series and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the AL Championship Series (ALCS) to advance to their first World Series since 2003. As a result of their loss, the Phillies became the first team since the Yankees to lose the World Series after winning it the previous year. As of 2023, this is the most recent World Series to feature a defending champion. \nCliff Lee pitched a complete game in the Phillies' Game 1 victory, allowing only one unearned run, while Chase Utley hit two home runs. In Game 2, solo home runs by Mark Teixeira and Hideki Matsui helped the Yankees win by a score of 3–1. After a rain delayed start, Game 3 featured more offense, with a combined six home runs and thirteen total runs en route to a Yankee victory. The Yankees won Game 4 by scoring the decisive three runs in the ninth inning after an alert base running play by Johnny Damon. The Phillies avoided elimination with a win in Game 5, aided by Utley's second two–home run game of the series. The Yankees secured their World Series championship with a Game 6 victory in which Matsui hit his third home run of the series. He was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the series, making him the first Japanese-born player and the first full-time designated hitter to win the award. Matsui was the series' MVP despite starting only the three games that were played at Yankee Stadium, since the designated hitter position was not used in NL ballparks at the time.\nSeveral records were tied, extended, or broken during this World Series, including team championships (Yankees with 27), career postseason wins (Andy Pettitte with 18), career World Series saves (Mariano Rivera with 11), home runs in a World Series (Utley with five), strikeouts by a hitter in a World Series (Ryan Howard with 13), and runs batted in in a single World Series game (Matsui with six).\nTeams.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nDuring the off-season, the Phillies promoted assistant general manager Rubén Amaro Jr. to general manager, succeeding Pat Gillick who retired at the end of a three-year contract. Their most notable offseason player change was in left field, as Pat Burrell departed due to free agency and was replaced by free agent Raúl Ibañez. Another notable acquisition was free agent pitcher Chan Ho Park. Park was originally signed as a backup option for the bullpen, as reliever J. C. Romero was assigned a 50-game suspension after violating the Major League Baseball drug policy, but Park won the fifth starter's job in Spring Training.\nIn July 2009, Phillies scouts evaluated pitcher Pedro Martínez in two simulated games against the Phillies DSL team, leading to a one-year, $1-million contract. Replacing Jamie Moyer as a starter in the Phillies rotation on August 12, 2009, Philadelphia won each of Martínez's first seven starts, the first time in franchise history that this had occurred with any debuting Phillies pitcher. The Phillies made one large acquisition at the trade deadline, trading four minor league players to the Cleveland Indians for pitcher Cliff Lee and outfielder Ben Francisco. Lee won seven of his 12 regular season starts for Philadelphia in 2009.\nDuring the regular season, the Phillies led the National League East for most of the year, taking first place for good on May 30. Ibáñez had started the year strongly, batting well over .300 with 17 home runs and 46 runs batted in (RBI) in the first two months of the season, which led the \"New York Post\" to call him an \"early MVP candidate\". He was placed on the disabled list in mid-June for a groin injury, however, and though he returned he did not bat above .260 for any other month that season. Although Ibáñez did not receive MVP votes his teammates Ryan Howard and Chase Utley had successful years, finishing 3rd and 8th in the balloting respectively. The Phillies finished the season with a record of 93–69 (.574), six games above the second-place Florida Marlins in their division.\nThe second-seeded Phillies defeated the wild card Colorado Rockies in the National League Division Series (NLDS), three games to one, advancing to the National League Championship Series (NLCS). Facing the Los Angeles Dodgers again, making the first NLCS rematch in back-to-back years since 2004-05 series, when Houston faced St. Louis, and the 3rd LCS rematch in back-to-back years since 2000 (the other in the 2003-04 ALCS between New York and Boston), the Phillies won the NLCS, four games to one, becoming the first team to repeat as National League champions since the 1995–96 Atlanta Braves. Ryan Howard won the NLCS MVP for his strong offensive performance during the series. Howard tied Lou Gehrig's postseason record by having at least one RBI in eight straight games across the NLDS and NLCS. They became the first World Series champion to return to the World Series the following year since the 2000–01 New York Yankees.\nNew York Yankees.\nThe Yankees' offseason began in November 2008 with control over their organization shifting from long-time owner George Steinbrenner to his son Hal Steinbrenner. Notable player departures included Mike Mussina—who announced his retirement on November 20, 2008—as well as Bobby Abreu, Jason Giambi, and Carl Pavano, who all left as free agents. Notable free agent acquisitions included starting pitchers CC Sabathia and A. J. Burnett and first baseman Mark Teixeira. Another major addition was outfielder Nick Swisher, acquired in a trade with the Chicago White Sox.\nThe Yankees played the 2009 season in \"New\" Yankee Stadium, their first year in that park after playing for 84 years in \"Old\" Yankee Stadium. They won the American League East with an eight-game lead over their rivals, the Boston Red Sox, compiling a record of 103–59. Sabathia won 19 games and position players Alex Rodriguez and Teixeira both had strong seasons offensively, Rodriguez with 30 home runs and 100 RBI and Teixeira with 39 and 122 respectively. Closing pitcher Mariano Rivera earned his 500th save against the Yankees' cross-town rival New York Mets, becoming the second pitcher in history to do so. On September 11, 2009, shortstop Derek Jeter recorded his 2,722nd career hit, passing Lou Gehrig to become the all-time leader in career hits recorded as a Yankee.\nThe top-seeded Yankees defeated the third-seeded Minnesota Twins in three games in the American League Division Series and the second-seeded Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in six games in the American League Championship Series (ALCS) to win their first American League pennant since 2003. Sabathia was named MVP of the ALCS with two wins in the series. The Yankees' victory in the ALCS earned them their 40th World Series appearance in franchise history, and their first since losing to the Florida Marlins in .\nSeries preview.\nThe two teams played a three-game interleague series at Yankee Stadium in May 2009, with the defending World Series champion Phillies winning two of the three games. The series included two blown saves by Phillies' closer Brad Lidge in games 2 and 3, although the Phillies came back to win the final game in extra innings.\nThe Yankees had home field advantage for the Series as the American League had won that year's All-Star Game, a year after the \"Old\" Yankee Stadium hosted the 2008 All-Star Game. The team match-up was heavily discussed and analyzed in the media prior to the beginning of the series. Both teams' offensive lineups were heavily touted, with the Yankees and Phillies leading their respective leagues in runs scored per game. Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez drew particular focus in the media for his success in earlier rounds of the 2009 playoffs in contrast to past postseason performances. The two lineups featured 20 former All-Stars and three former MVP award winners. Only one regular starter between both teams, Phillies catcher Carlos Ruiz, did not have at least ten home runs during the 2009 regular season. The two teams combined for 468 home runs during the season, more than any pair of opponents in World Series history.\nThe pitching staffs were also the subject of significant discussion prior to the series. The starting pitchers for Game 1, CC Sabathia and Cliff Lee, were regarded as aces who dominated the 2009 postseason with a 0.96 earned run average (ERA) between them. This matchup was of particular note, as Sabathia and Lee were former teammates from the Cleveland Indians and each had won a Cy Young Award with that franchise. Yankees manager Joe Girardi had been using a three-man starting rotation during the playoffs, in contrast to the four-pitcher rotation used by the Phillies. This difference led \"USA Today\" to give the Phillies' starting rotation the \"edge\" in the series, as the World Series had one fewer day off than previous rounds of the playoffs, making the series less conducive to using a three-man rotation. Gene Wojciechowski of ESPN criticized Girardi's strategy, arguing that Chad Gaudin should have pitched in Game 5 or 6, instead of A. J. Burnett or Andy Pettitte on reduced, three days' rest. Wojciechowski argued that while Sabathia had proven his ability to pitch on shorter rest, Burnett and Pettitte should have been given their regular time between starts. Burnett had drawn some criticism, as he performed poorly in his last appearance before the World Series, a start in Game 5 of the ALCS in which he allowed six runs over six innings. However, Burnett had previously been successful on short rest, going 4–0 with a 2.33 ERA in four career starts on short rest before this game. Some believed Girardi settled on a three-man rotation because he had limited options for a fourth starting pitcher, either Gaudin or Joba Chamberlain, who had been inconsistent as starters in the regular season and had been shifted into the bullpen for the postseason.\nThe matchup of closers, Mariano Rivera and Brad Lidge, also drew attention. Rivera and Lidge were the only closers who had not blown a save during the 2009 postseason, whereas closers on other postseason teams blew 11 saves in the 24 postseason games before the World Series. Both had performed well during the postseason, but Lidge had posted a 7.21 ERA during the 2009 regular season, in contrast to Rivera's 1.76. Lidge's 2009 numbers were in stark contrast to the previous season (41 out of 41 save opportunities, a 1.95 ERA, and 92 strikeouts in 62 games). As a result, \"USA Today\" gave the Yankees the edge, noting that Lidge had blown two saves against the Yankees during their regular season series earlier that year.\nBackground.\nThe Series started on October 28, 2009, which was the latest start in World Series history, beating the previous record held by the 2001 World Series (October 27). Game 4 was played on Sunday, November 1 and the series-winning Game 6 took place on November 4. The Series was only the third to end in a month other than October. The first came in , which was played entirely in September after the regular season was cut short due to World War I. The other such series was in 2001, when the September 11 attacks caused a delay in the baseball season that eventually forced the end of the World Series into November.\nEarlier in the season Commissioner Bud Selig expressed interest in scheduling a World Series game during daylight hours instead of the evening. The starting times were ultimately moved before 8 p.m. ET for the first time in 30 years, but no day games were played. The Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL) played across the street from Citizens Bank Park at Lincoln Financial Field on the day of Game 4. The NFL moved that game's kickoff time to 1 p.m. to avoid it ending too close to the start of Game 4. Similarly, Game 5 was played at Citizens Bank Park on the same day as the Philadelphia Flyers hosted the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League (NHL) at the Wachovia Center. The opening faceoff of the hockey game was scheduled for 7 p.m. but the NHL moved it to 5 p.m. to avoid conflict.\nThe umpires for the series were Joe West, Dana DeMuth, Gerry Davis, Brian Gorman, Jeff Nelson and Mike Everitt. The World Series crew had included at least 1 umpire who had never worked the World Series in 24 of the past 25 series; however, following several mistakes by umpires in earlier rounds of the playoffs, this crew did not.\nThe Phillies had won the previous season's World Series against the Tampa Bay Rays for the franchise's second championship. The Yankees had lost their previous World Series appearance to the Florida Marlins in and had not won since against the New York Mets. This was the fifth Series played between teams from New York and Philadelphia, and was the first Yankees–Phillies matchup since . The series also was the fourth consecutive time that the Phillies would have faced a team from the current AL East in the World Series, while the Yankees had faced a NL East opponent in four of their five most recent World Series appearances.\nThis Series had two unofficial nicknames: \"Turnpike Series\", for the New Jersey Turnpike, which connects New York to Philadelphia through the state of New Jersey, and \"Liberty Series\", based on the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia and the Statue of Liberty in New York.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nFirst Lady Michelle Obama and Second Lady Jill Biden escorted former Yankees catcher and World War II veteran Yogi Berra to the mound, where the ceremonial first pitch was thrown by a veteran of the Iraq War. The Phillies' Ryan Howard got the first hit of the 2009 World Series by doubling in the first inning. Howard was stranded in the first and the game was scoreless after two innings. The Phillies scored first with a two-out home run by Chase Utley in the top of the third inning. Through the first five innings, Philadelphia starting pitcher Cliff Lee allowed no runs and three hits, striking out seven Yankees batters. In the top of the sixth, Utley hit another home run to give the Phillies a 2–0 lead. The starting pitchers Lee and CC Sabathia continued to pitch until the top of the eighth when Sabathia was replaced by Phil Hughes. Hughes walked the first two batters and was replaced by Dámaso Marte. Marte got two quick outs and was relieved by David Robertson, who walked Jayson Werth and gave up a two-run single to Raúl Ibañez. The Phillies added two more runs in the ninth with an RBI single by Shane Victorino and an RBI double by Howard. Lee finished with a complete game allowing one unearned run on six hits and striking out ten batters, not walking any of the hitters he faced.\nLee's pitching performance made history in several ways:\nGame 2.\nPrior to the game, Jay-Z and Alicia Keys performed the song \"Empire State of Mind\" for the Yankee Stadium crowd, while John Legend performed the national anthem. This game marked the first postseason appearance of Pedro Martínez against the Yankees since the 2004 American League Championship Series, when he was with the Boston Red Sox and a part of the two teams' long standing rivalry; it was also the second-ever World Series start that Martínez made. There was much media interest in Martínez's \"return to Yankee Stadium\" for Game 2, as he told reporters at a pre-game press conference \"When you have 60,000 people chanting your name, waiting for you to throw the ball, you have to consider yourself someone special, someone that really has a purpose out there.\"\nThe Phillies scored first for the second game in a row, with Raúl Ibañez hitting a ground rule double and then scoring on a Matt Stairs RBI single off A. J. Burnett in the second inning.\nMark Teixeira tied the game with a home run in the fourth inning, and Hideki Matsui broke the tie in the sixth with another homer. Martínez departed the game after giving up consecutive hits to Jerry Hairston Jr. and Melky Cabrera to start the seventh inning, and reliever Chan Ho Park gave up an RBI single to Jorge Posada. With Cabrera at second base and Posada at first, Johnny Damon hit a low line drive at Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard. Howard grabbed the ball and threw to second where Posada was tagged and called out while standing on the base. First-base umpire Brian Gorman ruled that Howard had caught the ball in the air; thus, the result was an inning-ending double play. Both Posada and Joe Girardi vehemently protested the call, claiming that the batted ball had hit the ground before being caught; however, the umpires did not reverse the call. ESPN reported that Gorman blew the call. This was the first of two calls made by Gorman in Game Two that were heavily criticized.\nBurnett left the game after seven innings, having given up one run. He was replaced by Mariano Rivera in the eighth inning. With one out in the eighth, the Phillies put two runners on with a walk to Jimmy Rollins and a single by Shane Victorino. However, Chase Utley grounded into an inning-ending double play ending on a close play at first base. The play was the second disputed call made by umpire Brian Gorman in Game Two. Gorman himself later admitted he missed this call, saying, \"on a freeze frame, it looks like there's a little bit of a ball outside [Teixeira's] glove when [Utley] hits the bag.\" Ultimately, Rivera threw 39 pitches and got six outs for his 38th postseason save, his tenth in World Series play. \n Burnett earned the win in Game Two.\nGame 3.\nThe start of the game was postponed 80 minutes due to a rain delay, pushing the start time to 9:17 p.m. Amber Riley, accompanied by cast members of the television series \"Glee\" (Jenna Ushkowitz. Chris Colfer, Lea Michele, Cory Monteith, Mark Salling, Dianna Agron, and Kevin McHale) performed the national anthem, as part of a ceremony featuring a large American flag and several members of the armed services. The Phillies scored first with Jayson Werth's lead-off home run, which was followed by a bases-loaded walk and a sacrifice fly to make the score 3–0 in the bottom of the second inning. Following Mark Teixeira's walk in the top of the fourth inning, Alex Rodriguez hit a deep ball down the right field line. It was originally ruled a double so Teixeira held at third base. The play was reviewed using MLB instant replay, which revealed that the ball had struck a camera sticking over the top of the wall, so the ball was ruled a two-run home run, giving Rodriguez his first World Series hit. This was the first home run reviewed by instant replay in postseason play. Specifically, the ball hit a camera owned by Fox and MLB which extended slightly over the right field wall. The camera was moved back for Game 4 such that its lens was in line with the wall. Coincidentally, Alex Rodriguez also had the first regular season home run reviewed by replay.\nNick Swisher opened the top of the fifth inning with a double and scored on a single to center field by Andy Pettitte. This was Pettitte's first career postseason RBI and the first RBI by a Yankees pitcher in a World Series since Jim Bouton in 1964. Derek Jeter followed Pettitte with another single, and both runners scored on a two-run double by Johnny Damon. Cole Hamels then walked Teixeira and was relieved by J. A. Happ. Happ closed out the fifth without allowing further scoring, but Nick Swisher added to the Yankees lead with a home run off of him in the sixth. Werth hit his second home run of the game leading off the bottom of the sixth to close the Yankees lead to 6–4, becoming the second Phillies player to hit multiple home runs in this World Series.\nChad Durbin relieved Happ in the top of the seventh. He walked Johnny Damon, who then stole second base. Rodriguez was then hit by a pitch, and Damon scored on a single by Jorge Posada. Joba Chamberlain relieved Pettitte in the bottom of the seventh and retired the side in order. Brett Myers retired the first two batters in the top of the eighth, but Hideki Matsui then hit a home run pinch hitting for Chamberlain. Phil Hughes pitched a third of an inning in the bottom of the ninth and allowed a solo home run to Carlos Ruiz before being relieved by Mariano Rivera. Rivera closed out the game, throwing just five pitches to record the final two outs. This game was Pettitte's 17th career postseason win, extending his MLB record.\nGame 4.\nThis game marked the second time the World Series was held during November. Prior to the start of the game, Derek Jeter and Albert Pujols were named winners of the Hank Aaron Award for their offensive performances in 2009. This was the first game to test manager Joe Girardi's decision to use a three-man starting rotation, as CC Sabathia started the game on three days rest, a shorter period than he normally got during the regular season. Jeter led the game off with a single and advanced to third base on a double by Johnny Damon. Jeter scored via a Mark Teixeira ground out and Alex Rodriguez was hit by a pitch. Rodriguez was hit twice the night before and the umpires issued warnings to both benches. Jorge Posada then added to the Yankees lead that inning with a sacrifice fly. The Phillies answered quickly, scoring a run on successive doubles by Shane Victorino and Chase Utley in the bottom of the first. Sabathia intentionally walked Jayson Werth, but escaped the inning without further scoring. The Phillies tied the game in the bottom of the fourth as Ryan Howard singled, stole second, and scored on a single by Pedro Feliz. Although the run counted, instant replay of Howard's slide showed that he did not touch home plate. As Sabathia threw to second base, Mike Everitt signaled that Howard was safe due to the attempted play on Feliz. Sabathia then pitched to Carlos Ruiz as part of an intentional walk, therefore losing the right to appeal that Howard missed home.\nNick Swisher walked to lead off the fifth inning and advanced to second on a Melky Cabrera single. Swisher restored the Yankees' lead, scoring on a single by Jeter, and Cabrera added to it by scoring a run on a Damon single. Brett Gardner replaced Cabrera in center field as a defensive substitution in the bottom of the sixth inning after Cabrera left the game due to a hamstring injury. Chan Ho Park relieved Phillies starter Joe Blanton in the seventh and held the Yankees scoreless in that inning. Chase Utley hit his third home run of the series in the bottom of the seventh with two outs, bringing the game to 4–3. Dámaso Marte relieved Sabathia and got the final out of the seventh without further scoring.\nRyan Madson relieved Park in the eighth and allowed a walk and a single but held the Yankees scoreless. Joba Chamberlain replaced Marte in the bottom of the inning. He struck out the first two batters he faced but allowed a game-tying home run to Feliz before closing the inning.\nBrad Lidge came into the game for the ninth inning, popping out Matsui and striking out Jeter before surrendering a two-out single to Damon—after a nine-pitch at bat with two strikes and four foul balls. Then, with Teixeira batting, Damon stole second and, on the same play, also stole third as the base was uncovered due to a defensive shift against Teixeira. Several news outlets referred to this as a \"mad dash\". Some believed that Damon's play caused Lidge to avoid throwing his best pitch—a slider with sharp downward movement—for the rest of the inning, as it risked a wild pitch that would have allowed Damon to score from third base. Teixeira was then hit by a pitch and Rodriguez put the Yankees ahead with a double, scoring Damon. Posada added to that lead with a single that scored Teixeira and Rodriguez, but was thrown out at second to end the inning. Mariano Rivera entered in the bottom of the ninth and saved the game for the Yankees on eight pitches for his second save of the series.\nGame 5.\nCanadian singer Alanis Morissette sang the national anthem. The Yankees replaced Melky Cabrera on their postseason roster with Ramiro Peña due to his injury in Game 4, while Brett Gardner took Cabrera's place in center field. A. J. Burnett, the Yankees' Game 2 starter, started Game 5 on three days rest, one less than the Phillies' Cliff Lee. The Yankees scored first in the first inning, with Johnny Damon reaching base with a single and then scoring on a two-out double by Alex Rodriguez. The Phillies responded in the bottom of the inning with a single by Jimmy Rollins, Shane Victorino reaching after being hit by a pitch, and finally a three-run home run by Chase Utley to take the lead. The Phillies added to their lead in the third inning with Utley and Ryan Howard drawing walks followed by RBI singles by Jayson Werth and Raúl Ibañez. With no outs in the inning, Burnett was relieved by David Robertson, who allowed another run to score on a Carlos Ruiz ground out.\nRobertson held the Phillies scoreless for a second inning in the fourth. Jorge Posada entered as a pinch hitter in the fifth inning for José Molina and grounded out. Eric Hinske then pinch hit for Robertson and walked, advanced to third on a Derek Jeter single, and scored on a ground out by Damon. Alfredo Aceves entered as the new Yankee pitcher in the bottom of the fifth. The first batter he faced, Jayson Werth, hit a deep drive to center field but it was caught for an out by Gardner, who collided with the outfield wall to complete the play. Aceves completed the inning without a run scoring, inducing ground outs from Ibáñez and Ruiz. Phil Coke relieved Aceves in the seventh inning and allowed two Phillies players to tie World Series records. First, Utley tied Reggie Jackson's record for most home runs in a World Series with a home run, his fifth of the series. Coke then struck out Howard, Howard's 12th strikeout in the series, tying Willie Wilson's record for most strikeouts in a World Series. Finally, Coke was driven from the game after allowing another home run, this time to Ibáñez, and was relieved by Phil Hughes.\nVictorino was replaced defensively in the eighth inning by Ben Francisco. Lee was driven from the game after allowing a single to Damon, followed by a double by Mark Teixeira, and then a double by Rodriguez that scored both runners. Chan Ho Park relieved Lee and induced a ground out from Nick Swisher, which advanced Rodriguez to third base. Rodriguez scored on a sacrifice fly by Robinson Canó. Ryan Madson entered in the ninth to close the game, allowing a double to Posada and a single to Hideki Matsui without recording an out. Batting with men on first and third base, Jeter grounded into a double play, allowing Posada to score but emptying the bases. Damon singled to bring Teixeira to bat as the potential tying run, but Madson struck him out to record his first World Series save. Members of the news media, such as Gene Wojciechowski, were critical of the three-man starting rotation strategy following Game 3, and contended that Burnett's poor performance was caused by insufficient rest in between starts. However, Burnett had been successful up to this point in such situations, going 4–0 with a 2.33 ERA in four career starts on short rest (less than the normal four days between starts) before this game.\nGame 6.\nThis game was the first Game 6 in a World Series since the 2003 World Series six years earlier, the longest such gap in the history of the World Series. Mary J. Blige, a Bronx native, performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". Andy Pettitte started on three days rest, the third straight game in which the Yankees fielded a pitcher on short rest. The Phillies started Pedro Martínez, who called himself and opposing pitcher Andy Pettitte \"old goats\" and acknowledged that Red Sox fans were rooting for him: \"I know that they don't like the Yankees to win, not even in Nintendo games.\"\nThe Yankees scored first with an Alex Rodriguez walk opening the bottom of the second inning followed by a two-run home run by designated hitter Hideki Matsui. The Phillies quickly responded with a triple by Carlos Ruiz who then scored on a sacrifice fly from Jimmy Rollins in the top of the third. Matsui answered back, adding to the Yankees lead again with a single with the bases loaded in the bottom of the third, scoring Derek Jeter and Johnny Damon. Damon, injured running the bases while scoring, was replaced defensively in the top of the fourth by Jerry Hairston Jr.\nPhillies starter Pedro Martínez was removed after allowing four runs in four innings, relieved in the fifth by Chad Durbin. Durbin allowed a ground rule double to Jeter, who advanced to third on a sacrifice bunt by Hairston and scored on a single by Mark Teixeira. Durbin then hit Rodriguez with a pitch and was relieved by J. A. Happ after recording just one out. Happ allowed a two-run double to Matsui, his fifth and sixth RBI of the game, which tied a World Series record for most RBI in a single game set by Bobby Richardson in the 1960 World Series.\nThe Phillies made the game closer in the top of the sixth inning, as Chase Utley drew a walk and Ryan Howard followed him with a two-run home run, bringing the score to 7–3. After Raúl Ibañez hit a double into right field, Joba Chamberlain relieved Andy Pettitte and closed the sixth without allowing the Phillies to score. Chan Ho Park came in for Happ, ending any Yankees threat that inning. Chamberlain was relieved by Dámaso Marte in the top of the seventh after allowing two baserunners, but Marte struck out Utley to end the inning scoreless. After Park allowed a single to Rodriguez, Scott Eyre replaced him. Eyre allowed Rodriguez to steal second and intentionally walked Jorge Posada but escaped the inning without allowing a run.\nMarte recorded one out, a strikeout of Howard, in the top of the eighth inning. With it Howard set a new World Series record for most strikeouts by a hitter in a single series with a total of 13. After the out, Marte was relieved by Yankees closer Mariano Rivera in a non-save situation. Rivera allowed a double to Ibáñez, but no runs, in the eighth. After retiring the first two batters in the eighth, Eyre gave way to Ryan Madson, who allowed a single to Jeter before ending the bottom of the eighth inning. Matt Stairs led off the ninth as a pinch hitter, but lined out. Ruiz worked a walk from Rivera, but successive outs by Rollins and Victorino ended the game 7–3 to clinch the World Series for the Yankees. Pettitte added to his own record for most playoff wins, bringing his career total to 18.\nComposite line score.\n2009 World Series (4–2): New York Yankees (AL) beat Philadelphia Phillies (NL).\nBroadcasting.\nFor the tenth consecutive year in the United States, Fox Sports televised the Series. Joe Buck called play-by-play and Tim McCarver provided analysis. The Series was also broadcast on ESPN Radio, with Jon Miller and Joe Morgan calling the action. Fox Sports en Español also broadcast the Series for the US Spanish-speaking audience. The flagship radio stations of the respective teams broadcast all Series games with their local announcers. In Philadelphia, WPHT carried the Phillies' English-language broadcasts, with Scott Franzke, Larry Andersen, Tom McCarthy, Gary Matthews, and Chris Wheeler announcing, while WUBA aired the team's Spanish broadcasts. In New York, WCBS-AM carried the Yankees' English broadcasts with John Sterling and Suzyn Waldman announcing. This broadcast made Waldman the first woman to announce a World Series game on radio. XM Satellite Radio offered multiple feeds of each game to its subscribers.\nRatings.\nTelevision ratings for the 2009 World Series were excellent. Game 1 attracted 19.5 million viewers, second only to the opening of the 2004 World Series for a series opener since 2000 and 29% higher than 2008's opening game. Game 4 produced the highest total viewership of the series with 22.8 million viewers, the highest for any World Series game since 2004 and the highest for a \"non-decisive Game 4\" since 2001. At 11.7 overall, the 2009 World Series was at the time the highest rated World Series since 2004 and one of the only World Series to average double digits since 2007, the other being the 2016 World Series.\nImpact and aftermath.\nMany players with both teams won awards for their performances during the 2009 season. Teixeira and Jeter each won a Gold Glove and Silver Slugger Award; Jimmy Rollins and Shane Victorino won Gold Gloves, as well; and Chase Utley won a Silver Slugger Award. Rivera was named the 2009 DHL Delivery Man of the Year, as well as \"Sporting News\" Pro Athlete of the Year. Along with the Hank Aaron Award announced before Game 4, Jeter won the Roberto Clemente Award and was named \"Sports Illustrated\"s Sportsman of the Year for 2009. Matsui won the World Series MVP for his play, becoming the first Japanese player and first full-time designated hitter to win the award. He joined former Minnesota Twins player Dan Gladden as members of the 1994 Japan Series-winning Yomiuri Giants team who have won championships in North America and Japan. Several items related to the series were sent to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum including bats from Jeter and Matsui; caps from Rivera, Lee, and Pettitte; and Johnny Damon's cleats.\nYankees.\nThe series win brought the Yankees' franchise championship total to 27, more than any other North American professional sports franchise. This championship came in the Yankees' first year in their new stadium. They had also won the 1923 World Series, the opening year of the previous Yankee Stadium. The victory was noted by some sportswriters as a personal success for Alex Rodriguez, winning his first and only world championship and succeeding in the playoffs where some had previously claimed he was a \"choker and a loser\". Prior to this series, Rodriguez had appeared in 2,166 regular season games without a World Series appearance, then the second-most among active players to Ken Griffey Jr.\nThe Yankees' victory was credited to a number of different sources. Many players drew praise for their performances, including Series MVP Hideki Matsui; free agents signed the previous offseason including Mark Teixeira, CC Sabathia, and A. J. Burnett; and the so-called \"Core Four\" of Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, Andy Pettitte, and Jorge Posada, who had all played a large role in the Yankees' past success in the 1990s. Manager Joe Girardi was also credited for his management of the team, particularly in his decision to use only three starting pitchers in the Yankees postseason starting rotation. The Yankees were the first team to use only three starters in a World Series since the San Diego Padres in the 1998 Series.\nSeveral members of the Yankees franchise dedicated the World Series in part to team owner George Steinbrenner, who had recently stepped back from his once prominent position with the team. Steinbrenner died on the day of the All-Star Game the following season at the age of 80. On November 6, a victory parade took place for the Yankees in the \"Canyon of Heroes\" in Manhattan, New York City. The Yankees sent a group of players, coach Tony Peña, and team Senior Vice President Felix Lopez with the Commissioner's Trophy to the Dominican Republic in early January 2010 to meet with President Leonel Fernández. Most of the 2009 Yankees received their championship rings on Opening Day the next season. Matsui was on the Angels in 2010 and when the Angels played their first series of the season in the Bronx, the Yankees home opener, they presented him with his ring. They also visited U.S. President Barack Obama in the White House in April 2010, presenting him with a signed jersey.\nThe Yankees returned to the playoffs the following season, as the wild card. They lost to the Texas Rangers in the 2010 ALCS; which included an 8–0 shutout in Yankee Stadium by former Phillie ace Cliff Lee; it was Lee's seventh straight postseason win, which included three victories against the Yankees (two as a Phillie in the 2009 World Series, and in 2010 during the ALCS). The Yankees tried to acquire Lee from the Seattle Mariners during the 2010 season, but a potential trade fell through. The Yankees returned to the American League Championship Series in 2012, 2017, 2019, and 2022, losing each time and becoming the first team to lose five straight LCS. They have not been in the World Series since 2009. With the Mets losing in , this remains the most recent World Series championship by a team from New York City.\nPhillies.\nFollowing Game 4, after the Yankees took a 3–1 series lead, \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" accidentally printed a three-quarters-page Macy's advertisement congratulating the Phillies for winning the World Series, along with a picture of a Phillies championship T-shirt. The newspaper subsequently apologized for the mistake.\nLee Jenkins of \"Sports Illustrated\" attributed Philadelphia's loss to a lack of pitching depth, noting that three different Yankees starters managed to win games in the series, while only Cliff Lee won games for the Phillies. The Phillies' 2008 postseason star pitchers, starter Cole Hamels and closer Brad Lidge, struggled in their only appearances of the 2009 World Series. The Phillies bullpen which did well in the NLCS performed poorly in the World Series, allowing seven runs in just innings with a 5.40 ERA. Jorge Arangure Jr. of ESPN partially attributed the Phillies' loss to their lack of offensive production, citing the team's .227 batting average in the World Series. Only Chase Utley performed well with 5 home runs and 22 of the Phillies' 90 bases, while Shane Victorino and Jimmy Rollins struggled at the plate, and Ryan Howard struck out a record 13 times in the World Series after his NLCS MVP performance.\nDavid Paterson ticket scandal.\nAmong those in attendance during Game 1 was New York Governor David Paterson, whose party had five tickets behind home plate. On March 3, 2010, the New York Commission on Public Integrity found that Paterson had violated state laws concerning gifts to public officials, and that he lied under oath to the commission about his intent to pay for the tickets. The commission further found that Paterson used his position to solicit and receive the five tickets—valued at US$425 each—free of charge from the Yankees, that he had never intended to pay for the tickets despite testimony to the contrary, and that he or a person acting on his behalf wrote a backdated check to pay for them only after scrutiny in the case arose. The Commission ultimately fined Paterson $62,125 for his actions."

        "text": "James Richard Todd, Jr. (born September 21, 1947) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1974 to 1979 for the Chicago Cubs, Oakland Athletics, and Seattle Mariners.\nProfessional career.\nTodd was originally drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 10th round of the 1969 Major League Baseball draft. He pitched in their organization through his major league debut in 1974, when he went 4–2 with 3 saves. Shortly before the 1975 season, Todd was traded to the Oakland Athletics.\nIn 1975, Todd posted career bests in wins (8), saves (12), and ERA (2.29), and even received votes on the MVP ballot for the AL West division champion A's. He pitched briefly in each of the three games of the ALCS, which Oakland lost to the Boston Red Sox.\nThe following season, Todd's performance slipped, setting a career high in losses with 8 and seeing his ERA rise by over a run and a half to 3.81. For the first time in his career, Todd also walked more than he struck out. His decline mirrored that of the team, which missed the playoffs for the first time since 1970. The following spring, Todd was shipped back to the Cubs for veteran pitcher Joe Coleman.\nIn 1977, Todd fell apart, posting an ERA over 9 in 22 games giving up 66 baserunners in 30 innings. After July, Todd did not pitch in the majors and in October he was sent to the Seattle Mariners. Todd bounced back somewhat in 1978, but he still was giving up a lot of baserunners in 106 innings.\nAfter being released by the Mariners in February 1979, he got one last shot with the team in which he'd had his greatest success, the A's. Oakland was in the midst of losing 108 games in 1979 and Todd contributed a 6.56 ERA, walking nearly twice as many batters as he struck out. He was released the following spring and never returned to the major leagues. He did pitch one season for the Phoenix Giants in 1980 before retiring.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

        "title": "1971 Major League Baseball All-Star Game",
        "text": "The 1971 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, the 42nd edition, was played on Tuesday, July 13. The all-stars from the American League and the National League faced each other at Tiger Stadium, home of the Detroit Tigers, and the home team AL won 6–4.\nThis was the third time that the Tigers had hosted the All-Star Game (1941, 1951); the same venue was previously known as \"Briggs Stadium\". It was the second All-Star Game played at night, the first in prime-time in an American League park, and the last in Tiger Stadium. When it returned 34 years later in 2005, it was at Comerica Park, the Tigers' home since 2000.\nIt was the American League's first win since the second game of 1962, and was their last until 1983. Over the twenty game stretch from 1963–1982, the AL was , the worst run for either league in the history of the exhibition.\nNational League roster.\nThe National League roster included fifteen future Hall of Fame players and coaches, denoted in \"italics\".\nAmerican League roster.\nThe American League squad featured eleven future Hall of Fame players and coaches, denoted in \"italics\".\nStarting lineups.\nWhile the starters were elected by the fans, the batting orders and starting pitchers were selected by the managers.\nUmpires.\nJake O'Donnell retired from umpiring after the 1971 season, after only three years on the job, but would go on to work through 1995 as a referee in the NBA, earning assignment to every NBA Finals between 1972 and 1994. His work in this game makes him the only person to officiate in a Major League Baseball All-Star Game and an NBA All-Star Game.\nCoincidentally, Denkinger wore uniform number 11 from 1980 to 1998, the same number O'Donnell wore as an NBA official. The American League did not use uniform numbers for its umpires prior to 1980; the National League began using them in the 1960s. \nScoring summary.\nWith a gusty wind blowing to right, all ten runs were scored on home runs, three for each side.\nThe NL opened the scoring off starter Vida Blue in the top of the second inning. Willie Stargell was hit by a pitch to lead off. With one out, 23-year-old catcher Johnny Bench hit a two-run home run into the upper deck in deep right center. In the top of the third inning, Hank Aaron launched a two-out solo home run (his first career All-Star Game extra-base hit ) into the upper deck in right off of Blue to give the NL a 3–0 lead.\nThe AL responded in the bottom of the third inning. With Dock Ellis still pitching, Luis Aparicio singled to center to lead off the inning, and Reggie Jackson pinch-hit for pitcher Blue. On a 1–2 count, Jackson crushed a two-run home run high off the light tower atop the right center field roof. Rod Carew walked, Bobby Murcer hit an infield pop fly, which drifted and was caught near first base by third baseman Joe Torre. Carl Yastrzemski flied out to left field, held up in the wind and caught by shortstop Bud Harrelson. With two outs, Frank Robinson hit a two-run home run to right to give the AL a 4–3 lead, then Norm Cash was caught looking.\nIn the bottom of the sixth, Cubs' pitcher Ferguson Jenkins gave up a first pitch single to center by Al Kaline of the hometown Tigers. The next batter, Harmon Killebrew, launched the third two-run home run of the game for the American League. This one was pulled to the upper deck in left, against the wind, on a full count. Brooks Robinson singled, but did not advance, as a fly out to center and a 4-6-3 double play ended the inning.\nIn the top of the eighth, lefthander Mickey Lolich of the Tigers caught Bobby Bonds looking, but next up was Roberto Clemente (1934–1972); in his final All-Star Game at-bat, he launched a 3–1 pitch to the upper deck in deep right center, followed by weak ground outs by Lee May and Ron Santo. \nIn the ninth, Lolich retired the side in order (Lou Brock, Don Kessinger, Bench) for a six-out save.\nGame notes and records.\nVida Blue was credited with the win. Dock Ellis was credited with the loss. Hometown favorite Mickey Lolich was credited with the save, the first official save in an MLB All-Star Game.\nAll of the scoring came via the home run, all six home runs hit in the game and all the runs scored were by future Hall of Fame players. The six total home runs hit by both teams tied an All-Star Game record. Besides the home runs, the National League got singles by Bench and Tommy Davis; the American League got singles by Murcer, Kaline, Aparicio, and Brooks Robinson. All of them, except Davis and Murcer, were eventually inducted in Cooperstown\nFrank Robinson became the first player in All-Star Game history to hit home runs for both leagues over the course of his career.\nReggie Jackson's home run is described as \"especially memorable\", as it hit one of the light standards on the roof of the stadium, credibly estimated to have landed 520 feet from home plate.\nRoberto Clemente would be named to the 1972 National League squad, but would be replaced due to injury. This game marked his final All-Star Game appearance.\nYankee catcher Thurman Munson came in to catch in the top of the eighth inning, but did not bat.\nA total of 26 future Hall of Famers were present for this game: 21 players, both managers, National League coach Walt Alston, Hall of Fame umpire Doug Harvey, and future Hall of Fame manager Joe Torre.\nThis was the final All-Star Game in which a majority of players wore uniforms made of wool flannel. In the 1972 All-Star Game at Atlanta, only the Expos, Royals and Yankees were still wearing flannels full-time. Players from the Orioles, Pirates and Cardinals wore polyester uniforms in this All-Star Game."

A Queensland state representative, Smith became a premiership winning captain-coach with Sydney's St. George club. In seasons 1939 &amp; 1941 he was the NSWRFL premiership's top point scorer.\nCareer.\nAfter moving from Bathurst to Queensland in 1935, Smith played club football in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership for three seasons with Fortitude Valley and represented for the Maroons on two occasions in 1938. In 1939 he returned south to play in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership with the St. George club and was the league's top point-scorer that season.\nSmith was first selected to representative honours in the New South Wales rugby league team in 1940 as captain and made six appearances in 1940 &amp; 41. National representative sides did not play during WWII and Smith never represented his country.\nAt St George in 1939 aged just 23, Neville Smith was appointed the youngest captain-coach in the club's history and in 1941 he led the club to its inaugural premiership. In the Grand Final he was knocked unconscious in a heavy tackle but recovered to score 13 points (1 try and 5 goals). That season, he was again the league's highest point scorer.

        "title": "Operation Mole Cricket 19",
        "text": "Operation Mole Cricket 19 (, \"Mivtza ʻArtzav Tsha-Esreh\") was a suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) campaign launched by the Israeli Air Force (IAF) against Syrian targets on June 9, 1982, at the outset of the 1982 Lebanon War. The operation was the first time in history that a Western-equipped air force successfully destroyed a Soviet-built surface-to-air missile (SAM) network. It also became one of the biggest air battles since World War II, and the biggest since the Korean War. The result was a decisive Israeli victory, leading to the colloquial name the \"Bekaa Valley Turkey Shoot\".\nThe IAF began working on a SAM suppression operation at the end of the Yom Kippur War. Rising tensions between Israel and Syria over Lebanon escalated in the early 1980s and culminated in Syria deploying SAM batteries in the Beqaa Valley. On June 6, 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon, and on the third day of the war, with clashes ongoing between the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Syrian Army, Israel decided to launch the operation.\nThe battle lasted about two hours, and involved innovative tactics and technology. By the end of the day, the IAF had destroyed 29 of 30 SAM batteries deployed in the Beqaa Valley, and shot down 82–86 enemy aircraft, with minimal losses of its own. The battle led the United States to impose a ceasefire on Israel and Syria.\nBackground.\nAftermath of the Yom Kippur War.\nIn the Yom Kippur War of 1973, Egypt had 20 mobile SA-6 SAM systems, backed up by 70 SA-2s, 65 SA-3s, and upward of 2,500 anti-aircraft batteries and about 3,000 SA-7s. Syria deployed another 34 SAM batteries. Operation Model 5, a hastily-executed IAF attempt to take out the SAM batteries near the Golan Heights early in the fighting was unsuccessful, with catastrophic results for the attacking force. In total, during the first three days of the war, the IAF lost 50 aircraft in about 1,220 sorties, a loss rate of four percent.\nThe SA-6s, SA-7s, and ZSU-23-4 guns hit 53 of Israel's prewar total of 170 A-4 Skyhawks and 33 of its 177 F-4 Phantoms. As a result, the IAF found it difficult to provide air support to the ground troops. When Egypt tried to push beyond the range of its SAM batteries on October 14, it lost 28 aircraft while Israel won a significant land battle. Between 1973 and 1978, the IAF undertook a major project to try to find an answer to the SAM threat.\nThe losses suffered by Israel in the 1973 war were so high that it indirectly spawned the United States stealth aircraft program, Project HAVE BLUE. The U.S. estimated that without a solution to the SAM problem, even the United States would suffer depletion of its Air Force within two weeks of a conflict erupting between the U.S. and Soviet Union. The Israelis had lost 109 aircraft in 18 days.\nOn May 28, 1980, IAF guided missiles destroyed two armored cars carrying SA-9 batteries, manned by Libyan troops, near Sidon. The Israeli media declared that a solution to the SAM problem was found, but the IAF Commander, David Ivry, said that this assessment was premature, and that the SA-9 was not really significantly superior to its predecessors. The Prime Minister, Menachem Begin, then also Minister of Defense, announced that the IAF could destroy the SAM batteries in two hours. Ivry told the media that the IAF could do nothing of the kind.\n1981 SAM crisis.\nOn April 28, 1981 the IAF (F-16A fighters from 117 squadron in Ramat David air base) shot down two Syrian helicopters over Lebanon. Syria responded by deploying its first SAM brigades to the Beqaa Valley. The SAM batteries were not a direct strategic threat to Israel, and there were already several Syrian SAM batteries in east Lebanon, across the border. Begin faced a dilemma: on one hand, the new deployment damaged Israel's deterrence credibility and, on the other hand, a strike might lead to an unnecessary clash with Syria. Eventually, he decided on an attack, to be launched on April 30, but the operation was called off due to weather conditions. \nBy the time the weather cleared, the IAF was preoccupied with preparations for Operation Opera. Meanwhile, the United States was concerned that Soviet reaction to an Israeli strike might lead to a crisis between the superpowers, and pressured Begin not to attack. Israel agreed to cancel the strike, and an American envoy, Philip Habib, was sent to the region as a mediator. He shuttled between Jerusalem and Damascus but failed to get the SAM batteries removed.\nOn December 14, Israel passed the Golan Heights Law which annexed the Golan Heights to Israel. The Syrian President, Hafez al-Assad, considered it a declaration of war, but believed that Syria was in no condition to fight it. The law subjected Israel to severe American and international criticism. On December 20, the Cabinet of Israel convened for a weekly meeting, in which Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and the Chief of Staff (Ramatkal) Rafael Eitan presented the \"Big Plan\" for an invasion of Lebanon, which included seizure of the Beirut-Damascus Highway. Begin supported the plan, but other members of the Cabinet opposed and he decided to cancel it.\nThe SAM suppression operation was originally called \"Mole 3\", but the figure increased in respect to the number of SAM batteries detected, eventually reaching 19. At this point the name was changed to \"Mole Cricket\", after the name of the plan for a general war since 1973, in order to prepare the force psychologically. The name was first revealed in 2002.\nPrelude.\nOn Tuesday June 8, 1982, while Israeli forces were advancing on Jezzine, Begin addressed part of his statement in the Knesset to the Syrians, urging them not to intervene in the war and saying, \"inter alia\", that: \"I once again state that we do not want a war with Syria. From this platform I call on President Assad to instruct the Syrian army not to harm Israeli soldiers and then nothing bad will happen to [Syrian soldiers]. We desire no clashes with the Syrian army, if we reach the line 40 km from our northern border the work will have been done, all fighting will end. I am directing my words to the ears of the President of Syria. He knows how to keep an agreement. He signed a cease-fire with us and kept it. He did not allow the terrorists to act. If he behaves in this manner now in Lebanon, no Syrian soldier will be harmed by our soldiers\".\nThat night, while the Battle of Jezzine was raging in central Lebanon, Sharon said at a meeting in the Northern Command headquarters \"We know today that there will be a direct confrontation with the Syrians\" and argued that it would be best to move deeper into Lebanon. At 11:00 PM the IDF entered Ein Zahalta and were caught in a battle against a Syrian division, which halted its advance. Sharon used this as his principal argument for launching Mole Cricket 19. \nYekutiel Adam, former Deputy Chief of Staff and designated Head of the Mossad, voiced his concern that the Cabinet was not fully aware of the war's scope and objective. Nevertheless, Sharon gave North Command chief, Amir Drori, a go-ahead to drive on the Beqaa valley, and Deputy Chief of Staff Moshe Levi flew to Ein Zahalta to tell the commander, Menachem Einan, that the IAF would attack the Syrian missiles that day. \nMeanwhile, Ivry learned that unmanned aerial vehicles had spotted an additional five SA-6s moving from the Golan Heights into the Beqaa Valley. The IAF interpreted that move as a signal that Syria had no intention of becoming involved in a major war—otherwise the SAMs would have been positioned to defend the approach to Damascus. The redeployment suggested to Ivry that they could strike the SAM sites without risking an all-out war with Syria.\nSharon flew back to Jerusalem to attend a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, June 9. He said Syria had already begun moving its second armored division (the 3rd Armoured Division) south from Ein Zahalta. The political timetable dictated that waiting until Thursday would not leave enough time for a ground advance. Drori, who came with Sharon to the meeting, was against the attack, saying it was superfluous. Eitan was ambivalent, preferring to limit the attack to a signal to the Syrians. The Communications Minister, Mordechai Tzipori, argued that Sharon's plan had exceeded the original forty-kilometer line. Sharon replied that the line had to be measured from Israel's northernmost point, Metula. He added that destroying the missile batteries in the Beqaa was necessary to save the force at Ein Zahalta. \nThe Interior Minister, Yosef Burg, pointed out that a fight against the Syrians seemed imminent, in contrast to what the Cabinet wanted, and that attacking the missiles would only aggravate things and lead to an all-out war. Sharon stressed the vulnerability of the soldiers in the field. Begin turned to Ivry's deputy, Amos Amir, and asked for his projection of the IAF's losses in such an attack. Amir replied \"I cannot promise no losses whatsoever, but they will be minimal\". Begin supported the attack and eventually Burg was also convinced. Sharon left the conference and issued an order for an air strike as well as a ground operation.\nBattle.\nOn the morning of June 9, the IAF aircraft over Lebanon were operating at three levels. Kfirs and Skyhawks were along the coastline from Sidon to the outskirts of Beirut, providing close air support for the ground troops and striking at Palestine Liberation Organization targets. At the second level, over 10,000 feet (3,000 m), similar formations were circling and awaiting orders. At the top level, Hawkeyes were stationed to ensure air control. The first task force aircraft attacked the Syrian radar at the top of Jebel Baruk, which was commanding a large area.\nIvry received the green light at 10:00 AM to execute the operation, but by then he had postponed the attack until 2:00 PM. At 1:30 PM, Eitan ordered Ivry to strike, and the Israeli aircraft took off in pairs. The first wave was made up of 96 F-15s and F-16s. The second wave which attacked the SAM batteries at 3:50 PM was made up of 92 aircraft. When the attack was launched, the Syrians ordered their combat air patrols to return to base and land.\nIAF aircraft carried electronic countermeasures pods to disrupt radar tracking. The IAF command post in Tel Aviv provided Ivry a real-time command picture of the air battle through various data links. E-2Cs with airborne surveillance radar down-linked their pictures to the command post. A squadron of Tadiran Mastiff and IAI Scout Remotely Piloted Vehicles (RPV) kept at least two vehicles in the air all the time, providing constant location of the SAM batteries. A two-way voice communications link between Ivry and his pilots was set up, allowing for real-time command.\nThe primary Syrian fighters involved were MiG-21, with considerable numbers of MiG-23s and Su-20s also deployed. Syrian aircraft depended on ground-controlled interception (GCI) sites for command and control. The SAM sites were a combination of SA-2s, SA-3s, and SA-6s. The IAF's F-15s, F-16s, F-4s, and Kfirs were equipped with AIM-7F Sparrow radar-guided missiles, AIM-9L Sidewinder infrared-guided missiles, and computer-aimed 20-mm cannons. The F-15s and F-16s were equipped with a head-up display (HUD) system.\nThe Mastiff RPVs went in first to cause the Syrian SAMs to turn on their radars by convincing the Syrians that many attack aircraft were overhead. Once the Mastiffs were tracked by Syrian radar, the tracking signals were relayed to another Scout outside of the missiles' range. The Scout then relayed the signal to E2C Hawkeye aircraft orbiting off the coast. The data gathered was analyzed by the E2Cs and Boeing 707 ECM aircraft. Once the SAM crews fired missiles at the drones, the F-15s and F-16s provided air cover while F-4 Phantoms attacked the SAM batteries, destroying them with AGM-78 and AGM-45 anti-radiation missiles. The rapid flight time of the missiles minimized the F-4s' exposure to the SAMs. The Syrians reportedly fired 57 SA-6s, to no effect.\nAccording to Ivry, many of the SAM batteries were on the Syrian side of the border. Said Eitan, \"From the operational point of view I can say that we used the mini-RPVs, long before the war, to identify and locate all the Syrian missile batteries. We then used superior electronic devices which enabled us to \"blind\" or neutralize the missile sites' ground-to-air radar. We rendered them ineffective to take reliable fixes on our aircraft aloft. But in advance of direct aerial attacks, we used long-range artillery\".\nThe Syrians responded by launching about 100 fighter aircraft to stop the attacks. Intercepting IAF pilots relied frequently on VHF radio, in hopes of preserving their tactical communications and links to the command post. Selective airborne communications jamming disrupted the airwaves for the MiG-21s and MiG-23s and cut them off from ground control, making them vulnerable to AWACS-directed attacks from the Israeli F-15s and F-16s.\nThe IAF positioned RPVs over three major airfields in Syria to report when and how many Syrian aircraft were taking off. The data was transmitted to the E-2Cs. The IAF took advantage of the fact that the MiGs had only nose and tail alert radar systems and no side warnings or look-up and look-down systems, by jamming the GCI communications net. E-2Cs guided the Israeli aircraft into positions that enabled them to attack the Syrian aircraft from the side, where the latter would have no warning.\nBecause of the jamming, Syrian GCI controllers could not direct their pilots toward the incoming Israeli aircraft. The Sparrow missiles attacked at speeds of Mach 3.5 at ranges of 22 to 40 km (14 to 25 miles), which meant that they were not only outside the Syrians' radar range but also outside their visual range. The Sidewinders' \"head-on\" capabilities at close range gave the Israelis firepower advantage.\nDiscussing the Syrian response to the attacks, Eitan said: \"The first reaction of the Syrians when we attacked their missiles was to scramble their air forces... any [Syrian fighter pilots] who crossed an imaginary line in the direction of our forces was destroyed, shot down. The imaginary line was actually the range of the missile batteries in Syria proper. The basic tactic of the Syrian air force is to take to the air and to cross this imaginary line, which brings them outside the protective range of their home-based missiles. They do what they can, then run back for cover.\"\nNear 4:00 PM, with fourteen batteries destroyed and an hour left until dark, Ivry decided to call off the operation, assuming the optimal result had been achieved and that the Syrians would move more SAMs into place the next day. The operation was stopped shortly after 4:00 PM. Colonel Aviem Sella, a member of the operation staff, later said that Sharon severely criticized that decision.\nAftermath.\nThat night, the IAF destroyed the Syrian Army's 47th Armored Brigade north of Baalbek as it was moving south, and the following day, the IAF destroyed six other SAM batteries, two that remained from the operation and four that the Syrians moved into the Beqaa valley that night. Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa Tlass told Assad that \"the Syrian Air Force was outclassed, the ground-to-air missiles useless, and that without air cover, the army could not fight on\".\nSharon later said that \"If we had tolerated that development, the Syrian armored forces would have consisted of 600 tanks protected by an extensive missile umbrella. Their missile batteries fired at our planes. We had no choice other than to approve a military operation to destroy the missile buildup\". He called the operation \"the turning point\" in the invasion. A senior IAF officer, widely believed to be Ivry himself, later said that \"Syrian aircraft were fighting from a disadvantage, having to respond to the Israeli threat wherever and whenever it materialized, within a general strategic and tactical situation not in Syria's favor.\"\nTzipori later wrote in his book that Sharon had been planning the attack since the eve of the war, but tricked the Cabinet into believing that the confrontation with the Syrians was unexpected. Sharon maintained that on June 6 he had ordered the IDF not to cross the Awali River and to avoid a confrontation with the Syrians. Sharon said he did order the army to prepare for a contingency plan, however, to drive on the Beirut-Damascus highway in case the Syrians attacked first. Eitan claimed that on the night before the operation, he had agreed with Sharon to prepare the IAF for the attack, in case the Cabinet approved it. Senior Israeli commanders said after the operation that Operation Peace for Galilee could have been achieved without confronting the Syrians.\nOn Wednesday, Assad sent Tlass to Moscow to seek a comprehensive air umbrella. The Soviets refused but prepared large amounts of military equipment at airfields for dispatch to Syria and sent Marshal Pavel Kutakhov to Syria to find out what happened to the Syrian SAMs, fearing that NATO might do the same in Eastern Europe. On June 9, Assad met with American envoy Habib in Damascus and rejected his terms, demanding that Israel withdraw its forces from Lebanon as a condition for a ceasefire.\nUS President Ronald Reagan called on Begin and Assad to accept a ceasefire effective at 6:00 a.m., on June 10. By noon on Friday, when the ceasefire took effect, the IAF had shot down 82 aircraft without losing any in air combat. A year after the battle, a US fact-finding mission headed by Lieutenant General John Chain, then U.S. Air Force deputy chief of staff for plans and operations, arrived in Israel to learn lessons from the battle.\nThe Soviet military newspaper \"Krasnaya Zvezda\" announced that \"sixty-seven Israeli aircraft, including modern US-made F-15 and F-16 fighters, were downed\" in the fighting. The newspaper also reported a meeting with a Syrian airman who recounted an engagement in which he shot down an Israeli F-15: \"The victory had not been easy; the enemy had been subtle\". Even within Soviet ranks, these claims met with great skepticism. In 1991, Ivry met a Czech general who had been serving in Moscow in 1982. He told Ivry that the operation made the Soviets understand that Western technology was superior to theirs, and that in his view, the blow to the Beqaa Valley SAMs was an impetus to glasnost and the Soviet Union's collapse."

        "text": "The 1992 Major League Baseball draft took place on June 1, 1992, through a conference call involving all 28 MLB teams of the time. Phil Nevin of Cal State Fullerton was the first overall selection, chosen by the Houston Astros. Derek Jeter, selected for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in January 2020, was selected by the New York Yankees with the sixth selection. In addition to Nevin, Paul Shuey, B. J. Wallace, Jeffrey Hammonds, and Chad Mottola were selected ahead of Jeter.\nBackground.\nThe 1993 expansion Colorado Rockies and Florida Marlins participated in the MLB Draft for the first time in 1992.\nWith the first overall selections of the previous two drafts, Chipper Jones and Brien Taylor, receiving signing bonuses of $1.2 million ($ in current dollar terms) and $1.55 million ($ in current dollar terms) respectively, salary demands of new players became a factor in the 1992 draft. Prior to the draft, Jeffrey Hammonds of the Stanford Cardinal baseball team sought a signing bonus of $1.8 million ($ in current dollar terms). Derek Jeter, a high school player who had a commitment to play college baseball at the University of Michigan, was believed to be seeking a bonus of at least $1 million ($ in current dollar terms) to forego college.\nThe Astros, holding the first overall selection, were keenly aware of the bonus demands of Hammonds and Jeter, as they were unable to sign their first-round pick in the 1991 MLB draft, John Burke, who held out for a bonus of $500,000 ($ in current dollar terms) as the sixth overall selection. They selected Phil Nevin, the 1992 College World Series Most Outstanding Player, with the first overall selection. In addition to perceiving Nevin as close to MLB-ready, needing little development in minor league baseball, Nevin also did not seek a large signing bonus. He agreed to sign with the Astros for $700,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Astros' scout Hal Newhouser quit in protest, as he had insisted to Astros' management that they should choose Jeter.\nThe teams with the first four selections, the Astros, Cleveland Indians, Montreal Expos, and Baltimore Orioles, had the four lowest payrolls in MLB. The Cleveland Indians selected Paul Shuey out of the University of North Carolina with the second selection, who they projected could develop into a closer comparable to Rob Dibble. The Expos, who preferred Hammonds, drafted B. J. Wallace instead, as they were unable to afford Hammonds' salary demands. The Orioles selected Hammonds with the fourth overall selection; he signed with the Orioles for $975,000 ($ in current dollar terms), the largest signing bonus given out in the 1992 Draft. With the fifth pick, the Reds chose Chad Mottola from the University of Central Florida (UCF), making Mottola the first UCF athlete to be chosen in the first round of a professional sports draft. He signed with the Reds the day of the draft for $400,000 ($ in current dollar terms).\nYankees scout Dick Groch, assigned to scout in the Midwest, watched Jeter participate in an all-star camp held at Western Michigan University, and came away sold by Jeter's talent. Though the Yankees were also concerned that Jeter might attend college, Grouch convinced the team to select Jeter. Regarding the possibility Jeter would attend Michigan, Groch said \"the only place Derek Jeter's going is to Cooperstown\", referring to the home city of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Jeter signed with the Yankees for $800,000 ($ in current dollar terms).\nScott Boras advised Charles Johnson and Michael Tucker. Those players fell in the first round as their perceived salary demands were too high for many teams."

With the reserve clause binding players permanently to the U.S. teams in \"Organized Baseball\" who held their contracts, the insurgent Mexican League induced players such as Martin, Sal Maglie, Mickey Owen, Lou Klein, Max Lanier, Danny Gardella and others to leave their clubs — in Martin's (and Lanier's and Klein's) case, the pennant-contending but notoriously low-paying St. Louis Cardinals — for greater riches south of the border.\nMartin, then almost 31, was in his first MLB campaign after seven years of toiling in the minors and four years of World War II service in the United States Army. He had appeared in six games for the 1946, title-bound Cards, winning two of three decisions and compiling an earned run average of 4.08 in 28 innings pitched. He, along with the other \"jumpers,\" was then suspended from organized baseball by Commissioner of Baseball Albert B. Chandler. While the Mexican League raids of MLB stopped, and most of the American players soon attempted to rejoin Organized Baseball, the bans remained in force.\nIn 1949, Martin and Lanier filed a $2.5 million lawsuit against baseball in an attempt to have the five-year bans lifted. The case, \"Martin et al. v. National League Baseball Club\", was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and heard by its Chief Judge Learned Hand. As part of the lawsuit, Martin and Lanier had requested a preliminary injunction allowing the \"jumpers\" to immediately return to their former major league teams, per the reserve clause. A district judge had denied the injunction on the grounds that it would \"disturb the status quo\" by restoring the plaintiffs to positions which they had voluntarily resigned three years before. Also, the judge ruled that the players' rights depended upon disputed questions of fact and law, and that they had an adequate legal remedy in the recovery of damages. Hand and the appeals court affirmed the denial of the injunction but, with respect to the disputed questions of fact and law, added \"that the cause should be preferred, and that it should be brought to trial as soon as possible.\"\nOn June 5, 1949, Chandler lifted the ban, and so Martin and Lanier dropped the suit.\nReinstatement to U.S. pro baseball.\nMartin, nearly 34 at that point, returned to the Cardinals upon his reinstatement and posted a 6–0 mark with a 2.44 earned run average in 70 innings for the remainder of . He then spent one final season in the National League with the Cards, winning four of six decisions and posting a 5.12 earned run average. Overall, Martin appeared in 57 career MLB games, won 12 games and lost only three, with an earned run average of 3.78 in 162 innings pitched. Martin pitched in the minor leagues through the 1950s; his last pitching appearance came as the 45-year-old playing manager of the Class C St. Cloud Rox. Martin appeared in 618 minor league games between 1935 and 1960, and won 169 of 304 decisions.\nTaught 'split-finger fastball'.\nIn addition, he would have a long post-playing career as a scout, minor league manager and pitching coach, largely in the Chicago Cubs organization. He was a member of the Cubs' College of Coaches from 1961 to 1965 and served as a minor league instructor for the Cubs (1966–1975; 1977–1978) and Detroit Tigers (1976). He became especially famous as a proponent of the split-finger fastball, which he taught to Cub farmhand Bruce Sutter, who mastered it, became a dominant relief pitcher in the 1970s and 1980s, and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006.\nSutter's success focused industry-wide attention on Martin's expertise. In 1979, former Cub shortstop Don Kessinger, named the playing manager of the Chicago White Sox, asked him to be his pitching coach, but Martin was ill with cancer. He began treatments in March, and served only a few weeks in the job. He died June 11, 1979, in Chicago, at the age of 63."

        "title": "Maguire v Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (2000)",
        "text": "Maguire v SOCOG 2000 was a legal case in Australia about making a website accessible to a visually impaired person.\nComplaint.\nOn 7 June 1999, Maguire made a complaint to the human rights and equal opportunity commission (HREOC), alleging that the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) had discriminated against him as a person disabled, in contravention of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 in three aspects: the failure to provide braille copies of the information required to order Olympic Games tickets; the failure to provide braille copies of the\nOlympic Games souvenir programme; and the failure to provide a website which was accessible to Maguire. After the completion of the ticket book case (\"Maguire v SOCOG 1999\" ) on 30 September 1999, conciliation on the remaining matters was attempted but by 29 November 1999, the talks failed.\nMaguire v SOCOG 2000 (HREOC).\nMaguire v Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission), No. H 99/115, 11 August 2000 (hearing), 24 August 2000 (decision). The commissioner, on 25 February 2000, notified the two parties about resuming the inquiry on 27 March 2000. On that day 27 March, SOCOG in a direction conference agreed to provide the Souvenir programme to Maguire in braille.\nSeeking information.\nFrom 27 March 2000 to 4 August 2000, several direction conferences and letters from Maguire's solicitor to SOCOG solicitor asking SOCOG to provide information in order for Mr Worthington and Ms Treviranus who were experts in computers and adaptive technology to complete their assessment did not result in the experts receiving the complete amount of information. In providing Mr Worthington and Ms Treviranus with incomplete information, SOCOG maintained that the HTML source code was commercially sensitive to SOCOG and its contractor IBM.\nThe complete information that was sought was \"a sample page in electronic format from the proposed Results Table on the SOCOG website relating to the Olympic Games and the Paralympic website\" (the latter request was abandoned upon advice by SOCOG that it was not involved in the organisation of the Paralympic Games); the current content plan for the Olympic website; the number of templates to be used; the details of the tools used to generate the pages of the Olympic website; and detailed calculations of certain \"ball park\" figures.\"\nJurisdiction.\nAt the 3 July hearing, SOCOG presented the amended legislation effective from 13 April 2000 that transferred complaint hearing powers from HREOC to the Federal Court. The commissioner felt that the amendment did not apply because of 31 August 1999 directions. SOCOG sought Federal Court review of the commissioner's ruling, but on 3 August 2000, the Federal court dismissed the case.\nNumber of complaints.\nA witness statement submitted on 1 May 2000 confirmed that Maguire accessed SOCOG's website on 17 April 2000 and found some changes to the website but some other areas remained inaccessible. The witness statement asked for \n\"That SOCOG include ALT text on all images and image map links on the website; That SOCOG ensure access from the Schedule page to the Index of Sports; and That SOCOG ensure access to the Results Tables on the web site during the Olympic Games.\" . SOCOG used this statement to argue that the April 2000 complaint was different from the June 1999 complaint. The commissioner maintained that SOCOG's website was inaccessible and did not meet the W3C guidelines on accessibility. It was noted that SOCOG on 27 July 2000 provided Maguire information of URL addresses of each of the 37 individual sports to access the index of sports from the schedule. Even though the original complaint was general which was then particularised for the three areas, the commissioner felt the April 2000 and the June 1999 complaints were the same.\nService.\nSOCOG argued that the promotional material of the website was not included by the DDA 1992 definition of \"service\". The commissioner declared that the provision of information was included by the Section 4 definition of \"service\" which made Section 24 valid.\nTreated less favourably.\nSOCOG submitted that there was not any direct discrimination as Maguire in using the website was not treated less favourably than a sighted person. The incompletion of adding ALT texts and an imperfect mode access that should not be attempted by a sighted person were reasons that caused the commissioner to find that SOCOG in providing services in a manner accessible to sighted persons but inaccessible or partially accessible to a blind person violated section 5 and 24 of DDA 1992 Additionally, the commissioner found that SOCOG violated Section 6 by imposing a requirement that Maguire should be able to read print, with which a substantially greater proportion of persons without Maguire's disability was able to comply.\nUnjustifiable hardship.\nSOCOG said that it did not discriminate unlawfully against Maguire but if it did, that the cost and effort in retraining staff and redrawing entire development methods was an unjustifiable hardship in providing an accessible website. SOCOG argued that the Table of Results is composed of data sourced from a number of different databases of results for each of 37 sporting disciplines; the site consists currently of 6,000 pages and approximately 55,000 pages will be generated during the course of the Games; there are 37 sports webpage templates each with approximately 35 result templates – in total 1,295 templates for results alone; the tables of results will contain \"wrapped text within cells\"; there will be approximately six billion \"hits\" on the site and the site needs to be fast and very responsive; to reformat the site and its contents in a way which will make the website accessible to the complainant will in effect require the development of a new or separate website; extensive changes to infrastructure are required; there is a requirement for specialised skills which are limited and expensive; there will be possible adverse effects upon the support and maintenance systems; one person working 8-hour business days would require 368 days to complete the task properly; $2.2 million of additional infrastructure would be required to separately host the additional designs necessary to an accessible Table of Results.\nHowever, Maguire with expert witnesses argued that the number of templates is significantly less than 1,295 and the reformatting of the templates will require considerably less than the two hours for each alleged by SOCOG; a more realistic estimate for the minor changes required is ten minutes each; nor is there the need for unique manually generated formats; no new infrastructure will be required because it is allegedly extant; a team of one experienced developer with a group of 5-10 assistants could provide an accessible site to Level A compliance in four weeks; wrapping in each cell can be met by using a simple device namely the inclusion of an invisible end of cell character which would indicate to a blind person the end of the text in each cell; the cost of making the site accessible is a modest amount; the number of templates has been estimated at 357 for 28 sports. Additional templates would be required for 37. Because of the failure of respondent to supply the information requested by letter on 31 March 2000 the number of templates has been estimated.\nThe expert witnesses of Maguire who provided months of advice convinced the commissioner more than the expert witnesses of SOCOG who provided days of advice just before the August hearing. Despite conflicting arguments stated above, the Commissioner found that SOCOG who had unlawfully discriminated in violation of the DDA, delayed the final determination of that complaint of the commissioner and took advantage of matters consequential upon that delay in order to support its alleged inability to cure its problem.\nFinal decision.\nThe Commissioner found that SOCOG had engaged in unlawful discrimination against Maguire in violation of Section 24 of the DDA 1992. SOCOG was ordered to render its website accessible including ALT text on all images and image map links on its website; providing access to the Index of Sports from the Schedule page; and providing access to the Results Tables to be used on the website during the Sydney Olympic Games by 15 September 2000. Failure on SOCOG's part to comply with that order would give Maguire the option to press for compensation.\nBruce Lindsay Maguire v. Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games 2000 HREOC.\nBruce Lindsay Maguire v. Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (Respondent) (HREOC) H 99/115, date of hearing: 6 November 2000, date of ex tempore decision: 6 November 2000, date of written decision: 18 November 2000.\nThe Commissioner found that SOCOG only partially complied and as a result, by section 103(1)(b)(iv) of the DDA, the commissioner awarded Maguire $20,000.\nCase significance.\nAustralian governments have decided to adopt the W3C Guidelines, with the Commonwealth Government requiring all agency websites to pass accessibility tests by 1 December 2000.\nIt is questionable what tests are to be complied with, and what degree of compliance would be required. Since this case there been greater scrutiny of the accessibility of subsequent Olympic Games websites. Peter Coroneos from the Internet Industry Association warned businesses that the SOCOG decision confirmed that the DDA applied to online services and that Australian websites targeting overseas customers may be liable under equivalent legislation.\nSee also.\nMaguire v Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (1999)"

Phillips was previously with Dunaújvárosi Acélbikák in the Erste Liga.\nPlaying career.\nPhillips began his career within the Kingston upon Hull club in England, playing for Kingston Crunch under-16, Kingston Predators under-19 and then Kingston Jets of the English National League in November 2003. He then moved up to the Hull Stingrays in the British National League, a team which joined the Elite League in 2006. Phillips established himself as one of Britain's top defencemen and served as assistant captain of the Stingrays in the 2007–08 season. He moved to the Belfast Giants for the 2008–09 season, becoming new coach Steve Thornton's first signing. Establishing a career high 25 points in 54 games, Phillips helped the Giants to be crowned Champions of the Challenge Cup and Knockout Cup.\nOn 28 April 2009, Phillips re-signed to remain with the Giants for the following season. However, with NHL ambitions, and following an impressive performance in a Chicago Blackhawks evaluation camp, Phillips was signed to a two-way contract with American Hockey League affiliate team, the Rockford IceHogs on 12 July 2009. He participated on an invitation in the Blackhawks training camp, before returning to the IceHogs to begin the 2009–10 season. After making his North American debut against the Peoria Rivermen on 4 October 2009, Phillips was briefly loaned to ECHL team Toledo Walleye, scoring his first North American professional goal, before he was recalled to the IceHogs to remain for the majority of the season posting 6 assists in 52 games.\nOn 8 April 2010, it was confirmed that Phillips had agreed to a one-year deal with fellow AHL team, the Chicago Wolves for the 2010–11 season. Phillips was then assigned to the Walleye of the ECHL to begin the 2010 season. After appearing in one game with the Wolves in November he was returned to Toledo. With only five points in 31 games with the Walleye, on 12 November, Phillips was reassigned by the Wolves to fellow ECHL team, the Gwinnett Gladiators. On 25 December, Dave was released from his contract with the Wolves and shortly joined fellow AHL team, the Lake Erie Monsters, on a professional try out on 5 January 2011. After posting three assists in 10 games with the Monsters, Phillips returned to the Gladiators. Towards the end of his first stint with the Monsters, Phillips signed with Australian-based team, the Adelaide Adrenaline, for the forthcoming 2011 season on 12 January 2011.\nOn 10 May 2011, it was announced that Phillips would be returning to Britain and the Elite Ice Hockey League with the Coventry Blaze.\nAfter the Hull Stingrays announced they would not take part in the 2015–16 season, who Phillips was to play for, it was made public that the newly reformed Manchester Storm along with Matty Davies would sign both players for the coming season.\nIn 2016, Phillips signed with the Sheffield Steelers, remaining with the team until 2020. However, following the suspension of the 2020–21 Elite League season, Phillips signed abroad for a third time after agreeing to join Hungarian Erste Liga side Dunaújvárosi Acélbikák.\nIn February 2021, Phillips moved to Sweden to sign for Hockeyettan side Karlskrona HK. Later that month, Phillips signed for UK NIHL side Sheffield Steeldogs ahead of their Spring Cup series, before returning to the Sheffield Steelers in time for the 2021 Elite Series.\nIn May 2023, Phillips became the sixth men's Great Britain ice hockey player to win 100 senior caps, a milestone he reached at the 2023 IIHF World Championship Division I.\nPhillips then re-joined the Belfast Giants ahead of the 2023–24 Elite League season."

Cycling in Victoria has been encouraged by the development of bicycle networks in town and cities throughout the state, and many regional rail trails. The sports popularity has been encouraged by the success of racing clubs such as the St Kilda Cycling Club and Victorian racing riders such as Cadel Evans, Simon Gerrans and Matthew Lloyd. Organised rides held annually including the Great Victorian Bike Ride, and races held in Victoria include the Herald Sun Tour.\nRegional rail trails.\nVictoria also has many developed rail trails suitable for cycling including:\nSafety.\nAccording to VicRoads hazards that cause cycling fatalities and injuries include \"side impact at intersections\", \"manoeuvring\", \"lane change\" as well as collisions between car doors and cyclists in the door zone, commonly referred to as \"car dooring\" in Australia.\nIn Victoria it is illegal to \"cause a hazard to any person or vehicle by opening a door of a vehicle, leaving a door of a vehicle open, or getting off, or out of, a vehicle\" and it is also illegal to flee the scene of such an accident.\nWhile there were 1112 collisions caused by opening doors in the Australian state of Victoria between 2000 and 2010, the first fatality occurred in March 2010, when a car door opening caused university student James Cross to be propelled under the wheels of a passing truck. Eight percent of serious injuries to cyclists between 2006 and 2010 were cause by car doorings.\nIn July 2012 Victoria increased the on-the-spot penalty for car dooring from $141 to $352, also increasing the maximum court imposed penalty from $432 to $1408. In March 2015 stickers were placed in taxis in the state, advising passengers to look for bicycles before leaving the vehicle; at the time 13% of car dooring incidents in the state involved taxis."

At the Paralympics, World Championships and other elite level competitions, swimmers compete in an Olympic-size swimming pool.\nSignificant differences between able-bodied and para swimming include the starting position and adaptations allowed for visually impaired swimmers. Competitors may start a race by standing on a platform and diving into the pool, as in non-disabled swimming, or by sitting on the platform and diving in, or they may start the race in the water. In events for the blind and visually impaired, people called \"tappers\" may stand at the end of the pool and use a pole to tap the swimmers when they approach the wall, indicating when the swimmer should turn or end the race. No prostheses or assistive devices may be worn during competition.\nClassification.\nSwimmers are classified according to the type and extent of their disability. The classification system allows swimmers to compete against others with a similar level of function.\nSwimmers with physical disabilities are allocated a category between 1 and 10, with 1 corresponding to the most severe types of disability. Physical disabilities of para swimmers include single or multiple limb loss (through birth defects and/or amputation), cerebral palsy, spinal cord injuries (leading to paralysis or disability in limb coordination), dwarfism, and disabilities which impair the use of joints.\nBlind and visually impaired swimmers compete within separate categories, being allocated to categories 11, 12 or 13. Category 11 corresponds to totally blind swimmers, while competitors in category 12 have severe but not total visual impairment. Category 11 swimmers compete with blackened goggles to ensure competitors are on an even level. Category 11 swimmers are also required to use tappers but they are optional for categories 12 and 13.\nSwimmers with mental disabilities compete in category 14, while deaf and hearing impaired swimmers compete in category 15.\nNumbers are combined with a letter prefix depending on the event type. An \"S\" prefix corresponds to freestyle, backstroke and butterfly, while \"SB\" corresponds to breaststroke and \"SM\" to the medley. Hence, a swimmer with severe physical disabilities competing in backstroke may compete in an S3 event, while a blind swimmer in the medley would compete in class SM11.\nFor relay races, athletes from different classifications compete together, but the sum of their individual classifications must not exceed a given points total. For example, a relay team for a 34 points freestyle relay may consist of two S8 swimmers and two S9 swimmers (9 + 9 + 8 + 8 = 34), or an S10 swimmer and three S8 swimmers (10 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 34) \nEvents.\nSwimming at the Summer Paralympics\nWorld Para Swimming Championships\nWorld Para Swimming European Championships\nPara Swimming World Series - Since 2017.\nPara Swimming World Series.\nSource:\nhttps://www.paralympic.org/swimming/about\nThe World Series was launched in 2017.\n2017.\nSource:\n2017 World Para Swimming World Series \nCity, country Name Date\n2018.\nSource:\n2018 World Para Swimming World Series \nCity, country Name Date\n2019.\nSource:\n2019 World Para Swimming World Series \nCity, country Name Date\n2020.\nSource:\n2020 World Para Swimming World Series \nCity, country Name Date\n2021.\nSource:\n2021 World Para Swimming World Series \nCity, country Name Date\n2022.\nSource:\n2022 World Para Swimming World Series \nCity, country Name Date\n2023.\nSource:"

        "title": "Cheshire County Cricket League",
        "text": "The Cheshire County Cricket League is a cricket league based in England. It is the top level of competition for recreational club cricket in the Cheshire area and is a designated ECB Premier League.\nThe league was founded in 1975, and the twelve founder member clubs were Alderley Edge, Bowdon, Bramhall, Brooklands, Cheadle, Cheadle Hulme, Heaton Mersey, Macclesfield, Marple, Northwich, Warrington, and Winnington Park. The clubs were divided into two divisions in 1995, by which time there were 24 clubs in membership, and since 1999 they have been divided into three divisions. The league became an ECB Premier League in 1999.\nThe clubs competing in the 1st XI Premier Division for 2020 were intended to be: Alderley Edge, Cheadle, Chester Boughton Hall, Didsbury, Hyde, Nantwich, Neston, Oulton Park, Oxton, Timperley, Toft, and Widnes. The 2020 competition was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A replacement competition was organised for the later part of the season when cricket again became possible, but with the winners not to be regarded as official league champions.\nLeague structure.\nThe Cheshire County Cricket League covers the historic county of Cheshire, which includes the unitary authorities of Cheshire West and Chester, Cheshire East, Warrington Borough Council and the Borough of Halton, and the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport. It is the top tier of the pyramid structure of leagues in the area. \nThe league for 1st XI teams has a Premier and three lower divisions. There are currently 12 teams in each division. Along with the 1st XI divisions, the Cheshire County Cricket League runs concurrent leagues for 2nd and 3rd XIs. The 2nd league is a duplicate 1st XI league with 12 teams per division. The 3rd XI league has a premier division, and divisions 1 and 2, but below that the teams play within the geographical county areas of 3rd XI Division 3 West and 3rd XI Division 3 East. A 3rd XI Division 4 is also offered for XIs in the Greater Manchester region. \nClubs are promoted and relegated from the Cheshire County Cricket League based on the performances of their 1st XIs. Two clubs are promoted and relegated to and from the Premier Division every season. This format is replicated in Divisions 1, 2 and 3. The bottom two clubs in Division 3 are relegated to Division 1 of the Cheshire Cricket League, and the two top clubs from this feeder league are promoted into the Division 3 of the county league."

        "title": "Cornwall Cricket League",
        "text": "The Bond Timber Cornwall Cricket League Premier Division is the top level of competition for recreational club cricket in Cornwall, United Kingdom and is a designated an England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) Premier League. St Just CC are the most successful club, having won the competition on eight occasions.\nHistory.\nFrom 1905 until 1989 there were two top divisions in Cornwall; \"Cornwall Senior League 1 East\" and \"Cornwall Senior League 1 West\". The teams finishing in first place in the two divisions played for the Western Morning News Cup with the winner declared champions of Cornwall. The last winners of the Western Morning News Cup were St Gluvias who beat St Austell by 22 runs. In 1990 the top six clubs in the east and west leagues formed County League One with St Just winning the league despite only finishing 6th in the Western league the previous season. The irony of St Just winning the first title was that they were initially to an all-Cornwall league because of the increased expenditure of travel for teams in the far west.\nThe English Cricket Board accredited Cornwall Cricket League Premier Division was formed in 2001, with a number of changes to the format of the matches. The league was reduced from twelve to ten with each teams playing the others on three occasions. Matches now consisted of a maximum of 120 overs with the team batting first having the option of using up to 60 overs, postponed matches did not have to be replayed, and winning and losing draws were once more allowed. It was also the first time that there was a Cornwall-wide administrative body; previously the east and west leagues had separate administrators. There were a number of advantages to participating in the ECB league structure which included financial assistance of £9,500 per year and encouragement to improve facilities and coaching.\nTruro were champions in the first two seasons without losing a single match, having an unbeaten run of over fifty matches. Newquay followed their promotion the previous season by becoming champions of Cornwall for the first time in 2003. St Buryan had been the runners-up in the first three seasons but decided to withdraw from the league in November 2003, due to the belief that their team would not competitive, leading to the division being reduced to nine teams. In 2004 the clubs decided to share the 110 overs per match equally and St Just won the first of their six successive championships beating Truro, the second-placed team, on the final day of the season. St Just's run came to an end in 2010 when local rivals Paul won the championship for the first time (having been runner-up three seasons previous).\nDraws were once again abolished before the 2016 season.\nFormat.\nThe ECB Cornwall Premier League consists of ten teams each playing the others on a home and away basis, to make a total of 18 matches each.
