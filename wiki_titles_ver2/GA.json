In 2009, the players, unhappy with poor training facilities and lack of practice time from the club, contacted Ungmennafélagið Stjarnan and inquired if the board would be interested in starting a women's team. The Stjarnan board responded positively, as they had been unsuccessfully trying to start a women's team for a few years, and in the end all 14 Ármann players transferred over to form the first Stjarnan women's team. Ármann did not field a team again until the 2017–2018 season when it failed to register a win in 24 games in the 1. deild kvenna. In May 2020, the team returned to the 1. deild kvenna for the first time since 2018. On 15 March 2022, the team won the 1. deild kvenna championship, its first title in 62 years, after winning 18 of 20 games, including 15 in a row to finish the season."

        "title": "2019 Group 10 Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 2019 Group 10 Rugby League season was the 73rd season of the premier rugby league competition in the Central West area of New South Wales. It was run under the auspices of the Country Rugby League. It was the seventh consecutive season to feature nine teams, after the re-admittance of the Blayney Bears in 2013.\nBathurst Panthers entered the season as defending champions, after defeating Cowra Magpies 12–10 in the 2018 Premier League decider. Panthers five-eighth and goal kicker Willie Wright kicked a match-winning conversion with four minutes remaining in the decider played at Cowra's Sid Kallas Oval, sealing Panthers first Premier League title since 2007.\nPanthers would defend its title with a 9–8 win over Mudgee Dragons in the grand final at Carrington Park that went to extra-time.\nPremier League season summary.\nEighteen rounds was played between March and August, which concluded with a finals played under the top five McIntyre system. Bathurst Panthers played its round one match against Blayney Bears on March 30 at Carrington Park. The match acted as a curtain raiser to NRL match between the Penrith Panthers and Melbourne Storm later that evening. The remainder of the first round of Group 10 Premier League was played on weekend beginning on April 13.\nOrange Hawks claimed the minor premiership, but were bundled out in straight sets to be the first minor premier to miss the grand final since 1998, which ironically was the Orange Hawks. The grand final was played between the Bathurst Panthers and Mudgee Dragons. The match went to extra-time after the match finished 8–all after 80 minutes. Panthers captain-coach Doug Hewitt would kick a field goal in extra-time to give his side a 9–8 lead, which would prove enough for Panthers to claim a second consecutive premiership and its fourth overall.\nTeams\nGroup 10 Premier League ladder.\nUpdated to match(es) played on unknown. Source: &lt;br&gt;Rules for classification: 1) points; 2) point difference; 3) number of points scored.\nGroup 10 Premier League finals series.\n&lt;section begin=\"Group 10 bracket\" /&gt;\n&lt;section end=\"Group 10 bracket\" /&gt;\nGrand final.\nGrand final report.\nBathurst Panthers hosted the Group 10 Rugby League grand final day for the first time since 2007. Mudgee Dragons had won all their grand finals against Panthers (in 2000 and 2004) at Carrington Park.\nThe match was a low-scoring affair and it wasn't until the Dragons gave away two straight penalties that Panthers broke the deadlock with a penalty goal from the boot of Willie Wright in the 18th minute to give the Bathurst side a 2–nil lead.\nNeither team could build momentum as both sides continued to shoot themselves in the foot through handling errors or discipline issues, but the Dragons crowd came to life with two minutes remaining in the half, voicing their approval of a huge break down the middle from Ben Thompson. Nathan Orr made the most of the chance close to the line, fending off an opponent before planting down the ball for the only try of the opening half. Mudgee lead 4–2 at half-time.\nAfter play resumed for the second-half, Panthers looked to their left wing for a response eight minutes into the new half, however, Louis Murphy was denied on the try line by desperate Dragons defence.\nAnother Orr fend gave the Dragons centre a chance to score in the 57th minute but a strong tackle from Josh Rivett put him into touch.\nHowever, Jack Beasley wasn't going to be denied five minutes later and the Mudgee substitute crashed over to give the Dragons a 8–2 lead.\nIt was on the 67th minute mark that the Panthers found their opening try of the match as second rower Jack Siejka scored between the uprights.\nWright's conversion brought the score level at 8–all and with no team finding the winning points in the remaining minutes, the match went to extra-time, the first grand final to require extra-time since 2006.\nExtra-time would be five minutes each way and in their first chance to break the deadlock, captain-coach Doug Hewitt slotted home a field goal.\nThe Panthers held on to win their second consecutive Group 10 Rugby League Premier League title.\nBathurst Panthers 9 (Jack Siejka try; Willie Wright 2 goals, Doug Hewitt field goal)\nMudgee Dragons 8 (Nathan Orr, Jack Beasley tries)"

        "text": "The 2019 Challenge Cup known as the Coral Challenge Cup for sponsorship reasons, is the 118th staging of the Challenge Cup, the main rugby league knockout tournament for teams in the Super League, the British National Leagues and a number of invited amateur clubs.\nThe defending champions were Catalans Dragons, who beat Warrington Wolves 20–14 at Wembley Stadium on 25 August 2018, to become the first non-British team to win the challenge cup in its 117-year history.\nHowever, they were eliminated in the quarter-finals after a 51–8 defeat, away to Hull F.C.\nThe format of the competition will be eight knock-out rounds followed by the final. The final will be held on the August bank holiday weekend, and from 2020 the final will move to July, but will still be played at Wembley Stadium. The day of the final will see three matches played back-to-back, with the Challenge Cup final being preceded by the Steven Mullaney Memorial Match (the RFL Champion Schools Final for Year 7s), and the final of the newly announced 1895 Cup for clubs in the Championship and League 1.\nA new sponsorship deal was announced in January 2019, with Coral replacing Ladbrokes (although both are part of the Ladbrokes Coral group).\nRound details.\n\"*Toulouse Olympique and Toronto Wolfpack declined to participate in the competition.\"\nEntry.\nEntry into the Cup is mandatory for the English and Welsh professional teams, but is by invitation for all other clubs, either professional or amateur. French side Toulouse declined to enter for 2019, after also declining to play in the 2018 competition. Canadian side Toronto Wolfpack also declined to enter for 2019, after both clubs were presented with a demand by the Rugby Football League (RFL) for roughly £750,000 (€830,000; C$1,226,000 approximately) as a bond insurance against reduced ticket sales, if either team reached the final.\nIn January 2019 it was revealed that defending champions, Catalans Dragons, had also been asked to pay a £500,000 (€553,000) bond to enter the competition. Catalans informed the RFL, that the club had no intention of paying, leading to the possibility, that for the first time ever, the competition would take place without the defending champions being in the tournament. However, after settling their dispute with the RFL, it was confirmed that they would be defending their title.\nThe first and second rounds of the competition are competed for solely by amateur teams, and for 2019, 51 British based teams are joined by Serbian side Red Star in the draw for the first round of the cup. Red Star's entry is on condition that they play away from home in the first and second rounds (assuming victory in the first round). The 51 amateur clubs are 47 British teams together with four teams representing the armed forces and the British police. This season will be the first since the 1990s, that no student sides will be playing in the competition.\nFirst round.\nThe draw was made on 14 December 2018 at Headingley Rugby Stadium and was streamed live on the BBC Sport website. The home teams were drawn by Leeds Rhinos Women captain Lois Forsell and the away teams by Bradford Bulls coach John Kear. Ties are to be played over the weekend of 26/27 January 2019.\nSecond round.\nThe draw was made on 28 January 2019 at Wigan St Patricks and was streamed live on the BBC Sport website. The home teams were drawn by Leigh Centurions captain Mickey Higham and the away teams by Wigan Warriors halfback George Williams. Ties are to be played over the weekend of 9–10 February 2019.\nThird round.\nThe draw for the third round was made at St Mary's Guildhall, Coventry on 11 February and shown live on the BBC Sport website. The draw was made by Coventry born athletes Kare Adenegan and David Moorcroft. During the draw ball number six (Haydock) was announced wrongly as number nine (Lock Lane) and vice versa. The RFL later confirmed that the draw would be as the balls drawn and not as they were announced.\nFourth round.\nThe draw for the fourth round was made at Odsal Stadium, home of the Bradford Bulls on 12 March and shown live on the BBC Sport website. The draw was made by former Bradford player Robbie Hunter-Paul and Simon Foster, son of former player Trevor Foster.\nFifth round.\nThe fifth round ties were drawn on 1 April and shown live on BBC Sport. The home teams were drawn by Linzi Prescott (widow of Steve Prescott) and the away teams by Martin Offiah. Ties will be played over the weekend of 11–14 April.\nSixth round.\nThe draw for the sixth round was made on 15 April 2019. Originally planned to be shown live on the BBC News Channel, the coverage was displaced due to ongoing coverage of the Notre-Dame de Paris fire and instead was restricted to live streaming on the BBC Sport website. The home teams were drawn by Paul Sculthorpe and the away teams by Jon Wilkin. Ties will be played over the weekend of 10–12 May.\nBroadcasts of matches changed from on-line only to mainstream TV at this stage, with BBC and Sky Sports each televising two ties. BBC One will show the first competitive meeting of West Yorkshire rivals Bradford Bulls and Leeds Rhinos on Saturday 11 May. On Sunday 12 May, BBC One will show the repeat of the 2018 Super League Grand Final between Wigan Warriors and Warrington Wolves. Sky Sports will show two all-Super League ties; Hull F.C. v Castleford Tigers on Friday 10 May, and Huddersfield Giants v St. Helens on Sunday 12 May.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe draw for the quarter finals was made on 12 May live on BBC1, directly after the televised sixth-round tie between Wigan Warriors and Warrington Wolves, with Ellery Hanley and Jonathan Davies conducting the draw. The ties will be played 30 May – 2 June.\nBroadcasts.\nThe primary broadcast organisation for the competition was BBC Sport. As in 2018 the BBC streamed one tie from each of the first five rounds live on the BBC Sport website with two games from the 6th, 7th, 8th rounds and the final being broadcast live on BBC TV."

While playing college ice hockey with the University of Denver, Moore was named to the NCAA Second All-American Team and NCHC Forward of the Year. Moore helped lead the American Hockey League (AHL)'s Toronto Marlies to their first Calder Cup in 2018.\nPlaying career.\nMoore grew up in Ventura County, California, where he played youth ice hockey for the Los Angeles Hockey Club. In high school he played with the Tri-City Storm, of the United States Hockey League, in Kearney, Nebraska. He then played three seasons with the University of Denver. In his freshman year, Moore was named to the NCHC All-Rookie Team. In his sophomore year, he was named to the NCAA Second All-American Team and NCHC Forward of the Year.\nAfter his junior season, Moore signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs as an undrafted free agent on July 26, 2016. He subsequently joined the Maple Leafs' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Toronto Marlies, for the 2016–17 season after attending the Leafs training camp. In Moore's second season with the Marlies, 2017–18, he helped them earn their first Calder Cup.\nOn November 13, 2018, Moore was recalled to the Maple Leafs ahead of their West Coast road trip. He was sent back to the Marlies shortly after, but following an injury to Tyler Ennis, he was recalled again on December 23. Moore made his NHL debut that night in a 5–4 overtime win against the Detroit Red Wings, recording up his first career NHL point, an assist on a goal by Frédérik Gauthier. His first goal was scored four games later, on January 5, 2019, in a 5–0 win over the Vancouver Canucks.

She took up refereeing aged 17 after seeing an advert for referees in a match programme. After a friend bet her £5 that she wouldn't apply she did so but faced considerable resistance in being accepted due to her being a woman. Lee started by officiating at junior games but after moving to London she started officiating open-age games. After returning from a period in Australia, where she became the first woman to referee a game, she moved up the refereeing ranks and by 1990 was officiating games in the National Conference League Premier Division - the highest league in the amateur game - as well as games involving the reserve sides of professional clubs. Lee refereed her first professional game at Keighley Cougars during the 1993–94 season.\nInjury forced her to retire in 2000 after she had refereed over 500 matches including the Oxford v Cambridge Varsity match and internationals in Australia and New Zealand.\nPost-retirement Lee worked for the Rugby Football League as a director of community projects and events. Lee established her own life-coaching company, Common Sense Initiative, in 2017.\nIn 2018 \"Ref!\" a play written by Sarah Jane Dickenson and inspired by Lee's career premiered at Hull Kingston Rovers KCOM Stadium."

Approximately 70 gymnasts from 35 nations (of the 98 total gymnasts) competed in the all-around in the qualifying round.\nDaiki Hashimoto of Japan became the youngest men's artistic gymnastics individual all-around champion in history at the age of 19, earning his first individual Olympic (gold) medal and second Olympic medal overall. He is also Japan's second youngest gymnast to win Olympic gold, losing the youngest title to Kenzo Shirai by only 6 days. This is the third gold in a row for Japan in the men's artistic individual all-around, after two consecutive gold medals won by Kōhei Uchimura at the last two Olympics in 2012 and 2016. This victory was Japan's seventh overall, breaking the tie Japan shared with the Soviet Union, which now have one fewer at six, for the most victories in the men's individual all-around event. Hashimoto's medal also earned the Japanese gymnastics program its 100th overall Olympic medal. Chinese gymnast Xiao Ruoteng won the silver, also his first individual Olympic medal. Nikita Nagornyy of the ROC, a two-time Olympic team medalist, took the bronze. The score difference between silver and bronze was only 0.034.

Two-time defending champion Kōhei Uchimura of Japan did not qualify to attempt winning a third consecutive title, after which he choose to focus on the individual horizontal bar during qualifications.

Each gymnast can only earn one place, except that gymnasts that competed with a team that qualified are eligible to earn a second place through the 2020 All Around World Cup Series. Some of the individual events are open to gymnasts from NOCs with qualified teams, while others are not.

According to the FIG's tie-breaking procedure, Shin prevailed due to having the higher single individual vault score (14.833 vs 14.800). It was Ablyazin’s third Olympic silver medal in a row in individual vault finals, and this was also the second time at these Olympics that the tie-breaking procedure had worked in Shin's favour as the same situation happened in vault qualifications. Fourth- and fifth-place finishers, Carlos Yulo and Nikita Nagornyy respectively, also tied on total score (14.716 points), but Yulo earned the higher placement due to his single higher individual vault score (14.866 vs 14.833)."

        "text": "The women's floor event at the 2020 Summer Olympics was held on 25 July and 2 August 2021 at the Ariake Gymnastics Centre. Approximately 85 gymnasts from 53 nations (of the 98 total gymnasts) competed on floor in the qualifying round.\nJade Carey won the competition, earning the United States' third consecutive title on floor. The title is Carey's first Olympic medal. Italy's Vanessa Ferrari earned silver to win her first Olympic medal, as well Italy's first individual Olympic medal in women's artistic gymnastics and second-ever medal overall. Mai Murakami of Japan and Angelina Melnikova of ROC tied for the bronze. It is Murakami's first Olympic medal and Melnikova's fourth. Like Ferrari, Murakami's medal is also the first individual Olympic medal for her country in women's artistic gymnastics and second-ever overall.\nThe medals for the competition were presented by Octavian Morariu, Romania; IOC Member, and the medalists' bouquets were presented by Farid Gayibov, Azerbaijan; FIG Executive Committee Member.\nBackground.\nThis was the 19th appearance of the event, after making its debut at the 1952 Summer Olympics. Defending champion Simone Biles of the United States was aiming to become the first woman to defend their title since Nellie Kim in 1976 and 1980. Representing Italy, Vanessa Ferrari has returned for her fourth Olympic Games, hoping to leave with a medal after coming shy of bronze in 2012 and 2016. Biles qualified in second place behind Ferrari after a relatively subpar performance by her standards. However, she announced her withdrawal on 31 July 2021 due to continued mental blocks, following earlier withdrawals from the team and individual all-around finals, as well as the first day of individual event finals.\nQualification.\nA National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to 6 qualified gymnasts: a team of 4 and up to 2 specialists. A total of 98 quota places are allocated to women's gymnastics.\nThe 12 teams that qualify will be able to send 4 gymnasts in the team competition, for a total of 48 of the 98 quota places.

The US Women's Gymnastics Olympic Team consisted of returner Simone Biles, Jordan Chiles, Sunisa Lee and Grace McCullum; with individuals MyKayla Skinner and Jade Carey.\nThe remaining 50 quota places are awarded individually. Each gymnast can only earn one place, except that gymnasts that competed with a team that qualified are eligible to earn a second place through the 2020 All Around World Cup Series.

The qualifying round (for all women's gymnastics events) was the first day with the floor final on the third and final day of individual event finals.\nResults.\nQualifying.\nThe reserves for the women's floor final were:\nOnly two gymnasts from each country may advance to the event final. No gymnasts were excluded from the final because of the quota, although ROC gymnasts Vladislava Urazova and Lilia Akhaimova, and American gymnasts Jordan Chiles and MyKayla Skinner were excluded as reserves due to the two-per-country rule.\nFinal.\nBronze medalists Mai Murakami and Angelina Melnikova had identical E-scores (8.266), and also identical D-scores (5.9), meaning that the tie was unbroken per FIG's standard tie-breaking procedures. Practically, this also means that both gymnasts would be awarded the same rank, which is very rare today, and this is the first time since 1996 to have a tie on the podium in men's and women's artistic gymnastics when current Olympic-tie-breaking rules took effect at the 2000 Sydney Games.\nJade Carey earned the US's third consecutive gold medal in the floor event for the past three Olympics. Vanessa Ferrari at the age of 30 finally got her Olympic medal on floor, after placing 4th at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics. She scored third highest in the floor final at the 2012 London Olympics, but the tie-breaking procedure worked against her to rank her fourth and out of the medals in the standings."

        "text": "The Women's rhythmic individual all-around competition at the 2020 Summer Olympics was held at the Ariake Gymnastics Centre in Tokyo, Japan, with the qualification taking place on 6 August and the final on 7 August.\nLinoy Ashram became the first Israeli athlete to win a medal in the individual all-around competition and the first Israeli woman to win an Olympic gold medal. It was the first time a non-Russian athlete won the gold medal since 1996, and the first time an athlete from outside the former Soviet Union won in an Olympics where the traditionally-dominant former Eastern Bloc states participated.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition consisted of a qualification round and a final round. The top ten gymnasts in the qualification round advanced to the final round. In each round, the gymnasts performed four routines (ball, hoop, clubs, and ribbon), with the scores added to give a total.\nControversy in Russia.\nThe final result of the competition was considered controversial in Russia, as Israeli gold medalist Linoy Ashram dropped her apparatus during her ribbon routine. The Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) claims that she didn't receive a significant deduction (despite the fact that she did get a 0.700 deduction), which would have otherwise changed the standing due to the narrow score difference between Ashram and Russian silver medalist Dina Averina. Meanwhile, Olympic judges and supporters of Ashram note that Ashram's combined overall difficulty was over a point (+1.000) higher than Averina, allowing Ashram to score well even had she received a 1.000 point deduction for dropping the apparatus.\nAfter the results were in, the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) coaches submitted an inquiry on Dina Averina's ribbon score, but the score was left unchanged. Averina commented that she believed the judges were supporting Ashram and punishing herself, and she considers herself the champion. This position was universally supported by the Russian state-controlled media, which stated that Averina was the victim of \"political games\" and was purposefully denied gold, referring to it as \"the conspiracy against Russia\".\nTheir claims were dismissed by the international governing body, the FIG (International Gymnastics Federation), which confirmed that the FIG Rhythmic Gymnastics Technical Committee carried out a post-competition review of all evaluation components in every phase of the rhythmic gymnastics competition at Tokyo 2020. They stated:\"Following this process, we can confirm that no bias or irregularities were identified in the judging panels. The Rhythmic Gymnastics Technical Committee, therefore, confirms that the rankings and results of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games competitions in rhythmic gymnastics for both individuals and groups are fair and impartial.\nThe FIG has set up strict criteria for objective selection of the most qualified and unbiased judges for the Olympic Games and we are pleased by their work.\""

The season began on 11 April in Kazo, Japan and concluded on 15 November in Kranj, Slovenia.\nThe top 3 in each competition received medals, and the overall winners were awarded trophies. At the end of the season an overall ranking was determined based upon points, which athletes were awarded for finishing in the top 30 of each individual event.\nThe winners for bouldering were Kilian Fischhuber and Akiyo Noguchi, for lead Adam Ondra and Johanna Ernst, for speed Sergei Sinitcyn and Edyta Ropek, and for combined Adam Ondra and Akiyo Noguchi, men and women respectively.\nThe National Team for bouldering was France, for lead Austria, and for speed Russian Federation.\nHighlights of the season.\nIn bouldering, at the World Cup in Hall, Austria, Akiyo Noguchi of Japan and Anna Stöhr of Austria flashed all boulders in the final round, and because they were tied on countbacks too, they did a super final round where they both also flashed the boulder problem, eventually making them both joint winners.\nIn lead climbing, at the World Cup in Puurs, Belgium, Johanna Ernst of Austria, Jain Kim of South Korea, and Maja Vidmar of Slovenia were tied in the final round and tied on countbacks too, so they did a super final round where Johanna Ernst took the win.\nAdam Ondra of Czech Republic, at age sixteen, made his debut in the World Cup circuit in bouldering competition in Hall, Austria, placing third. He then competed in lead climbing, won 4 out of 6 Lead World Cups and the overall men's lead title of the season. He also won the men's combined title of the season."

He played in the first 4 games of the season, before being declared inactive in the next 12 contests. He appeared in 6 games and registered 2 special teams tackles.\nOn March 19, 2021, he was re-signed a one-year contract with the Cowboys. He was having problems with a turf toe in training camp and suffered a foot injury in the last preseason game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. On September 2, 2021, he was placed on injured reserve to start the season. He was activated on October 2, 2021. He was a backup and his most notable performance came in Week 9 against the Denver Broncos, where he almost made NFL history, by just missing a blocked punt in the third quarter (it didn't count because the Cowboys touched the ball after it crossed the line of scrimmage), that would've made him the first player ever to record 2 touchdown receptions and a blocked punt in a single-game. In Week 16 against the Washington Football Team, he had 3 receptions (including a 61-yard catch-and-run) for 82 yards and a touchdown, after playing just 13 offensive snaps.

The host nation (Peru) is guaranteed two quotas in the slalom events and it must qualify in sprint. A nation may enter a maximum of 6 athletes in slalom (three per gender) and 16 in sprint. The 2018 Pan American Canoe Sprint Championships and the 2019 Pan American Canoe Slalom Championships will be used to distribute the quotas.\nSlalom.\nA total of 44 quota spots are available in slalom (34 in slalom and 10 in extreme). The top 9 in each kayak event (including the host nation, Peru) will qualify along with the top 8 in each canoe event. An athlete can only compete in one slalom event (but can compete in two if the country has not qualified a spot in the other event). One wild card spot will also be allocated A further 5 spots will be available for each extreme event. All athletes qualified in slalom can compete in the extreme events. At the end of qualification, one spot in kayak women, women's extreme kayak and men's canoe slalom along with the wild card quota (for a total of four quotas) were not used.\nSprint.\nA total of 125 quotas were distributed. An athlete can only qualify one boat for their country. In each discipline the competitions will start with the larger boats and work their way down till the last event. In the second event and onward (if applicable) for each discipline, places can only be qualified by athletes that have not already qualified. Countries qualified in the largest boat per discipline/gender are required to compete in the smaller boats as well (even if they do not qualify additional athletes). This is summarized per event below. There will be 5 wild card spots handed out to countries that failed to qualify, but competed at the qualification tournament. An athlete qualifying in event can compete in another event, as long as no other boat from their country is competing.\nOnly one country did not qualify: Jamaica. They will be awarded with a wild card slot in the event their athlete competed. The other four wild card spots will be reallocated. The USA qualified one more athlete then the maximum allowed in men's kayak. That spot will be reallocated. In both canoe disciplines, both filled their quotas. In women's kayak 11 quota spots need to be reallocated. Argentina qualified an extra slot in kayak (11 in total) which will need to be reallocated, leaving a total of 17 spots to be reallocated.\nThree nations: Dominican Republic, Venezuela and host nation Peru received reallocated quotas even though they did not compete at the qualifiers."

Söderström was selected 11th overall by the Arizona Coyotes in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft.\nPlaying career.\nSöderström joined Brynäs IF as a 14-year old, playing through their junior ranks before he was elevated from the J20 SuperElit and made his professional debut in the Swedish Hockey League (SHL) at the age of 17 during the 2018–19 season on 18 October 2018. He was signed to his first professional contract by Brynäs, agreeing to a two-year deal through 2020 on 8 November 2018.\nOn 21 June 2019, Söderström was selected by the Arizona Coyotes of the National Hockey League (NHL), 11th overall in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft. The Coyotes traded up from the 14th overall with an additional second round pick to obtain the selection. Söderström signed a three-year, NHL entry-level contract with the Coyotes on 7 July 2019.\nIn the 2019–20 season, Söderström was assigned on loan by the Coyotes to continue his development with his Swedish club, Brynäs IF. He featured in 35 games from the blueline, reaching new career highs with 5 goals and 16 points in the regular season, before the playoffs were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Söderström returned to the Coyotes organization when he was added to the return-to-play roster and remained with the club through the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs but did not play.\nWith the 2020–21 North American season to be delayed, on 1 September 2020, Söderström returned to Sweden in joining second-tier club, AIK of the HockeyAllsvenskan, on loan until the commencement of the Coyotes 2020 training camp. He made 12 appearances with AIK, registering 6 points, before leaving his loan stint in the Allsvenskan to join the Swedish World Junior team. Once the North American season returned, Söderström missed Arizona's training camp but was named to the Coyotes' taxi squad. He made his NHL debut on 22 January 2021 versus the Vegas Golden Knights. Söderström scored his first NHL goal on 7 May 2021 against Josef Kořenář in a 5–2 win over the San Jose Sharks. He also played for Arizona's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Tucson Roadrunners, scoring two goals and ten points in 32 games.\nSöderström split the 2021–22 season between the Roadrunners and the Coyotes. He repeated the feat during the 2022–23 season, but got into 30 games with the Coyotes registering nine points. He was assigned to Tucson to start the 2023–24 season."

        "text": "The 2020 Survivor Series was the 34th annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on November 22, 2020, from the WWE ThunderDome, hosted at the Amway Center in Orlando, Florida. It was WWE's final PPV presented from the Amway Center during the COVID-19 pandemic as the ThunderDome was relocated to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida due to the start of the 2020–21 ECHL and NBA seasons. The theme of the event was brand supremacy and featured wrestlers from the two brands against each other—unlike the 2019 event, NXT was not included at this year's event. The event also celebrated the 30th anniversary of The Undertaker's WWE debut—his retirement ceremony closed the event. This was the fourth Survivor Series event to take place in the state of Florida (two events in Miami and one in Tampa).\nSeven matches were contested at the event, including one on the Kickoff pre-show. The card was highlighted by two traditional Survivor Series elimination matches: Raw's men's and women's teams were victorious over SmackDown's. In the main event match, SmackDown's Universal Champion Roman Reigns defeated Raw's WWE Champion Drew McIntyre. Also on the card, SmackDown Women's Champion Sasha Banks defeated Raw Women's Champion Asuka, and SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) defeated Raw Tag Team Champions The New Day (Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods). Raw won brand supremacy by winning four of the seven matches.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual professional wrestling event produced every November by WWE since 1987. The second longest running pay-per-view (PPV) event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, referred to as the \"Big Four\". The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. The 2020 event, which was the 34th Survivor Series, was scheduled to be held on November 22, 2020. In addition to airing on traditional pay-per-view worldwide, the event was available to livestream on the WWE Network.\nSince WWE reintroduced the brand split in July 2016, Survivor Series has centered around competition between wrestlers from Raw and SmackDown for brand supremacy. In addition to traditional Survivor Series matches between the brands, the champions of Raw face their SmackDown counterparts in non-title matches, which began at the 2017 event. The 2020 Survivor Series featured Raw's WWE Champion against SmackDown's Universal Champion, the Raw Women's Champion facing the SmackDown Women's Champion, Raw's United States Champion going against SmackDown's Intercontinental Champion, and the Raw Tag Team Champions facing off with the SmackDown Tag Team Champions.\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAccording to WrestleVotes, the 2020 Survivor Series event was planned to be held at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas. However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that began affecting the industry in mid-March, WWE had to present the majority of its programming from a behind closed doors set. Initially, Raw and SmackDown's television shows and PPVs were done at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida. A limited number of Performance Center trainees and friends and family members of the wrestlers were later utilized to serve as the live audience. In late August, these programs were moved to a bio-secure bubble called the WWE ThunderDome, hosted at Orlando's Amway Center. The select live audience was no longer utilized as the bubble allowed fans to attend the events virtually for free and be seen on the nearly 1,000 LED boards within the arena. Additionally, the ThunderDome utilized various special effects to further enhance wrestlers' entrances, and arena audio was mixed with that of the chants from the virtual fans.\nWWE's initial agreement with the Amway Center expired on October 31, but with the option to extend the contract with a two weeks notice. On October 12, \"PWInsider\" reported that the contract had been extended, with \"Fightful\" revealing the amended contract's expiration date as November 24. Survivor Series was subsequently the final WWE pay-per-view presented from the ThunderDome at the Amway Center, as WWE relocated to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida, which began with the December 11 episode of \"SmackDown\". This move was also done due to the start of the 2020–21 ECHL and NBA seasons as the Amway Center is the shared home of the Orlando Solar Bears (ECHL) and the Orlando Magic (NBA). \n\"411Mania\" reported that the COVID-19 pandemic was a reason that the NXT brand was not involved in the event, unlike the previous year. Outbreaks of the virus had occurred at both of NXT's home arenas, Full Sail University and then the WWE Performance Center, prompting WWE to exclude NXT wrestlers from the event to avoid potential transmission of the virus to members of the Raw and SmackDown rosters. This report was confirmed by WWE executive and NXT head Triple H during the media call on December 3.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised seven matches, including one on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"Friday Night SmackDown\".\nSurvivor Series elimination matches.\nQualifying matches for the men's Survivor Series elimination match began on the October 26 episode of \"Raw\". AJ Styles, Keith Lee, and Sheamus earned the first three spots on Team Raw by defeating Jeff Hardy, Elias, and Riddle, respectively. The following week, Braun Strowman qualified for the team by defeating Lee and Sheamus in a triple threat match. Riddle won the final spot on Team Raw by defeating Elias and Hardy in a triple threat match on the November 9 episode. Team SmackDown's first two members were determined on the October 30 episode of \"SmackDown\". Kevin Owens and Jey Uso qualified by defeating Dolph Ziggler and Daniel Bryan, respectively. The following week, King Corbin and Seth Rollins won the next two spots by defeating Rey Mysterio and Otis, respectively. On the November 20 episode, WWE official Adam Pearce named Otis as the final member of Team SmackDown.\nFor the women's Survivor Series elimination match, all five of Team Raw's members were initially revealed on the October 26 episode of \"Raw\". WWE officials Adam Pearce and Pat Buck announced that WWE Women's Tag Team Champions Nia Jax and Shayna Baszler, along with Mandy Rose and Dana Brooke, would represent Team Raw. The fifth and final spot was determined by a fatal four-way match that night, which Lana won by defeating Lacey Evans, Peyton Royce, and Nikki Cross. On the November 16 episode of \"Raw\", due to Jax and Baszler attacking Rose's arm during a tag team match, and then Retribution's Reckoning later attacking Brooke backstage, both Rose and Brooke were deemed unable to compete at Survivor Series, thus Pearce announced that they would be replaced by Evans and Royce. Team SmackDown's first member was determined on the October 30 episode of \"SmackDown\". Bianca Belair won the spot by defeating Billie Kay and Natalya in a triple threat match. Ruby Riott won the second spot on the following episode, where she defeated Natalya and Zelina Vega in a triple threat match. On the November 13 episode, Liv Morgan qualified by defeating Chelsea Green, Natalya, and Tamina in a fatal four-way match. The following week, Pearce added Bayley to the team, and Natalya defeated Tamina to win the final spot on Team SmackDown.\nChampions brand supremacy matches.\nAll four of the champions brand supremacy matches were announced on the October 26 episode of \"Raw\". At the time, it was announced that Raw's WWE Champion Randy Orton would face SmackDown's Universal Champion Roman Reigns, Raw Women's Champion Asuka would face SmackDown Women's Champion Sasha Banks, Raw's United States Champion Bobby Lashley would face SmackDown's Intercontinental Champion Sami Zayn, and Raw Tag Team Champions The New Day (Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods) would face SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford).\nOver the next few weeks, five of the champions defended their titles before Survivor Series, with four of them retaining to keep the matchups the same as initially announced. SmackDown Women's Champion Sasha Banks retained her title against Bayley on the November 6 episode of \"SmackDown\", Bobby Lashley retained the United States Championship against Titus O'Neil on the November 9 episode of \"Raw\", Intercontinental Champion Sami Zayn retained his title against Apollo Crews on the November 13 episode of \"SmackDown\", and The New Day retained their Raw Tag Team Championship against The Hurt Business (Cedric Alexander and Shelton Benjamin) on the November 16 episode of \"Raw\". Also during this time, SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Street Profits tried to get info on their Survivor Series opponents from former New Day member Big E, who told them that New Day would win. The men's world championship matchup, however, changed. After losing the WWE Championship to Randy Orton at Hell in a Cell on October 25, Drew McIntyre was given a rematch for the title. Prior to that, McIntyre appeared on the November 13 episode of \"SmackDown\" to confront Universal Champion Roman Reigns, despite not being the WWE Champion. On the November 16 episode of \"Raw\", McIntyre defeated Orton to regain the WWE Championship, thus becoming Reigns' opponent at Survivor Series.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nDuring the Survivor Series Kickoff pre-show, an 18-man dual-brand battle royal was contested, with its participants evenly divided between Raw and SmackDown. In the end, Raw's The Miz eliminated SmackDown's Dominik Mysterio to win the match, giving Raw the first win of the night.\nAlso during the pre-show, The Gobbledy Gooker, a character that also first appeared at the 1990 Survivor Series, pinned R-Truth to win the WWE 24/7 Championship.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with the men's 5-on-5 traditional Survivor Series elimination match, featuring Team Raw (AJ Styles, Keith Lee, Sheamus, Braun Strowman, and Riddle) (accompanied by Styles' bodyguard, Omos) against Team SmackDown (Kevin Owens, Jey Uso, King Corbin, Seth Rollins, and Otis). Jey and Styles started the match. After Sheamus tagged in the match, Rollins tagged in, got on his knees, and allowed Sheamus to perform a Brogue Kick on him: Rollins was subsequently eliminated, proclaiming it was \"for the greater good.\" After Rollins' elimination, the remaining SmackDown team members attempted to discuss a strategy outside the ring only for Strowman to tackle all of them with a running shoulder tackle. Back in the ring, Owens performed Stunners on Lee, Sheamus, and Riddle, after which, Styles performed a Phenomenal Forearm on Owens to eliminate him. Styles attacked Corbin with a superkick and Riddle performed a Floating Bro from the top rope to eliminate Corbin. After Otis performed the Caterpillar on Strowman, Otis attempted a Vader Bomb on Strowman only for Riddle to intercept Otis. Strowman took advantage of the distraction and performed a Running Powerslam on Otis to eliminate him. Jey attacked Team Raw with a flurry of Superkicks. In the end, Jey countered a Phenomenal Forearm from Styles and attempted a Splash on him; however, Lee, who was the legal member, intercepted Jey by catching him in midair and transitioned into a Spirit Bomb on Jey to win the match with a clean sweep, and giving Raw their second win of the night.\nNext, SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) faced Raw Tag Team Champions The New Day (Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods, accompanied by former stable member Big E from SmackDown); the trio came out dressed as their respective \"Gears 5\" characters, available as downloadable content for the game. Big E went backstage after the match began. After an evenly contested match between the two teams, The Street Profits performed an electric chair/blockbuster combination on Woods to win the match for SmackDown, giving SmackDown their first win of the night. Following the match, both teams showed mutual respect for each other.\nAfter that, Raw's United States Champion Bobby Lashley (accompanied by Hurt Business stablemates MVP, Cedric Alexander, and Shelton Benjamin) faced SmackDown's Intercontinental Champion Sami Zayn. Zayn refused to fight Lashley and attempted to walk away from the match, however, he was thwarted by The Hurt Business. In the closing moments, Zayn attempted to leave again, only for MVP to intercept him, after which, Zayn tried to convince the referee that MVP tripped him. MVP then threw Zayn back in the ring and Lashley applied the Hurt Lock on Zayn, who submitted, giving Raw their third win over SmackDown's one win.\nBackstage, while Jey Uso was conversing with his brother Jimmy Uso, Roman Reigns and Paul Heyman appeared. Reigns lambasted Jey for losing, after which, Jimmy tried to calm Reigns down. Reigns then ordered Jimmy to leave and stated that Team SmackDown lost because Jey could not control his team and that they did not respect Jey. He then told Jey to also leave the building along with Jimmy.\nIn the next match, Raw Women's Champion Asuka faced SmackDown Women's Champion Sasha Banks. In the end, after a series of attempted rollups on one another, Banks pinned Asuka with an inside cradle to win the match, giving SmackDown their second win of the night.\nIn a backstage segment, new 24/7 Champion The Gobbledy Gooker stumbled upon a trail of bird seed backstage. As The Gooker started to indulge with the seed, Akira Tozawa appeared and performed a roll-up on The Gooker to win the title. R-Truth then appeared and attacked Tozawa with a bag of bird seed and pinned him to regain the title.\nThe penultimate match was the women's 5-on-5 traditional Survivor Series elimination match, featuring Team Raw (Nia Jax, Shayna Baszler, Lana, Lacey Evans, and Peyton Royce) against Team SmackDown (Bianca Belair, Ruby Riott, Liv Morgan, Bayley, and Natalya). A few minutes into the match, Lana tagged in and faced off with Natalya. Jax then tagged in and Team Raw forced Lana to stand on the ring steps, not to tag in again. Bayley was the first to be eliminated after Royce performed Deja Vu on her and pinned her. Natalya then eliminated Royce by making her submit to the sharpshooter. Evans performed the Women's Right on Natalya to eliminate her. Baszler made Riott pass out to the Kirifuda Clutch and pinned Riott to eliminate her. Morgan then eliminated Evans with a crucifix pin. Morgan was then eliminated by Jax after Jax performed a Samoan Drop on her. The last remaining member of Team SmackDown, Belair, faced off with Baszler, who eventually applied the Kirifuda Clutch on Belair, who got to the ropes, but Baszler refused to let go of the hold as the referee counted to five, thus Baszler got herself eliminated by disqualification. Belair then fought with Jax. The two went outside the ring where Belair tumbled Jax over the ringside barrier; however, Belair did not make it back in the ring before the referee's count of ten, thus Jax and Belair were eliminated via count out, leaving Lana as the sole survivor of Team Raw. As this gave Raw their fourth win of the night, this automatically meant that Raw won brand supremacy.\nMain event.\nIn the main event match, Raw's WWE Champion Drew McIntyre faced SmackDown's Universal Champion Roman Reigns (accompanied by Paul Heyman). In the end, as McIntyre performed the Claymore on Reigns, Reigns inadvertently bumped into the referee, incapacitating him. Although he was instructed to leave the building earlier, Reigns' cousin Jey Uso then ran down to ringside and tussled with McIntyre, enabling Reigns to perform a low blow on McIntyre followed by a Superkick from Jey. Reigns then applied the guillotine choke submission on McIntyre, who passed out, to win the match. Although this gave SmackDown another win, Raw had already won brand supremacy with four wins to SmackDown's three.\nUndertaker retirement ceremony.\nThe 2020 Survivor Series saw the retirement ceremony of The Undertaker, who performed for WWE for 30 years, first making his debut for the promotion at the 1990 Survivor Series event. In what was the show's final segment, Shane McMahon, Big Show, John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield, Jeff Hardy, Mick Foley, The Godfather, The Godwinns (Henry and Phineas), Savio Vega, Rikishi, Kevin Nash, Booker T, Shawn Michaels, Ric Flair, Triple H, and Kane all entered the ring to kick off the ceremony. A video package recapping The Undertaker's career then aired, after which, WWE Chairman and CEO Vince McMahon was shown alone in the ring and gave a brief, heart felt message before introducing The Undertaker for the last time. The Undertaker then slowly walked to the ring in full costume where he then confirmed his retirement in an emotional farewell speech, stating \"My time has come to let The Undertaker \"Rest in Peace\"\". The Undertaker performed his trademark kneeling pose as an image of Undertaker's former longtime manager, the late Paul Bearer, appeared via hologram. The gong tolled ten times, officially putting an end to The Undertaker character. Undertaker delivered his trademark throat slash pose and then left the ring. The show ended with The Undertaker walking back up the entrance ramp to throw his fist up for one last time.\nAftermath.\nRaw.\nThe following night on \"Raw\", for winning the men's Survivor Series match with a clean sweep, WWE official Adam Pearce stated that one of Team Raw's members would receive a WWE Championship match against Drew McIntyre at and allowed each to state their case. The last to state their case was Braun Strowman, however, he became enraged over Pearce's use of the phrase \"last but not least\". This led to Strowman attacking Pearce and thus was suspended indefinitely. Former WWE Champion Randy Orton (who did not represent Raw at the pay-per-view but wanted a rematch) and United States Champion Bobby Lashley (who was the only champion from Raw to win his Champion vs. Champion match) each confronted Pearce backstage individually with their respective cases. Pearce scheduled three singles matches for that night, with the winners of each facing off in a triple threat match the following week to determine the number one contender. Riddle, Keith Lee, and AJ Styles advanced to the triple threat match by defeating Sheamus, Lashley, and Orton, respectively. Styles subsequently won the triple threat match.\nAlso on \"Raw\", due to Lana emerging the sole survivor of the women's elimination match, she was given a Raw Women's Championship match against Asuka. However, this match ended in a no-contest by an interference from Women's Tag Team Champions Nia Jax and Shayna Baszler. This led to a tag team match in which Lana and Asuka defeated Jax and Baszler in a non-title match. The following week, Lana and Asuka defeated Jax and Baszler in another non-title match, and a title match between the two teams was then scheduled for TLC.\nSmackDown.\nOn the following episode of \"SmackDown\", Universal Champion Roman Reigns lambasted Jey Uso for Team SmackDown losing, as well as returning to aid Reigns in his match against McIntyre, even though he ordered Jey to leave the building. Reigns stated that the rest of Team SmackDown did not respect Jey, and because of that, they do not respect Reigns or their family. This enraged Jey, who then attempted to further prove himself by viciously attacking Otis with a chair during his entrance. Later, he attacked Daniel Bryan backstage, causing Bryan to lose his match. In the main event, Jey faced Kevin Owens. Jey was intentionally disqualified after attacking Owens with a steel chair. After the match, Jey continued his assault on Owens, however, Owens retaliated by delivering multiple Stunners to Jey. Owens then taunted Reigns directly, who watched on from a television backstage. The following week, Owens challenged Reigns to a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match for the Universal Championship at TLC, and Reigns accepted."

The teams have met annually since 1977, usually in the early part of December.\nSeries history.\nThe series began on March 3, 1923, a 46–23 Creighton victory. The first seven games of the series took place sporadically throughout the 1920s and 1930s; no further games were scheduled until the late 1970s. Since 1977, Nebraska and Creighton have met at least once annually, a stretch of 43 consecutive seasons. The schools have met twice in postseason tournaments, both Nebraska wins in the opening round of the 1984 and 2004 NIT.\nSince Creighton has not had a football program since 1942, there are a significant number of Creighton basketball fans who also support Nebraska's football program. These fans are often derisively referred to by Nebraska fans as \"Jayskers,\" a portmanteau of \"Bluejays\" and \"Cornhuskers.\""

Conference play started in late December 2018 and concluded in March with the 2019 ACC men's basketball tournament at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. The season marks 65th season of Atlantic Coast Conference basketball.\nHead coaches.\nCoaches.\n\"Notes:\"\nPreseason.\nPreseason watchlists.\nBelow is a table of notable preseason watch lists.\nACC preseason media poll.\nCoaches, players, and the media met at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina for a media day on October 24, 2018. Players and coaches met the media, and coaches voted on the preseason conference poll and preseason All-ACC teams. Results of the polls are shown below.\nPreseason poll.\nFirst place votes shown in parentheses.\nRegular season.\nConference matrix.\nThis table summarizes the head-to-head results between teams in conference play. Each team will play 18 conference games, and at least 1 against each opponent. \nPlayer of the week.\nThroughout the conference regular season, the Atlantic Coast Conference offices named one or two Players of the week and one or two Rookies of the week.\nRecords against other conferences.\n2018–19 records against non-conference foes through games played on February 2, 2019. Records shown for regular season only.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe ACC had seven teams selected to the NCAA tournament. This was tied for second overall with the SEC. The ACC's three number one seeded teams ties an all-time record. The previous time one conference had three number one seeds was in 2009, when the Big East accomplished the feat.\nHonors and awards.\nAll-Americans.\nTo earn \"consensus\" status, a player must win honors based on a point system computed from the four different all-America teams. The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation. The top five totals plus ties are first team and the next five plus ties are second team.\nNBA draft.\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference had a record six players selected in the lottery picks of the NBA Draft. Their ten first round selections tied the record for most first round selections from a conference in a single year. Also, the ACC had the most selections of any conference in the draft (thirteen total). The ACC also became the first conference to have five top-ten picks in the modern draft era (since 1966)."

It was Tony McGahan's fourth and final season as Director of Rugby.\nSummary.\nMunster were drawn in Pool 1 of the 2011–12 Heineken Cup alongside Scarlets, Northampton Saints and Castres. Munster defeated Northampton 23–21 in their opening pool fixture on 12 November 2011, thanks to an 84th minute drop-goal from Ronan O'Gara. One week later, away from home against Castres, a last-gasp drop-goal from O'Gara again handed victory to Munster, this time 27–24. In the December double-header against Scarlets, Munster emerged victorious from both fixtures, firstly defeating the Welsh side 17–14 in the away leg, before winning 19–13 at home. In Round 5, Munster beat Castres 26–10 at Thomond Park to become the first side to qualify for the quarter-finals. A 51–36 win away from home against Northampton in the sixth and final round, including a hat-trick from Simon Zebo, secured a home quarter-final for Munster. However, in the quarter-final, Munster were beaten 22–16 at home by provincial rivals Ulster, ending their Heineken Cup campaign for the 2011–12 season.\nIn the 2011–12 Pro12, Munster finished third with 67 points, in a season that included 14 wins, 1 draw and 7 defeats after 22 regular matches. In the play-offs, Munster lost 45–10 away to eventual champions Ospreys, in a match that was Tony McGahan's final as Munster head coach. New Zealander Rob Penney was subsequently confirmed as Munster's new head coach."

It was the eighth iteration of the \"League of Legends\" World Championship, an annual international tournament organized by the game's developer, Riot Games. It was held from October 1 to November 3, 2018, in cities across South Korea. Twenty four teams qualified for the tournament based on their placement in regional circuits such as those in China, South Korea, Europe, and North America, with twelve of those teams having to reach the group stage via a play-in round. The tournament became known for its very surprising results, numerous upsets, and has often been considered the most unpredictable worlds in League of Legends' history. The tournament also became the most watched esports event in history, reaching a peak of over 200 million concurrent viewers during the finals. It surpassed the viewership of the 2017 League of Legends World Championship, as well as the peak viewership of numerous worldwide sporting events including the Super Bowl.\nThe tournament's opening ceremony received significant attention, with over 90 million concurrent viewers tuning in for the performance. A virtual K-pop group named K/DA was unveiled by Riot Games during the ceremony, with Soyeon and Miyeon from (G)I-dle, Madison Beer and Jaira Burns representing the group as its human counterpart and in the live performance of the finals. K/DA topped global music charts after the initial release of their debut song \"Pop/Stars\", receiving considerable attention online and raking in one of the fastest viewership records for its music video on YouTube. A dance practice video of \"Pop/Stars\", as popular in the K-pop scene, was also released. \"RISE\" is the tournament's theme song, put together by The Glitch Mob, Mako and The Word Alive. A remix version of \"RISE\" featuring Bobby from IKON was also released shortly after, with the song being performed on the tournament's finals by all the involved music groups and artists. The song would be performed again when Korea hosted the tournament for the second time in 2023.\nThe victory of China's Invictus Gaming over Europe's Fnatic in the tournament's finals marked the first time in League of Legends history that the LPL (China) as a region won the world championship, as well as the first time a non-LCK (Korean) team has won after five consecutive years of prior Korean winners. The final series is also the fastest world championship finals in history at 85 minutes total game time. Gao “Ning” Zhenning was awarded the MVP of the finals due to his outstanding performance and contributions during the series, marking the first time a jungle position player has won a world championship MVP.\nQualified teams.\nAlthough the South Korea (LCK) representative, Kingzone DragonX, lost to China's (LPL) representative Royal Never Give Up (LPL) in 2018 Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) Finals, all three teams from South Korea (LCK) started in the Main Group Stage, having won the 2017 Mid-Season Invitational and the previous two World Championships. With the results of 2018 MSI and following their separation from the rest of the Southeast Asian (SEA) region, Vietnam (VCS) had a direct seed into the Main Group Stage for the summer split victor in their region, but unlike the previous year, Vietnam had no additional slots in the Play-In Stage for their summer runner-up team, because of the 24 team limit. The North American (NA LCS) summer split champion team was seeded to Pool 2 due to their performance at the 2018 Mid-Season Invitational.\nVenues.\nSeoul, Busan, Gwangju, Incheon were the four cities chosen to host the competition."

        "text": "\"Surfing in a Hurricane\" is a song performed by American popular music singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett, and written by Buffett and Will Kimbrough. It is the ninth track from his 2009 album \"Buffet Hotel\".\nLive performances.\nThe song had been introduced to setlists over eleven months before its studio recording release on \"Buffet Hotel\". Its live debut was on January 13, 2009 at the Anegada Reef Hotel in Anegada, British Virgin Islands. \"Surfing in a Hurricane\" would remain in the setlist for every show during that year's Summerzcool Tour, where it would be promoted as Buffett's first surf song. While \"Surfing in a Hurricane\" was Buffett's first penned surf song, he actually did a surf rendition of \"Up on the House Top\" on his 1996 Christmas album \"Christmas Island\".\nHurricane Florence.\n\"Surfing in a Hurricane\" gained notability in September 2018 when Buffett tweeted that he would join Folly Beach surfers for one last ride before Hurricane Florence would hit. News outlets immediately noted Buffett's tweet as him bringing \"Surfing in a Hurricane\" to fruition; some fans responded to the tweet with concern for his safety, while others criticized Buffett for potentially influencing others to attempt a dangerous act. Shannon Green of the Orlando Sentinel called Buffett's tweet irresponsible, and noted that someone with such a large fanbase should be more careful how about influential his words are. However, some of this criticism is thought to derive from people not realizing his tweet was a direct quote from his song \"Surfing in a Hurricane\", and that he was not encouraging such reckless behavior. Buffett immediately sent an updated tweet, advising that nobody should attempt anything dangerous, respect mother nature and abide by the authority's warnings."

During his rookie season in 1997, Dillon rushed 39 times for 246 yards and 4 touchdowns in a 41-14 win over the Tennessee Oilers breaking Jim Brown's NFL rookie single game record that had stood for 40 years.

        "text": "Hengqin International Tennis Center () is a tennis stadium complex in Hengqin, Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China. It is operated by Huafa Sports, part of the Zhuhai Huafa Group. It currently hosts three international competitions: the WTA Elite Trophy, the Zhuhai Open and the Asia-Pacific Wildcard Playoff for the Australian Open.\nThe center covers a floor area of approximately 117,000 square meters. Its first phase, which was completed in 2015, is 68,000 square meters in area. It consists of a center court with a capacity for 5,000 spectators, one court accommodating 1,500 people, four smaller match courts, and twelve practice courts. It was purpose built for the WTA Elite Trophy, which was inaugurated in 2015. It was designed by the sporting architectural company Populous, which was also behind the Wimbledon Centre Court and the Margaret Court Arena in Melbourne Park. The first phase was begun only a year before the center opened, and involved draining and reclamation of the site before construction could begin. Because the WTA Elite Trophy is classified as an outdoor competition, the specifications included a requirement that all courts, indoor and outdoor, have the same climatic conditions in terms of temperature and humidity. Populous achieved this by designing a covered center court with two roofs: a cantilevered outer roof covering the stands, and a central roof covering the court, which allows natural light and ventilation while protecting players and spectators from direct sunlight and rain. The grounds were landscaped as a park, which is open to the public while tournaments are not taking place. The center opened in September 2015, two months before the 2015 WTA Elite Trophy, and hosted the $50,000 Zhuhai ITF Women's Pro Circuit, which subsequently combined with a men's tournament to become the Zhuhai Open. The Women's Tennis Association website reported that \"players and fans loved the new stadium, which offered excellent vantage points from every seat.\"\nThe center is in the central section of Henqin New Area. The Henqin New Area was developed, beginning in 2009, as an area of cooperation between the prefecture of Zhuhai and the special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong, under China's \"one country, two systems\" policy. Henqin and Macau are separated by only 200 meters, and there is a bridge between the two. Between August and December 2018, the Hengqin Tennis Center offered the use of its training facilities for free to all residents of Zhuhai, Macau and Hong Kong."

        "text": "The 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification process determined 30 of the 32 teams which will play in the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, with the co-hosts Australia and New Zealand qualifying automatically. It is the ninth FIFA Women's World Cup, the quadrennial international women's football world championship tournament. The tournament is the first Women's World Cup to be hosted in multiple countries, the third by an AFC member association after the 1991 and 2007 Women's World Cups in China, the first to be held in the Southern Hemisphere, the first senior FIFA tournament in Oceania, and also the first FIFA tournament to be hosted across multiple confederations (with Australia in the AFC and New Zealand in the OFC).\nThe field was expanded from 24 teams in the 2019 edition to 32 in the 2023 edition.\nQualified teams.\nOf the total 32 slots (29 direct and 3 playoffs), the following teams qualified directly to fill the 29 direct slots. The remaining 3 playoff slots were determined by the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (inter-confederation play-offs) held in February 2023 in New Zealand.\nQualification process.\nAfter the number of teams qualifying for the Women's World Cup was increased, a new slot allocation was approved by the Bureau of the FIFA Council on 24 December 2020. The slots for the host nations, Australia and New Zealand, were taken directly from the quotas allocated to their confederations, the AFC and OFC respectively.\nSummary of qualification.\nQualifying matches started in September 2021 and ended in February 2023. Matches have been played on dates within the FIFA International Match Calendar.\nApart from the hosts Australia and New Zealand, 207 of 209 remaining FIFA member associations could qualify through their own confederation's qualifying process if they choose to enter. The exceptions were Chad and Pakistan, whose football associations were suspended by FIFA. A third exception might have been Russia after initially receiving a four-year ban from all major sporting events by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) on 9 December 2019, after Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) was found non-compliant for handing over manipulated laboratory data to investigators. However, the Russian women's team could still enter qualification. The decision was appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which ruled in WADA's favour but reduced the ban to two years. The CAS ruling also allowed the name \"Russia\" to be displayed on uniforms if the words \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\" have equal prominence. Had Russia qualified for the tournament, its female players would have been able to use their country's name, flag or anthem at the Women's World Cup, unlike their male counterparts, as the ban scheduled to expire on 16 December 2022. But earlier on 28 February, FIFA and UEFA announced Russia's suspension from all competitions following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On 2 May, UEFA announced that Russia was no longer to continue participating in qualification, that their prior results were nullified, and that Group E continued with five teams.\nConfederation qualification.\nAFC.\nAs in the previous World Cup cycle, the AFC Women's Asian Cup served as the World Cup qualifying tournament for AFC members. The World Cup qualifying process was as follows:\nNorth Korea withdrew on 29 July 2021 from the Women's Asian Cup qualifiers due to COVID-19 pandemic-related safety concerns, followed by Turkmenistan on 6 August because of pandemic-related travel restrictions. In a letter to the AFC published on 8 September, Iraq decided not to take part. Afghanistan also withdrew from qualification later in September as the women's team's participation was uncertain due to the Taliban takeover of the country.\nDuring the Women's Asian Cup, host team India was unable to play their second group stage match against Chinese Taipei due to having fewer than 13 players available, with the remaining team members testing positive for COVID-19. They were considered to have withdrawn from the competition, and all previous matches played by them were considered \"null and void\" and were not considered in determining the final group rankings.\nPlay-offs.\n&lt;section begin=RP0 /&gt;The format of the play-off round depended on the performance of Australia, who qualified automatically for the World Cup as hosts. Since Australia was eliminated in the quarter-finals, the play-offs format was for the remaining three quarter-final losers to play a single round-robin play-off. The best team after three matches advanced to the World Cup, and the remaining two teams entered the inter-confederation play-offs.\nCAF.\nAs in the previous World Cup cycle, the Women's Africa Cup of Nations served as the World Cup qualifying tournament for CAF members. The World Cup qualifying process was as follows:\nCONCACAF.\nAs in the previous World Cup cycle, the CONCACAF W Championship served as the World Cup qualifying tournament for CONCACAF members. The World Cup qualifying process was as follows:\nCONMEBOL.\nThe Copa América Femenina was held from 8–30 July 2022, providing three direct qualifying places and two play-off places for the Women's World Cup. The top two teams from each group advanced to the knockout stage, from which the winners of the and third place matches qualified for the World Cup. The loser of the third place match advanced to the . The third-placed teams from each group played a fifth place play-off, the winner of which also advanced to the .\nOFC.\nThe OFC Women's Nations Cup was held from 13 to 30 July, with Fiji hosting the tournament. It was originally scheduled for July and August 2022, but was shifted to January and February 2022 to accommodate changes to the FIFA Women's International Match Calendar. It was subsequently pushed back to July due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNew Zealand did not take part as they had already qualified for the World Cup as co-hosts, and American Samoa opted not to participate due to continuing difficulties related to the pandemic. The remaining nine teams were ranked according to the 25 March world rankings and drawn into three groups on 10 May, from which the top two teams in each group and the top two third place teams advanced to the knockout stage. Papua New Guinea advanced to the inter-confederation play-offs as tournament winners.\nUEFA.\nThe World Cup qualifying process is as follows:\nPlay-offs.\nRanking of play-off winners\nInter-confederation play-offs.\nThe final three spots at the FIFA Women's World Cup were decided through a ten-team play-off tournament. The tournament was used as a test event for New Zealand to host prior to the Women's World Cup.\nIn the play-off draw, four teams were seeded into groups based on the FIFA Women's World Rankings, with a maximum of one seeded team per confederation. Teams from the same confederation were not drawn into the same group. The winner of each group qualified for the FIFA Women's World Cup."

        "title": "Cycling Without Age",
        "text": "Cycling Without Age (CWA) is a nonprofit organization founded in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2012. By 2020, this initiative had expanded into 50 countries, serving over 1.5 million people worldwide.\nThe purpose of \"Cycling Without Age\" is: \"to realise the dream of creating a world in which the easy access to active citizenship creates happiness among our elderly citizens and gives them an opportunity to remain an active part of the local community.\"\nUnder the motto \"The right to wind in your hair\", \"Cycling Without Age\" offers recreational mobility to seniors, in the form of volunteer-piloted trishaw rides. This type of common activity promotes communication between the senior passengers and their riders (called \"pilots\"), thus facilitating the goal of the initiative: \"we build bridges between generations, we reinforce trust, respect and the social glue in our society\".\n\"Cycling Without Age\" has chapters throughout the world. Each chapter is typically at the service of a specific nursing home. The trishaw rides are offered by local volunteer pilots. These rides enable seniors with limited mobility to explore their neighbourhood and the surrounding nature.\nHistory.\nThe history of \"Cycling Without Age\" began in Copenhagen in 2012 when the 47-year-old social entrepreneur Ole Kassow cycled to work every day. On his way he noticed an elderly gentleman sitting in front of a senior citizens' home. This encounter stuck in his memory. Later, when looking at historical pictures of his hometown, he wondered whether this gentleman used to enjoy cycling in his younger years as much as Ole himself did nowadays. After thinking about it for a while, an idea formed in his mind: Ole rented a trishaw, rode it to the senior citizens' home and offered a ride. An elderly lady and her caregiver were his passengers on the first trishaw trip.\nThe route took them to sites the elderly lady knew from years gone by. She told him stories from that time and was very happy to see these places again. The trip was a great success and soon other residents of the home wanted a ride with the trishaw. With the support of the residence's management, a spontaneous idea became a regular leisure-time facility.\nWhen Ole Kassow wrote to the city council of Copenhagen and asked for the financing of the trishaw for the senior citizens' home, he surprisingly found support there too: five trishaws were ordered in one fell swoop. With a parade of the new trishaws in April 2013, the initiative was presented to the public - two television stations and various newspapers reported.\nOle Kassow's idea gave rise to the initiative \"\" which spread quickly in Denmark and soon afterwards in many countries around the world. As of March 2020, there were 2200 regional chapters with over 3000 trishaws in more than 50 countries in Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia (including New Zealand).\nOften a \"Cycling Without Age\" chapter is formed in a neighbourhood area. That group then organizes a trishaw and makes it available for excursions to surrounding senior citizens' facilities and other social institutions. Volunteers are instructed in the handling of the trishaw and make themselves available as pilots in their free time. Other \"Cycling Without Age\" chapters are associated with a specific social institution and serve only that facility.\nImpact.\nA 2018 study at the in Barcelona, Spain, reported that all 14 participants felt that the relationship with the volunteer pilot was very positive. The majority \"loved the trips, felt more motivated and would recommend CWA. The main reasons they liked CWA\" was \"going out for a ride and get distracted.\"\nIn 2019, a study by the German (Institute for Education, Upbringing and Guidance) found that the trips offered by \"Cycling Without Age\" generally have a positive effect on older people. The passengers benefit from the many new social contacts and perceive the outings as an enrichment for their everyday life. With the extended range of travel, they can experience the great outdoors again and visit places they have fond memories of. In particular, however, the passengers enjoy the conversations with the trishaw pilot and other people they meet. \nDue to the special design of the trishaws used by \"Cycling Without Age\" (passengers in front, rider at the back), communication is possible at any time without any problems: 'The social isolation, which is a major hurdle in everyday life for many seniors, is inevitably reduced or even dissolved by \"Cycling Without Age\" — from which not only the seniors, but also the pilots themselves benefit enormously. The positive experiences with the pilots are also very far-reaching. They lose fear of contact with the older generation and learn to interact with them in a casual and relaxed manner. The drivers can combine sporting activity with social commitment and also have important interpersonal experiences.'\nA 2019 impact study from Singapore found that nursing home residents experienced an increase in self-reported mood and outlook on life of 80% after 5 rides. Among young volunteers the report found a 36% increase in comfort level communicating and interacting with seniors.\nA 2020 study in Scotland also looked at the effects of the \"Cycling Without Age\" initiative on the mood and well-being of residents in senior citizens' facilities: \"Analyses revealed significant improvements in mood and wellbeing at follow-up on ride days versus no ride days.\"\nReports in the media confirm the positive impacts of trishaw outings with seniors and their drivers: \"It creates extraordinary experiences for them. They come out of that building and they get that wind in their hair and they are smiling from ear to ear.\" \"Many of the passengers talk about the joy of having the wind in their hair again. Some passengers have told me after a ride 'I am so happy' which makes me tear up!\"\nPrinciples.\nAll trips with the senior citizens are always free. This is based on the five guiding principles of \"Cycling Without Age\": \nThe trips with senior citizens' facilities are carried out by volunteers in their free time. The communication between the passengers and their pilots is very important, so a special type of trishaw is used where the passengers sit in front and can clearly hear what the pilot says, and where the pilots can easily understand their passengers' stories. This facilitates the development of a relationship between passengers and pilots. By riding slowly and leisurely, they together experience and enjoy the landscape and cityscape along the chosen route intensively.\n\"Cycling Without Age\" thus supports the following Sustainable Development Goals, set in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly:\nOrganization.\nThe umbrella organization of \"Cycling Without Age\" is a non-political, not-for-profit association with its place of business in Copenhagen, Denmark. It coordinates all world-wide activities, provides a Brand Book and a visual identity package, hosts web and IT infrastructure, consults with trishaw manufacturers, supports research and development, offers presentations and workshops, and publishes documentation about the initiative.\nSome countries — especially those with many local chapters — have formed a national umbrella organization. These umbrella organizations provide regional support to new and existing chapters by counseling, organizing events, providing country-specific social media channels and access to a research and knowledge bank, as well as training to staff, pilots and instructors.\nSometimes, long excursions are organized by the regional organizations, for example, in 2014 from Odense (Denmark) to Hamburg (Germany), in 2015 from Rønde (Denmark) to Arendal (Norway), in 2019 along the Rhine river from Lake Constance to Bonn (Germany). \nLocal chapters may be organized at a specific senior citizens' facility, as a community initiative, or by a local parish. \"Captains\" at each site are experienced pilots: they are responsible for the trishaw, organize the trips, recruit and train new pilots. There are different ways in which chapters are organized, arrange the communication between pilots and their passengers, and finance the trishaw and its maintenance. Local chapters may have regular meetings, provide first-aid classes, and engage in public relations events."

It fields a representative side that competes in the Inter-Services tournament with the Army Rugby Union and the Royal Navy Rugby Union.\nHistory.\nThe founding of the RAFRU relies much on the shoulders of William Wavell Wakefield. He joined the Royal Navy Air Service but on the formation of the Royal Air Force in April 1918 he transferred to them. He was one of the founders of the RAFRU; and in its early years a driving force:- he was a player, captaining the team; a selector; and the secretary of the RAFRU.\nHe played in 8 Inter-Service matches for the club, captaining the side in all the matches. His last two matches for RAFRU were particularly noteworthy.\nThe RAFRU played its first Inter-Service match at Twickenham Stadium on 14 February 1923. This was against the Royal Navy Rugby Union. They beat the Navy 3–0 in the match. Another Inter-Service match was organised against the Army Rugby Union on 10 March 1923, again at Twickenham, and again RAFRU were victorious, winning the match 13-5 and becoming Twickenham's Inter-Service champions at the first time of asking.\nThe RAF-Army match was Wakefield's last match as a player for RAFRU. That same year he was called up to the England squad.\n100th Anniversary year.\n2018 became a notable year for the club as they beat both the Army and Navy sides, becoming Inter-Service Champions for the first time since 1994.\nWomen's side.\nThe RAFRU run a women's side.

In the final penultimate climber Jessica Pilz was the first to top the route. Janja Garnbret came out as the last climber and topped the route as well. As both climbers had the same first tiebreaker by virtue of having topped the semi-final route the ranking was decided by their time on the final route, which Pilz had climbed faster and thus was awarded the gold medal. Bronze went to Kim Ja-in.\nMen.\n124 athletes attended the men's lead competition. Adam Ondra and Jakob Schubert achieved the same score (36+) on the final route. Innsbruck-born Schubert won the gold medal due to his better tie-breaker, having achieved the better score in the semi-final.

The reigning champion, Tomoa Narasaki, and the World Cup seasonal winner, Jernej Kruder, missed the cut to the final.\nCombined.\nIn the Combined competition the six most successful athletes of the previous competitions competed against each other in Speed, Bouldering and Lead. The athletes were selected by multiplying each athletes rank from the three individual competitions. The six climbers with the lowest scores determined by this method were invited to compete in the Combined final. In the final itself the athletes were again ranked by multiplying their rank in the Speed, Bouldering and Lead portion with a lower score leading to a better Combined rank.\nThe women's and men's combined final were both held at the Olympiaworld, the women's on 15 September and the men's on 16 September."

        "text": "Adrian Martinez (born January 7, 2000) is an American football quarterback for the Birmingham Stallions of the United Football League (UFL). He played college football at Kansas State and Nebraska.\nEarly years.\nMartinez attended the Clovis West High School in Fresno, California. He played both football and basketball in high school. He missed his senior season of football due to a torn labrum he suffered while playing basketball. As a junior, he was the \"Fresno Bee\" football player of the year after he passed for 2,562 yards with 25 touchdowns and rushed for 1,462 yards and 14 touchdowns.\nMartinez was regarded as a four-star prospect and was the seventh-highest-ranked dual-threat quarterback in the class of 2018 according to the 247Sports Composite. Martinez originally committed to play college football at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Tennessee before ultimately deciding on the University of Nebraska.\nCollege career.\nNebraska.\n2018.\nFirst-year Nebraska head coach Scott Frost named Martinez the starting quarterback heading into the 2018 season opener, making him the first true freshman to ever begin a season as the starting quarterback at Nebraska. In the Cornhuskers' opening game against Colorado, Martinez threw for 187 yards, one touchdown, and an interception, and added 117 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns on the ground. Nebraska lost the game 33–28. Martinez went down with a knee injury in the final minutes of the Colorado game, an injury that also caused him to miss the following game against Troy, which also ended in a loss for Nebraska. Martinez returned from injury but could not help the Cornhuskers return to winning form, as the team lost its first six games of the year for the worst start to a season in program history. Martinez's first career win came against Minnesota, where he threw for 276 yards and three passing touchdowns, and ran for another touchdown on the ground in the 53–28 victory. He was named Big Ten Co-Freshman of the Week (with Rondale Moore) for the performance.

After a lackluster performance in the week two loss at Northwestern, head coach Scott Frost decided to start redshirt freshman Luke McCaffery in the upcoming game vs. Penn State. Martinez would return to the field just one game later in the 4th quarter of the Illinois game, after McCaffery threw his third interception of the contest. Martinez would remain the starter for the rest of the season, where he showed improvement from his first two starts. The final game of the season at Rutgers was his best game, where he completed 24 of 28 passes for 255 yards, 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions. In that game he also had an additional 181 rushing yards, with 2 rushing touchdowns.\nIn seven games, Martinez finished his abbreviated junior season with 1,055 passing yards, 4 passing touchdowns, and three interceptions.

        "text": "Sam Crawford (born April 18, 1970) is an American former professional basketball player. An agile and diminutive point guard at 5 ft 8 in tall, he attended Moorpark community college for two years before transferring to a Division I program, New Mexico State. In 1992–93 he led the NCAA in assists with a 9.1 average, was awarded the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award for the best college player under 6 ft and was an AP Honorable Mention. He is the all-time assists leader at New Mexico State with 592. After his senior year of college he went undrafted in the 1993 NBA draft and had a short professional career in the CBA. He also appeared in two movies: \"Blue Chips\" and \"Forget Paris\".\nHigh school career.\nCrawford was born in Illinois to Debra Crawford; his biological father abandoned the family when Crawford was 3, and he was raised by his mother in Harvey, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. Crawford's aunt Mita married former NBA player Ron Carter, and Crawford usually spent his summers in Los Angeles, California with the two, playing in basketball camps. When he was 10, his mother decided that he should move in with Carter, in an attempt to keep his son away from a life of poverty.\nCrawford attended Westchester High School in Los Angeles and he was one of the best players of the team together with Zan Mason, a \"Parade\" All-American and highly ranked prospect who would later play for UCLA. Crawford entered the starting five at Westchester in his freshman year, after a particularly good performance against Crenshaw, one of the top high school basketball teams in the area.\nCrawford and Mason led Westchester, and Crawford was named in the All-City team twice. In his junior season he averaged 17.4 points and 8.6 assists per game; in that same year, his aunt Mita and Carter divorced, and he refused to move with Carter in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles: he then spent a period living on the streets of Westchester, and sometimes at his teammates' houses, working odd jobs. During his senior season of high school, Crawford had a personally successful season, but the team only finished with a 16–6 record.\nCollege career.\nHe was recruited by Texas Tech and New Mexico State, but he was struggling with grades at Westchester and stopped attending classes after the end of the basketball season. At the end of his senior year he did not qualify academically, and according to Proposition 48 he could not attend a Division I college, having to sit out one year; after briefly attending Howard College in Big Spring, Texas, he decided to attend Moorpark College in Ventura County, California.\nCrawford immediately found success at Moorpark, and was the best player of the team, scoring 20.7 points per game and averaging 12.1 assists (411 total) in his freshman season. He led the conference in assists and scored a school-record 49 points against Ventura College. In his sophomore season he played 27 games, totalling 357 assists with an average of 13.2, and averaged 19.4 points. He recorded a triple double with 24 points, 19 assists and 11 steals against Glendale on January 3, 1991. His performances at Moorpark caught the attention of Gar Forman, assistant coach at New Mexico State, who called Crawford and asked him to join the Aggies for the 1991–92 season.\nCrawford transferred to New Mexico State and was named the starting point guard: he played 33 games, averaging 12.9 points and 8.5 assists with a field goal percentage of .420 (.401 from three). He led the nation in assists for most of his junior season, but ultimately finished second: while Crawford had the most assists (282), Van Usher of Tennessee Tech had a better average at 8.8 per game. He was named MVP of the 1992 Big West Conference tournament won by the Aggies. His 282 assists were a single-season school record at New Mexico State at the time.\nCrawford's senior season in college was the most successful of his career.\nOn December 21, 1992 he recorded 20 assists against Sam Houston State, only 2 shy of the all-time NCAA record of 22. Crawford led the Aggies in scoring and the entire NCAA in assists, being the top player both in total assists and in per-game average (9.1). He also recorded New Mexico State's single-season record with his 310 assists, breaking his own record established during the previous season. At the end of the season he won the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award for best player under 6 ft in college basketball, and he was named an All-American Honorable Mention by Associated Press.\nHe is the all-time assists leader at New Mexico State with a total of 592, despite having played there only for two seasons.\nCollege statistics.\n\"Source\"\nProfessional career.\nIn the days leading to the 1993 NBA draft Crawford was projected as a late second round pick, and he took part in Pre-Draft camps in Phoenix, Arizona. However, he ended up being not drafted by an NBA franchise.\nCrawford then decided to join the Continental Basketball Association and signed for the Hartford Hellcats where he started 2 of 23 games, averaging 9.0 points, 6.7 assists and 1.1 steals in 25.2 minutes per game. During the same season he transferred to the Wichita Falls Texans where he was a starter (15 out of 18 games) and averaged 14.5 points, 9.9 assists and 0.9 steals in 37.9 minutes. In 1994 he played in the Liga Profesional de Baloncesto in Venezuela where he led the league in assists per game at 11.1 (267 in 24 games), the all-time league record for highest assists per game average in a single season. His last team in the CBA were the Grand Rapids Mackers where he only played 3 games, averaging 3.0 points and 0.3 assists in the 1994–95 season."

It was designed by J. Kirkpatrick and built from 1900. The property is owned by the Sydney Cricket and Sports Ground Trust, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.\nThe area occupied by the stands were previously Aboriginal land, a water reserve, community facility, showground, and cricket ground.\nHistory.\nIn 1811 Governor Macquarie proclaimed Sydney’s second Common, an area of .\nThe establishment of the Sydney Cricket Ground dates from 1854 when matches were played there by members of the military from Victoria Barracks. From 1876 all major cricket matches were played at these grounds. The earliest grandstands date from around the turn of the century when four grandstands were constructed. Of these, only the Members Stand and the Lady Members Stand survive.\nThe Members’ Stand, a large two level grandstand was constructed and designed by architect, John Kirkpatrick. The stand incorporates an earlier three storey stuccoed brick club room at the rear. The original Members’ Stand was built in 1878 in the north west corner where the current Members‘ Stand now sits. The Members’ Stand was rebuilt on its current site at a cost of .\nOn 3 May 1896 the foundation stone of the Lady Members’ Stand was set by Viscountess Hampden, Susan Henrietta Cavendish, wife of the then NSW Governor Henry Brand, 2nd Viscount Hampden. The completed stand was opened later that same year, along with a concrete cycling track which circled the inside of the ground. Like the Members' Stand, the Lady Members' Stand, commonly called the Ladies' Pavilion, is an elegant two level grandstand constructed of cast iron and with an extensive three-storey members' room at the rear.\nFrom 1920 to 1937, the dominant visual elements of the (adjacent) Sydney Showground complex by this time were the peripheral walls. The iconic Members’ Stand clock tower and tower of the Anthony Hordern Building.\nDescription.\nTimber, brick and cast iron column and truss grandstands with ornate cast iron balustrades and green painted corrugated iron roofs. The stands are accessed via Gate A located on Driver Avenue.\nCondition.\nAs at 4th February 2024, condition is good.\nHeritage listing.\nAs at 1 September 2000 the stands have consistency of form and detail and are possibly the finest examples of their type in New South Wales.\nThe Sydney Cricket Ground Members' Stand and Lady Members' Stand was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999."

        "text": "Charles Allphin Austin (June 3, 1892 – March 15, 1980) was an American rugby union player, official, and coach who played center for the United States men's national team in its first two capped matches in 1912 and 1913. Austin also served as coach of the United States team that won the gold medal at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris.\nBiography.\nCharles Austin was born on June 3, 1892, in Bellingham, Washington, the son of William Charles Austin. Austin attended Berkeley High School, where he played for the school's rugby team and was named to a regional all-star team following the 1911 season. By 1912, he had joined the Olympic Club and played in the team's match against Australia during their 1912 tour of the United States and Canada. On November 16, 1912, Austin played for the United States at center in its first capped match—a 12–8 loss to Australia.\nIn 1913, Austin began attending Stanford University, where he and Daniel Carroll were among the members of the freshman class that played for the university's rugby team. While with the Stanford team, he competed against New Zealand during their 1913 tour of the United States and Canada. On November 15, 1913, Austin returned to the United States team and played again at center in its first test match against New Zealand—a 51–3 defeat.\nIn 1916, Austin became the coach of the rugby team at Santa Clara University. It was originally announced that he would return to coach the team for the 1917 season, but he did not. Also during the 1916 rugby season, Austin served as head linesman for the California high school state championship game. In 1924, Austin coached the United States national team at the Summer Olympics in Paris—a competition in which the Americans won the gold medal for a second consecutive Games.\nOn March 15, 1980, Charles Austin died in Marin, California at the age of 87."

For the elite round, the 16 teams were drawn into four groups of four, containing one best-four ranked main round group winner according to the coefficient ranking (seeding position 1), one other main round group winner (seeding position 2), and two main round group runners-up (seeding positions 3 or 4). First, a draw was held to select the four hosts from the seven potential hosts, which were allocated to their respective group as per their seeding positions. Next, the remaining 12 teams (including potential hosts not selected) were drawn from their respective pot which were allocated according to their seeding positions (group runners-up, including hosts, were allocated to first seeding position 4, then seeding position 3). Teams from the same main round group could be drawn in the same group. Based on the decisions taken by the UEFA Emergency Panel, Russia and Ukraine could not be drawn in the same group.\nFor the play-offs, the four elite round group runners-up, whose identity was not known at the time of the draw, were drawn into two ties without any seeding.

The play-offs were originally scheduled to be played on 9 and 12 April 2020, but had been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, initially to a later date tentatively between June and mid-August. On 17 June 2020, UEFA announced that the matches had been rescheduled to be played between 2 and 11 November 2020.\nTimes are CET (), as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses).\n\"4–4 on aggregate.

The event has drawn criticism due to the involvement of Saudi Arabia's government in the event, based on their record of human rights within the country and their ventures of sportswashing. This included paying large appearance fees to some of the world's top players.\nThe tournament ceased to be a European Tour event after the 2021 edition, and later that year it was announced that as a result, the PGA Tour would not allow their members to compete in future editions, with the European Tour expected to do the same. In September 2021, it was announced that it would become part of the Asian Tour's schedule. This involved a ten-year deal starting in 2022, with an increased prize fund of . In October, it was announced that the event would become the flagship event of the Asian Tour. In December, the PGA Tour revealed that they would grant their members releases to play in the event in 2022; on the condition that they committed to play in the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in some form in the following years.\nIn January 2022, it was announced that the Saudi Public Investment Fund had become the new title sponsor of the event."

        "text": "The 2018 Breeders' Cup Classic was the 35th running of the Breeders' Cup Classic, part of the 2018 Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships program. It was run on November 3, 2018, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky with a purse of $6,000,000. It was won by Accelerate, who earned his fifth Grade I win of the year.\nThe race was broadcast on NBC with a scheduled post time of 5:44 PM (EDT).\nThe Classic is run on dirt at one mile and one-quarter (approximately 2000 m). It is run under weight-for-age conditions, with entrants carrying the following weights:\nContenders.\nPre-entries for the 2018 Classic were announced on October 24 with the post position draw held on October 29.\nThe field for the 2018 Classic was weakened when the likely Horse of the Year, Justify, was retired in July. Justify won the American Triple Crown and his connections were hoping to complete the Grand Slam of Thoroughbred racing by also winning the Classic. However, a slight injury derailed those plans. Good Magic, winner of the Haskell Invitational and the 2017 champion two-year-old, was also retired due to injury. The connections of another leading contender, Whitney Stakes winner Diversify, opted to bypass the Classic when his trainer, Rick Violette, became ill and subsequently died.\nIn their absence, the race was considered highly competitive. Nineteen horses were pre-entered on October 24, though several of those had first preference in other races on the Breeders' Cup card. The leading contenders included:\nRace description.\nA poor start resulted in the horses with inside posts (Thunder Snow, Roaring Lion, Catholic Boy, Gunnevera) all being bumped and losing position. Yoshida and Lone Sailor also broke poorly and settled at the back of the pack. On the other hand, Mendelssohn broke well from post position nine and worked his way to the rail. He took the lead going into the first turn over McKinzie, with West Coast and Thunder Snow close behind.\nAccelerate, who broke from the outside post position, was urged by jockey Joel Rosario to get early position, then rated in fifth place around the first turn and down the backstretch. After starting his move down the far turn, he drew by Mendelssohn at the top of the stretch, then turned back a bid from Thunder Snow. Gunnevera mounted a late charge to take second place, a length behind Accelerate.\nAccelerate's trainer John Sadler earned his first win at the Breeders' Cup in 45 attempts spread out over 30 years. \"I'm thrilled\", said Sadler. \"In order to get the big one, you couldn't ask for a better day.\"\nWith the win, Accelerate solidified his chances to win the Eclipse Award for Champion Older Male Dirt Horse, and sparked a debate in the Horse of the Year category. Accelerate won five Grade I races over the year, compared to four such wins for Justify. Justify's wins included the American Triple Crown, while Accelerate became the first horse to win the Santa Anita Handicap, Gold Cup at Santa Anita, Pacific Classic and Awesome Again, in addition to the Breeders' Cup Classic. \"This horse (Accelerate) is special. He's showed up every time. He's danced every dance. He's been solid\", said his owner Kosta Hronis. \"This is Horse of the Year. It's a body of work, and what he has done in the last 12 months, I think he's well deserved to be of that honor. There's no doubt.\"\nAntonio Sano was equally proud of his trainee, Gunnevera. \"He ran second and had lost a couple lengths at the start\", he pointed out. \"They sandwiched my horse. Every time we are closer and closer to winning a grade 1. He's going to race in 2019 and will point to the Pegasus.\" That race is also under consideration for Accelerate, who will then head off to stud.\nResults.\nTimes: – 0:22.68; – 0:46.46; – 1:10.61; mile – 1:35.90; final – 2:02.93.&lt;br&gt;\nFractional Splits: (:22.68) (:23.78) (:24.15) (:25.29) (:27.03)\nSource: Equibase Chart\nPayout.\nPayout Schedule:"

        "title": "2017 IFSC Climbing World Cup",
        "text": "The 2017 IFSC Climbing World Cup was held in 15 locations. Bouldering competitions were held in 7 locations, lead in 8 locations, and speed in 7 locations. The season began on 7 April in Meiringen, Switzerland and concluded on 12 November in Kranj, Slovenia.\nThe top 3 in each competition received medals, and the overall winners were awarded trophies. At the end of the season an overall ranking was determined based upon points, which athletes were awarded for finishing in the top 30 of each individual event.\nThe winners for bouldering were Chon Jong-won and Shauna Coxsey, for lead Romain Desgranges and Janja Garnbret, and for speed Vladislav Deulin and Anouck Jaubert, men and women respectively.\nHighlights of the season.\nIn lead climbing, Janja Garnbret of Slovenia was the only athlete who never missed a podium in all 8 lead competitions of the season.\nIn speed climbing, at the first Speed World Cup of the season in Chongqing, Iuliia Kaplina of Russia set a new world record of 7.46 seconds, breaking her previous world record of 7.53 seconds she set at the 2015 Speed World Cup in Chamonix.\nThen the next week, at the World Cup in Nanjing, Reza Alipour of Iran and Russia's Iuliia Kaplina set new world records on their way to the men's and women's speed titles of 5.48 and 7.38 seconds respectively. The previous world record for the men was set at 5.60sec by Danyil Boldyrev of Ukraine at the IFSC World Championships in 2014, while for the women was 7.46sec by Iuliia Kaplina herself just a week before in Chongqing.\nChanges from the previous season.\nFor the 2017 season, the IFSC changed the timing method for the finals of World Cup tournaments. First, climbing time for lead finals was reduced from eight to six minutes. Second, climbing time for bouldering finals was reduced from four minutes plus to four minutes dead. This means climbers can no longer continue their attempt after the four minute mark, even if they're off the mats before the clock runs out, which was the previous rule.\nStreaming controversy.\nBefore the start of the 2017 season, the IFSC announced that they had signed a three-year contract with the streaming platform FloSports, which would have made the streams of climbing World Cups available only to paying customers instead of being freely accessible. This led to an online petition asking the IFSC to change their deal with FloSports, which was signed by more than 12,000 people, and an open letter by the Athletes' Commission. The Commission voiced their frustration over the way the IFSC had previously communicated with the community at large, and \"asked the athletes to withdraw cooperation with the livestream media until changes are made\". On the next day the IFSC apologized for having made a mistake, and announced that the deal with FloSports had not actually been signed yet despite the earlier press release, and would not be concluded.\nBouldering.\nAn overall ranking was determined based upon points, which athletes were awarded for finishing in the top 30 of each individual event.\nMen.\n6 best competition results were counted \"(not counting points in brackets)\" for IFSC Climbing World Cup 2017.\nWomen.\n6 best competition results were counted \"(not counting points in brackets)\" for IFSC Climbing World Cup 2017.\nNational Teams.\nFor National Team Ranking, 3 best results per competition and category were counted \"(not counting results in brackets)\".\n\"Country names as used by the IFSC\"\nLead.\nAn overall ranking was determined based upon points, which athletes were awarded for finishing in the top 30 of each individual event.\nMen.\n7 best competition results were counted (\"not counting points in brackets\") for IFSC Climbing Worldcup 2017.

Since 2008, the team has played an annual fixture against the Queensland Under-16s team as a curtain-raiser to a State of Origin game. The team features players selected from New South Wales's premier under-16 rugby league competition, the Harold Matthews Cup and Andrew Johns Cup. They New South Wales Rugby League administered them.\nHistory.\nPrior to 2008, junior interstate matches were contested at under-17 and under-19 levels. In 2008, with the advent of the National Youth Competition, the age levels switched to an under-16 and under-18 format to keep in line with the NSWRL's existing S.G. Ball Cup and Harold Matthews Cup competitions and the QRL's Mal Meninga Cup and Cyril Connell Cup competitions, which would begin in 2009.\nNew South Wales saw success in the first under-16 Origin fixture in 2008. They recorded their first defeat a year later, losing 30-10 in 2009 at Etihad Stadium. From 2010 to 2013, New South Wales would win four games consecutively before losing both fixtures against Queensland in 2014 and 2015. Since 2015, New South Wales has won every under-16 Origin fixture in 2016, 2017 and 2018.\nPlayers.\nPlayers selected for the New South Wales under-16 team are usually contracted with a National Rugby League (NRL) side and, until 2017, played in the Harold Matthews Cup. Occasionally players, who are contracted to Queensland-based NRL sides who play in the Cyril Connell Cup, are selected. Each pre-season, the New South Wales Rugby League will select an under-16 squad featuring players in contention for the mid-season fixture."

        "text": "Edward Hill (born 26 March 1999) is an English professional rugby union player who plays as a Flanker for Bath.\nRugby career.\nClub.\nHill started playing rugby as a child at Malvern RFC prior to joining the Worcester Warriors academy. In November 2017 he made his club debut against Sale Sharks in the Anglo-Welsh Cup. He made his league debut at the start of the 2018–19 Premiership season coming off the bench to score two tries including the winner against Leicester Tigers at Welford Road. On 3 November 2018, an article on BBC Sport's website, illustrated the meteoric rise of Hill, mentioning \"(Hill's) four tries in his last five appearances for Worcester\".\nIn June 2020 Hill signed a contract extension which would see him remain at Worcester until 2024 and the following month he was confirmed as club captain.\nIn October 2022, Hill had his contracted terminated by the club, alongside the rest of his teammates after WRFC Players Limited, the company that owns Worcester Warriors RFC, were liquidated following a winding up petition. When speaking on the matter, Hill was quoted as saying, \"There will be nothing written for the people who put us in this situation but to the governing bodies of rugby, something needs to change so that this doesn’t happen to any club again.\"\nAfter joining Bath on loan only days before his Worcester contract was terminated it was later announced he had joined the club on a permanent basis.\nInternational.\nHill represented England under-16 and in March 2017 scored a try for the England under-18 side against France. He made his debut for the England under-20 team against Italy during the 2017 Six Nations Under 20s Championship and the following year started in the final of the 2018 World Rugby Under 20 Championship as England finished runners up to hosts France. He was also a member of the squad that finished fifth at the 2019 World Rugby Under 20 Championship and during the tournament scored two tries in a pool game against Australia.\nIn October 2018 Hill received his first call-up by coach Eddie Jones to the senior squad for a training camp prior to the autumn internationals. On 17 November 2018 he made his Test debut as a 75th minute substitute in the victory over Japan."

He played college baseball for Central Connecticut State University, and was in New Zealand preparing to play in Australia at the time of his death.\nCareer.\nCostello attended Wethersfield High School in Wethersfield, Connecticut. Undrafted out of high school in the 2014 MLB draft, he enrolled at Central Connecticut State University, where he played college baseball. As a freshman in 2015, he appeared in 37 games (with 34 being starts), batting .248 with two home runs and 13 RBIs. Following his first collegiate baseball season, he played for the Bristol Blues during the summer. In 2016, as a sophomore, he was batting .324 with three home runs and 21 RBIs in thirty games before an injury ended his season. He returned from the injury that summer and played for the Keene Swamp Bats where he hit .264 with five home runs and 19 RBIs in 42 games. As a junior in 2017, he batted .296 with nine home runs and 52 RBIs in 58 games. \nAfter his junior year, he was selected by the Seattle Mariners in the 31st round of the 2017 MLB draft. He signed for $5,000 and made his professional debut that year for the Arizona League Mariners, batting .331/.430/.634 with eight home runs and 38 RBIs in 44 games. He began 2018 with the Clinton LumberKings, with whom he was named to the Midwest League All-Star Game where he participated in the Home Run Derby.\nOn July 30, 2018, Costello (along with Chase De Jong) was traded to the Minnesota Twins in exchange for Zach Duke. He was assigned to their minor league affiliate, Fort Myers Miracle, and finished the season there. In 128 games between Clinton and Fort Myers, he hit .258 with twenty home runs and 79 RBIs. He returned to Fort Myers to begin 2019, and was promoted to the Twins' Double-A affiliate Pensacola Blue Wahoos during the season. Over 108 games with the two clubs, Costello batted .223/.343./412 with 15 home runs and 46 RBIs.\nDeath.\nCostello died on November 18, 2019, in Auckland, New Zealand, while preparing to start the Australian Baseball League season with the Auckland Tuatara. He was 23 years old. Costello was found dead in his hotel room bed by teammates. An autopsy revealed that he died of sudden cardiac arrhythmia. In February 2022, his parents filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the physician who conducted Costello's preseason physical, alleging that he intentionally ignored ECG results showing that Costello had Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome which likely caused the sudden cardiac arrhythmia that led to his death."

        "text": "Leinster versus Ulster is the oldest fixture in Irish rugby, with the first ever interprovincial match taking place between the sides in 1875. As such, a healthy rivalry has developed between the two provincial rivals.\nBoth provinces combined to provide the squad for the Irish international representative side from the first international match in 1875 until the IRFU was formally founded in 1879, consisting of the formal founding of the Leinster and Ulster branches and the addition of a third provincial side, the Munster branch. Finally a Connacht branch was added in 1885 to complete representation for all four provinces of Ireland.\nThe Interprovincial Championship did not formally begin until the 1946–47 season. Since then, Leinster and Ulster have played in many high profile games, including League and European Cup finals, with Leinster getting the upper hand on the big occasions thus far.\nStatistics.\nBiggest wins\nLeinster: 40–7 (33 points, 5 January 2019), 38–7 (31 points, 2017/18), 9–39 (30 points, 1980/81)\nUlster: 30–6 (24 points, 2015/16), 28-6 (22 points, 2003/04), 14–34 (10 points, 1998/99)\nHighest scoring match\nLeinster 54 - Ulster 42 (96 points, 20 December 2019)\nLowest scoring match\nLeinster 0 - Ulster 0 (0 points, 1947/48)\nMost consecutive wins\nLeinster: 9 (1975/76 - 1983/84), 7 (2009/10 - 2011/12), 6 (2019/2020 - 2021/2022)\nUlster: 9 (1984/85 - 1992/93), 5 (1966/67 - 1970/71), 3 (1955/56 - 1957/58)\nHighest attendance\n81,774 (European Cup Final, Twickenham Stadium, May 2012)"

        "text": "James M. Cross (January 29, 1933 – May 2, 2020) was an American ice hockey player and coach who led the Vermont Catamounts of the University of Vermont for nineteen seasons.\nPlaying career.\nCross graduated from Boston University in 1960, having played ice hockey for the Terriers for two seasons. In his senior year, he helped the team record a third-place finish at the 1960 NCAA men's ice hockey tournament. While at BU, Cross played collegiate summer baseball with the Dennis Clippers of the Cape Cod Baseball League.\nCoaching career.\nAfter graduating from BU, Cross became the director of physical education at Lyman C. Hunt School, a position he held for four years before accepting the head coaching position at nearby Vermont. Cross joined the program in only its third year of existence and took a few years to get the team going in the right direction. In 1970 Cross won his first ECAC 2 tournament title but did not participate in the national tournament because the Division II championship did not start until 1978. After two more good seasons Cross's teams won back-to-back ECAC II titles, and went undefeated in conference play in 1973, earning Cross the Edward Jeremiah Award that year.\nIn 1974 Vermont promoted its program to Division I and was immediately accepted into ECAC Hockey. The Catamounts exceeded general expectation by finishing the season with a 24–12 record and in third place in the conference. The team also finished third in the ECAC tournament. After this promising start, Vermont declined to middling records for four years before winning an ECAC West divisional title in 1980. The 1979–80 season was Cross's last winning season, and over his final four years Vermont finished no higher than 12th in the conference. In 1984 Cross resigned, saying, \"I want to step aside before I get to the burnout stage.\"\nCross remained with the University of Vermont until his retirement in 1994 and two years later was inducted into the University of Vermont Athletic Hall of Fame. He was honored in 2001 with the American Hockey Coaches Association's John MacInnes Award, which \"recognizes those people who have shown a great concern for amateur hockey and youth programs.\" In 2019, Cross received the prestigious Hobey Baker Legends of College Hockey Award, and in 2020, he was inducted into the Vermont Sports Hall of Fame.\nLater life and death.\nIn his later years, Cross lived in Savannah, Georgia, and died there of complications from COVID-19 on May 2, 2020, at age 87, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Georgia (U.S. state)."

The game was released on 17 April 2019 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with the Nintendo Switch version coming out on 23 August 2019. All 128 players from the World Snooker Tour appear in the game, as do venues from all 26 tournaments, including Alexandra Palace and the Crucible Theatre.\nGameplay.\n\"Snooker 19\" includes all officially licensed tournaments from the 2018–19 snooker season. It features single-player, multiplayer and online multiplayer modes.\nThe game featured full likenesses for all tour players, and the Q School qualification events for the main tour. Matches include in-game commentary by Neal Foulds, and David Hendon, as well as refereeing by Brendan Moore. Multiplayer matches mirror real-life tournaments, with in-game tournaments co-existing with events, though all events are played under a \"single table\" set up.\nRelease.\nPrior to the release of \"Snooker 19\", Joanne Williams (wife of 2018 world champion Mark Williams) accused the game of \"massive prejudice\" as the game's cover art did not feature Williams. Williams commented that the decision was due to him being over 40 years old and Welsh. This led to fans imposing pictures of a naked Williams over the cover art for the release.\n\"Snooker 19\" was released on 17 April 2019 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The Nintendo Switch version came out on 23 August 2019.\nIn April 2020, a \"Virtual Snooker World Championship\" took place, contested by the top 16 players on the PS4 version of the game. The matches were released on the official World Snooker Tour YouTube channel, with each player representing a real-life pro in the tournament.\nA mobile port was released in August 2020 under the title \"WST Snooker\"."

        "text": "Barry Mitchell (born April 28, 1965) is an American former professional basketball player.\nCollege career.\nMitchell attended First Colonial High School in his hometown of Virginia Beach, Virginia. During his time there he was a standout athlete in basketball and earned All-State honors. He then enrolled at Norfolk State where he studied physical education.\nAt the time, Norfolk State was playing in the NCAA Division II and competed in the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association. In his 4-year career Mitchell played 119 games, totalling 1,631 points (13.7 average), 928 rebounds (7.8), 502 assists (4.2) and 235 steals (2.0). He recorded 2 triple-doubles in his career, both in the month of February 1987: he had 21 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists versus Johnson C. Smith on February 27, and 30 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists versus Shaw on February 4.\nHe led the team in rebounds for 3 consecutive seasons from 1984 to 1987, in assists in 1985–86 (4.9 average) and 1986–87 (5.1), and was the steals leader in 1986–87. Mitchell was named in the All-CIAA Team for three consecutive seasons from 1985 to 1987.\nProfessional career.\nAfter his 4-year college career, Mitchell was automatically eligible for the 1987 NBA draft, but he was not selected by an NBA franchise and decided to sign for the Wyoming Wildcatters of the Continental Basketball Association. During his first professional season he appeared in 52 games, averaging 8.4 points, 5.0 rebounds, 2.2 assists and 1.3 steals in regular season play. His team qualified for the playoffs and reached the CBA finals, where they were defeated by the Albany Patroons in 7 games: Mitchell averaged 12.3 points, 7.0 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 2.5 steals in 19 games played during the postseason. Mitchell then decided to join the Youngstown Pride, a team which competed in the World Basketball League, a league that only accepted players 6 ft 5 in tall and under. In three years he experienced significant success, winning the championship in 1989 and 1990 and being named the league's MVP twice. He was also named in the All-Defensive team three times from 1988 to 1990.\nHe returned to the CBA in January 1991, joining the Quad City Thunder where he played the last 14 games of the regular season and 17 games in the playoffs, where his team lost in the finals to the Wichita Falls Texans. He averaged 8.0 points, 6.0 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.5 steals in the regular season, and 13.1 points, 10.7 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 2.9 steals in postseason play.\nThe 1991–92 CBA season was the best of Mitchell's career. He started 52 of the 55 regular season games he played, and averaged 20.1 points, 8.6 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 2.9 steals, leading the CBA in steals. Mitchell showed again his defensive prowess, and significantly improved his scoring average to 20.1 points per game. He led his team in scoring and rebounding and was named the league's Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year, the first time in CBA history in which both awards went to the same player. He started all of his 9 playoffs games, and he averaged 19.7 points, 9.3 rebounds, 6.0 assists and 2.6 steals.\nHe played two more seasons with the Thunder: the signing of Derek Strong in the 1992–93 season made him the second scoring option, and he averaged 16.7 points, 5.7 rebounds, 5.6 assists and 2.1 steals in 27 games. He did not appear in any of the postseason games. The 1993–94 season was Mitchell's last with the team, and he came from the bench more often, starting only 24 of his 43 games. He averaged 13.0 points, 5.8 rebounds, 4.7 assists and 2.3 steals; he regained his starting role during the playoffs, and in 13 games (all starts) he averaged 16.2 points, 6.5 rebounds, 4.2 assists and 1.7 steals. He led the Thunder to their first CBA Championship, in five games over the Omaha Racers\nMitchell was one of Quad City Thunder's most successful players and holds several distinctions with the team: he is the all-time leader in steals with 338, and he ranks 2nd in points (2,226), 2nd in minutes played (5,203), 3rd in number of games played (139), 3rd in rebounds (962) and 4th in assists (668).\nIn 1994 he decided to transfer to Europe and signed with Belgian team Sunair Ostende. He spent several seasons with the club, playing his last game in 1999. During his tenure at Oostende he won the Belgian league once in 1995 and Belgian cup twice in 1997 and 1998.\nHe then played for Siemens Gent in the 1999–2000 season, and of Liège in the 2001–02 season. He moved to French team Nantes in 2002, playing 15 games with averaged of 6.3 points, 5.9 rebounds 2.8 assists and 1.1 steals.\nIn 2013–14 he played for B.C. Alleur, in the Belgian lower leagues."

        "text": "The 2019 Survivor Series was the 33rd annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw, SmackDown, and NXT brand divisions. The event took place on November 24, 2019, at the Allstate Arena in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont, Illinois, marking the second Survivor Series held here after the 1989 event when the arena was still known as the Rosemont Horizon (renamed in 1999). It was the first and only Survivor Series to include the NXT brand (along with NXT's sister brand NXT UK, which was grouped with NXT), the first since 2009 to feature three major brands, and the first and only to feature three-way Survivor Series elimination matches. The theme of the event was brand supremacy and featured wrestlers from the three brands against each other.\nTen matches were contested at the event, including three on the Kickoff pre-show. The card was highlighted by two Survivor Series elimination matches: Team NXT won the women's match in the opening bout, while Team SmackDown won the men's match. In the main event, NXT Women's Champion Shayna Baszler defeated Raw Women's Champion Becky Lynch and SmackDown Women's Champion Bayley in a non-title triple threat match. NXT won brand supremacy by winning four of the seven interbrand matches; SmackDown won two while Raw's sole win was on the pre-show. In what were the only non-interbrand matches on the card, all three of WWE's world championships at the time were defended: Brock Lesnar retained Raw's WWE Championship against Rey Mysterio in a No Holds Barred match, \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt retained SmackDown's Universal Championship against Daniel Bryan, and Adam Cole retained the NXT Championship against Pete Dunne.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual professional wrestling event produced every November by WWE since 1987, generally held the week of Thanksgiving. The second longest running pay-per-view (PPV) event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, referred to as the \"Big Four\". The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. Announced on November 19, 2018, the 33rd Survivor Series was scheduled to be held on November 24, 2019, at the Allstate Arena in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont, Illinois, marking the second Survivor Series held here after the 1989 event when the arena was still known as the Rosemont Horizon (renamed in 1999). In addition to airing on PPV worldwide, the event was available to livestream on the WWE Network.\nFollowing the reintroduction of the brand split in July 2016, Survivor Series became centered around competition between wrestlers from Raw and SmackDown for brand supremacy. In addition to traditional Survivor Series matches between the brands, the champions of Raw faced their SmackDown counterparts in non-title matches, which began at the 2017 event. In September 2019, NXT, previously WWE's developmental brand, debuted on the USA Network, solidifying its status as WWE's third major brand, and was subsequently added to the 2019 event as part of the brand competition theme (wrestlers from NXT UK also appeared and were grouped under the NXT umbrella). It was in turn the first Survivor Series to include NXT and the first since the 2009 event to feature a third major brand. Due to NXT's addition, it was the first Survivor Series to have three-way Survivor Series elimination matches.\nWith the exception of the men's top champions—as each brand's top championship was defended at the event—the 2019 Survivor Series featured the Raw, SmackDown, and NXT Women's Champions facing off, Raw's United States Champion, SmackDown's Intercontinental Champion, and NXT's North American Champion going against each other, and the Raw, SmackDown, and NXT Tag Team Champions in a triple threat tag team match. As the NXT Cruiserweight Championship was the only title of its kind in WWE, it was defended in a triple threat match against challengers of the opposing brands. During a media call for , WWE Chief Operating Officer and NXT head Triple H said that there were talks of doing a triple threat match between Raw's WWE Champion, SmackDown's Universal Champion, and the NXT Champion, but because of the storyline between WWE Champion Brock Lesnar and Rey Mysterio, they felt that their match needed to happen at this event. He also said that Universal Champion \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt worked better in his own storyline.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised 10 matches, including three on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw, SmackDown, and NXT brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\", \"Friday Night SmackDown\", and Wednesday night's \"NXT\".\nWorld championship matches.\nOn the September 30 episode of \"Raw\", Brock Lesnar brutally attacked Rey Mysterio as well as Mysterio's son, Dominik, who was seated in the front row. After Lesnar won the WWE Championship during \"SmackDown's 20th Anniversary\", an injured Mysterio appeared along with Dominic's godfather and Lesnar's former Ultimate Fighting Championship rival, Cain Velasquez, who attacked Lesnar. At Crown Jewel, Lesnar retained the championship against Velasquez by submission and continued to apply the Kimura Lock after the match had concluded until Mysterio attacked Lesnar with a chair. Lesnar fended off Mysterio, who retaliated by striking Lesnar with multiple chair shots, forcing him to retreat. On the following \"SmackDown\", Lesnar quit SmackDown to move to Raw (with the WWE Championship) in order to seek revenge against Mysterio, who had been drafted to Raw. On the following \"Raw\", Lesnar proceeded to attack crew members in search of Mysterio, including commentator Dio Maddin, whom he put through the broadcast table with an F-5. Mysterio then appeared, struck Lesnar with a steel pipe, and later challenged Lesnar for the WWE Championship at Survivor Series, which was made official. On the November 18 episode of \"Raw\", Lesnar's advocate Paul Heyman suggested a No Holds Barred match and Mysterio accepted.\nAt Crown Jewel, SmackDown wrestler \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt won Raw's Universal Championship, thus transferring the title to SmackDown. Backstage during the November 8 episode of \"SmackDown\", as Sami Zayn was trying to convince Daniel Bryan to join his faction, \"The Fiend\" appeared and attacked Bryan with the Mandible Claw. During a \"Miz TV\" segment the following week, Wyatt (as his normal self) taunted Bryan by mocking the latter's former \"Yes Movement\" persona. In response, Bryan challenged Wyatt for the Universal Championship at Survivor Series and Wyatt accepted, but with Bryan facing Wyatt's alter-ego \"The Fiend\".\nOn November 19, Adam Cole was scheduled to defend the NXT Championship at Survivor Series. His opponent was determined by a triple threat match that occurred at TakeOver: WarGames the night before Survivor Series, where Pete Dunne defeated Damian Priest and Killian Dain to earn the title shot. This marked the first time that an NXT championship was to be defended on the main card of a Survivor Series event.\nChampions brand supremacy matches.\nOn the November 1 episode of \"SmackDown\", after Bayley defeated Nikki Cross to retain the SmackDown Women's Championship due to interference from Sasha Banks, NXT Women's Champion Shayna Baszler appeared and attacked all three. During a sit-down interview on the following \"Raw\", Charly Caruso informed Raw Women's Champion Becky Lynch that she would be facing Baszler and Bayley in a non-title triple threat match at Survivor Series, after which, Baszler appeared and confronted Lynch. Over the following weeks, the three would invade each others shows, attacking one another.\nPrior to the November 6 episode of \"NXT\", Raw's The O.C. (AJ Styles, Luke Gallows, and Karl Anderson) invaded NXT and attacked The Undisputed Era (Adam Cole, Bobby Fish, Kyle O'Reilly, and Roderick Strong). On the November 11 episode of \"Raw\", a non-title triple threat match between United States Champion AJ Styles, Intercontinental Champion Shinsuke Nakamura, and North American Champion Roderick Strong was scheduled for Survivor Series. Following a tag team match on the November 22 episode of \"SmackDown\", the three brawled with each other.\nOn the November 4 episode of \"Raw\", a non-title triple threat tag team match between Raw Tag Team Champions The Viking Raiders (Erik and Ivar), SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Revival (Scott Dawson and Dash Wilder), and NXT Tag Team Champions The Undisputed Era (Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly) was scheduled for Survivor Series. However, on the November 8 episode of \"SmackDown\", The New Day's Big E and Kofi Kingston defeated The Revival to win the SmackDown Tag Team Championship, thus replacing them in the match. During a rematch the following week, The Undisputed Era invaded SmackDown and interfered, costing The Revival the match.\nSurvivor Series elimination matches.\nOn the November 8 episode of \"SmackDown\", Michael Cole announced Sasha Banks as the captain for Team SmackDown's women's team. Later that night, Carmella and Dana Brooke defeated Fire &amp; Desire (Mandy Rose and Sonya Deville) to qualify for the team after the match had been rescheduled due to a backstage attack from NXT's Bianca Belair the previous week that led to Rhea Ripley and Tegan Nox defeating Fire &amp; Desire. On November 14, WWE.com announced Lacey Evans as the fourth member of Team SmackDown, followed by Nikki Cross on November 17 after Cross, who was originally scheduled to face Bayley in a non-title qualifying match, scored the pin in an eight-woman tag team match on the November 15 episode of \"SmackDown\". On the November 18 episode of \"Raw\", Charlotte Flair was announced as the captain for Team Raw, with Natalya, Sarah Logan, and WWE Women's Tag Team Champions The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka and Kairi Sane) revealed as the other team members later that night. Following a tag team match that night in which Flair and Becky Lynch faced The IIconics (Billie Kay and Peyton Royce), the latter being disgruntled as they were not selected for Team Raw, NXT's Shayna Baszler, Marina Shafir, and Jessamyn Duke attacked the women. On the November 22 episode of \"SmackDown\", Rhea Ripley was revealed as the captain for Team NXT. Later that night, Ripley defeated Flair and Banks in a triple threat match, and a brawl occurred with all the women from the three brands following the match. After the conclusion of TakeOver: WarGames, Ripley picked Candice LeRae, Bianca Belair, Io Shirai, and Toni Storm (from NXT UK) as the other members of Team NXT.\nOn November 8, WWE.com announced that Seth Rollins was selected as the captain for Team Raw's men's team, with Kevin Owens, Ricochet, Randy Orton, and Drew McIntyre revealed as the other team members during the November 11 episode of \"Raw\". On the November 12 episode of \"WWE Backstage\", Roman Reigns was revealed as the captain for Team SmackDown, with Mustafa Ali (formerly known as Ali), Braun Strowman, King Corbin, and Shorty G also announced for the team. NXT head Triple H tried to convince Rollins as well as Owens to leave Raw and come back to NXT where they had started their WWE careers. Both turned down the offers, leading to the NXT roster attacking members of Raw, as well as those on SmackDown. At the conclusion of the November 18 \"Raw\", Triple H invited members of Raw and SmackDown to the following episode of \"NXT\", where a large brawl broke out between all three brands. All the members of Raw, SmackDown, and NXT would brawl again following the conclusion of a six-man tag team match on the November 22 episode of \"SmackDown\". Triple H, Shawn Michaels, and Road Dogg led the NXT roster in the invasion of SmackDown, reenacting how D-Generation X had attempted to invade World Championship Wrestling's \"Monday Nitro\" in 1998 with a tank. After the conclusion of TakeOver: WarGames, Triple H announced that Shawn Michaels would reveal the members of Team NXT during the Survivor Series Kickoff pre-show.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nThree matches occurred during the two-hour Survivor Series Kickoff pre-show, two of which were announced during the pre-show. In the first match, Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode from SmackDown won an interbrand 10-man battle royal featuring tag teams from the three brands, lastly eliminating The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) from Raw, giving SmackDown the first point of the night.\nIn the second pre-show match, NXT's Lio Rush defended the NXT Cruiserweight Championship in an interbrand triple threat match against Raw's Akira Tozawa and SmackDown's Kalisto. In the end, Rush performed a Final Hour on Kalisto to retain the title, giving NXT their first point.\nThe last match of the pre-show was the non-title triple threat match between the brands' tag team champions, Raw Tag Team Champions The Viking Raiders (Erik and Ivar), SmackDown Tag Team Champions The New Day (Big E and Kofi Kingston), and NXT Tag Team Champions The Undisputed Era (Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly). The climax saw The Viking Raiders perform The Viking Experience on O'Reilly onto Fish and pin Fish, tying the brands at 1 point each.\nAlso during the Kickoff pre-show, Shawn Michaels revealed Tommaso Ciampa (as captain), Damian Priest, Keith Lee, Matt Riddle, and WWE United Kingdom Champion Walter (from NXT UK) as the members of Team NXT for the men's three-way Survivor Series elimination match.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with the women's three-way Survivor Series elimination match, featuring Team Raw (Charlotte Flair, Natalya, Sarah Logan, and WWE Women's Tag Team Champions Asuka and Kairi Sane) against Team SmackDown (Sasha Banks, Carmella, Dana Brooke, Lacey Evans, and Nikki Cross) against Team NXT (Rhea Ripley, Bianca Belair, Candice LeRae, Io Shirai, and Toni Storm). After a brawl, Shirai and LeRae were taken to the back for apparently sustaining injuries. The first elimination occurred when Belair trapped Cross in a roll up after Ripley had distracted the latter. Logan was next eliminated by Belair, who performed a 450 Splash on Logan. The next two women eliminated were Carmella who was pinned by a natural selection from Charlotte, shortly followed by Kairi Sane who was eliminated by a Meteora from Banks. Asuka eliminated Brooke after a kick. Flair and Asuka subsequently got into an altercation resulting in Asuka spitting green mist in Flair's face, who was then blinded and was eliminated by Evans after performing a Women's Right; Asuka also walked out of the match during this time, resulting in her elimination by forfeit. Evans was pinned by Natalya with a schoolboy, who then applied a dual submission alongside Banks to eliminate Storm. Belair was then eliminated by Banks after an assisted spinebuster/clothesline combo. Banks also took out Natalya with a punch, following a brief alliance against Ripley. Shirai and LeRae then returned, having feigned their injuries, and aided Ripley, who performed a Riptide on Banks to win the match for Team NXT, bringing NXT's score to 2 points with Raw and SmackDown at 1 point each.\nBackstage, Team Raw's men's captain Seth Rollins questioned Kevin Owens' loyalty as Owens had appeared at NXT TakeOver: WarGames the previous night as the mystery partner for Tommaso Ciampa's team in the men's WarGames match. Owens assured Rollins that his loyalty was with Raw and that he had only participated in that match to get revenge on The Undisputed Era for attacking him on the previous episode of \"Raw\". Owens then questioned Rollins' own loyalty, bringing up how Rollins had turned on his teammates in The Shield back in 2014.\nNext was the non-title triple threat match between the brands' secondary champions, Raw's United States Champion AJ Styles, SmackDown's Intercontinental Champion Shinsuke Nakamura (accompanied by Sami Zayn), and NXT North American Champion Roderick Strong. In the closing moments, as Styles performed a Phenomenal Forearm on Nakamura, Strong threw Styles out of the ring and pinned Nakamura to win the match, bringing NXT's score to 3 points.\nAfter that was the first of the three non-interbrand championship matches in which Adam Cole defended the NXT Championship against Pete Dunne. In the climax, Cole performed a Last Shot to the back of Dunne's head to retain the title.\nThe fourth match was SmackDown's world championship match where \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt defended the Universal Championship against Daniel Bryan. Bryan performed a Running Knee on The Fiend for a near-fall. Bryan performed Yes Kicks and three consecutive missile dropkicks on The Fiend. As Bryan went back to the top rope, The Fiend caught Bryan with the Mandible Claw submission, causing Bryan to pass out with The Fiend getting the pinfall victory to retain the title.\nNext was the men's three-way Survivor Series elimination match, featuring Team Raw (Seth Rollins, Drew McIntyre, Kevin Owens, Randy Orton, and Ricochet) against Team SmackDown (Roman Reigns, Braun Strowman, King Corbin, Mustafa Ali, and Shorty G) against Team NXT (Tommaso Ciampa, Damian Priest, Matt Riddle, Keith Lee, and WWE United Kingdom Champion Walter). McIntyre performed a Claymore Kick on Walter to eliminate him. Shorty G was then pinned by Owens after a frog splash. Ciampa performed a Spike DDT on Owens to eliminate him. Orton performed an RKO on Priest to eliminate him, before Riddle rolled up Orton to eliminate him. Riddle himself was then eliminated by Corbin after Orton performed an RKO on Riddle in anger. After a brawl outside the ring, Strowman was eliminated by countout. Corbin then performed End of Days on Ricochet to eliminate him. Ali was eliminated after a Stomp by Rollins. McIntyre was the next eliminated after a Spear from Reigns. Corbin was then eliminated after he received a Spear from teammate Reigns, and Ciampa pinned Corbin. Rollins and Reigns briefly teamed up and attempted to perform The Shield's signature powerbomb on Ciampa through an announce table, only for Lee to save Ciampa. Back in the ring, Rollins performed The Stomp on Ciampa to eliminate him followed by Lee eliminating Rollins with a fireman’s carry jackhammer. Lee performed the Spirit Bomb on Reigns for a near-fall. As Lee then attempted a moonsault, Reigns avoided Lee and performed a Spear to win the match as the sole survivor for Team SmackDown, bringing SmackDown's score to 2 points with NXT at 3 points and Raw at 1 point. Following the match, Reigns showed respect to Lee by offering him a fist bump which Lee accepted.\nThe penultimate match was for Raw's world championship, where Brock Lesnar (accompanied by Paul Heyman) defended the WWE Championship against Rey Mysterio in a No Holds Barred match. Despite Mysterio quickly exiting the ring at the start of the match to obtain a steel pipe, Lesnar stopped Mysterio from using it and dominated him. Mysterio's son Dominik ran to the ring with a towel in hand, pleading with Lesnar to stop the onslaught. As Lesnar was distracted, Mysterio attacked Lesnar with a low blow, followed by one from Dominik. The father and son then attacked Lesnar with a steel pipe and steel chair, respectively, and then performed double 619's and dual Frog Splashes on Lesnar for a near-fall. As they attempted additional Frog Splashes, Lesnar quickly grabbed Dominik and performed a German suplex on him. Lesnar then caught Mysterio in midair and performed an F-5 to retain the title.\nMain event.\nThe main event was the non-title triple threat match between the brands' women's champions, Raw Women's Champion Becky Lynch, SmackDown Women's Champion Bayley, and NXT Women's Champion Shayna Baszler. In the climax, as Lynch was down outside the ring, Bayley attempted a Diving Elbow Drop on Baszler, who caught her in the Kirifuda Clutch, forcing Bayley to submit to win the match. Baszler's win gave NXT the final point of the night to win brand supremacy at 4 points, where SmackDown had 2 points and Raw only had 1. Following the match, Lynch attacked Baszler and put her through the announce table.\nAftermath.\nRaw.\nDuring the opening of the following night's \"Raw\", Team Raw's men's captain Seth Rollins addressed the Raw locker room, who surrounded the ring, and criticized their poor performance at Survivor Series. In particular, Rollins singled out the performances of women's captain Charlotte Flair, Randy Orton, and Rey Mysterio (for not winning the WWE Championship as Brock Lesnar rarely appears), as well as AOP (Akam and Rezar) for not participating at all. Turning heel for the first time since 2016 and alienated by the comments, each wrestler gradually walked out. Rollins then addressed Kevin Owens, the last remaining wrestler at the ring. He again questioned Owens' loyalty to Raw, and accused Owens of lazily trying to be like himself. In response, Owens performed a stunner on Rollins and later challenged him to a match. During the match, AOP entered the ring. Owens slapped Akam, resulting in AOP attacking Owens, giving him a disqualification win. AOP then turned their attention to Rollins, who was ready to fight, but they instead left the ring. Rollins then performed two Stomps on Owens, teasing a heel turn for Rollins. The heel turn was finally executed on the December 9 episode, where Rollins performed \"The Stomp\" on Owens on the exposed concrete and aligned himself with AOP. After more months of feuding, Owens accepted Rollins' challenge for a match at WrestleMania 36.\nWWE Champion Brock Lesnar and Paul Heyman made their first appearance since Survivor Series on the January 6, 2020, episode of \"Raw\". There, Heyman announced that Lesnar would be entering the men's Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble as the number one entrant.\nAlso on \"Raw\", a United States Championship match between AJ Styles and Humberto Carrillo was initially scheduled, only for Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson to attack Carrillo from behind during his entrance, rendering him unable to compete. Ricochet, Drew McIntyre, Randy Orton, and Rey Mysterio then requested a title match. A fatal four-way match was contested to determine who would challenge Styles for the title that night. Mysterio won the fatal four-way match and subsequently defeated Styles to win the United States Championship for a second time, with help from Orton.\nDue to the events that occurred between Charlotte Flair and Asuka during the women's Survivor Series match, a match between the two was scheduled on the following night's \"Raw\", where Asuka pinned Flair after an assist from her tag team partner Kairi Sane and again spitting green mist in Flair's face. Flair would then lose to The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka and Sane) the following week. On the December 9 episode, Flair approached her former rival and Raw Women's Champion Becky Lynch, who defeated The Kabuki Warriors via disqualification, after which, they put Lynch through a table. Later that night, Lynch and Flair accepted The Kabuki Warriors' challenge for a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match for the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship at .\nSmackDown.\nTeam SmackDown's men's captain Roman Reigns opened the following \"SmackDown\". Reigns thanked his SmackDown team, except King Corbin, whom he called out. Corbin claimed it was because of him that SmackDown won, and stated that Reigns betrayed his team when Reigns caused his elimination by attacking him. Reigns challenged Corbin to a match, however, Corbin instead brought out Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode and Roode challenged Reigns instead, in which Reigns won. Following the match, a brawl ensued. This led to a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match between Reigns and Corbin for TLC.\nAlso on the following \"SmackDown\", Universal Champion \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt challenged Daniel Bryan, who was now embracing the Yes Movement again, to another match which Bryan accepted. The Fiend then attacked Bryan, ripping out his hair. He also debuted a new custom championship belt. The Miz was then intertwined in the feud, and at TLC, Wyatt, as his normal Firefly Fun House self, defeated Miz. After the match, a hooded figure attacked Wyatt and revealed himself as Bryan, with a buzz cut and a shorter beard. On the December 27 episode of \"SmackDown\", Bryan won a triple threat match by submitting Miz to earn a rematch against The Fiend for the Universal Championship at the Royal Rumble, which was stipulated as a strap match.\nSmackDown Women's Champion Bayley and Team SmackDown women's captain Sasha Banks stated they did not lose at Survivor Series because NXT was better, but because the rest of SmackDown let them down. Banks and Bayley criticized each member of Team SmackDown with Lacey Evans being last, who came out to confront them and delivered a Women's Right to Banks. After more weeks of feuding, Bayley was scheduled to defend the SmackDown Women's Championship against Evans at the Royal Rumble.\nNXT.\nOn the following \"NXT\", the entire roster (including NXT UK) celebrated their brand's victory over Raw and SmackDown at Survivor Series only for The Undisputed Era to interrupt. Adam Cole stated that the only reason NXT won was due to their stable. Tommaso Ciampa reminded Cole that it was his team that defeated The Undisputed Era at WarGames and warned them that their days of holding their respective championships were numbered, with Ciampa focusing on Cole's NXT Championship. Finn Bálor then interrupted. In response, Ciampa issued a challenge to Bálor, which the latter agreed, and Bálor defeated Ciampa due to interference from Cole. Following the match, Bálor performed a Pele Kick on Cole. Bálor then defeated Ciampa and Keith Lee in a triple threat match to become the number one contender for Cole's NXT Championship.\nAlso on the following \"NXT\", Rhea Ripley had a face-to-face confrontation with NXT Women's Champion Shayna Baszler, and congratulated her for defeating Raw Women's Champion Becky Lynch and SmackDown Women's Champion Bayley at Survivor Series. Ripley then reminded Baszler that her team defeated Baszler's team at WarGames and then issued a challenge to Baszler for her championship. The title match was then scheduled for the December 18 episode, where Ripley was victorious, ending Baszler's reign at 416 days.\nAlso on the following \"NXT\", Lio Rush defeated Raw's Akira Tozawa to retain the NXT Cruiserweight Championship.\nAfter Shayna Baszler lost the NXT Women's Championship, she reignited her feud with Raw Women's Champion Becky Lynch in 2020. At the Royal Rumble, Baszler entered as the final entrant in the women's Royal Rumble match and finished as the runner-up. After Lynch's successful title defense on the February 10 episode of \"Raw\", Baszler viciously attacked Lynch. She then single-handedly eliminated all of the other opponents in the women's Elimination Chamber match at Elimination Chamber to earn a title match against Lynch at WrestleMania 36.\nAlthough NXT had won the brand competition for the 2019 Survivor Series, the brand was removed from the competition at the 2020 event. NXT was removed due to COVID-19-related issues, as outbreaks of the virus had occurred at both of NXT's home arenas, Full Sail University and then the WWE Performance Center, prompting WWE to exclude NXT wrestlers from the event to avoid potential transmission of the virus to members of the Raw and SmackDown rosters. In September 2021, NXT was restructured as NXT 2.0 and reverted to its developmental roots.\nResults.\nSurvivor Series elimination matches.\nTeam"

The winners of the Division Series would move on to the League Championship Series to determine the pennant winners that face each other in the World Series.\nIn the American League, the Boston Red Sox and Cleveland Indians made their third straight appearances, the Houston Astros and New York Yankees made their second straight appearances, and the Oakland Athletics made their fourth appearance in the past seven years. This postseason was notable for being the first in which the American League had three teams that won at least 100 games or more in the regular season.\nIn the National League, the Los Angeles Dodgers made their sixth straight postseason appearance, the Colorado Rockies made their second straight appearance, the Chicago Cubs made their fourth straight appearance, the Atlanta Braves made their first appearance since 2013, and the Milwaukee Brewers made their first appearance since 2011.\nThe postseason began on October 2, and ended on October 28, with the Red Sox defeating the Dodgers in five games in the 2018 World Series. It was the ninth title won by the Red Sox organization, tying the Oakland Athletics for the third most World Series championships.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThe following teams qualified for the postseason:\nPlayoff bracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket/&gt;\n&lt;section end=Bracket/&gt;\nAmerican League Wild Card.\n(4) New York Yankees vs. (5) Oakland Athletics.\nThis was the fourth postseason meeting between the Athletics and Yankees. The Yankees had won the previous three meetings (1981, 2000, 2001). The Yankees defeated the Athletics 7–2 to advance to the ALDS for the second year in a row.\nNational League Wild Card.\n(4) Chicago Cubs vs. (5) Colorado Rockies.\nThe Rockies upset the Cubs in a 13-inning duel, 2–1, to advance to the NLDS for the first time since 2009.\nAmerican League Division Series.\n(1) Boston Red Sox vs. (4) New York Yankees.\nThis was the fourth postseason meeting in the history of the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry. They had last met in the 2004 ALCS, where the Red Sox became the first team in MLB history to win a series after facing a 3–0 series deficit. The Red Sox again defeated the Yankees to advance to the ALCS for the first time since 2013. The Red Sox took Game 1 by one run, but the Yankees evened the series with a 6–2 victory in Game 2. Game 3 was the most notable matchup of the series, as the Red Sox blew out the Yankees 16–1 in Yankee Stadium, handing the Yankees their worst postseason loss ever. The Red Sox took a 4–0 lead in Game 4, and while the Yankees cut their lead to one in the bottom of the ninth, the Red Sox still held on to close out the series.\nThe Yankees and Red Sox would meet once more in the 2021 AL Wild Card Game, which was won by the Red Sox at Fenway Park.\n(2) Houston Astros vs. (3) Cleveland Indians.\nThe Astros swept the Indians to return to the ALCS for the second year in a row. The series was not close — the Astros took Game 1 in a blowout, and won Game 2 by a 3–1 score. The Astros completed the sweep with a blowout victory in Game 3 in Cleveland.\nThis was the last postseason appearance for the Indians until 2020.\nNational League Division Series.\n(1) Milwaukee Brewers vs. (5) Colorado Rockies.\nThe Brewers swept the Rockies to return to the NLCS for the first time since 2011. The Rockies were simply outmatched by the Brewers' offense and pitching, aside from a close extra-innings duel in Game 1, the Brewers took games 2 and 3 in shutouts to move on to the NLCS.\nAs of 2022, this is the last time the Rockies appeared in the postseason.\n(2) Los Angeles Dodgers vs. (3) Atlanta Braves.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between these two teams. The Dodgers defeated the Braves in four games to return to the NLCS for the third year in a row. The Braves were shut out in Games 1 and 2, but managed to win Game 3 by one run. However, the Dodgers won Game 4 to close out the series and move on to the NLCS.\nThe Braves and Dodgers would face each other two more times in the postseason — in the NLCS in 2020 and 2021, with the Dodgers winning the former, and the Braves winning the latter.\nAmerican League Championship Series.\n(1) Boston Red Sox vs. (2) Houston Astros.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Astros and Red Sox. The Red Sox defeated the defending World Series champion Astros in five games and returned to the World Series for the first time since 2013.\nThe Astros stole Game 1 convincingly at Fenway Park thanks to more solid pitching from Justin Verlander. However, the series would tilt the Red Sox's way afterward. Game 2 was an offensive slugfest which the Red Sox narrowly won to even the series headed back to Houston. Nathan Eovaldi kept the Astros' offense at bay in Game 3 as the Red Sox prevailed in a blowout win, 8–2. Game 4 was a back-and-forth offensive duel between both teams, which the Red Sox won 8–6 to take a 3–1 series lead. In Game 5, David Price pitched eight solid innings as the Red Sox jumped out to a big lead early and didn't relinquish it, securing the pennant with a 4–1 victory.\nAs of 2023, this is the last time the Red Sox won the AL pennant. The Astros would return to the ALCS the next year, where they defeated the New York Yankees in six games to return to the World Series. The Red Sox and Astros would meet again in the ALCS in 2021, in which the Astros returned the favor and defeated the Red Sox in six games before falling in the World Series.\nNational League Championship Series.\n(1) Milwaukee Brewers vs. (2) Los Angeles Dodgers.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Brewers and Dodgers. The Dodgers narrowly defeated the Brewers in seven games to return to the World Series for the second year in a row.\nCorey Knebel held off a late rally by the Dodgers in Game 1 as the Brewers won 6–5. In Game 2, the Dodgers overcame a 3–0 Brewers lead by scoring two runs in the seventh and eighth innings to even the series. When the series shifted to Los Angeles, the Brewers' pitching staff pitched a five-hit shutout as the Brewers won 4–0 to take the series lead in Game 3. In Game 4, the Dodgers evened the series after a 13-inning duel thanks to a walk-off RBI single from Cody Bellinger which scored Manny Machado. Game 4 lasted 5 hours and 15 minutes, making it the second longest NLCS game behind only Game 5 of the 1999 NLCS, which lasted 5 hours and 46 minutes. In Game 5, the Dodgers overcame another Brewers lead to win 5–2 and go up 3–2 in the series headed back to Milwaukee. In Game 6, the Brewers jumped out to a big early lead and didn't relinquish it, winning 7–2 to force a seventh game. The Brewers jumped out to an early lead again in Game 7, but it wasn't enough as the Dodgers scored five unanswered runs to secure the pennant.\nThe Dodgers' win was marred by controversy, as the team was accused by the Brewers' Eric Kratz of using a video camera to steal signs. An anonymous source reported to \"The Athletic\" that \"They use video people to get sequences\", and that \"It's known throughout the league. MLB knows it's an issue.\" Kratz also pointed to a moment in the sixth inning of Game 5 when he saw Manny Machado motioning toward Chris Taylor, who was at the plate in what he thought was an attempt to inform him of the upcoming pitch.\nAs of 2023, this is the last time the Brewers appeared in the NLCS. The Dodgers would win their next NL pennant in 2020 over the Atlanta Braves in seven games after trailing 3–1 in the series.\n2018 World Series.\n(AL1) Boston Red Sox vs. (NL2) Los Angeles Dodgers.\nThis was a rematch of the 1916 World Series, which the Red Sox won in five games. Like in that series 102 years ago, history again repeated itself, and the Red Sox defeated the Dodgers in five quick games to win their ninth World Series title in franchise history. This series was known for its Game 3, which the Dodgers won after 18 innings of play, 3–2. Game 3 became the longest World Series game ever played, and was longer than the entirety of the 1939 World Series.\nLike the Astros in the 2017 World Series, the Red Sox after winning this World Series were then marred by a scandal. On January 7, 2020, the Red Sox were implicated in a sign stealing scandal (the team had previously been fined in 2017 for sign stealing) after three unnamed team members told The Athletic that the Red Sox had used their replay room to steal signs of opposing teams during the 2018 season. On January 13, 2020, Manfred stated that he would determine the appropriate punishment for Red Sox manager Alex Cora, who was also implicated in the Astros scandal, when the investigation was completed. The next day, Cora and the Red Sox mutually agreed to part ways and it was announced he would be suspended for the full season. A few days after his season long suspension ended, Cora was re-hired by the team.\nThe Dodgers would return to the World Series in 2020, which they won in six games over the Tampa Bay Rays.\nBroadcasting.\nThis was fifth year of eight-year U.S. TV contracts with ESPN, Fox Sports, and TBS. ESPN aired the National League Wild Card Game, Fox Sports 1 and MLB Network split the National League Division Series, and the Fox broadcast network and Fox Sports 1 split the National League Championship Series. TBS had the American League Wild Card Game, Division Series, and Championship Series, with sister network TNT used as an overflow channel. The World Series then aired on the Fox broadcast network for the 19th consecutive year."

Italo Ferreira, who represents Brazil, is the current champion.\nBrazilian football player, Neymar Jr., was one of the notable attendees of the event. He had flown from Paris to support his fellow countryman and defending Men's Championship Tour leader, Gabriel Medina. In an interview with the WSL, Medina said, \"He's a really good friend. It's good to have that kind of support. He's an inspiration for me.\"\nItalo Ferreira was crowned the champion, defeating Frenchman Joan Duru, who was competing in his first ever Championship Tour final. Ferreira's win also eliminated previous champion Gabriel Medina from the Championship Tour."

        "text": "The 2020–21 UEFA Nations League was the second season of the UEFA Nations League, an international association football competition involving the men's national teams of the 55 member associations of UEFA. The competition was held from September to November 2020 (league phase), October 2021 (Nations League Finals) and March 2022 (relegation play-outs).\nPortugal were the defending champions, having won the inaugural 2019 finals. However, they failed to qualify for the 2021 finals after finishing second in their group behind France. None of the teams that had qualified for the previous UEFA Nations League Finals qualified for the 2021 edition.\nFrance won the final 2–1 against Spain for their first UEFA Nations League title.\nFormat.\nOn 24 September 2019, UEFA announced that a revised format would be used for the 2020–21 edition, the second season of the competition. The 55 UEFA national teams were divided into four leagues, with Leagues A, B and C featuring sixteen teams each, divided into four groups of four teams. League D featured seven teams divided into two groups, with one containing four teams and the other containing three. The teams were allocated to leagues based on the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League overall ranking. Each team now played six matches within their group, except for one group in League D that played four, using the home-and-away round-robin format on double matchdays in September, October, and November 2020. This format ensured that for almost all groups, teams in the same group played their last matches at the same time. It also increased the number of total league phase matches from 138 to 162 and minimized the number of friendly matches.\nIn the top division, League A, teams competed to become the UEFA Nations League champions. The four group winners of League A qualified for the Nations League Finals, which was played in a knockout format consisting of the semi-finals, third place play-off, and final. The semi-final pairings were determined using an open draw. Host country Italy was selected among the four qualified teams by the UEFA Executive Committee, with the winners of the final crowned as the Nations League champions. The video assistant referee (VAR) system was used in the Nations League Finals.\nTeams also competed for promotion and relegation to a higher or lower league. The group winners from Leagues B, C, and D were promoted, while the last-placed teams of each group in Leagues A and B were relegated. As League C had four groups while League D had only two, the two League C teams that were to be relegated were determined by play-outs in March 2022. Based on the Nations League overall ranking of the fourth-placed teams, the first-ranked team faced the fourth-ranked team and the second-ranked team faced the third-ranked team. Two ties were played over two legs, with the higher-ranked team hosting the second leg. The team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs remained in League C, while the loser was relegated to League D. If the aggregate score was level, extra time was played (the away goals rule was not applied). If still tied after extra time, a penalty shoot-out was used to decide the winner. The away goals rule was originally to be used but was abolished by the UEFA Executive Committee on 16 December 2021.\nTiebreakers for group ranking.\nIf two or more teams in the same group were equal on points on completion of the league phase, the following tie-breaking criteria were applied:\nNotes\nCriteria for league ranking.\nIndividual league rankings were established according to the following criteria:\nTo rank teams in League D, which was composed of different-sized groups, the results against the fourth-placed team in Group D1 were not taken into account to compare teams placed first, second, and third in their respective groups.\nThe ranking of the top four teams in League A was determined by their finish in the Nations League Finals (first to fourth).\nCriteria for overall ranking.\nThe overall UEFA Nations League rankings were established as follows:\n2022 FIFA World Cup qualification.\nThe Nations League was partially linked with European qualification for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, with the format confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting in Nyon, Switzerland on 4 December 2019. The qualifying structure depended on results from the Nations League, although to a lesser degree than the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying play-offs. The ten group winners after the first round (group stage) qualified directly for the World Cup. Then, the second round (play-offs) was contested by the ten group runners-up, along with the best two Nations League group winners, based on the Nations League overall ranking, that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. The play-offs were split into three play-off paths, played in two single-match knockout rounds (semi-finals and finals, with the home teams to be drawn), from which an additional three teams also qualified.\nEffects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, the UEFA Executive Committee approved on 28 August 2020 the following principles for the league phase of the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League:\nOn 24 September 2020, UEFA announced that five substitutions would be permitted in Nations League matches during the October and November 2020 international windows. On 31 March 2021, the use of five substitutes was extended to the Nations League Finals in October 2021 and the League C relegation play-outs in March 2022, with these knockout matches permitting a sixth substitution should the match go to extra time. However, each team was only given three opportunities to make substitutions during matches, excluding substitutions made at half-time, before the start of extra time and at half-time in extra time. During the September 2020 window, only three substitutions had been permitted.\nAll matches played in September 2020 were required by UEFA to be held behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. On 1 October 2020, UEFA announced the partial return of spectators to matches beginning in October 2020, restricted to a maximum of 30 percent of the respective stadium capacity. However, the return of spectators was subject to the decision of local authorities, with regional limits taking precedence over UEFA's maximum allowed capacity. Away supporters were not allowed at the venues. Social distancing was mandatory for spectators and additional precautionary measures (such as face masks) were implemented per local regulations.\nSchedule.\nBelow was the schedule of the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League.\nThe Nations League Finals, originally scheduled for 2–6 June 2021, were moved to October 2021 following the rescheduling of UEFA Euro 2020 to June and July 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The scheduling of the league phase was reviewed by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting on 17 June 2020. At the meeting, UEFA decided to adjust the match schedule for October and November 2020 in order for an additional match to be played in each window. This allowed for the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying play-offs, along with the postponed March 2020 international friendlies, to be played on 7–8 October and 11–12 November 2020. Therefore, matchdays 3–6, which originally would spread over three days each during 8–13 October and 12–17 November 2020, would now spread over only two days. The changes to the International Match Calendar for October and November 2020, which extended each window by one day, were approved by the FIFA Council on 25 June 2020.\nThe original fixture list was confirmed by UEFA on 3 March 2020 following the draw. However, due to the change of the league phase calendar, a revised schedule for the October and November 2020 fixtures was released by UEFA on 26 June 2020.\nThe relegation play-outs of League C were scheduled on the same dates as the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying play-offs. If one or more of the teams due to participate in the relegation play-outs had also qualified for the World Cup qualifying play-offs, the relegation play-outs would have been cancelled and the teams in League C ranked 47th and 48th in the Nations League overall ranking would have been automatically relegated.\nSeeding.\nAll 55 UEFA national teams entered the competition. Due to the format change of the competition, no teams were actually relegated from the 2018–19 season. In addition to the group winners, the second-placed teams in Leagues C and D, along with the best-ranked third-placed team of League D, were also promoted.\nIn the 2020–21 access list, UEFA ranked teams based on the 2018–19 Nations League overall ranking, with a slight modification: teams that were originally relegated in the previous season were ranked immediately below teams promoted prior to the format change. The seeding pots for the league phase were based on the access list ranking. The seeding pots, draw procedure and fixture list procedures were confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting in Nyon, Switzerland on 4 December 2019.\nThe draw for the league phase took place at the Beurs van Berlage Conference Centre in Amsterdam, Netherlands on 3 March 2020, 18:00 CET. While the draw typically had restrictions for prohibited clashes, winter venues and excessive travel, no conditions applied to the draw given the allocation of the teams to both leagues and pots.\nOverall ranking.\nThe results of each team were used to calculate the overall ranking of the competition.\n2022 World Cup qualification play-offs.\nThe best two Nations League group winners based on the overall ranking that finished outside the top two of their World Cup qualifying group joined the ten group runners-up in the World Cup qualification second round (play-offs)."

The team was coached by Ray Reilly, and in only its second season of existence, went 8–0 against its division of the Eastern Collegiate Volleyball League (ECVL), winning its division and finishing third in the league championship. In the program's final year, the team, led by All-East players David Baird and Tony Zortea, defeated a top ten team for the first time in program history, finished third in the ECVL, and was ranked 12th in the final NCAA volleyball poll. Competitive intercollegiate men's volleyball at the university now exists as a non-varsity club sport."

        "text": "The 2019 ATP Finals (also known as the 2019 Nitto ATP Finals for sponsorship reasons) was a men's tennis tournament played at the O2 Arena on indoor hard courts in London, United Kingdom, from 10 to 17 November 2019. It was the season-ending event for the highest-ranked singles players and doubles teams on the 2019 ATP Tour and was the 50th edition of the tournament (45th in doubles). The singles event was won by Stefanos Tsitsipas over Dominic Thiem in three sets. In doubles, Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut defeated Raven Klaasen and Michael Venus in straight sets.\nFinals.\nSingles.\n Stefanos Tsitsipas defeated Dominic Thiem, 6–7(6–8), 6–2, 7–6(7–4)\nDoubles.\n Pierre-Hugues Herbert / Nicolas Mahut defeated Raven Klaasen / Michael Venus 6–3, 6–4\nFormat.\nThe ATP Finals group stage had a round-robin format, with eight players/teams divided into two groups of four and each player/team in a group playing the other three in the group. The eight seeds were determined by the ATP rankings and ATP Doubles Team Rankings on the Monday after the last ATP Tour tournament of the calendar year. All singles matches, including the final, were best of three sets with tie-breaks in each set including the third. All doubles matches were two sets (no ad) and a Match Tie-break.\nIn deciding placement within a group, the following criteria were used, in order:\nCriteria 4–6 were used only in the event of a three-way tie; if one of these criteria decided a winner or loser among the three, the remaining two would have been ranked by head-to-head result.\nThe top two of each group advanced to semifinals, with the winner of each group playing the runner-up of the other group. The winners of the semifinals then played for the title.\nQualification.\nSingles.\nEight players competed at the tournament, with two named alternates. Players received places in the following order of precedence:\nIn the event of this totaling more than 8 players, those lower down in the selection order become the alternates. If further alternates are needed, these players are selected by the ATP.\nProvisional rankings were published weekly as the \"ATP Race to London\", coinciding with the 52-week rolling ATP rankings on the date of selection. Points were accumulated in Grand Slam, ATP Tour, ATP Challenger Tour and ITF Futures tournaments from the 52 weeks prior to the selection date, with points from the previous years Tour Finals excluded. Players accrued points across 18 tournaments, usually made up of:\nAll players must include the ranking points for mandatory Masters tournaments for which they are on the original acceptance list and for all Grand Slams for which they would be eligible, even if they do not compete (in which case they receive zero points). Furthermore, players who finished 2018 in the world's top 30 are \"commitment players\" who must (if not injured) include points for the 8 mandatory Masters tournament regardless of whether they enter, and who must compete in at least 4 ATP 500 tournaments (though the Monte Carlo Masters may count to this total), of which one must take place after the US Open. Zero point scores may also be taken from withdrawals by non-injured players from ATP 500 tournaments according to certain other conditions outlined by the ATP. Beyond these rules, however, a player may substitute his next best tournament result for missed Masters and Grand Slam tournaments.\nPlayers may have their ATP Tour Masters 1000 commitment reduced by one tournament, by reaching each of the following milestones:\nIf a player satisfies all three of these conditions, their mandatory ATP Tour Masters 1000 commitment is dropped entirely. Players must be in good standing as defined by the ATP as to avail of the reduced commitment.\nDoubles.\nEight teams compete at the tournament, with one named alternates. The eight competing teams receive places according to the same order of precedence as in Singles. The named alternate will be offered first to any unaccepted teams in the selection order, then to the highest ranked unaccepted team, and then to a team selected by the ATP. Points are accumulated in the same competitions as for the Singles tournament. However, for Doubles teams there are no commitment tournaments, so teams are ranked according to their 18 highest points scoring results from any tournaments.\nQualified players.\nSingles.\nOn 10 July, Rafael Nadal became the first qualifier to the event, qualifying for the 15th time.\nRafael Nadal began his season at the Australian Open and got through the final without dropping a set, However, he lost to Novak Djokovic in the final in straight sets.

        "text": "The Americas Pacific Challenge (APC) is a rugby union tournament funded by World Rugby that serves as a development competition for Americas and Pacific island nations. It provides a way to prepare players for participation with their senior national men's teams during international tests and in the Rugby World Cup qualification cycle.\nThe competition has been hosted by the Uruguayan Rugby Union since 2016, with all games played in Montevideo. Prior to its creation, two teams from the Americas had played in the Pacific Challenge, hosted by Fiji in 2015. This was reversed in 2016 with two Pacific Island teams joining the inaugural APC which effectively replaced the previous format of the Americas Rugby Championship. \nHistory.\nThe APC was first contested in October 2016 by the national 'A' teams of Argentina, Canada, Fiji, Samoa, Uruguay and United States. Tonga took the place of the Fijian team for the 2017 competition, and retained that place in 2018.\nThe competition had a two-year hiatus which encompassed the 2019 Rugby World Cup and a 2020 season disrupted by impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Teams from Brazil, Chile and Paraguay took part for the first time in the 2021 Challenge, but the Pacific Islands did not participate due to difficulties with COVID-19 travel logistics.\nFormat.\nThe Americas Pacific Challenge uses a split pool format wherein the six competing teams are divided into two pools of three. Each team plays one match against each of the teams in the opposite pool. The tournament's winner is decided based upon the number of points accumulated from each match.\nParticipating teams.\nThe final placings of all teams for each year are recorded in the table below as numbers (where 1 denotes first place, 2 denotes second, etc). The host nation's placing is shown in bold. A dash (–) is recorded in the year column if a team did not compete at a tournament."

        "text": "The 2018–19 European Rugby Challenge Cup pool stage is the first stage of the competition in the fifth season of the European Rugby Challenge Cup. The competition involves twenty teams competing across five pools of four teams for eight quarter-final places – awarded to the five pool winners and the three top-ranked pool runners-up. The pool stage begins on 13 October 2018 and is due to be completed on 18 January 2019.\nSeeding.\nThe 20 competing teams were seeded and split into four tiers; seeding was based on performance in their respective domestic leagues. Where promotion and relegation is in effect in a league, the promoted team was seeded last, or (if multiple teams are promoted) by performance in the lower competition.\nTeams will be taken from a league in order of rank and put into a tier. A draw will be used to allocate two second seeds to Tier 1; the remaining team goes into Tier 2. This allocation indirectly determines which fourth-seeded team entered Tier 2, while the others enter Tier 3.\nGiven the nature of the Continental Shield – a competition including developing rugby nations and Italian clubs not competing in the Pro14 – the two qualifiers from that competition were automatically included in Tier 4 and are seeded equally, despite officially being ranked 1 and 2 from that competition.\nThe brackets show each team's seeding and their league (for example, \"1 Top 14\" indicates the team was seeded 1st from the Top 14).\nPool stage.\nThe draw will take place on 20 June 2018 in the Olympic Museum, Lausanne, Switzerland.\nTeams in the same pool will play each other twice, both at home and away in the group stage, that will begin in October 2018, and continue through to January 2019, before the pool winners and three best runners-up progressed to the quarter-finals.\nTeams will be awarded competition points, based on match result. Teams receive four points for a win, two points for a draw, one attacking bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match and one defensive bonus point for losing a match by seven points or fewer.\nIn the event of a tie between two or more teams, the following tie-breakers will be used, as directed by EPCR:"

        "text": "Fitness Boxing is a fitness video game developed by Imagineer for the Nintendo Switch. The game was released on December 20, 2018 in Japan by Imagineer, December 21, 2018 in PAL territories and January 4, 2019 in North America by Nintendo.\n\"Fitness Boxing\" is the successor to the \"Shape Boxing\" trilogy released on the Wii, with the first two installments rebranded as licensed Gold's Gym fitness games in at least North America.\nTwo sequels, known as Fitness Boxing 2: Rhythm and Exercise and Fitness Boxing: Fist of the North Star, were released for the Nintendo Switch on December 4, 2020 and March 3, 2023, respectively. A third sequel, titled Fitness Boxing feat. Hatsune Miku: Isshoni Exercise, was released on March 7, 2024 in Japan.\nAs announced on August 30, 2023, \"Fitness Boxing\" was delisted from digital retailers on November 30 in all regions, likely due to expired music licenses.\nGameplay.\nThe gameplay involves using the Joy-Con motion controllers to perform punches and dodging maneuvers. The workouts recommend a full body stretching exercise both at the start and end of the workouts. The difficulty and complexity of the workouts increase gradually over time. Free exercises are always available, regardless of if daily workout has been completed or not. The score for each exercise (excluding the stretches) is determined by how precise the player is in performing their punches and maneuvers.\n\"Fitness Boxing\" comes with charts that determines estimated fitness age and calorie burn based on the height and weight of the player. The game will periodically request the player to update their height and weight. The routine, length and intensity of daily workouts can be adjusted by the player at any time.\nThe default coach is Lin, and there is a total of 5 other coaches (3 female and 2 male), each with customizable appearances. New costumes can be unlocked by performing achievements. The coaches demonstrate every maneuver involved in each exercise, making them a visual guide for maintaining rhythm. They also provide the players tips both during and outside of the exercises.\nPlaylist.\nFitness Boxing contains a playlist of instrumental versions of popular pop songs that is played with each workout exercise.\nThe songs featured in the original \"Fitness Boxing\" are;\nThe songs featured in \"Fitness Boxing 2: Rhythm &amp; Exercise\" are;\nDevelopment.\n\"Fitness Boxing\" was first announced by Imagineer on June 14, 2018. It was developed by former Rocket Company members working for Imagineer.\nIn late-September 2018, Imagineer revealed the release date of \"Fitness Boxing\" for Japan and in early-October 2018, Nintendo revealed the release date of \"Fitness Boxing\" for North America and Europe as well as screenshots of game play.\nIn late-October 2018, Imagineer revealed the track listing for \"Fitness Boxing\" and uploaded the first game play video of \"Fitness Boxing\" to their YouTube Channel.\nRelease and promotion.\nOn November 29, 2018, a \"Fitness Boxing\" demo was released on the European Nintendo eShop for the Switch and a demo was released on the North American eShop on December 13, 2018.\n\"Fitness Boxing\" was released both digitally and physically on December 20, 2018, in Japan, December 21, 2018, in Europe and Australia and January 4, 2019, in North America.\nOn January 15, 2019, Nintendo held a promotional event for \"Fitness Boxing\" at Nintendo New York, which included a group of women led by Instagram fitness influencer Niki Klasnic playing the game.\nRelated media.\nOn August 26, 2021, an anime television series adaptation produced by Imagineer and Story Effect was announced. This anime series is directed and written by Junpei Morita, with motion capture by SOLID CUBE and music composed by Yūsuke Shirato. It premiered on October 1, 2021, on Tokyo MX.\nReception.\n\"Fitness Boxing\" received \"mixed or average\" reviews from critics according to Metacritic with a score of 66 out of 100, based on reviews from 14 critics.\nNintendo Life gave \"Fitness Boxing\" a 8/10; calling it \"no substitute for hard hours at the gym\", but still recommended the game as a workout regimen for being energetic, entertaining, and cheaper than a gym membership. Nintendo World Report gave \"Fitness Boxing\" a 7.5/10; praising it for having multiple exercises for various skill levels, but criticized the limited number of musical tracks. Nintendo Wire gave \"Fitness Boxing\" a 7.0/10, praising it for having a \"decent selection of punches to throw\" and for allowing the user to track their progress day-to-day, but criticized the game for its \"lack of variety\" and for having \"repetitive music and trainer dialog\".\nDualShockers gave \"Fitness Boxing\" a 6.5 out of 10, saying that the game \"just suffers from feeling inaccurate, even more so when punches and dodges aren’t correctly registered by the Joy-Cons [sic]\", but praised the game for being \"perfect for those who want to lead a healthy and active lifestyle\". Destructoid gave \"Fitness Boxing\" a 7/10, saying that \"There could be some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun.\"\nThe \"Reno Gazette-Journal\" gave \"Fitness Boxing\" a 6 out of 10, saying that \"Fitness Boxing works great as a fitness app but not so much as a game.\"\nSales.\nFrom January 7, 2019, to January 13, \"Fitness Boxing\" placed 20th on Japanese sales charts, selling 3,024 physical copies during that period.\nIn February 2019, \"Fitness Boxing\" started experiencing shortages in Japan.\nIn September 2020, Imagineer announced that the game had sold over 1 million copies worldwide."

        "title": "2023 Ryder Cup",
        "text": "The 44th Ryder Cup was a series of golf matches between teams representing the DP World Tour (Europe) and the PGA of America (United States) for the Ryder Cup, that was held in Italy from 29 September to 1 October 2023 at Marco Simone Golf and Country Club in Guidonia Montecelio, northeast of Rome. The biennial event was originally scheduled for 2022, before the 43rd matches were postponed into 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe team captains were Luke Donald for Europe and Zach Johnson for the United States; Donald replaced Henrik Stenson, who was removed from the role by the European Tour after joining LIV Golf. Each team of twelve players was made up of six automatic qualifiers and six captain's picks. The top thirteen players in the Official World Golf Ranking played in the event, the first time the entire top ten had done so since the inauguration of the rankings in 1986. The matches were contested with four foursomes and four fourball matches on each of the first two days, with twelve singles matches on Sunday. Europe went into the matches undefeated in Europe since 1993; they required 14 to regain the trophy they last won in 2018; as holder of the trophy, having won in 2021, the USA needed 14 points to retain it. \nIn the opening foursomes matches on Friday morning, Europe secured a clean sweep to jump into a 4–0 lead. In the fourballs in the afternoon, the USA were unable to hold onto leads in several of the matches and fell further behind as Europe went into day two ahead, 6–1. On Saturday morning, Max Homa and Brian Harman won the USA their first match of the event, but with Europe winning the remaining three foursomes, including a record 9 and 7 victory for Viktor Hovland and rookie Ludvig Åberg over world number one Scottie Scheffler and PGA champion Brooks Koepka, the lead was extended to 9–2. In the afternoon fourballs, the USA won their first session to cut the deficit to 5 points, at 10–5.\nOn Sunday, Europe secured the first point as Hovland defeated Collin Morikawa; another half point came when Jon Rahm tied his match with Scheffler by winning the 18th hole. When Rory McIlroy and Tyrrell Hatton won their matches, Europe required just half a point from the remaining seven matches out on the course. The next four matches to finish all went to Team USA. Europe's victory was ensured when Tommy Fleetwood won the 16th hole to go dormie two up against Rickie Fowler; Fleetwood won the 17th hole to confirm the win for Team Europe. A win for Robert MacIntyre over U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark in match twelve, and a tie for Shane Lowry against Jordan Spieth brought the final score to 16–11.\nHost selection.\nThe bidding process for the 44th edition of Ryder Cup opened on 23 June 2014. Countries had until 31 August to formally express an interest. These expressions had to come either from a central government or a national golf governing body. On 14 December 2015, Rome was announced as the host of 44th Ryder Cup. Italy beat Germany, Austria and Spain to win the bid.\nBidding locations\nDeclared an interest but did not enter an official bid\nFormat.\nThe Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point. The competition format will be as follows:\nOn the first two days there are 4 foursome matches and 4 fourball matches with the home captain choosing which are played in the morning and which in the afternoon.\nWith a total of 28 points available, 14 points are required to win the Cup, and 14 points are required for the defending champion to retain the Cup. All matches are played to a maximum of 18 holes.\nTeam selection.\nEurope.\nThe European team qualification rules were announced on 30 August 2022. There were several changes from the previous Ryder Cup, with three qualifiers from each of the European and World points lists and the number of captain's picks increased from three to six; the weighting of points was also changed, with highest ranked events now worth 4 times the lowest, having been six times the value previously.\nOn 9 August 2023, Masters Champion Jon Rahm and Rory McIlroy were confirmed after securing their spots via the European points list. On 15 August 2023, Viktor Hovland qualified via the World points list. On 27 August 2023, Tyrrell Hatton qualified via the World points list. The final automatic qualifiers were confirmed on 3 September 2023, at the conclusion of Omega European Masters, as Robert MacIntyre, via the European points list, and Matt Fitzpatrick via the World points list. Luke Donald announced his six captain's picks the following day; they were Tommy Fleetwood, Sepp Straka, Justin Rose, Shane Lowry, Nicolai Højgaard, and Ludvig Åberg, who won the final qualifying event and had been a professional for less than three months.\nThe leading players in the final points lists were:\nUnited States.\nThe United States qualification rules were confirmed along with the announcement of Johnson as captain on 28 February 2022. There was no change from the amended selection process used for the previous Ryder Cup, with six players qualifying from the Ryder Cup points list and six captain's picks.\nPoints were awarded as follows:\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler and U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark secured their qualification in advance of the BMW Championship. Open Champion Brian Harman, Patrick Cantlay, Max Homa and Xander Schauffele were the remaining four qualifiers. The six captain's picks were announced on 29 August 2023, two days after the conclusion of the Tour Championship; they were PGA champion Brooks Koepka, Jordan Spieth, Collin Morikawa, Sam Burns, Rickie Fowler and Justin Thomas.

        "title": "1889 Southern Rugby Union season",
        "text": "The 1889 Southern Rugby Football Union season was the 16th season of the Sydney Rugby Premiership. This was the seventh competition for the Gardiner Challenge Cup which was awarded to the winners of the premiership. The football season lasted from May to August. Sydney University Football Club successfully defended the premiership, completing the season undefeated for the third time. During the season a number of representative matches were played. In June players were selected to represent New South Wales against a visiting intercolonial team known as the New Zealand Natives. A representative team from Victoria visited Sydney in July, while a New South Wales team visited Queensland in August.\nTeams.\nThe Gardiner Challenge Cup was open to all clubs who were part of the Union upon payment of an entry fee. After being rejected by the clubs last season, a Junior Cup was held for all Junior Clubs to enter. In addition to this, a Union Cup was also held for all second fifteens of senior or junior clubs, or those clubs who did not enter either of the other cups. When entries closed for the different competitions on the 10th May there were 14 entries into the Gardiner Challenge Cup, 11 entries into the Junior Cup and 16 entries for the Union Cup.\nOf the senior clubs, three did not survive to the new season. Both Burwood and Balmain Wellington folded during the previous season's play, while Balmain did not survive into the new year. Five junior clubs entered into the Senior Cup: Strathfield, Elvira, Randwick, Double Bay and Cammeray. Three new clubs were formed and entered the senior ranks: Zealandia, Parramatta and Strathfield Rovers. Zealandia was a club made up of players from New Zealand, similar to the old Gordon club. Parramatta was an amalgamation of the Nomad and Union clubs. The Union also allowed Sydney University to enter a second team into the competition. Unfortunately, the Strathfield Rovers did not see out the season, lasting only one match before being disbanded.\nRule Changes.\nThe 1889 Sydney Rugby Premiership returned to its usual starting slot of mid-May. For the third season, entries for the senior cup were open to all member clubs of the Union for a fee. Prior to the season beginning, a meeting of the Southern Rugby Football Union saw much debate concerning the allocation of points during a match. It was proposed that the points be amended with tries receiving a greater score. The amendment was carried with points now being allocated as such: Tries- 3 points, Goals- 2 points, Goal from the field- 4 points. Once the entries had closed, a draw was written which took into account the numerous representative matches that were planned for the season. It was decided that the premiership would be put on hold when these important games took place. This meant that teams would only be able to play seven matches which would not allow them to play against each of the senior teams in the competition. With the long list of senior clubs, it was seen as a mistake by the Union to write up such a draw.\nSeason Summary.\nThe past season of football was seen as being productive of grand all round play among the different clubs. Many players lifted the quality of their game play, resulting in them coming into consideration for representative matches. Chief amongst these were Paddy Flynn and Percy Colquhoun of Sydney University, and James McMahon of Rosedale. For his team, Flynn displayed exceptional kicking skills that saw great benefit to the scoring capabilities of the 'Varsity. His accuracy at kicking a goal from the field was seen as developing the game further. McMahon was exceptional in his tackling, saving many a certain try. A unique tackling style, he waits patiently for his prey before pouncing upon them around the waist bringing them to the turf. Over the previous seasons, Percy Colquhoun had shown to be a valuable member of any team that he was a part of. However his performances during the season were of the very best form with his performance against McMahon in the 'Varsity match against Rosedale the highest point.\nFor the third season in a row, the Sydney University Football Club completed the season undefeated. Since the beginning of the 1887 season, the team had won 24 matches and drew only 1. Over the course of these games, University had scored 334 points with only 27 points scored against them. From the beginning of the premiership, the 'Varsity were playing grandly together with many a selfless act. They out-paced all other teams with exception to only the visiting Māori's. Three times they held their opponents scoreless, while the remaining games saw only three tries scored against them. Their match against Wallaroo resulted in University winning by 54 points to nil. It was reported that their game play was brilliant rendering their opponents almost paralysed. The slippery wet conditions that was the scene of their match against Arfoma limited the free and open play that was characteristic of both teams. With both clubs being undefeated prior to the match, much interest was held in the result. A tight and rough game saw the 'Varsity hold on to win 9 points to 7.\nThe only blemish to the 'Varsity's perfect season was that the two top teams did not meet each other on the field of battle. With the draw only taking into account 7 games, the new senior club of Strathfield did not face the eventual premiers. Strathfield had a favourable draw with the club also avoiding matches against the in-form Arfoma and Rosedale teams. As a result, the club remained undefeated having played only lower ranked teams. Their strength as a team had not been sufficiently tested.\nDuring the course of the season, the Arfoma Football Club performed well, winning all but their match against the eventual premiers. Most of their games were played against lower ranked teams which they won easily. Arfoma defeated Rosedale early in the season before maintaining an unbeaten run until their loss at the end of the season against University. Out of their number, Fred Hillyar, Albert Sefton and D Walker were chosen for representative duties.\nLower Grades.\nJunior Badges.\nAfter refusing to play for a cup during the previous season, the Junior clubs recognised that the decision was detrimental to their success. With falling crowd numbers and less attention in the press, many questioned the wisdom in not playing for a cup or trophy. As soon as the new season began, the Union arranged for there to be a Junior Badges competition for those clubs not entered into the senior competition. Eleven entries were received, with a draw written, games were scheduled from 25 May to 24 August. At the end of the season, Petersham and the Artillery faced off in a match at the Randwick Reserve that was seen as the \"final\". Petersham won the match 12 points to nil and were awarded the Junior Badges. As they had the harder draw, they Petersham were seen to be worthy winners of the badges.\nUnion Badges.\nA condition of the Union Cup proceeding in 1888 was that a Junior Cup would be played. With the Junior clubs refusing the cup offered, no Union Cup was held. At the beginning of the new season, the Union decided to set up a Junior Badges competition and with that a Union Badges competition. The Union Badges saw sixteens teams enter the competition. These teams were a mix of seconds from the senior clubs and clubs who did not enter the Junior Badges. The draw saw ten rounds with teams playing nine games during the season. A final was held between Rosedale Seconds and Double Bay Seconds who were both undefeated during the regular games. Despite Double Bay holding all of their opponents scoreless, Rosedale won the match 7 points to 3 in one of the best contests held at the Agricultural Ground. Rosedale Seconds were declared winners of the Union Badges.\nRepresentative Games.\nThe New Zealand Natives Tour.\nJoseph Warbrick, a Māori rugby player who represented New Zealand during their 1884 tour of Australia, conceived the idea of assembling a team of native footballers from New Zealand to tour Britain. A wholly private enterprise, the team initially contained full-blooded Māori players with part-Māori players later added. The team left for England 1 August 1888 arriving in London on 27 September. While touring Britain the Natives played 74 matches including three international matches, one each against Ireland, Wales and England. By the time the team left England on 29 March 1889, they had developed into a formidable team winning two-thirds of their matches. After playing a few games in Melbourne to the Victorian rules, the Natives travelled to Sydney in mid-June.\nThe first match between New South Wales and the New Zealand Natives was held on 15 June at the Association Cricket Ground. Prior to the beginning of the match, the Natives performed a version of the Haka recorded in newspapers of the time as, \"Ake ake kia kaha!\" Within the first minute of the match starting, the Natives scored their first try. By halftime, the score stood at New Zealand 6 points to New South Wales' 5. In the second half, the locals briefly took the lead off of a kick from the field. Many times during the match, James McMahon provided the try saving tackle as the Natives consistently attacked the New South Wales line. Despite this, the Natives scored again winning the match 12 points to 9.\nWith New South Wales making changes to the team ahead of the second match, there was much excitement. The changes were effective as the locals held the Natives scoreless until into the second half with scores standing at 9 points to nil at halftime. Once again James McMahon played a grand tackling game stopping many a strong attack from the Natives. With the score against them, the Natives \"played up to high pressure\", attacking the New South Wales line repeatedly. Three quick tries saw the visitors take the lead before New South Wales brought the score back to one point difference. In the remaining time both teams had a chance to score thwarted by excellent play from the opposition. In the dying minutes, the Natives were able to break through and score the match winning try. The final points stood at 16 points to 12 in favour of the visitors. The match was considered the best game of football seen within the colony.\nIntercolonial Matches.\nNew South Wales v. Victoria\nWith Australian Rules Football holding a strong position in Victoria, it wasn't until 1888 that the Melbourne Rugby Union was formed. A Victorian team was formed to play against the visiting English side later that season. In 1889 a Victorian team was chosen to tour the northern colonies with two matches arranged against New South Wales. In the first match the home team held a strong position, leading the game 8 points to nil at halftime. Despite the visitors scoring two tries, New South Wales won the match 13 points to 6. The second match proved to be a much closer affair. New South Wales scored the first try of the game and after weathering many attempts at their goal line, the home team were leading 10 points to 5 at halftime. During the second half, New South Wales continued to add to their total leading 17 points to 5 at one stage. Victoria began to put on the pressure, scoring a try and two goals. Unfortunately the comeback was not enough with New South Wales winning the match 17 points to 14.\nQueensland v. New South Wales\nThe customary intercolonial matches between New South Wales and Queensland were held in August at the conclusion of the Sydney premiership. New South Wales traveled to Brisbane to compete against the locals in two matches. Despite the Southern Rugby Union deciding to change the points system for 1889, it was agreed that the two matches would be played according to the older system. This meant that tries were worth 2 points and goals 3 points.\nThe first match was held at the Exhibition Ground at Bowen Park. Accompanying the match was an exhibition in the parklands. This assisted in increasing the numbers at the game as many entered the grounds out of curiosity. The game was seen to be a tight tussle with the eventual victors having fought hard to earn the win. At halftime New South Wales held the lead 12 points to 5 thanks to Paddy Flynn scoring and converting his own try. With play consistently moving across the field, the visitors continued to add to their points score winning the match 19 points to 12.\nRain failed to keep away the crowds for the second intercolonial match. Despite the slippery conditions the first half was entirely one-sided with New South Wales leading 13 points to nil at halftime. The visitors failed to press home their advantage in the second half with Queensland scoring 10 unanswered points. Unfortunately time ran out for the locals with New South Wales holding on to win the match 13 points to 10."

        "title": "Dawn Fraser Swimming Pool",
        "text": "Dawn Fraser Swimming Pool is a heritage-listed swimming baths complex at Glassop Street, Balmain, Inner West Council, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It was built by 1882 by James Reynolds, with alterations when it was enlarged in 1924. It is also known as Elkington Park Baths, Balmain Baths, Corporation Baths, Dawn Fraser Baths and Whitehorse Point Baths. The property is owned by the Inner West Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 23 June 2000.\nHistory.\nBalmain Council acquired land at White Horse Point for public baths in 1880. A tender by James Reynolds was accepted in 1881 and the baths were in use by January 1882. They were open to men during daylight hours and at limited times for women.\nThe Balmain Swimming Club was founded in 1884 shortly after the baths were opened. When it celebrated its centenary, it was the first club to do so. The club is also thought to be the first swimming association in Australia and many of its members have achieved distinction in swimming, water polo, diving and life-saving.\nIn 1902 the original 1882 enclosure was replaced with one giving a width of 60 yards owing to pressure from the club. A two-storey changing and viewing pavilion (south) was added as well as two boardwalks extending out from the shore and one diagonal boardwalk. In 1904 a cottage was built in Elkington Park for the manager of the baths.\nIn 1924 the baths and structures were enlarged. Other main alterations were a north facing changing pavilion and grandstand, two springboards and a tower, a two-storey entry pavilion in the south pavilion, changing boxes on the west and east boardwalks, and the Western Shed. Swimmers who used the baths included Tony Fenech, Frank Jordan and Dawn Fraser. Repairs and alterations were carried out in 1956, 1957, 1959; a seating gallery was installed in 1961 and a stone wall was built around the children's pool in 1962.\nIn 1964 the pool was renamed in honour of Dawn Fraser, local resident and Olympic Swimming Champion at three consecutive Olympic Games. Dawn Fraser learnt to swim at the baths and swam with the Leichhardt-Balmain League of Swimmers from age 8 to 13. She then had two seasons with the Balmain Ladies Club and won two New South Wales Championships.\nIn 1983 the complex was refurbished and at this time much of the fabric of the building was replaced, the lattice was rebuilt and reinstated and the exterior cladding around the edge of the baths above the water was changed from corrugated iron to timber.\nDescription.\nAn irregular shaped swimming pool, enclosed by a timber structure, supported by timber piles where it is above the harbour. The main swimming area is almost square with the southern side curved to follow the shore. In the south-west corner, a wedge-shaped children's pool has been made to fit in with the existing configuration. The entrance to the baths is marked by a squat tower, which separates two timber buildings following the curve of the foreshore and contain the changing rooms for men and women and the swimming pool office. The buildings on the harbour side house the Balmain Swimming Club including club change rooms and there is also a tiered stand for spectators. The room in the tower houses the archives of the swimming club, which go back to 1884 and also served as a club meeting rooms. The pool itself is surrounded by a timber deck used for access, watching swimming races and sunbaking. At low tides there is a small sandy beach alongside the entrance.\nNearby, in Elkington Park, is a brick cottage for the manager of the baths.\nHeritage listing.\nThe pool is a complete swimming complex extending back to the turn-of-the century. It is an excellent example of pool architecture no longer practiced and a well known Sydney landmark set in an attractive harbourside location which has become a feature of the pool. It is representative of the development of a harbourside recreational and social facility and is associated with prominent swimming identities and world champions. It provides evidence of the major popularity of swimming as a competitive and recreational sport in Australia.\nDawn Fraser Swimming Pool was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 23 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\nIt is the most complete swimming complex extending back to the turn-of-the century. It is associated with Dawn Fraser a local resident and Olympic Swimming Champion at three consecutive Olympic games.\nThe place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.\nIt is an excellent example of pool architecture no longer practices and a well known Sydney landmark set in an attractive harbourside location which has become a feature of the pool.\nThe place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\nIt is socially significant as a local recreational landmark and the home of the Balmain Swimming Club - probably the oldest swimming club in Australia. It provides evidence of the major popularity of swimming as a competitive and recreational sport in Australia.\nThe place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\nOne of the few remaining tidal public pools in Sydney Harbour and the only one to retain its over-water-enclosure."

He attended Boylan Catholic for three years before his family moved to North Dakota. He then attended Shanley High School in Fargo, North Dakota. Arnold attended college at University of Wisconsin-Platteville where he competed in the 110m hurdles. Arnold came second in the Division 3 110m hurdle championship, where he ran faster than Conor Murtagh, who finished in 3rd and Jacek Pikul who finished 6th.\nProfessional career.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nArnold went undrafted in the 2017 NFL Draft, but received invitations to attend rookie minicamp and tryout for the Kansas City Chiefs and New Orleans Saints. On June 5, 2017, the Saints signed Arnold to a three-year, $1.66 million contract.\nOn June 16, 2017, the Saints placed Arnold on injured reserve due to an unspecified injury. Arnold was initially waived/injured, but was placed on injured reserve after clearing waivers.\nOn July 26, 2018, it was reported that the New Orleans Saints' coaching staff had elected to move Arnold from wide receiver to tight end. Arnold was moved in order for him to have a better chance of making the roster. The move was partly due to the release of tight end Coby Fleener, leaving the a lack of depth at the position. Assistant head coach/tight ends coach Dan Campbell oversaw Arnold's transition to tight end and Arnold credits him with his success at tight end.\nThroughout training camp, Arnold competed to be the third tight end on the depth chart against Michael Hoomanawanui, John Phillips, Garrett Griffin, and Deon Yelder. Arnold impressed the coaches with his ability during training camp and made the active 53-man roster. Head coach Sean Payton named Arnold the third tight end on the Saints' depth chart to begin the regular season, behind veterans Benjamin Watson and Josh Hill.\nArnold was inactive for the first four regular season games (Weeks 1–4) as a healthy scratch. On October 8, 2018, he made his NFL debut during the Saints' 43–19 win against the Washington Redskins in Week 5. In Week 7, he made his first career reception, a ten-yard reception from Saints' quarterback Drew Brees during the second quarter of a 24–23 win at the Baltimore Ravens. He finished the game with two receptions for 35 yards. On November 11, 2018, Arnold earned his first career start and made two receptions for 25 yards as the Saints defeated the Cincinnati Bengals 51–14 in Week 10. On November 22, 2018, Arnold scored his first touchdown against the Atlanta Falcons on a 25-yard reception. He appeared in ten games and started one in the 2018 season. He finished with 12 receptions for 150 yards and a touchdown.\nOn August 31, 2019, Arnold was waived by the Saints and was signed to the practice squad the next day. He was promoted to the active roster on October 19, 2019. On December 4, 2019, Arnold was waived by the Saints.\nArizona Cardinals.\nOn December 5, 2019, Arnold was claimed off waivers by the Arizona Cardinals. He finished the 2019 season with eight receptions for 127 yards and two touchdowns.\nIn Week 13 of the 2020 season against the Los Angeles Rams, Arnold recorded two catches for 61 yards that both resulted in touchdowns during the 38–28 loss. In the 2020 season, he appeared in 16 games and started five. He recorded 31 receptions for 438 receiving yards and four receiving touchdowns.\nCarolina Panthers.\nOn March 19, 2021, Arnold signed a two-year contract with the Carolina Panthers.\nJacksonville Jaguars.\nOn September 27, 2021, Arnold was traded to the Jacksonville Jaguars along with a 2022 third-round pick in exchange for cornerback C. J. Henderson and a 2022 fifth-round pick. He suffered a sprained MCL in Week 12 and was placed on injured reserve on November 30, 2021. In the 2021 season, he appeared in 11 games and started four. He had 35 receptions for 408 yards.\nIn the 2022 season, Arnold appeared in all 17 regular season games and both playoff games for the Jaguars. He had nine receptions for 135 yards.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nArnold was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles on May 4, 2023.

He previously played for Texas Tech from 2018 through 2020, and for Michigan in 2021 and 2022.\nEarly life and high school career.\nBowman attended Grapevine High School in Grapevine, Texas. As a junior, Bowman was elected the District 8-5A Overall MVP in 2016.&lt;ref name=\"24/7 High School\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In his senior year, Bowman threw for 3,570 yards and 38 touchdowns. He was rated as a three star recruit by both 247Sports.com and Rivals.com. Bowman committed to Texas Tech on June 15, 2017 over schools such as Ole Miss, Arkansas, Missouri and Houston.\nCollege career.\nTexas Tech.\nBowman entered his freshman year at Texas Tech in 2018 in a three-way battle for the starting position against junior McLane Carter and sophomore Jett Duffey, with Carter being named the starter for the week 1 game against Ole Miss. Bowman entered the game in the 2nd quarter after Carter suffered a high ankle sprain. Bowman went 29/49 for 273 yards with a touchdown in the 27–47 loss. Bowman was named the starter for the week 2 match-up against Lamar, completing 22-of-25 passes for 282 yards with 2 touchdowns, only playing the first half of the game. A week later on September 15, Bowman had a historic game against Houston, completing 43-of-59 passes for 605 yards with five touchdowns in the 63–49 win. Bowman's 605 yards set a Big 12 record for most passing yards in a game by a freshman. On September 29 against West Virginia, Bowman left the game right before halftime after being sandwiched between two defenders with an apparent upper-body injury; it was later revealed that Bowman had suffered a partially collapsed lung. Bowman returned from injury on October 20 for the Red Raiders' game against Kansas; Bowman finished 36/46 for 408 yards with three touchdowns and an interception. On November 3 against Oklahoma, Bowman left the game at halftime for an unknown reason. It was later revealed that he had a re-occurrence of a partially collapsed lung; Bowman was discharged from the hospital on November 7. Bowman finished his freshman year with 227 completions out of 327 attempts for 2,638 yards with 17 touchdowns and 7 interceptions.\nBowman started in Texas Tech's first game of the 2019 season against Montana State, his first game since November 3, 2018. Bowman played most of the game, completing 40 passes out of 53 attempts for 436 yards with two touchdowns along with a rushing touchdown in the 45–10 victory. On September 14 Bowman suffered a shoulder injury against Arizona and was expected to be out for several weeks. Bowman redshirted on November 11 after being cleared to play again.\nIn the third game of the 2020 season Bowman left during the 1st quarter against Kansas State with an apparent leg injury; Bowman finished the game 4-of-7 for 23 yards. Bowman returned from injury and started the next game against no. 24 Iowa State. Bowman struggled in the game and was benched in favor of Utah State transfer Henry Colombi, who was later named the team's starter moving forward. On November 14 against Baylor, Bowman played one series that ended with him throwing a pick six. Bowman would enter the game again in the 3rd quarter after Colombi suffered an injury to his non-throwing arm; the Red Raiders were down 6–20 when Bowman entered. Bowman would lead Texas Tech back in the game, leading the team on three scoring drives in the second half that resulted in a 24–23 victory for the Red Raiders.\nMichigan.\nOn February 28, 2021, Bowman announced that he would be transferring to Michigan for the upcoming season. Prior to the 2021 season, redshirt sophomore Cade McNamara was named Michigan's starting quarterback, beating out Bowman and five-star freshman J. J. McCarthy. Bowman appeared in the team's game against Wisconsin, the fourth quarterback Michigan used in the game, throwing an interception.\nOklahoma State.\nOn January 9, 2023, Bowman transferred to Oklahoma State."

The competition was the third edition of the competition since its name change in 2016 and the sixth edition since it was launched as the Community Cup in 2013.\nSARU restored the competition to the early-year time-slot it occupied from 2013 to 2015 — which resulted the competition taking a hiatus in 2018 – and was scheduled for 9 March to 14 April 2019. In an additional change from the 2017 edition, the amount of participating teams were reduced from 20 to 16, with one spot going to each of the fourteen provincial unions, one spot to the sub-union and the final spot went to a wildcard entry.\nCompetition rules and information.\nThere were sixteen participating teams in the 2019 Gold Cup, divided into four pools of four teams. Each team played all the other teams in their pool during the pool stage, either at home or away. Teams received four log points for a win and two log points for a draw. Bonus log points were awarded to teams that scored four or more tries in a game, as well as to teams that lost a match by seven points or less. Teams were ranked by log points, then points difference (points scored less points conceded).\nThe top two teams in each pool after the pool stage qualified for the quarterfinals. The quarterfinal winners qualified to the semifinals, and the semifinal winners to the final.\nTeams.\nThe teams that qualified for the 2019 Gold Cup were confirmed by SARU on 14 November 2018. In addition to the fifteen teams that qualified from each provincial union, East Rand United were included as a wildcard team.

From late October 1937 to mid-February 1938 they played 15 first-class matches, including five against India, as well as nine other matches. Lord Tennyson's XI won the series against India 3–2.\nThe team.\nAs England had no Test tour during the 1937–38 season, Tennyson was able to select a strong team.\nAll the touring team except Jameson and McCorkell had played, or later played, Test cricket. Ages are at the start of the tour.\nThe manager was C. H. M. Barday. Alexander Hosie (47, formerly of Hampshire), who was living in India, played in one of the first-class matches.\nThe tour.\nFor much of the tour, injuries and illnesses prevented the team from fielding its best eleven. Tennyson, who turned 48 just after the tour began and weighed nearly 17 stone (that is, nearly 238 pounds), suffered a severe bout of dysentery early in the tour but returned to the team as soon as he could.\nAs well as the cricket and the constant travelling across India by train and around the coast by ship, the team were also treated to numerous banquets and were taken sight-seeing and game-shooting. Tennyson recalled that he made 157 speeches, each one as different from the others as he could contrive. The manager, C. H. M. Barday, thought it was the most popular team to have toured India so far, and singled out Tennyson, the diplomat \"par excellence\": \"No matter how tired or busy he was, the English captain never refused to sign an autograph, an example which all members of the side emulated, thereby adding greatly to their popularity.\""

        "text": "Fox Cricket is an Australian subscription television channel dedicated to screening cricket (both domestic and international) matches and related programming. It is owned by Fox Sports Pty Limited and is available throughout Australia on Foxtel. The channel was launched on 17 September 2018.\nHistory.\nSince its launch in 1995 as Premier Sports Network, Fox Sports has been broadcaster to most of Australian international tours despite lacking domestic Australian international rights which has been a mainstay at the Nine Network since 1979. The first major cricket event that was broadcast on PSN was Australia's tour of the West Indies in 1995 which was also the first on pay television in Australia. Nine who up to 1995 had broadcast on free-to-air had tried to keep off PTV under Australia's anti-siphoning rules, which rules that certain events cannot be screened exclusively on pay television. Ultimately a deal was signed with Network Ten to the broadcast series on FTA while also being on PTV with PSN. From 2005/06 to 2012/13 Fox Sports had exclusive rights to domestic cricket in Australia including most or all of the then Ford Ranger One-Day cup and KFC Big Bash T20 matches including the first 2 seasons of the Big Bash League along with the final of the Sheffield Shield, Fox also had highlights of international men's Test, ODI and T20 matches in Australia. In 2013, Fox Sports lost the rights of the BBL to Network Ten and the Ryobi One-Day Cup to the Nine Network for the next 5 years with international cricket in Australia remaining on Nine. Most overseas cricket broadcast stayed on Fox except for Ashes tours of England which Nine had exclusive rights to while the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup which was held in Australia was broadcast on Fox Sports along with Nine.\nIn April 2018, Fox Sports came to a six-year agreement with Cricket Australia that expanded their previous coverage of cricket on the Foxtel platform. This deal formed a part of Cricket Australia's six year overall coverage deal which also includes free to air coverage by Channel Seven.\nIn early May, Foxtel announced the upcoming creation of a dedicated channel, Fox Cricket, featuring the entire Australian Summer of international cricket from 2018 and 2019 including tests, one day matches and T20 matches as well as the Big Bash Leagues and World Cups. The channel debuted on 17 September 2018, with the 2018 Caribbean Premier League final being the first live match broadcast.\nProgramming.\nEvent coverage.\nSports programming on Fox Cricket includes the following:\nNews and analysis programming.\nFox Cricket will air several studio shows including the programs listed below:\nPersonnel.\nMedia outlets announced a number of key hosting and commentary personnel in the lead up to the 2018-19 cricket season.\nNetwork personalities and the media attended the launch for Fox Cricket on 9 October 2018.

        "text": "The 2018 FIA GT World Cup (formally the SJM Macau GT Cup – FIA GT World Cup) was a Grand Touring (GT) sports car race held on the Guia Circuit in the Chinese Special Administrative Region of Macau on 18 November. It was the event's fourth annual edition eleventh GT3 car race in Macau. Only platinum and gold drivers were allowed to compete, but silver drivers were eligible on a case by case basis at the FIA GT World Cup Committee's discretion. The Stéphane Ratel Organisation, in collaboration with the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), promoted the race. The event was made up of two races: a 12-lap qualifying race to set the 18-lap main race's starting grid.\nAugusto Farfus of BMW Team Schnitzer won the main race from pole position in a BMW M6 GT3. After winning the Qualification Race the afternoon before, Farfus led every lap of the main race to achieve his fourth Macau victory and his first since the 2009 Guia Race of Macau. BMW became the third manufacturer to win the race. Mercedes-AMG Team GruppeM Racing's Maro Engel finished second, and his teammate Edoardo Mortara finished third.\nBackground and entry list.\nThe 2018 FIA GT World Cup was confirmed at the FIA World Motor Sport Council meeting on March 9. The event was held in the Chinese Special Administrative Region of Macau thanks to a contract extension with race organisers. It was the race's fourth staging and the eleventh GT3 event in Macau, taking place on the Guia Circuit in the streets of Macau on November 18, 2018, after three days of practice and qualifying. The Stéphane Ratel Organisation (SRO) collaborated with the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) to promote the race; the SRO was appointed by the promoter Associação Geral Automóvel de Macau-China to form a field of cars. The manufacturers' championship was presented to the maker of the winning participant's car, in accordance with the event regulations. The FIA nominated tyre manufacturer Pirelli as the race's control tyre supplier for the fourth successive year.\nDrivers had to have competed in an FIA-regulated championship race based on GT3 regulations in the previous two seasons or have significant experience in Grand Touring (GT) cars to enter the race. Only those with a platinum or gold racing licence could automatically enter. Silver-ranked drivers were also permitted, but they had to be approved individually by the FIA GT World Cup Committee. Bronze-rated competitors were not permitted to compete. Entries were open from 6 July to 31 August. The FIA released the entry list on 18 October. The entry list included 15 drivers from 11 different countries, and they came from series such as the ADAC GT Masters and the Blancpain GT Series. Maro Engel, Laurens Vanthoor and Edoardo Mortara, as well as 2007 Macau Grand Prix winner Oliver Jarvis, were all former FIA GT World Cup winners.\nThe FIA imposed a balance of performance to ensure a high level of parity. The Audi R8 LMS had of ballast added. Meanwhile, the weight of the BMW M6 GT3 was decreased by but the turbocharger boost was reduced. The Mercedes-AMG GT3 gained handling with a reduction in ballast but lost performance due to a reduction in air restrictor size. The Nissan GT-R Nismo GT3 debuted in Macau, weighing , while the Porsche 911 GT3 R received no performance changes.\nPractice.\nThere were two half-an-hour practice sessions preceding the 18 November race. Robin Frijns's 66 Team WRT Speedstar Audi R8 LMS lapped fastest in the first practice session on the afternoon of 15 November at 2 minutes, 18.588 seconds, ahead of Mortara, Christopher Haase, Augusto Farfus and Earl Bamber. Four manufacturers were represented in the first five. The session was stopped for separate accidents at the Melco hairpin. Dries Vanthoor, Frijns' teammate, hit the outside wall and lost control, coming to a stop sideways across the circuit. His car's front-left bodywork was damaged, and the spoiler was removed. While attempting to avoid Dries Vanthoor, Mathieu Jaminet was unsighted and crashed into a wall, sustaining minor damage to his car's left door. Farfus was forced to stop after that. Four manufacturers occupied the first five positions in the second practice session on the morning of November 16th, with Bamber setting the fastest lap in the No. 912 Manthey Racing Porsche 911 GT3 R at 2 minutes, 17.436 seconds with three minutes remaining after adjustments and tyre changes. Second through fifth were Engel, Frijns, Laurens Vanthoor, and Farfus. When Haase lost control of his vehicle and collided with the barrier at the R Bend turn, the session ended prematurely.\nQualifying.\nFriday afternoon's half-hour qualifying session determined the qualification race's starting order through each driver's fastest lap times. Conditions were cool for qualifying. Raffaele Marciello's No. 999 GruppeM Racing Mercedes-AMG GT3 took pole position in his second race in Macau, as the only driver to go under 2 minutes, 17 seconds on his final timed lap at 2 minutes, 16.8 seconds time on his final timed lap. It was his second pole position in Macau since the 2013 Macau Grand Prix. Marciello demoted Farfus from pole to second, despite the latter lapping faster with two minutes remaining. Following late-session improvements and a battle between both drivers, Engel took third and Mortara was fourth, giving Mercedes three positions in the top four. Manthey's Bamber and Laurens Vanthoor were fifth and sixth, with Audi drivers Frijns, Haase, and Dries Vanthoor seventh through ninth. Jaminet qualified tenth. Alexandre Imperatori took 11th, followed by Adderly Fong and Darryl O'Young from Hong Kong in 12th and 13th. Jarvis qualified 14th in his first Macau race since winning the 2007 Macau Grand Prix and Tsugio Matsuda in 15th completed the starting order. Frijns outbraked himself at Lisboa corner and crashed into the barrier during qualifying, necessitating the use of a localised yellow flag with less than three minutes remaining.\nPost-qualifying.\nThe FIA changed the performance balance again before the qualifying race, reducing the minimum ballast of the three KCMG-fielded Nissan GT-R Nismo GT3s by for better handling. The vehicles' performance was also improved, with turbocharger boost increases across the board. O'Young started from the back of the field after changing engines after qualifying. \nQualifying race.\nThe qualifying race to determine the main race's starting order began at 13:05 Macau Standard Time () on November 17 under overcast conditions of . Matsuda failed to start because smoke billowed from the front of his car as the formation lap began. Farfus had a better start than Marciello and took the lead on the outside into Mandarin Bend corner. The safety car was dispatched almost immediately for a three-car collision. Laurens Vanthoor and Mortara collided as Mortara was defending from Vanthoor and Bamber on both sides into Mandarin Bend turn. Mortara swerved to the right as Bamber did the same, colliding with Laurens Vanthoor. Vanthoor went into a half-spin, crashing sideways into the outside barrier and rolling back across the circuit. He was unhurt. Two laps were completed under safety car conditions to allow Laurens Vanthoor's car to be removed from the track before it was withdrawn for the third lap restart. \nFarfus took longer than usual to resume racing speeds after steering his car from side to side on the back straight before the final turn. By the end of the third lap, he had a second's advantage over Marciello after a clean start., subsequently extendinb it to 2 seconds. Marciello set the race's fastest lap of 2 minutes, 17.989 seconds on lap seven to briefly threaten a comeback, but Farfus quickly responded by lapping four-tenths of a second faster on lap eight and then by seven-tenths of a second faster on lap nine, resetting the fastest lap to 2 minutes, 17.987 seconds. Farfus could then gradually extend his lead, even though Marciello and his teammate Engel were faster in the track's mountain section. He won the 12-lap qualifying race, claiming pole position for the main race by 3.812 seconds over Marciello. The final classified finishers were Engel, Mortara, Bamber, Frijns, Haase, Dries Vanthoor, Jaminet, Imperatori, Fong, Jarvis and O'Young.\nMain race.\nOn November 18, at 12:25 p.m. local time, the race began in overcast conditions. Laurens Vanthoor was forced to withdraw from the rest of the event due to chassis damage sustained in his first lap accident with Mortara in the previous day's qualification race, resulting in his second consecutive weekend-ending crash. Farfus made a quick start from pole position and steered to the inside to maintain the lead over Marciello entering the first turn. As Farfus entered Lisboa corner, Maricello applied pressure, but he was unable to overtake him and remained second. Behind Farfus and Maricello, Mortara and his teammate Engel were third and fourth with Bamber fifth. Bamber collided with the barrier at the Solitude Esses on the second lap but continued without damaging his vehicle. Farfus had opened up a more than one-second lead over Marciello by the lap's conclusion. Following the first four laps, Marciello drew close to Farfus and was able to put pressure on the race leader by closely following him. Marciello was able to lap faster in the circuit's mountain areas, but he failed to close up enough to Farfus to attempt a pass. Marciello hit the barrier while attempting to turn into Lisboa turn on the eighth lap after braking late for the turn. He returned to the track without necessitating the yellow flags and dropped to tenth. The accident promoted Engel to second, behind Farfus. \nTo distract Farfus, Engel frequently used light flashing. Throughout most of the rest of the race, he stayed within a second of Farfus, who countered with his BMW's higher straightline speed over Engel's Mercedes-Benz. Matsuda passed O'Young for 13th on lap 11, while Marciello passed Imperatori for ninth and Jaminet passed Dries Vanthoor for seventh on the following lap. With two laps remaining, Engel made a braking error for the Melco hairpin, increasing Farfus' lead. Farfus eventually led all 18 laps to achieve his first Macau victory since the 2009 Guia Race of Macau, his fourth in Macau, and his first GT victory on the Guia Circuit. BMW became the third manufacturer to win the FIA GT World Cup. Engel followed 0.981 seconds later in second. His teammate Mortara, whose car lacked downforce and pace, finished third after overcoming an early race error at Police bend. Bamber in fourth was the final car in the lead pack. Frijns was the highest-placed Audi driver, finishing fifth, giving four manufacturers a presence in the top five. Frijns finished two seconds ahead of Haase, who was sixth. Jaminet and Dries Vanthoor finished seventh and eighth, respectively, with Marciello ninth. Imperatori was the highest-finishing Nissan driver, finishing tenth. The final four finishers were Fong, Jarvis, Matuda, and O'Young. During a race with no safety car deployments, only three overtakes happened."

Assistant coach Geno Ford was named interim head coach of the team in the College Basketball Invitational tournament.\nPrevious season.\nThe Seawolves finished the 2017–18 season 13–19, 7–9 in the America East Conference play to finish in fifth place. In the America East tournament, they upset Albany on the road before losing to Vermont in the semifinals. Freshman Elijah Olaniyi was named America East Rookie of the Year, while sophomore Akwasi Yeboah was named All-America East Second Team.\nSeason.\nIn their season opener at George Washington, Stony Brook fell behind 22–0 but rallied all the way back to force overtime and win, 77–74 in one of the largest comebacks in NCAA Division I history. The Seawolves then upset South Carolina to win their first game against an SEC opponent in program history. Stony Brook started 6–1 for the first time as a Division I program. Stony Brook won 12 non-conference games, a new school record as a Division I program. The team's seven true road wins led the nation.\nIn the America East regular season, the Seawolves began 5–0 in conference play, including a comeback against Maine that came after an 18–point deficit. They lost control of first place in the America East after a 72–53 defeat against Vermont at home. The conference regular-season title was on the line in Stony Brook's second matchup at Vermont in March, and after falling down by 13, a 20–2 Stony Brook run gave them the lead only to fall by a final score of 50–56. A 68–63 road victory at Hartford secured the No. 2 seed in the America East tournament for Stony Brook; a loss would have dropped them to fourth place.\nIn the quarterfinals of the America East tournament, Stony Brook played seventh-seeded Binghamton. In a stunning upset, the Seawolves fell down by 24 points in the second half but would have cut the deficit to one after a Jaron Cornish layup and foul. However, the call was reversed to an offensive foul, sending the deficit back to four and sending Stony Brook home in an improbable loss.\nThe Seawolves were invited to the 2019 College Basketball Invitational, where they travelled to Tampa to play South Florida. Although Stony Brook had a 25-point lead in the first half (48–23), they collapsed down the stretch and ultimately lost, 82–79, in overtime.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#; color:white;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#; color:white;\"| America East regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| America East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=| College Basketball Invitational\nSource"

        "text": "The 2019 Road to the Kentucky Derby was a series of races through which horses qualified for the 2019 Kentucky Derby, which was held on May 4, 2019. The field for the Derby is limited to 20 horses, with up to four 'also eligibles' in case of a late withdrawal from the field. There are three separate paths for horses to take to qualify for the Derby: the main Road consisting of races in North America (plus one in Dubai), the Japan Road consisting of four races in Japan, and a European Road consisting of seven races in England, Ireland and France.\nThe main Road to the Kentucky Derby gives points to the top four finishers in specified races. The 2019 season was supposed to remain the same as the 2018 Road to the Kentucky Derby, consisting of 35 races broken down into 19 races for the Kentucky Derby Prep Season and 16 races for the Kentucky Derby Championship Season. Earnings in non-restricted stakes act as a tie breaker. However, the San Felipe Stakes was not run in 2019 due to difficulties with the track surface at Santa Anita Park in the wake of heavy winter rains, while the Rebel Stakes was run in two divisions with the posts adjusted to 37.5-15-7.5-3.75 for each division.\nFor 2019, some small changes were made from 2018 for the other series:\nMain Road to the Kentucky Derby.\nStandings.\nThe following table shows the points earned in the eligible races for the main series. Entries for the 2019 Kentucky Derby were taken on April 30. Omaha Beach was originally entered but was scratched on May 1 due to an entrapped epiglottis. Haikal subsequently scratched as well. As a result, Bodexpress drew into the race.\nCountry House, who qualified by finishing second in the Risen Star and third in the Arkansas Derby, was declared the winner after Maximum Security was disqualified for interference.\nPrep season results.\n\"Note: 1st=10 points; 2nd=4 points; 3rd=2 points; 4th=1 point (except the Breeders' Cup Juvenile: 1st=20 points; 2nd=8 points; 3rd=4 points; 4th=2 point)\"\nChampionship series results.\nFirst leg of series.\n\"Note: 1st=50 points; 2nd=20 points; 3rd=10 points; 4th=5 points except for the Rebel Stakes\"\n\"Rebel Stakes (both divisions) 1st=37.5 points; 2nd=15 points; 3rd=7.5 points; 4th=3.75 points\"\nSecond leg of series.\nThese races are the major preps for the Kentucky Derby, and are thus weighted more heavily.\n\"Note: 1st=100 points; 2nd=40 points; 3rd=20 points; 4th=10 points\"\n\"Wild Card\" events.\n\"Note: 1st=20 points; 2nd=8 points; 3rd=4 points; 4th=2 points\"\nJapan Road to the Kentucky Derby.\nThe Japan Road to the Kentucky Derby is intended to provide a place in the Derby starting gate to the top finisher in the series. If the connections of that horse decline the invitation, their place is offered to the second-place finisher and so on through the top four finishers. If none of the top four accept, this place in the starting gate reverts to the horses on the main road to the Derby.\nIn 2019, the top three finishers in the Japan Road declined the invitation as they had not been nominated to the Derby. The connections of the fourth-place finisher, Master Fencer, decided to accept the offer, marking the first time that a Japanese-bred horse will enter the Derby.\nQualification table.\nThe top four horses (colored brown within the standings) are eligible to participate in the Kentucky Derby provided the horse is nominated.\n\"Notes:\" \nEvents.\n\"Notes:\" \n\"Cattleya Sho: 1st=10 points; 2nd=4 points; 3rd=2 points; 4th=1 point\"\n\"Zen-Nippon Nisai Yushun: 1st=20 points; 2nd=8 points; 3rd=4 points; 4th=2 points\"\n\"Hyacinth: 1st=30 points; 2nd=12 points; 3rd=6 points; 4th=3 points\"\n\"Fukuryu : 1st=40 points; 2nd=16 points; 3rd=8 points; 4th=4 points\"\nEuropean Road to the Kentucky Derby.\nThe European Road to the Kentucky Derby is designed on a similar basis to the Japan Road and is intended to provide a place in the Derby starting gate to the top finisher in the series. If the connections of that horse decline the invitation, their place is offered to the second-place finisher and so on. If none of the top four accept, this place in the starting gate reverts to the horses on the main road to the Derby.\nThe series consists of seven races – four run on the turf in late 2018 when the horses are age two, plus three races run on a synthetic surface in early 2018.\nQualification Table.\nThe top four horses (colored brown within the standings) were eligible to participate in the Kentucky Derby provided the horse is nominated. However, none of the connections accepted the invitation, so this position in the starting gate reverted to horses on the main Road.\nEvents.\n\"Note:\""

The team represents the basketball men's section of CSM Târgu Mureș, a multi-sports club, founded in 2017 by the decision of the local council of Târgu Mureș, in order to reinvigorate the sport from the city, which was in crisis at that time. The basketball men's section was born in the summer of 2018, following the dissolution of BC Mureș in March.\nHistory.\nThe merger between the Liga Națională (the top tier of Romanian basketball) and Liga I (the second tier) after the 2017-18 season meant that CSM Târgu Mureș was going to start its existence directly in the top flight. A lot of the players that were playing with BC Mureș the previous season joined the club, while George Trif was appointed head coach. CSM Târgu Mureș finished the 2018-19 season in eleventh, way clear of the relegation zone, but financial difficulties within the club meant that they chose to withdraw from the Liga Națională for the 2019-20 season and enter the second tier. While the financial irregularities were resolved in December 2021, the team had a dominant 2021-22 season on the court, losing only once all season in order to be promoted back to the top tier. \"Mureșenii\" had a difficult start to the new campaign, which included five losses in six games in November, ultimately failing to qualify for the Championship round. A string of wins during the later stages of the campaign meant that CSM finished the 2022-23 season in eleventh once again."

        "text": "The Bray boxing club shooting happened in Bray, Ireland on 5 June 2018. Three men were shot, one died. One of the survivors was Pete Taylor, father of Katie Taylor.\nShooting.\nAt 6:55am a man walked into the Bray Boxing Club just before a class started and fired a number of shots, killing Bobby Messett, injuring Pete Taylor in the arm and chest and Ian Britton in the legs. There were 12 people in the gym including 1 minor at the time of the shooting. Katie Taylor had previously trained in the club, but was no longer involved and was in the United States at the time.\nPete Taylor and the other survivor of the shooting were taken to St. Vincent's University Hospital after being shot.\nGardai were looking for a silver coloured Volkswagen Caddy after examining CCTV. The van was thought to have travelled from Bray through Shankill, then abandoned on Pigeon House Road near Poolbeg Generating Station in Ringsend.\nArrests and charges.\nGerard Cervi, of no fixed abode, was arrested and charged at a special sitting of Bray District Court in September 2018. The 31-year-old was originally from East Wall.\nA woman in her 20s was arrested in relation to the case, but released without charge.\nCervi was also charged with the attempted murders of Peter Taylor and Ian Britton in January 2019. He was sent for trial in February 2019.\nAftermath.\nPete Taylor spoke of his distress in the aftermath of the shooting both at the event and at the death of his close friend Bobby Messett, who had joined the gym in 2010. Petes' partner Karen Brown said on Instagram that she and Pete were relocating abroad after a \"turbulent summer\".\nTrials.\nFirst trial.\nOn 28 June 2021 Gerard Cervi appeared at the Central Criminal Court. He spoke only to confirm his name and to plead not guilty to the charge of murdering Bobby Messett on 18 June 2018 and to the charges of attempting to murder Pete Taylor and Ian Britton on the same date. The trial was due to start on 29 June 2021 before Mr Justice Michael White.\nThe trial began on the afternoon of 29 June 2021. The prosecution stated that their case was that a single gunman had opened fire in the club and that the accused was said gunman. Furthermore, there were twelve people in the club and the three charges against him. Motive did not have to be decided.\nIn September the trial collapsed. The trial was originally due to end in August, but the finish date was extended to September and two jurors asked to be discharged. The remaining jurors agreed on 24 August to continue sitting until 22 October. On 2 September nine members of the jury arrived in court and Mr Justice White said he was \"sorry to hear about the illness to one of your number\". He said he hoped she would recover and adjourned the trial until 6 September. On 6 September he said that the ill juror had to go back into hospital and although her illness was not life-threatening it was impossible for the trial to continue as they had fewer than ten jurors. He thanked the nine for their jury service and discharged them. He listed the case for mention before the Central Criminal Court on 11 October 2021.\nRetrial.\nIn May 2023 the date of the retrial was set for 2 October 2023.\nThe trial began on 4 October 2023. Gerard Cervi pleaded not guilty. The state argued that fingerprint and DNA evidence taken from the van allegedly used by the gunman linked it to Gerard Cervi.\nPete Taylor gave evidence on 11 October 2023. He said that he had put on some music, heard loud bangs and thought an air compressor had blown up. He said that he saw Cervi standing in the door frame, with his feet apart, shooting. Taylor could not find anything to throw at the gunman, so ran towards him. He said he ran around machines, tripped over a bench and was shot in the shoulder as he was going over the bench.\nVerdict.\nOn 24 November 2023 Gerard Cervi was found guilty of the murder of Bobby Messett but was acquitted of attempting to murder Pete Taylor or Ian Britton.\nSentence.\nOn 1 December 2023 Gerard Cervi was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Bobby Messett."

The 115th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League champion Houston Astros and the National League champion Washington Nationals. The series was played from October 22 to October 30. Washington upset the favored Astros, four games to three, to secure its first title in franchise history and first in the capital city since the 1924 series. Washington pitcher Stephen Strasburg was named the World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) after earning two wins in the series.\nThe Astros had home-field advantage because they had the better regular-season record. It was the third World Series in which home-field advantage was decided by the regular-season records of the American and National league champions, a practice that started in the 2017 season. It was the first World Series in which the Houston Astros had home-field advantage. The series was played in a 2–3–2 format, with the Astros hosting Games 1, 2, 6, and 7; and the Nationals hosting Games 3, 4, and 5.\nFor the first time in any of the major North American sports leagues, the visiting team won all the games of a seven-game championship series, surpassing the previous high of five. The road team outscored the home team 49–14 in the seven games played. Washington won despite scoring only three runs at home. It was the sixth straight World Series in which the championship was clinched by the visiting team.\nWith the Nationals being from the National League East, this marked the sixth World Series in a row to have been won by teams from separate divisions in Major League Baseball.\nFor the third straight year, MLB sold presenting sponsorships to all of postseason series. As with the 2017 and 2018 World Series, this World Series was sponsored by YouTube TV and was officially known as the \"2019 World Series presented by YouTube TV\".\nBackground.\nThis was the first World Series appearance for the franchise that began its existence as the Montreal Expos in 1969, and moved to Washington, D.C. in 2005 to become the Nationals. The Nationals were also the last team from the 1969 expansion class (which also included the Kansas City Royals, Milwaukee Brewers—who began as the Seattle Pilots—and San Diego Padres) to earn a trip to the series. Also, after their World Series appearance, all National League (NL) teams had played in at least one World Series. The only American League (AL) team that has yet to play in a World Series is the Seattle Mariners, who were part of the 1977 expansion. Prior to this series, the Astros and Nationals had never played each other in a postseason series, even though Houston played in the NL from 1962 to 2012 before moving to the AL West in 2013. In fact, the Nationals are the only team the Astros have faced in the World Series that they have never faced in a pre-World Series playoff round, since the Astros have faced the White Sox, Dodgers, and Braves during at least one playoff round prior to the World Series. The Astros and Nationals did not play an interleague game in 2019, and last faced each other during the 2017 regular season. The two teams share a spring training site in West Palm Beach, Florida, and opened the 2019 spring training schedule against each other. This was the second World Series to feature two expansion teams, the first being in between the Kansas City Royals and the New York Mets. The Astros were deemed as heavy favorites to win the title.\nWashington Nationals.\nThe Nationals finished the 2018 season with an 82–80 () win–loss record, and started the 2019 season with a 19–31 () record. Second-year manager Dave Martinez began to receive public pressure to be fired by the Nationals. The team engineered a turnaround and finished the season in second place in the National League East, four games behind the Atlanta Braves, ending the year with a 93–69 () record. The Nationals were one of two teams to qualify for the playoffs as a wild card team from the National League. Martinez had missed three games in September for a cardiac catheterization procedure to treat angina.\nThe fourth-seeded Nationals defeated the Milwaukee Brewers at home in the National League Wild Card Game, coming behind from a 3–1 deficit in the eighth inning to win 4–3. The Nationals then upset the top-seeded Los Angeles Dodgers, who had won the previous two National League pennants, in the National League Division Series. The Nationals were behind two games to one, and won their second and third elimination games of the postseason to take the best-of-five series. The postseason series win was the first in Washington Nationals history. In the best-of-seven National League Championship Series, the Nationals swept the St. Louis Cardinals (who had defeated the Braves in the Division Series round) in four games to secure the first pennant in franchise history (including their time as the Montreal Expos from 1969 to 2004). It was the first World Series appearance for a team from Washington D.C. since , including 33 seasons that the city did not host an MLB team (1972–2004).\nHouston Astros.\nIn the prior two seasons, the Astros had won the 2017 World Series, the franchise's first World Series championship, and lost the 2018 American League Championship Series to the Boston Red Sox. The Astros finished the 2019 regular season atop the American League West—their third consecutive division championship—with a 107–55 () win–loss record. Their 107 wins were a franchise record, and the most in MLB for the season.\nThe Astros entered the postseason as the overall #1 seed. Their first opponent in the postseason was determined by the American League Wild Card Game, which saw the Tampa Bay Rays defeat the Oakland Athletics. In the best-of-five American League Division Series, the top-seeded Astros defeated fifth-seeded Tampa Bay in five games, with each game of the series being won by the home team. The Astros' opponent in the best-of-seven American League Championship Series (ALCS) was the second-seeded New York Yankees, who had defeated the Minnesota Twins in their playoff series, three games to none. In the ALCS, the Astros and Yankee split the first two games, followed by the Astros winning two-of-three games played at Yankee Stadium. Game 6 in Houston was then won by the Astros, giving them the series win, four games to two. The Astros' ALCS victory advanced them to their third overall World Series appearance (2 in the American League &amp; one in the National League), and second in three years.\nGame summaries.\nThe below game summaries include a line score of each game, showing the runs scored by each team during each inning. Various baseball terms appearing in the summaries can be found in the glossary of baseball terms. The performance of pitchers in a game is often summarized by wording such as \"two runs on three hits while striking out four batters\", indicating how many runs and hits the pitcher allowed (the fewer, the better) and how many opposing batters the pitcher struck out (the more, the better).\nGame 1.\nBefore the national anthem sung by Nicole Scherzinger, a moment of silence took place in honor of umpire Eric Cooper, who had died on October 20. Former Astro Brian McCann threw out the ceremonial first pitch to former teammate Evan Gattis. Max Scherzer started for the Nationals, while Gerrit Cole started for the Astros. With two outs in the bottom of the first inning, Yuli Gurriel hit a two-run double, giving the Astros a 2–0 lead. In the top of the second inning, Ryan Zimmerman hit a home run to cut the Astros' lead to 2–1. Juan Soto led off the top of the fourth inning with a home run to tie the game, 2–2. Soto became the fourth-youngest player to hit a home run in a World Series; Andruw Jones in 1996 was the youngest to date. Adam Eaton batted in a run in the top of the fifth inning, followed two batters later by a Soto two-run double, giving the Nationals a 5–2 lead.\nScherzer exited after pitching five innings, having allowed two runs on five hits while striking out seven batters. Cole went seven innings, allowing five runs on eight hits while striking out six. After Nationals pitcher Patrick Corbin pitched a scoreless sixth, George Springer led off the bottom of the seventh inning with the 14th postseason home run of his career, off Nats relief pitcher Tanner Rainey. He also broke a World Series record held by Reggie Jackson and Lou Gehrig, with a home run in five consecutive World Series games, dating back to Game4 of the 2017 World Series. The Astros loaded the bases later in the inning with two walks off Rainey and an infield single off Daniel Hudson, but Hudson struck out Yordan Álvarez to prevent any more scoring. In the bottom of the eighth inning, pinch hitter Kyle Tucker singled, advanced to second on a fly ball by Aledmys Díaz, and Springer batted in another run with a double, pulling the Astros to within one run, 5–4. Sean Doolittle, the Nationals' fifth pitcher of the game, got the final out of the eighth inning and retired the side in order in the bottom of the ninth, concluding matters when Carlos Correa lined out to Víctor Robles to preserve the win. Doolittle earned his second save of the postseason and the underdogs took the series lead, marking the first time in franchise history that the Nationals won a World Series game.\nGame 2.\nGymnast and Houston native Simone Biles threw out the ceremonial first pitch of Game2. The starting pitchers were Stephen Strasburg for the Nationals and Justin Verlander for the Astros. After a walk and a single to start the game, Anthony Rendon batted in two runs with a double. Alex Bregman tied the game with a two-run home run in the bottom of the first. In the top of the second inning, Verlander recorded the 200th postseason strikeout of his career, surpassing John Smoltz (whose career spanned 1988–2009) and setting a new MLB record.\nLeading off the top of the seventh, Kurt Suzuki hit a home run to put the Nationals ahead, 3–2. Verlander exited one batter later; he was charged with four runs on seven hits while striking out six batters, and was later assessed the loss. Washington scored five more runs in the seventh off Ryan Pressly, extending their lead to 8–2. With a six-run lead, Strasburg was removed before the bottom of the seventh, having held the Astros to two runs on seven hits while striking out seven. In the eighth inning, a two-run home run by Adam Eaton plus a run batted in (RBI) by Asdrúbal Cabrera extended the Nationals' lead to nine runs. A ninth-inning home run by Michael A. Taylor off Chris Devenski pushed the lead to 12–2. Astro Martín Maldonado hit a home run in the bottom of the ninth off relief pitcher Javy Guerra, but there was no further scoring as the Nationals completed their eighth consecutive playoff win.\nGame 3.\nThis was the first World Series game played in Washington D.C. since October 7, 1933, which was the clinching Game5 of the New York Giants' win over the Washington Senators. Chad Cordero of the 2005 Nationals threw out the ceremonial first pitch to former teammate Brian Schneider; former astronaut Buzz Aldrin also threw a ceremonial pitch. Aníbal Sánchez started for the Nationals, while Zack Greinke started for the Astros. In the second inning, Josh Reddick batted in Carlos Correa as Houston scored the game's first run. In the third inning, José Altuve doubled and advanced to third on an error, then scored on an infield single by Michael Brantley, giving the Astros a 2–0 lead. The Nationals loaded the bases with two outs in the bottom of the third, but were unable to score. In the bottom of the fourth, Ryan Zimmerman walked then was driven in by a triple by Víctor Robles, cutting the Astros' lead to 2–1.\nHouston restored its two-run lead in the top of the fifth, as Altuve doubled and was then batted in by Brantley. Greinke left with two outs in the bottom of the fifth, having allowed one run on seven hits while striking out six batters. The Astros extended their lead to 4–1 in the top of the sixth, as Robinson Chirinos hit a home run off the left field foul pole netting. Sánchez lasted until one out in the top of the sixth, having allowed four runs on 10 hits while striking out four. With no additional scoring through the middle of the ninth, the Astros brought in closer Roberto Osuna to pitch the bottom of the ninth. Osuna allowed a one-out single to Adam Eaton, but otherwise retired the Nationals; Juan Soto struck out looking to end the Nationals’ eight-game playoff winning streak. Osuna earned his second save this postseason, as Houston narrowed Washington's lead in the series to 2–1. This became the first World Series to begin with three games won by the road team since 1996, when the first five games were won by the road team.\nGame 4.\nThe ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by a Nationals Youth Baseball Academy scholar-athlete. Patrick Corbin started for the Nationals and José Urquidy started for the Astros. The Astros scored early, recording two runs in the first inning on four consecutive singles with one out. Robinson Chirinos hit a two-run home run in the fourth inning, extending Houston's lead to 4–0. Urquidy exited after five innings, having held the Nationals scoreless, retiring nine straight batters before being removed.\nWashington scored a run in the bottom of the sixth, coming on a Juan Soto ground out with the bases loaded and one out. Corbin pitched six innings, allowing four runs on seven hits while striking out five. A grand slam by Alex Bregman in the seventh inning extended Houston's lead to 8–1. It was the 20th ever World Series grand slam and first since Addison Russell hit one in Game6 of the 2016 World Series. With no further scoring, the Astros evened the series, 2–2, ensuring a sixth game in Houston. This was the fifth time a World Series started with the road team winning the first four games, the most recent occurrence having been 1996.\nGame 5.\nThe ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by chef José Andrés. The starting pitchers were Gerrit Cole for Houston and Joe Ross for Washington. Max Scherzer was scheduled to start for Washington, but was scratched about three hours before the game for neck spasms.\nA two-run home run by Yordan Álvarez in the top of the second inning gave the Astros an early lead. In the top of the fourth, Carlos Correa hit another two-run home run, extending Houston's lead to 4–0. Ross pitched for five innings, allowing four runs on five hits while striking out one batter. Juan Soto narrowed the lead to 4–1 with a home run in the bottom of the seventh. Yuli Gurriel batted in a run in the top of the eighth to restore the four-run lead. Cole left after seven innings, having held the Nationals to one run on three hits while striking out nine. George Springer's two-run home run in the top of the ninth stretched Houston's lead to 7–1. With Ryan Pressly ending the game by allowing no baserunners in the bottom of the ninth, the Astros moved to within a victory of their second title in three years. This became the third World Series—along with and —to have the road team win the first five games.\nHome plate umpire Lance Barksdale's strike zone during the game drew attention, with some sports journalists, including Jeff Passan, increasing their appeals to MLB for a computerized strike zone. Two women in the crowd flashed their bare chests during the game—briefly visible on television—in an attempt to raise awareness for their website, claiming proceeds from the site \"will be going to women with breast cancer\". Along with a third woman, they were removed from the game and were banned from all MLB stadiums \"indefinitely\". U.S. President Donald Trump was booed and \"chants of 'Lock him up!' broke out in some sections\" when he and wife Melania were introduced after the third inning during the regular serviceperson recognition segment. This led to some discussion in the media of the civility required of the event and the larger political discourse taking place. This was not the first time at a World Series that a President was booed; at the 1931 World Series, taking place during Prohibition, fans in Philadelphia had chanted at Herbert Hoover, \"We want beer! We want beer!\"\nGame 6.\nThe ceremonial first pitch was thrown by Hakeem Olajuwon to Clyde Drexler, both of whom played college basketball for the Houston Cougars and later won the 1995 NBA Finals with the Houston Rockets. Starting pitchers were Justin Verlander for Houston and Stephen Strasburg for Washington, the same as in Game2.\nAnthony Rendon batted in a run in the top of the first, giving the Nationals an early 1–0 lead. A sacrifice fly by José Altuve and a home run by Alex Bregman in the bottom of the first gave Houston a 2–1 lead. Bregman carried his bat to first base after homering, which some media members considered disrespectful. Fifth-inning home runs by Adam Eaton and Juan Soto gave the Nationals a 3–2 lead. Soto also carried his bat to first base after homering, mimicking Bregman. Post-game, both managers voiced displeasure with the bat-carrying; Bregman apologized and said he was at fault.\nVerlander exited after five innings, having allowed three runs on five hits while striking out three batters. In the top of the seventh inning, Trea Turner was controversially called out for interference on a play at first base, which Washington manager Dave Martinez furiously took issue with, leading to his ejection. Later that inning, a two-out, two-run home run by Rendon off Will Harris—who had not allowed an earned run in the postseason—increased Washington's lead to 5–2. Rendon batted in two more runs in the top of the ninth with a double off Chris Devenski, extending the Nationals' lead to 7–2. Strasburg left with one out in the bottom of the ninth, having held the Astros to two runs on five hits while striking out seven. Sean Doolittle relieved Strasburg, and allowed a two-out double to Carlos Correa, but nothing further, and the Nationals evened the series to force a deciding seventh game. This was the first instance in MLB, NBA, or NHL history when the road team won the first six games of a best-of-seven series.\nInterference call and Martinez ejection.\nIn the top of the seventh inning, the Nationals had a 3–2 lead with a runner, Yan Gomes, on first base with no outs when batter Trea Turner hit a swinging bunt to the third base side of the pitcher's mound. Astros pitcher Brad Peacock fielded the ball and threw it to first base; the ball was not caught by first baseman Yuli Gurriel and rolled into foul territory beyond the base, apparently giving the Nationals runners on second and third with no outs. However, Turner was called out by home plate umpire Sam Holbrook for interference, negating the play and requiring Gomes to return to first base. While initial reports and television commentary indicated the call was for running outside the runner's lane, MLB's chief baseball officer, Joe Torre, clarified after the game that Turner had interfered with Gurriel's attempt to catch the ball, stating that Turner \"did run to the fair side of the 45-foot line, but really the violation was when he kept Gurriel from being able to catch the ball at first base.\" The call led to a delay of nearly minutes while umpires confirmed their interpretation of the rules (the decision itself was a judgment call not reviewable via MLB instant replay). The call was argued by Nationals manager Dave Martinez when it was first made and again, more intensely, during the seventh-inning stretch, resulting in his ejection by Holbrook. It was the first ejection in a World Series since , when Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox had been ejected.\nGame 7.\nThis was the 40th time a World Series reached its deciding Game 7. The starting pitchers were Washington's Max Scherzer, who won Game1, and Houston's Zack Greinke, who received a no decision in Game3, making this the first World Series Game7 started by two previous Cy Young Award winners. Ceremonial first pitches were thrown by former Astros Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio.\nA home run by Yuli Gurriel in the bottom of the second inning gave the Astros an early 1–0 lead. Carlos Correa hit a two-out RBI single in the bottom of the fifth inning to extend the lead to 2–0. Scherzer pitched five innings, allowing two runs on seven hits while striking out three batters. Greinke had given up only one hit (a single) before Anthony Rendon's home run in the top of the seventh cut the Astros' lead to 2–1. Greinke walked Soto after Rendon's homer and was then replaced by Will Harris. Harris gave up a two-run home run to Howie Kendrick off the right field foul pole, giving the Nationals a 3–2 lead, which they never relinquished. Greinke was charged with two runs on two hits while striking out three in innings. Roberto Osuna pitched the eighth inning for Houston, when Juan Soto batted in Adam Eaton with two outs to give Washington a two-run lead. The Nationals extended their lead to 6–2 in the ninth inning, with two runs scoring on a one-out single by Eaton with the bases loaded. With Patrick Corbin having pitched three scoreless innings in relief for Washington, Daniel Hudson came in to pitch the bottom of the ninth and retired the side in order, as Michael Brantley struck out swinging to end the game, series, and baseball season, giving the Nationals franchise its first World Series title in 51 seasons, and the city's first since the Senators won in .\nThe Nationals' win marked the sixth straight year that a team clinched the World Series title via a win on the road, including four times that a Game7 was won by the visiting team. For the first time in major North American sports history, the visiting team won all seven games of a best-of-seven postseason series. In championship series of the NBA, NHL, and MLB contested during 2019, road teams compiled an overall 17–3 record. Additionally, the Nationals became the first team to win the World Series in their first appearance since 2002, when the Anaheim Angels accomplished the feat by defeating the San Francisco Giants in seven games. During postgame ceremonies, Washington's Stephen Strasburg was presented with the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, the first time a former No. 1 overall draft pick earned the award, and the first time a pitcher had won the award since Madison Bumgarner had won in 2014.\nSeries statistics.\n2019 World Series (4–3): Washington Nationals (NL) defeated Houston Astros (AL).\nThe Nationals wore their alternate blue jerseys for all seven games.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nThe World Series was televised by Fox for the 20th straight year. Joe Buck called the games as play-by-play announcer along with John Smoltz as color commentator and Ken Rosenthal and Tom Verducci as field reporters. Kevin Burkhardt hosted the network's pregame shows, joined by analysts Frank Thomas, Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz. Fox Deportes aired the series in Spanish, with Rolando Nichols calling the play-by-play, Edgar Gonzalez as color commentator, and Carlos Álvarez as field reporter.\nMLB International fed the series to broadcasters outside the United States, with Matt Vasgersian providing play-by-play and Buck Martinez as color commentator.\nRatings.\nGame1 had the second-lowest audience for any Game1 to date, with only the 2014 World Series having a smaller audience for the opener. Game2 had the lowest audience for any Game2 to date, a distinction previously held by the 2012 World Series. Game4 was the lowest rated World Series game ever, and had the second-smallest audience ever, with only Game3 of the 2008 World Series having a smaller audience. Game7 was the least-watched Game7 ever, falling below the seventh game of 2014. Overall, this World Series had the fourth-lowest average number of viewers, with only 2014, 2012, and 2008 being lower. Ratings spiked considerably for Game 7, and there were strong ratings in the Houston (42.7/63) and Washington, D.C. (31.8/53) markets, making it the most-viewed MLB game in Washington since 1998.\nRadio.\nESPN Radio broadcast the World Series for the 22nd straight year, with coverage presented by AutoZone. Dan Shulman served as play-by-play announcer, with Chris Singleton as color commentator and Buster Olney as field reporter. Marc Kestecher and Kevin Winter hosted the pregame shows with reporter Tim Kurkjian. New Spanish-language radio network Unanimo Deportes, flagshipped at WMYM Miami, broadcast its first World Series with Beto Ferreiro and Orlando Hernández announcing.\nLocally, both teams' flagship radio stations broadcast the series with their regular announcers. In Houston, KBME aired the series with Robert Ford and Steve Sparks announcing. In Washington, WJFK-FM aired the series with Charlie Slowes and Dave Jageler calling the games. Per MLB rules, the teams' other radio affiliates may carry the series but must air the ESPN Radio broadcast.\nAftermath.\nAstros.\nSpeculation about sign stealing by the Astros had been rampant for a number of years. After being knocked out by the Nationals in the National League Division Series, several Dodgers (the team the Astros beat in the 2017 World Series) reached out to Washington Nationals second baseman Brian Dozier, who had been with Los Angeles the previous year, to warn him that Houston was elaborately stealing signs. Many American League clubs also reached out to Washington to say the same as well.\nShortly after the 2019 World Series concluded, on November 12, 2019, journalists Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drellich published a story in \"The Athletic\" detailing for the first time specific allegations that the Astros had engaged in illicit electronic sign stealing. MLB launched an investigation and found evidence that the Astros did engage in illegal electronic sign stealing in 2017 and 2018, but found no evidence that they used the scheme in 2019.\nAfter losing the 2019 World Series, the Astros have continued to be a top team, coming within one win of making the World Series in the shortened 2020 season and returning to the World Series in 2021, which they lost to the Atlanta Braves, and in 2022, when they defeated the Philadelphia Phillies. They were beaten by their in-state rival Texas Rangers in the 2023 ALCS, in which the visiting team won all seven games.\nNationals.\nThe Nationals, however, quickly lost many players from their championship team and fell to the bottom of the league. The Nationals let all-star third baseman Anthony Rendon leave in free agency to the Los Angeles Angels in the offseason (the Angels also signed 2019 Nationals part-time catcher Kurt Suzuki). The COVID-19 pandemic kept the Nationals from properly celebrating their 2019 championship the following season, as spectators were not allowed in the stands during the shortened season. They raised their championship banner in front of an empty Nationals Park on the first day of the 2020 season, and received their championship rings in the clubhouse rather than on the field in front of the fans. The Nationals finished tied for last in the NL East in 2020. Postseason hero Howie Kendrick retired at the end of the season.\nStruggling at the trade deadline in 2021, the Nationals engaged in a large-scale selloff of top players who had led them to the championship. The Nationals became the first team to trade three players who were All-Stars before the end of the season, which included starting pitcher Max Scherzer, outfielder Kyle Schwarber, and shortstop Trea Turner. They also traded off important pieces from their World Series team, such as catcher Yan Gomes and reliever Daniel Hudson. By the end of 2021, only a handful of players from the 2019 championship team were still with the club.\nThe Nationals rotation that many saw as the team's strength during their World Series run was not as effective going forward. Scherzer, although still dominant, struggled with lower body injuries until he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers at the 2021 trade deadline. Scherzer won his second World Series ring with the Texas Rangers in 2023. Patrick Corbin led the National League is losses and earned runs given up in 2021 and 2022. Anibal Sanchez struggled mighty during the 2020 season so much that he spent the 2021 season out of baseball entirely, only to return to Washington in 2022. Lastly, Stephen Strasburg, Washington's MVP of the 2019 World Series, was rewarded with a lucrative seven-year contract with the Nationals after the World Series. Unfortunately, Strasburg suffered many injuries, and he only made a combined eight starts from 2020 to 2023. He threw just 528 pitches in the majors the rest of his career before retiring in 2024.\nBy 2022, the Lerner family were reporting exploring a sale of the Nationals. Later that year at the trade deadline, the team traded superstar Juan Soto, after he rejected a reported 14-year extension, to San Diego for young players and prospects."

        "text": "The Midland Counties Railway viaduct (sometimes referred to as the Avon Viaduct and known locally as the Eleven Arches Viaduct) is a disused railway viaduct at Rugby, Warwickshire, which crosses over both the A426 Rugby to Leicester road, and the River Avon to the north of Rugby town centre.\nArchitecture.\nThe viaduct is approximately long and consists of eleven elliptical arches, high and wide. It is built of red brick, with a facing of Staffordshire blue bricks covering the entire structure apart from impost bands at the tops of the piers and a narrow cornice. It was one of the earliest large structures to make such extensive use of blue engineering bricks.\nHistory.\nThe double track viaduct was built to cross the Avon valley in 1839 by Charles Blacker Vignoles as part of the Midland Counties Railway (MCR) and opened in 1840. It formed part of the MCR's line from Derby and Nottingham to Rugby via Leicester. From Rugby, MCR trains could join the London and Birmingham Railway to access London. The MCR also connected with other lines at its northern end, making the viaduct part of the main railway route from London to the East Midlands and Yorkshire for the first decade of its life, until more direct routes were opened. Besides a viaduct over the River Trent, the viaduct at Rugby was the only substantial bridge on the route and is the only one to survive in its original condition (the Trent viaduct was rebuilt as two bridges in the 1890s). It is one of the UK's oldest disused railway viaducts.\nThe main line over the viaduct was closed in January 1962, but trains continued to use it until May 1965, serving the Oxford Canal basin at nearby Newbold-on-Avon.\nReuse as a cycleway.\nAfter being derelict for decades, the viaduct was brought back into use as a footpath and cycleway in 2012, as part of a £1 million scheme by Rugby Borough Council and the cycling charity Sustrans, in order to create a traffic free route from Rugby town centre to the northern suburbs of Newbold and Brownsover, and the Brownsover industrial estate.\nListing.\nThe viaduct gained Grade II listing in February 2000. It met the criteria for listing because of its \"age, design quality, unaltered nature and its association with an important engineer and railway company\"."

        "text": "The 2019 ITU World Triathlon Series was the 11th season of the World Triathlon Series, the top level international series for triathlon, since its establishment in 2009. The season consisted of eight pairs of triathlon races for both a men's and woman's competition, beginning on 8 March in Abu Dhabi, and concluding on 1 September with the grand final at Lausanne, Switzerland. The season also contained five mixed relays as part of the Mixed Relay Series which offers national teams qualifying points for the mixed team relay event at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\nMario Mola and Vicky Holland began the season as defending champions from the 2018 season. Mario Mola was hoping to defend his title and become the first triathlete to hold the title for four years in a row.\nOverview.\nCalendar.\nThe 2019 ITU World Triathlon Series visited ten cities, including a test run of the 2020 Olympic relay course as part of the Mixed Relay Series.\nPoint System.\nFor every race a triathlete finishes they are awarded points based on their position across the line. For a normal world series event first place is awarded 1000 points and every subsequent place is awarded 7.5% less, for the first forty triathletes, for the grand final 1250 points are awarded once again decreasing by 7.5% for each place but this time awarded down to 50th. However any triathlete outside of the time cut will not be awarded points even if they finish in a scoring position, the time cut is determined by adding 5% to the winner's time in the men's event and 8% in the women's event. A triathletes final score is the sum of their points from the grand final and their best five races of that year.\nSeries.\nAbu Dhabi.\nThe 2019 series began with a sprint distance race in Abu Dhabi in and around the marina on Yas Island. It was the 10th time the race had been held there and the 5th time a sprint distance race was held. The swim course was held in the harbour one 750-metre laps, before heading to transition outside of the Yas Marina Circuit. Athletes then biked five laps of a 4 km course that ran along the Formula 1 circuit. After the bike section, the competitors proceeded to complete two laps of a 2.5 km run circuit over part of the F1 track and part of the marina before finishing the triathlon at the Marina.\nThe competition field for the race included both defending champions Mario Mola and Vicky Holland, as well as most of the top ten athletes from last year's the overall rankings. Also competing was debutante Alex Yee who had won the most recent World cup race in Cape town.\nIn the woman race a small split appeared in the swim which was pushed on the bike such that by the halfway point of bike course, a breakaway of seven was fully established. The group included Americans Zaferes, Spivey and Knibb, along with Learmonth of the UK. The breakaway pushed their advantage such that they had a lead a minute on the chasers by the time they hit the second transition. Zaferes was first out onto the run and lead for the rest of the race pulling away from everyone else to win alone. Spivey floated in between first and the battle for third. Meanwhile, Knibb and Learmonth were neck-and-neck for third and finished in a sprint finish which Learmonth won.\nOn the men's side, whilst a split appeared in the swim and at the start of the bike leg, over the full course of the bike leg the entire field slowly regrouped such that the entire field entered transitioned at the same time. New Zealand's Hayden Wilde initially tried to create a gap on the run, but was soon chased down by the leading pair of Yee and Mola. The pair stayed together and in the lead until with 500m to go Mola upped the pace to claim first with Yee following up in second. Third across the line was Spaniard Fernando Alarza.\nOverall standings.\nIn the individual events, the athlete who accumulates the most points throughout the season is declared the year's world champion.

        "title": "Woodbrook Cricket Club",
        "text": "Woodbrook Cricket Club was a leading Irish cricket club in Bray, County Wicklow from 1905–1913.\nHistory.\nFollowing the death of Sir Henry Cochrane in 1904, his son, Stanley Cochrane inherited his fortune and his Woodbrook Estate, located outside of Bray, County Wicklow. A keen cricketer from his days at Trinity College Dublin, Cochrane decided to form a cricket club on his newly inherited estate in 1905, laying out a private cricket ground. He paid around £1,000 to have hundreds of tonnes of clay imported from Nottinghamshire, England to ensure a top-class playing surface, constructed an indoor cricket school, and hired half a dozen English professional cricketers. Cochrane's vision was to entice the best Irish and English cricketers to represent his new cricket club, as well as bringing first-class cricket to Bray. His ambition to host first-class cricket was achieved in 1907 when Ireland hosted Yorkshire. Two years later, Cochrane's personal XI played the touring Australians at Woodbrook. He also succeeded in attracting professional cricketers to play for the club, including Len Braund, Aubrey Faulkner, Charlie Llewellyn, Hugh Massie, Ernie Vogler, and Teddy Wynyard. The club hosted first-class cricket twice in 1912, and once more in 1913. In the final years of the club's existence, crowd attendances began to drop, and in a desperate measure to revive the club's fortunes, Cochrane attempted to get the deciding Test match of the 1912 Triangular Tournament between England and Australia to be played at Woodbrook, but this request was denied by both boards. Disenchanted by this decision, he wound up the club in 1913 and opted to construct a golf course in its place.\nWoodbrook Club and Ground.\nThe club often played under the name Woodbrook Club and Ground for some of its matches, first playing under that name in 1907 against a touring University of Pennsylvania side, with the team regularly playing under this name against touring teams and English county opposition. The team featured in one first-class match, in 1912 against the touring South Africans. The Woodbrook team, which was captained by Cochrane himself, also featured the Test cricketer Ernie Vogler and arguably the leading Irish cricketer of the time, William Pollock. The 3-day match ended as a draw."

        "title": "Riverside Golf Club",
        "text": "Riverside Golf Club is a private golf club located in North Riverside, Illinois, a near west suburb of Chicago, Illinois. &lt;mapframe latitude=\"41.844501\" longitude=\"-87.830887\" zoom=\"7\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" align=\"right\"&gt;\n \"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n \"features\": [\n \"type\": \"Feature\",\n \"properties\": {},\n \"geometry\": {\n \"type\": \"Point\",\n \"coordinates\": [\n -87.82934188842773,\n 41.84624669727975\n ]\n&lt;/mapframe&gt;\nHistory.\nFounded in 1893, Riverside Golf Club is one of the oldest golf clubs in the United States and was one of pioneering western clubs during the late 19th century. The original course was laid out in 1893 and the club was incorporated in 1897. The golf course straddles the banks of the Des Plaines River between Cermak Road and 26th Street. Though the course has changed and expanded over the years it is still located on substantially the same plot of land as in 1893. In 1899 the club was a founding member of the Western Golf Association.\nAlbert Seckel was Riverside's leading player during its early years, playing in numerous national tournaments. His most important win came at the 1911 Western Amateur contested at Detroit Golf Club. He also finished as runner-up in this event in 1909 and 1924.\nIn the late 1950s the club resisted and overcame a takeover attempt by the University of Illinois at Chicago where the school sought to relocate its campus from Navy Pier to the club's property.\nThe club was basis for the Mac Divot comic strip that was published in the 1960s and 1970s. Mac Divot was created by a member who worked for the Chicago Tribune. Many of the stories in the comic strip were based on real life characters and happenings at the club.\nRiverside was a founding member of the Western Golf Association and is an active supporter of the Evans Scholarship Program, having given out 121 scholarships to caddies.\nGolf course.\nThe original golf course consisted of 3 holes and was expanded to 5 holes later during the 1893 season. A nine-hole course was laid out by founding members William A. Havemeyer, J.S. Driver, and Thomas C. Hannah in 1894. Between 1896 and 1897 the course was expanded and revised, but remained a nine-hole track, and became known as one of the most beautiful and challenging in the west. As of 1901, the course played to a yardage of 3,217 yards with a bogey rating of 43.\nIn the early 1900s many clubs expanded their golf courses to 18 holes but Riverside did not follow suit. This caused the club to fall off the map a bit in terms of prestige and notoriety as it remained a 9-hole course. In the late teens the club purchased additional land adjacent to its original property, on the opposite side (east) of the Des Plaines River. The club built a new clubhouse on the river bank of the newly acquired land. In 1917-1919 William Langford designed a new 18 hole course, reshaping Riverside as one of the top courses in the area. Riverside was possibly one of Langford's first architectural works as it is attributed only to him and not his later partnership known as \"Langford and Moreau\".\nDuring the 1980s the club secured an additional 25 acres of land east of the Des Plaines River and south of the rail line. Four new holes were added on this newly acquired tract which were designed by Dick Nugent and Associates. After these holes were completed 3 holes east of the clubhouse were removed and replaced by a practice facility and new 18th hole. The practice area and 18th hole were designed by Bob Lohmann. The course remained relatively unchanged during the 1990s through 2015.\nIn 2015 Chicago based architect David Esler oversaw a renovation of the golf course. All bunkers were returned to the original Langford style with grass faces, trees were removed, tee boxes were added, and some greens were expanded. Green expansion and restoration projects have continued on a less invasive basis during the succeeding years. From the championship tees, the current course plays to a par of 71 at 6,735 yards and has a course rating/slope of 73.4/136.\nTournaments.\nThe following is a partial list of various local, state, national, and qualifying tournaments hosted by the club:"

        "text": "John Whitty (born 7 November 1977) is an English former professional snooker player.\nCareera.\nJohn Whitty began his snooker career in the 1995–96 snooker season, when the professional tour was still open to all players. In his first tournament, the Thailand Classic, he survived three qualifying rounds. In the Grand Prix he beat, among others, Hugh Abernethy, Steve Judd and Jamie Woodman. He reached the round of the last 96th. At the World Cup, he made it to the best of 19 laps, losing 6–10 to Barry Pinches. The following year, although he reached higher qualifying rounds, under the last 128 but he did not compete at any tournament. He did not get beyond rank 222 in the world ranking list.\nIn the 1997–98 snooker season, the field of players was split into Main Tour and UK Tour. He had to go to the WPBSA Qualifying School. His best result was the group semifinals in the fourth tournament, which was not enough. Instead of big tournaments, he played UK Tour tournaments this year. His best result was the quarterfinals in tournament 4. In 1998/99 he returned to the Main Tour and had his greatest success in the UK Championship. He defeated Darren Clarke and top-64 player Nick Pearce, reaching the main tournament in Bournemouth. There he lost the first round match against Andy Hicks 6–9. At the China International, he reached the round of 96 and two more times the 134. This brought him to number 118 in the world rankings. With that he fell back on the UK tour and after another year lost his professional status.\nHe gave up the Challenge Tour to re-qualification in 2000 after a defeat. In 2001–02 snooker season he played all four tournaments, but once the 32 round was his best result. In the Benson &amp; Hedges Championship, a professional tournament open to amateurs, he reached the round of 32. He starred in the British Amateur Championship, where he lost the final of the southern group. The Challenge Tour 2002/03 was not better than the year before and in 2003–04 snooker season he won only twice in the 4 tournaments. Then he gave up his professional ambitions.\nIn 2010 he played as an amateur again at the English championship. This time he defeated Jeff Cundy with 8–7 in the regional final and then lost the final against Leo Fernandez, 6–10. He took part again in the new year, reaching the Main Tour Players Tour Championship (PTC) and entered two tournaments in Sheffield, the main professional round. He managed to qualify for the World Open 2010. All games were against professional players, but he lost. Only the following year he defeated the Welshman Dominic Dale at the second PTC tournament and moved into the round of 64. In 2012–13 snooker season he was twice in a PTC main tournament, at the Munich Open 2013, for the first time outside England. In the same year, Whitty got an invitation to the 6-Red World Championship. With only 2 wins from 5 games, he survived the group stage and lost in the round of 32 against Robert Milkins. It was his final main tour appearance.\nIn 2012 he played for the first time Amateur Europe Championship and reached the round of 32. The following year he made it to the semifinals, where he lost to Robin Hull. In 2014 he reached the final, but Mitchell Mann denied him the title with a 2–7 defeat. In 2015, he made it again among the 32. At the Amateur World Championship he competed twice, once he was there in the last 32nd\nJohn Whitty is a friend and training partner of Rod Lawler."

        "title": "2021 UEFA Champions League final",
        "text": "The 2021 UEFA Champions League final was the final match of the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League, the 66th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 29th season since it was renamed from the European Cup to the UEFA Champions League. It was played at the Estádio do Dragão in Porto, Portugal on 29 May 2021, between English clubs Manchester City, in their first European Cup final, and 2012 winners Chelsea. This was the third all-English final in the competition, after the 2008 and 2019 finals.\nThe final was originally scheduled to be played at the Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg, Russia. However, due to the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final to Lisbon as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, the final hosts were shifted back a year, with the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey instead planning to host the 2021 final. This was the second consecutive final in Portugal. Two weeks before the final, UEFA announced that it would be relocated to Porto to allow a limited number of fans to attend the match. A capacity limit of 33% was agreed for the 50,000-seater Estádio do Dragão, resulting in an attendance of 14,110.\nChelsea won the final 1–0 for their second UEFA Champions League title, with Kai Havertz scoring the only goal of the game late in the first half. As winners, they earned the right to play against the winners of the 2020–21 UEFA Europa League, Villarreal, in the 2021 UEFA Super Cup, and also qualified for the 2021 FIFA Club World Cup, both of which they won. Chelsea also qualified for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup through UEFA's champions pathway (the winners of the Champions League between 2021 and 2024). Manchester City also qualified after they won the Champions League in 2023.\nTeams.\n\"In the following table, finals until 1992 were in the European Cup era, since 1993 were in the UEFA Champions League era.\"\nVenue.\nThe match was the fourth European Cup/Champions League final to take place in Portugal, and the first to take place outside Lisbon, which previously hosted finals in 1967 at the Estádio Nacional and in 2014 and 2020 at the Estádio da Luz. This was the first time the European Cup/Champions League final took place in the same country in successive seasons. The Estádio do Dragão previously hosted matches at UEFA Euro 2004 and the 2019 UEFA Nations League Finals. Additionally, this final was the first since 2004 to be held in a stadium with capacity lower than 60,000.\nInitial host selection.\nAn open bidding process was launched on 22 September 2017 by UEFA to select the venues of the finals of the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and UEFA Women's Champions League in 2020. Associations had until 31 October 2017 to express interest, and bid dossiers must be submitted by 1 March 2018. Associations hosting matches at UEFA Euro 2020 were not allowed to bid for the 2020 UEFA Champions League final.\nOn 17 June 2020, the UEFA Executive Committee announced that due to the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final to the Estádio da Luz, Istanbul would instead host the 2021 final.\nRelocation to Porto.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey, Premier League side Aston Villa offered to have Villa Park in Birmingham as the venue for the Champions League final instead of Istanbul to hold 8,000 English fans, which could be affected by travel limitations. Villa Park has previously hosted the 1999 Cup Winners' Cup Final, the last final of that UEFA competition. It also hosted the 2012 FA Community Shield, also contested between Manchester City and Chelsea, due to Wembley Stadium – England's national stadium – hosting the Olympic football tournament finals in the previous days, being picked in part because of its equidistance between Manchester and London. On 7 May 2021, Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps advised against any fans traveling to Turkey for the game.\nIn negotiations with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, UEFA would only consider Wembley as a potential venue within the United Kingdom, and required guarantees that their officials, sponsors and journalists would be exempt from the UK COVID-19 travel restrictions. The British Government was unable to agree to this, and on 13 May 2021, UEFA announced the final was relocated to the Estádio do Dragão in Porto, Portugal, a country that was on the British \"green list\" for unrestricted travel during the pandemic.\nBackground.\nManchester City were playing in their first European Cup/UEFA Champions League final. They had previously played in one European final, the 1970 European Cup Winners' Cup Final, and won. They became the ninth distinct English side to play in a European Cup/UEFA Champions League final. This was the third UEFA Champions League final for manager Pep Guardiola, and his first since the two wins with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011, both against Manchester United. City were seeking to become the first club to win its first European Cup/UEFA Champions League final since Chelsea in 2012, with seven clubs having failed to do in between.\nChelsea were playing in their third European Cup/UEFA Champions League final, and the first since their win in 2012 away against Bayern Munich. In addition, they had previously played in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Europa League finals twice each – winning all. In addition, Chelsea became the first club ever to see its men's and women's teams reach the Champions League final in the same season, having qualified for the 2021 UEFA Women's Champions League final as well. Head coach Thomas Tuchel became the first manager to reach the European Cup/UEFA Champions League final in successive seasons with different clubs, having lost the 2020 final to Bayern Munich while coaching Paris Saint-Germain.\nThis was the third all-English final in the history of the competition, after 2008 in Moscow between Chelsea and Manchester United and 2019 in Madrid between Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur. This was also the third consecutive Champions League final to feature a first-time finalist, after Tottenham in 2019 and Paris Saint-Germain in 2020.\nThis was the third meeting between the teams in Europe, having previously met in the semi-finals of the 1970–71 European Cup Winners' Cup, where Chelsea won both legs 1–0 en route to their first European trophy. It was also the second major cup final between them, after the 2019 EFL Cup Final, which City won on penalties following a goalless draw after extra time. The teams met twice during the season's Premier League, with each side winning away: City won the first match 3–1 at Stamford Bridge, while Chelsea won the second 2–1 at Etihad Stadium three weeks before the final. Three weeks before the second league encounter, Chelsea also beat City 1–0 in the FA Cup semi-finals, denying City the chance of winning an unprecedented quadruple.\nRoad to the final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\"\nNotes\nPre-match.\nOfficials.\nOn 12 May 2021, UEFA named Spaniard Antonio Mateu Lahoz as the referee for the final. Mateu Lahoz had been a FIFA referee since 2011, and was previously the fourth official in the 2019 UEFA Champions League final. He officiated six prior matches in the 2020–21 Champions League season, with one match in the play-off round, four in the group stage and one quarter-final leg. He served as a referee at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, and was selected as an official for UEFA Euro 2020. He was joined by six of his fellow countrymen, including assistant referees Pau Cebrián Devís and Roberto Díaz Pérez del Palomar. Carlos del Cerro Grande served as the fourth official, while Alejandro Hernández Hernández acted as the video assistant referee. Juan Martínez Munuera and Íñigo Prieto López de Cerain were appointed as assistant VAR officials, along with Polish referee Paweł Gil.\nOpening ceremony.\nAmerican DJ and electronic music producer Marshmello performed a virtual show for the opening ceremony before the match, along with Selena Gomez and Khalid.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe match kicked off around 8 p.m. in front of a crowd of 14,110. In the fourth minute, Kai Havertz played the ball across the Manchester City penalty area but it was gathered by Ederson. Five minutes later, a long kick from Ederson found Sterling, who controlled the ball and was about to shoot when he was dispossessed by Reece James. Havertz then passed to Werner, who missed the ball from close range when attempting to shoot. In the 15th minute, Mason Mount passed to Werner, who shot straight at Ederson, before then seeing a subsequent strike tipped away for a corner. Ben Chilwell played in a cross to the far post but N'Golo Kante's header went over the Manchester City bar. In the 28th minute, Phil Foden was played in on goal and was about to shoot when Antonio Rüdiger tackled him. Two minutes later, Kyle Walker sent the ball across the Chelsea penalty area but it fizzed just out of Mahrez's reach. With ten minutes of the half remaining, İlkay Gündoğan became the first player to be booked after a foul on Mount.\nIn the 38th minute, Kante played the ball to Havertz, who was denied a shooting opportunity by a tackle from Oleksandr Zinchenko. A minute later, Chelsea were forced to make the first substitution of the match with the injured Thiago Silva being replaced by Andreas Christensen. Three minutes before half-time, Chelsea took the lead. Mount passed to Havertz, who went one-on-one with Ederson, and although the goalkeeper rushed out and deflected the ball away, Havertz passed it into an empty net to make it 1–0. There were three minutes of stoppage time.\nNeither side made any lineup changes during the interval. Manchester City dominated the early stages of the second half. Twelve minutes into the half, Rüdiger was booked for a foul on City's Kevin De Bruyne, who was injured in the challenge, leaving the pitch due to the new concussion protocol, in tears, to be replaced by Gabriel Jesus. Two minutes later, Manchester City appealed for a penalty when the ball struck James on the arm in his own penalty area, but the VAR review decided against a foul, noting that the ball deflecting off James' chest first. In the 64th minute, Bernardo Silva was replaced by Fernandinho for Manchester City before Christian Pulisic came on for Werner for Chelsea.\nWith 21 minutes remaining, City pressed for an equalizer. Mahrez's cross to Gündoğan was cleared by César Azpilicueta. Four minutes later, Pulisic flicked the ball to Havertz, who passed it back to Pulisic, but his attempted shot rolled just past the City goalpost. In the 75th minute, Sterling passed to Jesus, but the ball was cleared by Chilwell. Manchester City made their third substitution when Sergio Agüero, the club's highest goalscorer of all time playing his last ever game, came on for Sterling. Mateo Kovačić was brought on for Chelsea to replace Mount in the 80th minute, and five minutes later, Agüero attempted to find Foden with a lofted cross to the far post, but the ball was easily caught by Édouard Mendy in the Chelsea goal. A minute later, Walker played a cross-field out-swinging pass that narrowly missed both Agüero and Foden.\nTwo minutes from the end of the match, Jesus was booked for a foul on Havertz before Christensen made a block to maintain his side's lead. At the end of regular time, the fourth official displayed that a minimum of seven minutes of stoppage would be played. In the final minute, Mahrez's half-volley from the edge of the Chelsea penalty area went just over the crossbar, and the match was brought to an end with Chelsea winning 1–0.\nDetails.\nA \"home\" team was determined, for \"administrative purposes,\" through a special draw held on 19 March 2021, after the quarter-final and semi-final draws.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "text": "Alexander Stanislavovich Romanov (; born 6 January 2000) is a Russian professional ice hockey defenceman for the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League (NHL). Romanov was selected by the Montreal Canadiens with the 38th overall pick in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft.\nPlaying career.\nAfter two seasons playing in the KHL, Romanov was signed to a three-year, entry-level contract by the Montreal Canadiens on 13 July 2020. Making his debut with the team for the COVID-shortened 2020–21 season, Romanov played in 54 of 56 regular season games. However, he took to the ice in only four of the 22 games in the Canadiens' deep playoff run to the 2021 Stanley Cup Finals. On 5 July 2021, he became the youngest defenseman in Canadiens history to score a goal in the Stanley Cup Finals.\nOn 7 July 2022, during the 2022 NHL Entry Draft, Romanov was traded by the Canadiens, along with a fourth-round pick, to the New York Islanders in exchange for a first-round pick (13th overall). Canadiens general manager Kent Hughes said it was \"very difficult\" to trade Romanov, but that it was a necessary step in a series of trades to acquire centreman Kirby Dach from the Chicago Blackhawks.\nInternational play.\n \nRomanov represented Russia at the 2019 IIHF World Junior Championship in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. He finished with one goal and seven assists, anchoring the Russian defence en route to a bronze medal. Romanov was named the best defenceman of the tournament by the IIHF Directorate and was voted to the All-Star team.\nPersonal life.\nRomanov's maternal grandfather is Zinetula Bilyaletdinov, who played for the Soviet national team from 1974 to 1987 and coached the Russian national ice hockey team from 2011 to 2014. His father is former KHL player Stanislav Nikolaevich Romanov.\nIn October 2020, Romanov married longtime girlfriend and former rhythmic gymnast Sofia Krasovskaya.\nIn February 2023, Romanov and his wife Sofia welcomed their first child, a baby girl."

        "title": "2018 US Open – Women's singles final",
        "text": "The 2018 US Open Women's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Women's Singles tournament at the 2018 US Open. It was contested between Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka, seeded 17th and 20th respectively. Osaka defeated Williams in straight sets, 6–2, 6–4, in one hour and 19 minutes.\nThe match was historically significant for both players. It was Williams' first US Open after a 12-month hiatus to give birth to her first child in September 2017, and second attempt since her pregnancy (after that year's Wimbledon) to equal Margaret Court's all-time record of 24 Grand Slam titles. Osaka was the first Japanese player to contest a Grand Slam women's singles final, and was attempting to become the first Japanese player, male or female, to win a Grand Slam singles title.\nThe match generated significant controversy due to a series of altercations between Williams and chair umpire Carlos Ramos during the second set. Williams' on-court behavior and Ramos' disciplinary actions, and Williams' responses, particularly her invocation of perceived sexism during her arguments with Ramos and officials, and following the match, polarized the tennis community and media worldwide. The International Tennis Federation issued a statement supporting Carlos Ramos' umpiring during the match, stating that his \"decisions were in accordance with the relevant rules and were re-affirmed by the US Open’s decision to fine Serena Williams for the three offences\".\nBackground.\nThe pair met only once previously, with Osaka winning in straight sets in the first round of the 2018 Miami Open.\nWilliams.\nAt the start of the tournament, Williams had won 23 Grand Slam championships, the most in the Open Era, and second-most of all time, and was attempting to equal Margaret Court's all-time record of 24 Grand Slam championships, which required her to best her own record of being the oldest female Grand Slam women's singles champion at the time set at the 2017 Australian Open.\n2018 marked a highly anticipated comeback for Williams since giving birth in September 2017. Her prior successes, and consequent status as one of the greatest tennis players of all time, attracted significant media interest in her pregnancy and motherhood, where she openly revealed almost suffering near-fatal childbirth-related complications as a result of an emergency Caesarian section, requiring five surgeries and leaving her bedridden for six weeks. She used her struggle to cast light on the issue, consequently being hailed as an inspiration for mothers overall, further adding to public anticipation towards her return to tour.\nWilliams' return was, however, difficult. Originally intending to return for the 2018 Australian Open, complications from her pregnancy caused her to miss the tournament, leaving her unable to defend her title from the previous year, and delay her return until the Indian Wells Masters that February, where she lost to older sister Venus in the third round. In the Miami Open two weeks later, Williams would face Osaka for the first time, and only time until their US Open match, in the first round, where Osaka upset Williams in straight sets - Williams' earliest ever exit from the Miami Open in her career. Williams' first Grand Slam campaign since her return at the French Open ended disappointingly, as she withdrew before her fourth round match against Maria Sharapova. However, her Wimbledon campaign the following month was more successful, reaching the final. Despite losing to Angelique Kerber in straight sets, her feat of reaching the final in the first place was seen as both a return to form—Sonia Oxley of BBC Sport quipping that \"she still has the stamina, spirit and shots to carry on collecting Grand Slam titles\", and 2016 men's singles champion Andy Murray noting that \"It is tough to bet against her now she's got this far\"—and a reinforcement of her status as an icon of motherhood and women's empowerment.\nOsaka.\nOsaka was relatively unknown, beginning the year ranked No. 68, having only entered the top 50 briefly in 2016, and having neither been seeded in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament nor advanced beyond the third round. She had, however, made a break at the 2017 US Open, upsetting defending champion Angelique Kerber in the first round, 6–3, 6–1. She improved upon her Grand Slam record at the 2018 Australian Open, advancing to the fourth round where she lost to world No. 1 and eventual runner-up Simona Halep in straight sets, 6–3, 6–2.\nFollowing her 2018 Australian Open campaign, Osaka earned the biggest win of her career at Indian Wells, during which she defeated former World No. 1s Maria Sharapova and Karolína Plíšková, and avenged her Australian Open loss to Halep in the semifinal, before defeating Daria Kasatkina in the final to claim her biggest championship yet. Subsequently, she entered the 2018 French Open seeded 21st, the first Grand Slam tournament in which she was seeded in the main draw. By mid-August 2018, Osaka attained the highest ranking yet of her career at World No. 17, and was the youngest player in the WTA's top 20.\nOsaka entered the main draw of the US Open seeded 20th; however, early round losses on her side of the draw, including those of Australian Open champion Caroline Wozniacki and former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitová, meant that Osaka did not face any player seeded above her until her semifinal with Madison Keys. Osaka qualified for the final having only dropped one set during the entire tournament (in the fourth round against Aryna Sabalenka), and by beating Keys in the semifinal 6–2, 6–4, a match during which she saved all 13 break points she faced. Osaka was the first player from Japan to contest a Grand Slam women's singles final (the second Japanese able-bodied player overall after Kei Nishikori at the 2014 US Open, and fourth player overall after Nishikori, Yui Kamiji and Shingo Kunieda), and was attempting to become the first able-bodied Japanese player, male or female, to win a Grand Slam singles title.\nOsaka's personal admiration for Williams as a primary inspiration for her tennis career was a focal point of the media's interest in her rise. Upon defeating Maria Sharapova in her successful 2018 Indian Wells campaign, Osaka quipped, \"There are three people I wanted to play, Venus, [Sharapova] and Serena. Now I'm just waiting to play Serena.\" Williams has been described as Osaka's \"hero\" and \"idol\", and the US Open final matchup as Osaka's childhood dream; Osaka's focus has been described as \"solely on becoming the next Serena\", Osaka herself remarking that, during challenging scenarios on court, she thinks \"What would Serena do?\" Interviewed following her semi-final victory over Keys, Osaka commented on her thoughts during the match, \"I was just thinking that I really wanted to play Serena, because she is Serena,\" and when asked what her message to Serena would be, simply said, \"I love you.\"\nMatch.\nThe match began at 4:20 p.m. Eastern Time. Carlos Ramos of Portugal was the chair umpire for the match.\nSets.\nThe first set passed by without any major incident, with Osaka breaking twice en route to winning it 6–2.\nWith Williams leading the second set, 1–0, 15-40, chair umpire Ramos gave Williams an official warning for coaching, a code violation under International Tennis Federation rules. Television replays showed her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, gesturing to Serena with his hands and nodding, apparently signalling her to move forward toward the net. Mouratoglou admitted after the match that he did signal some form of coaching from the players' box, but of which he believed Williams was unaware. In response, Williams approached Ramos and told him, \"If he's giving me a thumbs up, he's telling me to come on. We don't have any code, and I know you don't know that, and I understand why you thought that was coaching but I'm telling you it's not. I don't cheat to win. I'd rather lose. I'm just letting you know.\" Osaka won the next point to level the second set, 1–1. During the following court change, leading 2-1, Williams brought up the matter again with Ramos, saying \"it's not something I would do but I could understand why you may have thought that but just know I've never cheated.\" Ramos assured Williams that he understood her, the on-court microphone picking him up telling Williams \"I understood your reaction as well\", which Williams thanked him for; however, the ruling was upheld and the penalty was not retracted.\nAfter breaking Osaka's serve for the first time in the match, Williams was serving at 3–1, at 30-15, however double faulted two points in a row to bring up break point, 30-40. Osaka broke back Williams' serve on the next point to bring the set back on serve, 3–2, as Williams hit the ball into the net on a backhand unforced error, turned to her box in frustration saying (according to on-court commentator Luke Jensen) \"I can't get over the top of the ball\", and smashed her racket on the court. Ramos issued her a second code violation, this time for racket abuse. As her second violation, she was penalized a point, and thus the next game started 15-0 to Osaka's advantage. Upon hearing of this, Williams raised the issue of her first code violation again with Ramos, insisting \"this is unbelievable. Every time I play here I have problems.\" Williams said to Ramos that \"make an announcement that I didn't get coaching ... you owe me an apology, I have never cheated in my life!\" Invoking her recent pregnancy, she further remonstrated that \"I have a daughter and I stand for what is right for her\" and that \"you will never do another one of my matches.\" Despite the disruption, Osaka kept her concentration and held serve the following game to level the set at 3–3, before breaking Williams' serve a second time in the set with a forehand winner to lead 4–3.\nAt the following change of ends, Williams continued to berate Ramos, accusing him of attacking her character by insinuating that she cheated via being coached. She continued to demand an apology from Ramos, commanding, \"you owe me an apology. Say it! Say you're sorry!\" and asserting to him that \"you will never, ever, ever, be on another court of mine as long as you live.\" The exchange culminated in Williams calling the umpire a \"liar\" and a \"thief\". Ramos judged this to be a further code violation for verbal abuse; as the third code violation of the match against Williams, Osaka was awarded the next game by default, bringing the score to 5–3 and Osaka one game away from victory. Williams then demanded to speak to tournament referee Brian Earley and WTA supervisor Donna Kelso, to whom Williams indignantly claimed that such incidents have \"happened to me too many times\", she was being unfairly penalized because she was a woman, and that male players \"do a lot worse\" without penalty, and that \"it happened to me at this tournament every single year\" (Williams had previously been subject to code violations three times in over twenty tournaments here, all of which were upheld). Following this exchange, Williams held her serve to love (at 5–4), and continued to remonstrate with Kelso after the game. Osaka, however, held serve in the following game to win the set 6–4 and the match.\nAftermath.\nUpon defeat, Williams embraced Osaka, but refused to shake Ramos' hand as per game etiquette, instead pointing at him and reasserting, \"You owe me an apology.\" As Ramos left the court, the US crowd booed; Osaka, after greeting her team, did not acknowledge the crowd but immediately returned to her bench and hid her face with her towel.\nThe crowd continued booing as the trophy presentation commenced, interrupting both MC Tom Rinaldi of ESPN and USTA president Katrina Adams several times. Ramos was not present to receive his token of appreciation as is normally the case in Grand Slam finals, and Osaka hid her face under her visor and wept as Williams consoled her. Upon accepting her runner-up plate, Williams, also in tears, attempted to stay positive and encourage the crowd by congratulating Osaka and pleading the crowd not to boo anymore, after which the crowd began to cheer. Upon receiving the trophy, Rinaldi asked Osaka for her thoughts on playing and defeating her idol. Osaka, still in tears, deferred from his question to address the crowd, saying, \"I know everyone was cheering for her and I'm sorry it had to end like this,\" before acknowledging her family, team, and Williams.\nWilliams, in her post-match press conference, raised the gender issue again, saying that the violations made her \"feel like it was a sexist remark\", reasserting that men have said worse things on court without violation, and drawing upon an earlier controversy in the tournament where Alizé Cornet was given a code violation for taking off her shirt on-court (an action male players frequently do), as an example of double standards between men and women in tennis. She alluded to her actions being part of her role to stand up for women's rights and equality, and vowed to continue, a statement which drew both isolated applause and murmurs from the attendees.\nReaction.\nThe on-court incidents of the second set polarized opinions among current and retired tennis players worldwide. Chris Evert (whose Open Era record of 6 US Open women's singles titles Williams would have broken had Williams won), while commentating the match for ESPN, claimed that while first and second code violations were common for similar incidents, it was unprecedented to issue a third code violation (and therefore game penalty) for verbal abuse. Immediately following the match, interviewed while still in the player's box, Mouratoglou admitted to coaching Williams, but doubted whether Williams saw his gestures. Mouratoglou added that \"100% of coaches on 100% of matches\" still commit such actions, calling the response a \"hypocrite thing\" and the act of Williams breaking her racket a normal human emotional reaction to the situation. Evert later agreed with Mouratoglou that \"every coach coaches\" despite it being a violation of rules, and with Williams' point that men have said worse things, including profanities (which Williams did not say), without penalty, but added that Williams' adamant insistence upon an apology aggravated the situation.\nBillie Jean King, former US Open Champion and founder of the Women's Tennis Association, was initially supportive of Williams, tweeting following the match: \"When a woman is emotional, she's 'hysterical' and she's penalized for it. When a man does the same, he's 'outspoken' and there are no repercussions. Thank you, Serena Williams, for calling out this double standard. More voices are needed to do the same.\" However, being interviewed by Christiane Amanpour three days later, King softened her criticism of the perceived double standard, admitting that Ramos did the right thing and could not apologize as Williams demanded in the situation, and placing some responsibility on Williams, saying that \"No one was saying she was a good sport, if they are they're crazy. She was totally out of line.\" King, however, agreed with Evert, that Ramos could have been less strict and given Williams a softer warning prior to any disciplinary actions. In an op-ed for \"The New York Times\", 4-time US Open champion Martina Navratilova claimed Williams' behavior was not excused by the question of whether a male player would have avoided penalty, and added that while Mouratoglou was partly right in saying that coaching was widespread, so is the issuing of penalties for doing so.\nWorldwide opinion was divided following the match, with many branding Williams' behavior \"embarrassing\" and \"ridiculous\", while others claimed she was a victim of blatant sexism. The decision to penalize Williams was also criticized by many, including 2003 men's champion Andy Roddick and two-time US Open finalist Victoria Azarenka, among others. Former world number one Ana Ivanovic, though, distanced herself from the controversy, commending Osaka for her performance throughout the match while also praising Williams for being the champion she is.\nHowever, Williams also received support from WTA chief executive Steve Simon, as well as United States Tennis Association president Katrina Adams, who had been ridiculed for hailing Williams' \"class and sportsmanship\" during the post-match presentation.\nThe International Tennis Federation later issued a statement supporting Carlos Ramos' umpiring during the match, stating that his \"decisions were in accordance with the relevant rules and were re-affirmed by the US Open’s decision to fine Serena Williams for the three offences.\""

The five-round format (three-round qualifying, two-round final) has been eliminated, with single rounds for each of the qualifying and final. The number of team members per NOC has been reduced from four to three (with even more significant impact on the team competition).

There will be between 12 and 14 obstacles, including 1 or 2 double jumps and 1 triple jump, with a maximum of 17 possible jumps (that is, if there are 14 obstacles, only 1 double jump is permitted). The height of obstacles is between 1.40 metres and 1.65 metres, with spread of up to 2 metres (2.20 metres for the triple bar). In general, ties are not broken; however, for the last advancement place, any tie will be broken by combined time. Only if tied on both faults and time will more than 10 teams advance.\nScores do not carry over from the qualifying to the final. The final will feature a course with a minimum distance of 500 metres and a maximum of 700 metres, with the same speed provisions as the qualifying. The number of obstacles will be from 12 to 14, again with 1 or 2 double jumps and 1 triple jump, with a maximum of 18 possible jumps (14 obstacles with 2 doubles and a triple). The height and spread rules remain the same. Ties are generally broken by time (the round is \"against the clock\"), but a tie on faults for first place will be broken by a jump-off. A tie for second or third place will only be broken by a jump-off if the faults and time are the same.\nThe jump-off, if necessary, will feature a six-obstacle course.\nResults.\nQualification.\nThe best 10 teams (including all tied for 10th place) after the team qualifier progress to the team final."

This time, 2016 Olympic bronze medalist and 2019 World Championship silver medalist Evgeny Rylov edged his compatriot Kliment Kolesnikov and defending Olympic champion and world record holder Ryan Murphy, who did not medal in 2019, to win first gold for Russia in this event and also the first gold medal in swimming for Russia since Larisa Ilchenko won the open water competition in 2008. Rylov subsequently repeated the gold medal performance in his signature 200 metres backstroke race.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nNo new records were set during the competition.\nQualification.\nThe Olympic Qualifying Time for the event was 53.85 seconds.

        "text": "The women's 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay event at the 2020 Summer Olympics was held in 2021 at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre. It was the event's seventh consecutive appearance, having been held at every edition since 1996.\nOn the 19th April 2024, United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) says \"at least one member of the Chinese relay team received a doping violation\". As a result, the Chinese team \"will be stripped of their gold medals\", upgrading the American team to gold, the Australians to silver and the previous fourth-place finishers Canada to bronze. However, it was later dismissed by World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in a further statement and critized the comments by Travis Tygart, the CEO of USADA, as \"outrageous, completely false and defamatory remarks\" and critized such allegations as \"politically motivated\". Meanwhile, WADA also highlighted USADA’s the similar conclusions of contamination involving a number of U.S. athletes in the statement.\nSummary.\nIn one of the most unexpected results at these Games, the Chinese women's team pulled off an enormous upset from the favoured Australian team, taking more than a second off Australia's previous world record. China's Yang Junxuan led off the Chinese quartet in a national record of 1:54.37, holding off Australia's 200 freestyle Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus (1:54.51). Though continuing to trade the lead with Australia in the next two legs, Tang Muhan (1:55.00), Zhang Yufei (1:55.66) and Li Bingjie (1:55.30) ultimately combined to register a gold-medal time of 7:40.33. As the Chinese celebrated their surprise victory, Yufei also added the relay gold to her individual triumph in the 200 butterfly earlier in the session.\nThe U.S.' Allison Schmitt (1:56.34), Paige Madden (1:55.25) and Katie McLaughlin (1:55.38) moved themselves to third place on the penultimate leg but were still 1.53 seconds behind the second-placed Australian team. However, a sterling anchor split of 1:53.76 from Katie Ledecky ensured the defending Olympic champions a silver medal in an American Record of 7:40.73. Meanwhile, Australia's Titmus, Emma McKeon (1:55.31) and Madison Wilson (1:55.62) finished second in their respective legs but their anchor Leah Neale (1:55.81) could not keep off Ledecky towards a close finish, leaving the Australians with a bronze in an Oceanic Record of 7:41.29.\nCanada's Summer McIntosh (1:55.74), Rebecca Smith (1:57.30), Kayla Sanchez (1:55.59) and Penny Oleksiak (1:55:14) slipped off the podium to fourth in a national record of 7:43.77. Meanwhile, ROC (7:52.15), Germany (7:53.89), Hungary (7:56.62) and France (7:58.15) rounded out the championship field.\nThe medals for competition were presented by Richard W. Pound, IOC member, and the gifts were presented by Antonio Silva, FINA Bureau Member.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following record was established during the competition:\nQualification.\nThe top 12 teams in this event at the 2019 World Aquatics Championships qualified for the Olympics.

He was the grandson of minister and noted orator, Thomas Starr King.\nAs a freshman at the University of California, King was a member of the varsity rugby team. While at the university, King played primarily at lock. On November 16, 1912, King played for the United States at flanker in its first capped match against Australia—a 12–8 loss. On November 15, 1913, King returned to the United States team, playing at number eight against New Zealand—a 51–3 defeat. By August 1914, King had withdrawn from the University of California and was consequently no longer a member of the rugby team.\nAfter attending the University of California and playing for the United States team, King became a rancher. William King died on July 1, 1937, at the age of 46."

        "text": "The 2019 Monaco Grand Prix (formally known as the Formula 1 Grand Prix de Monaco 2019) was a Formula One motor race held on 26 May 2019 at the Circuit de Monaco, a street circuit that runs through the Principality of Monaco. It was the 6th round of the 2019 Formula One World Championship, the 77th time that the Monaco Grand Prix was held, and the 66th time it had been held as a round of the Formula One World Championship since the inception of the series in .\nThe race was won by Lewis Hamilton after starting from pole, with Sebastian Vettel and Valtteri Bottas promoted to second and third place respectively after Max Verstappen received a penalty, demoting him to fourth place.\nBackground.\nChampionship standings before the race.\nHeading into the race Lewis Hamilton held a 7-point lead over teammate Valtteri Bottas in the Drivers' Championship. In the Constructors' Championship, Mercedes held a 96-point advantage over Ferrari.\nEntrants.\nThe drivers and teams were the same as the season entry list with no additional stand-in drivers for either the race or practice. This race saw Alfa Romeo driver Kimi Räikkönen celebrate his 300th Grand Prix entry.\nEvents preceding the race.\nOn 20 May, less than a week before the race, three-time world champion Niki Lauda died at the age of 70, after a long period of ill health. All teams had since paid tribute to Lauda on the weekend, with Mercedes, whom Lauda had been a key personnel, paid the highest tributes by painting their halos red and including a red three-pointed star on the engine cover on their cars until the remainder of the season.\nQualifying.\nDuring the first qualifying session, Nico Hülkenberg was blocked on his first flying lap by Antonio Giovinazzi at turn 17. Giovinazzi was later handed a three-place grid penalty. Around halfway through the session, after most drivers had come into the pits, Charles Leclerc had set the sixth fastest time. However, Ferrari decided not to send him out again in order to save tyres. As other drivers began to improve their lap times, Leclerc fell down the order and was eventually eliminated from Q1 by teammate Sebastian Vettel, the last driver to cross the line. Ferrari later admitted this was a team mistake. Vettel's final lap was the fastest of the session.\nIn the second qualifying session, Pierre Gasly impeded Romain Grosjean, and was later given a three-place grid penalty. Max Verstappen set the fastest time of the session.\nLewis Hamilton took pole position with a new track record ahead of teammate Valtteri Bottas. As a result, Mercedes equalled the record for most front row lockouts, and Hamilton took the record for most pole positions with one constructor. Max Verstappen qualified in third, his highest qualifying position of the year.\nRace.\nBefore the race started, there was a moment of silence to pay respects to Lauda, with the majority of personnel and fans wearing red caps.\nThe opening lap proceeded cleanly, with Lewis Hamilton maintaining his lead from pole position. Charles Leclerc began to fight through the field after starting in 15th place. Leclerc had made it up to 12th by lap eight, but touched the inside wall at turn 17 during an overtake attempt on Nico Hülkenberg, sending his Ferrari into a spin. This contact caused a right-rear tyre puncture. Over the course of the next lap, Leclerc fell to last place as his tyre ripped apart and caused significant damage to the car's floor, spreading debris around the track. After emerging from the pits after a tyre change, he was a lap down on the leaders. A safety car was deployed on lap 11 for the marshals to clear the debris.\nThe leaders made their pit stops at the end of the lap, during the safety car period. Valtteri Bottas, Max Verstappen and Sebastian Vettel entered the pits all within one car length of each other. Verstappen's pit stop was faster than Bottas's, and Verstappen was released alongside, but slightly ahead of Bottas, with the two cars making contact. Bottas had no choice but to yield at the pit exit, losing second place to Verstappen. Bottas was brought into the pits again on the following lap for a switch from medium to hard-compound tyres and for the team to check for damage, emerging in fourth place behind Vettel.\nRacing resumed on lap 15. On the same lap, Antonio Giovinazzi attempted an overtake on Robert Kubica at turn 17, making contact and sending the Williams into a spin. Kubica's car stopped whilst facing sideways at the exit of the turn, blocking the circuit and forcing Giovinazzi, Hülkenberg, Leclerc, Sergio Pérez and George Russell to stop on track and wait for him to move aside so that they could pass Kubica. Leclerc came into the pits on the following lap for a switch to soft-compound tyres, but on his out-lap, Ferrari decided that the floor damage caused by his lap eight incident was too great. Leclerc returned to the pits and retired from the race, continuing his streak of failing to finish his home Grand Prix, after retiring from the 2018 Monaco Grand Prix and from both races at the 2017 Monaco Formula 2 round.\nOn lap 22, Verstappen was issued a five-second time penalty for his unsafe release in the pits ten laps earlier. On lap 26, Giovinazzi was issued a penalty of ten seconds for causing the incident on lap 15. He later served his penalty in the pits. Verstappen spent the rest of the race attempting to overtake Hamilton, who was suffering on worn tyres, in order to build a lead and win the race despite his penalty. On lap 76, Verstappen mounted his only close challenge of the race, on the inside of turn 10. He made contact with the rear of the Mercedes, causing both cars to cut the chicane. Verstappen was unable to get close enough for an overtake on the subsequent laps, and Hamilton crossed the finish line to take victory. Verstappen's penalty saw him demoted from second to fourth, with Vettel and Bottas promoted to second and third respectively. This marked the sixth consecutive victory in 2019 for Mercedes, but the first time that season that the team did not take a 1–2 finish. Completing the top ten were Gasly (who set the fastest lap of the race), Sainz, Kvyat, Albon, Ricciardo and Grosjean (who was penalized from 9th), both Toro Rosso cars finishing in the points for the first time since the 2017 Spanish Grand Prix, and their best finish since the 2015 United States Grand Prix."

        "text": "The 2019 British Grand Prix (formally known as the Formula 1 Rolex British Grand Prix 2019) was a Formula One motor race held on 14 July 2019 at the Silverstone Circuit in Silverstone, United Kingdom. The race was the 10th round of the 2019 Formula One World Championship. It marked the 74th running of the British Grand Prix, the 70th time that the race has been run as a World Championship event and the 53rd time that the World Championship event has been held at the Silverstone Circuit. Lewis Hamilton won the race for a record sixth time.\nBackground.\nFormally called the \"Formula 1 Rolex British Grand Prix 2019\", this was a Formula One Grand Prix event and the tenth round of the 2019 Formula One World Championship. The event took place over the weekend of 12–14 July 2019 at the Silverstone motor racing circuit in Northamptonshire. The circuit had a lap length of and, prior to the race, a lap record time of 1'30.621, set by Lewis Hamilton during the 2017 British Grand Prix. The race length was set as , which is 52 laps of the circuit. With the first British Grand Prix having been held in 1926 and the second in 1927 and then there having been one held each year since 1948, with each race since 1950 being a World Championship event, the 2019 event was the 74th time that the British Grand Prix had been held and the 70th time it had been a World Championship event.\nThe race was officially started by Charlie Whiting's son, Justin Whiting, as a tribute to his father, who had died prior to the season opening 2019 Australian Grand Prix. Prior to the start of the race, Sebastian Vettel gave a brief speech in commemoration of Whiting. \nChampionship standings before the race.\nHeading into the race, Lewis Hamilton had a 31-point advantage over teammate Valtteri Bottas in the Drivers' Championship. In the Constructors' Championship, Mercedes held a 135-point advantage over Ferrari.\nEntrants.\nThe drivers and teams entered were the same as those on the season entry list with no additional stand-in drivers for either the race or practice.\nPractice.\nThe first practice session ended with Pierre Gasly fastest for Red Bull almost half a second ahead of second placed Valtteri Bottas who was a further 0.4 seconds ahead of Gasly's teammate Max Verstappen. The only major incidents were Romain Grosjean crashing his car on the pit exit and Kimi Räikkönen's Alfa Romeo stopping on the Wellington straight, the latter of which brought out a red flag. The drivers all struggled with track grip levels throughout the session due to the track having been recently resurfaced and although there was some brief rain it had little impact on the running in the session.\nRace.\nRace summary.\nOn Lap 1, the two Haas drivers collided at the exit of turn five. Both cars pitted, but both would go on to retire as a result of the damage, Kevin Magnussen on Lap 6 and Romain Grosjean on Lap 9. Valtteri Bottas and Lewis Hamilton fought for the lead, with Bottas maintaining 1st place until Lap 4, when Hamilton overtook at turn seven. Bottas then regained the lead shortly after at turn nine.\nAfter battling for 3rd place in the preceding laps, Charles Leclerc and Max Verstappen entered the pits at the same time on Lap 14, with Leclerc ahead. The Red Bull pit stop was the faster of the two and Verstappen emerged in front after the two cars were side by side whilst driving through the pit-lane. However, this lead would not last, as Verstappen ran wide shortly after at turn 4, allowing Leclerc through.\nBottas pitted from the lead at the end of Lap 16, emerging behind Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel. Three laps later, Antonio Giovinazzi, who was running in 9th place, suffered a mechanical failure and spun into the gravel at turn 16. This incident brought out the safety car, allowing Hamilton an advantageous pit stop, maintaining the lead from Bottas. Other drivers including Vettel, Leclerc, Verstappen and Pierre Gasly also came into the pits.\nRacing resumed on Lap 24. Sergio Pérez and Nico Hülkenberg made contact shortly after the restart, damaging Pérez's front wing. This forced Pérez to pit and caused him to eventually finish the race last of the running cars in 17th place. Verstappen and Leclerc continued to battle for position, until Verstappen began to pull away and was allowed through by his teammate Gasly, taking 4th place.\nLeclerc overtook Gasly around the outside of turn 3 on Lap 36, taking 5th position. Shortly after, Verstappen took 3rd place from Vettel on the Hangar Straight. However, in an attempt to retake the position, Vettel locked up his brakes and collided with the back of the Red Bull at the entry to turn 16. Both cars spun into the gravel, but were able to escape and continue the race, with them both emerging behind Leclerc and Gasly. Vettel fell down the order over the remainder of the lap due to damage to his front wing, before pitting to have it replaced. He would go on to cross the line in 15th place, but was handed a 10-second penalty for causing a collision, demoting him to 16th.\nLewis Hamilton won the race for a record sixth time, claiming the extra point for recording the fastest lap of the race on his final lap, and setting a new lap record of 1:27.369.\nOn lap 12, for Pierre Gasly's pit stop, the Red Bull Racing team broke the record for the fastest pit stop time, with 1.91 seconds, beating the previous time of 1.92 seconds, which was jointly held by Red Bull and Williams and had stood since 2013."

        "text": "The 2019 Italian Grand Prix (formally known as the Formula 1 Gran Premio Heineken d'Italia 2019) was a Formula One motor race held on 8 September 2019 at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza in Monza, Italy. The race was the 14th round of the 2019 Formula One World Championship and marked the 89th running of the Italian Grand Prix and the 84th time the race had been held at Monza. The Grand Prix ended with Leclerc claiming his second consecutive race win and Ferrari's first win in Italy since Fernando Alonso won the 2010 edition of the race.\nBackground.\nChampionship standings before the race.\nMercedes driver Lewis Hamilton entered the round with a 65-point lead over teammate Valtteri Bottas in the Drivers' Championship. In the Constructors' World Championship, Mercedes led Ferrari by 145 points.\nEntries.\nThe drivers and teams entered were the same as those for the previous race with no additional stand-in drivers for the race or practice.\nPractice.\nThe first practice session was affected by rain and saw Charles Leclerc finish the session fastest followed by Carlos Sainz Jr. and Lando Norris. The session was interrupted three times, firstly when Kimi Räikkönen spun and got stuck in the gravel trap at turn 11. Sergio Pérez also crashed his car on the exit of turn 10 and finally when Pierre Gasly beached his car on the kerbs at turn 2. The session was also filled with spins from a number of other drivers.\nThe second practice session was dry for the first hour before it started raining and the session once again saw Leclerc set the fastest time but this time it was Lewis Hamilton who was second fastest and Sebastian Vettel was third. The third practice session was delayed and shortened by 10 minutes following an accident during the support Formula 3 race and finished with Vettel fastest followed by Max Verstappen and Valtteri Bottas.\nQualifying.\nQualifying report.\nQ1 and Q2.\nThe first 18-minute qualifying session, Q1, was temporarily red-flagged with 4:34 remaining, when Sergio Pérez's car lost power on the inside of turn 3. Max Verstappen, already facing grid penalties for replacing power unit components, did not set a time in the session. Verstappen and Pérez were eliminated in Q1, as were both Williams drivers, Robert Kubica and George Russell, and the Haas of Romain Grosjean. The session finished with Charles Leclerc fastest for Scuderia Ferrari. In the second qualifying (Q2) session, the other Haas of Kevin Magnussen was eliminated, as were both Toro Rosso drivers, Pierre Gasly and Daniil Kvyat. Alfa Romeo's Antonio Giovinazzi was the final driver eliminated in Q2, beaten by his teammate Kimi Räikkönen for the last spot for the third qualifying session (Q3) by 0.002 seconds. Racing Point driver Lance Stroll made it into Q3 for the first time in 2019. Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time of Q2 which meant that Mercedes led a session for the first time in the weekend.\nQ3.\nQ3, only 12 minutes long, was red-flagged at 6:35 left when Räikkönen lost control of his car and spun out wide into the tyre barriers at turn 11. After Räikkönen's car was cleared and the session resumed, two of the remaining nine drivers had still not set a time; Red Bull's Alexander Albon, and Stroll. When the session restarted, no team wanted to be the first to send their driver out as Monza is a track where slipstreaming is a significant advantage. As time began to wind down, speculation grew as to who would leave the pit lane first. The Q3 drivers did not make their way out of their garages until there were two minutes left in the session, with Renault driver Nico Hülkenberg leading the pack.\nWhen he got to turn 1, Hülkenberg missed the turn and instead navigated through the run-off slip road past Turn 1. This action led to him being accused of deliberately taking the run-off in an effort to let other drivers past. Stroll and Carlos Sainz Jr, the next two drivers back, slowed their traversal of Turn 1, allowing enough time for Hülkenberg to again enter the track ahead of them. By the time the tight pack of drivers, led by Sainz and Hülkenberg, reached turn 3 on their out-laps, the margin of error allowing for drivers to reach the start line by the end of the Q3 session time was virtually gone. Ultimately, only Sainz and Leclerc successfully completed their out laps. All seven drivers behind them were caught out and thus crossed the line too late to have an opportunity to set a time in the second half of Q3. Sainz, the only driver who made a meaningful attempt, was unable to improve his first Q3 time enough to move out of seventh. The result meant that neither Albon or Stroll set a lap time.\nThere was strong criticism of what had happened in the final minutes of Q3. Red Bull's team principal Christian Horner's interpretation of Hülkenberg's move was that it was \"obviously done on purpose\", and beyond stating that the result was \"all just a bit silly\", interpreted the scenario with a widely reported expletive. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff described Hülkenberg's chicane cut and the collective drivers' out-lap slowdowns as \"junior class\", and \"not worthy of Formula 1.\"\nHülkenberg, Sainz, and Stroll were called in by the race stewards to be investigated for \"driving unnecessarily slowly\" on their Q3 out laps. The stewards further investigated Hülkenberg for potentially \"leaving the track without a justifiable reason\". Hülkenberg was cleared of wrongdoing with respect to leaving the track. The stewards stated, \"In this case we are unable to determine that the driver deliberately left the track.\" All three of the drivers were reprimanded for driving too slowly, which they admitted they did do, and which the stewards concluded \"played a significant role in the backing up of cars at a critical stage of the final out lap for Q3\". The race stewards concluded the investigation of the three drivers with the remark, \"The Stewards strongly recommend that the FIA expedite a solution to this type of situation\".\nRace.\nRace report.\nThe top four drivers on the grid maintained their positions through turn 1 as the race began, with Charles Leclerc turning pole position into an early race lead. Max Verstappen, who started 19th on the grid, made contact with Sergio Pérez, damaging his front wing and requiring an early pit stop to replace it.\nOn lap 6, Sebastian Vettel, running a strong 4th, lost control and spun to a stop at turn 9, his car halfway onto the grass. In an attempt to rejoin as quickly as possible, Vettel veered into the path of Lance Stroll, who was in 7th. Vettel struck Stroll, damaging his own front wing, and further causing Stroll to spin out. When Stroll tried to rejoin the track, he in turn forced Pierre Gasly to drive through the gravel run off to in an attempt to avoid Stroll. Vettel was forced to replace his front wing at the end of lap 6, leaving him in last place. Stroll was pushed down to 13th. Race stewards investigated the double-incident. They penalised Vettel with a ten-second stop-go penalty, and Stroll with a drive-through penalty. Neither driver would recover to finish in the top ten. Vettel also received three penalty points on his FIA Super Licence for the incident.\nPit stops.\nBy lap 19, the top three drivers (Leclerc, Lewis Hamilton, and Valtteri Bottas, in order) were in a pit window to replace the aging soft tyres they started their races on. Hamilton was the first to do so, replacing his with medium tyres. Leclerc pitted on lap 20, but elected instead to use the longer lasting but slower hard tyre. Bottas, who also chose the medium tyre, would not pit until lap 27. All three drivers returned to racing in the same order they'd been in before their pit stops. Carlos Sainz retired from the race on lap 29, after an error fitting his right front tyre in the pits forced him to stop near the exit to pit lane; this caused a brief virtual safety car. Shortly after, Daniil Kvyat's Toro Rosso suffered a mechanical breakdown just past turn 1, causing a second virtual safety car while his car was pushed to safety.\nIn the meantime, Leclerc's lead would be challenged for the remainder of the race by the Mercedes drivers behind him. After Leclerc and Hamilton's pit stops, Hamilton came close on several occasions to overtaking Leclerc, more than once less than one second behind and enabling him to use DRS. Both drivers exchanged occasional driving errors and Leclerc was warned once for pushing Hamilton off track. Hamilton consistently stayed close to Leclerc, but was unable to overtake him for the race lead. On lap 42, Hamilton locked up his tyres at turn 1, allowing Bottas to pass him into 2nd position. Bottas, who had medium tyres eight laps younger than Hamilton's, was able to challenge Leclerc for the lead just as Hamilton had done. Bottas came within one second of Leclerc on multiple occasions in the race's later stages, but, like Hamilton, he could not overtake Leclerc.\nRace finish.\nThe Grand Prix ended with Leclerc claiming his second consecutive race win and Ferrari's first win in Italy since Fernando Alonso won the 2010 edition of the race. It would be Leclerc's last victory until the 2022 Bahrain Grand Prix. Bottas was less than a second behind to take 2nd, and Hamilton, who made a late-race pit stop for soft tyres set the fastest lap of the race and took the last step of the podium. Renault's Daniel Ricciardo and Nico Hülkenberg finished strong in 4th and 5th positions, promoting Renault into 5th in the Constructor's championship. This also meant that they were only 18 points behind fourth placed McLaren. Alexander Albon managed a 6th-place finish for Red Bull, finishing one second behind Hulkenberg. Pérez and Verstappen, who both started at the back of the grid, ended in 7th and 8th. Antonio Giovinazzi (Alfa Romeo) finished 9th and Lando Norris (McLaren) finished in tenth, the final points position."

        "title": "2019 Singapore Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2019 Singapore Grand Prix (formally known as the Formula 1 Singapore Airlines Singapore Grand Prix 2019) was a Formula One motor race held on 22 September 2019 at the Marina Bay Street Circuit in Marina Bay, Singapore. The race was the 15th round of the 2019 Formula One World Championship and marked the 20th running of the Singapore Grand Prix and the 12th time the race had been held at Marina Bay.\nSebastian Vettel won the race ahead of teammate Charles Leclerc and Max Verstappen, while Kevin Magnussen set the fastest lap. This was the last race in the micro-nation for two years, as the 2020 and 2021 races were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was also the last win and 1–2 finish for Ferrari until the 2022 Bahrain Grand Prix, as well as Vettel's last win of his F1 career and, as of 2024, the last win for a German Formula One driver.\nBackground.\nTrack changes.\nAhead of the race it was announced that a third DRS zone would be added between turns 13 and 14, down the Esplanade Drive, to aid overtaking. The detection point is established before turn 13.\nChampionship standings before the race.\nEntering the round Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes led the drivers and constructors championships by 63 and 154 points respectively. The size of their leads meant that both would still be leading their respective championships after the race regardless of the race's outcome.\nEntries.\nThe drivers and teams entered were the same as those for the previous race with no additional stand-in drivers for the race or practice. This race was the first occasion that Haas entered a race without title sponsor Rich Energy following the termination of the sponsorship contract.\nPractice.\nFP1.\nCharles Leclerc retired early into FP1 and Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas suffered a snap of oversteer, causing a crash at Turn 19. Thus, a red flag was brought out. Max Verstappen led the timing charts, 0.167 seconds ahead of 2nd place Sebastian Vettel during the practice session. Nico Hulkenberg set an impressive time, landing him 6th on the timing charts, albeit 1.5 seconds off of Verstappen.\nFP2.\nEarly in the session Alexander Albon lost his front wing after locking up and bumping the wall at Turn 10. Lewis Hamilton gained an edge over Verstappen during the session, topping timing charts 0.184 seconds ahead of him. Leclerc managed to set a lap, though he was 1.245 seconds off of Hamilton. The two Ferrari drivers were reportedly frustrated after encountering numerous traffic incidents. Carlos Sainz managed P7, 1.3 seconds off of Hamilton.\nRace.\nDaniel Ricciardo and George Russell made contact at turn one on the first lap, causing damage to Russell's front wing. Nico Hülkenberg and Carlos Sainz Jr. collided at turn five, also on lap one, with both cars suffering punctures. Russell, Hülkenberg and Sainz subsequently all made pit stops at the end of the first lap, fitting the hard-compound tyres with Russell also replacing his front wing. Sainz's mechanics encountered a problem with the rear jack during his pit stop and the car was therefore stationary for 42.4 seconds. Sainz subsequently emerged from the pits a lap down on the leaders and with aerodynamic damage caused by the punctured tyre.\nFor the following laps, the leaders of the race cut their pace considerably in order to conserve tyres and manage their cars' temperatures, often lapping nearly 15 seconds slower than the pole time. This had the effect of bunching up the field, and the usual gap between the front-running and midfield cars did not appear. At the end of lap 19, Sebastian Vettel and Max Verstappen became the first of the front-runners to make a pit stop, from third and fourth place respectively. Vettel emerged in tenth place, whilst Verstappen emerged in twelfth behind Hülkenberg. Charles Leclerc made his pit stop from the lead on the following lap, emerging behind his Ferrari teammate and thus handing the net lead of the race to Vettel.\nLewis Hamilton, who was yet to stop, inherited the lead of the race. Valtteri Bottas made his pit stop at the end of lap 22, emerging behind Verstappen and ahead of Alexander Albon, maintaining his net position. Hamilton was left out on ageing soft-compound tyres until the end of lap 26, in the hope that the Ferrari drivers, at the time running in sixth and seventh, would be slowed down by the midfield cars ahead. This plan did not work, and Hamilton emerged from the pits not only behind both Ferrari drivers, but also almost six seconds behind Verstappen. Hamilton did come out ahead of his teammate Bottas, who was instructed to slow down after his pit stop to ensure Hamilton would leave the pit lane ahead of him. Due to the slow pace of the lead cars in previous laps, they emerged behind the midfield cars of Antonio Giovinazzi, Pierre Gasly, Ricciardo and Lance Stroll. Vettel and Leclerc began to make their way through this group, with Vettel cementing his net lead by clearing the cars quicker than his teammate. Giovinazzi held the lead of the race for four laps until he was overtaken by Vettel on lap 31. This marked the first time a team other than Mercedes, Ferrari or Red Bull had led a race lap since Bottas led for Williams at the 2015 British Grand Prix and the first time Alfa Romeo had done so since Andrea de Cesaris led the 1983 Belgian Grand Prix.\nAfter the front-running cars had cleared the midfield cars on lap 34, the order was Vettel, Leclerc, Verstappen, Hamilton, Bottas, Albon, Giovinazzi, Ricciardo, Hülkenberg and Lando Norris. Ricciardo attempted an overtake on Giovinazzi, with the two cars colliding. Giovinazzi was pushed off the track and lost places to Hülkenberg and Norris, whilst Ricciardo suffered a puncture causing him to drop down the order and forcing a pit stop at the end of the lap. He emerged from the pits in 18th place. On lap 34, Romain Grosjean attempted to overtake Russell around the outside of turn eight. Grosjean clipped the left rear of Russell's car, causing the Williams to swerve into the outside wall. This marked Willams' first retirement of the season and the first retirement of Russell's career. The incident brought out the safety car as the Williams was cleared from the track. Grosjean suffered a damaged front wing, making a pit stop at the end of the lap for a replacement and dropping him to 18th place. The stewards later deemed the collision a racing incident, and no action was taken.\nRacing resumed on lap 41. Lance Stroll, running in 13th place, clipped the inside of the wall at turn 17, causing a puncture and front wing damage. He returned to the pits and emerged last of the running cars in 19th. On lap 43, Stroll's teammate Sergio Pérez pulled over to the side of the track from tenth place after suffering an oil leak. The safety car was brought out whilst the marshals removed Pérez's stranded car. Racing resumed again on lap 48, on lap 50 Daniil Kvyat attempted an overtake for twelfth place on the inside of Kimi Räikkönen at turn one. The cars made contact through their front wheels and the impact broke the suspension of Räikkönen's car. The incident brought out the third safety car of the race.\nThe safety car came in on lap 52. The final ten laps saw Charles Leclerc unsuccessfully attempt to catch his teammate Sebastian Vettel. After being overtaken by Robert Kubica and falling to last place, Kevin Magnussen took a pit stop at the end of lap 57, switching to soft-compound tyres and setting the fastest lap of the race. Since he finished the race in 17th place, Magnussen was not awarded the point for the fastest lap, which is only available if the driver finishes in the top ten. Vettel crossed the finish line to take victory, his first win since the 2018 Belgian Grand Prix, it was also his final win in his Formula 1 career. With Leclerc finishing second, this was Ferrari's first 1–2 finish since the 2017 Hungarian Grand Prix, and the first time a team has ever recorded a 1–2 finish at Singapore since the race became a Formula One World Championship event in 2008.\nAfter the race Giovinazzi was summoned to the stewards for allegedly driving too close to the recovery crane after George Russell's crash on lap 34. Giovinazzi was given a 10-second penalty, however, since he finished 18 seconds ahead of Romain Grosjean, this did not affect his tenth-place finish."

        "text": "The 2019 Japanese Grand Prix (formally known as the Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix 2019) was a Formula One racing event held on 13 October 2019 at the Suzuka International Racing Course in Suzuka in the Mie Prefecture, Japan. The race was the 17th round of the 2019 Formula One World Championship and marked the 45th running of the Japanese Grand Prix. The 2019 event was the 35th time that the race had been run as a World Championship event since the inaugural season in 1950, and the 31st time that it had been held at Suzuka.\nBackground.\nFormally called the \"Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix 2019\", this Formula One Grand Prix event took place on 13 October 2019 at the Suzuka International Racing Course in Japan. The circuit, which held its first Grand Prix in 1987, has a lap length of and the 53-lap race distance is . Going into the race, the lap record, of 1 minute 31.540 seconds, was held by Kimi Räikkönen who took it at the 2005 Grand Prix.\nWeather.\nDue to the weather forecasts relating to Typhoon Hagibis, all the events planned for Saturday were cancelled. This included the Free Practice 3 session and qualifying, the latter of which was rescheduled for Sunday morning, a few hours before the race was due to start.\nChampionship standings before the race.\nHeading into the 17th round of the championship, Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton led the Drivers' Championship with 322 points, 73 points ahead of teammate Valtteri Bottas. Third in the Drivers' Championship was Ferrari's driver Charles Leclerc with 215 points, with Max Verstappen from Red Bull Racing and Leclerc's teammate Sebastian Vettel in fourth and fifth places respectively. In the Constructors' Championship, Mercedes held a 162-point lead over second place Ferrari, with Red Bull Racing in third place. McLaren and Renault completed the top five.\nEntrants.\nThe drivers and teams were the same as the season entry list with no additional stand-in drivers for the race. However, Japanese driver Naoki Yamamoto drove in the first practice session for Scuderia Toro Rosso, replacing Pierre Gasly. As a result, Yamamoto became the first Japanese driver in F1 since Kamui Kobayashi.\nThe main title sponsor of Ferrari, Mission Winnow, returned from this race, after it was used by the Scuderia at the Bahrain, Chinese, Azerbaijan, Spanish and Monaco Grands Prix, but was not used at the and from the until the Russian Grand Prix for legal reasons.\nQualifying.\nQualifying began on Sunday morning at 10:00am JST (UTC+9:00), just over 4 hours before the race was due to start. The skies were clear after Typhoon Hagibis had passed the previous day, however, there were still heavy winds affecting the circuit.\nQ1\nTwo minutes into the session Robert Kubica hit the outside wall at the exit of turn 18 after running wide onto the grass destroying the car's front wing and left-hand wheels and causing significant damage to the survival cell. Kubica was uninjured and the session was red-flagged whilst his car was recovered and debris was cleared from the track. Four minutes after the session restarted Kevin Magnussen spun at the same corner causing him to reverse into the outside wall, damaging his gearbox, front and rear wings. The red flags came out again, however, Magnussen was able to continue driving completing a lap and entering the pits. Neither Kubica nor Magnussen were able to set a qualifying time, however, Williams and Haas were able to repair their respective cars before the beginning of the race with Kubica starting from the pit lane after his survival cell was replaced. Charles Leclerc set the fastest time of Q1 whilst Daniel Ricciardo, Sergio Pérez and George Russell were eliminated alongside Kubica and Magnussen.\nQ2\nAfter setting the 15th fastest time, Nico Hülkenberg's car suffered a loss of hydraulic pressure causing him to be stuck in gear. Hülkenberg slowly returned to the pits and his car was retired from the session. Valtteri Bottas set the fastest time of Q2 with Antonio Giovinazzi, Lance Stroll, Kimi Räikkönen and Daniil Kvyat being eliminated alongside Hülkenberg.\nQ3\nSebastian Vettel took pole position ahead of Leclerc and Bottas. This was Vettel's first pole position since the Canadian Grand Prix and the fifth consecutive pole position for Ferrari. The team took their 64th front-row lockout, equalling Mercedes's record. The pole position time of 1:27.064, which was set by the German driver, meaning the fastest ever lap made in Suzuka, beating the previous best ever lap of 1:27.319, which was set by Lewis Hamilton during the qualifying of the 2017 edition. Vettel's pole would eventually turn out to be his final in Formula One.\nRace.\nAt the start of the race Sebastian Vettel, on pole position, moved a fraction of a second too early. He was able to stop before overstepping his grid line, but this led to a poor start and the Ferrari was passed by the Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas almost immediately. Vettel was investigated for a false start, however the stewards later decided against penalising him given that he did not overstep his line and thus the sensors used to detect a false start were not triggered. Max Verstappen attempted an overtake on the outside of Charles Leclerc through turn 2 for third place, however, Leclerc understeered into Verstappen causing the Red Bull to spin out onto the grass. The collision resulted in significant damage to Verstappen's car and to Leclerc's front wing (also his left wing mirror), although both cars were able to continue racing.\nLeclerc was instructed by his team to enter the pits at the end of the opening lap, however, he was not aware of the damage to his front wing and stayed out on track as the damaged front wing wasn't affecting his performance significantly. Over the course of the second lap pieces of Leclerc's front wing broke off before the endplate detached entirely on the straight after turn 14, this endplate then hit Lewis Hamilton's car, which was directly behind him, breaking off one of the Mercedes's wing mirrors. After initially informing the stewards that Leclerc would pit at the end of lap 2 the team felt his car was now safe and instructed him to stay out for a third lap after which the race director ordered the car be brought into the pits to change its front wing. On lap 2 the stewards deemed the collision between Leclerc and Verstappen a racing incident with no investigation necessary.\nOn lap 4 Alexander Albon attempted an overtake on the inside of Lando Norris at turn 16. The cars collided and Norris was left with floor damage harming his pace for the rest of the race. The incident was not investigated by the stewards. Norris had also earlier collected debris from Leclerc's front wing in his brake ducts which forced him to pit to avoid a brake fire dropping him to the back of the field. On lap 7 the stewards decided to re-open the investigation into the lap 1 collision between Leclerc and Verstappen, later deciding that the incident would be investigated after the race. Both drivers were by now attempting to come back through the field with Leclerc passing Verstappen for 16th place on lap 9. Verstappen's car was later retired from the race on lap 14 after having only managed to pass the two Williams cars with the team deciding that the damage from the opening lap incident was too great to continue.\nOn lap 15 Albon was the first of the front-runners to make a pit stop from fifth place, Vettel then pitted on lap 16 from second place as did Bottas from the lead on lap 17 causing Hamilton to inherit the race lead. Hamilton pitted on lap 21 handing the lead back to Bottas and restoring the order of the top three. Hamilton was fitted with medium-compound tyres with the team informing him that the plan was for him not to make another pit stop. This was despite degradation from previous laps meaning that he was now over 20 seconds behind the race leader. This made it improbable that Hamilton would be able to stay close enough to the leaders for him to take the race lead when Bottas and Vettel made an additional pit stop if Hamilton would have to preserve his tyres to last till the end of the race. Hamilton criticised the decision not to use hard-compound tyres, telling the team over radio \"I'm out of the race now\" after the team admitted that it was likely that Hamilton would have to make a second pit stop.\nCarlos Sainz made his pit stop from fourth place on lap 26 emerging behind Albon, meaning the Red Bull had gained a position over Sainz through the pit stops. Vettel made a second pit stop on lap 31 emerging in third place. By lap 34 Leclerc had made it past Pierre Gasly and into sixth place from the back of the field. Bottas made his second stop on lap 36 coming out in second place behind Hamilton. Hamilton was later pitted on lap 42 emerging in 3rd place behind Vettel. Leclerc was unable to keep up with Sainz's McLaren in the closing laps and the team decided to pit him on lap 47 for an attempt to claim the point for fastest lap.\nOn the final lap Sergio Pérez attempted an overtake around the outside of Gasly for eighth place at turn 2. The two cars collided sending Pérez into the gravel. Under normal conditions Pérez would have been classified in 17th place as the two Williams cars were a lap behind him. However, the chequered flag lighting panels had mistakenly been shown to the leaders a lap early meaning that the results of the race were taken from the end of the 52nd lap. Thus, Pérez kept ninth place. Hamilton spent the closing laps attempting to catch and overtake Vettel but was ultimately unsuccessful. However, Hamilton was able to claim the fastest lap point. With Bottas crossing the line to take victory, Leclerc, Verstappen and Vettel were eliminated from the Drivers' Championship title contention. This, together with Mercedes outscoring Ferrari, their closest rivals, by 17 points, meant that Mercedes were assured their sixth consecutive Drivers' and Constructors' championships (with the Drivers' Championship winner still undecided between Hamilton and Bottas), a feat never before achieved by a team in the history of Formula One (the previous record was five consecutive Drivers' and six consecutive Constructors' championships for Ferrari between and ).\nAfter the race, Leclerc was handed two penalties: a 5-second penalty for causing the collision with Verstappen, and a 10-second penalty for driving in an unsafe condition in the following laps. This demoted him to seventh place behind Daniel Ricciardo. Racing Point submitted a protest to the stewards over alleged illegal use of a \"pre-set lap distance-dependent brake bias adjustment system\" by Renault. On 23 October, ten days after the race, Renault was found to have used illegal driver aids and both drivers were disqualified from the results of the race, hence Leclerc kept his sixth place.\nOn lap 45, Lewis Hamilton scored the new race lap record in Suzuka, with a time of 1:30.983, beating the previous race lap record time of 1:31.540, which was set by Kimi Räikkönen at the 2005 Japanese Grand Prix."

        "title": "Opener (baseball)",
        "text": "In baseball, an opening pitcher, more frequently referred to as an opener, is a pitcher who specializes in getting the first outs in a game, before being replaced by a long reliever or a pitcher who would typically be a starting pitcher. Pitchers employed in the role of opener have usually been relief pitchers by trade. The strategy was frequently employed in Major League Baseball (MLB) by the Tampa Bay Rays during the 2018 season, when it was adopted by other teams as well.\nConcept and early use.\nBy the 1980s, MLB teams had adopted starting rotations consisting of five starting pitchers, with all other pitchers on the active roster serving as relief pitchers. Traditionally, a starter was expected to throw the most innings of any pitcher in a game. Starters typically pitched until they got into trouble or reached a pitch count threshold, or the game ended.\nIn Game 7 of the 1924 World Series, the Washington Senators had their starting pitcher, the right-handed Curly Ogden, pitch to only two batters and then brought in a left-handed pitcher, with the intent of locking the opposing team into their left-handed lineup. Similarly, in the 1990 National League Championship Series, the Pittsburgh Pirates decided to open the game with right-handed relief pitcher Ted Power before installing the announced starting pitcher, left-hander Zane Smith, in an attempt to get the Cincinnati Reds to change their batting lineup. In 1993, the Oakland Athletics had a poor starting rotation, and manager Tony La Russa and pitching coach Dave Duncan split their pitchers into platoons, with a core of dedicated relief pitchers. Though the experiment lasted for only six games before the Athletics returned to a traditional starting rotation, Ron Darling, a member of the 1993 Athletics, called it \"a precursor to all the things that you see today\". La Russa and Duncan also used an opener on the last day of the 2007 Major League Baseball season when their St. Louis Cardinals handed the ball to Troy Percival, a longtime closer with 358 career saves and 702 relief appearances to go along with this, his only career start. Percival worked an inning before being relieved by Kip Wells, a pitcher for whom 219 of his 296 career appearances were as a starter.\nIn the 21st century, baseball writers advanced the idea that starting pitchers are less effective against the opposing team's hitters the more times in a game they face them. Dave Fleming, a writer for Bill James Online, wrote in 2009 about a proposed \"3-3-3 rotation\" where pitchers would be limited to throwing three innings in a game. Bryan Grosnick, writing for SB Nation's \"Beyond the Box Score\", suggested using an opening pitcher for an inning or two before giving way to a more traditional starting pitcher in a 2013 article. In his 2016 book, \"Ahead of the Curve\", Brian Kenny suggested the possible use of an opening pitcher, noting that the highest scoring inning is typically the first inning, so a team should use a relief pitcher to shut down the top of the opposing team's batting order.\n2018 MLB season.\nThe Tampa Bay Rays began experimenting with an opener during the 2018 season, first utilizing the strategy on May 19. The first pitcher they chose to deploy as the opener was Sergio Romo, a veteran who has served as a closer. Romo pitched in the role again on May 22 and 23. The Rays returned Romo to their closer role in June, and they continued to use an opener, primarily turning to Ryne Stanek, Diego Castillo and Hunter Wood for the role, regularly using Ryan Yarbrough, Yonny Chirinos, and Jalen Beeks in immediate relief of the opener. The Rays saw their team earned run average (ERA) decrease after beginning to use the strategy. The Rays' openers recorded a 3.97 ERA in a combined 93 innings pitched, which bested the league average ERA of 4.15. During the summer, the Rays also experimented with an opener in their Double-A and Triple-A affiliates.\nIn June, the Los Angeles Dodgers used Scott Alexander as an opener due to injuries in their starting rotation. The Minnesota Twins, Oakland Athletics, and Texas Rangers also employed openers in the last month of the 2018 season. In the nine games in which the Athletics used the opener strategy in September (with Liam Hendriks serving as opener in eight of those games), they posted a win–loss record of 4–5 and a 1.86 ERA. The Athletics also chose to use Hendriks as the opener, unsuccessfully, in the 2018 American League Wild Card Game. In the 2018 National League Championship Series, the Milwaukee Brewers used starter Wade Miley as an opener in Game 5. He pitched to only one batter before being replaced, becoming just the second pitcher in MLB playoff history to start a game and face only one batter.\nWhen Farhan Zaidi became general manager of the San Francisco Giants after the 2018 season, he spoke about using an opener to protect Dereck Rodriguez and Andrew Suarez from being overworked.\n2019 MLB season.\nThe Tampa Bay Rays continued to use an opener in many of their games, with Ryne Stanek often filling the role. However, interest and usage in the opener strategy was far less pronounced than the season previous. The New York Yankees coped with having three of their starting pitchers on the injured list by using reliever Chad Green as an opener. Green would pitch the first inning or two and then hand over the game to a long reliever. During the 2019 regular season, Green opened 15 games for the Yankees; the Yankees won 11 of the games that he started. The Los Angeles Angels pitched a no-hitter using an opener, with Taylor Cole working the first two innings and Félix Peña the last seven in their 13–0 no-hitter against the Seattle Mariners on July 12.\nAdvantages.\nOne advantage of the strategy is that the opener, who is often a hard-throwing specialist, can be called in to face the most dangerous hitters, who are usually near the top of the batting order, the first time they come to bat. If the opener is successful, the job of the next pitcher is easier since they will start with less-dangerous hitters. The strategy also throws off the timing of the top-of-the-order hitters, who are not used to seeing different pitchers each time they come to bat, and allows the usual starting pitcher to face the top of the lineup two times rather than three.\nFrom a financial perspective, the strategy allows teams to make more use of relief pitchers who are still under low-paying contracts, potentially reducing the salaries paid to starting pitchers because the latter are used less. Also, pitchers not starting games causes them to be less likely to receive win–loss decisions or receive as many \"games started,\" which greatly affects subsequent arbitration hearings and financial compensation in future contract negotiations."

The second was the Polynesian Cup between Samoa and Tonga.\nResults.\nMelanesian Cup.\nOn 24 December 2014 it was announced that Papua New Guinea would play Fiji and Samoa would play Tonga as part of a 2015 Pacific test double header. The 2015 Melanesian Cup was played between Papua New Guinea and Fiji.\nWith a half-time lead of 18 points, Fiji beat Papua New Guinea to win the Melanesian Cup title by score of 22–10. Fiji's Marika Koroibete won the player of the match award, scoring 2 tries. Papua New Guinea has not won a test-match on away soil since the 2000 Rugby League World Cup.\nFiji picked 6 débutantes for the test match, while Papua New Guinea also featured six players making their first ever International appearance. Both teams had NRL, Queensland or New South Wales Cup, and domestic club players. Papua New Guinea's most experienced players were Nene MacDonald, Ray Thompson, and Tyson Martin making their 4th appearance, while Fiji's most experienced player was captain Jason Bukuya making his 10th appearance.\nPapua New Guinea Hunters' Israel Eliab captained his team, and Cronulla's Jason Bukuya led Fiji.\nPolynesian Cup.\nOn 24 December 2014 it was announced that Papua New Guinea would play Fiji and Samoa would play Tonga in the 2015 Pacific test double header. The 2015 Polynesian Cup was played between Samoa and Tonga.\nSamoa beat Tonga to win the Polynesian Cup title. No more than a 6-point margin separated the teams throughout the game. In the 77th minute a try-saving tackle was made on Tonga's Jorge Tafua. He attempted to dive into the corner to score his hat-trick only to be knocked into touch with a hit by Samoan forward Sam Kasiano. The Samoans won the game, 18–16.\nSamoa picked two débutantes for the test match, while Tonga featured four. Both teams' players were National Rugby League-based players except for Samoa's Michael Sio, who plays for Queensland Cup team Mackay Cutters. Samoa's most capped player was Daniel Vidot who made his 10th appearance, while Tonga's most experienced player was Richard Fa'aoso who also made his 10th appearance.\nANZAC Test.\nThe 2015 Anzac Test was a rugby league test match played between Australia and New Zealand at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane. It was the 16th Anzac Test played between the two nations under the Super League banner since 1997. Both sides were announced on 26 April. The game was originally scheduled to take place on 1 May, but it was postponed due to weather until May 3.\n2017 Rugby League World Cup qualification – Asia-Pacific play-off.\nOn October 17, Tonga had a one-off battle with the Cook Islands in the Asia-Pacific qualifying playoff for the 2017 Rugby League World Cup. The Tongans only led by 4 at the break before running away in the second half scoring 3 tries in the last 20 minutes of the game.\nBefore the game Tongan coach, Kristian Woolf, noted how players eligible for second-tier nations such as Tonga and Samoa were punished if they pursued an opportunity with an Australian or New Zealand Test or Origin squad. He made the complaint after Tongan internationals Sio Siua Taukeiaho and Tuimoala Lolohea played for the Kiwis in their end-of-year test series against England. Now, Tonga can't pick these two players until a 2-year period has passed. Woolf said \"Some flexibility in those rules would certainly help in terms of helping your tier two nations becoming more competitive with your first-tier nations.\""

The head coach was John \"Snooks\" Kelley and the team captain was Bernie Burke. The team won the 1949 NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. The team's leading scorer was Jack Mulhern, who finished second in the NCAA in both goals (34) and points (65)\nSeason.\nBoston College, looking to return to the tournament and improve upon their overtime loss in the semifinal the year before, opened the 1948–49 season with a 13–5 win over MIT. In January they welcomed fellow tournament hopeful Colorado College for one game and took the close match 6–5, improving their record to 7–0. less than a month later they met the other eastern tournament team, Dartmouth, and lost their first game 2–4 in Hanover. They would make up for that win a month later by defeating the Indians at home. BC finished the regular season 17–1, never having to leave New England and only playing three game outside of the state and one other outside the greater Boston area.\nIn March the Eagles played two tournaments. The first was the NEIHL Tournament (a precursor to the Beanpot) where they won two narrow victories over Northeastern and Boston University to win the championship. With a 19–1 record Boston College received the top eastern seed and played Colorado College in the first round of the NCAA Tournament The Eagles won the game handily, scoring seven against the Tigers to earn their right to the play for the title. The championship game was a rubber match for BC and Dartmouth and for their third meeting the two teams did not disappoint. The game had three lead changes before Jim Fitzgerald put the Eagles ahead for good in the third period and Boston College won the title 4–3.\nThis was the last BC team to win an ice hockey championship for 52 years. This was the first team to win a national title where all players were born in the same state or province. The 1949 national title game was the first one held between two eastern teams, the next time two eastern teams would meet in the final game was in 1967.\nNote: While BC was a member of the NEIHL, the conference was not officially recognized by the NCAA and the Eagles were technically an independent program.\nStandings.\nSchedule.\nDuring the season Boston College compiled a 21–1 record. By winning the national title the team set a record for the fewest losses by a national champion that would stand until 1970. Their schedule was as follows.\n1949 national championship.\n(E1) Boston College vs. (E2) Dartmouth.\nButch Songin and Jack Mulhern were named to the All-Tournament First Team while Bernie Burke made the Second Team"

        "text": "The men's vault (or \"horse vault\" or \"long horse\") competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics was held at the Waldbühne on 10 August. It was the sixth appearance of the event. There were 110 competitors from 14 nations, with each nation sending a team of up to 8 men. The event was won by Alfred Schwarzmann of Germany, the nation's first victory in the event since 1896 and second overall. Eugen Mack of Switzerland earned silver, the first man to win multiple medals in the event (he had won gold in 1928). Another member of the host German team, Matthias Volz, took bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the sixth appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Four of the 10 gymnasts from 1932 returned: gold medalist Savino Guglielmetti of Italy, silver medalist Al Jochim of the United States, fourth-place finisher Einari Teräsvirta of Finland, sixth-place finisher István Pelle of Hungary, seventh-place finisher Miklós Péter of Hungary, and tenth-place finisher Heikki Savolainen of Finland. Also returning was 1928 gold medalist Eugen Mack of Switzerland, who had also won the first world championship in the apparatus in 1934. Alfred Schwarzmann of host Germany was among the favorites as well.\nAustria, Japan, and Romania each made their debut in the men's vault. The United States made its fifth appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics format returned to the aggregation format used in 1928 but not in 1932. The event used a \"vaulting horse\" aligned parallel to the gymnast's run (rather than the modern \"vaulting table\" in use since 2004). Each nation entered a team of eight gymnasts (Bulgaria had only 7). All entrants in the gymnastics competitions (Neri of Italy did not compete in the vault) performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise, with the scores summed to give a final total. Two vaults were done for each, with the better score counted. The scores in the vault were added to the other apparatus scores to give individual all-around scores; the top six individual scores on each team were summed to give a team all-around score. No separate finals were contested.\nThe compulsory vault was described in the Official Report:"

The Orioles selected Means in the 11th round of the 2014 MLB draft. He made his MLB debut in 2018.\nMeans was an All-Star in 2019. He threw the tenth no-hitter in Orioles franchise history on May 5, 2021.\nCareer.\nAmateur and minor league career.\nMeans attended Gardner Edgerton High School in Gardner, Kansas. He played for the school's baseball team, but was not recruited by any NCAA Division I college baseball program. The Atlanta Braves selected him in the 46th round of the 2011 MLB draft. He intended to sign with the Braves, but was injured when a Braves scout visited him, and the scout recommended he go to college. Means enrolled at Fort Scott Community College and played baseball at the junior college level for one year, before he transferred to West Virginia University to play for the West Virginia Mountaineers. In 2013, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League. In 2014, his junior year at West Virginia, he went 6–2 with a 3.13 ERA in 12 starts.\nThe Orioles selected Means in the 11th round, with the 331st overall selection, of the 2014 MLB draft. He pitched for the Delmarva Shorebirds of the Single–A South Atlantic League in 2015. He threw a no-hitter for Delmarva in July. He pitched for the Frederick Keys of the High–A Carolina League in 2016, before receiving a midseason promotion to the Bowie Baysox of the Double–A Eastern League. He returned to Bowie in 2017. In 2018, he was promoted to the Norfolk Tides of the Triple–A International League.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nThe Orioles promoted Means to the major leagues on September 24, 2018. After a competition in spring training, the Orioles named Means to the team's Opening Day roster as a relief pitcher for the 2019 season. After three appearances out of the bullpen, pitching to a 1.59 ERA in 5 innings, Means was moved into the Orioles' starting rotation.\nOn June 28, 2019, Means was selected to his first All-Star Game, his 2.50 ERA ranking second among American League pitchers for the first half of the season. Starting 27 of 31 pitching appearances, he completed his rookie campaign at 12–11 with a 3.60 ERA. He finished second in American League Rookie of the Year voting. In the 2020 season, which was shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic, Means pitched to a 4.53 ERA, 42 strikeouts and a 2–4 record over innings pitched in 10 games pitched, all starts.\nThe Orioles selected Means as their Opening Day starting pitcher for the 2021 season. On May 5, 2021, he threw a no-hitter against the Seattle Mariners, striking out 12 batters while facing the minimum of 27 batters. His only baserunner, Sam Haggerty, reached on a dropped third strike in the third inning and was subsequently caught trying to steal second base. It was the first no-hitter for the Orioles since 1991 and the first solo no-hitter since Jim Palmer no-hit the Oakland Athletics on August 13, 1969. It was also the first no-hitter in MLB history where the only baserunner reached base on an uncaught third strike. On May 10, Means was named the AL Player of the Week for week of May 3 to May 9. On June 6, Means went onto the 10-day injured list with a strained shoulder. Means was activated on July 20, after missing over a month of action.\nMeans was named the Opening Day starter for the 2022 season, and pitched on April 7 against the Tampa Bay Rays. On April 13, Means pitched four innings against the Milwaukee Brewers before his removal from the game. He was diagnosed with elbow strain two days later and placed on the 10-day injured list. Means was transferred to the 60-day IL on April 17. Doctors determined that Means needed Tommy John surgery, which prematurely ended his 2022 season. He underwent surgery on May 11, 2022. On May 21, Means agreed to a two-year, $5.925 million contract with the Orioles to avoid arbitration.\nMeans spent the majority of the 2023 season rehabilitating from surgery. The Orioles activated him from the injured list on September 12, 2023, and he pitched the first five innings in a 5–2 home loss to the St. Louis Cardinals later that same night. Means earned his first win in two years two starts later in a 2–1 away victory over the Cleveland Guardians on September 23 in which he pitched innings including the first without allowing a hit.\nPersonal life.\nMeans' father Alan worked with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters for more than 30 years. Alan was the Local 41 (Kansas City, Missouri) Secretary/Treasurer just before his death from pancreatic cancer at age 57 on August 5, 2020. His younger brother Jake played college baseball at Indiana State University before being selected by the Kansas City Royals in the 22nd round (475th overall) of the 2019 Major League Baseball Draft.\nMeans is married to former professional soccer player Caroline Stanley.

Each set of fixtures was planned to take place as a tri-series.\nScotland, Nepal and the United Arab Emirates were joined by the top four teams from the 2019 ICC World Cricket League Division Two tournament. Round 1 was played in Aberdeen, Scotland in August 2019.\nThe league table combined both the qualification for the 2023 World Cup with the system of promotion and relegation for the following editions of the various Cricket leagues. For qualification to the World Cup, the top three teams advanced directly to the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier tournament, while the bottom four teams were sent to the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier Play-off. In that Play-off those bottom four teams were joined by the top two teams from the Challenge League, with the top two teams from that Play-off advancing to the Qualifier Tournament.\nFor promotion, it was originally intended that the top ranked team in this CWC League 2 would gain the opportunity to be promoted to the 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League if it finished higher than the 13th-placed Super League team at the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. However, in November 2021, the ICC announced that there would not be a second edition of the Super League, guaranteeing that Scotland would remain in the next League 2.\nFor relegation, United Arab Emirates and Papua New Guinea finished 6th and 7th, respectively. As a result, the Play-off tournament for them not only determined qualification for the World Cup, but also whether or not they would be relegated to the Challenge League. Among the six teams in that Play-off, the two teams among the United Arab Emirates, Papua New Guinea, Canada and Jersey (who had finished in the top two of the Challenge League), would qualify for the next edition of League 2. For the teams that finished 4th and 5th, Namibia and The United States, the play-off would determine only their World Cup qualification—even last place finishes for those teams would not result in relegation.\nScotland secured first place in the league on 15 February 2023 with a 10-wicket win against Namibia. They were presented with the trophy at the end of round 19 of the tournament in Kirtipur. Oman and Nepal finished in second and third, respectively, with Nepal winning 11 of their final 12 matches to pass Namibia in the final match of the tournament and secure a place in the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier tournament.\nTeams.\nThe top three teams in the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 qualified for the World Cup Qualifier while the bottom four went to the Qualifier Play-off.\nFixtures.\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed the following schedule of fixtures. In December 2020, the ICC announced a revised schedule following the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2022, the ICC issued a further update for rounds 9 to 15, with those rounds scheduled to take place from March to August 2022.\nAs originally planned, each team would host three tri-series, each time joined by a different two of the other six teams. Each tri-series would comprise six matches (two between each pair of teams). Therefore, over the course of the whole tournament, each team would play each other team twice at home, twice away, and twice at a neutral venue. Some matches had to be rescheduled for different times and venues (see below), so this original schedule did not happen fully as planned, but each team did play a total of six fixtures against each other team.\nAlterations.\nTwo of Oman's home matches were cancelled during round 4, and they were ultimately played as part of a home bilateral series (against the UAE in February 2022) and as an additional game (against Namibia) in round 9 in the UAE.\nOn 13 March 2020, round 6, scheduled to take place in Lauderhill, Florida in April 2020, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions to the United States. On 24 March 2020, the ICC also confirmed that rounds 7 and 8, scheduled to take place in Namibia and Papua New Guinea respectively, had also been postponed. Round 9, scheduled to take place in Scotland in July 2020, was postponed on 10 June 2020. Round 10, scheduled to take place in Namibia in September 2020, was postponed on 23 July 2020.\nIn February 2021, the ICC confirmed that (newly numbered) rounds 6, 7, and 8 of their updated schedule had also been postponed. Round 6 was scheduled to take place in Oman, with rounds 7 and 8 originally scheduled to be played in Papua New Guinea. Round 8 was rescheduled to take place in Namibia during November and December 2021. However, only two matches were played before the remaining fixtures were postponed due to the discovery of a new variant of COVID-19 in Southern Africa.\nIn February 2022, Oman and the UAE played a three-match bilateral series in Oman to make up for games that had been postponed during the earlier tri-series in Oman and Namibia. In April 2022, Papua New Guinea's home tri-series against Oman and Scotland (round 11) was played in the UAE. In February 2023, the UAE hosted Namibia for a two-match bilateral series to make up for games that had been postponed during round 8 in Namibia. The UAE hosted two tri-series against Nepal and Papua New Guinea (rounds 10 and 20), including one that would originally have been played in Papua New Guinea.\nResults.\nResults from the home and away matches are as follows:\nResults from the neutral venue matches are as follows:"

The Challenge League replaced the World Cricket League (WCL) which was previously used as the pathway to the Cricket World Cup. The first fixtures took place in September 2019, with all matches having List A status.\nThe league featured the twelve teams ranked from 21st to 32nd place in the WCL following the conclusion of the 2019 ICC World Cricket League Division Two tournament in Namibia. The twelve teams were split into two groups, with each group playing a six-team tournament three times on an annual basis.\nThe top team in each group advanced to the Qualifier Play-off, which fed into the 2022 Cricket World Cup Qualifier tournament. The remaining ten teams could not qualify for the 2023 World Cup.\nIn addition, either of the top teams in the Challenge League could qualify for promotion to the next edition of the Cricket World Cup League 2 by outperforming the two last-placed teams in the 2019–22 ICC Cricket World Cup League 2. Whichever two of these four teams were ranked higher in the Qualifier Play-off played in the next League 2 while the two teams ranked lower played in the next Challenge League.\nIn an attempt to remain in the Challenge League for the next edition, the bottom four teams in this League (two from each section, A and B) would play in a relegation play-off tournament - facing teams hoping to come up from below.\nParticipants.\nThe following teams were ranked from 21st to 32nd in the World Cricket League following the conclusion of the 2019 ICC World Cricket League Division Two tournament, and were allocated to Groups A and B.\nFixtures.\nEach group was scheduled to play three times in a single round-robin tournament format, once each year from 2019 to 2022. This amounts to 15 matches per team and a grand total of 90 matches. In July 2019, the International Cricket Council (ICC) announced that the Malaysian Cricket Association and Cricket Hong Kong would host the 2019 rounds of the tournament. However, citing the instability in Hong Kong, the 2019 matches in League B were moved to Oman. In October 2019, the ICC confirmed that Malaysia would again be the host for the 2020 round of matches in League A, with the Uganda Cricket Association hosting the League B matches.\nThe 2020 League A tournament in Malaysia was originally scheduled to take place in March 2020. However, in March 2020, the tournament was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and rescheduled for 30 September to 10 October 2020. On 10 June 2020, the 2020 League B tournament in Uganda was also postponed due to the pandemic. On 25 August 2020, the rescheduled 2020 League A tournament was postponed again. In December 2020, the ICC announced a revised schedule following the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2021, the League A tournament in Canada was postponed by one year, with the League A tournament in Malaysia tentatively brought forward to the end of 2021. In July 2021, the League B tournament scheduled to take place in Jersey in September 2021, was tentatively rescheduled to take place in Hong Kong in December 2021."

Twelve teams are divided into two groups of six and each group plays a triple round robin. The top ranked team of each group advances to the World Cup Qualifier Play-off. For a Challenge League team to qualify for the World Cup, they must, in succession, top their Challenge League group, achieve a top-two finish in the World Cup Qualifier Play-off and achieve a top-two finish in the World Cup Qualifier.\nPromotion and relegation.\nA system of promotion and relegation exists between the Challenge League and ICC Cricket World Cup League 2. In the World Cup Qualifier Play-off, the bottom two teams from League 2 and the two champions of the Challenge League could change leagues depending on their results. Of the four teams, the two teams ranked higher will play in the next League 2, while the two teams ranked lower will play in the next Challenge League.\nThe bottom four teams from the Challenge League are also at risk of dropping out of the 32-team qualification system entirely. They play in the World Cup Challenge Play-off with four other teams from outside the system. Of the eight participants, only the top four teams will play in the next Challenge League."

At the end of the season an overall ranking was determined based upon points, which athletes were awarded for finishing in the top 30 of each individual event.\nThe winners for bouldering were Jernej Kruder and Miho Nonaka, for lead Jakob Schubert and Janja Garnbret, for speed Bassa Mawem and Anouck Jaubert, and for combined Jakob Schubert and Janja Garnbret, men and women respectively.\nThe National Team for bouldering was Japan, for lead Austria, and for speed Russian Federation.\nHighlights of the season.\nIn bouldering, at the World Cup in Munich, Janja Garnbret of Slovenia flashed all boulders in the final round to take the win.\nMiho Nonaka and Akiyo Noguchi, both of Japan, were the only athletes who never missed a podium in all 7 bouldering competitions in the season.\nIn lead climbing, Janja Garnbret was the only athlete who never missed a podium in all 7 lead competitions in the season.\nIn speed climbing, at the first Speed World Cup of the season in Moscow, Anouck Jaubert of France matched the world record of 7.32 seconds set by Iuliia Kaplina of Russia at the 2017 World Games in Wrocław. Then at the end of the season, French athletes, Bassa Mawem and Anouck Jaubert clinched the overall titles of the season for men and women respectively, making it double speed titles for France.\nChanges from the previous season.\nFor the 2018 season the IFSC changed the scoring method for its tournaments. Previously in bouldering, topped boulders were the deciding factor, followed as tiebreakers in decreasing order of importance: attempts to tops, bonus holds (renamed to \"zones\"), and attempts to bonus holds.

        "title": "Chris Dawson (rugby league)",
        "text": "Christopher Michael Dawson (born 26 July 1948) is an Australian convicted murderer and sex offender, and a former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1970s.\nFollowing the 1982 disappearance of his wife, Lynette, and two separate coronial inquests, the NSW Coroner determined that Lynette Dawson was dead and that her most likely murderer was her husband, Chris. After many years of stalled and failed investigations, Dawson was arrested and charged with murder in December 2018, then 2 weeks later he was granted bail after he paid the court A$1.5 million, he was forced to surrender his passport to Queensland police and to live with his current wife. His trial started on 9 May 2022 in the NSW Supreme Court. In 2022, Dawson was found guilty of murdering Lynette, and was sentenced to 24 years in prison.\nHe is currently incarcerated at Long Bay Correctional Centre.\nEarly life.\nDawson was born in Sydney, New South Wales. He is the second born of twins; his twin brother is Paul who was also a professional rugby league player and he has an older brother, Peter. Dawson attended Sydney Boys High School where he was a prefect. He graduated in 1966.\nDawson met Lynette Simms at a high school function in 1965, when they were both aged sixteen. They married in 1970 at St Jude's Church, Randwick, and later had two daughters.\nRugby career.\nBoth Chris and Paul played rugby union for Eastern Suburbs.\nThe Dawson brothers switched codes to play rugby league for the Newtown Jets in 1972. Chris Dawson played in the second row along with Paul for the Newtown Jets club for five seasons. The Dawson brothers were part of the 1973 New South Wales Rugby League Club Championship winning team.\nSubsequent career.\nAfter their rugby careers finished, both Chris and Paul Dawson became physical education teachers at public high schools on the Northern Beaches and North Shore of Sydney. Dawson was teaching at Cromer High School in 1980 when he commenced a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old pupil, Joanne Curtis, while he was married to Lynette Dawson.\nThe Dawson brothers and families moved to Queensland in 1985. Chris Dawson worked at Keebra Park State High School first then later moved to Coombabah State High School to work with his brother Paul.\nIn 2003 Dawson was working at St Ursula's College in Yeppoon, Queensland before being fired from his job during the 2003 coronial inquest on Lynette's death . \nCriminal convictions.\nWife's murder.\nDawson's wife Lynette went missing in January 1982. Two days after Lynette's disappearance, Dawson invited Joanne Curtis to move into the family house. He reported his wife missing on 18 February 1982, six weeks after her disappearance, claiming she had left after marital problems and had joined a commune. He finalised divorce proceedings against Lynette in 1983.\nDawson married Joanne Curtis in 1984. The couple divorced in 1993.\nLynette's body has never been found but two coronial inquests were conducted in 2001 and 2003 with both ruling that Lynette Dawson must be dead and was most likely murdered by a known person.\nDawson was the main subject of an investigative podcast series, \"The Teacher's Pet\", by journalist Hedley Thomas. Thomas investigated allegations about the disappearance of Lynette and brought Dawson into renewed public and media focus through the podcast's broadcast in 2018. , the Gold Walkley-award-winning podcast was downloaded 28 million times. The series was temporarily removed from download in Australia in April 2019, \"to help ensure that Chris Dawson gets a fair trial\".\nOn 5 December 2018, Dawson was arrested by detectives from Queensland Police for the murder of Lynette Dawson. He was extradited to New South Wales on 6 December 2018 to face trial. In his appearance at Sydney's Central Local Court that day, he was refused bail and was remanded in custody. On 17 December 2018, Dawson was granted bail and his family paid A$1.5 million bail for him to be released. Appearing in the NSW Local Court in June 2019, Dawson pleaded not guilty to the murder of Lynette Dawson. In February 2020, Dawson was committed to stand trial for the murder of Lynette. His arraignment was set for April, with a potential trial date later in 2020.\nOn 30 August 2022, Dawson was found guilty of murdering Lynette in 1982, after a judge only trial in the Supreme Court of New South Wales.\nOn 2 December 2022, Dawson was sentenced to 24 years in jail, with a non-parole period of 18 years, for the murder of Lynette.\nCarnal knowledge of a student.\nIn May 2023, Dawson faced charges related to carnal knowledge (a historical offence replaced in 1986) of a student in his class, known for the purposes of the trial as \"AB\". In a judge-only trial, he was found guilty by judge Sarah Huggett on 28 June 2023. On 15 September 2023, he was sentenced to imprisonment for three years, with a non-parole period of two years, with the sentence to begin in August 2039 after the completion of his murder sentence.\nIn September 2023, Dawson's victim, launched a civil case in the NSW Supreme Court against the NSW Department of Education for negligence, claiming it breached its duty of care to her, failed to investigate Dawson, and allowed him to remain a teacher at the school “notwithstanding the common knowledge that he was sexually abusing a pupil”.

        "title": "Premier Lacrosse League",
        "text": "Premier Lacrosse League (PLL) is an American professional field lacrosse league composed of 8 teams. The league's inaugural season debuted on June 1, 2019, and included a 14-week tour-based schedule taking place in 12 major-market cities. The league was founded by the American professional lacrosse player Paul Rabil and his brother Mike Rabil. Investors include The Chernin Group, The Raine Group and Joe Tsai.\nHistory.\nIn September 2018, Bloomberg reported that Paul Rabil would be launching a new professional lacrosse league. The PLL would be a direct competitor to the more established Major League Lacrosse. The new league will provide professional lacrosse players with salaries, health care, and league equity. By October 2018, 140 players had been signed by the PLL. Of the 140 players are 86 All-Americans, 25 members of the U.S. national team, and 10 former Tewaaraton Award winners. By December the league had signed 17 additional players. For the League's inaugural season, the PLL had the 6 founding teams draft a player in each of the 4 rounds. For the first round there was a random draw and the reverse the order every round. Archers had the first draft pick in the newly formed league, taking Pat Spencer making him the first player ever drafted in the PLL.\nAs opposed to tying teams to a specific market, the league's first season toured 12 different \"major market cities\". The season included 14 weeks, comprising 10 regular-season weekends, 1 all-star weekend, and 3 playoff weekends, running from June 1 through September 21, assuring there was no overlap with the NCAA Lacrosse season or the National Lacrosse League regular season. Paul Rabil first hinted at expansion in a post game interview after the 2019 Championship game and on January 1, 2020, the Premier Lacrosse League announced the Waterdogs Lacrosse Club's admission into the league. An expansion draft took place on February 12 and an entry draft occurred on March 16 to build the new roster with veteran players. \nOn December 16, 2020, it was announced that the PLL and MLL had merged under the banner of the PLL. The PLL would add the Boston Cannons for the 2021 season, rebranded as the Cannons Lacrosse Club, to bring the total PLL teams to eight. Small tweaks to the former Boston Cannons branding resulted in a PLL crest and logo reveal on January 12, 2021. In July 2022, Ticketmaster tracked a 38% growth in tickets purchased and attendance. The PLL also announced the approved Series D round of funding for the league which was being led by return investor The Chernin Group (TCG). Other investors include Blue Pool Capitol, Brett Jefferson, WWE, 35V, Kevin Durant, Rich Klieman, Wheelhouse Entertainment, and Pomp Investments.\nOn May 25, 2023 it was announced that the PLL would be assigning home cities to teams beginning with the 2024 season. Voting for the finalists began on June 3, 2023, and the 26 finalists were announced during the 2023 PLL All-Star game. The finalists were selected through a mix of fan-voting, customer data, ticketing performance, and venue availability. The PLL also announced that they would not be moving away from the touring model. Teams will continue to play on ten regular season weekends, two of which will be played at neutral sites, the other eight of which will be hosted by one of the teams. On the weekend a team hosts, they will play a doubleheader. On November 14, the home cities were announced for each of the 8 teams; Chrome Lacrosse Club was replaced by the Denver Outlaws. Rabil envisions the league’s decision to affiliate teams with geographic areas as the 2nd of three potential phases in the PLL’s expansion as it continues to capture the attention and viewership of casual fans. Rabil mentioned Phase 3 could become traditional home-and-away schedule like MLL, and the PLL owning venues in each of these markets.\nFormat and rules.\nThe PLL regular season consists of 10-weekends where games are played. Halfway through the season there is an all-star break where the exhibition all-star game is played as well as other all-star skills challenges. The PLL utilizes a touring model and plays at a different location each weekend. Prior to the 2023 PLL season it was announced that the PLL would be assigning home cities to teams while still utilizing the touring model. Each team will host one weekend where they play a doubleheader. The remaining two weekends will be played at a neutral site. The PLL postseason consists of a 7-team single elimination tournament. Only one team does not qualify for the postseason. The top-seed receives a bye into the semifinals. All three quarterfinals games are played on the same day at the same location. The same is true for the semifinals.\nThe PLL has a variety of major rule differences compared to traditional field lacrosse:\nTeams.\nAs of the 2024 season, eight clubs with rosters of 25 players each compete in the Premier Lacrosse League, divided equally into two conferences. The Eastern Conference consists of the Boston Cannons, Maryland Whipsnakes, New York Atlas and Philadelphia Waterdogs, while the Western Conference consists of the California Redwoods, Carolina Chaos, Denver Outlaws and Utah Archers. Six of the current teams have competed in the league continuously since the inaugural 2019 season. The Waterdogs were admitted as an expansion team in the 2020 season, while the Cannons moved from Major League Lacrosse (MLL) and began play in the 2021 season. The Cannons were the only MLL club to survive the MLL–PLL merger, though the Outlaws, originally founded as the Chrome Lacrosse Club, adopted the identity of the MLL's Denver Outlaws. The Maryland Whipsnakes are the most successful franchise, having won two championships and finished runners-up once. The Archers, Chaos and Waterdogs have each won one championship. The Redwoods finished runners-up once, while neither the Atlas, Cannons or Outlaws have yet appeared in a PLL Championship game.\nA college draft is held prior to the season each year, in addition to expansion drafts when necessary. The college draft order is determined via regular season standings with the team that was in last place the previous season receiving the number one overall pick. As of 2023, the each PLL team has a salary cap of $735,000 which they must allocate at least 98% of each year, The minimum salary for each player is $25,000, this leaves around $100,000 to be allocated by each team over the minimum. The average PLL salary has been estimated at $28,000, although the league itself does not release the number. All players selected in the PLL college draft are given three-year contracts, all but the top-four selections are given $25,000. The first overall pick receives $30,000, second overall receives $28,500, third overall receives $27,500, and fourth overall receives $26,000. Prior to the beginning of the season the PLL hosts a \"training-camp\" where each team begins with a 30-man roster. By the end of training camp each team is required to have a 25-man roster. Training camp consists of individual and multi-team practices, as well as scrimmages between the teams.\nThe first free agency period for the PLL took place prior to the 2023 PLL season from March 6, 2023 to April 1, 2023. Following the PLL season, players are given the opportunity to opt out of their current contract if they were on the active roster (21-man roster) for less than 30% of games the previous season. If that player does not sign with another club by the end of the free agency period, they return to their original team. If a player has not appeared on a team's 21-man active roster for three consecutive weeks the player was eligible to play, the player may be claimed by any team. When a player is released by their club, they enter the player pool; other teams will have one week to claim the player before the player enters free agency.\nTimeline\nVenues.\nFrom 2019 to 2024, the league used a touring model only spending a week in each city. In 2020, the entire original schedule was scrapped due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the season was then restructured to have every game take place at Zions Bank Stadium in Herriman, Utah. The PLL will be assigning home cities to teams beginning with the 2024 season.\nAccolades.\nOn February 15, 2022, the Premier Lacrosse League announced the inaugural class of the Professional Lacrosse Hall of Fame. In order to be eligible for selection, a player must:\nUp until the creation of the Professional Lacrosse Hall of Fame there was no Hall of Fame for exclusively professional field lacrosse players. In February, 2023 Ryan Boyle was announced as the first member of the 2023 class. The remainder of the 2023 class was announced on March 23, 2023. \nMarketing.\nThe league's media model radically differs from that of most North American professional sports leagues. A 2018 \"Sports Illustrated\" story on the then-prospective league pointed out that LeBron James' Instagram account \"features virtually no clips of him playing basketball—those are the property of the NBA, meaning its owners.\" By contrast, the PLL open-sources its highlights, allowing players to freely use them to build their own personal brands. Additionally, PLL operates a full-time studio that produces other player-centered content.\nBroadcasting and sponsorship.\nThe Premier Lacrosse League was broadcast by NBCUniversal between 2019 and 2021, with select matches, including the All-Star Game and playoffs, airing on their NBC and NBCSN television networks.

It was recognised the following year by the International Olympic Committee. In 1973, its name was changed to the \"Belize\" Olympic and Commonwealth Games Association.\nThe Association's most recent elections were held on 18 February 2017, with Hilberto Martinez and Allan Sharp assuming office as President and Secretary General, respectively.\nActivities.\nThe Association is primarily responsible for funding athletes' training and travel to sporting competitions. In 2022, it commissioned the construction of Olympic House, which is partially meant to provide its affiliated sporting federations and athletes with office and training space.\nControversies.\nThe Association, deemed '[possibly] the most important sporting body in Belize,' has been criticised for defying 'every norm of democratic governance.' Its second President, Ned Pitts, held office 'for 42 years and did not face an open election in decades.' By 2013, it was claimed that 'no one can rightly recall when the last election was held.'"

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career fielding errors as a center fielder leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, an error is an act, in the judgment of the official scorer, of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a batter or baserunner to advance one or more bases or allows an at bat to continue after the batter should have been put out. The center fielder (CF) is one of the three outfielders, the defensive positions in baseball farthest from the batter. Center field is the area of the outfield directly in front of a person standing at home plate and facing beyond the pitcher's mound. The outfielders' duty is to try to catch long fly balls before they hit the ground or to quickly catch or retrieve and return to the infield any other balls entering the outfield. Generally having the most territory to cover, the center fielder is usually the fastest of the three outfielders, although this can also depend on the relative strength of their throwing arms and the configuration of their home field, due to the deepest part of center field being the farthest point from the infield and home plate. The center fielder normally plays behind the shortstop and second baseman, who play in or near the infield; unlike catchers and most infielders (excepting first basemen), who are virtually exclusively right-handed, center fielders can be either right- or left-handed. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the center fielder is assigned the number 8.\nThe list of career leaders is dominated by players from the early 20th century; only three of the top 25 players were active after 1953. Only nine of the top 71 single-season totals were recorded after 1927, only one after 1939; only five of the top 183 totals were recorded after 1964. To a large extent, the leaders reflect longevity rather than lower skill. Tris Speaker, who holds the modern (post-1900) record of 227 errors committed as a center fielder, is often regarded as the greatest outfielder in history, setting records for putouts and assists; Willie Mays, whose 139 errors are the most by a center fielder since 1930, won twelve Gold Glove Awards for defensive excellence.\nBecause game accounts and box scores often did not distinguish between the outfield positions, there has been some difficulty in determining precise defensive statistics prior to 1901; because of this, and because of the similarity in their roles, defensive statistics for the three positions are frequently combined. Although efforts to distinguish between the three positions regarding games played during this period and reconstruct the separate totals have been largely successful, separate error totals are unavailable; players whose totals are missing the figures for pre-1901 games are notated in the table below. Tris Speaker is the post-1900 leader in career errors committed as a center fielder with 227; Ty Cobb (208) is second, and is the only other center fielder to commit over 200 career errors. Lorenzo Cain, who had 39 errors through the 2022 season to place him tied for 130th all-time, is the leader among active players."

        "text": "The girls' individual archery event at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics was held from 12 to 16 October 2018 at the Parque Sarmiento in Buenos Aires, Argentina. One of three recurve archery events which comprised the archery programme, it was the third time the girls' individual discipline had been contested at Summer Youth Olympics. Thirty-two archers from thirty-two countries entered the competition, which was open to female archers born between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2003. The defending champion was China's Li Jiaman, who was unable to defend her title due to the age limitations imposed on the event.\nZhang Mengyao of China won the gold medal, becoming the second female Chinese archer to become Youth Olympic champion. Zhang defeated Spain's Elia Canales by six set points to two in the final, the Spaniard taking home the silver medal as the runner-up. Son Ye-ryeong of South Korea won the bronze medal ahead of Mexico's Valentina Vázquez Cadena.\nQualification.\nA total of thirty-two places were available for the event, with each National Olympic Committee (NOC) limited to one entry each. As host nation Argentina automatically qualified its sole entry. A tournament held in parallel with the 2017 World Youth Archery Championships was the primary method of qualification for the remaining thirty-one places, offering sixteen to the sixteen highest-placed athletes in the competition. Eleven places were awarded through five continental youth championships, with the European, Asian, and American championships each offering three spots and those of African and Oceania offering two and one places respectively. The final four positions were available as 'universality places', awarded to NOCs underrepresented at the Olympic Games in line with the universal representation ethos of the Olympic Charter.\nNational selections.\nEach NOC was free to select its representative for the event according to its own criteria, irrespective of the archer who won the position at any one of the qualifying tournaments. Many NOCs nevertheless chose the archers that won the qualifying place. Great Britain announced the selection of Alyssia Tromans-Ansell as part of its national squad in September 2018. Tromans-Ansell, who was coached by four-time Olympian Naomi Folkard and had switched from gymnastics aged 11 after a severe allergic reaction, had won the qualifying tournament held with the World Youth Archery Championships in 2017. 17-year old Himani was likewise chosen by India after her third-placed finish at the qualifying tournament, as was Spain's three-time national cadet champion Èlia Canales, who had finished in ninth. Rebecca Jones, who was inspired to take up archery by \"The Hunger Games\" series, was selected for New Zealand's national delegation in August 2018 following her qualification-winning performance at the World Archery Oceania Championships in New Caledonia.\nMexico chose 15-year old Valentina Vázquez Cadena for her third international tournament, Vázquez herself inspired to take up archery following the bronze medal victory of Mariana Avitia at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Laura van der Winkel, the winner of the 2018 Dutch national indoor championship at age sixteen, was entered by the Netherlands after she topped a national selection procedure held during the 2018 European Youth Championships.\nFormat.\nThe girls' individual recurve event was an outdoor recurve target archery event held according to World Archery-approved rules. From a distance of 60 metres each archer at a 122 cm-wide target, with between one and ten points being awarded for each arrow depending on how close it landed to the centre of the target. The competition took place over two days, an initial ranking round being followed by a single-elimination tournament consisting of five rounds. Two final matches determining the winners of the gold, silver, and bronze medals concluded the event.\nThe ranking round was held on 12 October and determined the seeds for the elimination rounds. Each of the thirty-two archers shot a total of 72 arrows, the archer scoring the highest total from her 72 arrows receiving the number one seed, the archer with the second highest total receiving second seed, and so on. In the event of a tie between two or more archers, the number of arrows shot in the central 10-ring of the target was taken into account, with the number of arrows shot within the inner-10 (or X) ring used as a second tiebreaker if necessary.\nThe format of the elimination and medal-deciding rounds followed the Archery Olympic Round set system. The elimination rounds began on 15 October with the 1/16 round and continued into the following day, 16 October, with the bronze and gold medal finals following afterwards. Each match consisted of a maximum of five sets, with archers each shooting three arrows per set. The archer with the greater score from their three arrows won the set, earning two set points. The archer with the lower score in each set received zero points. If the score was tied, each archer received one point. The first archer to reach six set points was declared the winner. If the match was tied at five set points each after the maximum five sets were played, a single tie-breaker arrow was used with the closest to centre of the target winning. In the event both archers shot into the central 10 ring in the first tiebreaker, a second single tie-breaker arrow was used.\nReport.\nRanking round.\nThe ranking round on 12 October was headed by China's Zhang Mengyao, who scored a personal best of 675 points – out of a maximum of 720 – from her 72 arrows to claim the top seed for the elimination rounds. Japan's Ruka Uehara finished second with 667 points ahead of third-placed Himani of India on 665 points. Speaking to the media afterwards, Zhang stated that although she was satisfied with her performance she was not going to enter the knockout rounds feeling complacent about having placing first.\nElimination rounds.\nNew Zealand's Rebecca Jones delivered an upset in the opening elimination round, held on 15 October, the thirty-first seed defeating second seed Uehara after a one arrow shoot-off was decided in Jones' favour. The 1/16 round also saw Tromans-Ansell mount a recovery over the Philippines' Nicole Tagle, coming from two sets down to win six set points to four. Tagle's defeat ended the Philippines' participation in the Games. Both Tromans-Ansell and Jones were eliminated by seventh seed Valentina Vázquez Cadena in the 1/8 and quarter-final rounds respectively, the Mexican reaching the semi-finals to face Spain's Elia Canales. Canales herself had finished eleventh in the ranking round with 645 points and showed improving form over the course of her three knockout matches, which included victory over sixth seed Clea Reisenweber of Germany, to progress to the semi-finals.\nZhang meanwhile averaged twenty-eight points per set in her journey to the gold medal final, comfortably defeating Mst Radia Akther Shapla of Bangladesh, Kazakhstan's Alexandra Voropayeva, and Myanmar's Pyae Sone Hnin to advance to the semi-finals. There she met fourth seed Son Ye-ryeong of South Korea, who had not conceded a single set in her three elimination round matches. Son led after three sets before Zhang outscored the Korean twice in succession to clinch the fourth and fifth sets and narrowly progress to the final.\nMedal matches.\nAs the two losing archers from the semi-finals, Vázquez Cadena and Son met to contest the bronze medal final. After three close sets — the pair each posting a twenty-seven and a pair of twenty-eight scores — Vázquez Cadena managed just twenty-three points from her three arrows in the fourth set. This drop in performance allowed Son to take the lead and break away, the South Korean claiming the fifth set soon afterwards to secure the bronze medal.\nIn the gold medal final Zhang and Canales started off the match on an equal footing, both scoring twenty-six points to tie the first set. A seven by Canales however allowed Zhang to take the second set, and after another tie in the third set Canales shot wide again into the seven ring again in the fourth. With a score of twenty-seven points to twenty-five Zhang clinched the set and secured the gold medal. Zhang's victory was China's second girls' individual gold medal in succession following Li Jiaman's victory at the previous Summer Youth Olympics. Canales' silver medal was the third achieved by Spain that day."

        "text": "Vikings Esports is a Vietnamese professional \"League of Legends\" team competing in the Vietnam Championship Series (VCS). It was founded in 2016 as Young Generation. The team was crowned VCS champions twice, and qualified for the World Championship in 2017, 2018, and 2022, as well as the Mid-Season Invitational in 2019 and 2022. Vikings Gaming acquired and rebranded the team from Saigon Buffalo to Viking Esports in 2023.\nHistory.\nOn 18 May 2018, Young Generation rebranded to Phong Vũ Buffalo after agreeing to a sponsorship deal with Phong Vũ, a major computer company in Vietnam. The team dominated in its first split in the VCS, losing only one series to EVOS Esports and one to GIGABYTE Marines, ending with a series record of 12 wins and 2 losses in the 2018 VCS Summer Split. This placement secured them a spot in finals of the VCS 2018 Summer Playoffs, where they defeated Cube Adonis 3–1 and qualified for the 2018 World Championship.\nBecause of EVOS Esports' placement at the 2018 Mid-Season Invitational, Vietnam was given a spot in the main event at the 2018 League of Legends World Championship, allowing Phong Vũ Buffalo to avoid the need to qualify through the play-in stage. For the group stage, Phong Vũ Buffalo was drawn into Group A, along with the Afreeca Freecs, the Flash Wolves, and G2 Esports. The team ended the group stage with 2 win and 4 losses, failing to qualify for the knockout stage.\nPhong Vũ Buffalo placed 1st in the 2019 VCS Spring Split regular season, with a record of 13 wins and 1 loss. This directly qualified the team for the finals, where they defeated EVOS Esports 3–1 to qualify for the 2019 Mid-Season Invitational as Vietnam's representative.\nPhong Vũ Buffalo was placed in Group A of the first round of the 2019 Mid-Season Invitational play-in stage, along with Turkish team 1907 Fenerbahçe, Australian team Bombers, and Argentine team Isurus Gaming. The team ended the group round robin with a record of 4 wins and 2 losses, tying 1907 Fenerbahçe for 1st and forcing a tiebreaker match, which 1907 Fenerbahçe lost. Phong Vũ Buffalo's victory qualified them for the second round of the play-in stage, where they lost 0–3 to Team Liquid. This result forced Phong Vũ Buffalo to play in a third round against Vega Squadron, who they defeated 3–2 in a close series, securing themselves a spot in the main event. Phong Vũ Buffalo placed last in the group stage of the main event with a 2–8 record, failing to advance to the knock-out stage.\nOn 31 May 2019, the organization announced it was renaming to Dashing Buffalo to reflect a change in its sponsorship, with Dashing Shampoo becoming its primary sponsor.\nDashing Buffalo renamed to Saigon Buffalo on 26 May 2020 to reflect its partnership with the Saigon Heat.\nIn November 2022, the South Korean esports-focused think tank JUEGO signed a deal to acquire Saigon Buffalo, but the deal fell through.\nSaigon Buffalo was renamed to Vikings Esports after the 2023 season.

        "title": "Wimbledon and Dorking Railway",
        "text": "The Wimbledon and Dorking Railway (W&amp;DR) was an early railway company in southern England. It was independently promoted with the intention of penetrating into West Sussex, but it only succeeded in getting authorisation as far as Epsom. It joined the Epsom and Leatherhead Railway there, and opened in 1859. \nIt was absorbed into the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) in 1862. It was electrified in 1925. \nToday it forms an important part of the Surrey commuter network \nHistory.\nCroydon and Epsom Railway.\nThe London and Croydon Railway was operational in 1839, and by means of an affiliated company, the Croydon and Epsom Railway, had powers granted on 29 July 1844 to reach Epsom. The London and Croydon Railway amalgamated with the London and Brighton Railway and the Croydon and Epsom Railway, as well as certain others, resulting in the formation of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR), by Act of 27 July 1846.\nThe Croydon and Epsom line opened to Epsom on 10 May 1847. The Epsom station was some way east of the present-day station, on the north side of Upper High Street.\nEpsom and Leatherhead Railway.\nOn 14 July 1856 the Epsom and Leatherhead Railway was authorised, with authorised share capital of £30,000. An independent short line, it had suffered antagonistic opposition in Parliament, which prevented it from extending at either end. The E&amp;LR had no large company sponsoring it, and its supporters were free to secure the support of the LBSCR or the LSWR. The E&amp;LR was completed on 1 February 1859 and worked by the LSWR. For a short time it was isolated from other railways.\nWimbledon and Dorking Railway.\nIndependent promoters put forward a Wimbledon and Dorking Railway, intended to extend the E&amp;LR at each end. It would leave the LSWR main line west of Wimbledon, and run to Epsom, and then from Leatherhead to Dorking. The first prospectus showed a connection at Dorking to the South Eastern Railway, which ran west to east between Guildford and Reigate. However the W&amp;DR Parliamentary Bill in the 1857 session applied only for the northern section, miles long. The Act was passed on 27 July 1857; the authorised share capital was £70.000. The LSWR had opposed at first, but was mollified by an agreement that it should work and maintain the line for forty-five per cent of gross receipts, taking £30,000 in shares and appointing two directors. \nThe LSWR had made a territorial exclusivity agreement several years previously: each agreed not to make or encourage lines that encroached into the other's natural territory, and when the E&amp;LR asked the LSWR to work its line, the LSWR primly refused. The W&amp;DR did not enter into the disputed territory, and was falling into the LSWR camp, but a proposed amalgamation of the W&amp;DR and the ELR would infringe the agreement, and the LSWR opposed an 1858 Bill proposing that amalgamation.\nThe W&amp;DR double line, surveyed by Crosse, was built by Thomas Brassey, though bad weather and scarcity of men and materials made him late with both. The W&amp;DR line was opened to traffic on 4 April 1859; the junction with the LSWR main line was named Epsom Junction, and was located at the site of the later Raynes Park station. Like the E&amp;LR, the line was worked by the LSWR.\nIn 1859 the W&amp;DR owning company made an alliance with the Epsom and Leatherhead Railway and the proposed Portsmouth Direct Railway, intending to extend from Leatherhead to Dorking, and ultimately Portsmouth via Chichester, but this project was turned down by Parliament in 1859. On 29 July 1859 the LBSCR reached an agreement settling further territorial disputes; part of the agreement left the LBSCR in sole possession of the area south of Leatherhead, and the aspirations of the W&amp;DR to extend in that direction were at an end.\nEpsom stations.\nOn 8 August 1859 the Epsom station of the LBSCR was connected to the E&amp;LR and LBSCR trains worked through on to that line. The Wimbledon line had a passenger train service of seven trains every weekday. \nAbsorption of the WDR.\nIn 1860 the W&amp;DR complained bitterly that its legitimate income was restricted because of diversion of traffic by the LBSCR. The LSWR decided it was time to buy out the W&amp;DR and made an offer, but it was turned down by W&amp;DR shareholders. The W&amp;DR had a short section of line at Epsom, which the LBSCR used to reach the E&amp;LR and the W&amp;DR started proceedings in the High Court to prevent the LBSCR using it. Further petulant measures followed, but at length it was obvious that the future involved a takeover by the LSWR, and this was agreed from 3 April 1861.\nThe LSWR absorbed the W&amp;DR by Act of 3 June 1862.\nTrain service.\nThe 1904 timetables show 22 down trains to Epsom.\nRaynes Park station and junction.\nA station opened at Epsom Junction, where the W&amp;DR converged with the LSWR main line. It was called Raynes Park, and its opening date was 30 October 1871. AT first it served only the Epsom line and the Kingston line. This was followed on 16 March 1884 by the commissioning of a burrowing junction there, by which the Up Epsom line was carried under the main lines to avoid conflicts.\nElectrification.\nSurrey's first section of the Southern Electric came into operation on 12 July 1925, running over the lines from Raynes Park to Epsom and Dorking. The third rail direct current system was used.\nChessington branch.\nMuch later the line was the basis for the Chessington branch from (itself a later addition) to . That was the last line built by the Southern Railway, opened on 28 May 1938 to and to Chessington South on 29 May 1939. The branch was originally planned to continue to Leatherhead with stations at Malden Rushett and Ashtead, but war intervened, and apart from some preliminary civil engineering west of Chessington South station the scheme was never built.\nPassenger train services.\nThe Raynes Park to Epsom line links the South West Main Line to several routes through Surrey. As of 2020 it is used for the following weekday off-peak services by South Western Railway from :\nEpsom also has Southern services from and , providing connections beyond Dorking to and back to Sutton and South London."

        "title": "2019 European Rugby Champions Cup final",
        "text": "The 2019 European Rugby Champions Cup Final was the final match in the 2018–19 European Rugby Champions Cup, and the twenty-fourth European club rugby final in general. The final was between defending champions and four-time winners Leinster, and two-time winners Saracens.\nSaracens defeated Leinster to claim their third title, overcoming a ten-point deficit to tie the score at half-time, before taking the lead in the second half to secure victory with a final result of 20–10.\nBackground.\nBoth Leinster and Saracens entered into the 2019 final with significant championship pedigree, having won six of the past ten top-tier European cup tournaments between them. Defending champions Leinster, who shared the accolade of most wins in tournament history (four) with Toulouse, had previously won the title in 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2018, and were looking for a record fifth trophy. Meanwhile, Saracens, who had gone undefeated in Europe this season, were aiming to win the cup for the third time in four seasons, following successes in 2016 and 2017, as well as become the first English rugby team ever to be crowned as European champions three times.\nLeinster and Saracens had met in European competition three times prior to this fixture. On all three of those occasions, Leinster were the victors, most recently in the quarter–finals of the 2017–18 tournament, when Leinster won 30–19 en route to winning the title.\nFrench referee Jérôme Garcès was officiating a Champions Cup final for the first time.\nRoute to the final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\"\nMatch.\nSummary.\nLeinster kicked off the match, and opened the scoring soon after, with a penalty kick from their fly-half and captain, Johnny Sexton, after three minutes. The game played out at a fierce intensity from then on, as both Leinster and Saracens enjoyed promising attacking spells in the first half-hour, which were repelled by solid defensive efforts from their opponents.\nFollowing a sustained period of pressure from Leinster, loosehead prop Cian Healy went over the try line, but was ruled by the television match official (TMO) to have been held up. However, Saracens lock Maro Itoje was sent to the sin bin for multiple offside infringements in the build-up, while the side also lost both starting props, Mako Vunipola and Titi Lamositele, at the same time due to injury. Leinster took advantage from a scrum in the next phase of play to score the game's first try, with tight-head prop Tadhg Furlong driving over from a ruck. With the subsequent conversion from Sexton, the Irish side led on the scoreboard by 10–0.\nFrom the restart, Saracens began to mount their comeback, and late in the half, a key tackle by lock George Kruis on Sexton forced a penalty, which fly-half Owen Farrell slotted to put his team on the board. A minute later, with the clock in the red, Saracens won another penalty, and kicked deep into Leinster's 22 for a line-out. After several phases among the forwards brought Saracens within inches of the try line, the ball was quickly distributed to the left wing for Sean Maitland to touch down. The try was successfully converted by Farrell, drawing the score level at 10–10 going into half-time.\nThe second half began in similar fashion to the opening 40 minutes, with both teams coming close to their second try, only for strong defence to hold them out. As the match approached the hour mark, Saracens played out a period of attacking play that mirrored Leinster in the first half. The English side's replacement prop Richard Barrington was ruled by the TMO to have been held up at the base of the left-hand post, but Leinster flanker Scott Fardy was given a yellow card because of repeat offences. Farrell kicked over the resulting penalty, giving Saracens the lead for the first time in the game.\nSaracens continued to apply pressure with a one-man advantage, and on 66 minutes, with a scrum five metres from the Leinster try line, Number 8 Billy Vunipola picked up the ball and managed to charge his way through four defenders to score under the posts. A straightforward conversion followed from Farrell, which gave his team a ten-point lead. There were no further scores for the remainder of the match, as Leinster sought to break out from their own half, but the Saracens defence stood firm. Upon the final whistle, Saracens were crowned the champions, with the final score of 20–10. \nIn the aftermath of the game, Saracens skipper and inside centre Brad Barritt, who recorded a game-high 28 tackles without missing one, was chosen as the Man of the Match. He also became only the second player in the history of the tournament to lift the title three times as a team captain, after former Leinster lock – and current head coach – Leo Cullen. In addition, full-back Alex Goode was named the European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) Player of the Year, making him the third Saracens player to receive the award, following on from Maro Itoje in 2016 and Owen Farrell in 2017. The victory also meant that Saracens had replicated their feat in the 2015–16 competition, achieving a 100 per cent win rate throughout."

        "title": "2018 Breeders' Cup",
        "text": "The 2018 Breeders' Cup World Championships was the 35th edition of the premier event of the North American thoroughbred horse racing year. The 14 races, all but one of which were Grade I, took place on November 2 and 3 at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. The races were telecast by NBCSN on Friday and early Saturday, and by NBC later on Saturday. The Breeders' Cup is generally regarded as the end of the North American racing season, although a few Grade I events take place in later November and December. The event typically determines champions in many of the Eclipse Award divisions, although it was missing the eventual Horse of the Year, Triple Crown champion Justify, who was retired in July.\nQualifying.\nA maximum of 14 horses (12 in the Turf Sprint and Juvenile Turf Sprint) are allowed to start in each race. Horses can automatically qualify by winning one of the designated races in the Breeders' Cup Challenge series, which provide \"Win and You're In\" berths in a specified division of the Breeders' Cup. Other pre-entries are ranked by a points system and the judgement of a panel of experts.\nA record 221 pre-entries were taken on October 24. Twelve races, including the Classic, were over-subscribed, meaning more than 14 horses (12 in the Juvenile Turf Sprint) wished to enter. Forty-eight of the pre-entries were automatic qualifiers through the Challenge series.\nFive winners of Challenge series races went on to win their respective division at the Breeders' Cup:\nEvent preparation.\nIn April 2016, the Breeders' Cup organization announced that Churchill Downs would host the event for the ninth time in 2018. As the home of the Kentucky Derby, Churchill Downs had the capacity to host the large crowds and betting handle expected at the event. Churchill Downs underwent a $70 million upgrade to its facilities to secure the bid, focused on improved dining and viewing spaces.\nOne of the major changes for 2018 was that the Friday card, dubbed \"Future Stars Friday\", featured five juvenile races (those restricted to two-year-old horses). This included a new race, the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf Sprint, which was the only race in the series that was not a Grade I event as it was not yet eligible for graded status. The Distaff, which had previously highlighted the Friday card, was held on Saturday.\nResults.\nFriday, November 2.\nThe attendance on Friday was 42,249, up 29% from the previous year at Del Mar and up 4% over the last time the Breeders' Cup was held at Churchill Downs, in 2011. The total amount wagered on the 10 race card was $52,216,685, similar to the amount wagered in 2017.\nGame Winner was the easy winner of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and established himself as the almost certain Champion two-year-old male horse and early favorite for the 2019 Kentucky Derby. The balloting for Champion two-year-old filly will likely be close between Newspaperofrecord, winner of the Juvenile Fillies Turf, and Jaywalk, winner of the Juvenile Fillies. Dirt runners normally are given an edge in North America, but Newspaperofrecord's win on the turf was considered one of the outstanding performances of the event.\nSource: Equibase Charts\nThe races were televised on NBCSN.\nSaturday, November 3.\nThe Saturday card was watched by a crowd of 70,423, a major increase from the previous year's attendance at Del Mar, which had been capped at 37,500. However, the total amount bet on the nine Breeders' Cup races held on Saturday was down 4% from 2017. The weather was cool with the turf course officially listed as good, verging on yielding. The main track was officially listed as fast.\nThe highlights were Accelerate's victory in the Classic and Enable's win in the Turf. Enable became the first horse to win the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and Breeders' Cup Turf in the same year. Her owner-breeder Juddmonte Farms, trainer John Gosden and jockey Frankie Dettori also won the Mile with Expert Eye.\nPeter Miller became the first person to train back-to-back winners of two races after Stormy Liberal and Roy H won the Turf Sprint and Sprint respectively. John Sadler, who saddled his first Breeders' Cup runner in 1988, earned his first win at the event with Accelerate in the Classic. Brad Cox also trained his first winner, Monomoy Girl in the Distaff.\nIrad Ortiz Jr. won the Shoemaker Award for outstanding jockey at the event after he won two races, the Juvenile Fillies Turf with Newspaperofrecord and the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint with Shamrock Rose, plus scoring five more top four finishes. Florent Geroux finished second in the standings after riding three winners over the weekend: Jaywalk in the Juvenile Fillies, Game Winner in the Juvenile and Accelerate in the Classic. Paco Lopez earned his first Breeders' Cup win aboard Roy H in the Sprint.\nWith his win in the Classic, Accelerate cemented his chances to win the Eclipse Award for Champion Older Male Dirt Horse, and moved into consideration for American Horse of the Year. Similarly, Monomoy Girl \"stands out\" in the three-year-old filly division after winning the Distaff and Roy H locked up his second win in the Sprint division. The female turf horse division will likely be between Enable, who became the first horse to win the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and Breeders' Cup Turf in the same year, and Sistercharlie, with four Group I wins in North America including the Filly &amp; Mare Turf.\nSource: Equibase Charts\nThe early races were televised by NBCSN. The main NBC network broadcast the Mile, Distaff, Turf and Classic."

At the bottom of the second ascent of the Ventoux, O'Connor began to struggle, eventually losing more than four minutes on the day. continued to splinter the GC group until Vingegaard attacked from the top. Pogačar followed his move before getting dropped by the Dane shortly afterwards. Vingegaard led by almost 40 seconds at the top while Pogačar, Carapaz, and Urán joined on the descent. The trio managed to work together to bring back Vingegaard near the \"flamme rouge\". In the GC, Pogačar's advantage over second place increased to more than five minutes as Urán moved up to second.\nThe twelfth and thirteenth stage featured chances for the sprinters. In stage 12, several teams attempted to split the race into echelons at the start of the stage, with the peloton splitting into three groups. A group of 13 soon went off the front while the peloton eased off and allowed the two other groups to rejoin the main peloton. No teams took up the chase as the break continued to extend their advantage. With to go, Nils Politt () started the attacks but he was chased down. A few kilometres later, Politt attacked again, this time with Küng, Harry Sweeny (), and Imanol Erviti (). Politt emerged as the strongest from the break, dropping his companions to solo to the stage win. The peloton finished around 16 minutes down. Stage 13 featured another threat of crosswinds in the final part of the course but the winds were not strong enough to form echelons. With to go, a crash on a descent took out several riders at the back of the peloton, with other riders also falling down a small ravine. No riders were seriously hurt but the crash led to several abandons. In a messy sprint to the line, Michael Mørkøv () led out Cavendish, who won his fourth stage of the race. His 34th career Tour win meant that he tied Eddy Merckx's record for the most number of Tour stage wins.\nThe fourteenth stage featured a transition stage as the race began to head into Andorra and the Pyrenees. It would take almost for a breakaway to be fully established. A 14-man break went off the front of the peloton, including Woods and Wout Poels () who were vying for the polka-dot jersey. The break also included Guillaume Martin (), who started the day in ninth place on the GC. On one of the descents, Woods slid out on a bend but he managed to rejoin the break. With to go and still on the descent, Mollema attacked off the front. He gained an advantage of more than a minute over his breakaway companions ahead of the final climb of the Col de Saint-Louis. He maintained his advantage to solo to the stage win. Woods took the polka-dot jersey from Quintana while Martin moved up to second overall. Mattia Cattaneo () also took enough time to move into the top ten. The other contenders remained together in preparation of the mountainous stage to Andorra.\nIn the fifteenth stage, the race headed to Andorra and passing over the Port d'Envalira, the highest point in the race. A large 32-rider group broke away from the peloton, eventually extending their advantage to around 10 minutes. The break included Woods, Poels, van Aert, and Quintana, who were all battling for the KOM competition. Woods and Poels were both neck and neck at the top before Poels soon took the lead to take the polka-dot jersey. Near the top of the Port d'Envalira, Quintana attacked to take the Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given to the first rider across the highest point in the Tour. Quintana would be caught on the descent. On the last climb of the day, the Col de Beixalis, Sepp Kuss () launched his move from the top. Only Alejandro Valverde () was able to follow his move before he began to struggle following Kuss. Kuss managed to hold off Valverde to win the stage. In the peloton, Martin and Cattaneo, two riders in the top ten of the GC, were distanced on the descent of the Envalira. On the climb of the Beixalis, several contenders attempted to attack but the other contenders were able to follow each time. The GC group finished around five minutes down on Kuss. Alexey Lutsenko (), who was seventh on GC, lost 29 seconds while Martin and Cattaneo conceded four and five minutes, respectively. Pogačar retained a lead of more than five minutes to keep the \"maillot jaune\" ahead of the second rest day.\nThird week: Pyrenees to finale in Paris.\nThe sixteenth stage of the race was another transition stage as the race headed into the Pyrenees. Much like stage 14, it took a while before a break formed before a trio of riders built a gap after the first climb. An 11-man chase group formed just before the intermediate sprint with the peloton letting them go. On the second climb of Col de la Core, Patrick Konrad () bridged up from the chase group to the trio up front before eventually attacking solo from the third climb of the day, the Col de Portet-d'Aspet. He soloed the rest of the day to win his team's second stage, 42 seconds ahead of Sonny Colbrelli (). The peloton enjoyed a quiet day but and van Aert instigated an attack on the Côte d'Aspret-Sarrat, causing a split in the peloton; however, all the contenders made it to the front group and all of them finished together.\nThe seventeenth stage featured the first of two consecutive summit finishes as the riders tackled two first-category climbs and the \"hors catégorie\" Col de Portet in the final . On Bastille Day, French riders composed four of the six riders in the break, gaining an advantage of more than eight minutes. Two riders, Anthony Perez () and Dorian Godon (), proved themselves as the strongest from the break as the duo led by four minutes heading into the final climb, the Col du Portet. Perez dropped Godon further up the climb, but chased him down. With to go, Pogačar attacked, catching Perez and bringing some of the contenders with him. He launched another acceleration a few moments later and this time, only Vingegaard and Carapaz could follow him. Pogačar and Vingegaard worked together while Carapaz sat in their wheels. Near the \"flamme rouge\", Carapaz launched his move, dropping Vingegaard while Pogačar immediately went to his wheel. Vingegaard slowly made his way back to set up a sprint for the win. With to go, Pogačar made his move, distancing his companions to win his second stage of the race. Vingegaard finished three seconds behind and one second ahead of Carapaz. The other contenders lost at least a minute and a half to the trio, who comprised the GC podium at the end of the day.\nThe next day was the final day in the mountains, with the riders tackling the Col du Tourmalet before a summit finish at Luz Ardiden. A break immediately formed at the start but they were not allowed to build a lead of more than two minutes. As the Tourmalet started, several riders bridged up to the break up front while the controlled the peloton and kept the break in check. From behind, Urán began to struggle, eventually losing nine minutes on the day. At the top of the Tourmalet, only two riders were left at the front as David Gaudu () and Pierre Latour () led by around half a minute ahead of a chase group composed of Poels and Woods. Gaudu pushed on the descent while the peloton swept up the remnants of the break. from the top of Luz Ardiden, Gaudu was caught. With left, Pogačar launched his attack, followed by Vingegaard, Carapaz, Mas, and Kuss. Inside the final kilometre, Mas attacked twice but he would be caught both times. After catching Mas a second time, Pogačar pushed on, eventually taking his second successive stage win. Vingegaard and Carapaz finished two seconds down while the other contenders lost between half a minute to a minute. Pogačar also took the polka-dot jersey after acquiring 80 points with his two consecutive stage wins.\nThe nineteenth stage featured a flat parcours. Two crashes took place at the start of the stage but no riders were seriously hurt. Only six riders comprised the break before being joined by 14 other riders with to go. The peloton chased hard but the break gradually increased their advantage before the peloton called off the chase. The attacks started with left before Mohorič went away with to go. The chase group were not able to work together as Mohorič slowly built his gap. Mohorič soloed to his second stage win while the peloton crossed the line 21 minutes down. The GC remained unchanged ahead of the final time trial.\nThe penultimate stage was a individual time trial. Stefan Bissegger () set the early benchmark time of 36' 37\" before Kasper Asgreen () beat Bissegger's time by 23 seconds. Küng threatened Asgreen's time at the first time check but he faded towards the end. Asgreen's time stood until van Aert beat his time by 21 seconds. His time would not be beaten as he won his second stage of the race. In the battle for the GC placings, all riders in the top ten kept their positions. Vingegaard finished with the third best time, 32 seconds behind van Aert, to confirm his second place on GC. Meanwhile, Pogačar avoided taking any risks, eventually finishing with the eighth best time as he put himself on the cusp of winning his second successive Tour title.\nThe final stage featured the traditional sprint stage to Champs-Élysées. The first part of the stage was ridden as a procession, with no riders attacking off the front. The race started in earnest as they passed through the finish line for the first time. Several breakaways were attempted but the stage would eventually come down to a sprint finish. In the final sprint to the line, Mike Teunissen () managed to lead out his teammate, van Aert, who managed to hold off Philipsen and Cavendish to win his second consecutive stage and his third overall in the race. All riders finished safely as 141 riders completed the race, 43 less than the number of riders who started in Brest. Pogačar won his second successive Tour title as well as winning the mountain and young riders classification for the second year running. Cavendish won his second points classification title while won the teams classification. Franck Bonnamour () won the overall combativity award after featuring in several breakaways."

This was the 72nd season in which an NCAA ice hockey championship was held, and United States college ice hockey's 125th year overall.\nRegular season.\nOvertime rule changes.\nThe NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel approved a proposal to allow conferences to use one of two alternative formats to award points in their league standings after the mandatory five-on-five, five-minute overtime period.\nAfter a traditional five-minute, five-on-five overtime, conferences may use either a five-minute, three-on-three overtime period and a shootout or only a shootout to award additional conference points. Conferences are not required to use one of the alternative systems and may end play after the five-minute overtime.\nDuring non-conference regular-season games, these alternative options are not permitted, and a game would end in a tie after the traditional five-minute overtime.\nIn regular-season tournaments that require advancement, a 20-minute sudden death format can be implemented for overtime, instead of the traditional five-minute overtime period. These tournaments also may use the three-on-three and shootout or the standalone shootout format.\nEach conference's approach if no goal is scored in the initial five-minute overtime:\nPoints Explanation:\nPairWise Rankings.\nThe PairWise Rankings (PWR) are a statistical tool designed to approximate the process by which the NCAA selection committee decides which teams get at-large bids to the 16-team NCAA tournament. Although the NCAA selection committee does not use the PWR as presented by USCHO, the PWR has been accurate in predicting which teams will make the tournament field.\nFor Division I men, all teams are included in comparisons starting in the 2013–14 season (formerly, only teams with a Ratings Percentage Index of .500 or above, or teams under consideration, were included). The PWR method compares each team with every other such team, with the winner of each “comparison” earning one PWR point. After all comparisons are made, the points are totaled up and rankings listed accordingly.\nWith 60 Division I men's teams, the greatest number of PWR points any team could earn is 59, winning the comparison with every other team. Meanwhile, a team that lost all of its comparisons would have no PWR points.\nTeams are then ranked by PWR point total, with ties broken by the teams’ RPI ratings, which starting in 2013–14 is weighted for home and road games and includes a quality wins bonus (QWB) for beating teams in the top 20 of the RPI (it also is weighted for home and road).\nWhen it comes to comparing teams, the PWR uses three criteria which are combined to make a comparison: RPI, record against common opponents and head-to-head competition. Starting in 2013–14, the comparison of record against teams under consideration was dropped because all teams are now under comparison.\nPlayer stats.\nScoring leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points; PIM = Penalty minutes\"\nLeading goaltenders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nCoaching changes.\nThis table lists programs that changed head coaches at any point from the first day of the 2018–19 season until the day before the first day of the 2019–2020 season.\n2019 NHL Entry Draft.\n&lt;br&gt;"

The tiers are shown below. Brackets show each team's seeding and their league (for example, \"1 Top 14\" indicates the team was seeded 1st from the Top 14).\nPool stage.\nThe following restrictions will apply to the draw:\nThe draw took place on 20 June 2018, in Lausanne, Switzerland.\nTeams in the same pool play each other twice, at home and away, in the group stage that begins on the weekend of 12/13/14 October 2018, and continues through to 18/19/20 January 2019.

        "title": "Marvin Williams (baseball)",
        "text": "Marvin Williams (February 12, 1920 – December 23, 2000) was an American baseball second baseman. Listed at 6' 0\" , 190 lb. , Williams batted and threw right handed. He was born in Houston, Texas.\nEven though he never made it to the majors, Williams accomplished a 19-year professional baseball career, beginning in 1943 in the Negro leagues, as his nomadic career took him to perform in Canada, Cuba, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Venezuela, before landing back in the United States to play on Minor League Baseball teams until his retirement in 1961. Among his most important achievements, Williams won two batting crowns, two home runs titles, and two Most Valuable Player awards. Moreover, Williams often ranked among the top 10 players in homers, doubles, runs batted in and runs scored throughout his career.\nEarly life.\nWilliams grew up in Houston and began playing semi-pro ball on sawmill towns of Texas such as Baytown and Conroe. In 1943, a group of players from local teams were selected to play on a barnstorming team that toured to various locations, usually small towns, to stage exhibition matches.. During the tour, Williams impressed a Negro league scout that offered him a contract to play in the league.\nCareer.\nTex, as he was dubbed by his teammates, debuted with the Philadelphia Stars club, playing for them from 1943 through 1945. In these three seasons, he recorded batting averages of .394, .365 and .325, respectively, while posting a slashing line of .363/.381/.538 overall in 248 games. In 1944, he was selected to play on the Negro leagues East squad at the East–West All-Star Game.\nFollowing his Negro league days, Williams was invited to Fenway Park for a Boston Red Sox tryout in 1945, on the recommendation of black sportswriter Wendell Smith. Invited with Williams were Sam Jethroe and Jackie Robinson, but none of them were offered a contract. It has been written that this was only a \"token tryout\", because at the time, the Red Sox had no plans to integrate their roster, according to press sources. Afterwards, Williams landed in the summer Mexican League and slashed .362/.410/.633 with the Diablos Rojos del México.\nIn between, Williams played winter ball with the Sabios de Vargas club of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League in 1946 and 1947. In 1946, Williams hit .329, led the league both in RBI (41) and runs (29), while setting a record with eight RBI in a single game after going 4-for-4 with two homers and two singles against Navegantes del Magallanes (March 7, 1946). This record would be matched by Leones del Caracas oufielder Jason Lane against the Águilas del Zulia 15 years later (December 6, 2001). He also played in Puerto Rico for the Leones de Ponce in two seasons between 1944 and 1949, and for the Pastora BBC in Venezuela in 1946.\nAt the end of 1947, Williams played briefly in the Cuban League with the Leones del Habana club, batting .286 (12-for-42) with four RBI in 10 games.\nWilliams returned to the Mexican League in 1948 and hit .328 with 14 home runs and 57 RBI for the Rojos, while also leading the league with 11 triples. Besides the Rojos, Williams played for the Charros de Jalisco and Tigres del México combined in all or parts of six seasons spanning 1945–1959. He then spent four winters in Mexico, playing from 1948 through 1951 with the Cañeros de Los Mochis of the Mexican Pacific League.\nIn his debut with Los Mochis, Williams gained notoriety when he belted the first home run ever hit in the legendary Emilio Ibarra Almada Stadium. Also in that season, he set a league record with 17 home runs in 60 games. That record was surpassed by Dick Hall two seasons later, when he hit 20 homers for the Venados de Mazatlán, although Hall did it in an 80-game season.\nWilliams came back to the United States in 1950, as he divided playing time at Triple A ball for the Sacramento Solons of the Pacific League as well as for the Cleveland Buckeyes during the Negro league's waning days. His most productive season came in 1952, when he hit .401 with 45 homers and 131 RBI for the Chihuahua Dorados of the Arizona–Texas League, leading the league in batting, home runs and slugging average (.854), and compiling more walks (117) than strikeouts (34) over 117 games. In addition, he was named the interim manager of the team during the midseason, becoming one of the first black managers in Minor League history, joining Sam Bankhead (1951 Farnham Pirates) and Chet Brewer (1952 Porterville Comets).\nWhile at Canada, Williams enjoyed another good season with the Vancouver Capilanos in 1954, leading the Western International League with a .360 average and 274 total bases, while ending second in home runs (20), hits (160) and doubles (34) and third in slugging (.601), He later split 1955 between the Columbia Gems of the South Atlantic League and the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League, hitting a combined .303 average with 21 home runs and 106 RBI in 132 games between the two stops. That winter, he returned to Mexico and played for the Mayos de Navojoa, hitting for them .347 with 11 home runs and 51 RBI, including a hitting for the cycle game, to earn MVP Award honors.\nAfterwards, Williams played from 1956 through 1958 for the Tulsa Oilers of the Texas League, where he averaged an overall of .291, 18 homers and 92 RBI in these three seasons. In 1956, he ranked among the best ten in the league with a .322 batting average (6th), 26 homers (7th), 111 RBI (4th), 102 runs (6th), 36 doubles (4th), 172 hits (10th), .565 SLG (6th), .394 OBP (10th) and .956 OPS (6th), en route to his second MVP Award. Notably, Williams competed with future big leaguers Don Demeter, Jim Gentile, Albie Pearson, Les Peden and Brooks Robinson.\nIn 1959, Williams came back to the Texas League with the Victoria Rosebuds where he was used strictly as a pinch hitter, going 2-for-5 in just five games. From there, he returned one last time to the Mexican League and divided his playing time between the Diablos Rojos and Tigres for the rest of year. In 109 games, Williams hit a combined .310/.424/.587 with 29 homers and a league-leading 109 RBI while tying for the most home runs.\nFor the last time in his native Texas, Williams played for the Rosebuds, Rio Grande Valley Giants and San Antonio Missions in a span of two seasons from 1960 to 1961. Overall, he posted a 279 average with 17 home runs in 1960, and hit 277 with 10 homers and 71 RBI in 1961 before ending his Organized Baseball career at age 41.\nPersonal life.\nAfter retirement, Williams worked at Sears Roebuck for 20 years, the first ten at Virginia and the rest after being transferred to Conroe. In his spare time he coached Little League Baseball teams. Williams was the father of two boys, Marvin Jr. and Billy, from his marriage with Gloria Pacheco, of Mexican origin. Williams passed largely unnoticed in Conroe, where he and his family lived quietly much of their life. He died in 2000 at the age of 80.\nExternal links.\n and Seamheads"

        "title": "Moree Baths and Swimming Pool",
        "text": "Moree Baths and Swimming Pool is a heritage-listed swimming pool at Anne Street, Moree, New South Wales, Australia. It was the site of one of the successful protests by Aboriginal Australians for their rights during the Freedom Ride in February 1965. The site was added to the Australian National Heritage List on 6 September 2013.\nHistory.\nBy-laws prohibited Aboriginal people from going to pubs or clubs or the swimming baths in Moree, and they were not allowed to walk on the sidewalk or play football in the local team. The local cinema was segregated - Blacks had to sit in the front rows. Lyall Munro Snr and the Moree Aboriginal Advancement Committee worked hard to change these segregationist policies.\nIn early 1965 a group of students from the University of Sydney led by Aboriginal student activist Charles Perkins embarked upon a bus trip known as the Freedom Ride through outback NSW and Queensland to highlight racial inequalities in Australia at the time. The trip was based on the \"Freedom Rides\" that occurred as part of the civil rights movement in the United States in the early 1960s. The bus travelled to number of towns where racial discrimination had been identified with the aim of highlighting the inequalities and raising the profile of this issue amongst the broader Australian community. A number of towns were visited including Walgett and Kempsey but in Moree, where a ban on Aboriginal use of the local pool was in force, the trip gained a national profile in the media and raised the profile of Charles Perkins as an iconic figure for the Indigenous community.\nThe events at the Moree Swimming Baths in February 1965 constitute a defining moment in the history of race relations in Australia. The activities of the Student Action for Aborigines group at Moree drew the attention of the public to the informal and institutional racial segregation practised at that time in outback towns in New South Wales. The events at Moree also highlighted the failures at both state and federal levels; while both spoke rhetoric of inclusion into the wider Australian society, Aboriginal people in country towns were still being excluded from sharing basic facilities. The publicity that the events at the Moree baths attracted contributed to shaping a climate of opinion resulting in a resounding Yes vote in the 1967 referendum, leading to a change in the Australian Constitution to allow the Australian Government to make laws specifically for Aboriginal people. The constitutional amendment provided the legal basis for subsequent Australian Government involvement in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, and also led to increased recognition of the importance of Indigenous rights in Australia.\nThe Freedom Ride and the events at Moree have their origins in a heightened concern about racial discrimination in Australia after the Second World War. In 1945 the international community, in its attempts to provide peace and security in a world traumatised by the social and economic disruption of total war, agreed to recognise the political aspirations of, and to promote self-government in, colonised countries.\nIn 1960 the British Prime Minister, Harold MacMillan responded to the Sharpeville massacre in Cape Town by delivering his \"Winds of Change\" speech to the South African Parliament. The speech recognised the inevitable growth of African national consciousness. The Australian Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, and MacMillan tried to develop a form of words that would keep the Commonwealth intact. However, the final statement released at the end of the 1961 meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers expressed concern at the effect that South Africa's racial policies could have on relations between Commonwealth countries that were members of a multi-racial association of people.\nMenzies declined to become involved in overt criticism of apartheid, arguing that it was an internal matter for South Africa in which Australia should not interfere. Despite the government's silence, an anti-apartheid movement began to form which included the National Union of Australian University Students.\nSouth Africa was not the only country where there were laws institutionalising segregation and racial discrimination. In the early 1960s, protests by the civil rights movement against racial segregation laws in the United States of America led to brutal response by police in southern states. The police response and subsequent mass jailing received widespread coverage in Australia. In response to the mass protests and arrests in Birmingham, Alabama, the American President, John Kennedy, introduced a Civil Rights Bill to Congress in 1963. His successor, Lyndon Johnson, sought to push the bill through Congress in the early months of 1964. Sydney University students decided to protest outside the United States consulate on 6 May 1964 in support of the Bill, and against the senators from southern states who were attempting through filibuster to prevent its passage. When police began arresting protestors, fellow students tried to free them. The initial scuffle turned into what one newspaper described as \"an all-in brawl\", leading to extensive media publicity.\nInternational and some local reports of the demonstration included suggestions that demonstrators were hypocritical because they focused on fashionable American civil rights issues but did not consider the treatment of Australia's Indigenous minority, which was also racially discriminatory. In 1965, assimilation rather than segregation had been Australian Government policy for at least a decade, but the Australian Government powers were limited to persuasion since Aboriginal policy was firmly a matter for the state governments at this time. In his statement after the 1961 Native Welfare Conference, the Hon Paul Hasluck, the Australian Government Minister for Territories, described this policy as one that would enable Aboriginal people to:\n\"... live as members of a single Australian community, enjoying the same responsibilities, observing the same customs and influenced by the same beliefs, hopes and loyalties as other Australians.\"\nDiscriminatory legislation was removed by the Australian Government and state governments in the early 1960s. The last two states to grant Aboriginal people voting rights were Western Australia in 1962, and Queensland in 1962 (for Australian elections) and 1965 (for state elections). In New South Wales, Aboriginal policy was managed by the Aborigines Welfare Board (AWB), which sought either to keep people on its managed stations or to exert control over the rest through a network of district welfare officers. Typically, Aboriginal people lived on the fringes of towns, either in unhealthy shanty settlements or in highly regulated stations. They continued to suffer the effects of racial discrimination at a local level, socially, economically, and culturally.\nThere was, however, a growing movement for Aboriginal rights in the late 1950s and early 1960s, represented most clearly by the organisations brought together by the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines (in 1964 Torres Strait Islanders were added so that the acronym became FCAATSI). Students had not been a significant part of this movement, but after the criticisms of their actions outside the US Embassy in May 1964, and influenced by the arrival the year before of Charles Perkins and Gary Williams as the first two Aboriginal students at the University of Sydney, they began to organise a very successful student-organised demonstration and concert. This took place on National Aborigines Day in Hyde Park in Sydney and was followed by the formation in July 1964 of a more permanent organisation, Student Action for Aborigines (SAFA). This organisation drew people from many of the political, religious and recreational clubs in the University and it had an Aboriginal student, Charles Perkins, as Chairman.\nThe proposed Freedom Ride with its focus on racial discrimination and segregation resonated with Charles Perkins' life. He was born at The Bungalow in Alice Springs. His Eastern Arrernte mother, recognising there were limited educational opportunities in Alice Springs, took up an offer for him to go to St Francis House, an Anglican home for boys of mixed Aboriginal and other descent in Semaphore South, Adelaide. He had encountered discrimination against Aboriginal people in Alice Springs and this continued when he moved to Adelaide.\nOne of the suggested activities for the SAFA group, which was inspired by the Freedom Rides in America, was a bus tour of Aboriginal settlements. Unlike the American Freedom Rides, which aimed to challenge segregation on interstate buses and at interstate bus terminals in the south, SAFA planned their bus tour to highlight the plight of Aboriginal people in rural Australia on a range of issues. Their aim was to undertake a social survey into the extent of racial discrimination in country towns, and then to draw discrimination to the attention of the wider Australian public through the press, radio and television. They wanted to point out the discriminatory barriers and inadequacies in health and housing as well as supporting Aboriginal people in challenging the status quo. The group decided to adopt Martin Luther King's approach of non-violent resistance when dealing with opponents.\nPreparations for the trip included a number of fundraisers including folk concerts, dances and sales of Christmas cards. SAFA also received donations from the Student Union, and each student participant contributed ten pounds. They heard talks and produced a reading list about the barriers facing Aboriginal people in outback New South Wales to help them prepare themselves for the trip. The group also had several people as sources of information on discrimination and segregation in the towns in northern New South Wales. One was Jack Horner of the Aboriginal Australian Fellowship. He provided information on issues in a number of towns in outback New South Wales including Walgett, Moree and Kempsey. He also advised the SAFA about recent reports and conferences dealing with Aboriginal health and education. Charles Perkins, the President of the group was another source of information for the bus trip. During the summer, he worked for the Foundation for Aboriginal Affairs, where his interaction with job seekers, evicted families and those requiring access to social services enabled him to gain an understanding of the issues faced by Aboriginal people in New South Wales. He gained further insight into racial prejudice and segregation in some of the towns when he was invited to join a light plane tour through New South Wales with a journalist, Craig Williams, and the Reverend Ted Noffs, who had agreed to help the students design their survey.\nWith all the preparations completed, the Freedom Ride bus left Sydney on 13 February 1965. Its first stop was Wellington where the students conducted surveys and investigations, highlighting social injustices and uncovering evidence of racial discrimination. However, without local Aboriginal contacts and with insufficient firm information to justify a demonstration they moved onto to the next town, Gulargambone. While the conditions under which Aboriginal people lived there were quite shocking, there was not a clear case of racial discrimination on which to demonstrate. The next stop was Walgett, and here the Freedom-riders took action. Walgett had both an existing group of Aboriginal activists and some clear cases of racial discrimination. It proved to be the first real showdown for the Freedom Riders. They spent their first day conducting interviews to obtain information about segregation and racial discrimination and found that the cinema, the Returned Servicemen's League (RSL) club, the town's two hotels and a frock shop were all segregated. The Freedom Riders picketed the Walgett RSL club from noon until sunset holding placards stating \"Walgett: Australian's disgrace\", \"Bar the Colour Bar\", \"Good enough for Tobruk - why not Walgett RSL?\".\nWalgett was the first big test for the students. While their protest did little to change the attitudes of the townsfolk, they encouraged the Aboriginal community to push for change. Aboriginal people who participated in pickets were bitter at the ongoing discrimination they experienced in their town and they continued to protest and agitate for desegregation in the establishments that still upheld a colour ban after the protestors left. Initially, there was little media interest in the events in Walgett. However, a report by Bruce Maxwell, a cadet reporter for \"The Herald\", brought the SAFA Freedom Ride into the national spotlight. The Sydney Morning Herald and The Daily Mirror newspapers as well as TV and radio now began to report on the next stage of the Freedom Ride in Moree.\nThe pattern of racial discrimination and segregation in Moree was similar to that found in Walgett with some firms refusing to employ Aboriginal people, and most hotels refusing to serve them. The students' attention, however, focused on the swimming pool, where a council by-law prevented Aboriginal people's entry. This was an example of discrimination enforceable under local ordinance so it was seen to be similar to officially sanctioned apartheid in South Africa and segregation in the United States. In addition, a local councillor, alderman Bob Brown, had repeatedly tried to get the council to allow Aborigines to use the baths, but to no avail - he could not even get a seconder for his motion.\nInitially, the Freedom Riders held a picket at the Moree council chambers to protest against the exclusion of Aboriginal people (except for school children during school hours) from the Moree baths. The next day Bob Brown and the Freedom Riders tried to take Aboriginal children into the pool. The pool manager argued heatedly with the student leaders. The impasse ended when the mayor agreed to allow the children in. That evening, the students held a public meeting to explain why they were in Moree and to present their survey results. Initially the largely white audience reacted angrily and some left, but after discussion the atmosphere changed. The meeting concluded by passing a motion that the by-law segregating the pool should be removed, which the mayor said he would take to the council.\nThe Freedom Riders left Moree the next day, jubilant that the colour ban had been lifted. While the students travelled to Boggabilla and then to Warwick in southern Queensland, Bob Brown tried to take another group of Aboriginal children to the pool but the pool manager refused them entry and decided to close the pool. Following an emergency council meeting, the mayor arrived and ordered the manager to re-open the pool and enforce the by-law providing for segregation of the baths. The following day Bob Brown called the Freedom Riders to let them know what had happened. Charles Perkins had flown to Sydney to be interviewed for a television programme. The students phoned the Methodist Minister in Moree who confirmed Bob Brown's story and told them that they would not be welcome in Moree. The students decided to turn the bus around and return to Moree.\nThe Freedom Riders stopped at Inverell that night and picked up Charles Perkins in the morning. Charles felt that the opportunity to achieve a \"break through\" was at stake and saw Moree as the place to do this. On returning to Moree, the Freedom Riders again collected a number of Aboriginal children from the mission to gain admittance into the swimming pool. They attempted to enter the pool with the children for three hours. By this time, a large crowd of locals had gathered outside the pool. It was hostile and tempers were inflamed. Some locals threw eggs and tomatoes. They knocked some students down and at least one was punched. Fights broke out and police arrested several crowd members. The media reported the attacks on the students as \"little different from the American South\".\nA breakthrough came when the mayor of Moree, Bill Lloyd, came down to the baths and informed the students and the crowd that he was prepared to sign a motion to rescind the 1955 by-law. After some negotiation, the Freedom Riders accepted these assurances and agreed to leave. They boarded the bus under a hail of eggs and tomatoes and the police provided a protective escort as the bus left town.\nThe Freedom Riders continued their journey, visiting the coastal towns in northern New South Wales to undertake their surveys and highlight instances of racial discrimination. While the students demonstrated against particular instances of discrimination and segregation in towns like Kempsey and Bowraville, the local reactions were more muted than those in Moree.\nThe reports and photos in the major newspapers of the events at Moree shocked many white Australians, making them aware of the plight of Aboriginal people. By drawing attention to both informal and officially sanctioned segregation and racial discrimination, the Freedom Ride helped to show that governmental rhetoric, that Aboriginal people should share in the benefits and opportunities of Australians generally, was not being applied in practice.\nThe Freedom Riders highlighted the fact that, contrary to government policy, segregation and discrimination were endemic in many of the rural towns of New South Wales. The council ordinance prohibiting Aboriginal people from using the Moree baths demonstrated that discrimination was officially sanctioned in some cases. Whether the Australian Government was unable or unwilling to tackle such contradictory policies is unclear. Section 51 of the constitution, prohibited the Government from passing laws specifically for Aboriginal Australians. There was also a lack of will to use the external affairs powers to address racial discrimination.\nBy highlighting endemic racism in Australia, the Freedom Ride contributed to the passage of the 1967 referendum, which altered the constitution to allow the Commonwealth to make laws for Aboriginal people. It also contributed to the passage in 1975 of legislation prohibiting racial discrimination and encouraged some Aboriginal people to become active in challenging the status quo of segregation and discrimination. The Freedom Ride has been described as one of those transitional moments in Australian history when one era fades and another takes its place.\nDescription.\nMoree Baths and Swimming Pool is at about 0.5ha, Lot 20 bounded by Anne Street, Gosport Street and Warialda Street in Moree.\nThe Moree Hot Artesian Pool Complex (Moree baths) is owned and managed by the Moree Plains Shire Council. The original hot pool opened in 1895 when the first bore that tapped into the Great Artesian Basin was completed. The bore delivered mineral waters, heated naturally to about 41 degrees Celsius. A small basin was originally excavated and gravelled. This was later upgraded with a small wooden lined basin for bathing. The original bore ceased to flow in 1957, and the hot mineral waters are now pumped to the baths. Currently the large municipal complex comprises three tiled pools.\nCondition.\nThe building is still in use and is in good condition. Since 1965 the exterior has been modified and there have been minor refurbishments to the interior of the baths and swimming pool. These modifications have not affected its heritage value relating to the 1965 Freedom Ride.\nHeritage listing.\nIn 1965 student protest actions at the Moree baths highlighted the racial discrimination and segregation experienced by Aboriginal people in Australian rural towns and the outback and forced the broader Australia community to look at the way it treated its Indigenous population. The protest was an important contributor to the climate of opinion which resulted in a yes vote in the 1967 referendum to change the Australian Constitution regarding the status of Aboriginal Australians. That change provided a legal basis for subsequent Australian Government involvement in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs and an increased recognition at local, state, and national levels of the importance of Indigenous rights in Australia.\nThe events that occurred at the Moree baths in 1965 also have a special association with the life and works of the Aboriginal activist Dr Charles Nelson Perrurle Perkins AO. Moree was the place where the public first saw him confront people with awkward truths about the treatment of Aborigines. This combined with other events that occurred in the wider Freedom ride, brought Charles Perkins to public prominence as a leading Aboriginal activist and established him as an iconic figure for both young and older Aborigines alike. In addition it clearly demonstrated his commitment to achieving equity for Aboriginal people in Australia, which became a lifelong cause.\nMoree Baths and Swimming Pool was listed on the Australian National Heritage List on 6 September 2013 having satisfied the following criteria.\nCriterion A: Events, Processes\nThe Moree baths has outstanding national heritage value under criterion (a) as the place where student protests in 1965 highlighted the legalised segregation and racism experienced by Aboriginal people in outback Australia. It brought the racial discrimination and segregation experienced by the Aboriginal population in Australian country and rural towns to the attention and consciousness of the white Australian population. It forced Australia to look at the way it treated its Indigenous population and showed that racial segregation continued in many towns. The protest was an important contributor to the climate of opinion which produced a yes vote in the 1967 referendum to change the Australian Constitution. From that change came a legal basis for subsequent Commonwealth involvement in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs and an increased recognition at local, state, and national levels of the importance of Indigenous rights in Australia.\nCriterion H: Significant people\nThe Moree baths has outstanding heritage value to the nation under criterion (h) as the place that has a special association with the life and works of the Aboriginal activist Dr Charles Nelson Perrurle Perkins AO. The events at the Moree baths in 1965 brought him into public prominence as a leading Aboriginal activist and it was here that his tactic of confronting people with awkward truths about their treatment of Aboriginal people first emerged in a public context. This pattern was repeated throughout his life even when it resulted in costs to him personally. The events that occurred in Moree, and the wider Freedom ride, established Charles Perkins as an iconic figure for both young and older Aboriginal people alike. In addition it clearly demonstrated his commitment to achieving equity for Aboriginal people in Australia, something that became a lifelong cause."

        "title": "One-armed versus one-legged cricket",
        "text": "One-armed versus one-legged is a form of cricket in which one team has cricketers with only one arm while the members of the other team only have one leg.\nThere have been several matches of this sort, held for the annual benefit of the Greenwich pensioners – sailors pensioned off from the Royal Navy and resident at the Royal Hospital for Seamen at Greenwich. These sailors often lost limbs during naval service in the 18th century and so the teams were drawn from the ranks of the pensioners. In 1861, Charles Dickens reported a civilian match at Peckham Rye in his magazine, \"All the Year Round\".\nMatches.\n1766.\nIn 1766, two teams of Greenwich pensioners played a match at Blackheath. The one-armed team beat the one-legged team quite handily.\n1796.\nTwo teams of Greenwich pensioners played at Aram's New Ground in Walworth for a prize of a thousand guineas. The match was advertised and so there was a large crowd of spectators. The teams arrived in three stagecoaches at 9 in the morning and play started at 10. The one-legged team batted first, scoring 93 runs in that innings. The one-armed team scored 42 runs in their first innings but there had been a great commotion while they were batting as a press of would-be spectators broke down a gate and some fencing to get in. Some climbed on top of a stable which collapsed so they were bruised. The one-legged team batted again and scored sixty more runs for the loss of six wickets. The game finished that evening with the one-legged team winning by 153 runs to 42.\nThere was a rematch on the following Wednesday. A one-legged batter lost his wooden leg while making a run. The leg was fielded and thrown to stump him. This was a fine point of rules as the batter's equipment had not disturbed the wicket while making the stroke but he was still given out. Notwithstanding this loss, the one-legged team won again by 103 runs.\nThe spectacle then concluded with a 100-yard dash in which the one-legged team raced for a prize pool of 20 guineas.\n1841.\nTwo teams of Greenwich pensioners played at Hall's ground in Camberwell.\n1848.\nTwo teams of Greenwich pensioners played at a ground formerly part of Lewisham Priory. The match was organised by Messrs Ingersoll and Stanton who managed to attract two thousand, four hundred spectators who were attracted by the novelty of the event. The game was played over two days and the teams were well-provisioned throughout, being given a hearty lunch before play and dinners of roast beef and lamb with plenty of strong ale at the Bull Inn. A band provided music for the occasion and the cricket players were additionally rewarded with a glass of grog and a fee of ten shillings. The one-legged men had difficulty connecting with the wide bowling, often being got out as they span around like a top. The one-armed team was the betting favourite and won the match, scoring 50 runs in their first innings and 41 in the second. The score of the one-legged team was 32 and 44, making the result 91 to 76 in favour of the one-armed team.\n1861.\nCharles Dickens reported a match in his magazine, \"All the Year Round\", having seen an advertisement in the window of a tobacconist. It was held at Peckham Rye in the grounds of the Rosemary Branch tavern, which hosted many sporting events and pastimes. The match was for the benefit of one of the one-armed men and the players were mostly locals but one was a well-known musical barber and dancer from Essex, who bowled for the one-legged team. Some spectators sat on benches but Dickens sat on the roller which was used to level the pitch. He described the spectacle as \"painfully wonderful and ludicrously horrible\":After much energetic play and incident, the one-armed team won by 14 runs.\n1863.\nThere was a match in Manchester where a player nicknamed \"No-Legs\" bowled for one team."

        "title": "Xtreme triathlon",
        "text": "Extreme (or Xtreme) Triathlon refers to a type of triathlon competition where competitors race over distances broadly equivalent to those of an Ironman triathlon (3.8k swim, 180k bike, 42k run) or an Ironman 70.3 (1.9k swim, 90k bike, 21k run) under extreme courses, with night/cold swim, large elevation changes and high altitude during both the cycling and running sections. Athletes also deal with extreme weather conditions due to the remote locations and large elevation changes.\nThe number of participants is limited (usually to 250 to 300) and some races operate a ballot entry system. These small numbers allow races to be held in remote and inaccessible locations which is one of many characteristic of extreme triathlon.\nSome races are \"unsupported\" so competitors need to have personal back up crews that support to provide them with food, drinks and other necessities. The support crews also often need to accompany their competitor on any potentially dangerous mountain sections. During these sections, competitors are often required to carry a backpack containing emergency food and clothing should the weather change.\nHistory.\nThe original Extreme Triathlon was the Norseman Xtreme Triathlon first held in 2003. Many other races have followed on from this and in 2012 the concept of \"AllXTRI was launched\" as a global brand that encompassed Norseman along with Celtman and Swissman. This evolved into what is known as the XTRI World Tour® although many other well renowned races and series of similar format exist around the world. Extreme Triathlon Series is a series of races that has gained popularity over the years, due to it`s low key and friendly atmosphere.\nThe independent races are growing rapidly and currently a vast number of races choose to stay outside of «mainstream» Xtreme Triathlon. Alps Man, PatagonMan and Olympos X are independent races that has gained popularity and a massive following. \nCourse formats.\nExtreme triathlon should not be confused with Ultra-triathlon. Hence, length is not the defining factor for extreme triathlon.\nExtreme triathlons typically include four key elements:\nIt’s important to note that while one or more of these elements may be present in an extreme triathlon, there are also races that don’t incorporate any of them, yet are still considered extreme due to other challenging factors.\nExtreme triathlon communities &amp; activities.\nMany extreme triathlon races created Facebook groups or similar to allow their athletes to plan and discuss races. Some of these are relatively open format, and some set up with a closed audience related to specific athletes in specific years.\nIn late 2019, a 'Global Extreme Triathlon Forum' Facebook group and 'Global Extreme Triathlon Club' on Strava were also set up to create a community across all extreme triathlon races worldwide, and also help nurture aspiring athletes. This has been growing ever since.\nIn 2023 a website called Global Extreme Triathlon was set up with the intent to gather information on all Extreme Triathlons in one place. This has been a success, especially for the independent races that are not a part of «mainstream» Xtreme Triathlon.\nCOVID in 2020 impacted races globally. All early extreme triathlon races were cancelled or postponed, but some later races managed to convene due to their format of being small in more remote locations. In this backdrop, several races created virtual challenges where athletes completed 'events' wherever they could, or on Zwift (or similar) if unable to get outside.\nXTRI® World Championship.\nThe XTRI® World Championship is an annual event that takes place at Norseman every August. \nThe first championship took place in 2019 with less than 50 athletes starting in a small field before the main race. The entire field of Norseman is now the World Championship.\nThe international governing body World Triathlon does not recognize any XTRI® World Tour Championships as official Xtreme Triathlon World Championships. However, they are independent races similar to that of the Ironman World Championship or XTERRA Triathlon World Championship.\nThe current XTRI® World Championship Rankings for 2023 are as follows:\nWomen:\nMen:\nDue to the popularity of the half distance extreme triathlon, XTRI® World Championship solo point five will also be taking place every year as of 2025. However, contrary to the full distance XTRI® World Championship which takes place in the same location every year, the half distance XTRI® World Championship will take place in different location each year.\nTrademarks.\nThe terms \"XTRI\" and derivatives are owned by XTRI World Tour AS, Norway. These terms are considered generic descriptions of Extreme, or Xtreme triathlon by many, but are in fact registered and protected trademarks."

Although there are no stipulations on player selection, the cup was seen by many clubs as a development competition, and games took place during the Autumn International window and during the Six Nations.\nNorthampton Saints became the first ever winners of the Premiership Cup when they defeated Saracens 23 – 9 in the final at Franklin's Gardens on 17 March 2019. It was the Saints' first domestic cup triumph since winning the 2009–10 LV Cup and their second overall.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition consists of the twelve English Premiership teams arranged in three pools of four clubs each, with each team playing three games against teams in their pool, as well as a 'derby' game against a team in another group. The top team in each pool, plus the best overall runner up, progress to the semi-finals, with the highest ranked teams having home advantage. The winners of the semi-finals then meet at the final in March 2019 to be held at the home ground of the highest ranked remaining team.\nPool stage.\nRound 4 (derby games).\nAfter three pool games, each team will play a 'derby' game against a team in another pool, with results counting towards the final standings in each pool.\nKnock-out stage.\nThe four qualifiers are seeded according to performance in the pool stage.

        "text": "The 2021 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament was a single-elimination tournament of 64 teams to determine the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college basketball national champion for the 2020–21 NCAA Division I women's basketball season. The 39th edition of the tournament began on March 21, 2021, in sites around San Antonio, Texas, and concluded with the championship game on April 4 at the Alamodome, with the Stanford Cardinal defeating the Arizona Wildcats 54–53 to win their third NCAA title.\nDue to logistical considerations surrounding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (which resulted in the cancellation of the 2020 tournament), and mirroring a similar decision by the men's tournament, the entire tournament was played in the San Antonio area rather than at sites across the country, with some first and second round games played in nearby San Marcos and Austin. The Alamodome hosted all games from the regional semifinals onward, including the originally-awarded Final Four and championship game.\nFour schools, America East champion Stony Brook, Big South champion High Point, Missouri Valley champion Bradley and Utah Valley from the WAC (California Baptist won the WAC tournament, but was ineligible for the NCAA tournament because it is in the third year of a four-year transition from Division II), made their first appearance in the tournament.\nAdditionally, Tennessee continued its record streak of making every edition of the tournament. Arizona made its first-ever appearance in the Final Four. UConn extended its record streak of 13 consecutive Final Four appearances. Wake Forest and Washington State made their first appearances since 1988 and 1991, respectively.\nTournament procedure.\nThe tournament's 64 teams consisted of the 31 conference champions (down from 32, due to the Ivy League having cancelled all winter athletics due to COVID-19), and 33 \"at-large\" bids extended by the Selection Committee.\nThis tournament was the first since 1983 in which the RPI was not used in the selection process. On May 4, 2020, the NCAA announced that it would replace the RPI with the NET (NCAA Evaluation Tool), a metric that has been used in the selection process for the men's tournament since 2019. The women's version of the NET uses input data specific to the women's game but is otherwise functionally identical to the men's version.\nSchedule and venues.\nOn February 5, 2021, the NCAA announced that due to logistical considerations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (which prompted the cancellation of the 2020 tournament), the entirety of the tournament would be conducted at sites in and around San Antonio and Austin (mirroring a similar decision for the men's tournament, which would similarly use venues in and around its Final Four host city of Indianapolis), rather than across the country;\nFirst and second round (March 21–22, 23–24)\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight) (March 27–30)\nNational semifinals and championship (final Four and championship) (April 2 and 4)\nThe Alamodome had two courts for first- and second-round games, and was converted to a single court for later rounds. Practices were held at the Alamodome and the Henry B. González Convention Center. The regions were named after famous sites in San Antonio: the Alamo, the HemisFair, the Mercado, and the River Walk.\nAll games were played behind closed doors (with only friends and family present) until the Sweet Sixteen at the Alamodome, which operated at 17% capacity (10,880) for the remainder of the tournament.\nFacilities inequality.\nConcerns over gender inequality were raised prior to the tournament, citing differences in the quality of facilities and amenities between the women's and men's tournament; among other examples, Arizona coach Adia Barnes criticized the lack of weight training equipment in the workout room (consisting of only a single tower of weights, in comparison to the larger weight room of the men's tournament). A video by Oregon forward Sedona Prince showing the aforementioned weight room drew wider attention to the disparity on social media. Other forms of disparities were noted, including differing COVID-19 testing protocols, smaller \"swag bags\", and different food options.\nThe NCAA had originally planned for the full weight room to only become available for the Sweet Sixteen round. Vice President of Women's Basketball Lynn Holzman stated that the NCAA had planned to expand the facilities in the workout room over the course of the tournament due to space constraints, but were \"actively working to enhance existing resources at practice courts, including additional weight training equipment.\" Barnes stated that the Henry B. González Convention Center had \"plenty of open areas\" that could have been used, and that \"it takes people like me that were pro players being a voice for things to change. There's a lot of voices out there. People care now. The fact that the NCAA responded so fast, I think that's good. That's meaningful.\"\nIn a letter obtained by tournament broadcaster ESPN on March 22, NCAA president Mark Emmert stated that \"much has been resolved\", but that he would investigate \"exactly how we found ourselves in this situation\", and \"directed our leadership team and appropriate staff to assess all the services, resources, and facilities provided to both the men's and women's teams so that we have a completely clear comparison\". The America East Conference and Ivy League sent a letter to Emmert, arguing that the incident \"warrants a comprehensive discussion once the tournaments conclude about how we—national office staff and membership—can protect and ensure equity across all championships in the future, but especially in the sport of basketball.\"\nThe incident led to discussions surrounding other forms of inequalities between the men's and women's tournaments, including their difference in budget, no revenue bonuses awarded to schools for winning the tournament, NCAA marketing of \"March Madness\" having focused almost exclusively on the men's tournament (with the women's tournament having never officially used the name; and tournament branding often used generic \"NCAA Women's Basketball\" logos instead), and the men's tournament often being referred to as \"the NCAA tournament\" by media and the general public with no disambiguation. In a \"Sportico\" op-ed, America East commissioner Amy Huchthausen accused the NCAA of \"restricting women’s basketball from taking advantage of an emerging market\", noting that the NCAA's official sponsorships are managed by the CBS Sports/Turner Sports consortium that broadcasts the men's tournament, and that the ESPN contract to televise the women's tournament (which is bundled with those of other NCAA championships) \"provides a measure of financial certainty, but it does not provide women's basketball (or any of the other sports, for that matter) an incentive to grow\".\nThe NCAA commissioned an independent review of gender equality among all of its championships by the law firm Kaplan Hecker &amp; Fink LLP; the first phase, focusing specifically on NCAA basketball championships, was published on August 3, 2021. The review concluded that the structure of the NCAA's operations were designed to \"maximize the value of and support to the Division I Men's Basketball Championship as the primary source of funding for the NCAA and its membership\"; it found that the CBS/Turner sponsorship contracts require advertisers to pay for marketing rights across all of the NCAA's championships (including the men's tournament, which can be costly), and that advertisers also had to separately pay ESPN for airtime during the women's tournament's telecasts. The review included several recommendations, including that:\nThe NCAA implemented two of these recommendations—the expansion to a 68-team format, and use of the \"March Madness\" branding—for the 2022 tournament. The NCAA renewed its contract with ESPN in January 2024 under an eight-year contract, now valued at an average of $115 million per-season, and granting ESPN additional rights to sell sponsorships for its tournament broadcasts.\nOriginal 2021 NCAA tournament schedule and venues.\nThe tournament's first two rounds were originally scheduled to be hosted by the top sixteen seeds. The following were the sites initially selected to host the later rounds of the 2021 tournament:\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight) (March 26–29)\nNational semifinals and championship (final Four and championship) (April 2 and 4)\nThis is the third time that the women's Final Four was played in San Antonio, having previously been played in the city in 2002 and 2010.\nQualification and selection.\nAutomatic qualifiers.\nThe following teams automatically qualified for the 2021 NCAA field by virtue of winning their conference's tournament.\nBracket.\nAll times are listed as Central Daylight Time ()&lt;br&gt;\nFinal Four.\nDuring the Final Four round, Stanford, the winner of the Alamo Regional defeated South Carolina, the winner of the HemisFair Regional. Arizona, the winner of the Mercado Regional defeated UConn, the winner of the River Walk Regional. In the championship game, Stanford defeated Arizona by a score of 54–53 to take the 2021 title.\nMedia coverage.\nTelevision.\nESPN served as broadcaster of the tournament, as part of its multi-year deal to broadcast NCAA national championships. Following a similar broadcast arrangement to the men's tournament under the CBS/Turner consortium, ESPN announced that all games in the tournament would be televised nationally in their entirety by either ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, or, for the first time, ABC (marking the first women's tournament to include coverage on broadcast television since 1995), rather than use a mix of regional broadcasts, streaming, and \"whiparound\" feeds.\nKerry Callahan became the first woman to serve as producer for ESPN's coverage of the Women's Final Four.\nBroadcast assignments.\n\"First and Second rounds\"\n\"Regionals\"\n\"Final Four\"\nRadio.\nWestwood One has exclusive radio rights to the entire tournament. Teams participating in the Elite Eight, Final Four, and Championship were allowed to have their own local broadcasts, but they were not allowed to stream those broadcasts online.\n\"Regional finals\"\n\"Final Four and Championship\""

        "title": "Baseball in Germany",
        "text": "Baseball in Germany started in 1936, with the first official baseball game being played at the 1936 Olympics. After World War II, baseball was popularized by American soldiers who were stationed in Germany. Today, baseball is a minor sport in Germany, although the country is still home to one of Europe's biggest baseball communities, with around 30,000 active players. The national governing body is the Deutscher Baseball und Softball Verband (German Baseball and Softball Federation), and the highest baseball league is the 1. Baseball Bundesliga. Max Kepler is currently the only German-developed player in Major League Baseball.\nHistory.\nBefore World War II.\nThe first mention of baseball in Germany was found in a 1796 book on sports by German writer Johann Christoph Friedrich GutsMuths, where he was writing about a game called \"schlagbal\", a very old German-Austrian game. Although Germans were exposed to bat-and-ball games from an early stage, baseball did not rise in popularity until after World War II. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, a lot of European countries received interest from major league players, one of which was Hall of Fame member John McGraw. From 1888 to 1889, A.G. Spalding went on a Major League Baseball world tour where he visited Italy, France and the United Kingdom, but not Germany since Berlin was covered in snow that winter. In 1912-1913, John McGraw and Charlie Comiskey went on another world tour, but again Germany, because of the threat of inclement weather during the tour, was left off the schedule. This likely was a reason why baseball was left more undeveloped than in other European countries like Italy or the Netherlands.\nDuring World War I, American soldiers played baseball in Germany but the first official game on German grounds took place in Berlin at the 1936 Olympics. The sport was introduced in a demonstration tournament where the United States was planned to play against other nations, including Japan. The ongoing economic depression caused other nations to cancel their arrangements for the tournament, leaving the Americans to play a split-squad exhibition game in front of the German audience on the last day of the Olympics. On August 12, 1936, the World Amateurs and the U.S. Olympics played at the Olympiastadion in front of 92,565 spectators. The stadium was not designed to accommodate baseball, leaving lights only into the air and Adolf Hitler's box in the right field fair territory. The World Amateurs won the game 6–5 in 7 innings on a walkoff-inside-the-park-homerun by Les McNeece.\nAfter the game, the players were congratulated and praised by Dr. Carl Diem, the secretary of the German Organization Committee. \"I have come officially to advise you that this has been the finest demonstration of any sport that any nation has ever put on at any Olympic Games,\" Diem said. After this event there were multiple teams that appeared around Berlin and even in southern Germany. When the war started though, the \"American pastime\" was no longer welcomed, and there was no more baseball played by Germans until after the war.\nDuring World War II.\nDuring World War II, baseball was played in many POW camps by American GIs, although it was mostly softball. There was difficulty obtaining equipment, and games were often played with modified rules. Baseball was seen as a morale-booster for POWs, and was played in almost every camp housing Americans; hundreds of teams played in organized leagues. As the war came to an end, baseball began to be played outside of POW camps. Several professional Major League and Negro league players took part in those military competitions, including Hall of Famers Warren Spahn and Leon Day, as well as six-time All-Star Ewell Blackwell. The games were mainly played for military personnel, and as a result had little impact on the native Germans.\n1945–1980.\nAfter World War II, Germany was divided into four occupation zones, one of which was controlled by the United States. One of their goals was to expose the German youth to the \"American way of life\". In order to do that they created the GYA (German Youth Activities), where they used baseball, basketball and American football (as well as already-popular sports like boxing, athletics and gymnastics) to teach them American values. In the years following the war, baseball flourished in certain parts of Germany, mainly in Berlin and in the south around cities like Mannheim, Ramstein, Stuttgart, Nuremberg and Munich. In the non-U.S. zones of Germany, baseball remained unknown. By 1948, there were 140 teams around Germany, and in 1949 the Frankfurt Juniors, the first German baseball club was founded. The Allgemeine Baseball-Foederation Deutschland (ABFD) was formed in 1950, and the first German championship tournament was held the following year. By 1954, there were several other European countries playing baseball, and Germany became one of the five founding members of the Confederation Europenne de Baseball Amateur. Germany played at the inaugural European Baseball Championship in 1954 where they placed fourth and last.\nIn the mid-1950s, many American troops returned to the United States, which had a negative impact on the popularity of baseball in Germany. The next generation were not exposed to the game, and many American coaches returned home. In the 1970s, Germany traveled to Managua, Nicaragua, twice to compete in the Baseball World Cup, but they failed to win a single game, placing last in both tournaments. In 1970, the ABFD was disbanded, and between 1969 and 1981 there was no national champion crowned. By 1979, there was only one club left, the Mannheim Tornados.\n1980 to now.\nIn 1980, a process to rebuild baseball in Germany began. That year, the German baseball community officially registered the Deutscher Baseball und Softball Verband (DBV) as the governing body with German authorities. The 1. Baseball Bundesliga was reformed in 1982 and is still active. The number of active players has grown from less than 2,000 in 1989 to almost 30,000 players today.\nThe 1. Baseball Bundesliga is one of the most competitive leagues in Europe, just below the Honkbal Hoofdklasse in the Netherlands and the Italian Baseball League. However, the Germans have not had a first or second place finish at the European Championship since the inaugural tournament in 1954. There have still been several German players that were able to sign with MLB clubs in the past 18 years, with Max Kepler and Donald Lutz being the two players to have played professionally at the highest level in the United States. It has been suggested that Kepler's success in particular could have an enormous impact on the popularity of baseball in Germany, as a role model for children. Since 2017, MLB games have been broadcast on German television, with the channels SPORT1, SPORT1 US and DAZN showing more than 75 games a season.\nBaseball Bundesliga.\nThe Baseball Bundesliga, established in 1984, is the highest German baseball league. It is divided into two levels, 1. Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga, each with two divisions (North and South) containing five to eight teams each. The regular season is played between March and July, followed by a playoff postseason.\nThe Mannheim Tornados are the only team that has played in the league since its inception. They also, as of 2018, have the most national titles (10), followed by the Paderborn Untouchables (6) and the Buchbinder Legionäre Regensburg (5).\nGermans in MLB.\nAmerican-born players with German ancestry.\nGerman Americans comprise a significant percentage of players in baseball history. Between 1871 and 1875 they made up 30% of players, and between 1900 and 1920 roughly 28% of players were of German heritage. Famous German American players include:\nGerman-born players in MLB.\nIn total, there have been 44 German-born players who have played in Major League Baseball. Of those, 25 played in the Majors before 1933, and 11 players played between 1933 and 1999. During the latter time period, only one German-born player appeared in a Major League All-Star Game, Glenn Hubbard, a former second baseman and later on a first base coach with the Atlanta Braves. Since 2000, eight German-born players have appeared in MLB, one of whom is Edwin Jackson. Jackson was an MLB All-Star in 2009 and threw a no-hitter on June 25, 2010. In 2018, he also tied a Major League Baseball record when he made a pitching appearance for his 13th Major League team, then, in 2019, played with his 14th different team, the Toronto Blue Jays.\nGerman-developed players in MLB.\nBrothers Klaus and Jürgen Helmig were the first German-developed players to sign a professional baseball contract. In 1956, after practicing daily and playing alongside military teams for several years, they received an offer from the Baltimore Orioles. The Orioles wanted to use this signing for press exposure, leading to the Helmig brothers receiving media attention upon their arrival in the United States. They were invited to the White House and visited the Annual Baseball Writers' Association dinner where they were special guests. Their baseball careers in the minor leagues did not last long, as they were released by the Orioles after a couple of months. Instead, they started playing for the Baltimore Elite Stars in the Negro leagues. They are credited with being two of the few white players to ever play in the Negro leagues. At the end of the 1956 summer, they returned to Germany, where they continued their baseball careers until 1978. They were elected into the in 2006.\nIn 2000, Mitch Franke became the first player from the German baseball Bundesliga to sign a professional contract with an MLB organization, the Milwaukee Brewers. He never made it to the top, but he opened the doors for other Germans like pitcher Tim Henkenjohann, who played in the Minnesota Twins organization between 2002 and 2005, and catcher Simon Gühring, a player in the Milwaukee Brewers organization in 2002 and 2003. Since 2007, there have been multiple German-developed players that signed professional contracts. Most of them only played a few seasons with different minor league teams, before returning to Germany. They include:\nIn April 2013, outfielder Donald Lutz became the first German-developed player to play in Major League Baseball when he made his debut for the Cincinnati Reds.\nMax Kepler of the Minnesota Twins also trained in his native Germany before being signed by the Twins at age 16, making his major league debut six years later, in 2015. He has since been a consistent force in the Minnesota Twins lineup, hitting 56 homeruns between 2016 and 2018.\nGerman Baseball Hall of Fame.\nThe National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum is a key component of America's national pastime, which is why the German Baseball and Softball Federation launched the in 1994. It honors those people who have excelled as players, managers, or officials and who have been vital to the development of German baseball. To this date, the German Baseball Hall of Fame has 19 members."

        "title": "2019 NRL Grand Final",
        "text": "The 2019 NRL Grand Final was the conclusive and premiership-deciding game of the 2019 National Rugby League season and was played at Sydney's ANZ Stadium. The match was contested between defending premiers the Sydney Roosters and the Canberra Raiders. The match was won by the Sydney Roosters 14–8 in a tight contest to claim their 15th premiership title, making them the first club in 26 years to win consecutive premierships in a unified competition since the Brisbane Broncos in 1993, and the first Sydney Roosters side to win consecutive titles since 1975. The Clive Churchill Medal was awarded to Raiders five-eighth Jack Wighton as the game's man of the match.\nThe game is one of the most controversial grand finals, infamous for a reversed \"six again\" decision by referee Ben Cummins which preceded the winning try.\nBackground.\nSydney finished second on the premiership ladder with a record of 17–7. The club comfortably defeated South Sydney 30–6 to qualify for the preliminary final, then defeated minor premiers Melbourne 14–6 in the preliminary final to qualify for the grand final. Having won the 2018 premiership, the Roosters were aiming to win back-to-back premierships, and become the first team since the Brisbane Broncos in the 1992-93 NSWRL to do so in a unified competition. Trent Robinson coached the side to its third grand final in his seventh year coaching the Roosters.\nCanberra finished fourth on the premiership ladder with a 15–9 record. The club won through to the grand final with a 12–10 win over Melbourne in the qualifying final, then a 16–10 win over South Sydney in the preliminary final. It was the club's first grand final appearance since 1994, breaking the longest drought of appearances in club history. Raiders coach Ricky Stuart was coaching his first grand final for Canberra in his sixth year with the club; it was his fourth grand final as a coach overall, having led the Roosters to the game in 2002, 2003 and 2004.\nIt was the first time the Sydney Roosters and the Canberra Raiders contested a Grand Final. The sides faced each other twice during the season, with the Roosters winning both games: a 30–24 win in round 9 on the neutral Suncorp Stadium during Magic Round, and a 22–18 win at GIO Stadium in round 21.\nTeams.\nBrett Morris, Sam Verrills, Angus Crichton, Nat Butcher were the only new additions to the Roosters' grand final winning squad from the previous year. For the Canberra Raiders, all but one of their players played in their first NRL grand final, with centre Joseph Leilua having played for the Roosters in the 2010 Premiership decider; their second-row forward John Bateman had their most first grade grand final experience, having played in four Super League grand finals for the Wigan Warriors.\nSydney Roosters halfback Cooper Cronk was playing his 372nd and final game(323 of which were for the Melbourne Storm), retiring as the second most-capped NRL player in the competition's history. The match was his ninth first grade grand final, making him the first player since Ron Coote in 1975 to reach that mark; only Norm Provan and Brian Clay had played in more grand finals, with ten apiece. Having won premierships with Melbourne in 2017 and Sydney in 2018 and 2019, he became the first player since nine members of the Parramatta Eels 1981–83 teams to be involved in three straight premiership victories.\nOfficials.\nThe officiating team, comprising two referees, two touch judges, two review officials and a stand-by in each position is given below. All four on-field officials, Ben Cummins, Gerard Sutton, Nick Beashel and Chris Butler, had officiated in previous NRL grand finals.\n\"Numbers in brackets represent the number of grand finals officiated, including 2019.\"\nMatch summary.\nFirst half.\nUnfortunate circumstances robbed Canberra of an early scoring chance in the 3rd minute: Canberra prop Sia Soliola charged down Luke Keary's fifth tackle kick, but the ball bounced back off Roosters trainer Travis Touma, who was jogging around seven metres behind play. With no Roosters in the backfield and Raiders' second-rower Elliott Whitehead in best position to pursue the ball, Canberra would have been in a strong position to chase down an opening try; but, instead, the incident fell under the 'mutual interference' rule, resulting in a scrum feed to the Roosters, since the incident occurred in its defensive half. From the ensuring set of six, the Roosters earned a repeat set and attacked the Canberra line: Boyd Cordner crossed but was held up in the 5th minute, before Sam Verrills scored the first try of the game in the 7th minute, grounding the ball next to the posts with a 10m run from dummy-half. Latrell Mitchell converted, and the Roosters led 6–0.\nFollowing the opening try, Canberra gained the territory advantage and made several attacking raids, including a bargeover attempt by Whitehead in the 11th minute which was held up, and several attacking bomb kicks; however, Canberra was unable to find the tryline. During this period, Roosters forward Mitchell Aubusson left the field with a match-ending knee injury. In the 19th minute, as Sydney advanced, Canberra's Joseph Tapine tackled Sydney's Victor Radley high, and Mitchell converted a 35-metre penalty to extend the lead to 8–0.\nIn the 30th minute, Canberra earned a repeat set after Sydney Roosters full-back James Tedesco fumbled an aerial contest for a bomb kick 10m from his defensive try line. On the next tackle, Jack Wighton broke the line between Sydney Roosters defenders Boyd Cordner and Angus Crichton to score Canberra's first try. Jarrod Croker converted to reduce the margin to 8–6.\nThe Canberra side fumbled the first play-the-ball after the restart, giving the Sydney Roosters the territory advantage, but several attacking raids came up short. In the last seconds before half-time before half time, Croker was penalised for interfering with Brett Morris in the chase for an attacking bomb; Mitchell's kick from near the sideline missed, and the half-time margin was 8–6.\nSecond half.\nCanberra dominated the game for the early part of the second half, with several near scoring chances in the first ten minutes. In the 50th minute, as John Bateman attempted a close-quarters pass near the posts to Josh Papalii, who was tackled by retiring Sydney half-back Cooper Cronk before the pass arrived; the referee sent Cronk to the sin bin for ten minutes for a professional foul, and asked the bunker to review for a possible penalty try, which it ruled against. Croker leveled the score at 8–8 from the penalty kick. During Cronk's ten minutes off the field, Canberra continued to dominate possession, but were held out by the Roosters; their only close scoring chance came in the 60th minute, when a chain of fifth tackle passes to the right wing put Brett Morris over in the corner, but was called back when Joseph Leilua's final flick pass was forward.\nIn the 67th minute, a pass by Radley saw Sio Siua Taukeiaho break the line to swing territory in Sydney's favour; and soon after winning a repeat set from a bomb kick, the Roosters won a penalty for a high tackle against Canberra's Aidan Sezer on Luke Keary. Mitchell missed the wide angle kick, and the score remained 8–8.\nThe game's most controversial moment came in the 71st minute. A Canberra fifth tackle bomb kick was contested in the air 10m from the try line, and bounced backwards off the Canberra chaser's shoulder to Josh Hodgson. Controlling referee Ben Cummins, believing the ball had hit Sydney full-back James Tedesco, signalled and called 'six again'; seconds later, on the advice of assistant referee Gerard Sutton and touch judge Chris Butler, he changed the signal and call to fifth tackle. The play ended with Jack Wighton, who did not hear or see the changed call, and he took a safe tackle rather than launch another fifth-tackle attacking option, resulting in a changeover.\nFrom the ensuing set, on fourth tackle, Latrell Mitchell broke the line down the left wing at midfield with a flick pass to Daniel Tupou which ended with a try to James Tedesco. Mitchell converted, and the Roosters took a 14–8 lead. An even contest ensued over the last six minutes, the Sydney Roosters able to defend its lead and win the game, 14–8.\nOverall.\nCanberra was considered to have played better overall, with more scoring opportunities and territory, but was unable to convert this into a winning score. Overall, the Raiders held 54% of possession. They played with much greater variation in attack, throwing 19 offloads to Sydney's 1, and launching 15 bomb and grubber kicks to Sydney's 9. The Clive Churchill Medal for man of the match was awarded to Canberra five-eighth Jack Wighton, who scored one try and led the Raiders' kicking game.\nThe win made the Sydney Roosters the first club since the Brisbane Broncos in 1992 and 1993 NSWRL seasons to win back-to-back premierships in a unified competition, and the first ever in the post-schism NRL competition. It was the first time the Roosters had won consecutive titles since 1974 and 1975.\nThe game is widely remembered for Cummins erroneous 'six again' call and the impact it had leading up to the winning try. Following the game, the NRL acknowledged the error and regretted the confusion it caused, while also confirming that the eventual call of fifth tackle was correct and endorsing Cummins' right to change his call on the advice of his assistant referees. Nevertheless, the call drew condemnation from Raiders' and neutral observers. Many analysts also disputed the league's endorsement of Cummins' right to change the call, citing NRL Law 16.9 which allows a judgement call to be changed on another referee's advice only in the event of foul play.\nThe game's other controversial decisions – the 'mutual interference' with the Roosters' trainer, and the sin binning of Cooper Cronk – were both also endorsed by the league's review. However, the 'mutual interference' rule was acknowledged to be an outdated rule, remnant from an era when territory was more valuable than possession.\nCurtain-raisers.\nTwo opening matches were played on the ground prior to the grand final: the NRL State Championship – in which the Newtown Jets scored a try as time expired to snatch victory from the Burleigh Bears – and the NRL Women's Grand Final, won comfortably by the Brisbane Broncos Women's. Pre-match entertainment was headlined by American pop rock band OneRepublic. Natalie Bassingthwaighte performed the Advance Australia Fair. The match was broadcast live throughout Australia by the Nine Network."

        "text": "The 1949–50 Colorado College Tigers men's ice hockey team represented the Colorado College in intercollegiate college ice hockey during the 1949–50 NCAA men's ice hockey season. The head coach was Cheddy Thompson and the team captain was Milo Yalich. The team won the 1950 NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. The team's leading scorer was Harry Whitworth, who finished third in the nation with 60 points.\nSeason.\nColorado College entered the 1949–50 season looking for a bit of redemption after they lost their first three NCAA tournament games over the previous two seasons. With returning senior Milo Yalich named as team captain, the team opened on the road against the Wichita All-Stars before hosting the same team the following week. The first game was a close affair, with the Tigers winning 5–4 but the next three matches were easily won by Cheddy Thompson's team. The Tigers stayed at home until mid-January and used that advantage to win their first 10 games of the season. The visiting UBC Thunderbirds spoiled their perfect record, handing the Tigers their first two losses of the year but that series was sandwiched between two weekends against the brand new Denver program that was hopelessly outmatched by Colorado College. CC took all four games against their future rival by a combined score of 50–4. After splitting two games during a trip up to Minnesota the Tigers met their biggest competition in the west, the Michigan Wolverines.\nCC had lost five of their previous six meetings against the Wolverines and hadn't beaten Michigan since 1946. In the first game Michigan shut down the high-powered CC offense, holding the Tigers to a season-low one goal in a 5–1 CC loss. The next day turned out even worse for the Tigers when they were trounced by Michigan 11–1. The bitter taste of those two losses remained in the team's mouth for two weeks but once they returned to the ice the team was able to take some of their frustration out on Minnesota, winning two games to end the regular season. While Michigan had the best record by far, Colorado College and North Dakota were in contention for the second western seed. While their two records were very similar (15–6–2 vs. 16–5–1) the series the two played against one another ended in CC's favor and was likely the deciding factor in sending the Tigers back to the NCAA tournament.\nThe Tigers welcomed Boston College in the semifinal and, after BC opened the scoring early in the first, Colorado College produced what was then the most lopsided victory in tournament history. The Tigers' Carl Lawrence gave the team its first lead and then proceeded to score four more times before the game was over. Ron Hartwell, Tony Frasca, Chris Ray and Bill MacDonald also hit the net as CC rolled to a 10–3 win, their first tournament victory. In the championship game CC faced off against Boston University who were in their first season playing varsity ice hockey and led by the nation's leading scorer Jack Garrity. Once again the Tigers surrendered the first goal and went into the second period down 1–0. CC remained off the score sheet until about midway through the game when they notched two goals in the span of 18 seconds and followed it up with a third just over six minutes later. With the game close through two periods there was still hope for both teams but, when Ron Hartwell scored 52 seconds in, the championship appeared to be slipping away from BU. Chris Ray built the lead to 4 before future Hall of Famer Jack Kelley made the score 5–2. After that brief respite the CC offense went on a rampage and scored seven goals in just under 7 minutes of game time with all but one coming from different players. Three more goals were scored before the game ended but the outcome had already been decided and Colorado College skated away with their first national championship.\nCC set numerous records over the course of the season. With their 190 goals coming in only 24 games the team averaged just under 8 goals per game (7.91) which is the best rating in history for an NCAA champion . Colorado College twice broke the record for largest margin of victory in the NCAA tournament, winning 10–3 in their first game (+7) and 13–4 in their second (+9). As of 2018 the championship game has the second-widest margin (1961). The 13 goals CC scored in the championship set a record for most in any tournament game that was broken by Michigan in 1953 and remains a record for a championship game (tied with the 1957 CC team). The 23 goals scored in the tournament was a record that was not broken until the tournament expanded to at last double the number of games for a championship team, but still remains a record for any team in the Frozen Four. The +16 total goal differential is still a record for a single tournament that is shared by Michigan in 1953 and Wisconsin in 1983.\nStandings.\nSchedule.\nDuring the season Colorado College compiled an 18–5–1 record, and was selected for the NCAA tournament for the third consecutive year.\n1950 national championship.\n(W2) Colorado College vs. (E2) Boston University.\nJim Starrak and Tony Frasca were named to the All-Tournament First Team while Roy Ikola and Ron Hartwell were on the All-Tournament Second Team"
