Tiger Field is on the corner of Market Street and Cypress Ave.\nThe stadium has gone through many renovations over the years. In the 1940s and 1950s, the stadium had a large wooden grandstand. Soon after the folding of the Redding Browns and a fire in the grandstands in 1955, the grandstands were torn down and the stadium orientation was flipped so that the current location of home plate is in the original location of right field.\nIn 2016 the stadium received a major upgrade and face lift. The field was re-sodded, the backstop was moved up, new backstop nets were installed, new stadium seats from the former Travis Credit Union Park in Vacaville, California, were installed, and the dugouts were renovated and expanded."

        "title": "2020 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting",
        "text": "Elections to the National Baseball Hall of Fame for 2020 proceeded according to rules most recently amended in 2016. As in the past, the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from a ballot of recently retired players. The results were announced on January 21, 2020, with Derek Jeter and Larry Walker elected to the Hall of Fame.\nThe Modern Baseball Era Committee, one of four voting panels that since 2016 have taken over the role of the more broadly defined Veterans Committee, convened at the Major League Baseball Winter Meetings in December 2019 to select from a ballot of retired players and non-playing personnel who made their greatest contributions to the sport in the 1970–1987 period. The committee elected former player Ted Simmons and former executive Marvin Miller.\nThe formal induction ceremony was to be held at the Hall's facilities in Cooperstown, New York, on July 26, 2020. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the 2020 induction ceremony was canceled. Inductees from 2020 were honored during ceremonies on September 8, 2021.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA election rules were largely identical to those that were in effect for the most recent elections. The most recent change to BBWAA voting rules, announced in 2015, tightened the qualifications for the BBWAA electorate. Beginning with the 2016 election, eligible voters must not only have 10 years of continuous BBWAA membership, but also be currently active members. When these changes were announced, the pool of eligible voters also included those who had held active status within the 10 years prior to the election. A BBWAA member who has not been active for more than 10 years can regain voting status by covering MLB in the year preceding the election. However, as of the 2020 balloting process, the BBWAA and Hall of Fame have apparently redefined \"active membership\" to remove the vote from anyone who did not cover MLB games for two years, instead of 10.\nOn November 18, 2019, the Hall of Fame released the list of players on the ballot. The ballot included two categories of players:\nUnofficial voting totals were tracked online.\nA total of 397 ballots were cast, with 298 votes needed to reach the 75% threshold for election. A total of 2613 votes were cast for individual players, an average of 6.58 votes per ballot, a sharp decline from the year earlier. Derek Jeter fell one vote short of becoming the second player unanimously elected, a feat first (and to date, only) accomplished by Mariano Rivera, when elected in 2019. Larry Walker became the seventh player in the modern voting era (since 1966) to be elected in his final ballot, after Red Ruffing, Joe Medwick, Ralph Kiner, Jim Rice, Tim Raines, and Edgar Martínez.\nPlayers who met first-year eligibility requirements but were \"not\" selected by the screening committee for inclusion on the ballot included: Mike Adams, Jason Bartlett, Erik Bedard, John Buck, Shawn Camp, Ronny Cedeño, Endy Chavez, Greg Dobbs, Ryan Doumit, Scott Downs, Mark Ellis, Kyle Farnsworth, Frank Francisco, Álex González, Matt Guerrier, Scott Hairston, Koyie Hill, Maicer Izturis, Jason Kubel, Brandon League, Ryan Ludwick, Paul Maholm, John McDonald, Nate McLouth, José Molina, Xavier Nady, Miguel Olivo, Lyle Overbay, Nick Punto, Humberto Quintero, Guillermo Quiroz, Ramón Santiago, Joe Saunders, Marco Scutaro, Luis Valbuena, Josh Willingham and Jamey Wright.\nThe Hall itself apparently treated Jeter's induction as a foregone conclusion; since shortly after Jeter's retirement, it maintained a page on its official website that included the following statement:While nothing is ever assured when it comes to election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame (after all, it is the responsibility of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America to vote on each year’s candidates), who among us would doubt that Jeter is a sure-fire first-ballot choice when he becomes eligible in 2020?\nThe BBWAA announced the results of its 2020 Hall of Fame balloting on January 21, 2020.\nModern Baseball Era Committee.\nOn July 23, 2016, the Hall of Fame announced changes to the Era Committee system. The system's timeframes were restructured to place a greater emphasis on the modern game, and to reduce the frequency at which individuals from the pre-1970 game (including Negro league baseball figures) will have their careers reviewed. Considering candidates whose greatest contributions occurred from 1970 to 1987, the Modern Baseball Era Committee met in 2019 as part of the elections for the next calendar year.\nThe Historical Overview Committee, which determined the Modern Baseball Era ballot in the fall, was composed of 11 veteran historians: Bob Elliott (Canadian Baseball Network); Jim Henneman (formerly Baltimore Sun); Rick Hummel (St. Louis Post-Dispatch); Steve Hirdt (formerly Elias Sports Bureau); Bill Madden (formerly New York Daily News); Jack O'Connell (BBWAA); Jim Reeves (formerly Fort Worth Star-Telegram); Tracy Ringolsby (InsideTheSeams.com); Glenn Schwarz (formerly San Francisco Chronicle); Dave van Dyck (formerly Chicago Tribune); and Mark Whicker (Los Angeles News Group).\nThe cutoff for election to the Hall of Fame remained the standard 75%; as the Modern Baseball Era Committee consisted of 16 members, 12 votes was the minimum for selection. The 16-member Hall of Fame Board-appointed electorate charged with the review of the Modern Baseball Era featured Hall of Fame members George Brett, Rod Carew, Dennis Eckersley, Eddie Murray, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount; major league executives Sandy Alderson, Dave Dombrowski, David Glass, Walt Jocketty, Doug Melvin and Terry Ryan; and veteran media members/historians Bill Center, Steve Hirdt, Jack O’Connell and Tracy Ringolsby.\nThe 2019 vote elected former catcher Ted Simmons, and Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) leader Marvin Miller, who died in 2012. Simmons and Miller each received at least 75% of the votes, earning election to the Hall of Fame. Those not elected remain potential candidates for the next Modern Era Committee ballot for 2023.\n was previously a 2018 candidate\n&lt;br&gt;\nSource:\nThe prior Modern Baseball Era Committee balloting in selected Jack Morris and Alan Trammell to the Hall of Fame. Considered, but not elected, on that ballot were players Steve Garvey, Tommy John, Don Mattingly, Dale Murphy, Dave Parker, Luis Tiant, and Simmons. Also on that ballot was Miller, the former leader of the MLBPA. Of those eight, Simmons came within one vote (11) of being elected, while Miller had seven votes; the other six candidates each received less than seven votes, as their vote totals were not released to the public.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nThe J. G. Taylor Spink Award has been presented by the BBWAA at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1962. Through 2010, it was awarded during the main induction ceremony, but is now given the previous day at the Hall of Fame Awards Presentation. It recognizes a sportswriter \"for meritorious contributions to baseball writing\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of Fame but are featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum.\nThe three finalists for the 2020 award were announced on July 9, 2019, during the All-Star break:\nOf the finalists, only Cafardo was deceased at the time of the announcement. Reeves and Reusse had both been finalists in 2018 and 2019; Reeves had also been a finalist in 2017. On December 10, 2019, Cafardo was named the 2020 award recipient.\nReceiving the Spink Award entitles a baseball writer to eligibility for the Historical Oversight Committee, which selects the 10 candidates to be voted on by the applicable 16 member Eras Committee of the Hall of Fame. The number of Spink Award recipients who choose to participate on an Oversight Committee varies according to the interest and availability of these generally retired sports writers. Given that the 2017 and 2020 awards went to deceased writers, it is possible that only one new member, (Sheldon Ocker, 2018), will sit on the committee which meets in 2020 to make up the ballot to be considered by the 2020/21 Golden Age Era Committee.\nFord C. Frick Award.\nVarious changes in July 2016 were also made to the annual Ford C. Frick Award elections, presented annually to a preeminent baseball broadcaster since 1978. According to the Hall, the new criteria for selection are \"Commitment to excellence, quality of broadcasting abilities, reverence within the game, popularity with fans, and recognition by peers.\"\nAdditionally, a ballot of eight candidates is now set, down from 10 in years past. The three ballot slots previously determined by fan voting on Facebook are now filled by a committee of historians.\nA new election cycle has been established, rotating annually between \"Current Major League Markets\" (team-specific announcers) with the 2017 Frick Award; \"National Voices\" (broadcasters whose contributions were realized on a national level) with the 2018 Frick Award; and \"Broadcasting Beginnings\" (early team voices and pioneers of baseball broadcasting) with the 2019 Frick Award. Since this cycle repeats every three years, all finalists for the 2020 award were team-specific announcers.\nThe Hall announced finalists for the 2020 Ford C. Frick Award on November 1, 2019. Of the finalists, the only one not living at that time was Ned Martin, who died in 2002. Ken \"Hawk\" Harrelson was announced as the winner on December 11.\nBuck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award.\nAnother Hall of Fame honor, the Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award, will be presented at the 2020 Awards Presentation. The award was created in 2008 in honor of Buck O'Neil, a Negro leagues star who went on to become one of baseball's leading ambassadors until his death in 2006. The first award was presented posthumously to O'Neil at the 2008 induction ceremony, and has since been presented three additional times, most recently to Rachel Robinson in 2017. According to the Hall,The Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award is presented by the Hall of Fame's Board of Directors not more than once every three years to honor an individual whose extraordinary efforts enhanced baseball's positive impact on society, broadened the game's appeal, and whose character, integrity and dignity are comparable to the qualities exhibited by O'Neil.\nOn March 5, 2020, the Hall announced David Montgomery as the 2020 recipient. Before his death in 2019, Montgomery had worked in the Philadelphia Phillies organization for over 40 years, starting in the sales office staff and eventually becoming CEO and part-owner. After his retirement from full-time executive work in 2015, he served as the franchise's largely ceremonial chairman. During his career with the Phillies, he played a major role in the team's community service efforts, both in the Delaware Valley and in the areas of its minor-league teams.\nAs with the media awards, recipients are not members of the Hall of Fame but are permanently recognized by the Hall. In this case, the recipients are listed alongside a life-size statue of O'Neil that stands at the entrance to the museum. Written nominations for the award are accepted by mail at any time; the nomination must specifically state how the nominee meets the traits exemplified by O'Neil."

        "text": "James Alvin Stewart (born December 8, 1971) is a former American football running back in the National Football League (NFL) who played for the Minnesota Vikings in 1995.\nBiography.\nStewart played high school football at Vero Beach High School in Vero Beach, Florida, where he rushed for 1,932 yards in his senior season. Heavily recruited by college football programs, Stewart decided to attend the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida. He redshirted in 1991, and did not play in 1992 due to a shoulder injury. He then played a total of 20 games for the Miami Hurricanes in 1993 and 1994, rushing for 1,328 yards and 17 touchdowns. While at Miami, he was teammates with Warren Sapp. The 1994 Hurricanes reached the Bowl Coalition's championship game for that season, the 1995 Orange Bowl, where Stewart rushed for 72 net yards as Miami lost to Nebraska, 24–17.\nStewart was selected in the fifth round of the 1995 NFL Draft by the Minnesota Vikings. With the 1995 Vikings, he appeared in four games, rushing for 144 yards on 31 carries. He sustained a broken fibula in a November game against the New Orleans Saints, and did not play again that season. During the 1996 preseason, Stewart again broke the same bone, against the same team, the Saints. He was subsequently placed on injured reserve, missing the season. Stewart was released by the Vikings in August 1997. He would return to play for the Miami Tropics of the short lived Spring Football League in 2000.\nIn April 2002, Stewart was indicted on counterfeit currency charges after being found in possession of counterfeit bills during a traffic stop. June 2003, Stewart pleaded guilty to federal charges related to cocaine distribution. He was subsequently sentenced to four years and four months in federal prison."

        "text": "The 1988 Winter Olympics torch relay was run from November 15, 1987, to February 13, 1988, prior to the Calgary 1988 Winter Olympics.\nOrganization.\nThe planning of the Torch Relay required significant research and testing, with each kilometer of the relay test-driven three times, and estimates that each torch bearer would travel at a speed of 7 km/h. The relay kept to secondary highways as much as possible and used Snowmobiles for 2,750 km between Shanty Bay, Ontario and Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. Overall the torch travelled approximately 11,000 km on land and 7,000 km by air or sea.\nRelay sponsor Petro Canada issued entry forms allowing citizens the chance to become one of 6,214 people to carry the torch for , torch bears were either chosen on merit or selected through random draws. Organizers, who initially expected to receive 250,000 entries, were inundated with over 6.6 million forms and called the response a sign that the Olympics had \"fired the imagination of Canada\". Part of the success for the number of applications was the OCO in February 1987 sending approximately 10 million applications out to virtually every Canadian household. The relay, called \"Share the Flame\", also saw the torch travel by boat, snowmobile and dogsled.\nThe Olympic Torch relay involved a convoy of 80 people in 40 support vehicles travelling 125 kilometers per day.\nRelay.\nThe Olympic torch relay began when the torch was lit at Olympia and Greek runner Stelios Bisbas began what was called \"the longest torch run in history\". The flame arrived in St. John's, Newfoundland on the Atlantic Ocean two days later and over 88 days, traveled west across Canada. It passed through each provincial capital and many major cities, north to the Arctic Ocean at Inuvik, Northwest Territories, then west to the Pacific Ocean at Victoria, British Columbia before returning east to Alberta, and finally Calgary. The route was designed in a way that 90 per cent of Canadians lived within a 2-hour drive of the route. The torch covered a distance of , the greatest distance for a torch relay in Olympic history until the 2000 Sydney Games, and a sharp contrast to the 1976 Montreal Games when the relay covered only .\nThe identity of the final torchbearer who would light the Olympic cauldron was one of OCO'88's most closely guarded secrets. The relay began at St. John's with Barbara Ann Scott, a 1948 gold medalist in figure skating and Ferd Hayward, the first Newfoundlander to represent Canada at an Olympic games in 1952, both representing Canada's past Olympians. The relay and ended with Ken Read and Cathy Priestner carrying the torch into McMahon Stadium representing the nation's current Olympians. They then stopped to acknowledge the contribution of para-athlete Rick Hansen and his \"Man in Motion\" tour before handing the torch to 12-year-old Robyn Perry, an aspiring figure skater who was selected to represent future Olympians, to light the cauldron. The choice of Perry was an unusual departure from most Games as the cauldron has typically been lit by a famous individual or group from the host nation.\nProtest.\nThe relay was subject to peaceful protests by members and supporters of the Lubicon Cree First Nation at several stops in Ontario and Alberta in protest of ongoing land claim disputes between the band and the Crown, as well as discontent over an exhibit at Calgary's Glenbow Museum called \"The Spirit Sings\" that featured numerous artifacts stolen from native land.\nOlympic Torch.\nThe design of the Olympic Torch for the Calgary games was influenced by the landmark building of the Calgary skyline, the Calgary Tower. The National Research Council Canada developed the design for the Torch, which was constructed of maple, aluminum, and hardened steel, entirely Canadian materials, the torch was designed to remain lit despite the sometimes adverse conditions of Canadian winters. The Torch had to be light enough for relay runners to carry comfortably, and the final design came in at 60 centimeters in length and 1.7 kilograms in weight. The maple handle portion included laser-incised pictograms of the 10 official Olympic Winter sports, and lettering was engraved on the steel cauldron portion. The torch used a combination of gasoline, kerosene and alcohol to allow a continuous burn during the unpredictable Canadian winter. Approximately 100 torches were manufactured for the Games.\nThe Calgary Tower itself was retrofitted to install a cauldron at its peak and was lit for the duration of the Games, one of several \"replica cauldrons\" constructed at Olympic venues throughout Calgary and Canmore."

        "text": "Anthony Edwards (born August 5, 2001), nicknamed \"Ant-Man\" or simply \"Ant\", is an American professional basketball player for the Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball Association (NBA). A shooting guard, he played college basketball for the University of Georgia Bulldogs and was selected with the first overall pick by the Timberwolves in the 2020 NBA draft.\nEdwards finished his high school career at Holy Spirit Preparatory School in his hometown of Atlanta, where he was rated a consensus five-star recruit and one of the best players in the 2019 class by major recruiting services. As a senior, he earned McDonald's All-American and \"USA Today\" All-USA first team honors. He committed to play college basketball for Georgia, becoming the highest rated recruit to do so, and was named SEC Freshman of the Year after his freshman season with the team.\nEarly life.\nEdwards spent his early life in Atlanta, Georgia. When he was three years old, he was given the nickname \"Ant\" by his father. For much of his childhood, Edwards played football in the running back, quarterback, and cornerback positions. He played youth football for the Atlanta Vikings and became one of the best Pop Warner running backs in the country by age 10. However, Edwards switched his focus to basketball because he \"thought it looked more fun\" after watching his brothers play the sport. He often played basketball against his brothers at their grandmother's house. Entering ninth grade, he began training under the guidance of Justin Holland, a former college basketball player for Liberty and an Atlanta-based basketball trainer.\nHigh school career.\nDue to his success with the Atlanta Xpress 15-under Amateur Athletic Union team, Edwards was considered a four-star recruit by Rivals in 2016. He began playing high school basketball for Therrell High School in Atlanta as a member of the 2019 class. In early January 2017, Edwards transferred to Holy Spirit Preparatory School in Atlanta and reclassified to the 2020 class. He made the move in an effort to improve his academic performance, since Holy Spirit Preparatory had \"small class sizes and support to help that.\"\nIn March 2018, Edwards helped Holy Spirit Preparatory defeat The Heritage School for the Georgia Independent School Association (GISA) Class AAA state championship. He reclassified back to the 2019 class in November 2018 after seeing academic improvement.

On February 11, 2019, he committed to play college basketball for Georgia, becoming the program's best recruit in the modern recruiting era. Edwards chose the Bulldogs over offers from Florida State, Kansas, Kentucky, and North Carolina. Edwards was drawn to Georgia because two of his favorite players, Dwyane Wade and Victor Oladipo, had been coached in college by head coach Tom Crean.\nCollege career.\nOn November 5, 2019, Edwards made his debut for the Georgia Bulldogs, recording 24 points, nine rebounds, and four steals in a 91–72 win over Western Carolina.

        "text": "Three cities submitted bids to host the 1999 Pan American Games that were recognized by the Pan American Sports Organization. The voting took place on July 31, 1994, in Guayaquil, Ecuador.\nHost city selection.\nAny country that had previously held the games was allotted two votes; those countries were Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, the United States, and Venezuela, making 50 votes in total, and a city needed a majority vote (26) to win. Canada, Colombia, and Dominican Republic delegates with bidding cities in the process couldn't vote. \nAfter the first round of voting, Bogotá was eliminated with 10 votes. In the second round, Winnipeg and Santo Domingo tied with 25 votes. During the tiebreaker round, the Canadian Bidding Committee Co-Chairman Don Mackenzie convinced three National Olympic Committee delegates, focusing on the fact that \"Santo Domingo had no place for water-skiing, but Portage la Prairie has one of the best water-skiing facilities in Canada.\" Winnipeg went on to defeat Santo Domingo by a vote of 28 to 22.\nCandidate cities.\nWinnipeg, Canada.\nIn 1988, a Winnipeg delegation announced that once it got approval from the Canadian Olympic Association the city was allowed to present a bid to the COA Executive Board. On December 5, 1992, Winnipeg secured the Canadian bidding rights, defeating Toronto by one vote. Other three Canadian cities in the running were Halifax, Edmonton, and Sherbrooke.\nIn an attempt to secure the Latin American votes, the bid committee hired the Uruguayan television host Carlos Garcia. Garcia, who lived in Toronto, was a very know host in Latin America and had strong relationships with many of the National Olympic Committee members in the Americas. Additionally, the city presented an original song, written and performed by Burton Cummings, during its presentation. Winnipeg went on to defeat Santo Domingo in the third round.\nSanto Domingo, Dominican Republic.\nFollowing the success of the 1986 Central American and Caribbean Games held in Santiago de los Caballeros, the then resident of the Dominican Republic Olympic Committee Dr. José Joaquín Puello announced a 13-point \"ten-year strategic plan,\" from 1989 to 1999, in which the last point was host the Pan American Games. The country gained support of then President of the Pan American Sports Organization Mario Vázquez Raña following thereafter; on June 24, 1986, Raña urged Puello to bid for Pan American Games.\nOn June 21, 1994, the then President of the Dominican Republic Joaquín Balaguer issued Decree 181–94, declaring that it was \"of national interest to obtain the rights to host the 1999 Pan American Games in Santo Domingo and therefore, all the official authorities of the country are asked to give their collaboration to the Dominican Olympic Committee (CODOM) to achieve this objective.\" President Balaguer also issued an emotional letter assembly that would meet in Guayaquil, in which a portion of it read, \"We want, again, to be protagonists of history. Just as we were the land that opened the doors to American civilization, to conclude the century with the sports festival of the Continent.\" The city plans were down when they lost the bid process to Winnipeg in the third round of voting.\nBogotá, Colombia.\nBogotá officially presented their bid to the Pan American Sports Organization on March 9, 1993. Bogotá had never held the Pan American Games; however, Cali held the 1971 Pan American Games. On November 16, 1993, the then Mayor Jaime Castro Castro was announced as the leader of Bogotá's hosting campaign for the 1999 Pan American Games during the 1993 Central American and Caribbean Games. Castro, under the slogan \"En Colombia todo está dispuesto\" (English: \"In Colombia, everything can happen\"), pitched to PASO that the city has fulfilled the commitments made to the international community, particularly in the sports field. The city fell short, however, as it was knocked out in the first round of voting."

        "text": "The West Indies women's cricket team played the Pakistan women's cricket team in Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates in January and February 2019. The tour consisted of three Women's One Day Internationals (WODIs) and three Women's Twenty20 Internationals (WT20Is). The WODI games were part of the 2017–20 ICC Women's Championship.\nThe WT20I matches were played in Karachi, Pakistan. The West Indies women's team were visiting Pakistan for the first time in fifteen years, their previous tour being in March 2004 for a seven-WODI series. The team arrived in Pakistan on 30 January, and were escorted by more than 500 policemen in bullet-proof buses to their hotel. The West Indies' WT20I captain, Merissa Aguilleira, said \"I'm pleased we can bring back cricket to Pakistan\". Following the conclusion of the tour, West Indies' bowler Shakera Selman said that it was an \"honour\" to help Pakistan to play in front of their home crowds and families.\nThe West Indies Women won the WT20I series 2–1. The second match ended in a tie, with the West Indies Women winning the Super Over. Pakistan's captain Bismah Maroof was injured in a practice session ahead of the WODI series. Javeria Khan captained the side in the first WODI in her absence. Pakistan Women won the WODI series 2–1, their first ever WODI series win against the West Indies Women."

        "text": "The 2019 Major League Lacrosse season was the 19th season of Major League Lacrosse. The regular season began on Friday, May 31 and ended on Sunday, September 22. It was the first time the league would ever begin its season after Memorial Day, allowing all players selected in the collegiate draft to play a full season. 2019 also marks the first time each team would play 16 games. The league has played a 14-game schedule since 2012. Additionally, the league returned to a Championship Weekend format instead of a two-week postseason for the first time since 2013. Championship Weekend was hosted in Denver with two semifinal games on Friday, October 4 and the 19th Steinfeld Cup was hosted at Dick's Sporting Goods Park October 6 on ESPN2.\nFor the third time in five years, the Denver Outlaws enter the season as defending Steinfeld Cup champions. They defeated the Dallas Rattlers 16–12 in the 2018 championship game in Charleston, South Carolina.\nOn April 1, the league announced that the Charlotte Hounds, Florida Launch, and Ohio Machine would not be participating in the 2019 season, with Charlotte set to return in 2021 and Florida and Ohio folding. An updated league schedule was released April 3. The league competed with only six teams, the fewest since 2011.\nBroadcast.\nAlong with the league's schedule release on November 29, 2018, MLL announced it will continue its partnership with ESPN and Lax Sports Network for the 2019 season. ESPN+ will broadcast a Game of the Week. The All Star Game in Annapolis will be broadcast on ESPN2 while the 2019 Steinfeld Cup will be broadcast on ESPNEWS.\nOn May 30, the league announced that 12 games and a weekly studio show would be broadcast on Stadium.\nOn June 14, the league announced a partnership expansion with ESPN, as ESPN Player will broadcast 18 games on an international streaming platform.\nAttendance.\nFor the first time since 2011, the league's average attendance per game would see an increase. Half of the six teams would see a boost in attendance, although the Denver Outlaws would record their worst attendance in team history. The Chesapeake Bayhawks would become the first attendance champion not named the Denver Outlaws since the Boston Cannons in 2012, and would draw 16,124 for their last regular season game on September 21. The Boston Cannons saw a 9% growth and announced two sellouts at their new home in Quincy, Massachusetts. The Atlanta Blaze, despite having to change stadiums midseason, would see a slight growth in attendance for the first time in their young history.\nCollegiate Draft.\nThe league hosted its collegiate draft on Saturday, March 9 in Charlotte at the NASCAR Hall of Fame. This was announced on January 23. Faceoff specialist Alex Woodall from Towson was drafted first overall by the Machine. The Chesapeake Bayhawks drafted one of the biggest names in college lacrosse, Pat Spencer with the seventh pick.\nRookie selection draft.\nWith the league contracting to six teams almost a month after the collegiate draft, questions were raised about what would happen to the players selected in the draft by Charlotte, Florida, and Ohio. On April 26, the league's remaining six teams held a dispersal draft for those collegiate athletes selected by the three suspended teams and any other eligible NCAA seniors. Top pick Alex Woodall (selected by Ohio) was picked up by the Blaze.\nDispersal draft.\nThe league held a dispersal draft on April 24 to accommodate for the rosters of the three teams who suspended operations earlier in the month. Notable player movement included Ben Williams (faceoff/defense) going to Atlanta, midfielder Nick Mariano signing with the Chesapeake Bayhawks, veteran midfielder Kevin Crowley and goalie Austin Kaut signing with the New York Lizards, and Dallas native attackman Bryce Wasserman going home to the Rattlers.\nAll Star Game.\nThe 2019 All Star Game took place on Saturday, July 27 at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland, home to the Chesapeake Bayhawks. It was broadcast on ESPN2. The 19th edition of the game the players were voted into the contest by MLL fans and then drafted into teams called Fire and Ice. Team captains were Rob Pannell with B.J. O'Hara as the coach (Fire) and Lyle Thompson with Bill Warder as the coach (Ice). Team Ice won by a sudden victory overtime goal by 21-year-old rookie Brendan Sunday 16–15. Even though Team Fire was defeated, Dylan Molloy of Fire earned the MVP honors with a check for $10,000 from sponsor New Balance. Molloy had 5 goals, 1 assist and 6 points.\nPlayoffs.\nFor the first time since 2013, the playoffs will have a Final Four format, with two semifinal games on Friday, October 4 and the championship game on Sunday, October 6. Four teams will make the postseason bracket. On July 15, Denver was announced as the host city. Peter Barton Stadium will host the two semifinal games and Dick's Sporting Goods Park will host the 19th Steinfeld Cup."

The teams would play each other annually as members of the Missouri Valley Conference from 1934 to 1996 and 2000–2005. The rivalry maintained a certain balance between the two schools until a run of Tulsa dominance in the rivalry culminating with 13 straight wins over Wichita State from 1993 to 2002. Since 2003, Wichita State has won 10 of their past 11 matchups with Tulsa. Losing only in 2015 as the No. 9 ranked team in the country.\nThe rivalry was fully renewed when Wichita State joined The American for all sports except football. In their first game since 1995 as conference-mates, the Golden Hurricane played the No. 5 ranked Shockers close, losing only by 3."

        "title": "Metachronal swimming",
        "text": "A metachronal swimming or metachronal rowing is the swimming technique used by animals with multiple pairs of swimming legs. In this technique, appendages are sequentially stroked in a back-to-front wave moving along the animal’s body. In literature, while metachronal rhythm or metachronal wave usually refer to the movement of cilia; metachronal coordination, metachronal beating, metachronal swimming or metachronal rowing usually refer to the leg movement of arthropods, such as mantis shrimp, copepods, antarctic krill etc. though all of them refer to the similar locomotion pattern.\nMetachronous indicates something not functioning or occurring synchronously, or occurring or starting at different times. This word is derived from Greek meta- μετά- meaning, occurring later than or in succession to : after, and -chronous -Χρόνος meaning, of (such) a time or period.\nSwimming legs should coordinate to avoid interference among appendage pairs. To accomplish this challenge, almost all free-swimming crustaceans adapted to some version of metachronism.\nSignificance.\nEcologically and economically important crustaceans such as copepods, krill, shrimp, crayfish, and lobsters use metachronal swimming for locomotion. Using this technique, animals propel significant portion of earth's aquatic biomass. As an example, the biomass of a sole metachronally swimming species, the Antarctic krill \"Euphausia superba\", is more than the total adult human biomass. Moreover, this technique is important from biomechanics point of view because it has been adapted to perform extreme swimming actions. The highest animal acceleration of 200 m/s^2, for example, belongs to the escape jump of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus. On the other hand, Antarctic krill uses metachronal swimming to efficiently migrate distances up to 10 km per day.\nIt is believed that, during power stroke appendages are subject to drag which creates forward thrust, during the recovery stroke appendages are folded towards body to reduce the drag. Furthermore, back-to-front swimming pattern is thought to be more efficient than front-to-back or synchronous pattern.\nExamples from nature.\nCilia in metazoa.\nKnight-Jones defines the types of metachronism in ciliary beat of metazoa depending on the relative direction of wave to the effective beat. If the effective beat is in the same direction as metachronal wave, then it is called as symplectic metachronal wave. If opposite, the wave is called antiplectic. There are cases where the wave is directed to the right or to the left of the effective beat. In these cases the metachronal wave is called dexioplectic if effective beat is to the right of the wave, and laeoplectic if effective beat is to the left of the wave.\nMantis shrimp.\nMantis shrimp have 5 pairs of pleopods which they use to swim. Kinematics of their swimming reveals metachronal pattern. Study by Campos et al. shows that the power stroke of the mantis shrimp (\"Odontodactylus Havanensis\") is metachronal, creating back-to-front wave motion. While power stroke is completed metachronally, recovery stroke occurs nearly synchronous. The same rowing pattern was observed by another study. Stein et al. also report the metachronal rowing in mantis shrimp in their study\nCopepods.\nMetachronism in copepods was observed by numerous studies. Copepods show metachronal beating pattern while foraging and escape movements. In this study by van Duren and Videler, it was observed that during foraging, copepods metachronally beat their first three mouth appendages (antennae, mandibular palps and maxillules) creating backward motion of water. During escape, their mouth appendages stop moving and swimming legs beat in a very fast metachronal rhythm, accelerating a jet of water backwards.\nSlow-motion video by Jiang and Kiorboe reveals the metachronal beating of legs of cyclopoid copepod Oithona davisae during jumping. In this video, last pair of legs initiate the power stroke followed by the adjacent pair. Power stroke ends with the first pair. While power stroke is metachronal, recovery stroke is near synchronous.  \nAntarctic krill.\nAntarctic krill swim in a metachronal fashion. They have several swimming modes which include hovering, fast-forward swimming and upside-down swimming. All these swimming modes have common metachronal pattern although their kinematics differ. Hovering (HOV), which is defined as the swimming mode corresponding to the body angles of 25-50° and normalized speeds less than half of a body length per second, is performed at lower pleopod amplitudes and lower beat frequencies as compared to fast-forward swimming (FFW). FFW is defined as the swimming mode corresponding to speeds higher than 2 body lengths per second without restriction to body angles. Typical swimming speeds in this study was found as 0.25, 4 and 1.6 body lengths per second, and typical beat frequencies were found as 3, 6.2 and 3.8 Hz for hovering, fast-forward swimming and upside-down swimming, respectively. The average animal size was about 4 cm\nMetachronal rowing seems to be efficient propulsive aid for Antarctic krill to travel long distances. Study done by Alben et al. show that metachronal rhythm produce larger average propulsion velocity compared to more synchronous stroke rhythms. It has also been shown that krill produce lift to balance the force acting on them as a result of negative buoyancy, allowing them to swim forward while maintaining their position in the water column \nBio-inspired robotics.\nMetachronal swimmers have inspired solutions for underwater locomotion in the intermediate Reynolds number regime due to their high maneuverability. Model organisms used to inspired designs include krill, ctenophores (comb jelly), and copepods. Bio-inspired robots can be used to find design solutions for underwater locomotion, as well as give greater insight into their model organism. Robotic models allow for parameter variations that live organisms don't, which gives us the opportunity to explore solutions outside of nature imposed boundaries. A shrimp-inspired metachronal robot can be used to study and understand the flexural asymmetry of shrimp pleopods, and their influence on efficiency and propulsion."

She served as secretary of the British Ice Hockey Association from 1972 to 1987, and was previously secretary to Bunny Ahearne beginning in 1953. She also worked in the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) office for more than 20 years, represented Great Britain at IIHF congresses. She \nwas inducted into the British Ice Hockey Hall of Fame for her work in Great Britain, and received the Paul Loicq Award for her work in international ice hockey.\nCareer.\nMarsh first attended an ice hockey game in 1950. She began working for Bunny Ahearne as his secretary at the British Ice Hockey Association (BIHA) in 1953. Ahearne's hiring of Marsh coincided with his term as secretary of the BIHA, and his alternating roles as president and vice-president of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). Ahearne became president of the BIHA in 1971, and Marsh took his place as the BIHA secretary in 1972.\nMarsh occasionally travelled with BIHA junior teams, and was in Barcelona when the Great Britain men's national under-18 ice hockey team won a gold medal in 1986. Marsh also worked in the IIHF office for more than 20 years. She represented the BIHA and Great Britain at annual IIHF congresses.\nLater life.\nMarsh retired from her position as secretary of the BIHA in 1987, after 24 years of service, and was succeeded by David Pickles. At the time she was remembered as being \"well-liked but now overworked\". After retiring, she continued as a special consultant for the BIHA until 1999. Marsh was inducted into British Ice Hockey Hall of Fame for her contributions to ice hockey in Great Britain. She also received the Paul Loicq Award in 2002, for her work in international ice hockey.\nMarsh died on 3 May 2017 at the age of 83, which would indicate she was born in either 1933 or 1934. Past BIHA president Freddie Meredith remarked that Marsh devoted a lifetime to the sport of ice hockey, and that its growth in Great Britain during the 1980s and the 1990s would have been impossible without Marsh's efforts, saying that \"she was truly the first lady of British Ice Hockey\". The funeral for Marsh was scheduled for 12 May 2017, in Kent."

It was Ireland's first Test played overseas and the first Test match between the two sides. All of the fixtures took place at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in Dehradun. The ODI fixtures were part of Afghanistan's preparation for the 2019 Cricket World Cup.

They made the highest team total, with 278 for 3, which included the highest partnership for any wicket, with Hazratullah Zazai and Usman Ghani putting on 236 runs for the first wicket. Hazratullah Zazai scored 162 not out, the highest score for an Afghan batsman in a T20I fixture. Afghanistan went on to win the T20I series 3–0. The ODI series was drawn 2–2, after the second match finished as a no result.\nAfghanistan won the one-off Test match by seven wickets to record their first victory in a Test match. They became the joint-second quickest, after England and Pakistan, to record their maiden win in Test cricket. Asghar Afghan, captain of the Afghanistan team said that \"it is a historic day for Afghanistan, for Afghanistan people, for our team, for our cricket board\". Ireland's captain, William Porterfield, said he was pleased how the five debutants performed and that Afghanistan were deserved winners. Afghanistan's all-rounder Mohammad Nabi, praised both the batting and the bowling from the team saying \"it shows we are ready for Test cricket\". Player of the match, Rahmat Shah, moved up to 89th place in the ICC Test Player Rankings, the highest-placed batsman for Afghanistan.\nSquads.\nAhead of the ODI series, Stuart Thompson was added to Ireland's squad. Following the conclusion of the ODI series, Zahir Khan and Sayed Shirzad were both added to Afghanistan's Test squad."

When he was 7 years old, his family moved again, this time to San Diego in California. He played college basketball for Santa Ana College before transferring to Cal State LA in 1975. In 1977 he made the CCAA All-First team.\nPlaying career.\nProfessional career.\nAfter graduating, Stewart had a tryout with the Portland Trail Blazers. After failing to get a contract with the Blazers, he signed with USC Freiburg in West Germany.\nIn August 1978, he signed with ÍR of the Icelandic Úrvalsdeild karla as a player-coach. In his first game for ÍR, Stewart scored 46 points in a 100-88 victory against ÍS in the pre-season Reykjavík Basketball Tournament. He finished as the third highest scorer in the tournament with 166 points in 5 games. On 13 October, Stewart got into an altercation with Njarðvík's Stefán Bjarkason in a game played at the Naval Air Station Keflavik which ended with both Military Police and Icelandic Police being called to the scene. After the fight, Stefán was transported to the base hospital where he received 6 stitches to his face. Although the game was part of an unofficial tournament, the Icelandic Basketball Federation disciplinary court suspended Stewart for three weeks which meant that he would miss two games in the Úrvalsdeild, including a game against Njarðvík. The verdict was highly controversial as it was only based on police statements from Stefán and Narðvík's assistant coach, Ingi Gunnarsson. Without Stewart, ÍR defeated Njarðvík, 95-89, with Stefán being booed loudly by the ÍR fans whenever he touched the ball. As \nÍR's game against KR was postponed until December, allowing Stewart to play in it as his suspension was up.\nAlthough he was hampered by a knee injury for much of the season, Stewart averaged 26.8 points per game, good for fourth best in the league. In the Icelandic Cup, ÍR advanced to the finals after beating Njarðvík, 96-95, in the semi-finals behind Stewart's and Jón Jörundsson's play. In the finals, ÍR met KR in the Laugardalshöll. The game, which had heavy police presence due to violence by supporters in the stands at recent games, ended with a convincing 87-72 KR victory despite Stewart's 26 points.\nThe following seasons he played for Team Fiat and Ovaltine in England.\nNational team career.\nIn 1979, Stewart was selected to the Scottish national basketball team. On 30 April 1982, Stewart had 26 points and 18 rebounds in a 77-64 victory against Iceland in the EuroBasket 1983 qualification.\nCoaching career.\nStewart served as a player-coach for ÍR during the 1978-1979 season.

Norway won; Germany unsuccessfully defended its title.\nCompetition format.\nThe relay teams consist of four biathletes. Every athlete's leg is skied over three laps for a total of , with two shooting rounds: one prone and one standing. For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually from the spare round holders or from bullets deposited by the athlete into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still standing targets, one penalty loop must be taken for each remaining target. The first-leg participants start all at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of their position in the race), then for the remainder of the relay, the athletes shoot at the lane corresponding to the position they arrived (arrive at the range in 5th place, shoot at lane five)."

The club is only open to members and their guests.\nThe club was developed by the American entrepreneur Frederick D. Green. The American businessman Walter Forbes was also involved in the creation of the club. Green had previously developed the Eagle Springs and Nantucket golf clubs in the United States. It was designed by David McLay Kidd and opened in 2001. On his website McLay Kidd stated that he aimed for Queenwood to be a departure from that \"modern style\" that had led to recent expensive club closures and a \"return to the heathland traditions\" of the courses at the famed nearby clubs of Sunningdale Golf Club, Walton Heath Golf Club, Woking Golf Club, and Swinley Forest Golf Club. McLay Kidd employed the extensive use of heather as a design element \"both for its strategic and aesthetic values, most notably on the bunker faces. It took a good five years to grow in to the fullest, and now that it has, everyone seems to understand why I insisted on using the heather so extensively\".\nA 2017 article in \"GQ Magazine\" stated that the joining fee for Queenwood was believed to be £150,000 upon its 2005 opening, but is now estimated to be in excess of £200,000 and confirmed by member Mr James Wynne. \"Golf Monthly\" magazine listed the club as one of the '10 Most Exclusive Golf Clubs In the UK', writing that \"When it comes to exclusive golf clubs, Queenwood is one of the world's leaders. Little is known about the super-private Surrey club which has a phenomenal golf course always kept in pristine condition\".\nMembership.\nA 2005 article in \"The Guardian\" stated that the membership of Queenwood was limited to 350 and included the actors Michael Douglas, Hugh Grant, and Catherine Zeta-Jones among its members as well as professional golfers Darren Clarke and Ernie Els. Els wrote of the Queenwood course that \"The practice facilities are so good they wouldn't be out of place at a professional tour event and generally there are not many people around so I can concentrate fully on my game.\"\nThe American diplomat James Rubin and the British strategist and diarist Alastair Campbell played several times at the club in 2006 and 2007. Campbell described the club in his diaries as \"Height of luxury ... Caddies, club cleaners, shoe polishers really OTT and luxurious, lots of banker wanker types\". The Queenwood's no-mobile-phone policy was waived as Campbell took calls on the golf course from Prime Minister Tony Blair. Campbell also played at Queenwood with the footballer Jamie Redknapp and the solicitor David Mills and met Gary Lineker there."

The Test series was played for the Trans-Tasman Trophy and formed part of the inaugural 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship. The first Test was a day/night match at the Perth Stadium. Cricket Australia confirmed the fixtures for the tour in May 2019. New Zealand returned to Australia in March 2020 to play three One Day International (ODI) matches for the Chappell–Hadlee Trophy.\nIn the first Test, Aleem Dar of Pakistan stood in his 129th Test match as an on-field umpire, surpassing Jamaican Steve Bucknor's record of officiating in the most Test matches. Ahead of the fourth day of the second Test match, Australia's Peter Siddle announced his retirement from international cricket. Australia won the first two Test matches to take an unassailable lead, and therefore retaining the Trans-Tasman Trophy. Australia won the third and final Test match by 279 runs, therefore winning the series 3–0. It was the first time that New Zealand had been whitewashed in a three-match Test series in Australia. During the third Test, Ross Taylor went past Stephen Fleming's career total of 7,172 runs to become the leading run-scorer for New Zealand in Test cricket.\nAhead of the first ODI, Cricket Australia confirmed that all three ODIs would be played without crowd attendance, in an attempt to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the first ODI being played, the second and third ODIs were called off on 14 March 2020, as a result of new travel restrictions being implemented in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Both Cricket Australia and New Zealand Cricket have expressed their interest to reschedule the remaining ODI matches at a later date. On 28 May 2020, Cricket Australia confirmed the fixtures for a rescheduled three match ODI series against New Zealand in January and February 2021.\nSquads.\nPeter Siddle was added to Australia's squad ahead of the second Test after Josh Hazlewood was ruled out due to a hamstring strain.

        "title": "Sri Lankan cricket team in Pakistan in 2019–20",
        "text": "The Sri Lankan cricket team toured Pakistan in September and October 2019 to play three One Day Internationals (ODIs) and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches against the Pakistan cricket team. The tour originally had two Test matches scheduled to take place, but these were moved to December 2019. Sri Lanka last played a match in Pakistan in October 2017, when the third T20I took place at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. Pakistan won the ODI series 2–0, after the first match was washed out, and Sri Lanka won the T20I series 3–0.\nSeveral players in Sri Lanka's squad opted not to travel for the series, with Lahiru Thirimanne and Dasun Shanaka named as ODI and T20I captains respectively. Despite Pakistan failing to reach the semi-finals of the 2019 Cricket World Cup in England, Sarfaraz Ahmed was retained as the captain of the team for the tour, with Babar Azam named as vice-captain. Sarfaraz later said that leading the Pakistan team at home \"will be one of the highlights of my career\".\nFollowing the limited overs matches, Sri Lanka returned to Pakistan in December 2019 to play two Test matches. The Test series formed part of the inaugural 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship. It was the first time in ten years that Test cricket was played in Pakistan.\nThe first Test match finished as a draw, with significant amounts of play lost to rain and bad light. Pakistan's Abid Ali scored 109 not out to become the first male cricketer to score a century on debut in a Test and ODI match. Following the first Test, Sri Lanka's captain Dimuth Karunaratne expressed his regret in not playing in the limited-overs matches, and said that \"Pakistan is now safe for cricket\". Pakistan won the second Test match by 263 runs, to give them a 1–0 series win, and their first Test victory in Pakistan in ten years. Following the win, Pakistan's Test captain Azhar Ali said that \"it carried great importance and was very significant because we were playing our first home Test series\".\nBackground.\nIn March 2009, the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked by gunmen ahead of the second Test match at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, and had not played a full series in Pakistan since. In May 2019, at the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) meeting in Singapore, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) made a request to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) to play two Test matches in Pakistan. In July 2019, the SLC sent a security expert to assess the situation in Pakistan, with Sri Lanka Cricket saying they were \"likely\" to play a Test match in the country. A further decision was taken by Sri Lanka after a security delegation inspects venues in Lahore and Karachi in early August 2019. The delegation gave Sri Lanka Cricket \"very positive feedback\", suggesting that Sri Lanka could be open to playing a Test match in Pakistan. On 22 August 2019, Sri Lanka's Sports Minister confirmed their agreement to play a three-match ODI series in Pakistan in October, but ruled out playing any Test matches.\nOn 9 September 2019, Sri Lanka Cricket met with players who were selected in a preliminary squad for the tour, to confirm with each individual if they would travel or not to Pakistan. Dinesh Chandimal, Akila Dananjaya, Niroshan Dickwella, Dimuth Karunaratne, Suranga Lakmal, Lasith Malinga, Angelo Mathews, Kusal Perera, Thisara Perera and Dhananjaya de Silva all confirmed that they would not be going to Pakistan for the tour. Two days later, on the day that Sri Lanka named the squads to tour Pakistan, Sri Lanka's government received information on a possible terrorist threat on the team. Sri Lanka Cricket conducted a reassessment prior to the tour starting. The PCB ruled out moving the fixtures to a neutral venue. Ehsan Mani, chairman of the PCB, stated that \"we don't have the time to shift or lookout for any other option right now\", reiterating that the PCB's default position of playing the matches in Pakistan. On 19 September 2019, Sri Lanka Cricket confirmed that the tour would go ahead as planned. Two days later, the PCB appointed all the match officials for the tour.\nIn October 2019, the PCB proposed hosting the two Test matches in Pakistan, instead of the UAE, at venues in Rawalpindi and Karachi. Sri Lanka Cricket said that they were \"very positive\" with regards to the progress of playing Test cricket in Pakistan. In November 2019, the PCB confirmed the dates and venues for the Test series. As a result of the Test series being agreed, the PCB moved the dates of the final of the 2019–20 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy to accommodate the international fixtures. In November 2019, Sri Lanka named a full-strength squad for the Test matches, with only one change from their previous Test series, which was against New Zealand in August 2019. Early the following month, the International Cricket Council (ICC) appointed the match officials for the Test series. Pakistan confirmed their Test squad four days ahead of the first match. Fawad Alam was recalled to Pakistan's squad, after last playing a Test for the team in November and December 2009, against New Zealand. The Sri Lankan Test squad arrived in Pakistan on 9 December 2019. No cricketer from either team had previously played Test cricket in Pakistan.\nSummary.\nLimited-overs matches.\nThe first ODI match at the National Stadium in Karachi was abandoned due to rain. It was the first time that an ODI match at the venue had been washed out. As a result, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) rescheduled the second ODI match, moving it back one day to 30 September 2019, to allow the groundstaff more time to prepare the outfield. Pakistan won both of the remaining matches to win the ODI series 2–0.\nIn the T20I series, Sri Lanka won the first match by 64 runs, their first win against Pakistan . Sri Lanka also won the second T20I, by a margin of 35 runs, to take an unassailable lead in the series. It was Sri Lanka's first ever series win against Pakistan in a T20I bilateral series. Sri Lanka went on to win the final T20I match by 13 runs, winning the series 3–0. It was the first time in a three-match T20I series that Sri Lanka had won 3–0, and the first time that Pakistan had been whitewashed.\nAfterwards, Pakistan's head coach and chief selector Misbah-ul-Haq and team captain Sarfaraz Ahmed admitted that losing a series 3–0 to a second-string side had left them with \"lots of questions to answer\". Meanwhile, Sri Lanka's coach, Rumesh Ratnayake, praised the hospitality and security that the team had received in Pakistan, saying that it is \"a message for the whole world\", with the hopes other teams would tour Pakistan again.\nTest matches.\nIn the first Test match, Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat. However, most of the match was affected by the weather, with rain and bad light impacting on the Test. Only 18.2 overs were bowled on day two, 5.2 overs on day three, and no play at all was possible on day four. Early on the fifth and final day, Sri Lanka declared their first innings, after Dhananjaya de Silva had scored his century. Pakistan's Abid Ali and Babar Azam both scored unbeaten hundreds, before the teams shook hands, with the match finishing as a draw. Abid Ali became the first male cricketer to score a century on his Test and ODI debuts.\nPakistan won the toss and elected to bat in the second Test. However, they were bowled out for 191 runs inside of 60 overs. Sri Lanka then lost three wickets, ending the first day on 64/3. Sri Lanka were dismissed for 271 runs on day two, with a lead of 80 runs over the hosts. In reply, Shan Masood and Abid Ali made an opening stand of 278 runs, the second-highest partnership for the first wicket for Pakistan in a Test match. Shan Masood, Abid Ali, Azhar Ali and Babar Azam all made centuries, with Pakistan becoming only the second team in Test cricket history to have their top four batsmen to score hundreds. Pakistan eventually declared their innings on 555/3 at lunch on day four. Sri Lanka reached the end of day four with 212 runs, but for the loss of seven wickets. Pakistan only needed 16 balls on the morning of day five to dismiss Sri Lanka, with Naseem Shah taking his first five-wicket haul in Test cricket. Pakistan won the match by 263 runs, taking the two-match series 1–0. Abid Ali was named the player of the match and the player of the series.\nIt was Pakistan's first series win in Pakistan since beating the West Indies 2–0 in November 2006. It was also Pakistan's first series win in Pakistan against Sri Lanka since their 1–0 win in January 1992.\nSquads.\nAhead of the Test series, Suranga Lakmal was ruled out of Sri Lanka's squad with dengue fever, with Asitha Fernando named as his replacement."

        "text": "The Bangladesh cricket team toured Pakistan in January and February 2020 to play one Test match and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches against the Pakistan cricket team. The Test series formed part of the inaugural 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship.\nAfter lengthy discussions by both cricket boards, with the threat of Bangladesh not touring Pakistan, the tour schedule was finally agreed on 14 January 2020. The tour itinerary was split into three legs, with the T20Is taking place in January in Lahore, followed by the first Test in early February in Rawalpindi. Pakistan won the T20I series 2–0, with the third match abandoned due to rain. Pakistan won the first Test by an innings, to take a 1–0 lead in the series.\nBangladesh were then scheduled to return to Pakistan in April after the conclusion of 2020 Pakistan Super League, to play a one-off One Day International (ODI) match and a second Test match, with both fixtures to be played in Karachi. Originally, the ODI match was not included in the International Cricket Council's (ICC) Future Tours Programme. However, on 16 March 2020, the third leg of the tour was called off due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both cricket boards were looking at a window in the future schedule to play the remaining matches. In July 2020, the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed it was their priority to reschedule the match, along with the five other World Test Championship series that had been postponed due to the pandemic. In September 2020, the PCB initially announced that they were planning to host the postponed Test match in October 2020. However, the PCB issued a further statement saying it would be postponed until the 2021–22 season, due to a busy fixture schedule.\nBackground.\nIn November 2019, after Pakistan gained agreement to host a home Test series against Sri Lanka, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) requested that this series was also played in Pakistan. However, some Bangladeshi players expressed their concern of visiting Pakistan for three weeks. In December 2019, the PCB proposed playing one of the Test matches as a day/night fixture in Karachi. In response, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) suggested that they would only play the T20I series in Pakistan, with the Test matches played at a neutral venue. The BCB were awaiting on security assessments from their government before the tour itinerary was confirmed.\nEhsan Mani, Chairman of the PCB, stated that Pakistan did not want to play any future home matches at neutral venues. On 14 December 2019, Nazmul Hassan, President of the BCB, said that he was hopeful that the team would get the necessary security clearance to tour Pakistan. However, on 18 December Wasim Khan, the CEO of the PCB said that Bangladesh were still reluctant to play the Test matches in Pakistan, wishing only play the T20Is in the country. Azhar Ali, captain of Pakistan's Test side said \"there is no excuse not to come\", with team coach Misbah-ul-Haq calling it \"a great injustice\" with regards to the delay from the BCB. Following the success of the home Tests against Sri Lanka, Ehsan Mani maintained the PCB's position of playing future matches in Pakistan saying \"all of Pakistan's matches, against Bangladesh or anyone else, will take place in Pakistan\". The BCB reiterated their position saying that they will only play the T20Is in Pakistan, and would make a decision on the Test matches after that. Russell Domingo, head coach of the Bangladesh team, said that he was willing to travel to Pakistan, if the BCB agreed to touring the country. Despite the perceived concerns of playing in Pakistan, twenty three Bangladesh cricketers had registered for the draft for the 2020 Pakistan Super League.\nOn 7 January 2020, the BCB began to take consent from their players to travel to Pakistan, with a final decision from Bangladesh expected on 12 January following their board meeting. The following day, the PCB revised its offer, proposing that only the two Test matches would be played in January and February. The PCB also proposed playing the T20I matches at a later date, closer to the 2020 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. Following their board meeting, the BCB confirmed that their government had agreed to a tour of Pakistan. However, they stated that it should be a short tour with T20I matches only, citing the tensions in the Middle East. Nazmul Hassan announced that he would travel to Dubai on 13 January 2020 to meet with Shashank Manohar, the chairman of the ICC, to discuss the implications of not playing the Test matches. Ehsan Mani also met with Nazmul Hassan following the ICC meeting to discuss the situation. The following day, both cricket boards agreed to a three-leg tour of Pakistan, starting with a three-match T20I series. However, Mushfiqur Rahim, Bangladesh's T20I wicket-keeper, said that he would not be travelling to Pakistan for the T20I matches. The BCB also confirmed that five members of their coaching staff would also not be travelling for the T20I series. The BCB named their squad for the T20I leg on 18 January 2020, with the PCB confirming the match officials for the fixtures three days later.\nOn 9 February 2020, the PCB proposed the idea of playing the second Test match as a day/night fixture. The PCB's CEO, Wasim Khan, said that \"with Test cricket returning to Pakistan now and many countries also going towards day and night Tests, we want to give our players maximum exposure\". However, two days later the BCB declined the offer to play a day/night Test match. The BCB's chief executive officer, Nizamuddin Chowdhury, said that the team was not yet ready to play a day/night Test due to lack of preparation.\nFirst leg.\nT20I series summary.\nThe Bangladesh team arrived in Pakistan on 22 January 2020, to play the three T20I matches, having last toured the country in April 2008. The first match took place on 24 January 2020, with Babar Azam captaining Pakistan for the first time at home. Ahsan Ali and Haris Rauf both made their T20I debuts for Pakistan, with the home team winning the match by five wickets. This ended a six-match losing streak for the team in the format. The second T20I, played the following day, saw Pakistan win by nine wickets, after an unbeaten 131-run partnership from Babar Azam and Mohammad Hafeez. This gave Pakistan an unassailable lead in the three-match series, and their first T20I series win since beating New Zealand 3–0 in November 2018. The third and final match of the series was abandoned without a ball being bowled, due to rain, therefore giving Pakistan a 2–0 series win. Despite losing a home series to Sri Lanka in October 2019, and an away series to Australia in November 2019, Pakistan retained their number one ranking in the ICC T20I Championship with their 2–0 win.\nBabar Azam praised the Pakistan bowlers saying that \"our bowling was outstanding in both the games and helped us keep them down to low totals\". Bangladesh's captain, Mahmudullah, was disappointed with the loss, but also praised Pakistan's bowling saying \"in the second match they won convincingly because they have a good bowling side\". The Bangladesh team flew out from Pakistan later the same day, and returned to the country on 5 February 2020 for the first Test match.\nSecond leg.\n1st Test summary.\nOn 1 February 2020, Pakistan named their squad for the Test match in Rawalpindi. Bilal Asif and Faheem Ashraf were recalled to the team, with Kashif Bhatti and Usman Shinwari being left out. Later the same day, Bangladesh also confirmed their squad for the first Test. Mustafizur Rahman was omitted from Bangladesh's squad due to poor performance, with Tamim Iqbal being recalled, after missing the series against India following the birth of his child. A day after the squads were named, Tamim Iqbal scored a triple century in the 2019–20 Bangladesh Cricket League, finishing with 334 not out, the highest score in first-class cricket by a Bangladeshi batsman. The Bangladesh team arrived in Rawalpindi on 5 February 2020. Bangladesh last played a Test match in Pakistan in September 2003. The same day, the ICC appointed the match officials for the first Test, with Nigel Llong and Chris Gaffaney named as the on-field umpires.\nPakistan won the toss and elected to field. Saif Hassan made his Test match debut for Bangladesh, but was dismissed for a duck. Bangladesh were dismissed for 233 runs late on day one, with Mohammad Mithun top-scoring with 66 runs and Pakistan's Shaheen Afridi taking four wickets. In reply, Shan Masood and Babar Azam each scored centuries for the hosts. Pakistan finished day two with a lead of 109 runs, before bad light ended play early. Pakistan were bowled out just after lunch on day three for 445 runs, giving them a lead of 212. At the age of 16 years and 359 days, Pakistan's Naseem Shah became the youngest bowler to take a hat-trick in Test cricket. He dismissed Najmul Hossain Shanto, Taijul Islam and Mahmudullah in successive deliveries in the 41st over of Bangladesh's second innings. Bangladesh ended day three on 126 for the loss of six wickets, 86 runs behind Pakistan's first innings total. Bangladesh were bowled out before lunch on the fourth day, losing the match by an innings and 44 runs, with Yasir Shah and Naseem Shah taking four wickets each. Naseem Shah was named as the player of the match, with five wickets in the game, including a hat-trick.\nPost-match, Pakistan's captain Azhar Ali praised his fast bowlers saying that \"the current Pakistani Test team should be led by its fast bowlers\". He also praised wicket-keeper's Mohammad Rizwan use of the review system, saying that they were proud of our reviews, after not being too good with them in the past. He also gave credit to the home pitches, and their higher scoring rate compare to playing in the UAE, saying that \"the more runs you have under your belt, the higher your confidence is\". In contrast, Bangladesh's captain Mominul Haque reflected on the team's poor batting, especially the low total made in the first innings on a flat wicket. He went on to say that the team should take inspiration from the Bangladesh under-19 team, who won the 2020 Under-19 Cricket World Cup the previous day. He said that the U19 team had \"really fought back on the ground and we should learn from them\".\nThird leg.\nThird leg summary.\nAhead of the tour, Bangladesh's Mushfiqur Rahim said that he would not travel to Pakistan, stating that his family was worried about him going. However, the BCB's president, Nazmul Hassan, expected him to travel and criticised his choice of not travelling. Hassan said that he was contract-bound to travel for the last leg of the tour in Karachi, but added \"we won't force anyone, but after speaking to all, I think he should go\". At the end of February 2020, Mushfiqur reiterated his stance, saying he has been clear about not travelling, and that he will not be going to Pakistan. In March 2020, Mushfiqur was rested ahead of Bangladesh's third and final ODI match against Zimbabwe. Mashrafe Mortaza captained Bangladesh in the ODIs against Zimbabwe, before he stepped down from the position. The BCB appointed Tamim Iqbal as the new ODI captain ahead of the one-off match against Pakistan.\nIn February 2020, Bangladesh beat Zimbabwe by an innings and 106 runs in their one-off Test match. Bangladesh's captain Mominul Haque said that the win gives them confidence and will help the team in the Test match against Pakistan. On 4 March 2020, the PCB rescheduled the date of the one-off ODI match, bringing it forward from 3 April to 1 April 2020, to allow the Bangladesh team more practice time for the second Test."

        "text": "The England cricket team toured South Africa from December 2019 to February 2020 to play four Tests, three One Day Internationals (ODIs) and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. The Test series formed part of the inaugural 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship. Cricket South Africa confirmed the fixtures for the tour in May 2019.\nIn September 2019, Cricket South Africa raised concerns about hosting the New Year's Test match at the Newlands Cricket Ground, with regards to financial issues around Western Province Cricket Association's affairs. The following month, Cricket South Africa confirmed that the venue would host the Test match as planned. Ahead of the Test series, South Africa's Vernon Philander announced that the series would be his last before retiring from international cricket. In the first Test, England's James Anderson became the ninth cricketer to play in 150 Test matches. The third Test of the series was England's 500th to be played overseas. England won the Test series 3–1, the first time that the England cricket team had won three Tests on a tour to South Africa since 1913–14. South Africa became the first team to be deducted World Test Championship points, after a slow over-rate in the fourth Test.\nFor the One Day International series, Cricket South Africa appointed Quinton de Kock as the new captain of their ODI team, replacing Faf du Plessis. Du Plessis was also dropped from the ODI squad. Quinton de Kock was also named as South Africa's captain for the T20I series. The ODI series was drawn 1–1, after the second match was washed out. England won the T20I series 2–1. The 1,207 runs scored in the T20Is broke the record for the most runs scored in a three-match T20I series. The day after the final T20I match, Faf du Plessis announced that he had stepped down as the captain of South Africa's Test and T20I sides.\nSquads.\nAhead of the first Test match, several members of the England cricket team became ill with flu-like symptoms. As a result, Dom Bess and Craig Overton were called up to England's squad as cover. During the first Test, South Africa's Aiden Markram fractured his finger ruling him out of the rest of the series. Keegan Petersen was named as Markram's replacement in South Africa's Test squad. Prior to the second Test, Rory Burns suffered an ankle injury playing football and was ruled out of England's squad for the rest of the series. In January 2020, Pat Brown was ruled out of England's ODI and T20I squads, following a stress fracture to his lower back. England's James Anderson suffered a rib injury on the final day of the second Test, and was ruled out of the rest of the series. Craig Overton remained in England's Test squad as cover for Anderson. Before the third Test, England's Jack Leach flew home after suffering from sepsis. South Africa's Kagiso Rabada was banned from the fourth Test, after breaching the ICC code of conduct for his celebration after dismissing Joe Root in the third Test. England's Jofra Archer picked up an elbow injury during the Test series that eventually ruled him out of playing in the T20I matches. Saqib Mahmood was named as Archer's replacement in England's T20I squad. Ahead of the ODI series, Sisanda Magala was declared not to be fully fit, and was ruled out of South Africa's squad."

The Test series formed part of the inaugural 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship. New Zealand Cricket confirmed the fixtures for the tour in June 2019.\nIndia won the first three T20I matches to give them an unassailable lead in the series. The third T20I was decided by a Super Over, after both teams made 179 runs from their twenty overs. This gave India their first T20I series win in New Zealand. Kane Williamson was ruled out of the fourth T20I with a shoulder injury, with Tim Southee named as New Zealand's captain in Williamson's absence. The fourth T20I was also tied, with India once again winning the match in the Super Over. India won the final T20I match to take the series 5–0, becoming the first side to whitewash another team in a five-match bilateral T20 series. Williamson's injury also ruled him out of the first two ODIs, with Tom Latham captaining the side.\nNew Zealand won the first two ODIs, therefore giving them an unassailable lead in the series. New Zealand won the third match by five wickets, to give them a 3–0 series win, and their first clean sweep against India in an ODI series with three or more matches. It was the first time that India was whitewashed in an ODI series since losing 5–0 to the West Indies in March 1989.\nDuring the tour, New Zealand's Ross Taylor became the first cricketer to play in 100 matches in all three formats of international cricket. New Zealand won the first Test by ten wickets to record their 100th victory in Test match cricket. New Zealand won the second Test by seven wickets, taking the series 2–0, and extending their record of being undefeated at home to thirteen Test matches. It was the first time that India had been whitewashed in a Test series under Virat Kohli's captaincy.\nSquads.\nAhead of the tour Shikhar Dhawan was ruled out of India's squad, after he suffered a shoulder injury during the third ODI against Australia. Prithvi Shaw and Sanju Samson replaced Dhawan in India's ODI and T20I squads respectively. India's Rohit Sharma was ruled out of the rest of the series, after suffering a calf injury during the fifth and final T20I match. Mayank Agarwal was named as Sharma's replacement in India's ODI squad. New Zealand's Kane Williamson suffered an injury during the T20I series and was ruled out of the first two ODI matches, with Mark Chapman added to their squad.

Games in which the team announced it would compete include \"Call of Duty\", ', \"Fortnite\", \"League of Legends\", \"Overwatch\" and '.\nIn 2020, U.S. military esports activities garnered widespread media attention after a successful legal battle led by the ACLU forced them to lift the bans on the people they had removed for discussing war crimes committed by U.S. armed forces.\nHistory.\nThe U.S. Army Esports team was founded in November 2018. After the Army missed its recruiting goal for the first time in 13 years, the team was founded in an effort to modernize outreach efforts.\nIn 2022, the team finished second in the inaugural Armed Forces Sports Championship in \"Halo Infinite\" that was played against the other U.S. service branches.\nFirst Amendment concerns.\nThe official U.S. Army Esports Discord server and Twitch became the target of activists who began to post comments and memes referencing war crimes committed by the United States. This led to moderators of the Discord server temporarily restricting people from joining, and a number of Twitch users being banned from the U.S. Army Esports Twitch channel.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and other organizations have claimed that the banning of Twitch users from the channel is a violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. An official spokesperson for the U.S. Army noted that users were subsequently banned after trolling and harassing members of the team; however, some bans were lifted.\nFake giveaway accusations.\nThe team has been accused of promoting fake giveaways on Twitch by providing links that they claimed would enter viewers into a giveaway for an Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, but rather redirected viewers to a recruitment form. Twitch asked the channel to remove those links, with which the Esports channel complied. The team noted that they had given away ten controllers, gaming stations, and chairs in the past year.\nReturn to Twitch.\nIn response to the mass criticism, the U.S. Army Esports team announced on 22 July 2020 that they would halt activity on Twitch and would likely resume activity in spring 2021. However, the team returned to Twitch on 14 August 2020.\nOn 22 July 2020, U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez filed a draft amendment to the House Appropriations Bill that would prohibit the U.S. military from \"[maintaining] a presence on Twitch or any video game, e-sports, or live-streaming platform.\" This amendment has since been defeated however, with the final vote being 292–126 against it and 13 members abstaining from voting."

        "text": "William Edward Norman Davis better known as Wendy Davis (7 September 1913 – c. 2002) was an international rugby union prop who represented Wales on three occasions and played club rugby for Cardiff. His international rugby career was curtailed by the outbreak of the Second World War but he continued to play as part of the British Army team. \nPersonal history.\nDavis was born in Birmingham, England, in 1913. He was educated at Camp Hill School for Boys in Birmingham, and then at Cardiff High School. He ran a tannery. With the outbreak of the Second World War Davis joined the British Army. The Who's Who of Welsh International Rugby Players states that Davis served in the Royal Artillery, but \"The London Gazette\" in 1940 lists him in the Royal Welch Fusiliers. In retirement Davis moved to Cirencester where he died circa 2002.\nRugby career.\nDavis played rugby for both Camp Hill and Cardiff High while a youth. He joined Cardiff RFC during the 1934–35 season and remained at the club until the outbreak of war. He played 119 matches for Cardiff receiving his First XV cap during the 1934–35 season when he represented the club 15 times. In the 1938–39 season, he was Cardiff's vice captain, under Wilf Wooler. As well as Cardiff, Davis also played for local rivals Penarth RFC and Cardiff High School Old Boys.\nIn 1939 Davis was selected to play for his first international match for Wales. His inaugural game was against England in the 1939 Home Nations Championship. Although Wales lost the opening game, Davis was on the winning side for both of the tournament's remaining matches against Scotland and Ireland. Although the outbreak of the Second World War brought a close to international rugby, Davis continued to play, most often in charity war matches. In 1940 was chosen to represent the British Army, playing against France, and scored a rare try in a heavy 36–3 victory over the French. As well as the Army team, Davis also played for touring invitational team the Barbarians. His first match for the Barbarians was before the war, playing against the East Midlands county team. He would play a further four matches for the team, all wartime charity matches between 1941 and 1943, against Thorneloe's XV (named after Leicester secretary J.E. Thorneloe who organised the games). After retiring from playing rugby Davis worked as a summariser for the Welsh Home Service during the 1950s.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "title": "1978–79 Penn Quakers men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1978–79 Penn Quakers men's basketball team was a college basketball team that represented the University of Pennsylvania in the 1978–79 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Quakers, coached by Bob Weinhauer, played in the Ivy League and had a 25–7 win–loss record. Penn won the Ivy League regular season championship for the eighth time in 10 years and participated in the 1979 NCAA Division I basketball tournament. There, as the ninth seed in the 10-team East region, the Quakers defeated Iona, number one seed North Carolina, Syracuse, and St. John's to reach the Final Four. In the national semifinals, they lost to a Michigan State team that included Magic Johnson, and an overtime loss in the third-place game against DePaul ended their season. As of 2024, the 1978–79 Quakers are the last Ivy League team to play in the Final Four.\nBackground.\nDuring the previous decade, Penn had been highly ranked at times. In 1969–70, the Quakers lost only once in 26 regular season games and reached the top 10 in multiple national polls before a first-round loss in the NCAA tournament. The following season, the Quakers did not lose during the regular season and achieved a year-end ranking of number three, but were routed by Villanova in the regional finals of the NCAA tournament; in 1971–72 they ended the regular season second in the Associated Press (AP) Poll, and again lost in the regional finals. Penn won at least 17 games in each of the next four seasons, but was only able to advance out of the first round of the NCAA Tournament once, in 1973. Before the 1977–78 season, Bob Weinhauer became the Quakers' head coach, taking the job previously held by Chuck Daly. The Quakers qualified for the NCAA tournament and won one game before being eliminated by Duke, 84–80.\nRoster.\nPenn had four returning starters who were in their senior year at the school. Among them was 6'6\" Tony Price, who became a leader for the team. The other senior starters were Tim Smith, Matthew White, and Bobby Willis. Price, a forward, topped the Quakers with averages of 19.8 points and 8.7 rebounds per game, and added 3.3 assists per game. Forward Smith had 13.4 points and 6.4 rebounds per game, and White, a center, averaged 11.7 points and 7.5 rebounds. Willis, a guard, contributed 9.1 points per game and led Penn with 4.2 assists per game. Other players for the Quakers included guard James Salters, who averaged 9.3 points per game, fellow guards Ken Hall and Angelo Reynolds, and forward Vincent Ross.\nRegular season.\nThe Quakers' non-conference schedule was described by writer Neal Geoghegan as \"quite challenging\". It included two games against Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) opposition, and an invitation to the Cabrillo Classic tournament in San Diego, where the Quakers were matched with Big Ten Conference team Iowa. In addition, Penn participated in the annual Big 5 series against other Philadelphia colleges, having finished in at least a share of first place in the competition six times in the previous nine years.\nPenn opened the season at their home arena, The Palestra, against the ACC's Virginia on November 29, 1978, winning by an 80–78 margin. Two days later, the Quakers traveled to Navy for their second game and posted an 82–66 victory. Another road game at Tulane followed, which the Quakers won by 17 points to move to 3–0. Following that game, Penn hosted La Salle, in their first Big 5 game of the season. In a close encounter, Price made a jump shot in the closing seconds to give the Quakers a 68–67 win. The Quakers then traveled to San Diego for their matchup with Iowa. The teams played into double overtime, where the Hawkeyes defeated the Quakers 87–84 to hand Penn their first loss of the season. In the consolation game of the Cabrillo Classic, the Quakers allowed San Diego State to score 110 points in a blowout loss.\nOn January 5, 1979, Penn began their Ivy League schedule with a game at Harvard. It was the first of five consecutive away games against Ivy League competition. The Quakers tallied 103 points in a win, which was followed the next day by a 52–44 triumph at Dartmouth. Penn then faced Temple, who were ranked 18th in the country at the time. Salters contributed 21 points, and Price had 19, in a 79–74 Quakers win. Princeton was the Quakers' next opponent; the Tigers were Penn's most formidable competition in the Ivy League. The Quakers were forced into overtime, but emerged with a one-point win. With a close 43–42 victory over Saint Joseph's, the Quakers guaranteed themselves at least a share of the Big 5 championship.\nFollowing a 97–85 win against Richmond, the Quakers hosted a top-10 Georgetown team on January 20. The game was tightly contested in the closing minutes, but a score by Georgetown center Tommy Scates with 1:16 remaining gave the Hoyas a lead they held for the rest of the contest, as Penn lost by two points. Afterwards, the Quakers went on a four-game winning streak, defeating Brown, Yale, Columbia, and Cornell by double digits. By this point, the Quakers' record had improved to 15–3, and they remained undefeated in the Ivy League. The streak ended with an 89–80 loss to Villanova, which prevented Penn from sweeping its Big 5 games. Regardless, the Quakers finished tied for first in the series, giving them their seventh title in a decade. Four further wins against Ivy League teams, including another one-point win over Princeton, brought the Quakers' record to 19–4. By the time Penn suffered its first defeat in 12 conference games, against Columbia, the team had clinched the Ivy League title and become the first NCAA tournament qualifiers of the season. With home wins over Yale and Brown, the Quakers ended the regular season 13–1 in the Ivy League record and 21–5 mark overall.\nPostseason.\nIn the NCAA Tournament, the Quakers were placed in the East region and given the number nine seed in that 10-team portion of the bracket. They were forced to play an opening round game on March 9 against first-time NCAA Tournament participant Iona. Behind a combined 28 points by Price and Willis, the Quakers jumped out to a 41–29 advantage at halftime, before an Iona rally in the second half brought the Gaels to within 57–55. Despite allowing the Gaels to cut their deficit to one point near the end of the second half, Penn did not relinquish their lead, holding on for a 73–69 win to advance to the second round. The result earned the Quakers a March 11 meeting with North Carolina, the number one seed in the East region and number three team in the country. Against coach Dean Smith's Tar Heels team, Price had 25 points and nine rebounds; he was one of four Quakers with at least 10 points. The Quakers gained the lead in the second half. Although the Tar Heels attempted a comeback, the Quakers managed a 72–71 victory.\nPenn's opponent in the East region's semifinals was Syracuse, which had become the favorite to advance to the Final Four after North Carolina and Duke had been knocked out. The Quakers played what Geoghegan called their \"best first half of the season\", and were up by 13 points at halftime. Syracuse came within five points at one stage in the second half, but Penn was able to clinch an 84–76 win. Price had 20 points for the Quakers, while Smith added 18. St. John's, which had previously eliminated Duke and was the team that received the final NCAA Tournament invitation as a 10 seed, was the Quakers' opponent in the regional final. Price and Smith made all 10 of their second half field goal attempts to help bring Penn back from a deficit. The game was tied with 23 seconds to play, when Salters was fouled and made two free throws to give Penn the lead. St. John's missed three shots in an attempt to tie the score before fouling Price, who scored 21 points in the game. His free throw attempt was no good, but St. John's was unable to get a shot off before the time expired, as the Quakers won 64–62. They became the first Ivy League team since Princeton in 1965 to reach the Final Four, and the fourth overall.\nThe Quakers' imminent appearance at the Final Four in Salt Lake City sparked celebrations on the University of Pennsylvania campus, including a rally that drew almost 10,000 fans. However, the team encountered difficulties in their preparation, as their practice facility was being used to host an indoor tennis event. Penn faced Michigan State, which featured Magic Johnson. The Spartans took a commanding lead early; writer Stefan Fatsis said that they \"missed what seemed like a hundred layups\" as Michigan State took a 31–6 lead. At halftime, the score was 50–17. Michigan State ultimately won 101–67. Johnson led the Spartans in their victory over the Quakers with 29 points, as he made nine of his 10 shot attempts and 11 of his 12 free throws; his 10 rebounds and 10 assists gave him a triple-double. For Penn, Price was the leading scorer with 18 points.\nThe Quakers then played a third-place game against DePaul, in which Price scored 21 first-half points (of his 31 overall) that helped reduce an early 23-point deficit to 11 by halftime. They rallied further in the second half, and a Salters basket with 11 seconds remaining tied the score at 85–85 and eventually forced overtime. However, Mark Aguirre scored eight points for the Blue Demons in the extra period, and the Quakers fell 96–93. Four Penn players fouled out, tied for the most ever in a Final Four game, as the team's fouls led to 34 DePaul free throw attempts. The defeat made the Quakers' final record 25–7.\nRankings.\nThe Quakers were ranked 14th in the final AP Poll, having never entered the top 20 during the regular season. Penn did not make an appearance in the Coaches Poll in 1978–79.\nAftermath and legacy.\nAfter being named the Ivy League Player of the Year for 1978–79, and scoring 23.7 points per game in the NCAA Tournament, Price was chosen by the Detroit Pistons in the 1979 NBA draft. In 1979–80, Penn had a 17–12 record, including an 11–3 mark in the Ivy League. The team again reached the NCAA tournament, but were knocked out in the second round. The following season, the Quakers won 20 games but did not make the tournament. Weinhauer coached one further season at Penn, in which St. John's defeated the Quakers in their first NCAA tournament game, before leaving the program for Arizona State.\nAs of 2019, the 1978–79 season is the only one in which the Quakers have reached the national semifinals in the NCAA Tournament. The program has advanced past the first round twice since then, in 1980 and 1994, and lost in the second round on both occasions. The 1978–79 Penn team was selected by \"USA Today\" in 2013 as the fourth most surprising Final Four participant. It was the first nine-seed in an NCAA Tournament to reach the Final Four, and no other team with the same seed advanced that far until 2013, when Wichita State did so. The 1978–79 Quakers were the last team from the Ivy League to play in the Final Four, and no team from the conference advanced as far as the regional semifinals again until Cornell in 2010."

        "text": "The International Ski Federation (FIS) Alpine Ski World Cup, the premier circuit for alpine skiing competition, began in January 1967, and the season marked the 54th consecutive year for the FIS World Cup. As it had every year since 2006 (when the Sölden races were cancelled by a snowstorm), the season began in Sölden, Austria in October. The season was supposed to end with the World Cup finals in March, which were to be held in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy for the first time since they began in 1993, but the finals were cancelled due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy.\nAs part of an effort to control the expansion of the World Cup circuit while fighting increased specialization, the city events were dropped this season, to be replaced by more parallel events at regular venues, while the Alpine combined was expanded. Due to the recent dominance of slalom specialists in the Alpine combined races, the format for that discipline was changed this season. As was previously the case, the first run continued to be the speed discipline (with Super-G having the preference over downhill). However, instead of the slalom run starting in reverse order of finish in the speed run, which allowed the slalom specialists (who tended to be slower in the speed run) to tackle fresh snow for their slalom run, while the speed specialists had to face the more challenging rutted snow at the end of the day, the skiers in the slalom run now started in the same order as the finish of the speed run, with the leader after the speed run becoming the first to race on the fresh slalom course.\nParallel format was also changed to make the race more TV-friendly. Parallel races now began with one classic qualification run with a single competitor on the slope (which was shown in the live TV broadcast), after which the top 32 qualifiers by time advanced to the elimination phase of the main competition. The round of 32 used the current run and re-run format, so that each competitor got to start from each side, but from the round of 16 forward, there was only one run per race and a direct knockout system. However, the new format immediately became controversial, as making two giant slalom courses equal in a single-run format proved impossible, and both the first men's and women's parallel giant slalom races suffered from \"the luck of the draw\" becoming determinative—in the men's race, all eight round-of-16 matches were won by the racer on the same randomly-selected course, and in the women's race, 17 of 20 winners came from the same course.\nIn addition, a new sixth discipline—parallel events (which combined parallel giant slalom and parallel slalom in points distribution)—was introduced, joining downhill, Super-G, giant slalom, slalom, and combined. A small crystal globe was to be awarded to the winner.\nOn 1 February 2020, then-women's World Cup overall leader (and 3-time defending champion) Mikaela Shiffrin's father Jeff suffered grave injuries in an accident, and Shiffrin immediately left the World Cup tour. His injuries proved fatal, and Shiffrin remained off the tour for the rest of the season.\nNations Cup.\nOverall\nMen\nLadies\nPrize money.\nTop-5 men\nTop-5 ladies\nRetirements.\nThe following athletes announced their retirements during or after the season:"

After graduating from Tulsa, Patterson was drafted by the Boston Celtics in the fifth round of the 1955 NBA draft. He was the first Hurricane player to be drafted by the NBA.\nPatterson left Tulsa as the school's all-time leading scorer and rebounder (both marks since eclipsed). He was the first basketball player selected to the school's athletic hall of fame as well as the first to have his jersey retired by the school.\nFollowing his basketball career, Patterson moved to private business.

        "title": "1958–59 North Dakota Fighting Sioux men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1958–59 North Dakota Fighting Sioux men's ice hockey team represented the University of North Dakota in college ice hockey. In its 2nd year under head coach Bob May the team compiled a 20–10–1 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the second time. The Fighting Sioux defeated Michigan State 4–3 in overtime to win the championship game at the RPI Field House in Troy, New York, the first national title hosted by an eastern school.\nSeason.\nComing off of their first trip to the NCAA tournament, North Dakota was hoping to improve on their Runner-Up finish. First, however, the Fighting Sioux had to deal with the collapse of their conference. While programs like North Dakota and Denver had fully embraced the blueprint that Michigan had lain down by recruiting mostly overaged Canadian players, Minnesota head coach John Mariucci had made it a policy for his team to stick with American players and soon found his team left behind. Rather than join the rest of the teams Minnesota withdrew from the WIHL, taking Michigan and Michigan State with them to form the ice hockey division of the Big Ten. Rather than form a small conference of their own the remaining four teams played as independents for the 1958–59 season.\nDespite being without a conference North Dakota played a very similar schedule to the one they had the year before. They still played each of the 6 other former WIHL teams and divided their time fairly evenly at home and on the road. After opening the season with two wins against the senior Winnipeg Maroons, North Dakota hit the road and split a pair of game at Michigan State. They returned home to take on Denver in a rematch of last season's national championship and took both close contests 4–3 with one win coming in extra time. After jumping out to a 5-1 start the Fighting Sioux slumped over the holiday break, tying then losing to the US National Team before dropping a match on the road with the Warroad Lakers. They lost their next game at home to Michigan Tech before finally stemming the tide with an overtime win the next night. Sporting a pedestrian 5-4-1 record UND went on an extended road trip through the great lakes.\nThe team's first stop was in Duluth where they took both games against an inferior Bulldogs squad. Afterwards they headed Ann Arbor and in the first game against the Wolverines the Fighting Sioux were beating up the home team so badly that the crowd couldn't contain themselves and ended up getting into a fight with the visitors. The game was stopped with 5:20 left in the third period and the remainder of the time was cancelled. The next night was a bit more subdued but North Dakota dropped the contest 2–4. After taking a week off the team returned to the area to take on Minnesota and Michigan Tech, splitting both series and beginning a six-game homestand with a respectable 11-7-1 record.\nNorth Dakota welcomed Colorado College and won both games against the once-fearsome Tigers. After splitting yet another series against Michigan State the Fighting Sioux finished their home schedule with a pair of wins against Minnesota. For their final weekend North Dakota headed to Colorado to face the Pioneers and Tigers twice each in a 5-day span. Despite fatigue and elevation North Dakota acquitted themselves well by splitting both series and ending with an 18-10-1 record.\nWith the dissolution of the WIHL the NCAA selection committee had to use a new metric to determine which two western team would make the tournament. In the end they settled on using a similar method to how they choose eastern teams; they gave the top seed to the Big Ten Champion, Michigan State, then picked the best remaining team as the second semifinalist. While Michigan Tech had split its series with North Dakota during the season they finished with a worse record. Denver, on the other hand, ended with a stellar 22-5-1 mark and possessed the best offense in the country. There was, however, a problem. While most teams had a relatively balanced schedule, Denver had played only five of its 26 games on the road. Additionally, three of those game came against Colorado College. This meant that during the entire season Denver left their state only once and when they did they lost both game against North Dakota. Because of Denver's rather sizable home ice advantage their schedule was seen as far less strenuous than the Fighting Sioux's. In the end it may have been UND's 3–1 record against the Pioneers that tipped the scales in their favor but in any event North Dakota was awarded the second western seed, much to the displeasure of the Denver faithful.\nNorth Dakota headed to the eastern time zone for the first time all season to take on Tri-State League champion St. Lawrence. The Saints battled the Fighting Sioux to a 3-3 tie after regulation and were hoping to head to their first National Title in their fourth appearance but a goal by UND's Guy LaFrance sent the Fighting Sioux back to the championship game. In the other semifinal Michigan State dropped Boston College by an identical 4–3 score, though they didn't require extra time. In the fifth meeting that season the Spartans opened the scoring in a close-checking first period, ending with a one-goal advantage due to an Ed Pollesel marker. In the second period North Dakota found their legs and completely took the game over, outshooting MSU 17–4 and outscoring their opponent 3–0. Once the third period began the pendulum swung completely in the other direction and it was Sparty's turn to take over, scoring twice in the final twelve minutes of play to tie the game and send the national championship into overtime. North Dakota hadn't lost an overtime game in over two years and head coach Bob May confessed to being nervous about that statistic. His team may have picked up on that because they didn't record a shot for more than four minutes but when they did they made it count and Reg Morelli scored to give the Fighting Sioux their first national title.\nMorelli was awarded the tournament MOP and was joined by Ed Thomlinson on the All-Tournament first team while Ralph Lyndon and Joe Poole appeared on the second team.\nBill Steenson was the only player on the team to find his way onto the AHCA All-American West Team and while Bob May received a great deal of support for the Spencer Penrose Award the trophy went to Harry Cleverly.\nAfter the season May left the team to coach minor professional hockey for a year before entering dental school. The team was not left in the lurch, however, as assistant coach Barry Thorndycraft took over the reins.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "title": "2019 Roger Federer tennis season",
        "text": "Roger Federer's 2019 tennis season officially began on 30 December 2018, with the start of the Hopman Cup. His season ended on 16 November 2019, with a loss in the semifinals of the ATP Finals. Despite failing to defend his title at the Australian Open, Federer was able to maintain his ranking of World No. 3 by the end of the year. \nIn this season, Federer won his 28th and final Masters 1000 title in Miami and his final career title in Basel. He ended his professional rivalry with Rafael Nadal in the semifinals of Wimbledon and contested his 12th and last major final of his career, losing to Novak Djokovic. Finally, Federer made his final appearance in a Masters 1000 tournament in Shanghai as well as his final US Open and ATP Finals appearances. \nYear summary.\nEarly hard court season.\nHopman Cup.\nAs in the past two seasons, Roger Federer paired with Belinda Bencic at the Hopman Cup, representing Switzerland. Federer defeated Cameron Norrie from Great Britain, Frances Tiafoe from the United States and Stefanos Tsitsipas from Greece, all in straight sets, to help Switzerland advance to the final. The tie against the United States was remarkable for staging the first-ever meeting between Federer and Serena Williams, considered one of the best female tennis players of all time, in a mixed doubles match alongside Bencic and Tiafoe.\nWith Federer defeating Alexander Zverev in straight sets, and like in the previous year, they defeated Germany 2–1 in the final to clinch Federer's third and Switzerland's fourth Hopman Cup title overall. The mixed doubles title match was decided in the final point, with Bencic forcing an error from Zverev to help Switzerland win the match and the tournament.\nAustralian Open.\nAs the two-time defending champion, Federer entered the first Grand Slam tournament of the season, the Australian Open, as the No. 3 seed. His first match was a straight-sets victory over Denis Istomin, followed by another one against Daniel Evans. In the third round he defeated Taylor Fritz, again in straight sets, but was upset by Stefanos Tsitsipas in the fourth round, losing in four tight sets.\nBeing the defending champion and as a result of losing in the fourth round, he dropped out of the Top 5 in the ATP rankings. In a post-tournament interview, he admitted that he planned to play the clay court season in 2019, after two years of skipping it.\nDubai Tennis Championships.\nAfter skipping the tournament in 2018, Federer returned to Dubai to play the Dubai Tennis Championships. Having dropped to No. 7 in the world two weeks before, he was the tournament's No. 2 seed. In the first two rounds, he defeated Philipp Kohlschreiber and Fernando Verdasco in three sets, advancing to a quarterfinal match against Márton Fucsovics. Federer defeated Fucsovics in straight sets, booking his place in the semifinals to face the 22-year-old and No. 6 seed Borna Ćorić. He defeated Ćorić, also in straight sets, to set a final against another youngster, Stefanos Tsitsipas, in a rematch from their Australian Open encounter in January – which Federer lost. By defeating Tsitsipas in straight sets, Federer won the tournament and made history by becoming the second male tennis player in history to reach 100 singles titles. With his victory, he returned to No. 4 in the ATP rankings.\nIndian Wells Masters.\nFresh off his victory in Dubai, Federer began his participation in the Indian Wells Masters by defeating Peter Gojowczyk in straight sets on the second round, after getting a first round bye. He then defeated his fellow countryman Stan Wawrinka in dominant fashion, also in straight sets, to book his first ever meeting with Kyle Edmund in the fourth round. He defeated Edmund in straight sets to secure a place in the quarterfinals, setting up another first ever encounter with Hubert Hurkacz. Federer defeated Hurkacz, again in two sets, to set a blockbuster semifinal with Rafael Nadal, which would have been the thirty-ninth meeting in their famous rivalry. However, Nadal was forced to withdraw from the tournament due to a knee injury sustained in his last match – and therefore, Federer reached a record-breaking ninth tournament final. In the final, he was defeated by the No. 7 seed Dominic Thiem in a three-set match.\nMiami Open.\nFederer next played in the Miami Open as the No. 4 seed, following the withdrawal of Rafael Nadal. This was the first edition of the tournament following the location change from Key Biscayne to the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens. After the usual first round bye, he defeated Radu Albot, Filip Krajinović and the No. 13 seed Daniil Medvedev in succession to advance to a quarterfinal match with the No. 6 seed Kevin Anderson. With a bagel in the first set, he defeated Anderson in straight sets. This was Federer's 1200th match win in his professional career, setting up a semifinal against the 19-year-old Denis Shapovalov – a first time encounter between the two. Federer ended up easily defeating Shapovalov to reach his third final of the season. He also became the first player to reach 50 Masters 1000 tournament finals, breaking the tie with Rafael Nadal. In the final, he defeated John Isner in straight sets to win the 28th Masters 1000 title of his career.\nSpring clay court season.\nMadrid Open.\nFor the first time in three years, Roger Federer committed to play the spring clay court season. His first tournament was the Madrid Open, a Masters 1000 tournament, which he played as the No. 4 seed. In his first clay court match since 2016, and after a first round bye, he defeated Richard Gasquet in straight sets – on the twentieth meeting between the two – in under an hour of play. In the third round, he defeated Gaël Monfils in three sets, with the final set decided in a tiebreak after saving two match points. Therefore, he reached the quarterfinals, where he lost to Dominic Thiem in three sets – this time squandering two match points himself in the second set tiebreak.\nItalian Open.\nFollowing the loss at the Madrid Open, Federer confirmed his presence at the Italian Open on the week after. After a first round bye, and due to a rain delay on the day before, Federer defeated João Sousa – in straight sets – and Borna Ćorić – in a third set tiebreak, saving once again two match points – on the same day, in the second and third rounds, respectively, to qualify for the quarterfinals. However, he was forced to withdraw before the match against Stefanos Tsitsipas due to a right leg injury.\nFrench Open.\nFor the first time in four years, Federer played the season's second and only clay court major, the French Open. He entered the tournament as the No. 3 seed and made a successful return by defeating Lorenzo Sonego in straight sets. He advanced to the quarterfinals without losing a set, defeating lucky loser Oscar Otte, 20-year-old Casper Ruud, and Leonardo Mayer, to set up an encounter with compatriot and 2015 champion Stan Wawrinka, who defeated him the last time he entered the tournament. After four tight sets, Federer defeated Wawrinka to set up a semifinal clash with Rafael Nadal, resuming their storied rivalry at the French Open for the sixth time. Federer ended up losing in straight sets to Nadal, ending his French Open run in the semifinals.\nGrass court season.\nHalle Open.\nFederer opened his grass court season at the Halle Open, where he was a nine-time tournament winner, as the No. 1 seed. In the first round he defeated John Millman, who defeated him in the fourth round of last year's US Open. He then survived consecutive three-set battles against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Roberto Bautista Agut to advance to a fifteenth semifinal in Halle. There, he easily defeated Pierre-Hugues Herbert to reach a record-extending thirteenth final, where he bested David Goffin in straight sets to capture a record-extending tenth Halle title and No. 102 overall. This marked the first time in his career that Federer won a single event 10 times.\nWimbledon.\nDue to his victory in Halle, Federer advanced to Wimbledon – the third Grand Slam of the season – as the No. 2 seed. He started the tournament with a four-set victory over Lloyd Harris. In the next three rounds, he defeated Jay Clarke, No. 27 seed Lucas Pouille and No. 17 seed Matteo Berrettini, without losing a set. In a quarterfinal clash with the world No. 7 Kei Nishikori, Federer won in four sets, advancing to his thirteenth Wimbledon semifinal and becoming the first man in history to win 100 matches at a Grand Slam tournament. Eleven years after their epic 2008 final, he defeated his rival Rafael Nadal in the semifinals after four sets. It was the fortieth encounter in their rivalry. Federer then faced Novak Djokovic in the final, against whom he lost in a five set thriller lasting four hours and fifty seven minutes, despite having two championship points on serve in the fifth set. The match also marked the first time that a fifth set tiebreaker was played at 12–12 in a singles match and was the longest men's final in Wimbledon history.\nNorth American hard court season.\nCincinnati Masters.\nFederer made his first appearance since the Wimbledon final at the Cincinnati Masters, the season's seventh Masters 1000 tournament, as the No. 3 seed, after withdrawing from the Canadian Open played the week before. After a first round bye, he defeated Juan Ignacio Londero, in the second round, on his opening match. In the third round, however, he lost in straight sets to Andrey Rublev.\nUS Open.\nFederer moved on to New York City to play the US Open, the season's last Grand Slam, as the No. 3 seed. He opened his participation with a four-set win against qualifier Sumit Nagal, booking a second round encounter with Damir Džumhur. With this first round win, he qualified for a record-extending seventeenth ATP Finals. Despite losing the first set again, he defeated Džumhur in four sets. Then, Federer easily defeated Daniel Evans in the third round and David Goffin in the fourth round, both in straight sets, in 80 and 79 minutes, respectively, to advance to the quarterfinals. This marked the thirteenth time that Federer has reached the quarterfinal stage at the US Open, tying Andre Agassi and only trailing Jimmy Connors' seventeen times. He lost to Grigor Dimitrov in a five-setter, despite having taken a two-sets-to-one lead.\nAsian swing.\nShanghai Masters.\nFederer's return to the ATP Tour level tournaments happened in Shanghai, for the Shanghai Masters. He was the No. 2 seed and therefore had a bye in the first round. In the second and third rounds, he defeated Albert Ramos Viñolas and David Goffin, both in straight sets, to advance to a quarterfinal meeting against Alexander Zverev. Despite having saved five match points in the second set, he ended up losing in three sets to Zverev.\nEuropean indoor hard court season.\nSwiss Indoors.\nFederer advanced to his hometown tournament, the Swiss Indoors, as the two-time defending champion. His first round match, against Peter Gojowczyk, is remarkable for being the 1500th match of his career. He easily defeated Gojowczyk, in the first round, and Radu Albot, in the second round, both in straight sets, to reach a quarterfinal match against Stan Wawrinka. However, due to a back injury, Wawrinka was forced to withdraw from the match – and therefore, Federer advanced to the semifinals. In the semifinals, he defeated the world No. 7 Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets, earning his fiftieth win of the season and successfully advancing to the tournament final. In the final, he defeated Alex de Minaur in straight sets to win a record-extending tenth Swiss Indoors title without dropping a set.\nParis Masters.\nIn the following week, Federer was scheduled to play the last Masters 1000 tournament of the season, the Paris Masters. However, he had to withdraw from the tournament to manage his schedule and to prepare for the ATP Finals.\nATP Finals.\nThe last official tournament of the season, for Federer, was the ATP Finals in London. As the No. 3 seed, he was drawn in the group Björn Borg along with Novak Djokovic, Dominic Thiem and Matteo Berrettini. His first match was a straight-set loss to Thiem, followed by a victory in straight sets against Berretini to keep him alive in the group standings. His last group match was a straight-set win against Djokovic, his first victory against him since the 2015 edition of the tournament. Therefore, he finished the group in second place and advanced to the semifinals. There, he lost in straight sets to Stefanos Tsitsipas, in the match that officially ended his season.\nAll matches.\nThis table chronicles all the matches of Roger Federer in 2019, including walkovers (W/O) which the ATP does not count as wins.\nYearly records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\nATP and Grand Slam sanctioned matches.\nRoger Federer has a ATP match win–loss record in the 2019 season.

        "text": "USA Badminton (USAB) is the national governing body for the sport of badminton in the United States. There are currently 66 badminton clubs registered .\nHistory.\nThe American Badminton Association was founded in 1936 when Donald Wilbur, Robert McMillan, Donald Richardson, and Phillip Richardson decided to unite various badminton groups in the country. The name was changed to United States Badminton Association in 1978, and later changed to its present name in 1996.\nUSA Badminton used to train its elite players at a national training center in Colorado Springs, but they relocated to Anaheim in early 2017.\nBadminton is not a popular sport in the United States for several reasons. One of the main reasons is that badminton in the U.S. is seen as a backyard sport. Due to this, the sport has not grown much. Another reason is the lack of Olympic success by American athletes. This lack of success is another reason why the sport has not grown in comparison to other sports. Finally, wages are a huge reason why badminton has not gown. Badminton fails to receive substantial media attention in the United States and with that comes low wages. Participants can earn up to $15,000 for winning a championship, which is a relatively small amount of money in comparison to an average football player that has a salary of $2.7 million.\nControversy.\nIn January 2023, it was reported that USA Badminton had paid $1 million to settle a dispute with a former employee who previously served as the federation's chief of staff and SafeSport compliance officer. The former employee claimed he had been fired in retaliation for reporting allegations of sexual abuse by a prominent coach to the U.S. Center for SafeSport, after being pressured by USA Badminton's CEO and its general counsel. U.S. law requires any employees of a national governing body to report suspicions of abuse immediately to law enforcement and to SafeSport. Earlier, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley, Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, warned the leadership of USA Badminton about their potential breaches and alleged obstruction of an investigation by SafeSport."

        "text": "John M. Wessels (February 13, 1938 – December 3, 1994) was an American college basketball standout for Illinois in the late 1950s and early 1960s. A center, Wessels averaged 13.4 points and 8.7 rebounds per game in his three years of varsity basketball for the Fighting Illini, earning a varsity letter each year. Graduating from Rockford West High School, Wessels led the Warriors to the IHSA state championship during consecutive seasons in 1955 and 1956.\nHigh school.\nWessels was an outstanding high school basketball player at Rockford West High School, where he led the Warriors to consecutive IHSA boys' championships in 1955 and 1956, both seasons with 28-1 records. In his two years of varsity basketball, Wessels scored 1,178 points in 55 of 58 games, averaging 21.4 points per game and named second team all-conference at center. During the 1954-55 season, Wessels' West Warriors would lose only to Rock Island High School during the regular season. Ironically, his team would complete the championship by defeating fellow Big 8 Conference opponent, Elgin by a final score of 61 to 59 in a thriller that witnessed arguably the most unique play in a state championship known as the \"6-Point Second\" In the four game tournament, Wessels would score 51 points, averaging 12.8 points per game.\nAs a senior, Wessels would begin the year on the bench due to an indiscretion that suspended him from school. Based on the suspension, Wessels missed the first three games of the year, including the team's only loss at Moline High School. In his 26 games played during the season, Wessels would lead the team in scoring at 648 points, averaging 24.9 points per game and he would be named second team all-state and all-conference at the center position. When the conference portion of the season ended, the Warriors compiled a 19-1 record. During district and sectional play, Wessels' team was only challenged one time by Galesburg High School in a double-overtime sudden-death victory, earning the team the chance to play at Huff Gymnasium in Champaign. This season the Warriors would face Edwardsville High School for the state championship. Edwardsville had future Fighting Illini teammates Govoner Vaughn and Mannie Jackson, both who would become members of the Harlem Globetrotters. During the four game tournament, Wessels would lead all scorers with 107 points and be named to the all-tournament team with teammates Nolden Gentry and Don Slaughter as well as Vaughn and Jackson.\nIn 1974, Wessels was inducted into the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association's Hall of Fame as a player.\nIn 2007, the Illinois High School Association named Wessels one of the 100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament.\nUniversity of Illinois.\nIn the fall of 1956, Wessels initially enrolled at North Carolina State and was a member of the freshman basketball team. After only one season, Wessels transferred to the University of Illinois in the fall of 1957, playing on the freshman basketball team. In his sophomore year he was the starting center of the 1958-59 Fighting Illini team that finished fifth in the Big Ten with a 12–10 record. As a junior, during the 1959-60 season, Wessels maintained his starting center role on a team that finished third in the conference with an overall record of 16–7. The pinnacle of his career was the 1960–61 season, Wessels earned the distinction of being an honorable mention All-American on an Illini team that finished their schedule with an overall record of 9 and 15, seventh place in the Big Ten. \nIn his three years of varsity basketball, Wessels would play in 60 games, collect 521 total rebounds while scoring 803 points, averaging 13.4 points per game. After the conclusion of the season, he would be drafted in the 8th round of the 1961 NBA draft by the Chicago Packers.\nProfessional career and after.\nAfter completing his undergraduate studies, Wessels played briefly in the American Basketball League for the Chicago Majors and Pittsburgh Rens. During his time with Chicago, Wessels played in 64 games, pulled down 319 rebounds, had 45 assists and scored 639 points. Based on the fact that the ABL ceased operations in January 1963, Wessels playing career came to an abrupt end.\nWessels became the sales manager of Kinetico Water Systems in his hometown of Rockford. In December 1994, at the age of 56, Wessels died of cancer."

        "text": "Rogue is a professional esports organization with teams competing across several different titles in Europe and the United States. It has two \"League of Legends\" teams based in Europe: a main team that participates in the League of Legends European Championship (LEC), and an academy team that participates in the Ultraliga. Team Rogue was founded by Franklin Villarreal, Derek Nelson and Carson Knuth in 2016, and acquired by now parent and management company ReKTGlobal and its partners in 2018. ReKTGlobal also owns the Call of Duty League team, the London Royal Ravens. The organization is co-owned by prominent DJ Steve Aoki and YouTuber Vikram \"Vikkstar123\" Barn. Other Investors include Imagine Dragons, Rudy Gobert, Nicky Romero, Nick Gross and Landon Collins.\nOn October 6, 2022, Rogue announced a merger with KOI, an esports organisation owned by Ibai Llanos and Gerard Piqué. This will result in the existing Rogue teams rebranding to KOI. Following Infinite Reality's split with KOI in 2023, the team was reestablished.\n\"League of Legends\".\nOn November 20, 2018, Riot Games announced that Rogue would be one of ten franchise partners participating in the newly rebranded League of Legends European Championship (LEC).\nFor the 2019 LEC Spring Split, Rogue signed Kim \"Profit\" Jun-hyung, Mateusz \"Kikis\" Szkudlarek, Chres \"Sencux\" Laursen, Martin \"HeaQ\" Kordmaa and Kim \"Wadid\" Bae-in. On December 21, 2019, Rogue announced a partnership with Polish esports organization x-kom AGO in the Ultraliga, with Rogue remaining responsible for the team itself and x-kom AGO responsible for \"establish(ing) a training presence in Warsaw and a dedicated marketing approach.\"\nFollowing a 10th place finish in their first split, Rogue promoted a majority of their academy team players for the 2019 LEC Summer split. This resulted in significant improvement, going from a 2–16 record in their first split to 7–11 in their second and qualifying for playoffs, where they lost a 1–3 game against Schalke 04 Esports. Building on this improvement, Hans Sama was brought in to replace Woolite. This saw the team compete for the top spot for the first time, notably placing first in the 2020 LEC Summer regular season. Despite a 2–3 loss against G2 Esports, Rogue qualified for the 2020 World Championship, where they finished 13–16th with just a single win in their group, against PSG Talon.\nAhead of 2021, Rogue saw several changes to their roster. Odoamne was signed from Schalke 04 Esports, while Trymbi was promoted from the academy team. This resulted in the team climbing up the ladder in the region, finishing second in the 2021 LEC Spring Split, losing against MAD Lions in the grand finals by being reverse swept in the finals. With the same roster for Summer, Rogue finished 3rd following a 1–3 loss against Fnatic, handing them the third seed at the 2021 League of Legends World Championship. They were put in the group along DWG KIA, FunPlus Phoenix, and Cloud9, where they finished third and were eliminated following a tiebreaker loss against Cloud9.\nInspired left the team in the off-season, joining North American side Evil Geniuses. French botlaner Hans Sama was acquired by Team Liquid. Joining as their replacements were Malrang from DWG KIA and Comp from Team Vitality. This roster would start off the season without losses in the first round robin stage but would place second in playoffs following an 0–3 loss against G2 Esports. In Summer, the team performed less strong in the regular season by placing 3rd, but managed to win their first LEC title by beating G2 Esports. They became the only Western team to make it to the 2022 League of Legends World Championship Knockout Stage, where they fell against JD Gaming to finish 5–8th in their final event.\n\"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege\".\nOn August 24, 2017, Rogue signed the former roster of Vertical Gaming: John \"Avian\" Ackerly, Tyler \"Ecl9pse\" McMullin, George \"KingGeorge\" Kassa, Spencer \"Slashug\" Oliver, Austin \"Yung\" Trexler, and Tristan \"Ranger\" Perhson. Four days later, Yung left Rogue to return to Continuum; he was replaced with Bryan \"Bryan\" Agema on September 12. Kevin \"Easilyy\" Skokowski joined on December 22 after KingGeorge benched himself and eventually left due to family issues.\nOn March 19, 2018, Emilio \"Geo\" Leynez Cuevas joined the team to replace Avian. On September 3, Geo and Bryan both left Rogue and were later replaced by Aaron \"Shuttle\" Dugger and Seth \"supr\" Hoffman, though supr would leave two months later. Franklyn \"VertcL\" Cordero replaced Supr on November 28, three days after the latter left.\nRogue finished first at Dreamhack Valencia 2019 and qualified for the Six Major Raleigh 2019. At the Six Major 2019, Rogue placed ninth to twelfth after defeating Cyclops Athlete Gaming while losing to Team Secret twice in the group stage. After disappointing results at the Six Major Raleigh 2019, Ranger left the team and was replaced by the team's analyst, Eric \"Reaper\" Nohl. Taylor \"Redeemer\" Mayeur, an ex-Spacestation Gaming player, joined the team as a coach on October 9, 2019.\nAfter the team was relegated to Challenger League, Ecl9pse, VertcL, and Slashug all left and joined different teams and causing the disbanding of the team. This left Rogue without a spot in Challenger League due to the rule requiring 3/5 players to retain a spot.\nShortly after though, on January 6, 2020, Rogue announced their buy out of the Vodafone Giants roster and the release of the remaining members of the North American roster. The buy out of the new roster had given them a spot in the European Rainbow 6 Pro League Season XI and the Six Invitational 2020. The team placed last at the Six Invitational 2020 after losing to Natus Vincere and eventual champions, Spacestation Gaming.\nIn 2021, with the add of Prano they avoided relegations by placing fourth in EUL Stage 3 and they qualified for the Six Sweden Major.\nThe victory over Team oNe in the quarterfinals gave Rogue a spot for the upcoming S.I. In August 2022 Rogue won against Faze Clan in the Six Major Berlin grand final, earning the EU region its first international Trophy since 2019."

        "title": "Royal Rumble (2020)",
        "text": "The 2020 Royal Rumble was the 33rd annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on January 26, 2020, at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas.\nTraditionally, the Royal Rumble match winner receives a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 2020 event, the winners of both the men's and women's matches received a choice of which championship to challenge for at WrestleMania 36. The men could choose to challenge for either Raw's WWE Championship or SmackDown's Universal Championship, while the women had the choice between the Raw Women's Championship and the SmackDown Women's Championship. Additionally and for the first time, NXT's championships were eligible choices, which added the NXT Championship and the NXT Women's Championship, thus being the first Royal Rumble since 2010 in which there were three eligible championships for the Rumble winner to challenge for.\nEight matches were contested at the event, including two on the Kickoff pre-show. In the main event, Raw's Drew McIntyre won the men's Royal Rumble match by last eliminating SmackDown's Roman Reigns, while Raw's Charlotte Flair won the women's Royal Rumble match by last eliminating NXT's Shayna Baszler. Other prominent matches saw \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt retain the Universal Championship against Daniel Bryan in a strap match, Roman Reigns defeated King Corbin in a Falls Count Anywhere match, and Becky Lynch defeated Asuka by submission to retain the Raw Women's Championship. The event also featured the in-ring return of Edge, who last wrestled in April 2011 before retiring from a neck injury, as well as MVP, who last wrestled for WWE in December 2010.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick event produced every January by WWE since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views (PPV), along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, dubbed the \"Big Four\". It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. Announced on February 15, 2019, the 2020 event was the 33rd Royal Rumble and was scheduled to be held on January 26, 2020, at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas. It featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions, with some NXT wrestlers and WWE veterans appearing in both the men's and women's Royal Rumble matches. In addition to airing on traditional PPV, the event was available to livestream on the WWE Network. Travel packages became available on September 12 while individual tickets went on sale on September 20.\nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers and the winner traditionally earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the past two years, the men and women had the choice to challenge for the top championships of the Raw and SmackDown brands at WrestleMania. In September 2019, NXT was recognized as WWE's third main brand, evidenced by its inclusion in the brand competition at the 2019 Survivor Series. Although the 2020 Royal Rumble was not promoted as an NXT event, for the first time, its titles became eligible for the Royal Rumble winners to challenge for, also marking the first time since 2010 in which the men had three championship choices. For the 2020 event, the men could choose between Raw's WWE Championship, SmackDown's Universal Championship, and the NXT Championship to challenge for at WrestleMania 36, while the women had the choice between the Raw Women's Championship, SmackDown Women's Championship, and NXT Women's Championship. This also made the 2020 event the first time women had three options.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised eight matches, including two on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"Friday Night SmackDown\".\nRaw.\nWhile the WWE Championship is generally defended at every year's Royal Rumble pay-per-view, on the January 6 episode of \"Raw\", it was revealed that there would not be a WWE Championship defense at 2020's event. Instead, as he felt that there was no one on any brand who deserved an opportunity, WWE Champion Brock Lesnar decided to enter himself into the Royal Rumble match as entrant number one. There were no changes to the rules of the match, despite Lesnar holding one of the world championships that the winner could challenge for at WrestleMania 36. On the January 20 episode, Lesnar's advocate Paul Heyman reminded the fans of the prize of the Royal Rumble match, but said that there was no one worthy enough to face Lesnar in the main event of WrestleMania, implying that if Lesnar won, he would abstain his prize.\nAt , The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka and Kairi Sane) defeated the team of Raw Women's Champion Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match to retain the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship. In a backstage interview on the following \"Raw\", Lynch stated that she had not been herself the past few months and felt that management had been putting her into tag team matches to protect her from facing Asuka alone and losing. She also stated that she had never defeated Asuka and needed to change that. The following week, Lynch challenged Asuka to a match with her Raw Women's Championship on the line which Asuka accepted. The match was scheduled for the Royal Rumble as essentially a rematch from last year's event.\nOn the TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs Kickoff pre-show, Humberto Carrillo defeated Andrade. On the following episode of \"Raw\", both were scheduled to participate in a gauntlet match to determine the number one contender against Rey Mysterio for the United States Championship. Carrillo advanced to the final to face Andrade, who did not appear during his entrance. Andrade instead attacked Carrillo from behind and then performed a Hammerlock DDT on Carillo onto the exposed concrete floor. Due to this, the gauntlet match ended in a no-contest. Andrade then won the US title from Mysterio at a WWE Live event in Madison Square Garden on December 26. After Andrade retained the title against Mysterio in a ladder match on the January 20 episode of \"Raw\", Andrade attempted to perform the Hammerlock DDT on Mysterio on the exposed concrete floor, only for Carrillo to appear to aid Mysterio and fought off Andrade, who retreated along with Zelina Vega. Backstage, Carrillo issued a challenge to Andrade for the United States Championship at the Royal Rumble, which was made official for the Kickoff pre-show.\nSmackDown.\nAt Survivor Series, \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt defeated Daniel Bryan to retain the Universal Championship. On the following \"SmackDown\", after Bryan accepted another rematch for the title at TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs, The Fiend appeared and attacked Bryan, ripping out his hair. The Miz, who had been intertwined in the feud, appeared the following week and said that Bryan had not been seen since The Fiend's attack and in turn became Wyatt's opponent in a non-title match at TLC, where Wyatt (as his Firefly Fun House character and not The Fiend) defeated Miz. Following the match, a hooded figure attacked Wyatt and then revealed himself as a returning Bryan, now with a buzz cut and shorter beard. On the following \"SmackDown\", both Bryan and Miz stated their desire to take the Universal Championship from Wyatt due to their respective personal issues with him. They were then interrupted by King Corbin, who felt that he deserved an opportunity for the title due to his victory over Roman Reigns at TLC. On the December 27 episode, Bryan defeated Miz and Corbin in a triple threat match to earn another Universal Championship match against The Fiend at the Royal Rumble. On the January 17 episode, Bryan delivered a running knee to The Fiend and attacked him, only for The Fiend to retreat. Frustrated, Bryan changed the stipulation of their match to a strap match so that The Fiend could not run away.\nDuring the triple threat match to determine the number one contender for the Universal Championship, Roman Reigns attacked King Corbin, costing him the title opportunity. The following week, Reigns announced his participation in the Royal Rumble match. Later that night, Reigns teamed with Daniel Bryan to face Corbin and Dolph Ziggler which ended in a no-contest. Following the match, Corbin and Ziggler attacked Reigns only for The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) to return and aid Reigns by attacking both Corbin and Ziggler. On the January 10 episode, Corbin announced his participation in the Royal Rumble match and stated that Reigns was scared to face him again, hence why Reigns was also competing in the match. In response, Reigns challenged Corbin to a rematch at the event which Corbin accepted. The following week, Reigns defeated the returning Robert Roode in a tables match, allowing him to choose the stipulation for his match with Corbin, and he chose a Falls Count Anywhere match.\nOn the \"SmackDown\" following Survivor Series, SmackDown Women's Champion Bayley and Team SmackDown women's captain Sasha Banks criticized their brand's women's division for letting them down at the event, as both Bayley and Team SmackDown lost their respective matches. Team member Lacey Evans interrupted and performed a Women's Right on Banks, with Evans turning face. Evans questioned the leadership of both Bayley and Banks, having several confrontations with them over the following weeks. On the January 10 episode, Evans was scheduled to face Banks, who no-showed and Bayley appeared on the TitanTron, taunting Evans. In response, Evans went backstage where the two brawled. The following week, Evans was once again scheduled to face Banks, however, Banks was unable to compete due to her injured ankle. Bayley took her place in the match, but lost to Evans. Due to Evans' win, she earned herself a title match at the Royal Rumble.\nAfter a seven-month hiatus, Sheamus appeared in a vignette on the November 29 episode of \"SmackDown\", announcing that he would be returning to in-ring action. Over the next several weeks, more vignettes aired, with Sheamus claiming that SmackDown had become soft in his absence. On the January 3 episode, as Shorty G was being attacked by The Revival (Scott Dawson and Dash Wilder), Sheamus returned, seemingly to aid Shorty G. However, after The Revival cleared the ring, Sheamus delivered a Brogue Kick to Shorty G. Sheamus claimed that Shorty G embodied everything wrong with SmackDown and continued to target him over the next few weeks, and a match between the two was scheduled for the Royal Rumble Kickoff pre-show.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nTwo matches were contested on the Royal Rumble Kickoff pre-show. In the first match, Sheamus faced Shorty G. In the end, Sheamus performed a Brogue Kick on Shorty G to win the match.\nThe second match saw Andrade defend the United States Championship against Humberto Carrillo. The end saw Carrillo attempt a hurricanrana on Andrade, who countered into a roll-up to retain the title.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with Roman Reigns facing King Corbin in a Falls Count Anywhere match. Mid-way through the match, Reigns fought with Corbin in the crowd where Reigns performed a Samoan Drop on Corbin through two separate tables. As Reigns was about to attack Corbin near some production equipment, Reigns was attacked by Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode. The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) then came out and attacked Ziggler and Roode with Jimmy performing a Samoan Drop on Jey, Roode, and Ziggler. Reigns then shoved Corbin into a portable toilet, tipped it over, and continued to attack Corbin throughout the crowd. In the end, Reigns performed a Superman Punch and Spear on Corbin atop a dugout to win the match.\nBackstage, Kevin Owens told Samoa Joe that he could not wait to eliminate Seth Rollins from the Royal Rumble match—as they had been feuding for weeks on \"Raw\"—and that he would go on to win. Joe stated that he also could not wait to do the same, but if Owens got in his way, he would eliminate him.\nNext was the women's Royal Rumble match, which began with SmackDown's Alexa Bliss as the first entrant and NXT's Bianca Belair as the second. During the match, Raw's Lana (the fifth entrant) and Liv Morgan (the seventh entrant) eliminated each other due to their ongoing rivalry. As SmackDown's Mandy Rose (the eighth entrant) was seemingly eliminated, she landed on top of Otis, who was on the floor. Belair attempted to eliminate Rose again, only for Otis to catch Rose. As Belair eliminated Rose's tag team partner Sonya Deville (the tenth entrant), Deville fell onto Rose and Otis, knocking Otis down and unintentionally eliminating Rose along with herself. Belair would go on to break Michelle McCool and Charlotte Flair's tied record of five eliminations in a single women's Royal Rumble match (McCool set the record in 2018 and Flair tied it in 2019), only to be eliminated by Raw's Charlotte Flair (#17). Mighty Molly, Naomi, Beth Phoenix, Kelly Kelly, and Santina Marella (entrants 3, 18, 19, 21, and 29, respectively) were all surprise entrants. NXT's Shayna Baszler entered last and ended up tying Belair's record of eight eliminations. In the climax, after Baszler eliminated Phoenix, Baszler attempted to eliminate Flair, but Flair prevented herself from being eliminated and eliminated Baszler to win the match and earn herself a women's championship match of her choosing at WrestleMania 36.\nAfter that, Bayley defended the SmackDown Women's Championship against Lacey Evans. In the end, as Evans attempted a moonsault, Bayley avoided it and pinned Evans whilst holding the tights to retain the title.\nNext, \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt defended the Universal Championship against Daniel Bryan in a strap match. The Fiend dominated the first half of the match, whipping Bryan with the strap. Bryan eventually gained the offense, and applied the LeBell Lock, using the strap to crank back on The Fiend's head. As Bryan attempted a running knee, The Fiend caught Bryan and performed a Sister Abigail for a near fall. Bryan then performed a running knee on The Fiend for a nearfall. In the end, The Fiend applied The Mandible Claw, and as Bryan tried to escape, The Fiend picked him up and performed a chokeslam while still applying the Mandible Claw to win the match and retain the title. Following the match, medical personnel tended to Bryan.\nIn the penultimate match, Becky Lynch defended the Raw Women's Championship against Asuka (accompanied by Kairi Sane). In the climax, as Asuka attempted to spit green mist in Lynch's face, Lynch kicked Asuka, causing her to spit the mist in the air and into her own face. Lynch then applied the Dis-arm-her on Asuka, forcing her to submit and retain the title.\nMain event.\nThe main event was the men's Royal Rumble match, which saw Raw's WWE Champion Brock Lesnar (accompanied by Paul Heyman) enter at number one. SmackDown's Elias entered second and sang a song during his entrance and taunted Lesnar until Lesnar ran out and chased Elias to the ring, where Lesnar bashed a guitar over Elias' back and quickly eliminated him. Lesnar would make quick work of the next few entrants (Erick Rowan, Robert Roode, and John Morrison), eliminating them almost as soon as they entered the match. SmackDown's Kofi Kingston, whom Lesnar defeated for the WWE Championship back in October, entered sixth followed by Rey Mysterio, who Lesnar recently feuded with, and then Kingston's New Day and SmackDown Tag Team Champion partner Big E. Kingston performed Trouble in Paradise on Lesnar, followed by a Big Ending by Big E and a 619 from Mysterio, but as Mysterio leapt at Lesnar, Lesnar caught him and eliminated him. After Lesnar leapt off of Big E's back to lay out Kingston with a clothesline, Lesnar eliminated Big E. Lesnar then performed an F5 on Kingston to eliminate him. Cesaro came in next, but didn't last long either, falling as yet another score for the Beast Incarnate. After Lesnar had a brief reunion with his old training partner Shelton Benjamin (the tenth entrant) and embracing him, Lesnar eliminated Benjamin after tricking him into thinking they would team up for the rest of the match. Shinsuke Nakamura (the eleventh entrant) suffered the same fate as all before him. The twelfth entrant saw the surprise return of Montel Vontavious Porter (who last wrestled in WWE in 2010), who was quickly eliminated by Lesnar. NXT's Keith Lee (the thirteenth entrant) and SmackDown's Braun Strowman (the fourteenth entrant) managed to subdue Lesnar and momentarily take him down. As Lee and Strowman attempted to eliminate each other, Lesnar managed to eliminate both at the same time, bringing Lesnar's total eliminations to 13, tying him with Strowman for the most eliminations in a single men's Royal Rumble match (a record Strowman set at 2018's Greatest Royal Rumble event).\nRicochet, who had a brief interaction with Lesnar on the previous episode of \"Raw\", entered as the fifteenth entrant, followed by Drew McIntyre as the sixteenth entrant. With Lesnar's attention on McIntyre, Ricochet attacked Lesnar with a low blow from behind and McIntyre performed a Claymore on Lesnar to eliminate him. Following Lesnar's elimination, McIntyre stared him down. McIntyre then eliminated Ricochet and then continued to stare down Lesnar, who was still laid out at ringside, even after eliminating The Miz, until Lesnar left the ring. WWE Hall of Famer Edge, who was forced to retire from wrestling in 2011 due to a neck injury, made a surprise return as the twenty-first entrant. Kevin Owens (the twenty-seventh entrant), Aleister Black (the twenty-eighth entrant), and Samoa Joe (the twenty-ninth entrant) formed a small alliance against the other wrestlers, after which, they fought each other until Seth Rollins (accompanied by Buddy Murphy, Akam, and Rezar) entered last. Joe and Owens left the ring and brawled with the four. Rollins would eliminate Black, Joe, and Owens thanks to interference from Murphy, Akam, and Rezar, who then brawled with Joe, Black, and Owens, which spilled out of the ring. Reigns then performed a Superman Punch on Rollins, followed by a powerslam by Randy Orton (the twenty-fifth entrant) and a Claymore by McIntyre, who then eliminated Rollins. After a brief reunion of Rated-RKO between Edge and Orton, and after Orton teased an RKO on Edge, Edge quickly eliminated Orton. In the climax, after Edge was eliminated by Reigns, Reigns performed a Superman Punch on McIntyre and tried to eliminate him, but McIntyre countered and performed a Claymore on Reigns before eliminating him to win the match and earn himself a world championship match of his choosing at WrestleMania 36.\nAftermath.\nRaw.\nThe following night on \"Raw\", Drew McIntyre announced that he would challenge Brock Lesnar, whom McIntyre eliminated during the men's Royal Rumble match, for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 36. The following week, Ricochet, who aided in Lesnar's elimination, defeated Seth Rollins and Bobby Lashley in a triple threat match to also earn a WWE Championship match against Lesnar, taking place prior to WrestleMania at February's Super ShowDown event. At the event, Lesnar defeated Ricochet in ninety seconds, keeping him as the defending champion heading into his match against McIntyre at WrestleMania.\nAlso on the following \"Raw\", women's Royal Rumble winner Charlotte Flair teased that she would reveal which champion she would challenge at WrestleMania, however, she stated that she was still deciding. The following week, Flair stated she had held both the Raw and SmackDown Women's Championships multiple times and had defeated their current holders, Becky Lynch and Bayley, respectively. She was then interrupted by NXT Women's Champion Rhea Ripley, who stated that Flair should challenge her as Flair had never beat her, but she had beaten Flair. Flair held off on making her decision until after Ripley had defended the title at on February 16. At the event, Ripley retained her title against Bianca Belair, after which, Flair attacked Ripley and Belair and accepted Ripley's WrestleMania challenge, marking the first time that the Royal Rumble winner chose an NXT title, which were previously ineligible.\nEdge made his return to \"Raw\" the following night, stating that he had questioned what if he could wrestle again, and explained that after a second neck surgery and hard work, he was able to make his return at the Royal Rumble and would be able to retire on his own terms. Randy Orton then came out to welcome Edge back and suggested reforming their tag team, Rated-RKO, only to turn on Edge and perform an RKO on him, thus turning heel in the process. Orton then attacked Edge's neck with a steel chair and smashed his head between two steel chairs in a manoeuvre known as the \"Conchairto\", which Edge made famous in the past. A Last Man Standing match between the two was eventually scheduled for Night 2 of WrestleMania 36, which was won by Edge. Orton later challenged Edge to a normal singles match at Backlash, which Orton won. During the match, Edge legitimately tore his triceps. After recovering from his triceps tear, Edge returned at the 2021 Royal Rumble, where he and Orton entered at number one and two, respectively. The two brawled at ringside, and Edge injured Orton's leg, taking Orton out for the majority of the match. Orton returned in the closing moments of the match where he attempted to eliminate Edge, however, Edge countered and eliminated Orton to win the men's Royal Rumble match. Unsatisfied, Orton challenged Edge to a rubber match on the following night's \"Raw\", where thanks to a distraction by Alexa Bliss (as part of a storyline between Orton, Bliss, and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt), Edge defeated Orton, putting an end to their rivalry.\nA United States Championship rematch between Humberto Carrillo and champion Andrade was scheduled for the next night on \"Raw\", where Carrillo won by disqualification due to Zelina Vega's interference. Following the match, Carrillo performed a Hammerlock DDT on Andrade onto the exposed concrete, just as Andrade once did to Carrillo in the past. Andrade was then suspended for 30 days due to violating WWE's wellness policy, though was not stripped of the title. On the March 2 episode of \"Raw\", Carrillo earned another shot at Andrade's U.S. title by pinning him in a tag team match. The match took place at Elimination Chamber, where Andrade retained.\nFollowing the animosity between Lana and Liv Morgan, which caused Lana to eliminate Morgan after she herself was eliminated by Morgan, a match between the two was scheduled the next night on \"Raw\", with Bobby Lashley and Rusev banned from ringside. Morgan would defeat Lana. After defeating Lana in a rematch the next week, Morgan was confronted by former Riott Squad stablemate Ruby Riott, making her return from injury. Riott went to embrace Morgan, after which she then attacked Morgan.\nAfter making a surprise return at the Royal Rumble, Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) faced Rey Mysterio on \"Raw\" in a losing effort. Afterwards, MVP announced that although he still had a few matches left on the independent circuit, his match on \"Raw\" was his final in WWE. This proved to be false, however, as after hosting a segment of the \"VIP Lounge\" in which he insulted men's Royal Rumble winner Drew McIntyre, MVP faced McIntyre in a match on the February 17 episode that McIntyre won. MVP would then become a mainstay on Raw, forming The Hurt Business faction, comprising Bobby Lashley, Shelton Benjamin, and Cedric Alexander.\nSeth Rollins and Buddy Murphy defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Samoa Joe and Kevin Owens. Joe was legitimately injured during the match and was taken backstage, leaving Owens to fend for himself, however, Rollins and Murphy retained the titles after Murphy pinned Owens with a roll-up. On February 7, Buddy Murphy's ring name was shortened to Murphy. Joe's injury proved to be minor, as he returned on the February 10 episode of \"Raw\" to aid Owens and The Viking Raiders (Erik and Ivar) against Rollins' stable.\nOn the February 3 episode of \"Raw\", Asuka challenged Raw Women's Champion Becky Lynch to a rematch, and Lynch accepted for the following week. After Lynch retained the title, she was attacked by NXT's Shayna Baszler. Baszler then went on to win the women's Elimination Chamber match at Elimination Chamber to become the new number one contender for the title at WrestleMania 36.\nSmackDown.\nA six-man tag team rematch from the previous week between the team of Roman Reigns and The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) and the team of King Corbin, Dolph Ziggler, and Robert Roode was scheduled for the following \"SmackDown\" in which the losers ate dog food. Reigns and The Usos won, and they dumped dog food over Corbin. The following week, Corbin challenged Reigns to one more match, and Reigns accepted as a Steel Cage match at Super ShowDown. At the event, Reigns defeated Corbin to end the feud.\nSheamus faced Shorty G in a rematch on the following \"SmackDown\", where Sheamus was again victorious.\nMandy Rose thanked Otis for helping her in the women's Royal Rumble match. With encouragement from his Heavy Machinery tag team partner Tucker, Otis asked Rose out on a date and Rose accepted for Valentine's Day.\nOn the following \"SmackDown\", Bayley addressed her victory over Lacey Evans, as well as Charlotte Flair's Royal Rumble win. She was interrupted by Naomi, who took exception to Bayley's claim that she had beaten everyone as she had never beaten Naomi. Bayley then attacked Naomi, who retaliated and got the upper hand. This marked Naomi's return to the SmackDown brand as prior to her six-month hiatus, she had been drafted to Raw in April 2019's Superstar Shake-up, but went undrafted during the WWE Draft in October. The following week, Naomi participated in a fatal four-way match to determine Bayley's next challenger, but it was won by Carmella. On the February 14 episode, Bayley pinned Carmella while using the ropes for leverage to retain the title. After the match, both Carmella and Naomi attacked Bayley. On the February 21 episode, Naomi defeated Carmella to become the number one contender for Bayley's SmackDown Women's Championship. The match was scheduled for Super ShowDown."

        "title": "2017–18 Minnesota–Duluth Bulldogs men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2017–18 Minnesota–Duluth Bulldogs men's ice hockey team represented the University of Minnesota Duluth in intercollegiate college ice hockey during the 2017–18 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season. The head coach was Scott Sandelin and the team captain was Karson Kuhlman. The team won the 2018 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. The team's leading scorer was Scott Perunovich, who was only the fourth defencemen to lead a championship team in scoring .\nSeason.\nMinnesota–Duluth was coming off a very successful season where they won the NCHC Tournament and finished as the National Runner-up. Unfortunately, the team lost five of its top six scorers in the offseason as well as their starting goaltender, Hunter Miska. Despite the roster turnover, the Bulldogs were ranked No. 6 in the preseason poll and opened their season by hosting the Ice Breaker Tournament. After winning against preseason No. 3 Minnesota Duluth stumbled, going 0–2–2 over its next four games. UMD was still trying to find its starting goaltender and after a 0–0 tie against Bemidji State it looked like Nick Deery had claimed the job but after surrendering 5 goals to the woeful Merrimack Warriors in the very next game Hunter Sheppard got the starting job once more. Sheppard would allow only 3 goals in the next three games (all Bulldog wins) and stake his claim in goal.\nWith the goaltending seemingly settled head coach Scott Sandelin now had to get his team to score. Over a five-week period in November and December, once the Bulldogs began their conference schedule, Minnesota–Duluth never scored more than three goals in a game and were shut out three times. UMD's record dipped below .500 and they were floundering at the bottom of their conference. Just before they went on winter break the Bulldogs exploded for 11 goals in two games against Omaha and, though they lost one of the games when Sheppard had his worst match of the year, the sudden offensive burst game the Bulldogs something to build on.\nJust before the new year Minnesota–Duluth played in the Ledyard Bank Classic and after dropping Yale in the first game they faced host Dartmouth in the title match. Both teams fired over 40 shots at one another but the game ended in a 2–2 tie. A shootout was held to decide the champion (but did not count for official standings due to the NCAA not sanctioning shootouts) and the Bulldogs skated away with the title. Hunter Sheppard was named as the tournament MVP and used the mid-season championship as a springboard to help the team get back into playoff contention. UMD returned to their conference schedule in the second week of January and took two road games against Colorado College before hosting No. 7 North Dakota. The Bulldogs' power play came up big, notching three goals in each contest to help the team sweep the weekend and send UMD into the top ten for the first time since early November.\nThe success was short-lived, however, and Minnesota–Duluth lost four of their next five, including their fifth-straight to Denver. The team was shut out twice more over that stretch but recovered swiftly when they played Miami and Western Michigan, outscoring their opposition 21–1 over those four games. After splitting two games with Omaha Minnesota–Duluth ended the season with a 13–11 record in the NCHC, earning them the No. 3 seed in the conference tournament. UMD met Western Michigan in the quarterfinal and continued their recent dominance over the Broncos by shutting them out in both games to comfortably take the series. The Bulldogs headed to Saint Paul for the final four and promptly lost their fifth game of the year to Denver. The team followed that up with yet another loss in the Third place Game to North Dakota. Despite the disappointing finish Minnesota–Duluth finished 12th in the pairwise rankings, .0001 ahead of Minnesota, and received the final at-large bid in the NCAA tournament.\nThe Bulldogs got the No. 3 seed in the West Regional and were set against Minnesota State for a rubber match. The Mavericks scored twice early and appeared to be cruising to their first tournament win but the Bulldog defense clamped down thereafter, preventing Minnesota State from recording a shot in the second period while slowly chipping away at the lead. UMD tied the game late in the third on the power play and then won the game in overtime on a shot from Parker Mackay. Duluth continued its defensive play in the Regional Final against Air Force, outshooting the airmen 14–0 in the first while taking a 2–0 lead. The Falcons would eventually score late but the UMD would win the match 2–1.\nThe Bulldogs began their second straight frozen four against No. 5 Ohio State and continued their stingy defense. For the second time in as many games UMD scored twice in the first and then played back to halt the Buckeye attack. Ohio State could only manage 20 shots in the game with their lone goal coming in the third period on the power play. With only Notre Dame left in their way, the Bulldogs followed virtually the same script that had won them their previous two games; score twice in the first period then hold on for dear life. This time the opposing power play was able to score in the second period but even the No. 2 overall seed Fighting Irish couldn't manage more than 20 shots in the contest. The two teams played a clean third period and the Bulldogs skated away with their second national title.\nLeading scorer Scott Perunovich won the Tim Taylor Award as the national rookie of the year while Karson Kuhlman was named as the NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "William John Devine (February 22, 1919 – April 27, 1989) was a Canadian ice hockey administrator and radio sports commentator. He worked for CJBQ radio in Belleville, Ontario for 40 years as the sports director. He was involved with the local sports scene, and was president of the Ontario Hockey Association from 1967 to 1969. He moved up to the national level in 1969 becoming vice-president of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) in 1969, and later served as its president from 1973 to 1975.\nDevine was president of the CAHA during a period when the National Hockey League and the World Hockey Association were competing for junior ice hockey players. He spent significant time over two years negotiating the drafting and development agreements with the respective professional leagues. He oversaw the split of Canadian Junior A hockey into Tier 1 and Tier 2, and the subsequent draft system. He helped lay the groundwork for a national midget hockey tournament which later became the Telus Cup. He was involved in planning both the 1974 Summit Series, and the 1975 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships partially hosted in Canada. He was part of the negotiations for Canada returning to play at the Ice Hockey World Championships, and the planning stages of what became the Canada Cup. He later represented Canada at the International Ice Hockey Federation, and was inducted into the Belleville Sports Hall of Fame.\nEarly life.\nWilliam John Devine was born on February 22, 1919, in Toronto, Ontario. He was the son of John James Devine, and later served in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II.\nRadio career and local sports.\nStarting in 1945, he was the sports director at CJBQ radio in Belleville, Ontario, for forty years until 1984. It was the first radio station in Belleville, and Devine was its first employee. He was the sports commentator for the local Belleville McFarlands ice hockey team, and travelled with them to Prague, and broadcast the game in which Belleville won the 1959 Ice Hockey World Championships. On August 20, 1960, Devine broadcast the Harmsworth Cup race for motorboats, won by the Canadian entry \"Miss Supertest III\". He was known for finishing on-air broadcasts by saying, \"to play a sport, you must be one\". Devine later worked with Jack Miller, who would be his replacement at CJBQ.\nDevine also served as a president of the Eastern Ontario branch of Baseball Ontario, and was a commander of the Bay of Quinte Power Boat Squadron. He also served terms as president of the Ontario Sports Writers Association, and the Ontario Sportscasters Association.\nOntario Hockey Association.\nDevine was elected to the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) board of directors in 1959. He served as the OHA president from 1967 to 1969, succeeding Matt Leyden. Devine was in charge of settling the protested 1967 OHA Junior D Championship between the Tweed-Madoc Twins and the Mitchell Hawks. Mitchell protested the eligibility of five players, the lack of a scoreclock, the lack of a washroom in the visiting dressing room, and illegal goal posts. Devine ruled the five players eligible based on residency rules, and was able to get suitable upgrades to the arena to resume the series.\nDevine chaired the OHA committee which considered the application of the Western Ontario Junior B Hockey League to become a Junior A league in June 1968, but declined it due to the lateness of the application, and recommended the group remain as Junior B. The league instead proposed to operate outside of the OHA jurisdiction, and Devine warned the league of possible ramifications. He also urged local Belleville goaltender prodigy Steve Rexe to play for Canada men's national ice hockey team.\nDevine was succeeded by Tubby Schmalz as OHA president in 1972.\nCAHA vice-president.\nDevine was elected the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) vice-president in charge of junior ice hockey on May 23, 1969, at the annual meeting. He served two years in the capacity, being re-elected at the 1970 meeting. During this time he oversaw competition for the Memorial Cup and its scheduling. He also worked on the disagreement between the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) and the CAHA regarding the use of overage players and distribution of development funds from the National Hockey League (NHL), which led the WCHL to leave the CAHA's jurisdiction. He stated the present draft agreement with the NHL expires in 1972, and it sets the upper age limit on junior hockey at 20, whereas the WCHL wanted it to be 21. Devine later said that the CAHA would also reevaluate its junior league classifications at the upcoming general meeting.\nAt the 1970 CAHA general meeting, Devine proposed splitting junior hockey into tiers for better balance, and felt that too many leagues classified themselves as Junior A, just to compete for the Memorial Cup. CAHA delegates initially disagreed over the amount of development money from the NHL, that was allocated to the leagues under Devine's tiered proposal. His proposal was successfully implemented for the 1970–71 season, and including a draft system where Tier 1 Junior A teams were able to draft players from Tier 2 Junior A teams.\nAt the 1971 CAHA general meeting, Devine was elected first vice-president of the CAHA, and served in that role for two years. The WCHL requested to revisit his tiered draft configuration, and wanted an exemption from the restrictions on inter-provincial transfers, since its league operates in three provinces. Devine agreed and proposed the NHL draft payments for players at American colleges, be distributed to the last Canadian club for which the draftee played. He also led the CAHA into more involvement in minor ice hockey and skills development, after seeing the results of the Soviet Union's development system during the 1972 Summit Series.\nCAHA president.\nFirst term.\nDevine succeeded Joe Kryczka as president of the CAHA, at the annual meeting on May 25, 1973. Devine aimed to put the fun back into hockey for children, and felt that hockey parents in Canada put too much emphasis on winning. He and the technical advisory committee of the CAHA shared the same stance against competitive hockey below age ten, and he spoke against parents that attempt to circumvent rules designed for balanced teams and fair play. He also felt that there were too many minor ice hockey organizations that were giving into parents' desires at younger age groups.\nIn 1973, Devine announced that the CAHA sanctioned a new national midget hockey tournament for the top 12 teams in the country, which became known as the Wrigley Cup due to Wrigley Company being the initial sponsor. The 1974 event was scheduled at the Oshawa Civic Auditorium, with the winning team to earn a trip to the Soviet Union, and future events would be rotated around Canada. He also responded to an Alberta government report about junior hockey, and said its recommendation to eliminate player contracts would defeat the purpose of the CAHA, to provide a competitive structure in hockey. If player movements were unrestricted, the balance of power would shift to teams with more money.\nDuring the 1974 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, Devine and Gordon Juckes were approached by Andrey Starovoytov of the Soviet Union, regarding having another Summit Series. On April 29, 1974, Devine represented the CAHA at an agreement for Team Canada to play the Soviet Team in a six-game series, and that Canada would be represented by players from the World Hockey Association (WHA). He became part of the directing committee for the 1974 Summit Series, and later extended it to eight games. Before the games in the Soviet Union, he announced that Team Canada would depart early, and play exhibition games versus Finland, Czechoslovakia, and hopefully Sweden.\nThe remainder of his first year as president was consumed by negotiating development and draft agreements for CAHA players, with the NHL and the WHA. In May 1973, Devine met with the NHL to review details of the current agreement up for renewal on June 30, 1973, and prevent efforts by the WHA to deal independently with the WCHL. The WHA had recently signed junior-age players Mark Howe and Marty Howe, despite two letters from the WHA to Kryczka that the WHA would not do so. The WHA felt that development fees for the CAHA were too high, and took the stance that CAHA players were already professionals since they received a weekly stipend to cover living expenses.\nThe existing agreement with the NHL provides education for players, and development funds for the junior teams. Devine doubted that the NHL would begin drafting players below the age of 20, despite internally discussing whether to renew the existing agreement with the CAHA, in response to the signings supported by WHA president Gary Davidson. Devine cautioned that a bidding war between the NHL and the WHA for junior players, would be detrimental to the amateur hockey system in Canada. Devine and the CAHA met with Davidson and the WHA in Toronto on September 7, 1973, along with Canadian Minister of Health and Welfare Marc Lalonde, and Sport Canada director Lou Lefaive to discuss long-term solutions.\nDevine announced a tentative draft agreement with the WHA on September 8, 1973, but he did not disclose amounts, pending ratification by both bodies. Payments were expected to be retroactive, and a clause was included for exceptional underage players to be drafted. On September 17, 1973, Devine announced that the CAHA and the NHL were close to a new draft agreement, also with a clause inserted to allow drafting players 18 to 20 years old of exceptional status. On March 29, 1974, the CAHA and the WHA signed a one-year draft agreement allowing for one exceptional player per WHA team to be drafted in the first or second round only.\nSecond term.\nDevine was re-elected to a second year as CAHA president by acclamation, on May 24, 1974. The CAHA gained another branch when it approved splitting the Maritime Amateur Hockey Association into the Nova Scotia Hockey Association and the Prince Edward Island Hockey Association. At the same meeting, Devine announced that the CAHA would shift the decision making to each individual province on how to rank its leagues within the pyramid of play, but also expressed reservation that too many leagues might rank themselves at too high of a tier. Also at the 1974 general meeting, he announced that the 1975 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships would be co-hosted in Manitoba and Minnesota. It was decided later that, an all-star team from the WCHL would represent Canada.\nOn June 3, 1974, Devine announced that a meeting among Canada, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Sweden, and the Soviet Union, resulted in an agreement in principle to have open competition in IIHF World Championships, and be within Olympic regulations, which later became the basis for the Canada Cup. It was a welcome development, as he had previously stated it was difficult for Canada to field a competitive international team due to professional leagues controlling too many players. The announcement foreshadowed a potential World Cup of Hockey, and the possibility of Canada's return to international competition. In December that year, the CAHA proposed making its own international council independent of Hockey Canada, because Devine felt that one organization with its subcommittees was more streamlined.\nIn August 1974, the report \"Investigation and Inquiry into Violence in Amateur Hockey\" was made public by René Brunelle, the Ontario Minister of Social and Family Services. The report was commissioned after the Bramalea Blues withdrew from the OHA due to violence in the 1974 playoffs. In response to the report, Devine said that the recommended financial support from the government to better instruct coaches and referees would only be beneficial. The CAHA later followed up on safety recommendations, and endorsed its first brand-name helmet in January 1975.\nIn November 1974, Devine and the CAHA requested a follow-up meeting with the NHL, the WHA, and government officials to find long-term solutions to protect amateur hockey in Canada. Devine had been criticized by Ed Chynoweth of the WCHL, for failing to pressure the NHL and the WHA on the late payment of development money, and threatened to pull the WCHL out of the CAHA. Devine also came under fire from the new WHA president John F. Bassett in February 1975, when Bassett stated that his league will resume signing players 18 years of age and older when the one-year contract expired with the CAHA, until the legal age laws in Canada were changed. The agreement with the NHL regarding drafted players expired in May 1975, and Devine was unable to reach agreement on a renewal. He was succeeded by Don Johnson as president of the CAHA, at the annual meeting on May 22, 1975.\nLater life.\nAfter leaving the presidency of the CAHA, Devine was elected to the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) governing council on July 24, 1975. He served in that position with the IIHF until 1978. During his time with the IIHF, it voted to allow professionals to participate in the Ice Hockey World Championships as of 1977. Devine said there were some issues to resolve before Canada decided to return to international play, such as the time of year which usually coincided with professional ice hockey playoffs.\nIn a 1988 interview about his hockey career, he remarked that \"when it comes to hockey, politicians get on and off bandwagons faster than anybody\".\nDevine died at Belleville General Hospital on April 27, 1989, at age 70. He and his wife Minnie Woodman had two sons and one daughter. He was interred in the Wolfe Island United Church's Point Alexandria Cemetery.\nHonours and awards.\nDevine received the Sports Federation of Canada broadcasting award in 1967. In 1973, he was recognized by Sport Canada for his contributions to amateur sport participation in Canada. He received the OHA Gold Stick award of merit in 1974, and was made a life member of the OHA in 1976. He received the City of Bellevlle Award in 1976. On May 23, 1979, Devine was given life membership in the CAHA.\nDevine received the Canadian Boating Federation award of the decade for the 1970s. He was inducted into the Belleville Sports Hall of Fame in 1988. He was also life member of the Prince Edward Power Boat Racing Club, and an honorary life member of the Metro Toronto Hockey League."

        "title": "Boxing at the 1988 Summer Olympics – Super heavyweight",
        "text": "The men's super heavyweight event was part of the boxing programme at the 1988 Summer Olympics. The weight class allowed boxers of more than 91 kilograms to compete. The competition was held from 22 September to 2 October 1988. 17 boxers from 17 nations competed.\nFuture world heavyweight champion 23-year-old Lennox Lewis of Canada defeated 21-year-old Riddick Bowe of the US in a controversial final.\nBackground.\nThe super heavyweight event of the 1988 Olympics was weakened by the absence of a Cuban boxer. Teófilo Stevenson, a veteran three-time Olympic champion whose first Olympics were back in 1972, did not retire anticipating these Olympics. He announced his retirement shortly after the Cuban government decided to boycott the Games. He was 36 years of age in 1988. In contrast, future finalists Lewis and Bowe were rather young, 23 and 21 years old respectively. Possible Cuban alternate Jorge Luis González, 24, had defeated both Bowe and Lewis at the 1987 Pan American Games.\nIt was predicted that the gold medal would be contested between the North Americans Lennox Lewis and Riddick Bowe and Europeans Ulli Kaden and Alex Miroshnichenko.\nResults.\nThe following boxers took part in the event:\nFinal.\nBowe was the more effective fighter in the first round, landing 33 of 94 punches thrown (34%) while Lewis landed 14 of 67 (21%). In the first round the referee from East Germany gave Bowe two cautions for headbutts and deducted a point for a third headbutt. Commentator Ferdie Pacheco disagreed with the deduction, saying they did not hit heads. In the second round, Lewis landed several hard punches. The referee gave Bowe two standing eight counts and waved the fight off after the second one, even though Bowe seemed able to continue. Pacheco disagreed with the stoppage, calling it \"very strange\", but Marv Albert said Bowe took \"a pounding.\""

The team was coached by Digger Phelps and was ranked in the Associated Press poll for the entirety of the season.\nPreseason.\nThe Irish were ranked fifth in the preseason AP Poll, behind Indiana, Kentucky, Duke and Ohio State. While they lost frontcourt contributors Bruce Flowers and Bill Laimbeer to graduation, they added a recruiting class ranked fourth nationally by the 1979–80 Street &amp; Smith basketball yearbook. The class included McDonald's All-Americans Tim Andree and John Paxson and highly regarded forward Bill Varner. Key returning players were 1979 All-American Kelly Tripucka and future National Basketball Association (NBA) players Tracy Jackson, Bill Hanzlik and Orlando Woolridge. Woolridge was moved from forward to center to replace Flowers and Laimbeer. Senior point guard Rich Branning was selected co-captain of the team with Hanzlik.\nLeading up to an Olympic year, Notre Dame played an exhibition game against the Soviet National Team, notching a surprising 86–76 win behind Tripucka's 35 points.\nRegular season.\nThe Irish suffered an early setback as senior co-captain Hanzlik missed several games with a dislocated finger, but fared well, compiling a 6–0 record in his absence, including a marquee win against UCLA. The Irish won the contest behind clutch free throws and defense from freshman John Paxson. After the team's fast start, The Irish found themselves ranked third in the country and facing second-ranked Kentucky at Freedom Hall in Louisville. Despite the Wildcats missing starters Sam Bowie and Dirk Minniefield, the Irish lost the game 80–86. A January loss to San Francisco left the Irish on a two-game losing streak. The highlight of the Irish's season came on February 27, 1980, when they upset top-ranked DePaul 76–74 in double-overtime. The Irish were led by Kelly Tripucka's 28 points and the win was sealed by two free throws by Orlando Woolridge. The Irish were able to overcome a big scoring push by future NBA All-Stars Mark Aguirre (28 points) and Terry Cummings (16). A regular-season finale 62–54 win at Dayton raised the Irish's record to 22–5.\nNCAA tournament.\nNotre Dame was selected for the 1980 NCAA tournament and were the 4 seed in the Midwest Region, slated to play the winner of a first-round game between Missouri and San Jose State in Lincoln, Nebraska. Fifth-seeded Missouri upset the Irish 87–84 in overtime behind senior Mark Dressler's 32 points, wasting a 29-point effort by Tracy Jackson.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=| NCAA tournament"

        "text": "Joe Allen (November 8, 1947 – May 20, 1997) was an American basketball player who played for Bradley University in the late 1960s. A center, Allen led the Braves in rebounding and scoring each season of varsity basketball. While averaging 10.9 rebounds per game, Allen also averaged 22.2 points per game. During his senior season, Allen would lead the nation in field goal percentage, shooting over 65% from the field (.655).\nCarver High School.\nIn 1962, Allen lead his Carver Military Academy basketball team to a record of 28–5 and a runner-up at the state championships, where his team lost to Stephen Decatur High School. The following season, Allen would again lead the Carver Challengers to the IHSA state title game. The team again finished with a 28–5 record, and this time won the state championship, defeating the Orphans of Centralia. Allen scored 51 points in the 1962 tournament, averaging 12.8 points per game. In the 1963 tournament, Allen scored 67 points while grabbing 40 rebounds in the four tournament games, an average of 16.8 points and 10 rebounds per game with 18 points and 17 rebounds in the title game. In eight tournament games, Allen would make 50 of 85 field goals shooting 59%.\nIn 1974, Allen was inducted into the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association's Hall of Fame as a player.\nIn 2007, the Illinois High School Association named Allen one of the 100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament.\nBradley University.\nAllen enrolled at Bradley University in the fall of 1964, however due to a knee surgery mid-season, he was forced to wear a knee-brace for the rest of his playing time at Bradley. In his sophomore year he was the starting center of the 1965–66 Braves team that finished second in the Missouri Valley with a 20–6 record. As a junior, Allen maintained his starting center role on a team that finished fourth in the conference with an overall record of 17–9. His best year came during the 1967–68 season, when Allen was named team co-captain and the Braves finished their schedule with an overall record of 19–9.\nDuring his three years of varsity basketball, Allen recorded 13 games with 30 or more points, including a high of 45 points versus Southern California on December 9, 1966 at Robertson Fieldhouse. He recorded the first triple-double in Bradley Basketball history with 25 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists against Oklahoma on December 20, 1966, also at Robertson Fieldhouse. Allen was named co-captain of the team prior to the 1967–1968 season and would go onto lead the nation in field goal percentage (.655) during that same year. He is one of seven Bradley Basketball players to have his uniform number retired (#31), and finished his career third on Bradley's all-time scoring list with 1,752 career points and fourth with 865 career rebounds. Allen would return to Bradley to serve as an assistant coach from 1972–1977.\nDuring the 2003 season, Allen was named to the Bradley Basketball Team of the Century."

He played for Western Suburbs and Parramatta in the NSWRL competition.\nPlaying career.\nBaker grew up in Portland, New South Wales but made the move to Sydney and played his first grade match for Western Suburbs in 1968. Baker spent a largely unsuccessful time with Wests as the club finished towards to bottom of the table and claimed a wooden spoon in 1971. In 1974, Baker joined Parramatta with the club finishing second last in his first season there. Parramatta only avoided the wooden spoon because they had a better for and against as opposed to last placed Balmain. In 1975, Parramatta signed former St George legend Norm Provan as coach and the club had a major form reversal qualifying for the finals.\nIn 1976, Parramatta finished second on the table and qualified for the finals. Parramatta went on to defeat St George and Manly in the finals series to qualify for the club's first ever grand final. In the 1976 grand final, Baker was selected to play and was placed on the reserves bench. During the match with 10 minutes left to play, Parramatta passed the ball to the right hand side which ended in the hands of John Moran. Moran passed the ball to winger Neville Glover who dropped the ball over the try line with no Manly player in front of him. The try would have given Parramatta their first premiership victory but Manly held on to win the grand final 13-10.\nThe following year in 1977, Baker was part of the Parramatta side which won its first minor premiership and qualified for its second grand final. Parramatta played against St George in the grand final with Baker starting at second-row. In a tense game, the match ended in a 9-9 draw. The rules at the time meant that both sides would need to attend the following week and play again. In the grand final replay, Baker resumed his position at second-row but Parramatta were outplayed in the match and lost 22-0.\nBaker went on to play for Parramatta in 1978 when they made the finals by finishing 5th and in 1979 when the club finished 2nd but lost to Canterbury in the preliminary finals. Baker retired at the end of the season after playing 12 years of first grade."

He played in the NSWRFL premiership for North Sydney and St George as a prop.\nEarly life.\nNorton was born and raised in North Sydney and played his junior rugby league in the area. Norton then moved to Tamworth in country New South Wales and was selected to play in the country representative side in 1967.\nPlaying career.\nNorton was graded by the club he supported as a child, the North Sydney Bears in 1968. Norton spent three years at Norths but the club struggled on the field finishing near the bottom of the table. In 1971, Norton joined St George but did not feature in the club's finals campaign or grand final loss to Souths that year. In 1972, Norton featured more prominently for St George and played in both the club's finals matches as they made it to the preliminary final before being defeated by Eastern Suburbs. St George then qualified for the finals the following year with Norton featuring in both games against Newtown which ended in defeat. In 1975, Norton re-joined North Sydney and spent one last season at the club as they finished 9th on the table before retiring as a player.\nCoaching career.\nNorton began his coaching career when he replaced Gregory Hawick as coach of North Sydney midway through the 1985 season. At the time of coming in as coach, North Sydney were in danger of finishing last on the table but he guided North Sydney to safety with an 11th-placed finish. Norton is credited with bringing back a fighting spirit to the Norths club and he instilled a motto for the team to follow which was “The real winners are those who lose but keep fighting\".\nIn his first full season as coach, Norton guided Norths to the finals in 1986. At the time, Norths had only managed to qualify for the finals on 2 occasions in the last 20 years before this. Norths went on to lose their elimination final against Balmain played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Despite having a successful season, Norton stood down as coach and was replaced by Frank Stanton for the 1987 season. Even though Norton's tenure at the club was short, his impact on the club changed the culture at Norths and set them on a path over the next decade to go from easy beats to title contenders.\nAfter leaving Norths, Norton went and coached in Darwin before returning to North Sydney and became a board member at the club."

The league was founded in 1946 and dissolved after three seasons in 1949.\nHistory.\nThe league formed in 1946 as an eight-team circuit. The first game was on November 20, 1946 in Albany, New York at the Washington Avenue Armory between the Albany Senators and the Cohoes Mastodons. Albany lost their first two games, which led them to replace their head coach George Duke for Barney Sedran.\nOn December 28, 1947, league commissioner Frank Basloe announced an Oswego–Cohoes game was fortified by the latter team. Cohoes players were stranded in New York City during a snow storm and were unable to make the game on time. The league wrapped its first half season on January 2, 1948. The Mohawk Royals set a league-high for points scored during a game on January 8, 1948 with 112 in victory over the Oswego Pontiacs. On January 21, 1948 the league assembled a New York State Professional Basketball League All-Star team to play the Utica Olympics. Jerry Rizzo joined the NYSPL Saratoga Indians following a suspension from the National Basketball League for a physical altercation with a referee.\nBefore the 1948–49 season the Utica Olympics announced their local fire department would not permit the team to play at the Utica Armory. The fire department eventually accepted plans by the team to admit a limited number of spectators to the venue. The 1949 championship series between the Mohawk Redskins and the Cohoes Mastodons was never completed. Players for both teams failed to report to the first championship game and several players for Mohawk and their coach Bernard Sarachek had signed with American Basketball League teams. League officials vowed to return for the 1949–1950 season, but it eventually disbanded due to high operating costs. The 1948–49 championship was awarded to the Cohoes Mastadons, who had the best regular season record."

The Test series formed part of the inaugural 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship.\nIn August 2019, Cricket South Africa confirmed that Faf du Plessis would lead the Test side for the tour, with Quinton de Kock named captain of the T20I team. Later the same month, as per the request of the Jharkhand Cricket Association, due to Durga Puja celebrations in the second week of October in Ranchi, the Committee of Administrators (CoA) agreed to switch the venues of the second and third Tests. Pune, which was originally scheduled to host the third Test, hosted the second Test, with Ranchi hosting the third Test match.\nThe three-match T20I series was drawn 1–1, after the first fixture was washed out. In the Test series, India won the first two matches to take an unassailable 2–0 lead. It was India's eleventh-consecutive series win at home, setting a new record for any team in Test cricket. India won the final Test by an innings and 202 runs to win the series 3–0. It was India's first whitewash in a bilateral Test series against South Africa. South Africa lost the last two Tests by an innings. The last time they had lost consecutive Test matches by an innings margin was during Australia's visit in 1935–36.\nSouth Africa returned to India in March 2020 to play three One Day International (ODI) matches. On 6 March 2020, Cricket South Africa announced that the trip to India for the ODI matches would still go ahead, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. After the first ODI, which was abandoned with no play due to rain, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) confirmed that the two remaining ODIs would be played behind closed doors, in an attempt to reduce the impact of the coronavirus. However, on 13 March 2020, the remaining two ODI matches were cancelled.\nSquads.\nAhead of the tour, Rudi Second was ruled out of South Africa's Test squad due to injury. He was replaced by Heinrich Klaasen. JJ Smuts was also ruled out of South Africa's T20I squad due to fitness concerns, and was replaced by George Linde. Jasprit Bumrah was ruled out of India's Test squad due to a stress fracture, with Umesh Yadav replacing him. Ahead of the third and final Test, Keshav Maharaj was ruled out of South Africa's squad with a shoulder injury, and was replaced by George Linde. Shahbaz Nadeem was added to India's squad for the third Test, as cover for Kuldeep Yadav. Ahead of the ODI series, Janneman Malan was added to South Africa's squad."

In a change from previous years, all players only play one match each night. Phase 2 matches have been increased to a maximum of fourteen legs, allowing for a 7-7 draw. In previous years, the maximum number of legs was twelve. At the end of Phase 2, the bottom four players in the league table are eliminated from the competition.\nPlay-off Night:\nThe top four players in the league table contest the two knockout semi-finals with 1st playing 4th and 2nd playing 3rd.

This game is different to the game of the same name released in Japan and Taiwan. An upgraded version of this \"Great Baseball\" would later that year be released in Japan as \"The Pro Yakyū: Pennant Race\".\nGameplay.\nIn this game, the player takes on the role of a manager and can field a total of 26 teams to battle for the league championship. The player either starts with offense or defense, playing through 9 innings as in a standard game of baseball. Team 1 goes to bat first and Team 2 goes to bat second. In a single player game, once the team in selected, the computer automatically selects the CPU controlled opponent. In two player games, each player can select their own team, but they have to be from the same league.\nOnce the starting pitcher is selected, the player can choose a specialty ball and stamina level. With more stamina, pitch speed and accuracy last longer. When batting, players are allowed up to four pinch hitters in each game. Pinch hitters are selected for a given inning just before the team goes up to bat. Players can select any player in the field except the catcher.\nReception.\n\"Great Baseball\" received mixed reviews from critics. \"Computer and Video Games\" gave the game a 76 out of 100. Stating in their review that, sound, graphics and animation were all of high quality. The primary flaw of the game was that the nature of baseball made it poorly suited to a video game. \"Baseball doesn't flow particularly well as a game in the same way that soccer does\". Complaints about the common stopping and starting with switches between pitcher, hitter and catchers preventing a full immersion into the game were also made. The review did note that those who like real baseball would be pleased with the game. In a 2011 review, Marc Golding gave the game a score of 3 out of 10. Common complaints about the game include poor visuals and sounds. Other complaints noted difficult or unresponsive controls."

In 1976, Levy signed with Parramatta as the club qualified for the first grand final in its history against Manly. In the grand final itself, Parramatta went into half time level with Manly at 7-7. In the second half and with 10 minutes remaining, Parramatta made a play to the right hand side of the field and the ball eventually reached Neville Glover. With the try line wide open, Glover dropped the ball over the line which would have given Parramatta the match winning try. In the final five minutes Manly held on after a Parramatta onslaught to win the premiership 13-10.\nThe following year, Levy was a member of the Parramatta side which claimed their first ever minor premiership after finishing first during the regular season.

The grand final finished in a 9-9 draw and a replay was rescheduled to determine the winner. In the 1977 replay, Levy shifted to fullback as Peard had returned as Parramatta were defeated 22-0. Levy played with Parramatta up until the end of 1980 until he was told by coach Jack Gibson he was not required for the 1981 season.\nLevy later moved to Penrith and played over 100 games for them and was a member of the 1985 side which qualified for the finals for the first time in the club's history.\nPost playing.\nIn retirement, Levy became an ABC commentator on rugby league matches in the 1980s.

        "title": "Golf Films (Golf Channel)",
        "text": "Golf Films is a franchise of films produced by Golf Channel, which originated in 1995 as the first U.S. single-sport cable network, co-founded by Arnold Palmer.  The biographical features in the Golf Films library cover a wide range of key figures and events that have changed the game in unique ways, in particular over the last century.\nBackground.\nGolf Channel is an American pay television network owned by the NBC Sports Group subsidiary of NBCUniversal division of Comcast. The channel focuses on coverage of the sport of golf, including live coverage of tournaments, as well as news and instructional programming.\nThe Golf Films franchise is a collection of independently produced biographical films that center around key figures and events in the history of golf.    \nEach Golf Films production is typically released at a time that matches its significance and correlation with a current major championship/event.  Recently, “Famous 5” premiered on September 24, 2018, just days before the beginning of the 2018 Ryder Cup in Paris, France, which was aired on NBC and Golf Channel.  “Famous 5” focused on a group of five European golfers – all born within 11 months of one another – who helped revitalize the Ryder Cup and redefine the professional golf landscape.  \nList of Golf Films.\n“Famous 5” outlines how five European golfers – born within 11 months of one another – helped revitalize the Ryder Cup and redefine the professional golf landscape. The film also details how the five (Seve Ballesteros, Nick Faldo, Bernhard Langer, Sandy Lyle, Ian Woosnam) would go on to World Golf Hall of Fame careers, led by 16-combined major championships and a No. 1 world ranking (all but Lyle).\n\"Go Down Swinging: The 1999 Open at Carnoustie\" recounts the 1999 Open when Jean van de Velde surrendered what seemed like inevitable victory with a three-shot lead on the 72nd hole.\n\"Summer of '76\" \n\"Jack\" is a biopic on record 18-time major champion and World Golf Hall of Fame member Jack Nicklaus.\n\"Countdown to Rio\" prepared viewers for golf's return to the Olympic Games in 2016 for the first time in 112 years. The special details the sport's journey back to becoming an Olympic sport, including the reaction from the vote in October 2009 that finalized the sport's reinstatement into the Games. The subsequent elements include the events that would follow ahead of the 2016 Rio Olympics, including: The bidding process for designing the Olympic golf course venue and the challenges that the winning architect – Gil Hanse – would face in preparing the course for competition.\n\"86\" is a commemoration of the 30-year anniversary of Jack Nicklaus’ 30th anniversary historic 18th and final major championship in the 1986 Masters.\n“Ben Crenshaw: A Walk Through Augusta” serves as a retrospective on the life and career of Ben Crenshaw.\n\"Arnie &amp; Me\" consists largely of videos recounting random meetings with Palmer. The stories are told by the fans, with no narration.\nAn Emmy-nominated film commemorating Payne Stewart on the 15th anniversary of his victory in the 1999 U.S. Open.\n\"Arnie\" features interviews with more than 100 people, all weighing in on Palmer's contributions to sports and society.\n\"Lee Trevino: An American Champion\" recounts Lee Trevino’s playoff victory in the 1971 U.S. Open over Jack Nicklaus, featuring retrospective interviews with both World Golf Hall of Fame members. The film details the impoverished childhood of Trevino, a Mexican-American eighth grade dropout.\n\"Go Annika\" commemorates the historic moment when Annika Sorenstam became the first woman in the modern professional golf era to test her mettle amongst the men in the 2003 PGA Tour event at Colonial Country Club. The film details how and why the World Golf Hall of Fame member and best female golfer of her generation came to play in the tournament, revealing the immense pressure she felt and how it changed her outlook on her life and career forever. Longtime golf writer Ron Sirak summed up Annika's foray into men's golf.  “She entered the Bank of America Colonial as a female golfer and left it as a golfer,” Sirak wrote. “She entered it as a reluctant superstar and left it as a one-word celebrity.” (3) \"Go Annika\" also incorporates Sorenstam's return visit to Colonial a decade later, where (to her surprise) she is reunited with her playing partners from 2003 – Aaron Barber and Dean Wilson – for a casual round of golf to reminisce about their experience together inside the ropes.\n\"American Triumvirate\" \n\"Uneven Fairways\" chronicles the story of the African-American golfers.\nTiming of the Premiere Dates.\nThe release date of the productions often coincided with major golf events that were contested at the same time.  Some dates relate to other newsworthy events at a particular time. Below is the list of premiere dates and their significance."

        "text": "Mary L. Burke (born c. 1965) is an American basketball coach who served as the head women's basketball coach at Bryant University. She held the position from 1991 until stepping down in 2023. Prior to coaching at Bryant, she served as an assistant coach for four years under Ralph Tomasso at Bryant.\nPlaying career.\nWhile attending Toll Gate High School in Warwick, Rhode Island in the early 1980s, Burke played both volleyball and basketball. She earned All-State recognition in both sports, three times in basketball and twice in volleyball. She was named Rhode Island's Schoolgirl Athlete of the Year in 1983.\nWhile enrolled at Providence College, Burke helped lead the 1985–86 Friars to the Big East Championship Game and a bid in the NCAA tournament and also secure her team's entry into the 1986–87 NWIT. She was named a District I All-American as a senior. In 1987, she was named Rhode Island's Female Athlete of the Year.\nCoaching career.\nBurke took an assistant coaching job with Bryant University after graduating college in 1987. She was promoted to head coach on August 1, 1991, becoming only the fourth women's head basketball coach in Bulldogs history.\nIn the 2003–04 season, the Bulldogs finished the year ranked in the top 25 of the \"USA Today\" Division II Coaches Poll and advanced to the NCAA DII regional final, where they lost.\nBurke's Bulldogs in the 2007–08 season were picked to finish ninth in the preseason coaches' poll. They went on to defeat three nationally ranked teams en route to a sixth-place conference finish and seventh-seed NCAA DII Regional Tournament ranking. It was Bryant's seventh NCAA tourney appearance and the team's last season in Division II.\nIn 2012–13, Burke helped her Bulldogs to their first-ever trip to the Northeast Conference tournament. Bryant won eight of its final 13 games to clinch the eighth and final spot. Burke also earned her 300th career victory on January 26, 2013.\nThe following season, the Bulldogs, coached by Burke, reached the NEC Tourney semifinals and earned a berth to the Women's Basketball Invitational.\nIn 2014–15, Burke led the Bulldogs to their best Division I season to date in which they earned a share of the NEC regular-season title. The first conference championship of her career, Burke had a record-setting season featuring a tie for the most wins in program history (22), most NEC wins in a season (14), and the highest finish in the NEC standings (tied for first). Again, the Bulldogs advanced to the NEC Tourney semifinals.\nBurke took her Bulldogs back to the NEC Tourney in the 2015–16 season, notching 14–4 conference mark, including a 10–0 start in league play, and becoming one of only seven teams to reach the 10–0 tally in NEC history (29 years). Burke recorded 10-plus conference wins in 14 seasons, including eight-straight years with double-digit league victories (2000–08). The Bulldogs advanced for the third-straight year to the league semifinals.\nIn 2016–17, Burke led the Bulldogs to their best-ever NEC finish, reaching the conference finals, after earning the No. 4 seed in the league tournament."

        "title": "1956–57 Colorado College Tigers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1956–57 Colorado College Tigers men's ice hockey team represented Colorado College in college ice hockey. In its 2nd year under head coach Tom Bedecki, the team compiled a 25–5–0 record, outscored opponents 205 to 106, and won the 1957 NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. The Tigers defeated Michigan 13–6 in the championship game at the Broadmoor World Arena in Colorado Springs, Colorado. CC tied the record for the most goals scored in a championship game (1950) and combined with the Wolverines for the most total goals in a title game (19). As of 2018 this is the last time Colorado College has won the national title in ice hockey.\nSeason.\nAfter appearing in the first five national tournaments Colorado College had made the championship once in the next four years. CC's fortunes turned the year before when Bill Hay, a standout junior player from Saskatchewan hitchhiked down to Colorado Springs and was able to talk both himself and his fried Bob McCusker into athletic scholarships. Both players made their varsity debut in 1956–57, as did much of the team, and the Tigers quickly jumped to the top of the standings. After opening the regular season against two junior teams from Canada, CC welcomed four different collegiate opponents into their building and won every single game.\nWith the Tigers sporting a 12-0 record they hit the road for the first time but didn't have to leave the state when they travelled to Denver to face the Pioneers. Colorado College's perfect record was spoiled with a 3–6 defeat but the returned the favor the next night at home, beating their in-state rival 8–7 in overtime. The Tigers hosted another pair of Canadian junior teams before heading north to face an improving Fighting Sioux team and lost both matches. Two days later CC finally won its first road game of the season, beating Minnesota twice before returning to Colorado to take the second home-and-home series against Denver. After redeeming themselves against North Dakota in two home wins the Tigers split a road series with Michigan Tech to close out their season.\nDespite CC's struggles on the road the team was able to win the WIHL title handily and, with a superb 19–1 home record, post the best season in team history (As of 2018). Colorado College was led back to the NCAA tournament by Hay and McCusker who finished first (tied) and third in scoring in the nation. Both players earned their way onto one of the two All-American Teams as did team captain Don Wishart and all three players were first-team All-WIHL.\nBefitting the western champion, Colorado College was selected as the #1 seed in the west and opened the tournament against Clarkson who had compiled an undefeated season the year before and followed that up with a stellar 18–2 mark. Despite the two teams' success the Golden Knights were completely outmatched by older and larger CC team. While the final score was relatively close, 5–3 with a hat-trick from Bob McCusker, the Tigers nearly tripled the number of shots from Clarkson (60–21) and the Green and Gold couldn't score enough to reward the valiant effort from the goaltender Eddie MacDonald.\nIn the title tilt CC found itself pitted against two-time defending champion Michigan who had won five of the six national titles since CC earned its first championship in 1950. The Wolverines had utterly dominated the series between the two teams over the previous decade and won all three games the pair played in the NCAA Tournament despite every game being played at the Broadmoor World Arena. None of those losses, however, had come with Hay and McCusker on the team and the two sophomores combined to score the first three goals of the contest. Showing the championship mettle, Michigan responded with three of their own before the first period was over and erased the CC advantage. CC goalie Bob Southwood settled down in the second period and when the Tigers scored three more times the Wolverines could only muster one in response. Even with a two-goal lead the Tigers didn't pull back in the third and after McCusker opened the scoring with his third of the game the rest of the team followed suit and score five more times before Michigan got its fifth but by then it was far too late and the Tigers eventually cruised to a 13–6 victory, winning their second National Title.\nBob McCusker tied the NCAA records for goals (4) and points (6) in a championship game and was the logical choice for Most Outstanding Player. McCusker was accompanied by Bill Hay and Don Wishart on the All-Tournament First Team while Dick McGhee and John Andrews made the Second Team.\nSchedule.\nConference games against Michigan State, Michigan Tech and Minnesota were only worth 1 point in the standings.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "title": "2019 Giro d'Italia",
        "text": "The 2019 Giro d'Italia was a three-week Grand Tour cycling stage race organised by RCS Sport that took place mainly in Italy, between 11 May and 2 June 2019. The race was the 102nd edition of the Giro d'Italia and was the first Grand Tour of the 2019 cycling season. The race started with an individual time trial in Bologna, and finished with another time-trial in Verona. The race was won by Richard Carapaz (), who became the first Ecuadorian rider to win the Giro d'Italia. Italian Vincenzo Nibali () finished 2nd, with Slovenian rider Primož Roglič () in 3rd place. Carapaz also became the second South American rider to win the Giro, after Nairo Quintana in 2014. \nPascal Ackermann () narrowly won the points classification before Arnaud Démare (), with Damiano Cima () in third place. Giulio Ciccone () won mountains classification after leading it through 20 of the race's 21 stages, and Miguel Ángel López () won the young rider classification. The team classification was won by .\nTeams.\nAll 18 UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited and were obliged to attend the race. Four wildcard UCI Professional Continental teams were also selected. Because of an agreement between RCS Sport and the organisers of the Coppa Italia di ciclismo (the Italian Road Cycling Cup) one of the four wildcards is traditionally reserved for the overall cup winner. One of the wildcards was therefore awarded to . On 25 January 2019, the race organisers announced that the other three wildcards were awarded to , and . All of the wildcard teams had previously participated in the Giro, and three out of the four teams participated in the previous year. The one exception was Nippo–Vini Fantini, whose last participation in the Giro was in 2016. Each team started with eight riders. The on-stage presentation of the teams took place in Bologna on 9 May, two days before the opening stage.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nTwo previous Giro d'Italia champions, Vincenzo Nibali () and Tom Dumoulin (), are considered to be among the favorites for the Maglia Rosa, together with Miguel Ángel López (), Mikel Landa (), Primož Roglič () and Simon Yates ().\nOther riders believed to be competitive in the general classification were Richard Carapaz (), Esteban Chaves (), Davide Formolo (), Ion Izagirre (), Bob Jungels (), Rafał Majka (), Bauke Mollema (), Ben O'Connor () and Ilnur Zakarin ().\nRiders believed to be the main contenders for victories on the sprint stages are the current German national champion Pascal Ackermann (), Frenchman Arnaud Démare (), Australian rider Caleb Ewan (), Colombia's Fernando Gaviria (), and the defending winner of the points classification, Italian Elia Viviani ().\nRoute and stages.\nThe race started on 11 May with an 8 km \"cronoscalata\", a mountain time trial, in Bologna, which concluded with a climb to the Sanctuary of the Madonna di San Luca. The steep (average gradient 9.7%) climb, which is regularly used as a finish in the Italian autumn classic Giro dell'Emilia, made its debut in the Giro in 1956 in a time trial stage won by Charly Gaul, and had now made its fourth appearance in the Giro. The race then headed south, with the second stage crossing the Apennines into Tuscany, honouring Tuscan cyclist Gino Bartali with a stage finish in Fucecchio. The following stage started in Vinci, celebrating the 500th anniversary of the death of Leonardo da Vinci, and finished in Orbetello, which also acted as the start location for the following stage, in which the race left Tuscany for the Lazio region with a stage finish in Frascati. Continuing south, the peloton then left Frascati for a stage finish in Terracina, and, following a short transfer to Cassino, crossed the country on a hilly stage to the Apulian region on eastern coast, finishing in the town of San Giovanni Rotondo. The race then headed north, with stage finishes in L'Aquila and Pesaro. Stage nine's individual time trial in San Marino was the last stage before the rest day, and the only occasion where the Giro left Italy.\nFollowing the first rest day, the riders tackled two flat stages with finishes in Modena and Novi Ligure. The twelfth stage, relatively short at , started from Cuneo and included the climb of , 1248 meters above sea level. It finished with a very short, but steep climb in the town of Pinerolo, with the gradient reaching 20%. The thirteenth stage has been considered to become the first big test for the riders aiming for the general classification and included the race's first summit finish, at Lago Serrù, close to Ceresole Reale. Two other categorized climbs were included in the stage, namely the Colle del Lys and the Pian del Lupo.\nFollowing the second, and last, rest day on 27 May, the riders faced what has been dubbed as the queen stage of the race, which started in Lovere, included several categorized climbs, including the Passo del Mortirolo, before finishing in Ponte di Legno. Initially, the stage was meant to also feature the Passo di Gavia, previously featured in 2014, in a stage won by Nairo Quintana (), who later won the overall classification, however the climb was ultimately removed from the route two days before the stage was run due to snow and poor weather conditions. The Mortirolo was first included in the race in 1990, and has since then made many appearances in the race, most recently on the 16th stage at the 2017 won by Vincenzo Nibali. The race finished with a time trial in Verona.\nRace overview.\nThe first stage, an 8 km mountain time trial in Bologna, was won by Primož Roglič () who therefore became the first wearer of the \"maglia rosa\", the pink jersey identifying the leader of the general classification. Roglič also took the lead in the points classification. Giulio Ciccone () took the lead in the mountains classification and became the first wearer of the blue jersey, while Miguel Ángel López () finished as the fastest young rider and became the leader of the young rider classification. Stage 2, the first bunch sprint stage, was taken by Pascal Ackermann (), who benefited from a mistake by Elia Viviani () in the setup for the sprint. Roglič held the maglia rosa for another day, while Ackermann took the points classification. Ciccone also went into the breakaway and maintained his lead in the mountains classification. The third stage was once again a group sprint, but this one had much more controversy. In the leadup to the sprint, Viviani pulled out of line and bumped Matteo Moschetti () out of the way. Viviani won the stage on the road, but judges later relegated him for an illegal sprint, which handed the win and points classification to Fernando Gaviria (). No other changes in the jerseys occurred. Richard Carapaz () won the fourth stage after a late attack. Multiple crashes with only a few kilometers left of the stage saw several riders go down. One of those affected was favorite Tom Dumoulin (), who eventually finished the stage four minutes after many other favorites had crossed the line. Roglič extended his general classification lead out to 35 seconds, and Ackermann took back the points classification. Stage five was a drenched one, with a neutralized bunch sprint at the end. Ackermann took the win after nearly colliding with a rider. Gaviria took a close second. Dumoulin officially withdrew after only a few kilometers of the stage, stating that the pain was too much to continue.\nThe first shakeup of the race occurred on stage six, where the breakaway took the stage. Fausto Masnada () beat Valerio Conti () to the line, beating the peloton by a full seven minutes. Conti was handed over the \"maglia rosa\" with the rest of the breakaway riders between him and Roglič because of this. Giovanni Carboni () gained the young rider classification also. Stage seven was another day for the breakaway, this time Pello Bilbao () fending off Tony Gallopin () for the victory. Stage eight saw Caleb Ewan () take the sprint over Elia Viviani and Pascal Ackermann, the holder of the \"maglia ciclamino\" at the time. Stage nine, the San Marino time trial that would round out the first week, saw Primož Roglič victorious again, this time only 11 seconds over Victor Campenaerts () and a full minute over Bauke Mollema () and the rest of the GC favorites. Conti still held the \"maglia rosa.\"\nA slight controversy opened up the second week, with stage ten ending in a reduced sprint caused by the fall of the \"maglia ciclamino\" holder Ackermann. Arnaud Démare () found victory over Viviani and Rüdiger Selig (), who sprinted after Ackermann's crash. Ackermann would finish, although losing the ciclamino to Demare, and Matteo Moschetti would withdraw from injuries sustained in the incident. Ewan found victory once again in stage eleven, where he once again beat Demare and Ackermann. Ewan and Viviani both announced their withdrawals afterwards, in preparation for the Tour de France. Stage twelve followed the common roads of the Giro di Lombardia, where Cesare Benedetti () of the breakaway took his first pro win over Damiano Caruso () and Eddie Dunbar (). It also saw Jan Polanc () taking over the general classification from his teammate Conti. The thirteenth stage was the first true mountain stage of the Giro, and was potentially the turning point. Ilnur Zakarin () took victory after an attack, in which he caught up and surpassed second placed Mikel Nieve (), with Mikel Landa () coming in third. The surprise of the day was Richard Carapaz, who essentially was let go by Vincenzo Nibali () and Roglič. This placed him right with the other favorites, two down on Roglič and a further two on Polanc. However, on the other end of the spectrum, big names like Miguel Ángel López () and Simon Yates () lose multiple minutes on the day. Stage fourteen was arguably the \"maglia rosa\"-deciding stage, as Carapaz was once again on the attack for minutes. The rest of the favorites once again let him go, and let his gap grow to nearly two minutes for a decisive victory. Yates placed in second, gaining about 20 seconds on the rest of the favorites. The fifteenth day of racing was one for the break again, as Dario Cataldo () edged out Mattia Cattaneo () for the win, with Yates once again placing on the podium. This stage saw Roglic lose a bit of time on his rivals after a nightmare day filled with crashes and such, obtaining a needed break from the final rest day.\nThe third week began with the now-shortened \"queen stage\" of the race. Missing out on the Gavia Pass, the challenging day saw the \"maglia azzurra\" (mountain classification) leader Giulio Ciccone () not only secure the classification, but win the stage from a tough breakaway with Jan Hirt () in a close second. Fausto Masnada () grabbed his second podium of the race in third, and saw Lopez lose some 20 seconds on Nibali, as well as Roglič over a minute. The seventeenth day was another one for the break, this time Nans Peters () breaking through for the win, with Esteban Chaves () around a minute and a half back, and Davide Formolo () rounded out in third. Nibali, Roglič, and others once again lost seconds on Carapaz. Stage eighteen, however, was more or less a break in the action for many. Damiano Cima () outlasted the sprint trains to take a surprise win over Ackermann and Simone Consonni (). Demare held the points classification up to this point, but bad positioning meant he brought it home in eighth, putting Ackermann in the \"maglia ciclamino\" to the end of the race. Stage nineteen was yet another for the break, this time Chaves finally nabbing a stage win for himself and Mitchelton–Scott. Andrea Vendrame () and Amaro Antunes () made up the top three, with Lopez gaining around 45 seconds on his rivals. The penultimate stage of the Giro was maybe one of the more exciting ones, with Pello Bilbao () taking another one for himself over Landa, with Ciccone not far behind in third. Roglič and Yates both lost 50 seconds to the favorites, and Lopez once again lost 2 minutes on them. That left everything on the table for the final time trial to round out this year's edition. The American Chad Haga () surprisingly gave Sunweb their one and only win in the Giro, with Campernaerts once again only four seconds down, and with Thomas De Gendt () taking the final place on the podium, rounding out an excellent Giro.\nCarapaz became the first Ecuadorian rider to win a Grand Tour and the second South American rider to win the Giro, after Colombian Nairo Quintana in 2014. Vincenzo Nibali placed second, one minute down, and Roglič managed to take third back from Landa on the final day by eight seconds. Pascal Ackermann took the points classification by 13 points over Arnaud Démare, and Giulio Ciccone outright dominated the mountain classification. Miguel Ángel López unsurprisingly took the youth classification over Pavel Sivakov, and Movistar unsurprisingly took the team classification.\nIncidents.\nAbout from the finish of stage 18, a spectator walked onto the road shortly before the escape group reached the spot and dropped a bicycle in the path of the riders. The man then walked away from the scene. Another spectator stepped in and removed the obstacle. On 4 June 2019, it was reported that the identified perpetrator, a man from Tunisia, faced expulsion back to his home country due to his actions.\nDuring the final ascent to Croce d'Aune on stage 20, Miguel Ángel López was knocked off his bike in an incident with a spectator. Before he got back on his bike, López hit the fan several times in anger. He would go on to lose almost two minutes on the group of other favourites at the end of the stage. Even though UCI regulations stipulate that a rider who engages in physical violence is to be disqualified from the event, López was given no punishment for his action. The UCI announced on 2 June 2019 that they had launched an investigation into the jury's decision not to apply a penalty.\nDoping.\nOn 15 May 2019, the UCI announced that they had provisionally suspended Kristijan Koren (), part of his squad for the 2019 Giro, for his alleged involvement in the \"Operation Aderlass\" doping case. The team subsequently pulled Koren out of the race.\nClassification leadership.\nIn the Giro d'Italia, four different jerseys are awarded. The first and most important is the general classification, calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. Riders receive time bonuses (10, 6 and 4 seconds respectively) for finishing in the first three places on each stage. Smaller time bonuses are also given to the top three riders at the last intermediate sprint on each stage (3, 2 and 1 seconds respectively). The rider with the lowest cumulative time is awarded the pink jersey (), and is considered the winner of the Giro d'Italia.\nAdditionally, there is a points classification. Riders win points for finishing in the top placings on each stage or by being within the first cyclists to reach intermediate sprint locations along each mass-start stage. Flat stages award more points than mountainous stages, meaning that this classification tends to favour sprinters. The leader of the points classification wore the cyclamen jersey.\nThere is also a mountains classification, for which points were awarded for reaching the top of a climb before other riders. Each climb was categorised as either first, second, third or fourth-category, with more points available for the more difficult, higher-categorised climbs. For first-category climbs, the top eight riders earned points; on second-category climbs, six riders won points; on third-category climbs, only the top four riders earned points with three on fourth-category climbs. The leadership of the mountains classification was marked by a blue jersey. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awards more points than the other first-category climbs, with nine riders scoring points. Initially, the Cima Coppi was scheduled to be the Passo di Gavia on the sixteenth stage, but due to weather the climb was removed from the itinerary. The next highest climb was that to Serrù Lake, however the climb had already been ascended prior to the cancellation. As a result, organisers chose to assign the Cima Coppi to the highest climb out of those which had not been ascended – the Passo Manghen on stage 20.\nThe fourth jersey represents the young rider classification. This is decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1994 are eligible. The winner of the classification is awarded a white jersey. There are also two classifications for teams. In the Trofeo Fast Team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage are added up; the leading team is one with the lowest total time. The Trofeo Super Team is a team points classification, with the top 20 riders of each stage earning points for their team.\nThe first additional award is the intermediate sprint classification. Each road stage has two sprints – the \"Traguardi Volanti\". The first 5 riders across the intermediate sprint lines are awarded points (10, 6, 3, 2 and 1 points respectively); the rider with the most points at the end of the race wins the classification. Another classification – the combativity prize () – involves points awarded to the first riders at the stage finishes, at intermediate sprints, and at the summits of categorised climbs. There is also a breakaway award (). For this, points are awarded to each rider in any breakaway smaller than 10 riders that escapes for at least . Each rider is awarded a point for each kilometre that the rider was away from the peloton. The rider with the most points at the end of the Giro wins the award. The final classification is a \"fair play\" ranking for each team. Teams are given penalty points for infringing various rules. These range from half-point penalties, for offences that merit warnings from race officials, to a 2000-point penalty, for a positive doping test. The team that has the lowest points total at the end of the Giro wins the classification. When several teams are tied on points, the team with the highest classified rider in the general classification will be the higher ranked team in the fair play classification."

        "text": "The 2020 Vuelta a España was the 75th edition of the Vuelta a España, one of cycling's three grand tours. It was won for the second consecutive year by Primož Roglič of .\nThe race was originally scheduled to be held from 14 August to 6 September 2020. In April 2020, the 2020 Tour de France was rescheduled to run between the 29 August and 20 September, having been postponed in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. On 15 April, UCI announced that both the Giro d'Italia and the Vuelta would take place in autumn after the 2020 UCI Road World Championships. On 5 May, UCI announced that the postponed Giro and the Vuelta would run between 3 and 25 October and between 20 October and 8 November, respectively. \nFor the first time since 1985, the race was not 21 stages long; instead, it was held in a reduced format over 18 stages.\nIt was also among the closest Vueltas in history with the winning margin being only +0:24. The 2011 Vuelta a España was initially closer than the 2020 edition, but due to a doping incident the margins of victory changed. As such the 2020 Vuelta had the smallest margin of victory since the 1984 Vuelta a España, which was the smallest margin of victory of any grand tour in cycling history.\nTeams.\nTwenty-two teams made up the field that participated in the 2020 Vuelta a España. All nineteen UCI WorldTeams were entitled, and obliged, to enter the race. Additionally, three second-tier UCI ProTeams were invited to participate in the event. The teams were announced on 8 May 2020.\nThe teams participating in the race were:\nUCI WorldTeams\nUCI ProTeams\nPre-race favourites.\nDefending champion Primož Roglič () was considered the pre-race favourite, followed by his teammate and 2017 Giro d'Italia champion Tom Dumoulin. Richard Carapaz (), winner of the 2019 Giro d'Italia, was seen as one of their main challengers, alongside Enric Mas () and Thibaut Pinot (). Aleksandr Vlasov () was also seen as a top contender, having unexpectedly abandoned the Giro d'Italia during the second stage. Other riders considered as contenders included two time former champion Chris Froome (), his teammate Iván Sosa, 2009 champion Alejandro Valverde () and 's Sepp Kuss.\nRiders believed to be the main contenders for victories on the sprint stages were Pascal Ackermann (), Sam Bennett () and Jasper Philipsen ().\nRoute and stages.\nThe full route of the 2020 Vuelta a España was announced on Tuesday 17 December 2019 in Madrid. The first three stages of the 2020 Vuelta were originally due to be held in the Netherlands, starting in Utrecht. This was due to be the fourth time the Vuelta has started outside Spain and the second start in the Netherlands, following the 2009 Vuelta a España. In hosting the start of the race, Utrecht was to become the first city to host stages of all three grand tours. However, on 29 April 2020, the organisers announced that the opening three stages in the Netherlands were cancelled, before confirming later that same day that the race would be shortened to 18 stages and, except for the cancelled stages, follow the exact same route as announced previously. As a result, for the first time since 1961, the race departed from the Basque Country.\nClassification leadership.\nThe Vuelta a España has four individual classifications, for which jerseys were awarded daily to the leading rider, as well as a team competition. The primary classification is the general classification, which is calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses will be awarded at the end of every stage apart from the individual time trial (stage 13). The rider with the lowest cumulative time is the leader of the general classification, and wears the red jersey. The leader of the general classification at the end of the race is considered the overall winner of the Vuelta a España.\nThe second classification is the points classification. Riders receive points for finishing among the highest placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stages. The points available for each stage finish are the same regardless of the stage's type, unlike in the Tour de France and Giro d'Italia, in which wins in flat stages are worth up to 2.5 times more points than wins in mountain stages. As a result the winner of this classification is often also a contender for the overall win. The leader is identified by a green jersey.\nThe next classification is the mountains classification. Points are awarded to the riders that reach the summit of the most difficult climbs first. The climbs are categorized, in order of increasing difficulty, third-, second-, and first- and special-category. The leader wears a white jersey with blue polka dots.\nThe last of the individual classifications is the young rider classification, which is calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage for each rider born on or after 1 January 1995. The rider with the lowest cumulative time is the leader of the young rider classification, and wears the white jersey.\nThere is also the team classification. After each stage, the times of the three highest finishers of each team are added together, and all the members of the leading team wear a red number bib on the following stage. The victory is awarded to the team with the lowest cumulative time at the end of the event.\nIn addition, there is one individual award: the combativity award. This award is given after each stage (excluding the individual time trial) to the rider \"who displayed the most generous effort and best sporting spirit.\" The daily winner wears a yellow number bib the following stage. At the end of the Vuelta, a jury decides the top three riders for the “Most Combative Rider of\nLa Vuelta”, with a public vote deciding the victor."

Riskiyev had defeated Spinks at a match in Tashkent early in 1976, but in the final, Spinks landed a telling body blow in round three, and the referee had to stop the contest, giving Spinks, just 19 years of age, the gold medal.\nSpinks, whose brother, Leon, won the light-heavyweight gold medal in Montreal, turned professional. In 1981 he won the WBA light-heavyweight world title by defeating Eddie Mustafa Muhammad. Michael Spinks would hold a version of the light-heavyweight title through 1985 when he moved up to the heavies and defeated Larry Holmes to win the IBF heavyweight crown, the first light-heavyweight champion to move on to become heavyweight world champ. Spinks fought through 1988, winning his first 31 fights, but he retired after losing a heavyweight title fight that year to Mike Tyson.\nRiskiyev, who was 27 at the time of the 1976 Olympics, stayed in the amateurs, as the Soviet system did not allow any athletes to turn pro, though he didn’t achieve further success."

After three multiple cars crash in the last 20 laps (including the Big One on lap 191 which involved 21 cars), only 19 of the 40 cars were running at the end of the race and only 14 completed every lap. It was the first race of the 2019 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series season, and also marked the debut of the Ford Mustang, which Ford brought in as a replacement for the Fusion. This race was the final career start for Casey Mears. 2016 winner Denny Hamlin held off teammate Kyle Busch over the final laps to win his second Daytona 500 in four years.\nThis Daytona 500 was the first not to feature the Earnhardt name in the starting lineup since 1978.\nReport.\nDaytona International Speedway is a race track in Daytona Beach, Florida, that is one of two superspeedways, the other being Talladega Superspeedway.\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is one of two superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the other being Talladega Superspeedway. The standard track at Daytona International Speedway is a four-turn superspeedway that is long. The track's turns are banked at 31 degrees, while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, is banked at 18 degrees.\nPractice.\nFirst practice (February 9).\nMartin Truex Jr. was the fastest in the first practice session with a time of 45.937 seconds and a speed of .\nSecond practice (February 9).\nDarrell Wallace Jr. was the fastest in the second practice session with a time of 46.149 seconds and a speed of .\nQualifying.\nWilliam Byron scored the pole for the race with a time of 46.319 and a speed of .\nGander RV Duel.\nThe Gander RV Duels are a pair of NASCAR Monster Energy Cup Series races held in conjunction with the Daytona 500 annually in February at Daytona International Speedway. They consist of two races 60 laps and 150 miles (240 km) in length, which serve as heat races that set the lineup for the Daytona 500. The first race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in odd-numbered positions on pole qualifying day, while the second race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in even-numbered positions. The Duels set the lineup for positions 3–38, while positions 39 and 40 are filled by the two \"Open\" (teams without a charter) cars that set the fastest times in qualifying, but did not lock in a spot in the Duels.\nFor championship purposes, each Duel is a full Championship Stage, except there is no playoff point awarded.

J. Watt each had duties before the race. Watt, the race’s grand marshal, became the first NFL player to give “drivers, start your engines” in race history. Edelman was the race’s honorary starter – something several current and former NFL players have done in year’s past – as Edelman waved the green flag to signal the start of the 500. “I think these guys are absolutely insane,” Edelman, the MVP at Super Bowl LIII earlier that month, said before the race. “First and foremost, they’re going 200 miles an hour around for three hours straight and (are) able to focus in extreme conditions.”\nStage 1.\nPole sitter William Byron led the first lap of the race. On lap 3, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. battled Byron for the lead and was able to get infront of him by lap 5. On lap 7, Matt DiBenedetto battled Stenhouse for the lead and was able to get infront of him on lap 11. On lap 21, the first caution flew when Corey LaJoie's right front tire blew and had laid debris on the racetrack. Some drivers pitted during the green flag run including Ricky Stenhouse Jr. and Stenhouse led the field to the restart on lap 25. On lap 35, Kyle Busch took the lead. On lap 50, the second caution flew for it being the first multi car wreck of the race in turn 2. It started when Kurt Busch cut across the nose of Ricky Stenhouse Jr. and Busch spun. Drivers started to check up but Bubba Wallace spun after getting bumped from behind by Tyler Reddick and it sent Wallace into Kurt Busch and the two spun. The wreck also collected Austin Dillon and Jamie McMurray. The race would restart on lap 54. Kyle Busch held onto the lead and Busch won stage 1 earning himself 10 playoff points.\nStage 2.\nSome drivers pitted while others stayed out including Joey Logano and Logano led the field to the restart on lap 66. On the restart, Daniel Suárez took the lead but was immeadietly passed by Logano. On lap 73, Logano pitted which gave the lead to Daniel Hemric. On lap 74, Matt DiBenedetto took the lead from Hemric. DiBenedetto had recently joined Leavine Family Racing whom had formed a technical alliance with Joe Gibbs Racing and it began to show as DiBenedetto held onto the lead until the next caution. On lap 107, the fourth caution would fly when Casey Mears and Parker Kligerman crashed in turn 1. Ryan Blaney was the new leader and Blaney led the field to the restart on lap 112. Blaney would hold off the pack and Blaney would win stage 2 giving himself 10 playoff points.\nFinal stage.\nWilliam Byron was the new leader and Byron led the field to the restart on lap 126. On the restart, Aric Almirola took the lead but was immeadietly passed by Byron. Almirola attempted to take the lead on lap 127 but failed to get infront of Byron. With 44 laps to go, green flag pitstops began. With 42 to go, the 6th caution would fly for the second multi car crash of the race that occurred on pit road. Drivers began to slow down to make their way down to pit road which caused some cars to check up. B. J. McLeod went to go to pit road but got hooked in the right rear by his teammate at Rick Ware racing in Cody Ware and both McLeod and Ware went spinning towards the entrance of pit road. Ware spun into Tyler Reddick which caused Reddick to spin and ramp over the left rear of Jimmie Johnson's car giving both of them damage before Ware spun into Ricky Stenhouse Jr. which caused Stenhouse to turn left into Reddick and sent Stenhouse spinning. Kyle Busch won the race off of pit road but Jamie McMurray did not pit and McMurray led the field to the restart with 33 laps to go. On the restart, Denny Hamlin attempted to take the lead from McMurray but could not get infront of him. With 31 to go, Hamlin was able to take the lead from McMurray. With 27 laps to go, the 7th caution would fly for debris. The race would restart with 23 laps to go. With 20 to go, the 8th caution would fly when Kyle Larson crashed in turn 3 after he blew a left rear tire. The race would restart with 16 laps to go. With 14 laps to go, the 9th caution would fly when Brad Keselowski blew a left rear tire and spun off of turn 4. The race would restart with 10 laps to go. On the restart, Kyle Busch took the lead from Hamlin. At the same time, the 10th caution flew for the first of three big wrecks that would occur in the final 10 laps of the race. It started in turn 3 when Paul Menard was pushing Matt DiBenedetto but Menard bumped DiBenedetto at the wrong angle and turned DiBenedetto around right infront of the pack and collected a lot of more cars with them. During the wreck, David Ragan ended up lifting the rear of Aric Almirola's car and Ragan was underneath Almirola. DiBenedetto's race had unfortunately come to an end. DiBenedetto led a race high 49 laps and was in the midst of pulling off perhaps one of the greatest upsets in NASCAR history before he got collected. The wreck collected a total of 22 cars. The cars involved were Matt DiBenedetto, Paul Menard, Erik Jones, Ryan Blaney, Matt Tifft, Tyler Reddick, Daniel Suárez, Austin Dillon, Ryan Newman, Aric Almirola, David Ragan, Ricky Stenhouse Jr., Ryan Preece, Chris Buescher, Daniel Hemric, Martin Truex Jr., Chase Elliott, Jimmie Johnson, William Byron, Ty Dillon, Joey Logano, and Kyle Larson. The race was red flagged for about 20 minutes to clean up the wreck before the race restarted with 6 laps to go. Kyle Busch took the lead on the restart as he was looking for his first ever Daytona 500 win in his 15th try. But going into turn 3, the 11th caution would fly for the second big one of the race that collected 7 cars. It started when Ricky Stenhouse Jr. went to the inside of Kyle Larson to make it three wide but ended up making contact with Larson and sent Stenhouse into Kevin Harvick and it sent the three cars spinning into turn 3 and also collected Chase Elliott, Alex Bowman, Ty Dillon, and Brad Keselowski. During the wreck, Ryan Preece attempted to shoot through the gap of the spinning Elliott and Stenhouse and Preece was able to do so on the apron of the track unscathed. This put Preece in the 7th spot and in contention for the win. The race would restart with 2 laps to go. On the restart, Denny Hamlin took the lead. Going down the backstretch, Clint Bowyer went to make it three wide underneath Michael McDowell and William Byron but Bowyer ended up cutting across the nose of McDowell and turned up into Byron and Chase Elliott and triggered the third big one and the 12th and final caution of the race collecting 8 cars including Landon Cassill, Jamie McMurray, Brad Keselowski, and Brendan Gaughan. The wreck would cause another red flag and would set up overtime. On the restart, Hamlin would jump infront for the lead and Hamlin would be able to hold off the pack and win his second career Daytona 500 victory. The win was a special one for Hamlin and Joe Gibbs Racing after former college football player and NASCAR driver J. D. Gibbs, the son of Joe Gibbs, passed away over a month ago on January 11 at the age of 49. The win occurred seven days before Gibbs would've turned 50. Kyle Busch, Erik Jones, Joey Logano, and Michael McDowell rounded out the top 5 while Ty Dillon, Kyle Larson, Ryan Preece, Jimmie Johnson, and Ross Chastain rounded out the top 10. This would be Ross Chastain's first career Cup Series top 10.\nRace results.\nStage Results.\nStage One\n\"Laps:\" 60\nStage Two\n\"Laps:\" 60\nFinal Stage Results.\n\"Laps:\" 80\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nSince 2001—with the exception of 2002, 2004 and 2006—the Daytona 500 has been carried by Fox in the United States.

It takes place during the FIFA international match window.\nIt was not yet contested, as the first two editions were cancelled.\nHistory.\nThe first AFF–EAFF Champions Trophy match, to be played on a single-match format, was initially scheduled to be held on 26 March 2019 at the Mỹ Đình National Stadium in Hanoi, Vietnam between the national football teams of Vietnam and South Korea. However, on 19 February 2019, it was announced that the inaugural AFF–EAFF Champions Trophy match would be postponed until an unclear date in 2020 after both contesting teams failed to settle on a date for the match within the 2019 calendar.\nThe trophy will be contested biennially, with AFF and EAFF rotating the host venue duties and the former staging the first-ever Champions Trophy. Vietnam automatically won hosting right to the inaugural Champions Trophy match on 15 December 2018 after beating Malaysia 3–2 on aggregate score in the 2018 AFF Championship Final.

        "text": "The 2018 Men's Hockey World Cup Final was a field hockey match played between Belgium and the Netherlands on 16 December 2018 at the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar, India.\nBelgium won their first World Cup after defeating the Netherlands in the Final in penalty shoot-out. This was also Belgium's first ever world title in a team sport. Belgian goalkeeper Vincent Vanasch was named player of the match in the Final.\nRoute to the final.\nBelgium.\nBelgium entered the World Cup as one of the favorites and ranked third in the FIH World Rankings. They had enjoyed success in major tournaments in the preceding years, winning silver medals at the 2016 Summer Olympics and the 2017 EuroHockey Nations Championship.\nAt the World Cup, Belgium were drawn in Pool C alongside Canada, hosts India and South Africa. Belgium began the tournament with a 2–1 win over Canada through field goals by Félix Denayer and Thomas Briels. In their second pool match, they secured a 2–2 draw against India with a 56th-minute equalizer by Simon Gougnard. They came back from behind in their final group match against South Africa to post a 5–1 victory through goals by Alexander Hendrickx, Gougnard, Loïck Luypaert and Cédric Charlier. They finished second in the group with seven points, as India, who finished on the same number of points, had a better goal difference.\nBelgium defeated Pakistan 5–0 in the cross-over with Hendrickx, Briels, Charlier, Sébastien Dockier and Tom Boon scoring. In the quarterfinal against Germany, Belgium came back from being 0–1 down after the first quarter to winning 2–1, with an 18th-minute goal by Hendrickx from a penalty corner and a field goal by Boon in the 50th minute. They faced England in the semifinal who had knocked out Olympic gold medalists and second-ranked team in the world Argentina in the quarterfinal. Belgium dominated the semifinal, shutting out England 6–0 as Boon, Gougnard, Charlier, Hendrickx and Dockier scored for the Red Lions. Belgium thus entered their first ever World Cup final.\nNetherlands.\nRanked fourth in the world, the Netherlands were tipped prior to the World Cup as one of the contenders to win the tournament. The Dutch had finished runners-up at the 2014 World Cup and won the 2017 EuroHockey Nations Championship.\nThe Netherlands were placed in Pool D with Germany, Malaysia and Pakistan. They recorded a 7–0 win over Malaysia in the opening match, with the help of Jeroen Hertzberger's hat-trick. In the second game, the Dutch were leading Germany 1–0 until the 30th minute, before Germans scored four times, including thrice in the last quarter, to beat the Dutch 4–1. The Netherlands defeated Pakistan 5–1 in their final pool match, with goals from Thierry Brinkman, Valentin Verga, Bob de Voogd, Jorrit Croon and Mink van der Weerden.\nThe Dutch cruised into the quarterfinals with a 5–0 win over Canada in the cross-over. Facing the home team India in the quarterfinal, the Netherlands conceded a goal in the 12th minute but equalized three minutes later with a Brinkman field goal. Defender van der Weerden converted a penalty corner in the fourth quarter to seal a 2–1 victory for his team. The Dutch faced defending champions and world number one Australia in the semifinal. The Dutch took an early lead in the match as Glenn Schuurman netted one in the ninth minute and Seve van Ass doubled the lead with a goal in the second quarter. Australia pulled one goal back in the final minute of the third quarter before scoring the equalizer in the final minute of the fourth to push the game into penalty shoot-out. The Netherlands won the shootout 4–3 in sudden death, after the teams were level 3–3 from five strokes each.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nBelgium began the first quarter with Simon Gougnard having a shot at the goal in the second minute but the ball went just wide. Six minutes later Dutchman Jeroen Hertzberger successfully entered the Belgian circle, creating the first chance for his team, but shot well wide of the goal. The quarter ended with the game \"evenly poised\" as Belgium marginally led possession at 51%. Belgium continued to attack at the start of the second quarter but were intercepted twice in the 18th minute by Mirco Pruyser and Hertzberger. In the 26th minute, Thierry Brinkman stopped an attack by Belgian forward Cedric Charlier in the circle. The Dutch then pressed forward and won the first penalty corner of the match in the 28th minute but Hertzberger's shot was deflected away by Florent van Aubel. A minute later Belgium lost their referral after an unsuccessful appeal against a penalty corner that was awarded to the Netherlands. However, Mink van der Weerden was fouled for swinging his stick too high as another chance for the Dutch went in vain.\nTwo minutes into the second half, Dutch goalkeeper Pirmin Blaak made a diving save at a Thomas Briels' shot. Sebastien Dockier then took a shot in the 39th minute but it went wide across the goalpost. Belgian goalkeeper Vincent Vanasch made a comfortable save in the 49th minute, before a tackle by Nicolas De Kerpel in the circle denied the Dutch a chance at having another shot at the goal. Dutch midfielder Jonas de Geus picked up a green card in the 57th minute, leaving the Netherlands down to ten players for the subsequent two minutes. Neither team could break the 0–0 deadlock before the full time hooter and the match entered the penalty shoot-out stage.\nThe Dutch started well in the penalty shoot-out, securing a 2–1 lead after three shots each. After Seve van Ass missed the fourth try for the Netherlands, Belgium equalized through Victor Wegnez. Thijs van Dam failed to score for the Netherlands in their final shot thanks to a tackle by Vanasch. Belgium then had their goal overturned off their fifth try, as Blaak used the video referral upon noticing that the ball had bounced off Arthur De Sloover's foot just before the shot. With the score still tied at 2–2, the match headed to sudden death penalty shoot-out.\nBelgium went first in the sudden death and scored through van Aubel. The Netherlands used their referral again appealing for obstruction but the video umpire ruled in favor of Belgium. Hertzberger, needing to score to keep the Netherlands alive, was forced wide by Vanasch and missed his shot, giving Belgium a 3–2 victory and their maiden World Cup title.\nDetails.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\nAftermath.\nVanasch won the player of the match for his four saves in the penalty shoot-out. Defender Arthur van Doren was named the player of the tournament. At the conclusion of the match, Belgium displaced Australia as the top-ranked men's team in the FIH World Rankings, while the Netherlands moved up one place to third.\nOn 18 December, the Belgian team was welcomed home by thousands of fans at the Grand-Place in Brussels. Among those who were present at the celebrations were Queen Mathilde and King Philippe."

        "text": "Almaty 2014 () was one of the seven original bids for the 2014 Games, presented by the city of Almaty, Kazakhstan. It was the city's first bid for an Olympic Games.\nBid details.\nGovernment and public support and legal issues.\nAll of the associated public authorities in Kazakhstan, at national, regional and local tiers, supported the bid, including the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbaev. The bid committee confirmed that no new laws or amendments were needed in order to host the Games. Public support was high, with 82.8% of people in Almaty city, 93.5% in the Almaty region and 84.9% nationally saying they would support the bid.\nThe IOC gave the city a minimum grade of 4.7 and a maximum grade of 5.9 for this criterion, the second lowest after Borjomi and below the required grade of a 6.\nGeneral infrastructure.\nThe planned improvement to transport included new subway and light rail lines, a new city ring-road and additional roads connecting venues. These proposed improvements would cost a total of $8.7 billion with 93% of the cost in the expansion of the railways. Almaty International Airport was to be doubled in capacity and was assessed as being able to meet the needs of the Winter Olympics. Almaty's telecommunications network, however, was classed as \"less advanced\" according to an IOC commissioned IDATE report.\nThe IOC gave the city a minimum grade of 6.3 and a maximum of 7.9 for this criterion, the second best after Salzburg.\nSports Venues.\nAlmaty had six existing venues, with 8 other planned sites. The upgrade of the existing venues alone was estimated to cost $353 million but the bid showed this as part of the post-Olympic legacy and aimed to become a \"new winter sports destination for Central Asia\".\nThe IOC gave the city a minimum grade of 4.7 and a maximum of 6.9 for this criterion, below the required grade of a 6.\nOlympic Villages.\nThe Almaty bid consisted of two Olympic Villages, 45 km apart: one in Almaty with 5000 beds, the other in the Soldatskoe Valley with 800 beds and meant only to house the cross-country and biathlon athletes. Both the villages were proposed to be built as a joint venture between the cities of Almaty and Talgar and private firms. After the Games, the apartments at the Almaty Village would be sold to public buyers and those in the Soldatskoe Valley Village retained to provide additional tourist accommodation at the existing ski resort.\nAlmaty scored a minimum of 6.5 and maximum of 8.0 for this criterion, coming third behind Sochi and Salzburg.\nEnvironmental conditions and impact.\nAlmaty's bid proposed the use of the nearby Zailiskii Alatau mountains, where snowy conditions are consistent and stable. The bid also sought to combat the air pollution around the city, halving it by 2010 and 15% of the total venue budget would be spent on environmental and sustainability efforts.\nThe IOC awarded the city a minimum grade of 4.9 and maximum of 6.6 for this criterion, placing it equal with Sochi but behind Jaca, Salzburg and Pyeongchang.\nAccommodation.\nAlmaty's 4,029 existing hotel rooms at the time, were not enough for an Olympic Games. In order to increase the capacity sufficiently, the bid planned the construction of 14172 extra hotel rooms as well as a media village of 10000 rooms. Both the bid committee and the IOC recognised that the increase would be a challenge to complete on time.\nThe IOC gave Almaty a minimum score of 4.9 and a maximum score of 5.9 for this criterion, both of which are below the required grade of a 6. Almaty ranked fourth on accommodation, above Sofia, Borjomi and Jaca.\nTransport.\nAlmaty's transport concept for the Games was praised by the IOC for being \"simple\" and \"coherent\", with the travel times between venues and the Olympic Park relatively short, thanks to the efficient road and rail networks.\nAlmaty was awarded a minimum grade of 7.6 and a maximum of 8.8, placing it above every other applicant city."

To celebrate the 50th WSOP there was a $50,000 No Limit Hold'em event as well as the Big 50, a $500 buy-in No Limit Hold'em event with a guaranteed $5 million prize pool and $1 million for the winner. There was also a tournament open only to past WSOP bracelet winners. A short deck tournament was also held for the first time. All No Limit Hold'em events employed the Big Blind Ante format.\nThe $10,000 No Limit Hold'em Main Event began on July 3 and concluded on July 16. The structure of the Main Event was changed, with players now receiving 60,000 chips at the start of the tournament, up from 50,000 in 2018.\nRobert Campbell won two bracelets to earn Player of the Year honors. Daniel Negreanu was originally believed to have won the award for the third time, but it was later found that he was erroneously credited with a cash in an event where he didn't finish in the money. When points for that event were taken away, Negreanu finished third behind Campbell and the 2018 winner, Shaun Deeb.\nEvent schedule.\nSource:\nPlayer of the Year.\n\"Final standings as of November 4 (end of WSOPE):\"\nLeaders.\n\"Note: these statistics not including the 15 WSOPE events.\"\nMain Event.\nThe $10,000 No Limit Hold'em Main Event began on July 3 with the first of three starting flights. The final table of 9 was reached on July 12, with the finalists returning on July 14 before a winner was determined on July 16.\nThe Main Event attracted 8,569 players, the second-largest field in history after 2006. The winner earned $10,000,000, with 1,286 players finishing in the money. There was a mixup at the money bubble, with Ryan Pochedly originally being credited with bursting the bubble. Several days later, however, it was determined that one elimination had not been taken into account, and Pochedly had actually finished in 1,286th place, therefore making the money.\nThree past champions made the money, including Chris Moneymaker who cashed in the Main Event for the first time since winning in 2003. Moneymaker, along with David Oppenheim, was announced as the newest inductees into the Poker Hall of Fame during the final table.\nOther notable high finishes.\n\"NB: This list is restricted to top 100 finishers with an existing Wikipedia entry.\""

Each canoe or kayak can hold one person (1), two people (2), or four people (4). For each of the specific canoes or kayaks, such as a K-1 (kayak single), the competition distances can be 200, 500, 1000 or 5000 metres. When a competition is listed as a K-2 500m event, for example, it means two people were in a kayak competing over a distance of 500 metres.\nParacanoe competitions were contested in either a va'a (V), an outrigger canoe (which includes a second pontoon) with a single-blade paddle, or in a kayak (as above). All international competitions were held over 200 metres in single-man boats, with three event classes in both types of vessel for men and women depending on the level of an athlete's impairment. The lower the classification number, the more severe the impairment is – for example, VL1 is a va'a competition for those with particularly severe impairments.\nCanoe sprint.\nMedal table.\n Non-Olympic classes\nWomen.\n Non-Olympic classes\nParacanoe.\nMedal events.\n Non-Paralympic classes\nDoping violation.\nOn 19 August, the ICF announced that 11-time world champion Laurence Vincent-Lapointe was provisionally suspended from competition after testing positive for a banned substance. The substance in question was subsequently found to be Ligandrol, with Canoe Kayak Canada stating Ligandrol had been associated with recent tainted supplements and that preliminary information suggested Vincent-Lapointe's positive may have been the result of such."

        "title": "Luis Rojas (baseball)",
        "text": "Luis E. Rojas (born September 1, 1981) is a Dominican professional baseball coach and manager. After coaching for the New York Mets of Major League Baseball (MLB) in 2019, he managed the Mets from 2020 to 2021. Rojas joined the New York Yankees as third base coach after the 2021 season. He is the son of Felipe Alou, a former MLB player and manager.\nPlaying career.\nRojas grew up shagging fly balls, taking batting practice and running bases in Montreal as his father, Felipe Alou, managed the Montreal Expos. After graduating from a Catholic high school, Rojas was signed in 1999 as a third baseman by the Baltimore Orioles for $300,000. He spent time in the Miami Marlins system and then the Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals system. He spent the 2004 season as an infielder/outfielder with the Gulf Coast League Expos of minor league baseball. \"Luis had talent,\" said his father, Felipe Alou. \"He was a good-looking prospect, but he got hurt and had shoulder problems and he was never the player they thought he was gonna be.\"\nCoaching career.\nEarly coaching career.\nRojas began his coaching career with the Dominican Summer League Nationals in 2006. The New York Mets hired him as a coach for the Dominican Summer League Mets in 2007 and for the Gulf Coast League Mets in 2008. He became a coach for the Savannah Sand Gnats in 2010 but transferred back to manage the Gulf Coast League Mets in 2011. On his return to Savannah from 2012 through 2014, Rojas won the 2013 South Atlantic League championship and was named Manager of the Year the following season. Afterwards, Rojas became the manager for the St. Lucie Mets and led them to the top of their division.\nRojas managed in the Dominican Professional Baseball League team Leones del Escogido. He led the team to a league championship in the following 2015–16 season. Rojas managed the Binghamton Rumble Ponies in 2017 and 2018. The Mets named him to their major league coaching staff as the quality control coach for the 2019 season.\nNew York Mets manager.\nRojas was promoted to manager by Mets general manager Brodie Van Wagenen on January 22, 2020, after the Mets mutually parted ways with Carlos Beltrán due to his involvement in the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal. In his first year as manager, the Mets finished the regular season 26–34, tied for last place in their division. Van Wagenen lost his job at the end of the Covid-19-shortened season and was replaced by Sandy Alderson, who had a long relationship with Rojas and kept him on. \nOn April 20, 2021, Rojas was ejected from a game for the first time in his Major League career after arguing balls and strikes with home plate umpire John Libka. On July 18, Rojas was ejected and subsequently suspended for two games by Major League Baseball for \"excessive arguing\" over a fair-foul call in the first inning of a game at PNC Park. It was the first time in his career that he had been suspended at any level of baseball.\nThe Mets declined the option on Rojas's contract on October 4, 2021, after concluding the season with a record of 77–85. The Mets were the first team in major league history to sit atop a division for more than 100 days in a season and finish with a losing record.\nNew York Yankees.\nOn November 15, 2021, the New York Yankees hired Rojas as their third base coach.\nPersonal life.\nRojas is the son of former professional baseball player and manager Felipe Rojas Alou, as well as the half-brother of former outfielder Moisés Alou. Rojas is the ninth of 11 children Alou had via four marriages. Rojas' mother is Elsa Brens, Alou's third wife, a secretary for owners of the Dominican summer league. When Rojas was 3, his parents divorced.\nIn June 2021, he said: “Oh man, my father's been my university of life, not only of baseball. He's taught me a lot of things about baseball and life. He taught me how to be a good son. He taught me how to be a good father. He taught me how to be a good baseball man.\" The reason Luis and Felipe have different surnames is that when the San Francisco Giants' scout registered Felipe Rojas Alou's name, he used Felipe's mother's name, Alou, instead of his father's, Rojas.\nRojas and his wife, Laura, have one son, Luis Felipe.\nHe has been described as a \"deeply religious, workout-obsessed, wine-sipping, dominoes-playing, baseball lifer.\""

The Heritage Baseball Museum was founded in 1997 and is located at League Park, former home of the Cleveland Indians. The Baseball Heritage Museum is part of the renovated League Park complex and is housed in the former League Park ticket house.\nHistory.\nThe Baseball Heritage Museum was founded in 1997, and was first housed at a location in downtown Cleveland. To correspond with the 1997 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Cleveland's Jacobs Field, Robert Zimmer first displayed his family's collection of baseball historical items at the family jewelry store. \nThe Baseball Heritage Museum continued to grow from founder Robert Zimmer's personal family collection. It grew to include baseball artifacts from the major leagues, Negro leagues, women's baseball leagues, Caribbean leagues, industrial and barnstorming leagues.\nThe first \"Baseball Heritage Museum Festival\" took place in May 2006 with former players such as Bob Feller and Buck O'Neill attending.\nIn 2006, the Baseball Heritage Museum moved to a second location in the Euclid Arcade on Euclid Avenue in Cleveland. Finally, to correspond with renovation of the League Park site, the museum moved to its present location in 2014. League Park was the former home of the Cleveland Indians and other Cleveland-based teams and is on the National Register of Historic Places. As part of an extensive project, League Park was renovated in 2014 to include a new ballfield, and the museum is housed in the refurbished former Ticket House of League Park.\nIn 2014, there were 2,000 patrons in attendance for the grand opening of the new Baseball Heritage Museum location at League Park.\nFormer Cleveland Indians infielder Vern Fuller was the original executive director of the Baseball Heritage Museum. In 2017, Mike Gaynier was appointed executive director.\nToday, the museum sponsors the Baseball Heritage Museum Buckeyes Travel Baseball Team Program, as well as holding youth clinics and events at the renovated League Park."

Undrafted, Gross committed to collegiate hockey with the University of Notre Dame, beginning as a freshman in the 2014–15 season.\nIn his senior season with the Fighting Irish and although under-sized Gross developed into one of the top defenseman in the NCAA. In the 2017–18 season, Gross registered 10 goals and 30 points in 40 games, ranking third on Notre Dame in scoring and led all Fighting Irish defensemen in points. Gross helped the Fighting Irish advance to the Frozen Four championship game where he was named to the NCAA (Championship) All-Tournament Team and later the Big Ten Conference First All-Star Team.\nProfessional.\nArizona Coyotes.\nAs a free agent, Gross attracted NHL interest, opting to sign a two-year, entry-level contract with the Arizona Coyotes on April 12, 2018. He immediately joined the Coyotes' AHL affiliate, the Tucson Roadrunners, on an amateur try-out, making his professional debut in a solitary appearance and registering 2 assists to end the regular season, in a 6-3 victory over the San Diego Gulls on April 14, 2018.\nIn the following season, Gross was assigned to continue his development with the Roadrunners in the AHL, before he was recalled by the Coyotes on December 22, 2019, and made his NHL debut for the Coyotes against the Detroit Red Wings and scored his first NHL point with an assist on the Coyotes' fifth goal. Returning to the Roadrunners following two games, Gross tied for first among Tucson defensemen with 10 goals and finished second with 27 points while appearing in 56 contests.\nOn October 10, 2020, as a restricted free agent, Gross was signed to a one-year, two-way contract extension with the Arizona Coyotes. In the pandemic delayed season, Gross spent the majority of the season on the Coyotes extended taxi squad. On April 2, 2021, Gross registered a career-high 3 assists against the Anaheim Ducks, the most tallied by a Coyotes rookie defenseman in a single game since Keith Ballard in 2006. Gross finished with 3 points through 7 games before missing the final 14 games of the shortened season due to a lower body injury.\nColorado Avalanche.\nAs a free agent from the Coyotes, due to lack of games played at the NHL level, Gross was signed to a one-year, two-way contract with the Colorado Avalanche for the season on July 31, 2021. Assigned to AHL affiliate, the Colorado Eagles following training camp with the Avalanche, Gross was a staple on the blueline, leading all defenseman and tied for the team lead in scoring with 18 points through 21 games before earning his first recall to the Avalanche on December 15, 2021. He made his Avalanche debut the following day, taking two minor penalties in a 5-2 defeat to the Nashville Predators. He was returned to the Eagles following the game, as the Avalanche took a hiatus due to COVID-19. In continuing his break out season with the Eagles, Gross finished the regular season leading the league in scoring on the blueline with 10 goals and 55 assists for 65 points over 61 games, earning selection to the AHL's First All-Star Team. He was awarded the Eddie Shore Award in recognition of his season as the AHL's outstanding defenseman.\nNashville Predators.\nAs a free agent from the Avalanche, Gross capitalised on his successful season by agreeing to a two-year, $1.525 million contract with the Nashville Predators on July 13, 2022."

        "title": "Men's Home Internationals (golf)",
        "text": "The Men's Home Internationals were an amateur team golf championship for men between the four Home Nations. Ireland was represented by the whole island of Ireland.The event was organised by The R&amp;A. The inaugural event was held in 1932 and the venue cycled between the four nations. The winning team received the Raymond Trophy, presented by Raymond Oppenheimer, an ex-England and Walker Cup captain, in 1952. In 2022 the match was replaced by a combined Women's and Men's Home Internationals.\nHistory.\nAn England–Scotland Amateur Match had been first played in 1902. It was played in connection with the Amateur Championship, on the Saturday either before or after the championship. Starting in 1927 Scotland and Ireland had also played an annual match. In 1927 and 1929 this was held in Ireland, before the Irish Amateur Open Championship, while in 1928 and 1930 it was held in Scotland, just before the England–Scotland match.\nThe 1931 Amateur Championship was held at Royal North Devon. On the previous occasions that it had been held there, there were far fewer Scottish entries than normal and as a consequence, the Scottish team in the England–Scotland Match was not fully representative. It was therefore decided to hold the match at a different time and on a different venue, being played at Royal Liverpool in August. In addition, it was decided to play a match between England and Ireland on the day before. Ireland and Scotland had already decided to hold their match in Ireland in September. It was later arranged that a Welsh team should attend, playing matches against Scotland and Ireland on the days when England was playing Ireland and Scotland. Scotland beat England 7–6, England beat Ireland 10–4 while Wales lost 2–12 to Scotland and 2–11 to Ireland. England did not play Wales. With Scotland winning both their matches and then beating Ireland 7–6 the following month, they were regarded as the unofficial champion country.\nThe first tournament was held at Troon Golf Club on 2, 3, and 5 August 1932, there being no matches on the 4th. Matches followed the previous format with 5 foursome matches in the morning and 10 singles in the afternoon. Scotland and England beat Ireland and Wales on the first two days. On the final day, Scotland beat England 8–7 to win the title while Ireland beat Wales 9½–5½.\nThe 1933 tournament was held at Royal County Down Golf Club from 14 to 16 September. The results of all six matches were the same as in 1932, Scotland beating England in the decisive match. In the 1934 tournament at Royal Porthcawl Golf Club from 15 to 17 August, Ireland beat England on opening day. With Scotland beating England, Scotland retained the title with Ireland the runners-up. The 1935 event was held at Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes Golf Club from 7 to 9 August. The tournament resulted in a triple-tie; England beat Ireland on the opening day, Ireland beat Scotland on the second day, and then Scotland beat England on the final day. As in previous years, Wales lost all their matches.\nThe 1936 event was held at Prestwick Golf Club from 29 to 31 July. Scotland beat England on the final day to win the tournament, England finishing second and Ireland third. There was a surprise on the opening day of the 1937 tournament at Portmarnock Golf Club when Wales tied their match with Scotland. Played from 1 to 3 September it was the first time the event had been held in the Irish Free State. Despite their tie, Scotland retained the title by winning their other two matches, with England again the runners-up. Royal Porthcawl hosted the event for second time in 1938, from 21 to 23 September. England gained the title after beating Scotland for the first time. Scotland was runners-up with Ireland third. The 1939 matches were planned for 20 to 22 September at Royal Lytham but were cancelled because of the start of World War II.\nThe tournament resumed in 1947 at Royal Liverpool from 24 to 26 September. England and Scotland won their opening two matches. On the final day, England beat Scotland 8–7 while Ireland beat Wales to finish third. The England/Scotland match went to the final green of the final match. Duncan Sutherland and Jack Pressley were all square at the last hole but Pressley took 5 to Sutherland's 4 to give England a narrow win. England retained the title in 1948 at Muirfield, played from 22 to 24 September. England beat Scotland and Ireland on the opening two days but only beat Wales 8–6 on the final day. Ireland beat Scotland to be runners-up with Scotland third. The 1949 event was held at Portmarnock from 16 to 18 May. England again won the title, although they only narrowly beat Ireland 7–6 on the final day. Wales beat Scotland 8–6 on the last day to gain their first win in the event and finish third with Scotland losing all their matches.\nThe 1950 event was held at Royal St. David's from 27 to 29 September. Heavy rain on the first day meant that the singles matches were not played, and were rearranged for Saturday morning, 30 September. Ireland won their opening two matches while Scotland beat England and tied with Wales. This meant that Scotland needed to beat Ireland on the final morning to win the title. Scotland held a 3–2 lead after the foursomes but Ireland won the singles 4–3 to tie the match and win the title outright for the first time. England beat Wales to finish in third place. The 1951 tournament was played at Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes Golf Club. Ireland seemed the likely winner after beating Scotland and England, but they lost their last match to Wales 8–4, while Scotland beat England 7–6 to get their second win and tie with Ireland. Scotland won the 1952 event at Troon Golf Club, winning all three matches for the first time since 1936. England took second place. The singles could not be played on the second day, a Thursday, and were played on the Saturday. Scotland retained the title in 1953 at Killarney Golf Club, winning two matches and halving their final match against Ireland, who were runners-up.\nThe event was staged by England Golf, Scottish Golf, the Golfing Union of Ireland and Wales Golf until 2020 - The R&amp;A took over organising from 2021.\nFormat.\nEach team played the other three teams over three successive days. In the final format each team had 11 players. Each match involved 5 18-hole foursomes in the morning and 10 18-hole singles in the afternoon.\nResults.\nSource:\nMatch scores.\nThe following table gives the match scores. For a particular event these will not be in chronological order. E=England, I=Ireland, S=Scotland, W=Wales.\nTeams.\n\"This list is incomplete\"\nThe following played in at least one match."

It was the first esports contest as a medal event in a multi-sport competition sanctioned by the International Olympic Committee after the discipline featured as a demonstration sport at the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta, Indonesia.\nSix medals were contested in esports while a single demonstration event was also held. The games were accredited by the Asian Electronic Sports Federation.\nBackground.\nThe inclusion of esports in the Southeast Asian Games was lobbied by Min-Liang Tan, CEO of Singapore-based gaming firm Razer. Tan announced in November 2018 that he met with Philippine SEA Games Organizing Committee chair Alan Peter Cayetano to discuss about the possible inclusion of esports in the regional games, which were among the \"Category 3\" disciplines included in final list of proposed events to be hosted in the games.\nAn ad hoc committee was formed to organize the esports events in the games. Razer provided support in terms of software, hardware, and services in the organization of the esports events. Razer was designated as the Official Esports Partner. However Razer didn't provide the mobile phones for the \"Arena of Valor\" tournament since the latest update of the title required the game to be played on iOS.\nBy 14 December 2018, the national federation of esports has formally sought formal inclusion in the games from the International esports Federation.\nThe esports tournaments of the Southeast Asian Games were open to competitors of both genders with every aspiring participant to partake in a qualification tournaments. Although competitors should be at least 12 years old.\nMarket research firm Newzoo projects the number of audience for esports in Southeast Asia to grow to at least 31.9 million in 2019 attributing the increase to the inclusion of the discipline in the Southeast Asian Games.\nGame selection.\nSix medals were contested in esports. The selected games were to conform to the values of the International Olympic Committee and \"should not promote the culture of violence and gambling\". Also other factors, such as the popularity and competitiveness of the games, the strategy and teamwork required in playing the concerned games, as well as the physical and mental intensity required in contesting the games in marathon matches, were also considered in the selection process.\nThere were three categories; PC, console, and mobile each featuring two video games. \"\" was the first title to be confirmed in November 2018 Four games: \"Arena of Valor\", \"Dota 2\", \"Starcraft II\", and \"Tekken 7\", were later announced in mid-December 2018. The organizers attempted to secure the appropriate license to be able to have NBA 2K as the sixth title but was unable to do so. \"Hearthstone\" was announced as the sixth title in June 2019.\nThere were also previous plans for the esports tournament to feature separate competitions for men and women where men would be competing in \"Dota 2\", \"Hearthstone\", \"NBA 2K\", and \"Tekken 7\", while women would be contesting \"Dota 2\" and \"Hearthstone\". The plan was later abandoned.\nVenue.\nThe Esports competition of the 2019 Southeast Asian Games was held at the Filoil Flying V Centre (San Juan Arena) in San Juan, Metro Manila. Previously, The Manila Marriott Hotel in Pasay was considered as a potential venue but the hotel management asked for a fee which was deemed too expensive by the organizers of the regional games.\nViewership.\nRazer reported at least a million views on its streaming platform on the first day of the esport event with about 70,000 concurrent viewers. The Filoil Flying V Centre was at full capacity at the peak of the esport tournament and Razer registered 20 million impressions with 90,000 concurrent viewers. The esports tournament's YouTube streaming was also viewed for 200,000 hours by audiences."

        "text": "The 2005 Breeders' Cup Classic was the 22nd running of the Breeders' Cup Classic, part of the 2005 Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships program. It was run on October 29, 2005 at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York with a purse of $4,000,000. It was won by Saint Liam, who was subsequently named American Horse of the Year.\nThe Classic is run on dirt at a distance of miles (approximately 2000 m). It is run under weight-for-age conditions, with entrants carrying the following weights:\nContenders.\nThe Classic drew a full field although some of the most highly regarded horses of 2005 (Ghostzapper, Roses in May and Afleet Alex) were retired early due to injury. The leading contenders for the Classic were:\nIn the absence of Afleet Alex and Kentucky Derby winner Giacomo, Flower Alley (Travers Stakes) was the most highly regarded three-year-old. The New Zealand-bred horse Starcraft, who won the 2004 Australian Derby and 2005 Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, was supplemented to the Classic at a cost of $800,000 as he had not been nominated as a foal.\nDue to the dimensions of Belmont Park, the starting gate for the Classic was located on the clubhouse turn. This placed horses who drew outside post positions (especially Saint Liam and Starcraft) at a disadvantage as they would have to run somewhat farther. Rock Hard Ten drew post position one, which was also disadvantageous as he risked getting caught in traffic along the rail.\nRace Description.\nRock Hard Ten was scratched shortly before the race due to a hoof injury.\nAfter breaking poorly, Saint Liam settled into fifth place behind a moderate early pace set by Sun King and Suave. Flower Alley stalked the early leaders then took command rounding the turn. Racing four wide, Saint Liam moved alongside Flower Alley at the top of the stretch and gradually pulled away, winning by a length. Perfect Drift closed late to finish third.\nSaint Liam was the first major winner for trainer Rick Dutrow, who was highly emotional after the race. \"I can't explain the feeling. He gives me a feeling I've never had before. I owe him everything. He is my boy. I see him every night before I go to bed. And I'm going to miss him so much. Words just can't describe this horse.\"\nIt was jockey Jerry Bailey's fifteenth win at the Breeders' Cup, then a record. Bailey felt that Saint Liam had cemented Horse of the Year honors with the win, pointing out how much ground Saint Liam had lost at the start due to his outside post position and a poor break that shifted his course even further outside. \"He took the worse of it today, and still was very authoritative in winning.\"\nResults.\nTimes: – 0:23.98; – 0:47.68; – 1:12.23; mile – 1:36.87; final – 2:01.49.&lt;br&gt;\nFractional Splits: (:23.98) (:23.70) (:24.55) (:24.64) (:24.62)\nSource: Equibase Chart\nPayout.\nPayout Schedule:"

From 2018–19, the former IPFW athletic program represents only PFW, and its Summit League membership was assumed by PFW. Shortly before the dissolution took effect, but after the school's baseball season had finished, the athletic program announced that it would henceforth be known as the Purdue Fort Wayne Mastodons.\nOn October 3, 2018, Long Island University announced that it would merge its two current athletic programs—the LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds, members of the Northeast Conference (NEC), and LIU Post Pioneers, a Division II program in the East Coast Conference—into a single Division I program effective with the 2019–20 school year.

        "title": "Cricket in Sussex",
        "text": "Cricket in Sussex refers to the sport of cricket in relation to its participation and history within Sussex, England. One of the most popular sports in Sussex, it is commonly believed that cricket was developed in Sussex and the neighbouring counties of Kent and Surrey. Records from 1611 indicate the first time that the sport was documented in Sussex; this is also the first reference to cricket being played by adults. The first reference to women's cricket is also from Sussex and dates from 1677; a match between two Sussex women's teams playing in London is documented from 1747. Formed in 1839, Sussex County Cricket Club is believed to be the oldest professional sports club in the world and is the oldest of the county cricket clubs. Sussex players, including Jem Broadbridge and William Lillywhite were instrumental in bringing about the change from underarm bowling to roundarm bowling, which later developed into overarm bowling. For some time roundarm bowling was referred to as 'Sussex bowling'.\nSussex's 'golden era' was in the 2000s when the club won 8 competitions including the County Championship three times, winning the County Championship for the first time in 2003. Formed in 1971, the Sussex Cricket League is believed to be the largest adult cricket league in the world, with 335 teams in 2018.\nOrigins and development.\nEarliest recorded history.\nA mural at Cocking church (c1350) showing shepherds playing a bat and ball game is sometimes held to show that cricket existed earlier than the 16th and 17th centuries, but no stumps are shown in the mural and although the mural may show a sport it is not recognisably cricket.\nThe map of pre-1675 references to cricket shows a crescent with its most westerly point at Selsey, rising to Surrey and Kent in the north and on to Ruckinge in Kent, close to the Sussex border in east. Wynne-Thomas suggests that cricket is likely to have begun approximately where the three counties meet, around East Grinstead, and spread out from there.\nThe first reference to cricket being played as an adult sport was in 1611, when two men in Sidlesham were prosecuted for playing cricket on Sunday instead of going to church. In 1622, several parishioners of Boxgrove, near Chichester in west Sussex, were prosecuted for playing cricket in a churchyard on Sunday, 5 May. There were three reasons for the prosecution: one was that it contravened a local bye-law; another reflected concern about church windows which may or may not have been broken; the third was that \"a little childe had like to have her braines beaten out with a cricket batt\"! The latter reason was because the rules at the time allowed the batsman to hit the ball twice and so fielding near the batsman was very hazardous, as two later incidents drastically confirm.\nIn 1624, a fatality occurred at Horsted Keynes when a fielder called Jasper Vinall was struck on the head by the batsman, Edward Tye, who was trying to hit the ball a second time to avoid being caught. Vinall is thus the earliest recorded cricketing fatality. The matter was recorded in a coroner's court, which returned a verdict of misadventure. The tragedy was repeated in 1647 when another fatality was recorded at Selsey a player called Henry Brand being hit on the head by a batsman trying to hit the ball a second time. When the first Laws of cricket were encoded in 1744, it was illegal to hit the ball twice and a batsman breaking the rule was to be given out. The record of the 1624 case confirms that two villages, Horsted Keynes and West Hoathly, were involved in the match and provides further evidence of the growth of village cricket.\nIn 1628, an ecclesiastical case related to a game at East Lavant, near Chichester being played on a Sunday. One of the defendants argued that he had not played during evening prayer time but only before and after. It did him no good as he was fined the statutory 12d and ordered to do penance. Doing penance involved confessing his guilt to the whole East Lavant congregation the following Sunday. In 1637, another ecclesiastical case recorded parishioners of Midhurst playing cricket during evening prayer on Sunday, 26 February.\nThe record of the 1622 case at Boxgrove contains the earliest reference to the cricket bat. The term \"batt\" in cricket was peculiar to Sussex and Kent, where coastal smugglers were known in Sussex dialect and Kentish dialect as \"batmen\" because of the cudgels they carried. The earliest known reference to the wicket is contained in lines written in an old bible in 1680 which invited \"All you that do delight in Cricket, come to Marden, pitch your wickets\". Marden is north of Chichester.\nImportant cricket matches 1677 onwards.\nIn 1677, accounts of Thomas Lennard, 1st Earl of Sussex, include an item which refers to £3 being paid to him when he went to a cricket match being played at \"ye Dicker\", which was a common near Herstmonceux. In 1694, accounts of Sir John Pelham record 2s 6d paid for a wager concerning a cricket match at Lewes. Cricket was played by women as early as 1677 when it was recorded that Anne Lennard, Countess of Sussex, the wife of the Earl of Sussex was growing tired of the amusement, as played in Dicker near Herstmonceux.\nThe earliest known newspaper report of a major cricket match was in the \"Foreign Post\" dated Wednesday, 7 July 1697:\n\"The middle of last week a great match at cricket was played in Sussex; there were eleven of a side, and they played for fifty guineas apiece\".\nThe stakes on offer confirm the importance of the fixture and the fact that it was eleven a side suggests that two strong and well-balanced teams were assembled.\nThere is a newspaper report of a \"great match\" played in Sussex in 1697 which was 11-a-side and played for high stakes of 50 guineas a side. The match in 1697 was probably Sussex versus another county.\n18th century.\nThe most notable of the early patrons were a group of aristocrats and businessmen who were active from about 1725, which is the time that press coverage became more regular, perhaps as a result of the patrons' influence. These men included the 2nd Duke of Richmond and Sir William Gage. Slindon was backed by the Duke of Richmond and featured the star player Richard Newland. Village cricket continued to thrive in the 18th century. In 1717, Thomas Marchant, a farmer from Hurstpierpoint in Sussex, first mentioned cricket in his diary. He made numerous references to the game, particularly concerning his local club, until 1727. His son Will played for \"our parish\", as he often called the Hurstpierpoint team.\nThe diaries of Marchant and Thomas Turner, another Sussex diarist, from East Hoathly, show that in the 18th century cricket was commonplace in the Sussex Weald. In 1702, the Duke of Richmond's XI defeated an Arundel XI in Sussex. The source for this game is a receipt sent by one Saul Bradley to the Duke on 14 December 1702. The receipt was in respect of one shilling and six pence paid by the Duke \"for brandy when your Grace plaid at Cricket with Arundel men\". It is thought the brandy was bought to celebrate a victory.\nAfter the 1st Duke of Richmond died in 1723, his son Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, quickly succeeded him as cricket's main benefactor and became a famous patron of Sussex cricket for the next thirty years. The 2nd Duke enjoyed a friendly rivalry with his friend Sir William Gage, another Sussex patron. Their teams played each other many times and their earliest known contest was on Tuesday, 20 July 1725, five days after Sir William's team was beaten by unknown opponents. Our knowledge of these two games is based on a humorous letter sent by Sir William to the Duke on 16 July. Sir William bemoaned that he was \"shamefully beaten\" the previous day in \"his first match of the year\" but says nothing of his opponents. He then looked forward to playing the Duke's team next Tuesday and wished his Grace \"success in everything except his cricket match\". The main rival to Richmond and Gage was Edwin Stead of Maidstone, who was the first of the noted Kent patrons. The Sussex teams of Richmond and Gage enjoyed an inter-county rivalry with Stead's Kent that could have originated the concept of the County Championship. Other good players known to have been active in the 1720s were Edwin Stead of Kent; Edmund Chapman and Stephen Dingate of Surrey; Tim Coleman of London; and Thomas Waymark of Sussex.\nIn 1727 the first formal rules of cricket, the articles of agreement, were drawn up between the 2nd Duke of Richmond and Mr Alan Brodrick for two matches between a team from Sussex and another from Surrey. Gage's Sussex team in the 1729 season achieved the sport's earliest known innings victory against Kent. Given that Kent had effectively claimed the title of champion county in 1728, the first known instance of such a claim, Sussex could justifiably claim to have won the title in 1729. Sarah Lennox, Duchess of Richmond and Lennox sponsored three cricket matches for her husband Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond in 1731 and arranged matches for Slindon in 1741.\nEarly women's matches were not necessarily genteel affairs. A match, on 13 July 1747, held at the prestigious Artillery Ground in Middlesex (now London) between a team from the villages of Singleton and Charlton (described as the women from the 'Hills of Sussex') and another from West Dean and Chilgrove (described as the women from the 'Dales of Sussex') spilled over into the following day after it was interrupted by crowd trouble. The women playing would have shown particular talent to have played at such as prestigious ground and would have been attended by the Duchess of Richmond. The fixture attracted large sums of gambling money, with sums of over £1,000 at stake for the winners. Contemporary records show that women's matches were played on many occasions between villages in Sussex, Hampshire and Surrey. In 1768 the women of Harting played the women of Rogate three times in a series that attracted crowds of up to 3,000, a number unheard of at the time. In the 1780s and 1790s the Bury Common women's team were so successful when playing in some of the first six-a-side matches that they challenged any eleven in the country to a match, including the men's All England XI to a match, with no response from the men's team.\nFrom 1741, Richmond patronised the famous Slindon Cricket Club, whose team was representative of the county and at one stage was proclaimed to be the best team in England. Slindon's best player was the great Richard Newland, supported by his brothers Adam and John; and by the controversial Edward Aburrow, a good cricketer but a known smuggler. After the death of Richmond in 1751, Sussex cricket declined until the emergence of the Brighton club at its Prince of Wales Ground in 1790. Despite some periods of decline, Sussex continued to be a major cricket county throughout the 18th century. It has been suggested by historians that the Hambledon Club represented Sussex as well as Hampshire for inter-county purposes. Several noted Sussex cricketers, including Richard Nyren, Noah Mann and William Barber, played for Hambledon.\nDevelopment of roundarm bowling.\nIn 1826, Sussex had the best team in England and were acclaimed as the \"Champion County\" in some quarters. Their success owed much to the prowess of two top-class bowlers William Lillywhite and Jem Broadbridge, both of whom were champions of the roundarm style, when they could get away with it. Lillywhite was one of the all-time great bowlers and was nicknamed \"the Nonpareil\", while roundarm bowling became known as 'Sussex bowling'. Complaints were made and in 1827 the MCC arranged to test the validity of roundarm bowling by holding three All-England v Sussex roundarm trial matches. Their purpose was to help the MCC, as the game's lawgivers, to decide if roundarm bowling should be legalised or if the only legitimate style of bowling should be underarm, which had been in use since time immemorial. Sussex won the first two matches but the trial was seen as inconclusive. Although it was many years before roundarm was formally legalised, roundarm was in practice adopted in 1827 as its practitioners, especially Broadbridge and Lillywhite, continued to use it with little, if any, opposition from the umpires.\nFormation of Sussex County Cricket Club.\nOn 17 June 1836, the Sussex Cricket Fund was set up to support county matches, after a meeting in Brighton. This led directly to the formation on 1 March 1839 of Sussex County Cricket Club, England's oldest county club.\nIn 1851, a Sussex cricketer, William Henty, bowled the first ever ball in a first class cricket match in Australia. In 1864, former Sussex cricketer John Wisden published the 'Wisden Cricketers' Almanack', a cricket reference book that is considered the world's most famous sports reference book.\nIn 1876 James Lillywhite became the first ever captain of the English cricket team in a Test match, captaining two Tests against Australia in 1876–77.\nAlso in 1876, Sussex MP third Earl of Sheffield laid out a cricket pitch at Sheffield Park near Haywards Heath. It was used on 12 May 1884 for the first cricket match in England between England and Australia. In 1891, he presented a donation of £150 to the New South Wales Cricket Association which was used to purchase a plate and establish the competition known as the Sheffield Shield, the domestic first-class cricket competition of Australia.\nThe White Heather Club, the first female cricket club in England was formed in 1887 at Nun Appleton Priory in Yorkshire by eight ladies who thought it \"advisable to start a club consequence of the large amount of cricket at Normanhurst, Glynde and Eridge\". Although the club was formed in Yorkshire, the eight noblewomen who founded the club were based in Sussex at the country houses of Normanhurst, Glynde and Eridge, which were the seats of the Brassey and Nevill families.\nIn the late 20th century and early 21st century the County Ground in Hove was used for other cricket matches in addition to matches involving Sussex teams. A One Day International match of the 1999 Cricket World Cup between India and South Africa was staged at Hove. Also, various matches involving England women's cricket team as well as the finals of the 2017 and 2018 Women's Cricket Super League tournaments were held at Hove. The 2019 tournament is also due to be played at Hove.\nGoverning body.\nOn 1 November 2015, the Sussex Cricket Board (SCB) merged with Sussex County Cricket Club (SCCC) to form a single governing body for cricket in Sussex, called Sussex Cricket Limited (SCL).\nCounty cricket.\nMen.\nIt has been suggested that the first county match was the match in 1697 recorded as a \"great match\" worth 50 guineas was between Sussex and another county. Teams represented Sussex unofficially but it was not until 1836 a meeting took place in Brighton to set up a Sussex Cricket Fund and on 1 March 1839 Sussex County Cricket Club was formally constituted, the first county cricket club in cricket history. Following the formation of the County Championship in 1890, Sussex were runners-up on seven occasions before winning the County Championship in 2003, 2006 and 2007.\nLimited overs.\nSussex won the inaugural one-day Gillette Cup in 1963, a feat they repeated the following year and again in 1978. The competition was then known as the NatWest trophy, which they won in 1986 and then the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy, which they won in 2006.\nSussex also won the 1982 Sunday League, then winning the 2008 and 2009 editions of the 40-over competition.\nTwenty20.\nThe Sussex Sharks won the Twenty20 Cup in 2009 and were runners-up in the 2018 t20 Blast.\nAs winners of the 2009 Twenty20 Cup the Sussex Sharks competed in the 2009 Champions League Twenty20 tournament in India. Sussex suffered defeats at the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground in Delhi to Australia's New South Wales Blues and the Diamond Eagles, from South Africa.\nWomen.\nIn the women's game, Sussex have won the Women's County Championship six times, in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2010 and 2013. With Kent, they have been referred to as being in the 'big two' of the women's game.\nCounty cricket grounds.\nSixteen different grounds in Sussex have been used for first class county cricket. Sussex's first main ground was Royal New Ground in Brighton to 1847. From 1848 to 1871, Sussex CCC used the Royal Brunswick Ground in Hove, also known as C H Gausden's Ground, and since 1872, the club has been based at the County Cricket Ground, Hove, its present home.\nSince Cricketfield Road in Horsham was not awarded any matches for the 2016 season due to financial difficulties. The County Ground and Arundel Castle are the only two grounds two grounds scheduled to host Sussex matches in the 2016 season.\nUsed annually as an outground by Kent County Cricket Club, the Nevill Ground in Tunbridge Wells straddles the historic boundary between Sussex and Kent. Following administrative changes in 1894 the ground and its surrounding area has been administered as part of Kent.\nClub cricket.\nFounded in 1971, the Sussex Cricket League is the top level of competition for recreational club cricket in Sussex. Since 1999 the Premier Division of the Sussex Premier League has been a designated ECB Premier League. After Sussex clubs voted unanimously to allow Guernsey Sarnians to join the competition, Guernsey joined the Sussex Cricket League from 2016. With nine titles, Preston Nomads are the league's most successful club.\nSince November 2018 the Sussex Cricket League is the largest adult cricket league in the world, with 335 participating teams in 34 divisions. In 2018 the Sussex Cricket League saw the integration of the East Sussex Cricket League, Mid Sussex Cricket League, West Sussex Invitation Cricket League and the Sussex Premier Cricket League.\nIn 1997 [Eastbourne Cricket Club]] became the first Sussex team to have won the ECB National Club Cricket Championship.\nSussex has some of the oldest cricket clubs in the world. Dating from 1704, Arundel is the oldest cricket club in Sussex. Other cricket clubs formed in the 18th century include Steyning (1721), East Grinstead (1731, reformed 1857), Slindon (1740-1754), Battle (1738), Rye (1754), Maresfield (1756), Firle (1758), Rottingdean (1758), Chalvington &amp; Ripe (1762), Broadwater (1771), Henfield (1771), Petworth (1784), Brighton (1790-1839), Southwick (1790) and Wadhurst &amp; Lamberhurst (1790).\nInternational cricket.\nInternational cricket took place in Hove in part of the 1999 Cricket World Cup when India played South Africa.\nIn 1987 and 2005 England played Australia in women's Test matches at Hove. This was followed in 2013 England played Australia twice in One Day Internationals at Hove, and played Australia at Hove in a T20 match in 2015. They are due to play Australia in a T20 match again at Hove in 2019.\nNotable cricketers from Sussex.\nThe following people from Sussex have played Test cricket for England:"

        "text": "The 1953–54 RPI Bachelors men's ice hockey team represented Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in intercollegiate college ice hockey during the 1953–54 NCAA men's ice hockey season. The head coach was Ned Harkness and the team co-captains were Frank Chiarelli and Jim Shildneck. The team won the 1954 NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. The team's leading scorer was Abbie Moore, who finished tied for second in the nation with 68 points.\nSeason.\nComing off a Tri-State League championship and the program's first appearance in the NCAA tournament, Rensselaer was primed to build on the previous years' success with the top five scorers all returning for another season. Also from the previous campaign was starting netminder Bob Fox who was among the best goalies in the nation in 1953.\nThe Bachelors opened their season with nine of their first ten games at home and used that to their advantage, sweeping the five games they played before the winter break. Their first big game came against Yale in New Haven where RPI would defeat a team that finished 4th in the east 4–2. After the break Rensselaer hosted their third Holiday Tournament and after winning games over Brown and Princeton they lost their first game of the season against St. Francis Xavier in the tournament championship. RPI won two more games, pushing their record to 9–1–0, before taking a week off in preparation for their weekend trip to Colorado.\nPlaying at high altitude for the first time since the previous year's tournament Rensselaer came out flat against a decent Denver squad, dropping their first contest 3–8 and followed that up with an identical loss to Colorado College the next night. After a day off the Bachelors returned to Denver for a rematch with the Pioneers and though they lost once more the fared much better in the game, losing 2–3 as they seemed to finally find their skating legs. Three days later RPI was back in New York facing Hamilton on the road and despite the jet lag they trounced the Continentals 11–0. Two days later the Bachelors finally opened their conference schedule with a win at Clarkson but after another win at Middlebury they dropped a match at St. Lawrence 4–5.\nWith RPI in danger of losing a chance at the NCAA tournament to the Saints they had no margin for error and swept the rest of their schedule until the rematch with the Larries on March 5. The game had been sold out for months and when the teams met they produced one of the most exciting games ever held at Houston Field House. Rensselaer skated away with the victory, earning them a tie with St. Lawrence as the co-champions of the Tri-State League. Despite the victory, however, the Saints had a better record, going 18–3–1 over the course of the season and were expected to be picked for the tournament but a selection of coaches and officials chose the Bachelors to head to the championship instead. Rensselaer's appearance was such a surprise that St. Lawrence had been included on the tournament programs and had their logo on the wooden pennant hanging outside the Broadmoor World Arena.\nThe \"RIP\" Bachelors entered as the fourth seed and drew Michigan who, despite having a lesser record than Minnesota, was the three-time defending champion and was riding a 7-game tournament winning streak. Rensselaer would have to wait, however, as Boston College opened against the Golden Gophers and were mercilessly eviscerated by Minnesota, losing by the largest margin in tournament history (1–14). Rensselaer had been given no chance entering the tournament but after the first semifinal there was a feeling from the spectators that Michigan would produce an equally lopsided victory. With all of the insults, slights and dismissals levied at their team the Bachelors responded in the only way they could; the small but fast team outskated the heavily favored Wolverines and with Gordie Peterkin recording a hat-trick, including the game-winner, Rensselaer won what was then considered the biggest upset the tournament had ever seen. Not only was their 6–4 win the first tournament victory by an eastern team over a western team in three years but it was the first time Rensselaer had ever defeated a western school.\nWhile the defeated Wolverines took their frustrations out on their hotel rooms, the Bachelors had to prepare themselves for a showdown with the Golden Gophers the next night. The Bachelors opened the game with the first three goals of the contest, one from each of their top three scorers. While the crowd may have been stunned Minnesota was not and they came roaring back with four consecutive goals to take the lead in the third period. Just when it looked like Rensselaer's chance at the title had slipped away Frank Chiarelli set up Abbie Moore for his second goal of the game to tie the score with 3:50 left in regulation and sent the game into overtime, the first time the championship game would need an extra period. The tying goal seemed to buoy RPI who came out of the intermission flying and before two minutes had elapsed Peterkin had notched his second winning goal of the tournament.\nRensselaer's win was so improbably that it apparently flummoxed the voters for the tournament awards. Four Bachelors made their way onto the First All-Tournament Team: Bob Fox, Jim Pope, Frank Chiarelli and Gordie Peterkin. However it was Abbie Moore who was named as the Most Outstanding Player, the only time in tournament history that the MOP was not on the top team.\nThe Bachelors returned home to a hero's welcome and, though few continued to play once their time at Rensselaer was over, the thirteen men who had earned one of the most improbable championships in history would be remembered by the RPI faithful.\nNote: In the Spring of 1953 the Student Body voted that 'Bachelors' would be the new nickname of all athletic teams for RPI. The moniker would revert to Engineers in 1958.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "title": "Andrew Porter (baseball)",
        "text": "Andrew Porter (March 7, 1910 – July 1, 2010) was an American Negro league baseball and Minor League Baseball pitcher. Listed at 6' 4\" (1.95 m), 190 lbs (86 kg), Porter batted and threw right handed. He was born in Little Rock, Arkansas. Colloquially known as 'Andy Pullman', because he worked as hard as a Pullman porter, he was noted for his overpowering fastball and a hard-to-hit slider.\nPorter joined the Negro Baseball leagues in 1932 and retired in 1954 after a 22-year career, playing for several teams all over the country and even outside its borders, in Canada Cuba, Mexico and Venezuela.\nCareer.\nPorter started his career with the Cleveland Cubs in 1932, pitching for them briefly before joining the Louisville Black Caps and then moving across the league to finish the season with the Nashville Elite Giants, the franchise for which Porter would play the majority of his Negro league career. Porter, along with Bill Byrd and Jonas Gaines, formed part of the Big Three on the Elite Giants' pitching staff.\nFor the next six seasons Porter was a mainstay pitcher for the Elite Giants, which became rather nomadic, moving from Nashville, Tennessee to Columbus, Ohio in 1935 and to Washington D.C. in 1936, before landing finally in Baltimore, Maryland in 1938.\nAs a 22-year-rookie, Porter had a 1–3 record in four games in 1933, improving to a 8–6 mark and a 3.53 ERA in a 18-game campaign in 1934, when he was selected for the East–West All-Star Game after collecting the second-highest vote total of any Elite Giants player, although he did not appear in the game. During the off-season, he pitched particularly well in the California Winter League, going 12–3 for the Giants, including 66 strikeouts while allowing only 21 walks in 122.0 innings of work.\nIn 1935, Porter lost a significant part of the season due to an illness. Nevertheless, he was impressive enough during the remainder of the year, going 3–1 with a 2.73 ERA in six appearances and earning a repeat selection to the East–West All-Star Game, but he was not used in the game.\nAfterwards, Porter had two subpar seasons, going 3–3 with a 5.75 ERA in 1936 and 1–6, 4.66 in 1937, being selected for the East–West All-Star Game in this last season. Once more, Porter did not appear in the game, but he was persistent and would show his skills in other significant showcases games. It came in October 1936 during an exhibition series, when Porter faced an all-white, All-Star team that included future Hall of Famers Rogers Hornsby and Johnny Mize, as he was 1–1 with a 3.00 ERA in two appearances. In Game 2, he hurled four innings on one earned-run while striking out eight, including Hornsby twice. Unfortunately, Porter charged with the loss after an unearned run was scored on two errors in the ninth inning. In Game 5, he was credited with the win in six innings of relief for the starter Satchel Paige, allowing just two runs and retiring Hornsby and Mize with the bases loaded in the fifth inning.\nPorter stayed with the Elite Giants in 1938, posting a 4–1 record and 2.57 ERA in six games (five starts) before jumping to the Mexican League the following spring, when he joined the Alijadores de Tampico in 1939. Overall, Porter finished with a 10–7 record and a 2.28 ERA for Tampico, leading the league with 111 strikeouts while pitching in the inaugural Mexican League All-Star Game played on August 29 in Mexico City. During the winter, he traveled to Cuba and went 3–4 for the Leopardos de Santa Clara club.\nMeanwhile, a Negro league baseball ban on players who jumped to Mexico had been clarified before the 1940 season as a three-year suspension. As a result, Porter returned for a second season in the Mexican League in 1940. He then shifted to the Tecolotes de Nuevo Laredo, where he became a real workhorse, appearing in nearly half of his team's games and winning 21 of their 39 victories while ending with a 3.34 ERA. Furthermore, he led the league with 27 complete games, 296 innings pitched, 232 strikeouts and 125 walks, each of which were at the time league records. The strikeout record would last 12 years before Cuban pitcher Lino Donoso broke it in 1954. After that, Porter pitched in the 1940–1941 Cuban Winter League season. He went 6–5 for the Alacranes de Almendares, a team that otherwise finished last with a disappointing record of 20–26 in the four-team league.\nBut Porter slowed his performance in 1941 with the Diablos Rojos del México, posting a 11–16 record and a 4.47 ERA. Although he led the league with 133 strikeouts, Porter had problems with his control and gave up 116 walks in innings.\nIn 1942, Negro league baseball rescinded their ban on players in Mexico and Porter returned to the Elite Giants in the spring. He had a 7–1 record with the Elites, but after joining the Azules de Veracruz in the Mexican League, he continued struggling with his control and dropped to a 5–8 record with a 5.66 ERA and only 47 strikeouts to 81 walks.\nThe following season Porter appeared in only three games without a decision for Veracruz, before rejoining the Elite Giants through the remainder of 1943. He went 2–3 with a 6.17 ERA in nine games.\nUpon his return to the Elites, Porter recovered his form and won 3 of his 4 decisions in 1944, and followed in 1945 with a perfect 7–0 record and a 3.38 ERA in 11 games, including two shutouts, leading the league in winning percentage and showing good control while striking out 30 batters and walking 18 in innings.\nIn 1946, his last year with the Elite Giants, Porter was 5–5 with a 4.30 ERA in 13 games, including 47 strikeouts to 23 walks in 90.0 innings. This renewed success drew the attention of Nuevo Laredo and Porter returned briefly to Mexico, going 2–2 with a 5.12 ERA for the Tecolotes in 1947.\nThereafter, Porter returned to the Negro leagues and played briefly with the Newark Eagles in 1947 and for the Indianapolis Clowns over the course of three seasons from 1948 to 1950. He posted a 4–5 mark with a 4.68 ERA in 1948, improved to a 10–6 record with a 3.64 ERA in 1949, and appeared in only three games in 1950, winning his only two decisions.\nAt this time, he finally made an All-Star appearance at age 38, pitching three hitless innings for the East team and combining with two other pitchers to hold the West squad on two hits in a 4–0 shutout in the 1949 East–West All-Star Game. Porter was preceded by Bob Griffith and followed by Pat Scantlebury, who allowed two singles in the final three innings.\nIn between, Porter played winter ball with the Sabios de Vargas club of the Venezuelan League in its 1949–1950 season. He posted a 5–6 record and a 5.26 ERA in 18 appearances, including 12 starts and five complete games, but struggled with his control throughout the season while allowing 60 walks and striking out 37 in 101.0 innings. After that, he pitched briefly for the Winnipeg Buffaloes of the Mandak League in the summer of 1950.\nFollowing a year off, Porter joined the Porterville Comets of the Southwest International League in 1952; being part of the first all-black team to play in Minor League Baseball as well as one of the first clubs with an African American manager. Porter was slated to hold the second slot on the pitching staff behind player-manager Chet Brewer and, despite his age of 41, enthusiastically was well above average in the six-team league, posting a 3–5 mark and a 4.27 ERA in 78.0 innings of work. He spent his final playing days in the Mandak League with the Carman Cardinals, appearing for them over part of two seasons spanning 1952–1953.\nRetirement.\nAfter baseball, Porter began working for Goodyear Rubber Company in 1954. He retired in 1977 and moved to Los Angeles, California.\nPrior to the start of the 2008 MLB Draft, Major League Baseball held a special draft of the surviving Negro league players to acknowledge and rectify their exclusion from the major leagues on the basis of race. The idea of the special draft was conceived by Hall of Famer Dave Winfield, well known for his exceptional community service through the years. Every MLB team participated in the selection process, as 'Andy Pullman' was drafted as a pitcher by the Los Angeles Dodgers. At first, Porter had no idea about it, but then he saw recognition in his eyes. He was ill at the time of the ceremony, but received recognition in absentia.\nPorter died in 2010 in Los, Angeles, California. At the time of his death, he was the second oldest living Negro league ballplayer after Emilio 'Millito' Navarro.\nNotes.\nSocial Security Death Index and Porter's grave marker both give Porter's birth year as 1910. Porter's birth year is elsewhere listed as 1911. In the 1920 U.S. Census, Porter is listed as age 10 when enumerated on January 12, 1920. This more closely aligns with the 1910 birth year.\nExternal links.\n, or Arkansas Baseball Encyclopedia, or Negro Leagues Baseball Museum or Seamheads"

PASO selected Rio de Janeiro, Brazil over San Antonio, United States as the host for 15th Pan American Games on August 24, 2002, at its general assembly held in Mexico City, Mexico by a vote of 30 to 21.\nCandidate cities.\nRio de Janeiro, Brazil.\nAs early as 1999, Rio de Janeiro decided to bid for the 2007 Pan American Games over the 2008 Summer Olympics. Rio de Janeiro representatives cited that their beaches were superior to the San Antonio River Walk, their conditions for the games were better, and that hosting the games would mean more to Brazil than the United States. Additionally, Brazil on in a emergential basis, agreed to host the 2002 South American Games in four cities, including Rio de Janeiro, after the games had to be relocated away from its initial host Medellin, Colombia, due to city violence concerns, with just three months of planning. Rio also took advantage of the world climate post the September 11 attacks in the United States, touting that they were a terrorism-free city.\nSan Antonio, United States.\nOn October 16, 1999, San Antonio was selected over Houston, Raleigh-Durham, and Miami to be the running host city for the 2007 Pan American Games by the United States Olympic Committee. In many circles, San Antonio was the clear front-runner to hold the games. Financially, $4.6 million of the $5.5 million the city promised for the games was already in the bank, and the city promised free airfare, hotel rooms, food, and long-distance calls for all of the athletes and delegates. Additionally, the bid noted that the city had every venue already built, sans a main track and field stadium and a velodrome.\nMuch to many peoples surprise, San Antonio did not win the host rights. San Antonio's bid committee members were \"reeling in disbelief,\" due to the fact that San Antonio had hosted numerous multi-sport international games and had been trying to hold the Pan American Games for 15 years. Some sources claim that the city's chances of winning were hampered by the political relationship between the USOC and PASO."

        "text": "Colin Campbell (born April 17, 1991) is a Canadian professional ice hockey winger for Kunlun Red Star of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).\nHe won the Calder Cup in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the Grand Rapids Griffins in 2017. Prior to turning professional, Campbell played four seasons with Lake Superior State University before signing as an undrafted free agent with the Detroit Red Wings organization.\nPlaying career.\nEarly career.\nAlthough Campbell began skating before he was four years old, he also played golf, baseball, football and rugby growing up before eventually committing to hockey when he was 15. He began his minor hockey career by playing on the AAA Toronto Red Wings Midget team in the Greater Toronto Hockey League.\nIn 2008, Campbell graduated from Dunbarton High School while playing with the Vaughan Vipers of the Ontario Junior Hockey League. In December 2009, Campbell committed to play NCAA Division 1 hockey for Lake Superior State University. While serving as captain for the Vaughan Vipers, Campbell was invited to the 2009 Canadian Junior Hockey League Prospects Game and 2009 World Junior A Challenge. At the conclusion of the 2009–10 season, Campbell was awarded the OJHL Top Prospects Award.\nCampbell began his freshman season at Lake Superior State University during the 2010–11 season. He played in 37 games and recorded seven points. After a standout sophomore season, Campbell missed the first 30 games of the 2012–13 season due to an offseason shoulder surgery.\nAfter the conclusion of his senior year, Campbell signed a two way entry level contract with the Detroit Red Wings on March 17, 2014. On the same day, he also signed an amateur tryout contract with the Red Wings American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Grand Rapids Griffins, to complete the season with them.\nProfessional.\nCampbell made his AHL debut on March 21, 2014. He scored his first AHL goal against the Rockford IceHogs on March 29.\nIn his first full season with the Griffins during the 2014–15 season, Campbell recorded five points in 44 games. Following the introduction of head coach Todd Nelson, Campbell gained time on the Griffins penalty kill and recorded a career high 18 points in 70 games during the 2015–16 season. He also recorded his first professional hat-trick during a 7–3 win over the Lake Erie Monsters on December 26, 2015.\nOn October 3, 2016, Campbell was released from his professional try out with the Red Wings and returned to the Griffins for the 2016–17 season. He won the Calder Cup with the Griffins that season.\nCampbell re-signed a two-year contract with the Grand Rapids Griffins on August 24, 2017. He attended the Red Wings 2017 Training Camp but was returned to the Griffins for the 2017–18 season. During that season, Campbell played in his 200th AHL game on November 18, 2017, against the Rockford IceHogs and later recorded his second professional hat trick in a 6–4 win over the Cleveland Monsters to help clinch second place in the division leading up to the 2018 Calder Cup playoffs. During the 2018 Calder Cup playoffs, Campbell was suspended from Game 3 against the Manitoba Moose due to an illegal check to the head.\nCampbell began the 2018–19 season on the sidelines due to an upper body injury. He missed 13 games before returning to the lineup.\nAfter six seasons within the Griffins organization, Campbell left the club as a free agent. On September 23, 2019, Campbell accepted an invitation to attend the 2019 training camp of the Colorado Avalanche. With a successful pre-season Campbell was assigned to AHL affiliate, the Colorado Eagles, and was signed to a professional try-out contract to begin the 2019–20 season on October 4, 2019. Adding a veteran presence to the depth forwards for the Eagles, Campbell was later signed to a one-year AHL contract in Colorado on November 25, 2019. In 48 games, Campbell contributed offensively with 10 goals and 26 points, before the season was abruptly cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs a free agent and with the following North American season to be delayed, Campbell opted to sign his first contract abroad by agreeing to a one-year deal with Austrian club, Vienna Capitals of the ICE Hockey League, on September 4, 2020. On June 25, 2021, he signed a one-year contract with Augsburger Panther of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). On June 25, 2022 Campbell was signed by HC Košice of Slovakia's Tipos Extraliga. However, his stint with HC Košice was short and on December 25, he signed with Kunlun Red Star of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) until the end of the 2022–23 season."

In 1967 the teams were reduced to five with four playing in each session.\nAll nine events were held over two days. Matchplay threesomes were used in which each of the three played the other two simultaneously. Alternate-shot matches were played as well as single matches.

Martínez notched 5 hits in 18 plate appearances for Chunichi in 2020. The Cuban catcher Ariel Martinez shone again on Wednesday in Japanese baseball, when he hit a homer that led to the victory of the Chunichi Dragons over the Yakult Swallows. Playing left field, the versatile Martinez went 2-3, with a run scored and a walk, to leave his average at .333, and get the only run of the game, which ended 1-0 in favor of his team. He became a free agent following the 2022 season.\nHokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters.\nOn December 21, 2022, Martinez signed with the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters of Nippon Professional Baseball.\nPersonal life.\nLike most of the Cuban children from his generation, Ariel Martínez admires legendary Cuban catcher Ariel Pestano. One catcher that he likes to study and emulate his game off of is Kansas City Royals catcher Salvador Pérez.

All the matches were played at the Stormont Cricket Ground in Belfast and the Bready Cricket Club Ground in Magheramason. Zimbabwe last toured Ireland in 2003.\nCricket Ireland had considered cancelling the tour, following poor ticket sales for international matches earlier in the season, but the International Cricket Council (ICC) provided a US$500,000 bailout. The T20Is were scheduled to take place on the same days and venues as the corresponding women's fixtures. However, in June 2019, the women's tour was cancelled 48 hours before it was due to take place, due to a funding issue from Zimbabwe Cricket. With the cancellation of the women's matches, Cricket Ireland revised the start time of the first men's T20I fixture.\nIreland won the first two ODIs of the tour, taking an unassailable lead in the series, and their first series win at home against a Full Member side. It was Ireland's first ODI series win at home since beating Scotland in September 2014. Ireland won the third match by six wickets to win the series 3–0, their first clean-sweep in ODIs against a Full Member team. The T20I series was tied 1–1, after the first match was washed out."

Pierre Karsmakers from the Netherlands dominated the 1973 500cc national championship, winning seven of 12 AMA Nationals and claimed 17 victories in 36 races overall. Karsmakers is credited with helping raise the level of American motocross by stressing the importance of physical fitness and machine preparation. 1973 marked a turning point in American motocross when Jimmy Weinert became the first American rider to defeat the then-dominant European riders in the Trans-AMA Motocross Series at Lake Whitney Ranch in Texas. His victory showed that the level of American motocross had begun to compare with the level of European motocross.\nAs in the 1973 season, after the season-ending 500cc race on September 9, American riders competing for the AMA national championship continued to accumulate points counting towards the national championship while they competed in the 1973 Trans-AMA motocross series, which began on September 23 and hosted visiting European riders from the Motocross World Championship. Although Karsmakers was a Dutch citizen, he was competing under an AMA license so, he was listed as the \"Top American\" finisher in the Trans-AMA series.\nAfter winning the 1972 250cc national championship on a Yamaha, Gary Jones was hired by Honda to help develop their new Honda CR250M motocross bike for the 1973 season. He did so successfully to win his second consecutive 250cc national title."

The annual tournament determined the conference champion of the Division I Atlantic Coast Conference for college baseball. The tournament champion, North Carolina, received the league's automatic bid to the 2019 NCAA Division I baseball tournament. This was the last of 19 athletic championship events held by the conference in the 2018–19 academic year.\nThe tournament has been held every year but one since 1973, with Clemson winning ten championships, the most all-time. Georgia Tech has won nine championships, and defending champion Florida State has won eight titles since their entry to the league in 1992. Charter league member Duke, along with recent entrants Virginia Tech, Boston College, Pittsburgh, Notre Dame and Louisville have never won the event.\nFormat and seeding.\nThe winner of each seven team division and the top ten other teams based on conference winning percentage, regardless of division, from the conference's regular season were seeded one through twelve. Seeds one and two were awarded to the two division winners. Teams were then divided into four pools of three teams each, with the winners advancing to single elimination bracket for the championship.\nIf a 1–1 tie were to occur among all three teams in a pool, the highest seeded team would have advanced to the semifinals. Because of this, seeds 5–12 must win both pool play games to advance to the single-elimination bracket, and seeds 1–4 must only win the game against the winner of the game between the other two teams in the pool to advance. For example, if the 12 seed beats the 8 seed in the first game, then the winner of the 12 seed versus 1 seed advances, and the 8 seed versus 1 seed game has no effect on which team advances.\nSchedule and results.\nSchedule.\nSource:\nAll–Tournament Team.\nSource:"

        "text": "The 2020 Masters (officially the 2020 Dafabet Masters) was a professional non-ranking snooker tournament that took place at Alexandra Palace in London, England, from 12 to 19 January 2020. It was the 46th staging of the Masters tournament, which was first held in 1975, and the second of three Triple Crown events in the 2019–20 season, following the 2019 UK Championship and preceding the 2020 World Snooker Championship. The event invites the top sixteen players from the snooker world rankings in a knockout tournament. It was organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association and was broadcast by the BBC and Eurosport in Europe.\nJudd Trump was the defending champion, having defeated Ronnie O'Sullivan 10–4 in the final of the previous year's event. Trump lost to Shaun Murphy 3–6 in the first round. O'Sullivan was eligible to compete, but chose not to participate, so his entry was given to Ali Carter, next on the world ranking list. Carter reached the final, where he played Stuart Bingham; recovering from 5–7 behind, Bingham won the final 10–8 to claim his first Masters title. He became the oldest Masters champion at the age of 43 years and 243 days, beating the previous record set by Ray Reardon in 1976; Bingham remained the tournament's oldest winner until 2024, when O'Sullivan won the title aged 48 years and 40 days.\nAs the winner of the event, Bingham received £250,000 from a total prize pool of £725,000. The tournament featured a total of eighteen century breaks; the highest break was a 144 compiled by David Gilbert in the quarter-finals, for which he won £15,000.\nOverview.\nThe Masters is an annual invitational snooker tournament that was first held in 1975, with the top-16 players from the snooker world rankings invited to participate. The 2020 Masters was the second Triple Crown event of the 2019–20 snooker season, following the 2019 UK Championship and preceding the 2020 World Snooker Championship. The tournament was held between 12 and 19 January 2020. The sixteen highest-ranked players according to the world rankings after the UK Championship in December 2019 were invited to the event. Seven-time Masters champion and 2019 runner-up Ronnie O'Sullivan, ranked third, chose not to enter; his place was awarded to Ali Carter, who was ranked 17th prior to the tournament. World Snooker reported that O'Sullivan had pulled out of the event for \"personal reasons\", but he later commented that the reason they had stated was a \"mistake\" and that he had not wished to take part. David Gilbert made his Masters debut at the event.\nThe draw for the tournament was held during the final of the 2019 UK Championship. As in previous years, the top eight seeds were allocated fixed positions in the draw. All matches were played as best-of-11- matches, except for the final which was played over a maximum of 19 frames. The week before the 2020 Masters, organisers World Snooker were re-branded as the \"World Snooker Tour\". In addition to this change, the Triple Crown was renamed the \"Triple Crown Series\", and players who had won all three events in the series wore a crown on their playing waistcoats. The 2020 Masters was the first event to feature these changes in branding. The tournament was sponsored, for the last time, by sports betting company Dafabet.\nPrize fund.\nThe prize fund for the event was £725,000, with the winner receiving £250,000. This was an increase of £125,000 over the previous year's total prize fund and an extra £50,000 for the top prize.\nSummary.\nFirst round.\nThe Masters began on 12 January 2020 with first-round matches played as best-of-11-frames. The 2019 UK champion and eighth seed Ding Junhui took on 15th seed Joe Perry in the opening match. Perry was runner-up in his last appearance at the event in 2017 but had not participated in the intervening two years, whilst Ding had won only three matches at the Masters since winning the event in 2011. Perry took the opening frame, before Ding completed a break of 135 in the second frame, the first century break of the tournament. Perry won frame three and Ding took the fourth to tie the match at 2–2 at the interval. Perry took a 3–2 lead before Ding again equalised at 3–3, but then Perry scored a break of 93 to retake the lead at 4–3. Ding, on a break of 41 and likely to win frame eight, ran out of position allowing Perry to increase his lead to 5–3, winning the match in the next frame. He commented afterwards that \"the interval came at the right time\" for him as his performance improved in the second half of the match.\nThree-time Masters champion and fourth seed Mark Selby played the lowest seed, Ali Carter, in the second first-round match. Carter, 17th in the world rankings, had qualified for the event after world number three Ronnie O'Sullivan had chosen not to participate. Carter won the opening frame, escaping from a with a shot that resulted in him potting a when 8–51 behind. He also won frame two, after requiring two snookers, and was leading 3–1 at the interval. Selby then won three consecutive frames and took the lead for the first time, including a break of 94 in frame six, but Carter responded by taking the next three frames, with breaks of 63 and 68 in the last two, to win the match 6–4.\nThe 2012 Masters champion Neil Robertson played UK Championship runner-up Stephen Maguire. Robertson won the first four frames to lead 4–0 at the interval, and later 5–1, before Maguire took frame seven with a break of 105. During this frame, he played a shot that BBC commentator Steve Davis described as \"the most amazing shot in the history of snooker.\" In attempting to pot a red ball into the top right pocket, Maguire struck the with such force that the red leapt into the air after hitting the back of the pocket and landed on the table. The shot had so much that it rolled back into the pocket; the cue ball jumped the pack of reds, hit the of the right middle pocket and went in the bottom right pocket. Robertson was leading 56–0 in frame eight, but Maguire capitalised on missed shots to win the frame. He also took the next two frames to force a . Robertson gained the first chance in the final frame, but missed a shot on the , allowing Maguire to make a break of 62 and win the match. Maguire was informed afterwards that at the interval following the first four frames, bookmakers had made him 25:1 against winning the match. \nDebutant David Gilbert played 2018 Masters champion Mark Allen. Gilbert won the first frame with a break of 77, and the second with a break of 121. Allen was leading 59–12 in frame three, before Gilbert the table with a break of 58 to clinch the frame, and also took frame four to lead 4–0 at the interval. Allen then won frame five, but Gilbert took the next two frames, including a break of 95, to win the match 6–1. Having missed only eight pots during the entire match, Gilbert commented that his performance was \"probably the best [he had] ever played\".\nDefending champion Judd Trump met 2015 Masters champion Shaun Murphy in the first round. Trump made three century breaks in the first five frames to lead 3–2. The third of these was his 678th century in competitive play, moving him into fourth place in the list of players that have made the most career century breaks. Despite Trump's strong start, Murphy took all of the next four frames to win 6–3, a scoreline that Trump later described as \"flattering\" for Murphy. Two-time champion John Higgins played Barry Hawkins, with Higgins winning the first five frames of the match. Hawkins took frame six with a century break, before Higgins won frame seven to triumph 6–1. Seeded fourth, Higgins was the first higher-ranked player to progress from the first round to the quarter-finals.\nOn 15 January, the final day of the first round, the 2018 runner-up Kyren Wilson played Jack Lisowski, and two-time Masters champion Mark Williams played Stuart Bingham. Lisowski won the opening two frames of the first match, before Wilson took six frames in a row to win 6–2. Wilson later remarked that Lisowski was \"flawless for two frames\", but O'Sullivan commentating for Eurosport said of Lisowski: \"to lose six frames on the bounce, you can't do that. There's something seriously wrong in your game.\" Seeded seventh, Wilson was one of only two higher-ranked players to win in the first round, the other being Higgins on the previous day. During frame five of the match, referee Ben Williams was stung by a wasp when attempting to remove it from the table. The other match was tied 2–2 at the interval; Bingham then won four straight frames, with breaks of 50, 76, 86 and 54, to defeat Williams 6–2.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played on 16 and 17 January as best-of-11-frames. Shaun Murphy played Joe Perry in the first quarter-final match. Murphy won three of the first four frames making three breaks of 50 or more. Perry took frame five, then Murphy won frame six to lead 4–2. On a break of 50 and looking likely to win frame seven, Perry missed a red, allowing Murphy to clear the table for a 5–2 lead, thus winning the match in frame eight.\nAli Carter played John Higgins in the second quarter-final. Carter opened a 4–1 lead, before Higgins compiled a break of 140 to win frame six, and then took frame seven with a break of 73 to move within one frame of his opponent at 3–4 behind. In frame eight, Carter played a to the , which was called as a foul by referee Desislava Bozhilova, who deemed the cue ball not to have made contact with the object ball. Carter, however, believed that the balls had touched and challenged the referee's decision, which was then reversed. Video replays of the event showed that the balls had not actually made contact. Carter won the frame, as well as frame nine, to win the match 6–3.\nDavid Gilbert played Stephen Maguire in the third quarter-final. Gilbert won the first frame with the highest break of the tournament, a 144. He also won the second frame, followed by a break of 91 in the third to lead 3–0. Maguire took frame four, but Gilbert won the next by a single point, also winning frame six by a narrow margin. Maguire won frame seven with a break of 94, falling short of a 101 after playing a foul shot. Gilbert took the next frame to win the match 6–2.\nThe last quarter-final was between Kyren Wilson and Stuart Bingham. Wilson won the opening frame with a 139 , and then established a 4–1 lead. Bingham won frame six with a on the black ball, and took the next two frames to draw level at 4–4.&lt;ref name=\"Bingham/Wilson BBC\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He then won two further frames, making it five in a row, to win the match 6–4.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played on 18 January as best-of-11-frames. The sole remaining former Masters champion, Shaun Murphy, played Ali Carter. The first frame featured a break of 68 from Carter, who later won the frame after some play. Carter won the second frame; Murphy won the third with a break of 105, but Carter won the fourth frame to lead 3–1. Murphy scored his second century of the match, a 110, in frame five. He was on course to make another century in frame six, but a poor shot meant that he finished on only 56, allowing Carter to lead 4–2. Carter looked likely to lead 5–2, requiring three shots to win frame seven, but missed a shot on the , allowing Murphy to clinch the frame. Leading by 30 points with 35 remaining, Carter declined to pot a worth five points, playing a snooker instead. Murphy escaped the snooker and laid a snooker of his own; escaping this snooker, Carter fluked the shot and won the frame. He also took frame nine with a break of 97, to win the match 6–3.\nThe second semi-final was between David Gilbert and Stuart Bingham. Gilbert had yet to defeat Bingham in professional play, having met him on ten previous occasions. Bingham won the first three frames, with a break of 94 in the first, before Gilbert won frame four. Bingham won the next two frames, including a break of 75, to lead 5–1. Gilbert won frame seven, but Bingham took the eighth, including his only century of the tournament, to win the match 6–2. The shot on the red rattled in the bottom right corner, before being fluked into the left corner pocket.\nFinal.\nThe final was played as a best-of-19-frames match over two on 19 January. The two finalists were Ali Carter and Stuart Bingham, both players from Essex. The pair had a 9–8 record of matches won in professional play in favour of Bingham. This was the first time that either player had reached the final of the Masters; ranked 17th in the world, Carter was the first player since Ronnie O'Sullivan in 2014 to appear in the final while ranked outside the world's top 16. The match referee was Brendan Moore. The winner of the match would receive the Paul Hunter Trophy, named after the three-time Masters champion.\nThe first session began at 1:00 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time. Carter won the first frame with a break of 126, before Bingham claimed the next two frames, after missed shots from Carter, to lead 2–1. Carter attempted a maximum break in frame four, potting seven reds and seven blacks, but only scored 56. After Bingham scored 23, Carter clinched the frame to tie the match at 2–2. He also won frame five, which was briefly delayed by a \"whoopee cushion\" device being set off in the crowd. Bingham took the next three frames to develop a 5–3 lead going into the second session.\nOn resumption of the match, Carter won the first two frames to draw level again at 5–5. He also won frame 11 with a break of 95 and frame 12 with a break of 135, to lead 7–5 at the final interval. Bingham then won four consecutive frames, all with breaks of 50-plus, to level at 7–7 before moving into a 9–7 lead, one frame away from victory. Carter took frame 17 with a break of 77, but Bingham won the match 10–8 in the next frame, with a break of 109, his only century of the tournament. Aged 43 years and eight months, Bingham became the oldest winner of the tournament, five months older than the previous holder of this record, Ray Reardon, who had won the Masters title in 1976 aged 43 years and three months. Bingham remained the oldest Masters champion until the 2024 event, when O'Sullivan won the title aged 48.\nTournament draw.\nBelow are the results from the event. Players in bold denote the match winners, and numbers to the left of the player names are the seedings.\nCentury breaks.\nThere was a total of 18 century breaks made during the tournament. Neil Robertson pledged to pay £100 for every century made, plus an additional £5,000, towards New South Wales' wildlife charity NSW Wildlife Information Rescue and Education Service to help recovery from the 2019–20 Australian bushfires.&lt;ref name=\"Robertson/Maguire BBC\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; World Snooker Tour indicated that they would donate the same amount.\nBroadcasting.\nThe tournament was broadcast live in the United Kingdom by BBC Sport, as well as on Eurosport in Europe. Worldwide, the event was covered by China Central Television and Superstars Online in China and Sky Sports in New Zealand. The event was simulcast in Hong Kong by Now TV with additional commentary; DAZN covered the event across Canada, Brazil and the United States."

        "text": "Cricket 2000 is a Sports video game developed by Krisalis Software and published by EA Sports for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation. It is based on the 1999 Cricket World Cup and was officially licensed by the International Cricket Council.\nGameplay.\n\"Cricket 2000\" allows the player to select four distinctive modes: quick game, friendly, world cup tournament and super 6 tournament. Quick game randomises the two teams and the ground where a match is held, friendly match allows the player to freely choose any of the 12 nations represented in the game, and the world cup and super 6 tournaments have up to 12 human players controlling each country within two groups of six. The AI computer controls the players in the field but the player can dictate where the ball is thrown. Commentary is provided by former players Richie Benaud and David Gower.\nDevelopment.\nBased on the 1999 Cricket World Cup, and officially licensed by the world governing body of cricket, the International Cricket Council, development of \"Cricket 2000\" began in November 1998 by Krisalis Software in the South Yorkshire town of Rotherham who assembled a team of 12 people to work on it. Krisalis developed motion capture footage by analysing more than 500 individual movements of the English cricket players and brothers Adam Hollioake and Ben Hollioake. Benaud was selected as the lead commentator because the developers felt he was the ideal choice for the job and Benaud suggested to them that Gower be approached for his experience and reputation in the cricket world. \"Cricket 2000\" was released by EA Sports for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation in 2000.\nReception.\nIn April 2000, the game was listed fourth in the top ten selling console games by retail company Electronics Boutique. \"Cricket 2000\" received mixed reviews from critics. Aggregate review website GameRankings gave the PlayStation version received 69.00% based on a single review and the PC version 57.00% based upon five reviewers. Jack Scofield of \"The Guardian\" criticised the graphics, calling them \"crude\" and \"wooden\", and the overall gameplay as \"somewhat hit and miss\". \"Birmingham Post\"'s Simon Griffiths however was complimentary of its batting and bowling mechanisms but he was also critical of the batsmen's movements, which he felt were \"unrealistic\". Writing for \"PC Magazine\", Daniel S. Evans recommended the game solely for cricket fans, while \"PC PowerPlay\"'s Christian Read had similar feelings towards it, saying the gameplay remained challenging to arouse interest for a short amount of time. In \"PC Gaming World\", John Houlihan called the game \"probably the premier playable cricket game on the PC today\". \"The Daily Telegraph\"'s reviewer called \"Cricket 2000\" \"a decent enough cricket game\" that provides the player with \"a fair degree of control over shot selection\"."

        "text": "The 1910 Belmont Stakes was the 44th running of the Belmont Stakes. It was the 6th Belmont Stakes held at Belmont Park and was run on May 30. The race drew only two starters and was won by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame jockey James Butwell riding the favorite Sweep. The colt cantered most of the way and won by six lengths with ease, reflected in the slow time of 2:22 flat for the 1 miles on dirt.\nAt age two, Sweep had won the Belmont Futurity Stakes and his performances in 1909 earned him American Champion Two-Year-Old Male Horse. His successes in 2010 earned him the Three-Year-Old Champion nation honors.\nFor jockey Butwell the win was his first in the Belmont with a second coming in the 1917 edition. For another future Hall of Fame inductee, trainer James Rowe won the seventh of his record eight career wins in the Belmont Stakes. Owner James R. Keene's win marked his third Belmont Stakes triumph in four years and a record sixth overall. His record was equaled in 1955 by the Belair Stud Stable.\nThe 1910 Preakness Handicap was run on May 7 and the 1910 Kentucky Derby three days later on May 10. The Belmont was run twenty days after the Derby. The 1919 Belmont Stakes marked the first time the race was recognized as the third leg of a U.S. Triple Crown series.\nAs a result of New York State's Hart–Agnew anti-betting legislation, which contained penalties allowing for fines and up to a year in prison, racing ended in 1910. For the next two years racetracks in New York were closed. The Belmont Stakes would not be run again until 1913."

The following year, Thompson was a member of the Easts side which reached the grand final but lost to Western Suburbs 15-12. In 1935, Thompson switched clubs and joined arch rivals South Sydney. In his first year at the club, Thompson played for Souths in the grand final against Eastern Suburbs and was on the losing side yet again. In 1939, Thompson was a member of the Souths side which reached the grand final against Balmain but suffered a heavy 33-4 loss at the Sydney Cricket Ground. This would be the last time Thompson played a first grade match. Thompson had a unique playing career in which he was the only player to have played in finals games for and against both Souths and Eastern Suburbs until Luke Keary matched this record in 2018."

        "title": "1957–58 Denver Pioneers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1957–58 Denver Pioneers men's ice hockey team represented University of Denver in college ice hockey. In its 2nd year under head coach Murray Armstrong the team compiled a 24–10–2 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the first time. The Pioneers defeated North Dakota 6–2 in the championship game at the Williams Arena in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the first national title not held at the Broadmoor Ice Palace. Denver became the first team to win its inaugural championship appearance since Michigan in 1948, the first time the tournament was held.\nSeason.\nWhen Murray Armstrong Arrived in 1956, the fairly new program at Denver had been declining for several years. This trend continued in Armstrong's first season when the Pioneers posted a losing record for the first time since their inaugural campaign. During that year, however, Armstrong brought in 9 recruits from Canada who played on the Freshman team before hitting the ice with the varsity squad in 1957–58. Among those players were Murray Massier, Jim Brown and future NHL-er John MacMillan. With those three forwards leading the way on offense Denver jumped out to an impressive start with 2-win weekends over Toronto, Michigan, Michigan State and Michigan Tech. Only arch-rival Colorado College was able to dent their record early-on, winning once in the first of four home-and-home series for the season. Denver suffered its first home loss on New Year's Day against Minnesota but won the rematch two days later to remain high in the conference standings with an 8–2 record.\nAfter taking three points in a series against the US National Team Denver split its second series with CC before welcoming a pair on non-conference teams. The Pioneers defeated the Flin Flon Bombers, a junior team from Manitoba, twice by a combined score of 14–2 then utterly dominated Rensselaer 20–3 in the first game of a 2-game sweep. At the end of January Denver hit the road for a compressed road trip where they would play Minnesota and North Dakota twice each in the span of a week. That scheduling quirk turned out very badly for the Pioneers who lost all four games and dropped back to the rest of the pack with a 9–7 record, though they still held on to first place.\nThe Pioneers returned home to host two Canadian junior teams over a 10-day period, winning three times and tying once. During that two-week period Colorado College swept a series against North Dakota to jump up in the WIHL standings and claim a tie for the top spot with 14 points. That came just in time for the start to a four-game series between the two teams that could decide the second western qualifier for the NCAA Tournament. Each team would play two home games with CC winning the opening game at home 5–1. Because the teams were scheduled to play 8 times over the course of the season each game was worth only 1/2 point in the conference standings, meaning that Denver only had a possible 1-1/2 points possible remaining between the two teams and with little room for error the Pioneers rallied to take the next two games at home, winning 7–0 and 6–3. With the pioneers up by half a point the teams returned to Colorado Springs where, for the 8th time that season, the home team won. While Denver and CC were busy battling to no decisive effect, North Dakota had swept back-to-back weekends against Michigan State and Michigan Tech to put all three team in a tie for first in the WIHL.\nEntering the final week of the season two of the three would be selected to play in the NCAA Tournament with 4th-place Minnesota too far behind to move up in the standings. While Denver was hosting North Dakota, Colorado College went on the road to face Minnesota. Denver took the first game against the Fighting Sioux while CC fell to the Golden Gophers 5–7. Even with a 1-point advantage it was still possible for both other teams to pass Denver in the standings so when the Pioneers were defeated by North Dakota for only their second home loss of the season they slipped to the #2 spot because UND had won 3 of the four matches between the two on the season. CC, meanwhile, had dueled Minnesota to a 1–1 tie in regulation but the tigers had to have a victory if they wanted a chance to defend their national title. However it was the Gophers who were able to earn the overtime marker and end the Tigers' season.\nDenver went to Minnesota to play in their first national tournament, the first championship held outside of the state of Colorado. They were met in the first game by Tri-State League champion Clarkson who had limited opponents to 40 goals in their 18 games while averaging 4.5 goals per game. While Denver was making their national debut the 16-2 Golden Knights had finished 3rd in the previous tournament and were looking to build on an already stellar season. In the semifinal game, however, Clarkson was unable to hold back the Denver attack and surrendered 6 goals, the most they had allowed all season. Denver advanced to the title game to face North Dakota for the fifth time that season after the Fighting Sioux easily dispatched Harvard 9–1.\nDespite the two teams' familiarity with one another the game started a bit slowly with UND's Ed Thomlinson scoring the only goal of the first period. It took more than seven minutes into the second before Denver was able to even the score at 1–1 but once they got onto the scoresheet the floodgates opened and the Pioneers scored twice more in less than four minutes. North Dakota regained their footing and held Denver back for the remainder of the period. With a 3–1 Denver advantage entering the third period the Pioneers pulled back and tried to protect their lead but just over five minutes in the lead was halved by Joe Poole who found himself open in front of the net. Murray Massier quickly responded with his 21st goal of the season to regain the 2-goal edge and while there was still plenty of time left the Massier marker appeared to sap the life out of the Fighting Sioux. While Denver only managed 5 shots in the final frame UND was limited to the same amount. To make matters worse North Dakota netminder Robert Peabody allowed three goals on those five shots to end the UND season on a whimper.\nMassier was named tournament MOP and was joined by Jim Brown, Ed Zemrau and Rodney Schneck on the All-Tournament first team while Blair Livingstone, Barry Sharp and John MacMillan earned All-Tournament second team honors.\nSenior Captain Ed Zemrau was the only Pioneer named to the AHCA All-American West Team and was named to the All-WIHL First Team while Massier made the WIHL second team.\nBecause the WIHL would be dissolved that summer due to a dispute over recruiting practices, Denver's first WIHL title was the last that would ever be awarded. This also made the '58 Denver team the last WIHL squad to win a national championship.\nSchedule.\nConference games against Minnesota and North Dakota were only worth 1 point in the standings. Conference games against Colorado College were only worth 1/2 point in the standings.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | "

        "title": "1998 Winter Olympics opening ceremony",
        "text": "The opening ceremony of the 1998 Winter Olympics took place at Nagano Olympic Stadium, Nagano, Japan, on 7 February 1998. It began at 11:00 JST and finished at approximately 14:00 JST. As mandated by the Olympic Charter, the proceedings combined the formal and ceremonial opening of this international sporting event, including welcoming speeches, hoisting of the flags and the parade of athletes, with an artistic spectacle to showcase the host nation's culture and history. The Games were officially opened by Emperor of Japan Akihito.\nAlan Tomlinson, Professor in Leisure Studies at the University of Brighton, argued that the main theme of this opening ceremony is \"Peace and Harmony\". While elements of Nagano's religious and sporting culture are shown throughout the ceremony, it is shown alongside examples of a hopeful wish in a world peace at the end of the 20th century.\nProceedings.\nBell to Symbolize Purification.\nAt exactly 11am JST, a bell at Zenkō-ji temple was rung, by a man who was a teenager during World War II, and was in training to be a kamikaze pilot when the war ended. The bell that was rung was cast in 1667, and reverberates as a symbol of Nagano. It was rung to confer blessing on the opening ceremony.\nRaising of Onbashira to Consecrate Sacred Ground.\nOnbashira — or \"sacred pillars\" in the Japanese — are large wooden fir posts which stand at the corners of local shrines in Nagano Prefecture. They are brought down from the surrounding mountains to purify the earth. At this ceremony, hundreds of people performed the Satobiki ceremony, where four 12 meter high onbashira are erected at the two entrances of the stadium. The logs are raised with ropes by hand, and while they are being raised, a ceremonial group of log bearers ride the logs and sing and perform other feats, while numerous men and women sustain a consistent chant. Barry Davies — the commentator for the BBC broadcast showing stated that the chants were \"plaintive\" being a \"prelude to much hard work.\" Finally, each post unfurled a yellow steamer which were to call the gods that lived in the trees.\nDohyo-iri Ceremony.\n33 Sumo Wrestlers chosen from all over Japan entered the stadium to perform the \"Dohyō-iri\" ring purification ceremony, which while practiced in the Edo Period, it is one that can be traceable back to an 8th century text. Then Yokozuna Akebono Tarō, eight-time Sumo Grand Champion, and 38 other wrestlers also enter the stadium, totaling the 72 wrestlers. \nDuring this act, it was announced on the Stadium loudspeakers that the Emperor of Japan Akihito, and his wife, Empress Michiko arrive with IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch and other dignitaries. \nThen Akebono performed the \"Yokozuna dohyo-iri\" ring purification ceremony, the symbolic calling of the attention of the gods and expelling the evil spirits from the competition venue. It is more intricate than the normal \"dohyo-iri\" ceremony.\nChildren of Nagano Welcome the Athletes.\nGiant straw Dōsojin, which appear in Shinto folklore in Ōoka village arrive in the stadium. 150 primary school aged children, local participants of the \"One School, One Country\" initiative, arrive dressed as Yukinko, traditional straw winter coats and hats. After some dancing, the children take off their straw coats, showing knitted sweaters of country flags representing the 72 nations competing in these Winter Games. Each child will march with their country during the Parade of Nations, and will appear also during the lighting of the Olympic Flame. \nJapanese artist Ryoko Moriyama joined the school children to perform a medley of two songs from the 1996 Andrew Lloyd Webber/Jim Steinman musical \"Whistle Down the Wind\": the titular song and “When Children Rule the World”, sung in both Japanese and English.\nParade of Nations.\n2,302 athletes from 72 countries and regions participated in the competition, including 814 female athletes and 1488 male athletes. Both the number of participating delegations and the number of athletes participating in the competition were the most ever at the time.Three National Olympic Committees were sending delegations to compete in the Winter Olympics for the first time in history: Azerbaijan, North Macedonia and Uruguay.\nOpening Addresses.\nNAOC President Eishiro Saito delivered a speech in Japanese, welcoming everyone. IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch delivered a speech in English, calling for athletes to \"observe the Olympic truce.\" His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Japan Akihito declared the games open in Japanese.\nOlympic Flag and Anthems.\nAfter a fanfare, the Olympic Flag was carried around the stadium by eight former Japanese Olympians: Chiharu Igaya, Yukio Kasaya, Akitsugu Konno, Yoshihiro Kitazawa, Hatsue Nagakubo-Takamizawa, Yuko Otaka, Seiko Hashimoto, and Hiromi Yamamoto. During the raising of the Olympic flag, the Olympic Hymn was sung in Japanese by the Nagano Children's Choir.\nThe Japanese National Anthem, Kimigayo, was played by Gagaku musicians.\nTorch relay and the lighting of the Olympic cauldron.\nAt the end of a 49-day torch relay across Japan, the Olympic flame is carried into the stadium by Chris Moon, an Landmine Survivors Network member and an activist and advocate for banning anti-personnel landmines. He is accompanied by the local Nagano children featured earlier wearing their flag sweaters. There is also a reprise of the theme song, \"When Children Rule the World\". Moon hands over the Olympic torch to Masako Chiba, bronze medalist for the Women's 10,000 metres at the 1997 World Championships in Athletics in Athens,Chiba presented the Olympic Flame to the Imperial Couple in the royal box, with the Emperor and Empress applauding her. \nChiba passed the torch to Japanese Team that was the current Olympic Champions on Team Event in Nordic Combined: Takanori Kono, Masashi Abe, and Reiichi Mikata, then they passed for the runner Hiromi Suzuki, winner of the Women's marathon at the 1997 World Championships in Athletics who runs upstairs while surrounded by local Nagano children. The last torchbearer was Midori Ito, Olympic silver medalist of the Ladies' singles at the Figure skating at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, and the first asian figure skating to won the World Championiships in 1989, who lighted the cauldron.Ito was wearing a special kimono personifying the Japanese goddess Amaterasu. The music played during this sequence is Un bel dì, vedremo aria from the opera Giacomo Puccini's \"Madame Butterfly\".\nOlympic Oaths and Dove Balloons.\nJapanese men's Nordic combined skier Kenji Ogiwara took the oath on behalf of all 1998 Olympic athletes in Japanese, while the officials' oath was taken by figure skating referee Junko Hiramatsu in Japanese.\n1,998 balloons in the shape of doves were released from the stage of the stadium. \nThe Grand Chorus.\nThe finale of the opening ceremony featured a choral performance of the 4th movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 (\"Ode to Joy\"), conducted by Ozawa Seiji, joined by choruses from the five satellite locations in Beijing, Berlin, Cape Town, New York City, and Sydney; \"The New York Times\" described the sequence as having been \"the first time that images and sounds from around the globe were united in a simultaneous live performance.\"\nPerformers.\nNagano Prefectural Culture Hall: Ozawa Seiji, Tokyo Opera Singers, Nagano Winter Orchestra. Sopranos: Izabela Labuda, Claudia Waite, Altos: Zheng Cao, Ruth Peel, Tenors: Anthony Dean Griffey, Gwyn Hughes Jones, Baritones: Denis Sedov, Kevin Short.\nFollowing the performance of Ode to Joy, a flyover was done by the Japan Air Self-Defense Force performance squadron Blue Impulse, leaving smoke trails in the colors of the Olympic Rings behind them as they flew over the Olympic Stadium.\nLegacy.\nAlan Tomlinson, argues that \"Peace and Harmony\" is this opening ceremony's theme. While elements of Nagano's culture are shown throughout the ceremony, the main theme shown is how the world is more unified and harmonious at the last Winter Olympics of the 20th century. This is best seen in the massed choir that marked the beginning and the end of this ceremony, with satellite choirs at key symbolic locations of peace. It is also seen through at the flame's entrance by emphasizing the work of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. \nSince the 2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, the theme of universalism bringing peace in Olympics opening ceremonies have been dropped for more nationalistic displays, as seen in the 2002 Winter Olympics opening ceremony."

The competition was seen as the Southern Hemisphere equivalent of the World Indoor Bowls Championships held annually in the United Kingdom and organised by the World Bowls Tour.\nThe event was first held from 3-10 April 2005, at the Hong Kong Football Club indoor bowling green and Ap Lei Chau Sports Centre in Hong Kong but eventually took place every year at the Warilla Bowls Club in New South Wales, Australia. \nAlthough players from both hemispheres were able to compete, travelling restricted the entries and the majority of the leading indoor players from the Northern hemisphere did not take part.\nIn 2019, World Bowls came to an agreement with the International Indoor Bowls Council (IIBC), formerly the WIBC. The agreement was to merge their two international indoor championships, the World Cup Singles and the IIBC Championships.

        "text": "John Patrick Schneider (born February 14, 1980) is an American professional baseball coach who is the manager of the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB). He became a coach for the Blue Jays in 2019 and became interim manager on July 13, 2022. After the 2022 season, the Blue Jays hired him as their permanent manager. Prior to coaching, Schneider played six seasons as a catcher in the Blue Jays minor league organization.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in Princeton, New Jersey and raised in Lawrence Township, Mercer County, New Jersey, Schneider graduated from Lawrence High School in 1998. He attended the University of Delaware and played college baseball for the Fightin' Blue Hens. In three seasons, he batted .306 with 23 home runs and 139 runs batted in (RBIs). In 2001, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Schneider was selected by the Detroit Tigers in the 24th round of the 2001 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign, and was chosen by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 13th round of the 2002 draft. He was assigned to the Short Season-A Auburn Doubledays for the 2002 season, and hit .240 with two home runs and 11 RBIs. The following year, Schneider played for the Class-A Charleston AlleyCats and the Triple-A Syracuse SkyChiefs, and batted .188 with 14 RBIs in 59 games.\nSchneider played the entire 2004 season with the Advanced-A Dunedin Blue Jays, appearing in 58 games and batting .206 with six home runs and 28 RBIs. With Dunedin in 2005, he hit .321 in 22 games and was promoted back to Triple-A Syracuse, but struggled to a .179 average through 34 games with the SkyChiefs. Schneider played at three different minor league levels in 2006, including the New Hampshire Fisher Cats, but was limited to 34 games due to back surgery. He retired after the 2007 minor league season, due to three concussions suffered during the season.\nCoaching/Managerial career.\nAfter retiring as a player, Schneider was hired by the Blue Jays organization as a catching instructor. In 2008, he became the manager of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League Blue Jays. Schneider was promoted to manage the Short Season-A Vancouver Canadians on December 1, 2010, and became the youngest manager in team history at 30 years of age. In 2011, he managed the Canadians, but took a personal leave of absence during the season. Vancouver won the league's championship in 2011. Schneider returned to the Gulf Coast League in 2013, and then went back to managing Vancouver in 2014 and 2015. In 2016, he managed the Class-A Lansing Lugnuts, and in 2017, won the first Florida State League championship in the 33-year history of the Dunedin Blue Jays. On January 10, 2018, Schneider was promoted to manage the New Hampshire Fisher Cats, and led the team to an Eastern League championship. At the end of the season, he was named the Eastern League Manager of the Year.\nThe Blue Jays promoted Schneider to their major league coaching staff before the 2019 season to work with Blue Jays catchers. He pitched to Vladimir Guerrero Jr. during the 2019 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby. The Blue Jays promoted Schneider to become their bench coach for the 2022 season.\nOn July 13, 2022, the Blue Jays fired Charlie Montoyo as their manager and named Schneider their interim manager for the remainder of the season. He won his first game as manager that night. Schneider led the Blue Jays to a record and to the 2022 American League Wild Card Series as the Blue Jays manager in 2022. On October 21, 2022, the Blue Jays hired Schneider as their full-time manager, and signed him to a three-year contract with an option for a fourth season.\nPersonal life.\nSchneider has two siblings. His older brother Matt played basketball for Muhlenberg University. His younger brother Kevin played baseball at Monmouth University. His parents David &amp; Cathy live in New Jersey.\nSchneider married his wife Jessy in 2015. They have two sons; Gunner, born in 2016, and Grayson, born in 2018."

The qualifying structure is designed to reduce more than 2,500 entrants on five continents, to a field size of 156 competing in the tournament.\nIn the modern era, the main way players qualify is by an exemption due to their performance in major golf tours, major tournaments, or their position in the official world golf rankings. For those who are not exempt, they can qualify by performing well in the Open Qualifying Series of international sanctioned tournaments, or via local qualifying in the UK.\nThe format of the final tournament was originally 36 holes played on a single day, but has evolved to the current format of four days of 18 holes, with the lowest scoring golfers cut after the first 36 holes.\nCurrent qualifying process.\nPlayers can qualify one of four ways, an exemption, via the Open Qualifying Series (OQS), via local qualifying, or if the field size has not reached 156, being one of the highest rated players in the official golf rankings that is not already qualified.\nExemption qualifiers.\nAround 65% of the field is exempt from qualifying. Not all those eligible for entry will compete (e.g. older previous Open winners, and injured players).\nThe current criteria for an exemption is governed by the following rules:\nOpen Qualifying Series.\nAround 22% of the field qualify via the Open Qualifying Series. It was introduced in 2014 and replaced international qualifying events run by the Open. Qualifying is available to the leading players (not otherwise exempt) who finish in the top \"n\" and ties, in around twelve events run by several international golf tours. The Open Series Qualifying events since 2019 are:\n\"Note: 2021 tournament criteria affected by COVID-19\"\nLocal and Final qualifying.\nCurrently 12 players (8% of the field) qualify through final qualifying in the United Kingdom.\nLocal Qualifying.\nLocal qualifying begins with 13 events, of 36 holes occurring on a single day just over three weeks before the Open Championship. It is open to those who meet any of the following criteria:\nA week later, the best performers then progress to final qualifying, where there are four events of 36 holes occurring on a single day, with three qualifiers from each event.\nFinal Qualifying.\nIn addition to the best performers at local qualifying, players who meet the following criteria are able to compete in final qualifying:\n\"Note: Any qualifier via an amateur performance must still have amateur status\"\nAlternates.\nIf the field size has not reached 156, then the highest ranked players not already qualified are offered a spot in the Open.\nHistory of qualification and format.\nQualifying was first introduced from 1907, except 1910–1911, where a 36 hole cut was made instead. 1926 was the first year where there was both a cut and qualifying, and this has been the situation ever since. Qualifying generally happened the day before or shortly before the Open, and everyone was required to qualify until 1962. In 1963 exemptions from qualification began, mainly for past champions, but this has now expanded to cover a multitude of achievements and most of the field now qualify by exemption. In the 1980s, the R&amp;A was concerned that its process was not adequately allowing for players which played on multiple tours, and so actively brought about what is now known as the Official World Golf Ranking to use as part of the exemption process.\nIn 2004 international qualifying was introduced, which meant that players did not have to travel to the UK to participate in qualifying. This was replaced in 2014 by the Open Qualifying Series, which gave qualifying spots to the best performers in existing global golf events.\nThe biggest change to the format of the tournament was in 1892 when the tournament was expanded from 36 holes to 72 holes. Another notable change in the rules was making it mandatory to use the \"bigger\" ball (as was used in America) in 1974."

        "title": "1959–60 Denver Pioneers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1959–60 Denver Pioneers men's ice hockey team represented University of Denver in college ice hockey. In its 4th year under head coach Murray Armstrong the team compiled a 27–4–3 record and reached the NCAA tournament for the second time. The Pioneers defeated Michigan Tech 5–3 in the championship game at the Boston Arena in Boston, Massachusetts. Denver set a record for the most wins by a team in one season, breaking the previous high of 25 set by Colorado College in 1956–57.\nSeason.\nAfter Denver was left out of the 1959 NCAA Tournament despite having the best record of any NCAA team at 22-5-1, the Pioneers knew they had to make changes. First, the argument between Denver and Minnesota over recruiting practices (teenage Americans vs. overage Canadians) was not settled but was put to the side. As part of a compromise between the two Minnesota would agree to rejoin with the 4 former WIHL schools so long as they did not have to schedule Denver during the season. The deal was eventually struck where they would play the Pioneers during the 1959–60 season but were not required to afterwards (Minnesota would not play Denver outside of playoff meetings until 1972). That settlement allowed all seven schools to rejoin in the new WCHA which improved upon the previous conference principally by introducing the first official conference tournament in college hockey history. The second improvement came from counting all league games equally in the standings; rather than have a total of four points available between each pair of teams. The WCHA sorted their unbalanced schedule based on winning percentage.\nBeing in a conference once more also settled the second problem Denver had faced the year before; playing away games. Denver had only once left Colorado the year before and lost both games on the road. For 1959–60 they began the season with a compressed road trip where they played six games over a nine-day period. The trip started out well with Denver tying Minnesota 4–4 in the team's only overtime game all season before winning the following night. Two days later they were hosted by Michigan Tech and dropped both games to a very strong team. With no time to lick their wounds the Pioneers got one day off to travel to North Dakota and take on the defending national champion Fighting Sioux. The Pioneers redeemed themselves by winning both games comfortably and pulling back above .500.\nAfter a 9-day break Denver opened its home schedule and thoroughly dominated the previous year's runner-up Michigan State by a combined score of 21-1. Those two games could have set the tone for the rest of Denver's season but the very next week they invited Michigan Tech to Denver and after winning the first game easily they lost their third game of the year to the Huskies and slipped to 6–3–1 in the WCHA. Similar to their last series against MTU, Denver got one day off before hosting Minnesota and avenged their loss with two 5-goal wins over the Golden Gophers. After winning two games against a visiting senior team Denver ended the first half of their conference schedule by splitting a pair of games against North Dakota. Denver found themselves sitting atop the WCHA at the end of January with a 9-4-1 record and were in prime position to earn the top seed in the WCHA tournament.\nDenver began February playing a series of games against several national teams who were preparing to play in the Olympics at the end of the month along with Colorado College. After starting with a non-conference win over CC Denver defeated the eventual gold medalist US National Team and then tied them the following day. Two days later they tied the powerhouse Soviet National Team before defeating both West Germany and Sweden.\nOnce the Olympics began Denver returned to its conference schedule, winning both games of a home-and-home against Colorado College before hitting the road for a second time. On this trip they ended up playing two series in five days against Michigan and Michigan State and won all four games. After returning home and winning a second series against the CC Tigers Denver ended with a 23-4-3 record and won the inaugural WCHA championship.\nDenver received the top seed in the WCHA Tournament which, rather than acting as a traditional tournament, had two 2-game series played between the top four teams to determine the two WCHA co-champions. The two series were total goal affairs rather than being best-of contests so when Denver opened against Colorado College with a 9–2 victory they would have to lose the succeeding game by 8 goals to miss out on the NCAA tournament. Unsurprisingly it was a much more defensive effort from the regular season champions and the Pioneers scored only three times on the night but was still able win the game and were joined by Michigan Tech as the inaugural WCHA Tournament co-champions.\nAs the better of the two teams Denver was given the top western seed in the NCAA tournament and opened against Boston University who were playing in their home building. Despite the mostly partisan crowd rooting them on, BU was unable to overcome the best offense in the nation and surrendered six goals to Denver who advanced to their second championship game. Denver was met in the final by their nemesis Michigan Tech and began the game at a conservative pace. Denver scored the first goal of the game just after the 10-minute mark and took another 22 minutes before the got their second. With the Pioneers holding a 2-0 advantage the Huskies came to life at the end of the second and scored three times in under five minutes to take their first lead of the game. After George Konik tied the game two and a half minutes into the third Denver was able to quell the MTU offense for the remainder of the period, holding the Huskies to only six shots. The Pioneers continued firing the puck at George Cuculick and with just over a minutes to go in regulation team captain John MacMillan scored the winning goal in his final college game. Just for good measure he added an empty-net goal 50 seconds later that sealed the game for Denver and sent the Pioneers to the top of the podium for the second time.\nBecause the entire tournament had been played fairly evenly the voters could not decide on one person to win the MOP so for the first (and only as of 2018) time the award was split, going to three players but none of whom belonged to the national champion. Instead Denver had to settle for only two of the six spots on the All-Tournament first team in the form of Marty Howe and George Konik while John MacMillan and goaltender George Kirkwood were placed on the second team.\nHowe, Konik and Bill Masterton were named to the AHCA All-American West Team while Kirkwood, Howe and Masterton received All-WCHA First Team nods. While Konik and MacMillan found themselves on the WCHA second team Kirkwood was named as the top sophomore in the WCHA (along with MTU's Lou Angotti) and set the record for more wins a season by a goaltender with 27.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | \nNotes.\nAfter graduating in 1960, John MacMillan was signed by the Toronto Maple Leafs and became the first Denver alumnus to play in the NHL. Though his career was short he would end up winning two Stanley cups. several years after MacMillan's retirement George Konik and Bill Masterton would make their NHL debuts in the 1967–68 season. While Konik would play 51 games for Pittsburgh before returning to the minors, Masterton became the only player in the history of professional North American sports to die as a direct result of injuries sustained in a game."

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Washington Nationals.\nCareer.\nWashington Nationals.\nBourque attended Huron High School in Ann Arbor, Michigan and played college baseball at the University of Michigan. He was drafted by the Washington Nationals in the 14th round of the 2014 Major League Baseball draft. He spent his first professional season with the Gulf Coast Nationals and Low-A Auburn Doubledays. Bourque missed the 2015 season after undergoing Tommy John surgery. \nBourque returned to action in 2016 with the Single–A Hagerstown Suns. In 17 games (13 starts), he logged a 5–6 record and 5.03 ERA with 55 strikeouts in 68.0 innings of work.

On November 19, 2018, the Nationals added Bourque to their 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft.\nAfter Bourque pitched to a 1.33 ERA through 14 games with Double-A Harrisburg, the Nationals called him up on May 25, 2019, to replace Joe Ross in the bullpen. He made his major league debut the following game, pitching in the ninth inning against the Miami Marlins. On May 29, Bourque was optioned to the Triple-A Fresno Grizzlies and spent the rest of the season there, going 4–1 with a 5.56 ERA over 43.2 innings.\nIn 2020, Bourque made six major league appearances for Washington, recording a 6.75 ERA with only one strikeout in four innings of work. He missed the latter part of the season due to an elbow strain, and was removed from the 40-man roster and sent outright to Triple–A on October 13, 2020. He became a free agent on November 2.\nChicago Cubs.\nOn December 18, 2020, Bourque signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs organization. He missed the entire 2021 season due to injury, and made only 7 appearances for the Triple-A Iowa Cubs in 2022, logging a 3.24 ERA with 16 strikeouts in innings pitched. Bourque elected free agency following the season on November 10, 2022.\nSan Diego Padres.\nOn May 17, 2023, Bourque signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres organization. In 11 games for the Double–A San Antonio Missions, he recorded a 3.46 ERA with 18 strikeouts in 13.0 innings of work. On July 25, Bourque was released by San Diego."

        "text": "The England cricket team toured New Zealand between October and December 2019 to play two Tests and five Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. New Zealand Cricket confirmed the fixtures for the tour in June 2019. The Bay Oval hosted its first ever Test match, becoming the ninth Test venue in the country.\nThe Test matches were not part of the 2019–21 ICC World Test Championship (WTC), as the tour was confirmed prior to the formation of the WTC. Ashley Giles, the managing director of England men's cricket, suggested that the tour could have a stand-in captain and coach. However, when the squads were announced in September 2019, Joe Root and Eoin Morgan were retained as the captains of England's Test and T20I teams respectively, but Jonny Bairstow was dropped from the Test squad. Sam Billings was named as the vice-captain of England's T20I squad. In November 2019, Bairstow was added to England's Test squad, as cover for Joe Denly.\nKane Williamson was ruled out of T20I series due to a hip injury, with Tim Southee named as New Zealand's captain. New Zealand's Trent Boult was rested for the first three T20Is, in order to focus on his Test preparations.\nThe final T20I finished in a tie, with the match decided by a Super Over. England won the Super Over to win the T20I series 3–2. In the Test series, New Zealand won the first match by an innings and 65 runs. This stretched New Zealand's unbeaten run at home in Tests to ten matches, going back to March 2017, which includes wins in seven of those fixtures. New Zealand won the two-match Test series 1–0, after the second Test was drawn.\nSquads.\nIn New Zealand's T20I squad, Lockie Ferguson was selected for the first three matches, and Trent Boult was selected for the last two matches. Ahead of the second T20I, Joe Denly was ruled out of England's squad for the rest of the T20I series due to an ankle injury. Jonny Bairstow was added to England's Test squad as cover for Denly. Ahead of the first Test, Lockie Ferguson and Todd Astle were released from the New Zealand squad to participate in the Ford Trophy. Ahead of the second Test, both Trent Boult and Colin de Grandhomme were ruled out of New Zealand's squad due to injury. Daryl Mitchell was called up as cover for de Grandhomme, with Lockie Ferguson and Todd Astle also rejoining the New Zealand squad for the second Test."

Though many of its earliest schools departed in the 1920s to form the Southern Conference, and later the Southeastern Conference and Atlantic Coast Conference, it existed until 1942. \nThe first post-season college conference basketball tournament was staged in 1921 by the SIAA. In 1922 and 1923, the SIAA and SoCon shared a common tournament. Western Kentucky under Edgar Diddle won the last 6 tournaments, with 3 led by center Carlisle Towery. In 1947 there was an attempt, led by Western Kentucky, to revive the SIAA. Western Kentucky hosted an SIAA basketball tournament that turned out to be little more than an invitational tournament because most former SIAA members declined to participate.\nBasketball was invented by James Naismith in 1891. It seemed to take off in the South in 1906-07, when Yale's basketball team traveled throughout the South. In 1909, continuous dribbling and shots off the dribble was allowed.\nChampions by year.\n\"This is an incomplete list of champions of the SIAA.\""

        "text": "Guillermo Enrique Martínez (born October 5, 1984) is the hitting coach of the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB). Prior to his coaching career, he spent several seasons as a shortstop in the Florida Marlins organization.\nProfessional career.\nMartínez was selected in the 17th round of the 2003 Major League Baseball draft by the Chicago White Sox, but did not sign and then attended the University of South Alabama. In the 2006 draft, the Florida Marlins selected him in the 15th round. Martínez appeared in 36 games for the Short Season-A Jamestown Jammers in 2006, batting .193 with 11 runs batted in (RBI). In 2007 he played for the Class-A Greensboro Grasshoppers and the Advanced-A Jupiter Hammerheads, and hit a combined .260 with one home run and seven RBI in 48 games. Martínez played his final season with the Marlins organization in 2008, hitting .201 in 61 games for Jupiter.\nIn 2009, Martínez hit .304 with three home runs, 31 RBI, and 28 stolen bases for the Windy City ThunderBolts of the independent Frontier League. He split the 2010 season with the ThunderBolts and the Lake County Fielders of the Northern League, and played his final season of professional baseball with the American Association's Grand Prairie AirHogs in 2011.\nCoaching.\nIn 2012, Martínez was hired by the Toronto Blue Jays as a minor league hitting and infield coach. On November 16, 2018, he was promoted to the position of hitting coach at the major league level, replacing Brook Jacoby. Guillermo Martinez was ejected prior to the Blue Jays game June 22, 2022 against the Chicago White Sox following a heated lineup card exchange that stemmed from an issue from the June 21 game. While exchanging lineup cards, Martinez confronted home plate umpire Doug Eddings about questionable calls made during the previous game. On June 24, 2022, MLB suspended Martinez five games for making contact with Eddings and \"for his unsportsmanlike conduct during the pregame lineup card exchange.\" Martinez was also fined an undisclosed amount."

        "text": "Cycling at the 2020 Summer Paralympics took place in two separate locations. Track cycling took place at the Izu Velodrome from 25 to 28 August 2021 and road cycling took place on the Fuji Speedway from 31 August to 3 September 2021.\nThe 2020 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games were postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They kept the 2020 name and were held from 24 August to 5 September 2021.\nThe competition was dominated by the squads from Great Britain and The Netherlands, winning 19 gold medals from 51 events. Great Britain, as in 2008, 2012 and 2016 dominated the track events, while the Netherlands were particularly strong in road racing.\nAmong the highlights were Great Britain's Sarah Storey becoming her country's most successful ever Paralympian, echoing the achievement of Jason Kenny in the 2020 Summer Olympics, winning her 15th, 16th and 17th gold medals in her eighth Paralympic Games.\nClassification.\nCyclists are given a classification depending on the type and extent of their disability. This method is known as a functional system and was introduced in 2012. Athletes are classified according to their functional ability across four broad categories (blind or partially sighted tandem, handcycle, tricycle and standard bicycle). The class number indicates the severity of impairment with \"1\" being most impaired. The classification system allows cyclists to compete against others with a similar level of function.\nRiders with recovering or deteriorating conditions such as MS are eligible but must have been reclassified within six months of a World Championships or Paralympic Games to ensure their classification is correct. Specialised equipment including prostheses is only allowed where it has been specifically approved.\nThis class is for athletes who have visual impairments and therefore ride tandem bicycles with a sighted cyclist (known as a pilot). B1, B2, and B3 athletes compete together in this class.\nThis class is for athletes who are lower limb amputees, have paraplegia, or have involuntary or uncoordinated movement, and ride a handcycle using arms to turn pedals for propulsion. H1–4 cyclists compete in the reclined position, whereas H5 cyclists compete in a kneeling position.\nThis class of athletes compete using a tricycle instead of a bicycle, due to lack of balance, or a restriction in the ability to pedal due to muscle tension, or uncoordinated or involuntary movements.\ntension, uncoordinated movements or involuntary movements.\nThis class is for athletes with a limb deficiency, impaired muscle power or range of motion, and impairments affecting co-ordination, such as uncoordinated and involuntary movements.\nFactored events.\nSome cycling events are factored. This can happen when cyclists from different classes compete against each other and means that the results take into account the severity of the impairments of each competitor. As a result, some riders within an event will have their times ‘factored’ while other riders will not, or will have their time factored in a different calculation. The gold medal goes to the athlete with the fastest time after all the required times have been calculated. It is therefore possible for an athlete to break a paralympic or world record in their event for their specific classification, but to finish behind a differently classified athlete in that event after factoring. In such a case, the record is still treated as an official World, or as the case may be, Paralympic Games record within their classification for that event.\nParticipating nations.\nAs of June 2021"

The competition was held from 20 September to 2 October 1988. 36 boxers from 36 nations competed.\n19-year-old Roy Jones Jr. of the U.S. dominated his opponents, never losing a single round en route to the final. In the final, he controversially lost a 3–2 decision to South Korean fighter Park Si-Hun, four years his senior, despite pummeling Park for three rounds and landing 86 punches to Park's 32.\nResults.\nThe following boxers took part in the event:\nFinal.\nJudges Zaur Gvadzhava of the Soviet Union and Sándor Pajar of Hungary each voted for Jones, 60–56, on the 20-point must system. Alberto Duran of Uruguay and Hiouad Larbi of Morocco voted for Park, each by 59–58. Bob D. Kasule of Uganda gave 59–59 a draw, but decided that Park was more aggressive. As the decision was highly controversial, it eventually led the Olympic authorities to introduce a new high-tech scoring system, which in turn was intended to eliminate biased judging."

(In rugby union, any match of a nation's senior side recognized as a test by its national governing body is included in test statistics for that nation.) Players that were first capped during the same match are listed in order of those that began in the starting line up before replacements and then in alphabetical order by surname. Note that the \"position\" column lists the position at which the player made his test debut and not necessarily the position for which he is best known. A position in parentheses indicates that the player debuted as a substitute.\nMembers of the national rugby union team who have been inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame include the players from the bronze medal-winning team from the 1924 Olympic Games (inducted in 2012)."

        "text": "In the sport of cricket, a knuckle ball (or knuckleball) is a type of delivery employed by a fast bowler, and a type of slower ball. As similar to a slower ball, the bowler's intention is to deceive the batter into playing too early so that they either miss the ball completely or hit it high up in the air to offer an easy catch.\nThe ball is bowled by the bowler positioning the ball underneath the knuckles of their index and middle finger, instead of in the fingers themselves. The delivery deceives the batsman as from a batter's perspective, the ball appears to be a stock delivery. However, when it is released it is slower than expected.\nThe delivery was adopted from baseball’s knuckleball. The physics of the operation are largely the same. However, the seam on a cricket ball is equatorial, and thus the extent of erratic movement is reduced due to the symmetry (at least in the conventional release position where the planes of the ball's trajectory and the seam are nearly co-planar).\nThough Jeetan Sareen developed the knuckle ball for cricket as early as 1989, the Knuckle ball was first introduced to the world stage by India's Zaheer Khan in the 2011 Cricket World Cup . Bowlers who often use the knuckleball include India's Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Shardul Thakur, Sandeep Sharma, Deepak Chahar, New Zealand's Trent Boult and Australia's Andrew Tye. Tye's lethal use of the knuckleball leads to vast success in limited overs competitions, and his eventual selection for Australia. Tye's fame is largely due to his world-renowned use of the knuckleball. Jofra Archer successfully deployed the knuckleball during the 2019 Cricket World Cup and subsequent Ashes Test series against Australia while Trent Boult successfully deployed the knuckleball during the 2023 Cricket World Cup"

Originally, the tour was scheduled to take place in December 2019, but it was moved to avoid clashing with the 2019–20 Bangladesh Premier League tournament.\nOn 11 May 2019, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Nazmul Hasan Papon stated that the Bangladesh team was unlikely to proceed with a planned tour to Sri Lanka in July, citing fears that the country could be hit by another terrorist attack, following the Easter bombings on 21 April 2019. On 27 June 2019, it was reported that four National Security Intelligence (NSI) personnel, the civilian intelligence agency of Bangladesh, were sent to Sri Lanka to assess the situation. On 8 July 2019, Sri Lanka Cricket confirmed that the tour would go ahead, with all three matches played at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.\nFor the series, Sri Lanka named a squad of twenty-two players, which was later trimmed down to the final squad of seventeen. Chief Selector, Ashantha de Mel, said this would allow them to experiment with the line-ups for each match on an individual basis. Prior to the series, Bangladesh's captain Mashrafe Mortaza was ruled out of the tour due to a hamstring injury. Tamim Iqbal was named as captain for the first time in ODIs.\nSri Lankan bowler Lasith Malinga retired from ODIs following the first match of the series in Colombo. He took a wicket with his final ball, finishing his career as the ninth-highest wicket-taker in ODIs, with 338 dismissals. Sri Lanka Cricket announced that the final ODI was dedicated to Sri Lankan bowler Nuwan Kulasekara, who retired from international cricket before the series.\nSri Lanka won the first two ODI matches, therefore taking an unassailable lead and winning the series. It was their first ODI series win at home since beating the West Indies 3–0 in November 2015. Sri Lanka won the third match by 122 runs to win the series 3–0.\nSquads.\nAhead of the series, Mashrafe Mortaza and Mohammad Saifuddin were ruled out of Bangladesh's squad due to injury and were replaced by Farhad Reza and Taskin Ahmed respectively. On 23 July 2019, Shafiul Islam was added to Bangladesh's squad.\nAmila Aponso, Niroshan Dickwella, Danushka Gunathilaka, Lakshan Sandakan, Lahiru Madushanka were named in Sri Lanka's initial twenty-two man squad, but did not make the final seventeen cricketers for the series.\nStatistics.\nMost wickets.\nNew Zealand cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2019"

        "text": "Rugby union in Cornwall (before 1900) is a timeline of rugby union in Cornwall in the 19th century.\nHistory.\nRichard Carew in his \"Survey of Cornwall\" (1602) gives some laws of a game which has similarities to rugby. \nBefore 1900, rugby union in Cornwall was referred to as football and what is known today as football was then called ″association″ or soccer. Before the formation of the Cornwall RFU in 1883, the press did not consistently record rugby matches so it is uncertain when it was first played in Cornwall. The first recorded rugby match in Penzance is from 1870, played in the grounds of Poltair House, Heamoor and organised by W Borlase of Marlborough School. The Penzance team was mostly public schoolboys, home on holiday, and their opponents, the Eastern Telegraph Company was based in Porthcurno. In Penryn, before 1872 a team made up of workers from Freeman's granite yard played a team from Sara's Foundry in a field near the Cross Keys hotel. In the main, rugby was mainly confined to the western half of Cornwall, from Penzance in the west to Truro in the east.\n1894–95.\nCornish Rugby League.\nThe first season of the Cornish Rugby League consisted of five clubs, although one did not have any fixtures with the other competitors! Redruth became champions following their win at Camborne, in what was, the final league match of the season.\n1895–96.\nCounty Championship.\nThe County Championship was reorganised with the fifteen teams divided into three groups. The first-placed teams of the South-eastern and South-western Divisions met in a play-off match, with the winners playing the first-placed team of the Northern Division in the final. Yorkshire won the competition for the seventh time defeating Surrey in the final. This was the third system of the County Championship.\nCornwall lost all three matches, and since their first match in 1892 have lost all eleven matches.\nCornish Rugby League.\nThroughout the season \"The Cornishman\" published a league table of the first two matches between six clubs. Only Penzance and Camborne completed all their fixtures and Truro only played five matches. Penzance was in first place and Redruth in second place.\nAt the end of the season a second table was published, of matches between the top four clubs with Redruth in first place and Penzance in second place. 'Impartial' the rugby reporter declared Redruth ″may fairly again claim the honour of being champions″."

        "text": "Milan–Cortina d'Ampezzo 2026 (; or ) was a successful bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics by the cities of Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo and the Italian National Olympic Committee. The IOC selected Milan-Cortina d'Ampezzo to host the 2026 Winter Olympics at the 134th IOC Session in Lausanne, Switzerland on 24 June 2019.\nHistory.\nConsidered Milan together with Valtellina as suitable candidates. The plan was for Milan to host the ice sports, while the snow sports would take place in Bormio, Santa Caterina di Valfurva and Livigno, which are already well-known destinations for Alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, snowboarding, biathlon, etc.\nOn 10 March 2018, the mayor of Turin, Chiara Appendino, confirmed on her Facebook page that a bid to host the Games on the 20th anniversary of the 2006 Winter Olympics was being explored. She suggested that the bid would introduce a new, revolutionary model for hosting the Games, with sustainability at the forefront. On 17 March, Appendino sent a letter to CONI officially expressing her support, after having resolved an initial split in support amongst fellow council members. The following week, municipal council gave the green light to start the procedure for the establishment of a \"Torino 2026\" association. The not-for-profit entity will have the task of overseeing the analysis and research necessary to evaluate the feasibility of an eventual candidature of Turin to host the Winter Olympics.\nOn 29 March 2018, two days before the deadline for cities to join the dialogue stage, it was confirmed that CONI would bid to host the 2026 Games in Milan and Turin and a letter of intent had been sent to the IOC. The bid is complicated by the fact that the 134th IOC Session is scheduled to be held in Milan in 2019. If an Italian city proceeds to the candidature stage, the venue for the IOC session will need to be changed to a different country.\nA decision on which city leads the potential Italian bid for the 2026 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games will be made on either 1 August or 17 September 2018. On 4 July 2018 the mayor of Turin, Chiara Appendino, announced in a conference the project and the candidacy for \"Turin 2026\", defining the opportunity of a double candidature with Milan \"a chit-chat of the press I haven't seen yet\". On 1 August 2018, CONI confirmed that all bidding cities will bid jointly using existing facilities and presented a proposal for a combined Cortina-Milan-Turin bid to CONI.\nOn 18 September 2018, the CONI announced it will present a bid with Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, excluding Turin after the city withdrew from the bid. On 19 September 2018, Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said the Italian government would support a 2026 Winter Olympics bid. Furthermore, the CONI considered it would accept an eventual return of Turin in the Italian bid.\nOn 1 October 2018, the CONI confirmed the Milan–Cortina d'Ampezzo bid. Italian Government backs the Milan–Cortina bid for the 2026 Olympics, but will not make any financial investment. However, the regions of Lombardy and Veneto will try to finance the Games with private and public investments. On 21 January 2019 the Italian government supported the Milan–Cortina bid to host. On 1 April 2019 The referendum will not be needed because of many Italians support the candidature, 83 percent of Italians backed the bid. Milan–Cortina d'Ampezzo was chosen as host city, it will be the first Olympics to be held in Milan, mark the 20th anniversary of the 2006 Olympics in Turin, the 70th anniversary of the 1956 Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo and the 80th anniversary of the Italian Republic.\nPrevious bids.\nMilan had never hosted the Games; Cortina d'Ampezzo hosted the 1956 Winter Olympics.\nItaly hosted the Games three times and made seventeen bids (nine for Summer Games and seven for the Winter Olympics).\nBranding.\nThe Candidate City logo was unveiled on 27 November 2018 during its presentation at the ANOC General Assembly in Tokyo, Japan. The logo of its candidature the bid logo is a stylised Milan Cathedral with a façade that turns into a mountain, echoing the Alps and the Dolomites. The logo's green, white and red spires reflect the Italian flag, with the design asserted to show the unity between Milan and Cortina.\nThe slogan \"Dreaming Together\" () was unveiled on 1 April 2019. The bid book and website was launched on 11 January 2019.\nDates.\nThe Winter Olympic Games will be from 6 to 22 February 2026 and the Winter Paralympic Games will be from 6 to 15 March 2026."

The Swedish Olympic Committee agreed to conduct a feasibility study on a potential bid for the 2026 Olympics. By December 2017, Stockholm's bid to host the Winter Games was once again active. Events were proposed to be held in Stockholm, Åre, and Falun, and in Sigulda, Latvia. The proposal to include Sigulda was based on the International Olympic Committee's Agenda 2020 initiative to use existing facilities rather than build new ones, and was supported by the Latvian government. On 11 January 2019 Stockholm submitted its bid book, announcing that it was jointly bidding with Åre to become Stockholm–Åre 2026. On 16 March 2019 a survey found that 55 percent of Swedes backed the Olympic bid – a huge positive shift. On 9 April the Swedish government supported the candidature and made over 200 necessary guarantees and warranties to the IOC.\nOn 24 June 2019, the International Olympic Committee, at the 134th IOC Session, awarded the 2026 Winter Olympics to Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, by a vote of 47 to 34.\nPrevious bids.\nStockholm hosted the 1912 Summer Olympics but has never hosted the Winter Games. Åre has never hosted the Olympics.\nBranding.\nThe candidate city logo was unveiled on 27 November 2018 during its presentation at the ANOC General Assembly in Tokyo, Japan. The logo of its candidature is derived from the Swedish folk design style and colors called the “Kurbits” style. The logo was designed by Anna Ahnborg and Happy F&amp;B. The bid book was published and the website was relaunched on 29 January 2019 in keeping with the bid slogan \"Made in Sweden\" ().\nReferences.\n "

Ilanaaq is the Inuktitut word for \"friend\". The logo was based on the Inukshuk (stone landmark or cairn) built by Alvin Kanak for the Northwest Territories Pavilion at Expo 86 and donated to the City of Vancouver after the event. It is now used as a landmark on English Bay Beach.\nSlogan.\nThe slogan for the 2010 Olympics was \"With glowing hearts\" (). The slogan is a reference to Canada's national anthem, O Canada.\nLook of the Games.\nLeo Obstbaum (1969–2009), the late director of design for the 2010 Winter Olympics, oversaw and designed many of the main symbols of the Games, including the mascots, medals and the design of the Olympic torches.\nMascots.\nThe mascots for the 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games were designed by Vicki Wong and Michael C. Murphy of Meomi Design and introduced on November 27, 2007. Inspired by traditional First Nations creatures, the mascots include:\nCoins.\nThe Royal Canadian Mint produced a series of commemorative coins celebrating the 2010 Games, and in partnership with CTV allowed users to vote on the \"Top 10 Canadian Olympic Winter Moments\"; where designs honouring the top three were added to the series of coins.\nMultimedia.\nDVD set.\nAn international release of a DVD set of the Olympics was released on 15 June 2010 in English and French.\nAlbums.\nThree albums, \"Canada's Hockey Anthems: Sounds of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games\", \"Sounds of Vancouver 2010: Opening Ceremony Commemorative Album\", and \"Sounds of Vancouver 2010: Closing Ceremony Commemorative Album\", composed, arranged and produced by Dave Pierce, were released to accompany the Games.

While more elaborate designs with influence from Khokhloma were considered, organizers chose to use a more minimalistic and \"futuristic\" design instead, consisting only of typefaces with no drawn elements at all. The emblem was designed so that the \"Sochi\" and \"2014\" lettering would mirror each other vertically, \"reflecting\" the contrasts of Russia's landscape (such as Sochi itself, a meeting point between the Black Sea and the Western Caucasus). Critics, including Russian bloggers, panned the logo for being too simplistic and lacking any real symbolism; Guo Chunning, designer of the 2008 Summer Olympics emblem \"Dancing Beijing\", criticized it for its lack of detail, and believed it should have contained more elements that represented winter and Russia's national identity, aside from its blue color scheme and its use of .ru, the top-level domain of Russia.\nSlogan.\nThe Games' official slogan, \"Hot. Cool. Yours.\" (\"Жаркие. Зимние. Твои.\"), was unveiled on 25 September 2012, 500 days before the opening ceremony. Presenting the slogan, SOC president Dmitry Chernyshenko explained that it represented the \"passion\" and heated competition of the Games' athletes, the contrasting climate of Sochi, and a sense of inclusion and belonging.\nMascots.\nFor the first time in Olympic history, a public vote was held to decide the mascots for the 2014 Winter Olympics; the 10 finalists, along with the results, were unveiled during live specials on Channel One. On 26 February 2011, the official mascots were unveiled, consisting of a polar bear, a snow hare, and a snow leopard. The initial rounds consisted of online voting among submissions, while the final round involved text messaging.\nColours.\nMost Olympic brands choose to represent themselves with 3 or 4 \"primary\" colours which are often symbolic to the region, as well as \"secondary\" colours not found in the logo which are often found in less common symbols and/or graphics. Sochi, however, made a statement to symbolise the diversity of Russia, and used over 30 colours from all over the spectrum, in 90 different patterns, all put together in a graphic designed to resemble a quilt. 5 different colour families were used at different venues around the games; Red Orange and Yellow, Yellow and Green, Green and Blue, Blue and Purple, and Purple and Pink. Non-venue areas, as well as volunteer jackets and other public spaces featured all 5 colour families together in one.\nBanknotes and coins.\nIn commemoration of the Games, Russian Post released a series of postage stamps depicting athletes, venues, and the mascots of the Games.\nVideo games.\nThe official Olympic video game is the fourth game in the \"Mario &amp; Sonic\" series, \"Mario &amp; Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games\". It was released by Nintendo for the Wii U on 8 November 2013 in Europe, and 15 November 2013 in North America. Others were ' for Android operating system and ' for online social network Facebook.\nStamps.\nThe Bank of Russia issued special coins and 100-ruble notes for the Games."

It is a stylised representation of the hangul letters \"p\" and \"ch\", these being the initial sounds of \"Pyeongchang\". The left-hand symbol is said to represent the Korean philosophical triad of heaven, earth and humanity ( \"cheon-ji-in\"), and the right-hand symbol represents a crystal of ice. In the emblem and all official materials, Pyeongchang was stylised in CamelCase as \"PyeongChang\", in order to alleviate potential confusion with Pyongyang, the similarly-named capital of neighbouring North Korea.\nLook of the Games.\n 5 primary colours were used, with venues using one of these colour families for branding. Different venues had different colours depending on the sport.\nMascots.\nThe official mascots of the 2018 Winter Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled on 2 June 2016. The Olympic mascot, Soohorang (Korean: 수호랑), is a white tiger. The mascot's name is a portmanteau of \"Sooho\", a Korean word for \"protection\", and \"Rang\" which is derived both from the Korean word for \"tiger\" and from the name of a traditional Korean folk song originating from Gangwon Province. Tigers have a strong association with Korean culture and folklore.\nVideo games.\nIn June 2017, Ubisoft announced that it would release an expansion pack for its winter sports video game \"Steep\" entitled \"Road to the Olympics\", which features new game modes and content inspired by the 2018 Winter Olympics.\nIn November 2017, the IOC announced it would support and sponsor an Intel Extreme Masters \"StarCraft II\" tournament in Pyeongchang preceding the Games. Its support of the tournament as a \"de facto\" demonstration event came on the heels of a report by the IOC which recognised that eSports \"could be considered as a sporting activity\". The tournament was won by Sasha \"Scarlett\" Hostyn of Canada; she became the second North American pro to place first at a major \"StarCraft II\" tournament in South Korea, and the first woman to win a major tournament.\nCorporate sponsorship and advertising.\nThe 2018 Winter Olympics saw increasing granularity in official sponsorships for technology vendors; Intel signed with the IOC to become part of its Worldwide Olympic Partner program, to promote 5G wireless technology, as well as broadcasting technology such as 360-degree video and virtual reality. Alibaba Group was also named the official e-commerce and cloud services provider. These categories affected how the vendors were allowed to promote themselves within the context of the Olympics: Samsung could showcase VR experiences but only within the context of its own smartphones due to Intel's sponsorship rights in relation to VR; Alibaba could not promote Alipay due to Visa Inc. sponsorship rights; and Intel could not promote end-user applications of 5G due to national sponsorship rights held by KT Corporation.\nIn 2015, Japanese automaker Toyota became the first-ever Worldwide Olympic Partner in the \"Mobility\" category, beginning 2017. However, Toyota elected to waive its domestic sponsorship rights for these Games to Hyundai Motor Company and Kia Motors, citing their near-dominance of the South Korean automobile industry, as well as their support of the Pyeongchang bid. As a result, Toyota did not perform any Olympic-related marketing in South Korea, the fleet of official IOC vehicles were provided by Hyundai and Kia, while Hyundai used the Games to showcase its Nexo hydrogen fuel cell SUV and self-driving vehicle technology."

Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Zambia women and another international side after 1 July 2018 are eligible to have full WT20I status.\nZambia's was part of the Botswana 7s tournament in August 2018 against Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia and Sierra Leone. However, Zambia's matches were not classified as WT20Is as they had a Botswana player in their squad.\nZambia had their membership suspended by the International Cricket Council in 2019 due to continued non-compliance to amend multiple breaches of the ICC's Membership Criteria, relating to general competence and an acceptable detailed governance system. With Zambia failing to address the ICC's concerns, their membership was terminated in 2021."

This includes the results from the Biathlon World Championships 2019 (held between the World Cup stages in Salt Lake City and Oslo).\nStandings.\nIn each event places 1 to 40 (1 to 30 in a Mass start) are awarded points, a victory being worth 60 points. The full point system is shown in the table on the right. In a Mass start event only 30 athletes are allowed to participate and the points awarded for ranks 22 to 30 differ from the system used in other events. Equal placings (ties) give an equal number of points. An athlete's total World Cup Score is the sum of all World Cup points earned in the season, minus the points from 2 events in which the athlete got their worst scores. Ties in this score are broken by comparing the tied athletes' number of victories. If this number is the same for the athletes in question, the number of second places is compared, and so on. If a tie cannot be broken by this procedure, it remains a tie."

        "text": "The 2021 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships (\"2021 WJHC\") were the 45th edition of the Ice Hockey World Junior Championship. It began on December 25, 2020, and ended with the gold medal game on January 5, 2021. This marked the 16th time that Canada hosted the WJIHC. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, it was hosted in a \"bubble\" behind closed doors in Edmonton, Alberta, with no spectators admitted for any game.\nBackground.\nOn December 6, 2018, it was announced that Edmonton and Red Deer, in the province of Alberta, would be the host cities. It was the third time Edmonton has hosted the tournament, after previously hosting in 1995 and 2012, and the first to use Rogers Place as a venue.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the IIHF cancelled all lower-division U20 championships on September 17, 2020 (thus there was no promotion or relegation), and announced that the top division tournament would be hosted solely by Edmonton using a \"bubble\" strategy similar to what was used for the NHL's 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs in Edmonton and Toronto. This decision resulted in the elimination of Red Deer as the secondary host city of the 2021 tournament. All games were held behind closed doors with no outside spectators. It was subsequently announced that Edmonton and Red Deer would host the 2022 tournament, and that Gothenburg, Sweden would be shifted from 2022 to 2024.\nOn October 19, 2020, the full schedule for the tournament was announced, with play beginning on Christmas for the first time since the 2004–05 edition.\nOn November 25, 2020, Hockey Canada suspended its selection camp and quarantined all players for 14 days (retroactive to November 23) due to two positive COVID-19 tests among participants. Swedish head coach Tomas Montén, along with two assistant leaders and players William Eklund, Karl Henriksson, William Wallinder, and Albin Grewe from the Swedish preliminary roster, were forced to leave the team after testing positive for COVID-19 too close to the beginning of the championship.\nTeam Canada captain Kirby Dach sustained an injury in Canada's pre-tournament game against Russia, and was ruled out for the rest of the tournament.\nNine German players were quarantined under COVID-19 protocols through the first two games due to positive tests prior to the tournament. No new COVID-19 positives were detected within the bubble through the conclusion of the tournament.\nBlackhawks prospect and 2020 first rounder and Team Germany forward Lukas Reichel was unable to make the tournament after he tested positive with COVID-19.\nTop Division.\nMatch officials.\nThe following officials were assigned by the IIHF to officiate the 2021 World Junior Championships. All officials are Canadian due to restrictions from COVID-19 pandemic on travel and ease of getting officials on site.\nReferees\nLinesmen\nSeeding.\nThe seedings in the preliminary round are based on the 2020 tournament's final standings using the serpentine system. The IIHF announced the groups on January 5, 2020, with Austria being promoted from Division I A after winning the 2020 Division I A Tournament.\nPreliminary round.\n\"All times are local (Mountain Standard Time – UTC-7).\"\nPlayoff round.\nWinning teams will be reseeded for the semi-finals in accordance with the following ranking:\nDivision I.\nDivision I, II, and III tournaments were cancelled.\nGroup A.\nThe tournament would have been held in Hørsholm, Denmark, from December 13 to 19, 2020.\nGroup B.\nThe tournament would have been held in Tallinn, Estonia, from February 10 to 17, 2021.\nDivision II.\nDivision I, II, and III tournaments were cancelled.\nGroup A.\nThe tournament would have been held in Brașov, Romania, from February 8 to 14, 2021.\nGroup B.\nThe tournament would have been held in Belgrade, Serbia, from February 8 to 14, 2021.\nDivision III.\nThe tournament would have been held in Mexico City, Mexico, from January 10 to 17, 2021, but was cancelled."

        "title": "Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019–20",
        "text": "The Bangladesh cricket team toured India in November 2019 to play two Test and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. The Test series formed part of the inaugural 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship. It was the second time that Bangladesh toured India to play a Test series, and the first time that Bangladesh played a T20I series against India in India. The Test series also featured the first day/night match to be played by either side.\nBangladesh's captain, Shakib Al Hasan, was initially selected to lead the team on the tour. However, on 29 October 2019, the International Cricket Council (ICC) banned Shakib from all cricket for two years, with one year suspended, after breaching the ICC's Anti-Corruption Code. Following Shakib's ban, Mominul Haque was named as the team's Test captain and Mahmudullah was named as the captain of the T20I side.\nThe first match of the tour, the T20I in Delhi, was the 1,000th men's Twenty20 International match to be played. Bangladesh won the match by seven wickets, to record their first ever victory against India in the format. However, India won the next two matches to win the series 2–1. In the third and final match, India's Deepak Chahar took six wickets for seven runs to record the best bowling figures in a T20I match.\nIndia won the Test series 2–0, with both matches finishing inside three days. It was India's twelfth-consecutive Test series win at home, the most by any team at home. It was also India's seventh-consecutive win in Tests, a record for the team, and the seventh-consecutive win under Virat Kohli's captaincy, also a record for India. India's winning margin in the second Test of an innings made them the first team to record four consecutive wins in Test cricket by an innings.\nBackground.\nIn October 2019, several Bangladesh cricketers voiced their concerns to the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) regarding the administration of their domestic cricket, with the possibility of a players' strike. The cricketers had agreed not to take part in any further cricket activity until the issues with the BCB were resolved. In response, the BCB called an emergency meeting with its directors to resolve the situation. Sourav Ganguly, president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) was confident that the tour would go ahead as planned, saying \"it's an internal matter, they will sort it out. No, no, they'll come\". Two days after announcing the strike, it was called off, following Shakib Al Hasan's meeting with the BCB. The following day, India named their squads for the tour, with Virat Kohli rested for the T20I matches, with Rohit Sharma named as captain in his place.\nOn 29 October 2019, Shakib Al Hasan was given a two-year ban from cricket by the ICC, with one year suspended, for \"failing to report corrupt approaches\". The approaches were made during the 2017–18 Bangladesh Tri-Nation Series in January 2018, and the 2018 Indian Premier League. Along with the BCB, Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, offered her support to Shakib. The BCB said they were \"shocked and extremely disappointed\", but hoped that he would come back to cricket once the ban ends. As a result, Mominul Haque and Mahmudullah were named as Bangladesh's Test and T20I captains respectively.\nTwo days before the start of the T20I series, the air quality in Delhi had dropped to hazardous levels, with a public health emergency declared. However, despite the poor air quality, both teams were able to train at the ground. Smog had previously affected the third Test between India and Sri Lanka in December 2017, with several players on both sides falling ill. Sourav Ganguly admitted that the BCCI needs to be a \"bit more practical\" when scheduling cricket matches in northern India at the end of the year. On the morning of the first T20I match, thirty-two flights were diverted and schools were closed in Delhi, due to the air pollution. India's Ravichandran Ashwin described the conditions in the city as \"scary\".\nAhead of the start of the tour, the BCCI submitted a request to the BCB for the second Test of the series, at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, to be played as a day/night match. One day after the request was made, the BCB agreed to the day/night Test. It was the first day/night Test played by either team and the first day/night Test to be played in India. The BCCI agreed that the Test match would use the SG pink ball, instead of the Kookaburra ball. India's captain, Virat Kohli, said that the day/night match is \"going to be a landmark event for Indian cricket and Indian Test cricket\". The Cricket Association of Bengal also made many arrangements to mark the event with the whole city of Kolkata was decorated with pink lights. Ahead of the start of the match, paratroopers were supposed to hand over the balls to both captains, but the plan was cancelled due to a security reason. The Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, and Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, rang the ceremonial bell to inaugurate the match.\nSquads.\nAhead of the tour, Mohammad Saifuddin was ruled out of Bangladesh's T20I squad with a back injury. Bangladesh's Tamim Iqbal opted not to play, due to the birth of his second child, with Imrul Kayes named as his replacement for T20Is. One day before the start of the second Test, Saif Hassan was ruled out of Bangladesh's squad due to a split webbing. Following the close of play on the first day of the second Test, Rishabh Pant was released from India's squad, allowing him to play in the 2019–20 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. K. S. Bharat was also added to India's Test squad, as cover for Wriddhiman Saha."

        "text": "The opening ceremony of the 2019 Pan American Games took place on Friday July 26, 2019, at the Estadio Nacional del Perú in Lima, Peru, and ran from 20:00 to 23:05 PET. The ceremony was entitled \"Amazing Peru!\" and featured a stage designed as Pariacaca, the sacred mountain of Lima. It was produced by Italian company Balich Worldwide Shows and directed by creative director Francisco Negrin.\nProceedings.\nCountdown.\nThe ceremony began with countdown numbers from 30 to zero. In the final 17 numbers, colors of the logos of the previous Pan American Games were projected onto the mountain stage. Volunteers then ran to the center of the stage, forming various sports pictograms and eventually the Games emblem.\nThe Nation.\nAfterwards, the President of Panam Sports Neven Ilic and the President of the Republic of Peru Martin Vizcarra were introduced to the crowd.\nThis was followed by a performance of \"El Perú\", a poem composed by Marco Martos, conveyed through all 49 languages of Peru. Performers on stage would then join in performing the National Anthem of Peru.\nThe Calling.\nInspired by the \"Warachikuy\", this segment began with a performer, depicting the god \"Pariacaca\", summoning \"chasquis\". They then called for 41 marathon runners, representing the 41 nations participating in the Games. These runners were challenged by 41 deities in order to prove their athletic worth.\nDawn.\nPacific.\nThe first half of Dawn is set in the Peruvian coast. With the marathon runners haven proved their worth, Pariacaca then called for the stars, with constellations projected onto the mountain. The Pacific Ocean was depicted with fish inspired by pre-Hispanic art. The fish were joined by fishermen on \"caballitos de totora\", reed fishing boats, which are considered ancient predecessors to the modern-day surfboard.\nThe fishermen were then joined by modern surfers, as props resembling thorny oysters were revealed on the bottom of the mountain. The fishermen and surfers exited the stage together as the stage was illuminated by yellow and orange lighting, indicating the arrival of dawn.\nAmancaes.\nWith the arrival of dawn, the thorny oysters transformed into amancaes flowers, the symbol of Lima. Performers dressed as amancaes flowers walked onto the stage, accompanied by harp and cajon players who perform from the mountain. The amancaes dancers were further joined by dancers on horseback and on foot, and ended the segment by coming together to form a map of Peru on the floor.\nSports.\nThe stadium floor was then covered by \"cajones\", an Afro-Peruvian percussion, playing music as the sports pictograms were depicted on the mountain stage. They were joined by Charlie Parra who performed on guitar as the sports were brought to life by an acrobatic performance. Afterwards, the official song of the Games, \"Jugamos Todos\" was performed by Guillermo Bussinger, Pelo D’Ambrosio, Sandra Muente and Shantall. The segment came to an end when the \"cajones\" joined to form the mascot of the Games, Milco, on the stadium floor.\nParade of Athletes.\nDuring the Parade of Nations, each participating country's team marched into the stadium, preceded by a person dressed as an \"Ekeko\" – the Tiwanakan god of abundance and prosperity. The Caral stage reproduced the colors of the corresponding national flag, while the natural scenery of each participating nation was projected onto the mountain. As per Pan American Games tradition, the national team of Argentina, the host of the first edition of the Games, entered first, while Peru as the host nation entered last. The rest of the delegations entered based on the Spanish alphabetical order.\nAbundance.\nPago a la Tierra.\nOnce all of the athletes were seated, the artistic performances continued with a two-part segment. The first part began with a \"pago a la tierra\", an Andean ritual in which offerings is given to \"Pachamama\", or Mother Earth. A group of young travelers witnessed the ritual, who then go on a journey to the top of the mountain. As they climbed the stage, art depicting Peru's natural ecosystems and inspired from Peruvian painters were projected onto the mountain surface.\nOnce the travelers reached the top, a representation of the Peruvian Amazon was revealed on the floor, with performers depicting the flora and fauna of the rainforest. A shaman was shown witnessing this, and the river became the \"Yacumama\", projected on the mountain surface.\nSuperfoods.\nThe segment continued with a celebration of the diversity of Peruvian gastronomy. Various indigenous persons carried a food ingredient to a table placed in the center on the stadium, which was then projected on the mountain. They were then joined by immigrants, each contributing their own food ingredients to the table. The segment culminated with the arrival of Chef Micha Tsamura, who oversaw the table of food from the mountain.\nWeaving.\nLooms.\nContinuing the theme of natural products, this segment focused on wool and cotton. A tree appeared on the caral stage, with mothers and daughters weaving around it. This practice was then expanded to cover the mountain, with performers weaving a larger textile of wool and cotton, measuring 32 meters, over it.\nThe Cutting Edge.\nThe segment continued by expanding on the textile theme, with a fashion show taking place on the stadium floor. Performers wearing both folk costumes and contemporary designs crossed the stage as Pauchi Sasaki performed a specialized version of \"El Condor Pasa\".\nThe segment ended with a tribute to the \"tapadas limeñas\", who were women who would cover their heads and faces with a cloak and wide skirt, to ensure complete anonymity.\nStreets.\nThe segment began with a continuation of the \"tapadas limeñas\", who transformed into their historical counterparts. Watercolor paintings representing the viceroyalty era of Peru were projected onto the mountain, with performers reenacting scenes of daily life in the era.\nMoving to a performance based in the 1950s, Juan Diego Flórez entered the stadium to perform a virtual duet with the late singer Chabuca Granda, whose face was projected onto the mountain. They performed \"“Bello Durmiente”\", followed by a solo from Flórez in which he performed \"“La Flor de la Canela\"\".\nAfterwards, modern day citizens of Lima entered the stadium, reenacting a street scene representing contemporary Lima. A flash mob on the street was created, displaying urban dance to the rhythm of cumbia. The segment ended with the formation of the logo of Marca Peru, which is used to promote tourism to Peru.\nThe Games.\nThe Panam Sports flag was carried by former Peruvian sportsmen including Gladys Euesbio, Roberto Abugattas, Raul Pacheco, Natalia Cuglievan, Luis Minamy, Carlos Zegarra and Monica Liyau, and raised to the Panam Sports anthem by the armed forces.\nThis was followed by speeches from the President of the Lima 2019 Organizing Committee, Carlos Neuhaus, and the President of Panam Sports, Neven Ilic. At the conclusion of his speech, Ilic invited the President of Peru to inaugurate the Games.\n\"Dear friends of the 41 countries of the Americas and the world, Welcome to the biggest sports party on the continent. Peru, land of great cultures and an ancient history, welcomes you with open arms. It is an honour for me to inaugurate the 18th Pan American Games Lima 2019\".\n- Martin Vizcarra, President of the Republic of Peru, declaring the Games open in Spanish.\nWith the Games officially opened, the oaths on behalf of athletes and judges were taken.\nInti.\nThe Relay.\nAfter a video showing the torch's journey across Peru, a performance dedicated to the pre-Hispanic nations of Peru took place. Performers recreated geometric shapes on the stadium floor, while pre-Hispanic leaders climbed the mountain. This portion of the segment ended as the mountain opened to reveal the Intihuatana atop, connected to the caral stage by a beam of light.\nThe Flame.\nWith the cauldron revealed, the torch relay's final leg continued in the stadium. The torch was carried into the stadium by Edith Moeding, Olympic medalist in athletics. He passed on the torch to two young athletes: judoka Ariana Balterzar Minan and tennis player Carlos Fernandez. They handed the torch to volleyball player Lucha Fuentes. Lucha handed the torch to last torch bearer, 1988 Summer Olympics women's volleyball silver medalist Cecilia Tait, who lit the cauldron.\nThe Concert.\nThe ceremony concluded with Puerto Rican international star Luis Fonsi performing seven songs which are \"Imposible\", \"Calypso\", \"Échame La Culpa\", \"Date La Vuelta\", \"No Me Doy Por Vencido\", \"Party Animal\" and global hit song at the time – Despacito."

Departure and arrivals of all players that were included in a Super Rugby squad for 2016 or 2017 are listed here, regardless of when it occurred. Future-dated transfers are only included if confirmed by the player or his agent, his former team or his new team.\nTeams usually name their squads for 2017 – typically containing around 35–40 players – in late 2016 or early 2017. In addition to the main squad, teams can also name additional players that train in backup or development squads for the franchises. These players are denoted by \"(wider training group)\" for New Zealand teams, or \"(extended playing squad)\" for Australian teams."

It is one of the town's most well-known landmarks as it is quite dominant on the skyline.\nHistory.\nThe church came about because Captain Washington Hibbert of Bilton Grange, married Julia Tichborne, a Catholic woman in 1839. As there was no provision for Catholics in Rugby, Hibbert bought a plot of land off Dunchurch Road and commissioned Augustus Pugin to design a church. It was first opened in 1847, designed in the Gothic revival style. It was enlarged in 1864 by Pugin's son Edward Welby Pugin, and in 1872 the current tall and slender spire was added, designed by Bernard Whelan, which is nearly 200 feet (61 metres) tall. The church has been Grade II* listed since 1949.\nToday.\nThe church is part of the Rugby Deanery in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Birmingham."

        "text": "Emil Richard Fischer (August 15, 1887 – January 2, 1958) was an American businessman and a football executive for the Green Bay Packers. Fischer was well known in the Green Bay cheese industry, a nationally recognized businessman, and a local civic leader. From 1948 to 1952, he served as the fifth president of the Packers. He is credited with leading the Packers through one of the most difficult periods in the team's history. During his tenure, the team's co-founder and longtime coach Curly Lambeau resigned, the Packers issued their third stock sale, and the National Football League (NFL) merged with the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). He also sat on the organization's board of directors and executive committee from 1935 to 1958. After his presidency ended, he served as chairman of the board until his death in 1958. In recognition of his contributions to the team, Fischer was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 2013.\nEarly life.\nEmil Fischer was born on August 15, 1887, in Plymouth, Wisconsin, and moved to Green Bay, Wisconsin, in 1908.\nCheese industry.\nFischer was one of Green Bay's most respected, successful, and prominent businessmen in the early 20th century. He started in the cheese industry in 1908; for the next 18 years he worked for various companies, including C.A. Straubel Co., Stevens Company, and Pauly and Pauly Co., before founding his own business, the Atlas Cold Storage Co. Atlas would go on to become one of the largest cheese distributors in the country in the 1930s. He also helped establish the cheese industry in Green Bay by traveling the country advocating for large cheese companies to move to the city.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nFischer established himself as a successful businessman in Green Bay in the 1920s. He was an early supporter of the Packers and believed the franchise was good for the local community. He was elected to the Packers board of directors in 1926 and to the executive committee in 1935. In 1948, he was elected as the fifth president of the Green Bay Packers, after the resignation of Lee Joannes.\nFischer's first years as president were marked by the resolution of multiple contentious issues. First, many people within the NFL doubted the future of the Packers, since the team was located in such a small market and was not financially lucrative. There were rumors that the Packers would not be included in the league after its merger with the AAFC. However, not only were the Packers included in the league post-merger, Fischer was named the president of the new National Conference. Second, Fischer and the board of directors had to fight to keep the Packers from being sold to a private owner, something that the team's co-founder, head coach, and general manager Curly Lambeau was trying to orchestrate. These disagreements led to the resignation of multiple team officials, including George Whitney Calhoun and W. Webber Kelly. After Rockwood Lodge, the Packers' training facility that was purchased by Lambeau for a large sum just a few years prior, burned down in 1950, Lambeau resigned and took a position with the Chicago Cardinals. That same year, Fischer organized a new stock sale to help raise funding to keep the team financially stable. The funds from this stock sale and the insurance money from the Rockwood Lodge fire established the basis for future success and financially stability. Fischer believed so much in the team that he purchased 200 stocks himself, the maximum allowed under the Packers' articles of incorporation.\nFischer resigned in 1952 and was succeeded by Russ Bogda. After his presidency, Fischer served as chairman of the board from 1953 until his death in 1958. Although the Packers lacked on-field success during his presidency, Fischer is recognized for helping lead the franchise through multiple challenging periods, including the contentious resignation of team co-founder Curly Lambeau and the merger of the NFL and AAFC. His organization of the 1950 stock sale also provided the funding needed to help keep the Packers financially stable. In recognition of his contributions as a team executive, Fischer was posthumously inducted in the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 2013.\nPersonal life.\nFischer was married to Myra Fischer (). The Fischers, who maintained a winter home in Miami, Florida, for over 20 years, were well known for taking part in \"high society\" by frequenting exclusive events, associating with celebrities, and hosting business leaders at their house. Fischer enjoyed horse racing, fine arts, and shooting. He also was part of the Masonic Order, a member of the Elks Lodge, and a member of various country clubs. Fischer died on January 2, 1958, at the age of 70."

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 November 2002.\nHistory.\nNeon gas was first discovered by William Ramsay and Morris Travers in 1898 in London. Neon signs such as the Sharpies Golf House sign are the result of French engineer and chemist, Georges Claude. In 1902 Georges and his French company Claude applied an electric discharge to a sealed tube of neon gas to create a neon lamp. By 1923, Claude Neon had introduced neon gas signs to the United States; however, neon reached its height of popularity in the 1940s and 1950s with many colourful designs that advertised a huge range of products.\nThe Golf House grew out of a pawn shop run by Russian immigrant, Harry Landis who arrived in Sydney via Broken Hill in 1917. In 1918, Landis purchased the Railway Loan Office at 226 Elizabeth Street, Surry Hills where he opened a pawnshop. In 1923 he moved the pawnshop into 220–222 Elizabeth Street, where two of Harry's sons entered the business, Harry Jr. and Jack. The pawn shop became divided into two main sections, musical instruments, run by Harry Jr. and sporting goods, particularly golf equipment run by Jack. After WWII military service, Jack Landis established the Golf House. Harry Landis Sr. died in 1953 and the shop was divided between the two sons.\nThe Golf House sign was built between 1958 &amp; 1964 by Consolidated Neon, which became Claude Neon, who owned and maintained the sign which they leased to the Golf House. Ron Ries, an employee at Consolidated Neon for over 50 years remembers how the Golf House sign was designed and drawn out on a blackboard in fluorescent paint. It was then sized and priced and taken out for the signing of a contract. Ron Ries then took out the drawings for approval at the Council Health and Building Department and when the approval was granted, he supervised the construction of the sign. It was first laid out in full size on a brown paper pattern in the layout room. The pattern was then used to make the steel skeleton, which had a front return and a back to enclose and waterproof the electrics. The neon tubes and globes were attached to the skeleton. The sign won the Outdoor Advertising Association award for the best sign in 1964.\nIn 1977 Harry Landis Jnr moved his music business to Park Street, leaving The Golf House as the sole occupant. In 1978 he sold The Golf House to his son Rob, who worked in the business and had two investor partners. While the shop was the premier golf store in Sydney, it relied to a great extent on the second hand trade and new equipment was increasingly being made more cheaply in Taiwan and elsewhere. It became uneconomical to buy and refurbish old golf clubs. In 1985 Rob Landis and his partners sold the stock and the half-share in the building to professional golfer, Lindsay Sharp, while retaining the name. Lindsay was unwilling to pay the price asked for the goodwill and renamed the business Sharpies Golf House. The sign had to be changed to Sharpies Golf House by Claude Neon because Lindsay did not own the original name. Lindsay Sharp is known for his sporting efforts as he was the first professional to win the newly introduced National Ambrose competition in Australia.\nIn 1996 Lindsay Sharp sold the half-share in the premises and in 1999 he sold the business to Ray Drummond, who has a number of golf stores (Nevada Bob's Golf Shops). In 2002, Claude Neon, the owners of the sign, proposed to take it down on the basis that it had become unsafe. The announcement was controversial, and led to an agreement whereby ownership of the sign was transferred to Sharpies Golf House on the condition that it be donated to the City of Sydney at the conclusion of the lease. It was listed on the State Heritage Register in 2002, at which time it was noted that it was in a \"perilous condition\".\nSharpies Golf House closed in 2004, and the new owners of the building sought to donate it to the Powerhouse Museum, but met with opposition from the NSW Heritage Office. The City of Sydney ordered its removal in 2007 on safety grounds. It was stored in the building for several years, and was eventually transferred to the museum in 2014 after agreements were reached between the council, heritage office and the museum. The former building on which the sign had sat was demolished 2016–17.\nDescription.\nThe Sharpies Golf House sign is a skeleton sign made of steel angle with a return and a back to enclose the electrics. The sign is composed of a figure hitting a golf ball in an arc over the words \"SHARPIES GOLF HOUSE\". The sign has approximately 80 neon tubes bent and attached. The letters of the sign are approximately 14m long by 1.5m high. The elements consist of the golfer, the club in three positions, the ball, with a metal track and a chaser of about 48 globes, the hole and the flag. The flag on the sign shows the number 19, referring to the golfing reference of the \"19th hole\" as the clubhouse after a round.\nIn 1985, Claude Neon Pty Ltd changed the name on the sign from \"The Golf House\" to \"Sharpies Golf House\".\nCondition.\nAt the time of its heritage listing in 2002, the sign continued to function, but the structure of the sign was in very poor condition. Parts of the curved upper section and the bases of the letters had already corroded to the point that pieces have broken away. The curved lightweight metal top member with external light bulbs was severely rusted along its base. Some places had already fallen from the structure. The pan letters of the sign were severely corroded along their bases. Some pieces of this section of the sign had fallen from the structure. Although the fixing bolts of the letters are in reasonable condition, there is an immediate risk that other places may fall. Some nuts and bolts on the rear support trusses are corroded to the point where they no longer exist. There is corrosion in the gussett plates and in other areas, though not severe. The rear beam is severely corroded at top and bottom flange slice plates.\nAlthough there is some corrosion of metal elements, the sign can still demonstrate its significance. It was agreed at the time of its donation to the Powerhouse Museum that any inclusion of the sign in a new development on the original site would require a copy sign, and that the original would remain in the museum.\nHeritage listing.\nSharpies Golf Sign has high rarity values as a unique example of 20th century advertising. The sign is historically significant as (at the time of heritage listing) the only original animated neon sign remaining in situ and is representative of the animated neon sign phase during the 1950s.

        "title": "Professional snooker career of Ronnie O'Sullivan",
        "text": " \nRonnie O'Sullivan started his professional snooker career in 1992 and is widely considered one of the greatest players in the history of the sport. His play and accomplishments are described by some peers and pundits as being the greatest in the modern era of snooker. O'Sullivan is a seven-time world champion, and holds many records, including the fastest maximum break in professional competition; the highest number of century breaks; the highest number of maximum breaks, and the most Triple Crown event titles (23).\nCareer.\nAmateur career: early achievements.\nO'Sullivan started playing snooker from just seven years old, and showed a considerable natural talent for the game: winning his first club tournament aged 9 and scoring his first century break (a run of 117) aged 10. O'Sullivan's first major success was becoming the 1989 British Under-16 Champion, aged 13, beating Andy Hicks 3–1 in the final. A year later, O'Sullivan made a \"big breakthrough\" at a professional-amateur tournament in Stevenage. He defeated world number 34 Marcel Gauvreau 3–2 in the quarter-finals, with a break of 120 in the deciding frame before progressing to the final and defeating fellow amateur Anthony Hamilton for the title. Afterwards, Gauvreau described O'Sullivan's play as \"unbelievable\" and that \"No-one's ever played that well against me.\" Still aged 14, O'Sullivan made his television debut at the Thames Snooker Classic. He made a televised 75 break during his quarter-final match, which was commentated on by Steve Davis, before being defeated at the semi-final stage. Two years later, O'Sullivan reached the final of the 1991 English Amateur Championship, where he fell 10–13 to Steve Judd. During the tournament, at the age of 15 years and 98 days, he became the youngest player to compile a maximum break in a recognised tournament, a record that stood until July 2017 when it was broken by Sean Maddocks from Liverpool, who was 15 years and 90 days old when he achieved the feat. Later the same year, O'Sullivan defeated Patrick Delsemme 11–4 for the 1991 IBSF World Under-21 Snooker Championship title. O'Sullivan's last notable amateur achievement before turning professional was capturing the 1991 Junior Pot Black title, defeating Declan Murphy 2–0 in the final.\n1992/1993 season: qualifying success, first professional title, Crucible debut.\nO'Sullivan won a record 38 consecutive matches after turning professional all in ranking events and surpassing the previous record of Stephen Hendry in his debut season, and he won 74 of his 76 qualifying matches. All qualifying matches were played in a block from June to September 1992 in the Norbreck Castle in Blackpool. The final stages for all the events came later in the season. He also set a record for the fastest victory, winning a best-of-9-frame match in 43 minutes to beat Tony Drago's previous record. After this performance, MC Alan Hughes first gave him the nickname \"The Rocket\". O'Sullivan also won his first title as a professional: the non-ranking Extra Challenge in Bangkok, triumphing over John Parrott, James Wattana and Alan McManus in the round-robin format. O'Sullivan qualified for the World Championship and made his debut at the Crucible Theatre on 18 April 1993, at the age of 17 years and 134 days and he is still the fourth-youngest player ever to compete at the venue, behind Luca Brecel, Yan Bingtao and Stephen Hendry. He lost 7–10 to Alan McManus in the first round. O'Sullivan was named the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association's (WPBSA) Young Player of the Year for 1993.\n1993/1994 season: historic UK Championship and British Open titles, Masters debut.\nIn the 1993–94 season, O'Sullivan enjoyed more success by first qualifying for the Masters as a wild card by winning the 1993 Benson and Hedges Snooker Championship by defeating John Lardner 9–6 in the final. Then O'Sullivan captured his first professional ranking title and first part of the Triple Crown, the UK Championship by defeating Stephen Hendry 10–6 in the final. At the age of 17 years and 358 days he became the youngest ever winner of a ranking tournament. One month later, in the European Open final, he came across Stephen Hendry again but this time, he was defeated by 5–9. Making his debut at the Masters, he lost in the first round 1–5 to Dennis Taylor, who was the Masters champion in 1987, by defeating Alex Higgins 9–8 in the final. He won his second ranking title of the season at the British Open by defeating James Wattana 9–4 in the final. He reached the second round of the World Championship, but lost 3–13 against John Parrott. Having started the season ranked number 57 in the world, he ended it ranked number 9, and was named the WPBSA's Player of the Year for 1994.\n1994/1995 season: Masters title, two ranking event finals.\nO'Sullivan did not win any ranking titles during the 1994–95 season, but reached two finals. He lost to James Wattana in the final of the Thailand Open and to John Higgins in the final of the British Open. At the Masters, O'Sullivan captured his first title by defeating Higgins 9–3 in the final. With this victory, he became the youngest player ever to win the tournament at the age of 19 years and 69 days. and came a step closer to collecting all the Triple Crown events, only requiring a world title to complete his collection. At the World Championship, he recorded his furthest run yet by reaching the quarter-finals, where he lost 8–13 to Stephen Hendry.\n1995/1996 season: Masters runner-up, controversy at the Crucible.\nIn the 1995–96 season, O'Sullivan again did not capture any ranking titles but was victorious at the non-ranking Charity Challenge defeating John Higgins 9–6 in the final. As defending champion, O'Sullivan reached the final of the Masters, but lost his title 5–10 to Stephen Hendry. For the first time, O'Sullivan reached the World Championship semi-finals, but lost 14–16 to Peter Ebdon. After his 10–3 first round victory over Alain Robidoux, Robidoux accused O'Sullivan of showing \"disrespect\" after he had played left-handed during the match. Robidoux refused to shake hands with O'Sullivan at the end of the match. O'Sullivan responded by saying that he was \"better left-handed than [Robidoux] is right-handed.\" Later during the tournament, before his quarter-final match with John Higgins, O'Sullivan was involved in an incident with assistant press officer, Michael Ganley, in the press room. O'Sullivan admitted to assaulting Ganley during the incident. For this snooker's governing body, the WPBSA, gave O'Sullivan a two-year suspended ban and a £20,000 fine, and advised him to donate £10,000 to charity, but allowed him to continue competing at the event.\n1996/1997 season: Masters runner-up, Asian Classic and German Open titles, fastest ever maximum break.\nIn the 1996–97 season, O'Sullivan won two ranking titles: the Asian Classic by narrowly defeating Brian Morgan 9–8 in the final, and the German Open by defeating Alain Robidoux 9–7 in the final. O'Sullivan again reached the final of the Charity Challenge, where he faced Stephen Hendry in a first-to-nine frame match. O'Sullivan trailed 2–8 before winning six frames in a row to level at 8–8, before Hendry won the deciding frame with a maximum break. At the Masters, O'Sullivan reached his third consecutive final, where he faced Steve Davis. After O'Sullivan took the first two frames with back-to-back century breaks of 116 and 113, the third frame was disrupted by a streaker, Lianne Croft. Davis later stated that the streaking incident affected O'Sullivan's concentration, allowing him back into the match and the afternoon session ended all-square at 4–4. O'Sullivan began the evening session by winning four frames in 49 minutes to take an 8–4 lead, but Davis fought back to win the next six frames and clinch the title with a 10–8 victory. On 21 April 1997, while playing Mick Price in the first round of the World Championship, O'Sullivan made the fastest ever competitive maximum break in just over five minutes—averaging under nine seconds per shot. This was also O'Sullivan's first maximum break in professional competition. He exited the World Championship in the second round, losing 12–13 against Darren Morgan. O'Sullivan also won the non-ranking European League, defeating Hendry 10–8 in the final.\n1997/1998 season: UK Championship and Scottish Open titles.\nO'Sullivan captured two more ranking titles in the 1997–98 season. By beating three-time defending champion Stephen Hendry 10–6 in the final, O'Sullivan won his second UK Championship title. O'Sullivan also triumphed at the Scottish Open by defeating John Higgins 9–5 in the final. For the third year in a row, O'Sullivan made the final of the Charity Challenge. He was defeated, like the year previous, in a final frame decider, 8–9 to John Higgins. For the first time in three years O'Sullivan did not reach the final at the Masters, losing to Steve Davis. After defeating Ken Doherty 9–3 in the final of the Irish Masters, a post-match drug test found traces of cannabis in his system. O'Sullivan was stripped of the title, forfeited the prize money and the title was awarded to Doherty by the WPBSA. O'Sullivan reached the World Championship semi-finals for the second time in his career, but lost 9–17 to eventual champion John Higgins.\n1998/1999 season: no major or ranking success.\nO'Sullivan began the 1998–99 season by winning the non-ranking Scottish Masters, but went on to win no more titles during the season. At the UK Championship, O'Sullivan was defending champion, but withdrew from the tournament shortly before his scheduled first-round match. His manager stated that he was \"suffering from physical and nervous exhaustion\" and that his doctor had ordered \"a complete rest from snooker\". Later reports stated instead that he was suffering from depression at the time. In the quarter-finals of the Welsh Open, O'Sullivan made the second maximum of his professional career, playing against James Wattana. O'Sullivan reached the quarter-finals of the Masters, but lost 2–6 to Ken Doherty. In his fourth consecutive final in the Charity Challenge, and in a repeat outcome of last year's final: O'Sullivan lost to John Higgins again, this time 4–9. At the World Championship, O'Sullivan reached his third semi-final in four years. But, he was again denied a place in the final when he lost 13–17 to Stephen Hendry in a high quality match that featured century breaks in four consecutive frames (two by O'Sullivan of 134 and 110, scoring 134 because of missing the pink for the maximum break).\n1999/2000 season: China and Scottish Open titles.\nAt the beginning of the 1999–2000 season, O'Sullivan reached the final of the one-off non-ranking Millennium Cup. However, he lost 2–7 to Stephen Lee. Throughout the rest of the season, O'Sullivan won two ranking tournaments: the China Open, where he defeated Lee 9–2 in the final, and the Scottish Open, where he defeated Mark Williams 9–1 in the final. At the Grand Prix and Scottish Open, O'Sullivan hit his third and fourth competitive maximum breaks of his career. Competing for England, O'Sullivan was part of the winning Nations Cup team. Partnering John Parrott, Jimmy White and Stephen Lee: they defeated defending champions Wales 6–4 in the final. In the Triple Crown events, O'Sullivan did not experience any winning success: losing at the quarter-final stages of both the UK Championship and Masters, 3–9 to Matthew Stevens and 3–6 to John Parrott respectively, and losing in the first round of the World Championship, 9–10 to David Gray despite becoming the first player to compile five century breaks in a first round match at the Crucible.\n2000/2001 season: World Championship title and China Open defence.\nThe 2000–01 season was O'Sullivan's most successful to date: winning two ranking titles and four non-ranking titles. O'Sullivan started the season by reaching the final in three out of the first four tournaments: winning the Champions Cup by defeating Mark Williams 7–5 in the final after being 1–4 behind, coming runner-up to Williams 5–9 at the Grand Prix, and winning the Scottish Masters by defeating Stephen Hendry 9–6 in the final. He also recorded a quarter-final run at the British Open, losing 3–5 to Peter Ebdon. At the UK Championship: O'Sullivan defeated Jimmy Michie 9–2 in the last 32, Dave Harold 9–5 in the last 16, Quinten Hann 9–5 in the quarter-finals, before losing to Williams 4–9 in the semi-finals. O'Sullivan then successfully defended his China Open title, defeating Williams 9–3 in the final. He became the seventh player in snooker history to defend a world-ranking tournament.\nIn the new year, O'Sullivan failed to reach the quarter-final stages of a ranking event for the first time this season: losing 4–5 to Joe Swail in the last 16 of the Welsh Open. This began a run of poor form that saw O'Sullivan lose in the opening round of the Masters 2–6 to Jimmy White and then in the second round of the Thailand Masters 4–5 to Shokat Ali (losing the deciding frame on a re-spotted black). O'Sullivan returned to winning ways, by capturing the Irish Masters title by defeating Stephen Hendry 9–8 in the final, before he experienced another dip in form losing to Mark Davis in the opening round of the Scottish Open.\nAt the World Championship, O'Sullivan showed no signs of this fluctuating form. He defeated Andy Hicks 10–2 in first round, Dave Harold 13–6 in the second, Peter Ebdon 13–6 in the quarter-finals, and Joe Swail 17–11 in the semi-finals to reach his first final after 9 years as a professional. In the final, he faced John Higgins. O'Sullivan established an early lead in the 35-frame final which he never relinquished, and eventually triumphed 18–14 for his first world title (completing his collection of major titles). O'Sullivan dedicated the win to his father. O'Sullivan ended the season by winning the Premier League. After finishing second in the league stage, he defeated Higgins 6–3 in the semi-finals, and Stephen Hendry 9–7 in the final. He was ranked world number 2 by the end of the season.\n2001/2002 season: UK Championship title, semi-final Crucible clash with Hendry, rise to world number 1.\nO'Sullivan began the 2001–02 season by trying to defend his Champions Cup and Scottish Masters titles. At the Champions Cup, he was eliminated in the group stages: defeating Jimmy White before losing to Ken Doherty and Peter Ebdon. At the Scottish Masters, he was defeated 6–9 by John Higgins in the final. O'Sullivan then reached the semi-finals of the British Open, losing to Graeme Dott 4–6. At the LG Cup, O'Sullivan compiled his fifth maximum break in competitive play in six minutes and 36 seconds on the way to a 5–1 defeat of Drew Henry in the last 16. This was the second fastest ever recorded behind his own at the 1997 World Championship. O'Sullivan then lost in the next round, falling 4–5 to Ebdon in the quarter-finals. O'Sullivan reached the quarter-finals of the European Open, before losing 4–5 to Stephen Hendry.\nO'Sullivan started his UK Championship campaign by defeating Ali Carter 9–2 in the last 32. In the last 16, leading 8–0 after winning all the frames in the first session, his opponent David Finbow withdrew from the match due to an anxiety attack. O'Sullivan then progressed to the final, after defeating Ebdon 9–8 from 4–8 behind in the quarter-finals and Mark Williams 9–6 in the semi-finals. Playing Ken Doherty in the final, O'Sullivan was dominant, winning his third UK title 10–1. With the victory, he joined an \"elite\" group of Davis, Hendry, Parrott and Higgins to win the World Championship and the UK Championship in the same calendar year.\nAt the Welsh Open, O'Sullivan was defeated in a final frame decider 4–5 by Paul Hunter in the last 16. At the Masters, O'Sullivan overcame Joe Swail 6–3 in the first round, before narrowly losing to Jimmy White 5–6 in a \"tense\" quarter-final after being 5–2 ahead. O'Sullivan did not defend his China Open title, losing 3–5 to Mark Selby in the quarter-finals. In the match, he played a series of reckless shots and conceded two frames before snookers were even required. O'Sullivan reached the semi-finals of the Thailand Masters, before losing to Williams by 2–5. O'Sullivan then suffered two early defeats at the Irish Masters and the Scottish Open. At the Irish Masters, where he was defending champion, he lost in his opening match in the quarter-finals 2–6 to Matthew Stevens. At the Scottish Open, he again lost in his opening match, this time in the first round 3–5 to Barry Hawkins.\nAs the defending champion at the World Championship for the first time, O'Sullivan sought to turn his recent bad form around and break the Crucible curse. O'Sullivan defeated Drew Henry 10–5 in the first round, Robert Milkins 13–2 in the second round, and Stephen Lee 13–10 in the quarter-finals to advance to the semi-finals where he faced Stephen Hendry. In a pre-match interview, O'Sullivan revealed that he had \"no respect\" for Hendry, referring to an incident during O'Sullivan's 13–17 semi-final defeat by Hendry three years prior, when the referee had awarded a miss that O'Sullivan felt Hendry should not have accepted. He further added that he wanted \"to send [Hendry] back home to Scotland\" to stop one of his former manager's players from winning the tournament, and that \"I know if I do get beat and [Hendry] comes up and does a moonie in front of me and goes 'Ne ne ne', I'll just look at him and say 'well done' and say 'go back to your sad little life'.\". In the match O'Sullivan took a 5–3 overnight lead after the first session, but Hendry fought back to level at 12–12 before the final session. Hendry subsequently outplayed O'Sullivan winning the semi-final 17 frames to 13. After the match, Hendry said it wasn't \"personal\" for him and he didn't remember the incident O'Sullivan described. O'Sullivan was unapologetic about the comments he made, saying it made a \"better atmosphere\" and \"what's better than a grudge match?\".\nO'Sullivan ended the season by defending his Premier League title. Having finished first after the league stage, O'Sullivan defeated Jimmy White 6–2 in the semi-final, and John Higgins 9–4 in the final. He began the 2002/2003 season ranked number 1.\n2002/2003 season: European Open and Irish Masters titles.\nO'Sullivan had another successful season in 2002/2003, reaching the last 16 in seven ranking tournaments. He began the season by winning the invitational Scottish Masters, defeating John Higgins 9–4 in the final. He reached the quarter-finals of the LG Cup, losing against eventual champion Chris Small; the last 16 of the British Open, losing against Paul Hunter, the quarter-finals of the UK Championship, losing against Drew Henry; and the quarter-finals of the Welsh Open, losing against Marco Fu. After this O'Sullivan won back-to-back ranking titles, defeating Hendry in the final of the European Open, and Higgins in the final of the Irish Masters. He reached the last 16 of the Scottish Open, before losing against Alan McManus. His only first-round ranking event defeat of the season came at the World Championship, when he lost 6–10 in the first round against the unseeded Marco Fu, despite making a maximum break in the match. This defeat saw him drop to number 3 in the rankings. He participated in the Premier League, but despite topping the table after the league stage, he lost 4–6 in the semi-final against Fu.\n2003/2004 season: second World Championship title and world number 1.\nIn the 2003–04 season, O'Sullivan reached three ranking-event finals. He reached the final of the British Open, but lost 6–9 against Stephen Hendry. He won the Welsh Open by defeating Steve Davis 9–8. He reached the final of the Masters, but lost 9–10 against Paul Hunter, despite having led 6–1 and then 9–7. His consistent form throughout the season earned him the £50,000 bonus for topping the LG Electronics Tour Order of Merit, a series of seven events – all the professional ranking tournaments in the campaign except for the World Championship. In 2004, O'Sullivan's father telephoned six-time World Champion Ray Reardon, and asked if he could give O'Sullivan some advice. With Reardon's help O'Sullivan recovered his form, and won the 2004 World Championship. He defeated Hendry 17–4 in the semi–finals, the most one-sided defeat ever in a World Championship semi–final. He then defeated Graeme Dott 18–8 in the final, despite losing the first five frames. O'Sullivan blamed his poor start on \"mind games\" by Dott's coach Derek Hill, who visited O'Sullivan's dressing room just before the match. O'Sullivan was ranked number one for the next two seasons. In late 2020, in a Eurosport special The Joy of Six, O'Sullivan told Colin Murray the interviewer that his poor start had been to do with being unsettled by seeing his past coach and friend Derek Hill in his opponent's corner. He had in fact been very angry at him felt it was a betrayal of sorts but his coach Ray Reardon was able to keep him focused enough to turn his game around and win.\n2004/2005 season: second Masters title.\nO'Sullivan began the 2004–05 season by winning the Grand Prix, defeating Ian McCulloch 9–5 in the final. He then reached the semi-finals of the British Open, losing 1–6 to Stephen Maguire, and the last 32 of the UK Championship, losing 6–9, once again against Maguire. In 2005, O'Sullivan defended his Welsh Open title, by defeating Stephen Hendry 9–8. During the tournament, O'Sullivan compiled ten century breaks, including a break of 146, the highest of the tournament. After this, he won his second Masters title, by defeating John Higgins 10–3. After the final, Higgins described O'Sullivan as a \"total genius\" because of ten breaks over 50 in the final including three centuries.\nO'Sullivan then won his third Irish Masters title, by defeating Matthew Stevens 10–8. He then missed the China Open on medical grounds; for which he was criticised by Anthony Hamilton, who said that O'Sullivan had a duty to promote the sport overseas. In the World Championship, O'Sullivan lost to Peter Ebdon in the quarter-final. From 2–8 down, Ebdon began a comeback and eventually won 13–11, by playing in an exceptionally determined and dogged style, with many observers accusing him of deliberate slow play to disrupt O'Sullivan's fast game. After the match, O'Sullivan indicated to the press that he was unlikely to compete in the following season, and would perhaps even retire from the sport altogether. O'Sullivan participated in the Premier League. After finishing third in the table after the league stage, O'Sullivan defeated Hendry 5–0 in the semi-finals, and Williams 6–0 in the final. In September 2005, he announced that he would play a truncated 2005/2006 season, spending some time playing eight-ball pool in the United States, having been chosen to compete on the elite International Pool Tour.\n2005/2006 season: Masters runner-up, troubled season.\nO'Sullivan began the 2005–06 season at the Grand Prix, and reached the final, but lost 2–9 against John Higgins. In his last-32 match with Mark King at the UK Championship, O'Sullivan sat with a wet towel draped over his head for most of the contest, and lost 8–9. He then successfully defended his Premier League title. Having finished first in the league stage, he defeated Steve Davis 5–3 in the semi-finals, and Stephen Hendry 6–0 in the final. O'Sullivan then reached the final of the Masters, but lost 9–10 against Higgins. In the deciding frame, he scored 60 points ahead before losing the vital red and Higgins, made a 64 clearance to win the match. O'Sullivan skipped the Malta Cup, and then lost his opening matches at the next two ranking events, as he lost 1–5 against Ian McCulloch at the Welsh Open and 0–5 against James Wattana at the China Open.\nThe 2006 World Championship began with O'Sullivan defeating Dave Harold 10–4, followed by a struggle through to a 13–10 win in his second-round match against Welshman Ryan Day. A similar quarter-final match ensued against Mark Williams. O'Sullivan led 10–6 going into the final session. A fightback by Williams saw him take the lead by winning the next five frames; but O'Sullivan held his nerve to take the match 13–11, and faced Graeme Dott in the semi–finals. Dott took an early lead before O'Sullivan drew level at 8–8 at the end of the second session. Cue-tip problems, which had dogged O'Sullivan throughout the event, recurred, including an incident in which television footage appeared to show O'Sullivan deliberately removing the tip of his cue. This secured him a 15-minute break to re-tip the cue, before he returned and made a 124 break. Tournament Director Mike Ganley accepted the player's assurance that the tip had simply fallen off, and no censure was made. The incident drew criticism from his opponent, and from Steve Davis and John Parrott. Dott then took all eight frames of the third session, leaving himself one frame away from his second final in three years. The final session saw O'Sullivan stage a minor fightback, taking three frames in a row, before a mistake let Dott back in for an eventual clearance on the black. After Dott's win, O'Sullivan gave his cue and case to a boy in the crowd. A BBC report claimed he had used as many as 21 different tips during the fortnight; O'Sullivan later stated that he had used seven tips before arriving in Sheffield, and a further eight during the week, and that he would return next season with a new cue. O'Sullivan's decision not to enter the Malta Cup cost him the number-one rank for the following season.\n2006/2007 season: third Masters title.\nOn his way to the final of the Northern Ireland Trophy, which he lost 6–9 to Ding Junhui, he defeated semi–final opponent Dominic Dale 6–0, in only 53 minutes—a record for a best-of-11-frames match. O'Sullivan then reached the quarter-finals of the Grand Prix, but lost 1–5 against eventual champion Neil Robertson. In December 2006, in his quarter-final match of the UK Championship against Hendry, O'Sullivan conceded in dramatic fashion part-way into the sixth frame of the best-of-17 match. He had gone 0–4 down after a strong start from Hendry, before finally taking a frame back. At the beginning of the sixth frame, O'Sullivan opened with a break of 24, before leaving himself a difficult shot from black to red. After missing the red, he calmly shook the hand of both Hendry (saying to him that he had \"had enough of it, mate\") and the match referee, Jan Verhaas, and walked out of the arena, stunning everyone present. The incident caused minor disruption to the other quarter-final match, between Graeme Dott and Steve Davis, being played simultaneously in the same arena. Dott later said that he initially thought that O'Sullivan and Hendry were having a fight when he heard an audience member shout \"Get a grip, Ronnie.\" It was later officially confirmed that O'Sullivan had forfeited the match, which was awarded 9–1 to Hendry. O’Sullivan issued a statement later that day, apologising and saying that he would be \"back on his feet fighting stronger and harder than ever very soon.\" On 31 May 2007, World Snooker fined him a total of £20,800 over this incident, and docked 900 ranking points from him.\nO'Sullivan returned to action at the Masters, to a mixed response from the audience (being both booed and clapped). He won his first round match 6–1 on 16 January 2007, against Ali Carter, making two century breaks in the process. However, he then created more controversy by failing to attend a post-match press conference. He did record a short interview with Steve Davis for the BBC, stating that he was much happier than at the UK Championship, and that he was playing well once again. Sir Rodney Walker later issued a statement declaring that O'Sullivan had been excused from dealing with the media because of the exceptional circumstances affecting him. This decision was criticised by Shaun Murphy. O'Sullivan went on to win the tournament against Ding Junhui, on 21 January 2007. In the match, he was noted for his good sportsmanship by Steve Davis, specifically for comforting Ding after the twelfth frame, during which Ding had become visibly upset by an overly partisan member of the crowd, who was later ejected. O'Sullivan was leading 9–3 at the time, and won the next frame for a 10–3 victory.\nO'Sullivan went out of the Malta Cup with a 3–5 loss to Michael Holt in the first round. He reached the quarter-finals of the Welsh Open, but lost 4–5 against Neil Robertson. In his quarter-final match against Joe Swail at the Irish Masters, O'Sullivan compiled a maximum break on his way to a narrow 5–4 victory, the second 147 in any professional competition in Ireland. The initial maximum break prize of a Citroën Coupe, worth €20,000, was later withdrawn by the organisers. He then defeated John Higgins 6–5 in the semi-finals, and won the title by defeating Barry Hawkins 9–1 in the final. O'Sullivan then reached the semi-finals of the China Open, but lost 2–6 against eventual champion Graeme Dott. Just before the World Championship, in which he was to play a first-round match with Ding Junhui again, O'Sullivan claimed that the draw was fixed. This was subsequently denied by World Snooker, and O'Sullivan later retracted his accusation. In the end, O'Sullivan won the tie easily by 10 frames to 2. He also won his second-round match against Robertson 13–10 (despite losing six frames in a row at one point), before losing his quarter-final match 9–13 against eventual champion John Higgins.\n2007/2008 season: fourth UK Championship and third World Championship title.\nO'Sullivan withdrew from the first ranking event of the season, the Shanghai Masters, citing back problems for which doctors had advised him not to travel. He also chose not to enter the invitational Pot Black tournament. He made the final of the Grand Prix, but lost 6–9 against Marco Fu. During the Northern Ireland Trophy, he set a new record by compiling five centuries in a 5–2 win over Ali Carter. This also included his seventh official competitive 147 maximum break. O'Sullivan went out of the tournament in the next round, having lost against Fergal O'Brien. On 2 December 2007, he won a fourth consecutive, and record seventh total, Premier League Snooker title, by beating John Higgins in the final by a score of 7–4. Earlier in the tournament, during his league stage match against Neil Robertson, he made the 500th competitive century break of his career. On 15 December 2007, O'Sullivan compiled his eighth maximum break in competition, in the deciding frame of his UK Championship semi–final against Mark Selby at Telford, equalling Hendry's record. In doing so, he also became only the third person in professional competition to compile a maximum to win a match. Hendry had made the first against O'Sullivan in the 1997 Charity Challenge final, and Mark Williams had made the second, at the Crucible in the first round of the 2005 World Championship. O'Sullivan is also the second player after John Higgins to make breaks of 147 in two consecutive ranking tournaments (2007 Northern Ireland Trophy and 2007 Maplin UK Championship). He then went on to win the tournament, beating Stephen Maguire 10–2 in the final (from 8–0 up), thereby receiving a £100,000 cheque for winning his first ranking tournament in almost three years.\nAt the Masters on 12 January, Stephen Maguire edged out O'Sullivan in a final frame to win their first-round match at Wembley. In a battle of the top two players in the provisional world rankings, O'Sullivan fought back from 1–4 down to level at 5–5 and take the match into a deciding eleventh frame. O'Sullivan missed the final blue with the rest, when poised to win the match, allowing Maguire to reach the quarter-finals. After withdrawing from the invitational Malta Cup, O'Sullivan returned at the Welsh Open in February. Playing a good tournament, he reached the final. Although he led 8–5, Selby won the last four frames to beat him 9–8. O'Sullivan was present at the China Open, in Beijing, where he lost 4–5 to Marco Fu in the first round. However, at the press conference, which followed the match, O'Sullivan was heard making some lewd remarks inviting a member of the press to perform fellatio on him, then laughing with the World Snooker media spokesman. O'Sullivan also joked about the size and girth of his penis, before simulating a sexual act on his microphone. In June 2008, the WPBSA punished him for his behaviour by docking the appearance money and world-ranking points that he had earned from the event.\nAt the 2008 World Championships, O'Sullivan compiled a record-breaking ninth competitive maximum break against Mark Williams. It was his third of the season, and also his third maximum at the Crucible. It was the fourth maximum to be compiled in a winning frame of a match (following those of Hendry, Williams, and O'Sullivan himself). Interviewed by Steve Davis just after beating Williams 13–7, he said \"I can finally buy a Bentley Continental GT\". Soon after O'Sullivan potted the final black, commentator Dennis Taylor called him a \"total genius\". However, O'Sullivan's 147 was equalled by Ali Carter in the same tournament, thus halving the prize money. O'Sullivan defeated Liu Chuang, Mark Williams, Liang Wenbo and Stephen Hendry \"en route\" to the final of the tournament. After the match, Hendry described O'Sullivan as \"the best in the world by a country mile\". He then beat Carter 18–8 to win the title on 5 May. In an interview after his third world title win, he hinted again that he might not play in the 2008/2009 season, but also stated that he might go on to pursue many more world titles. At the end of the season O'Sullivan left management company 110sport, to join the Romford-based Grove Leisure. In late 2020 in an interview show with Eurosport titled The Joy of Six where he is asked about each triumph on the biggest stage, he confessed his obnoxious antics in China not long before the World Championships was to give him a big incentive to focus on winning the tournament, a make or break moment for his career as he feared courting a bad reputation the way he did could lead to him being banned by organisers, threatening his very existence as a player so he was playing for survival so to speak, the ploy ended up paying extreme dividends with perhaps his most focused and best world championship run of his career.\n2008/2009 season: fourth Masters title.\nO'Sullivan began the 2008–09 season by winning the Northern Ireland Trophy, defeating Dave Harold 9–3 in the final. O'Sullivan is the only player to win back-to-back ranking events in the last four years. He then reached the final of the Shanghai Masters, having defeated Stephen Maguire in the semi–finals with two of the top breaks of 141 and 145. However, in the final, he was defeated 8–10 by qualifier Ricky Walden. In the Premier League, he secured a 7–2 win over Mark Selby, which meant that he had won the event eight times in total, and five times consecutively. However, O'Sullivan failed to defend his UK Championship title, losing to Joe Perry 5–9 in the second round. O'Sullivan had conceded the twelfth game of the match to go 5–7 down, although Perry held a lead of only 23 points to zero. Commenting afterwards, O'Sullivan said \"It might have looked like I lost my head or whatever, but I'm sure I'll bounce back.\" For this he was later fined £300, and was ordered to pay £1,000 in costs.\nIn the Masters, O'Sullivan reached the final by beating Joe Perry, Ali Carter and Stephen Maguire. In a tense final against defending champion Mark Selby, neither player was able to obtain a sizeable lead, with frames littered with both big breaks and close finishes. After leading 3–1, O'Sullivan ended the afternoon session at 4–4, and took the first frame of the evening session. Selby, however, then won the next 3 frames to lead 7–5. O'Sullivan responded by taking three frames in succession himself, to lead 8–7. The following two frames were shared, and at 9–8, after both players had wasted chances, O'Sullivan constructed a break of 55, beating Mark Selby 10–8 and thereby claiming the title for the fourth time. In doing this he became only the second player, after Stephen Hendry, to win the trophy more than three times. In his post-match interview, O'Sullivan proclaimed his victory, composed with a cue that he had obtained only the previous Saturday, as his greatest achievement in snooker. During an exhibition in Ireland in January 2009, O'Sullivan and Jimmy White made maximum breaks in consecutive frames. In the first round of the 2009 World Championship O'Sullivan compiled three centuries in his 10–5 win against Stuart Bingham. O'Sullivan compiled a 140 break in the second, a 104 in the eighth, and a 103 in the 14th. He was defeated in the second round 11–13, by Mark Allen, after having led 9–7.\n2009/2010 season: Masters runner-up.\nHe began the season by winning the Shanghai Masters, defeating Liang Wenbo 10–5 in the final. On the way to the final, he lost only 6 frames. He beat Graeme Dott 5–0 in the first round, Marco Fu 5–2 in the second round, Ding Junhui 5–3 in the quarter-finals, and John Higgins 6–1 in the semi–finals. After his Shanghai Masters victory, he joined the newly founded Snooker Players Association. In the second ranking event, the Grand Prix, he beat Jamie Burnett 5–3 in the first round, but then lost narrowly against John Higgins in the second round, by 4–5. On 29 November 2009, O'Sullivan did not retain his Premier League Snooker title, with Shaun Murphy defeating him 7–3 in the final. Following his 9–3 victory over Matthew Stevens in the first round of the UK Championship on 7 December 2009, O'Sullivan caused controversy in his post-match press conference. He described the outgoing regime at the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (headed by Sir Rodney Walker) as \"a cancer running through the game\", and also said \"leukaemia has set in\". He went on to endorse the new era of snooker, headed by Barry Hearn. He then won his next two matches, 9–3 against Peter Ebdon in the last 16, and Mark Selby in the quarter-finals, before losing the semi–final 8–9 to John Higgins, despite having come back from 2–8 to 8–8.\nO'Sullivan began the defence of his Masters title by defeating Neil Robertson 6–4 in the first round, after having trailed 0–3. After this, he defeated Peter Ebdon 6–3 in the quarter-final. In the semi-final he beat Mark Williams 6–5, to reach his sixth Masters final in seven years. O'Sullivan met Mark Selby in the final for the second consecutive year, and lost 9–10 despite having led 9–6. In the Welsh Open, he reached the semi–finals by beating Stuart Bingham 5–1 in the first round, Jamie Cope 5–0 in the second round, and Mark Allen 5–2 in the quarter-finals, but lost 4–6 against John Higgins in the semi–finals. O'Sullivan lost 3–5 in the first round of the China Open, against 22-year-old wild card Tian Pengfei. With this, he also lost his chance to defend his official World No. 1 spot. At the World Championship, he defeated Liang Wenbo 10–7 in the first round and Mark Williams 13–10 in the second round, before losing 11–13 to Mark Selby in the quarter-finals.\n2010/2011 season.\nO'Sullivan began the 2010–11 season at Event 1 of the Players Tour Championship, where he lost 0–4 in the quarter-finals against Jamie Cope. O'Sullivan next competed at Event 4, where he reached the final, but he lost 3–4 against Barry Pinches. At the World Open O'Sullivan made his record 10th maximum break in the last frame of his match against Mark King, which he won 3–0. However, he had to be persuaded by referee Jan Verhaas to play the final black, as he had become aware that there was no distinct prize money for a maximum break in the tournament, but only a prize of £4,000 for the highest break. Even then, he played the final black in a nonchalant fashion. O'Sullivan then defeated Jimmy White (3–1), Stephen Hendry (3–1), Stephen Maguire (3–1) and Peter Ebdon (3–1) to reach the final, where he lost 1–5 against Neil Robertson. O'Sullivan participated at the Premier League Snooker, and qualified for the finals unbeaten. He then defeated Neil Robertson 5–1 in the semi-finals, and Shaun Murphy 7–1 in the final, to claim his ninth Premier League Snooker title in 14 years. In the UK Championship in December, O'Sullivan suffered an early exit, losing 6–9 against Stuart Bingham in the first round.\nAt the Masters in January, O'Sullivan went out 4–6 in the first round against Mark Allen. O'Sullivan reached the semi-finals in the Snooker Shoot-Out in January 2011, before losing against Robert Milkins. He made the two highest breaks of the tournament, 112 and 123. He then lost in the first round of the next two ranking tournaments, both times against Ryan Day. He lost 2–4 at the Welsh Open, and 2–5 at the China Open. He reached the quarter-finals of the World Championship by defeating Dominic Dale 10–2 in the first round and Shaun Murphy 13–10 in the second round, but lost 10–13 against eventual winner John Higgins.\n2011/2012 season: fourth World Championship title.\nO'Sullivan began the 2011–12 season at Event 1 of the Players Tour Championship, where he won 4–0 in the final against Joe Perry. At the Paul Hunter Classic, he made the 11th official maximum break of his career, and set a new record of career maximum breaks. He reached the semi-finals, but lost 3–4 against Mark Selby. His next tournament was the Shanghai Masters, where he reached the second round, but lost 3–5 against Anthony Hamilton. In October 2011 he won the Kay Suzanne Memorial Trophy, by defeating Matthew Stevens 4–2 in the final. In November 2011 he reached the final of the Antwerp Open, but lost 3–4 against Judd Trump. After 12 of 12 events, O'Sullivan was ranked number two on the Order of Merit, and qualified for the Finals, but withdrew due to medical reasons.\nO'Sullivan won the 10th Premier League title of his career, a record number of wins for any tournament in the modern era. After topping the table in the league stage, he defeated Mark Williams to reach the final, where he defeated Ding Junhui 7–1. His next tournament was the UK Championship, where he lost in the second round 5–6 against eventual champion Judd Trump. At the Masters, he again lost against Trump, this time 2–6 in the quarter-finals. At the German Masters, he reached his first ranking final since the 2010 World Open, and won 9–7 against Stephen Maguire, despite having trailed 0–4 against Andrew Higginson in the first round. He then reached the semi-finals of the Welsh Open, and the quarter-finals of the China Open, but lost 2–6 against Mark Selby and 4–5 against Maguire.\nAt the World Championship O'Sullivan saw off former world champions in each of his first three matches. He beat Peter Ebdon 10–4 in the first round, Mark Williams 13–6 in the second, and Neil Robertson 13–10 in the quarter-finals. He beat two-time runner-up Matthew Stevens 17–10 in the semi-finals, and defeated Ali Carter 18–11 in the final, to win his fourth world title. Aged 36, and just 40 days older than Dennis Taylor was when he won the title in 1985, O'Sullivan became the oldest world champion since 45-year-old Ray Reardon in 1978. In the eighth frame of the final, O'Sullivan made a break of 141, the highest break ever recorded in a Crucible final. He was ranked world number nine at the end of the season. On 10 May 2012, O'Sullivan was named as the World Snooker Player of the Year and the Snooker Writers Player of the Year. He was also inducted into the Hall of Fame, along with Walter Donaldson, Mark Williams and John Higgins.\n2012/2013 season: extended break and fifth World Championship title.\nOn 6 June, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association released a statement announcing that O'Sullivan had not signed the official players' contract and would therefore not be eligible to play in any 2012–13 World Snooker event until he did so. On the same day O'Sullivan said that he found the contract \"too onerous\" and that he was in a stage of his career where he did not wish to make the commitment. On 7 August it was announced that he had now signed the contract and would be playing in October's International Championship and December's UK Championship. After the Shanghai Masters he dropped out of the top sixteen for the first time since entering it in the 1994–95 season, as he was ranked world number 17. O'Sullivan's return to snooker was short-lived, as he withdrew from the inaugural International Championship due to advice from his doctor not to travel. On 6 November O'Sullivan announced that he had withdrawn from every event he had entered and that he would not play for the remainder of the season. However, on 26 February O'Sullivan announced during a press conference that he would return to the game and defend his World Championship title.\nAt the Crucible O'Sullivan defeated Marcus Campbell in the last 32, Ali Carter in the last 16, Stuart Bingham in the quarter-finals and Judd Trump in the semi-finals. During the third session in frame 23 after missing a red he appears to make a lewd gesture with his cue and was issued a verbal warning by referee Michaela Tabb, O'Sullivan insisted his cue was sticky and he was merely wiping it. While his concentration seemed to be affected with him losing the frame he went on to win the match comfortably and so he reached the final without falling behind even once, and defeated Barry Hawkins 18–12 to win his fifth world title. O'Sullivan's break of 103 in the 15th frame was his 128th century break at the Crucible Theatre, breaking Stephen Hendry's record of 127 Crucible centuries. During the final he extended the record to 131 century breaks. O'Sullivan became the only player to score six century breaks in a World Championship final. He also became only the third player to retain his title at the Crucible after Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry.\nHowever, after his title win, O'Sullivan refused definitively to rule out a title defence in 2014, saying in a post-match interview that \"I just love playing, so I will definitely be playing in some smaller events, and we will just see what goes on.\"\n2013/2014 season: fifth Masters title and World Championship runner-up.\nO'Sullivan started the 2013–14 season ranked number 19. Although he was out of the top 16, winning the World Championship the previous season allowed him to be seeded in every tournament he decided to enter (number 1 in World Championship 2014 and number 2, behind the defending champion, for all the others. For personal reasons, he pulled out of the first ranking tournament of the season, the Wuxi Classic, shortly before he was due to face Michael Wasley in the qualifying round. In June 2013 he competed in the Bulgarian Open, his first tournament appearance outside England in 15 months, but lost 2–4 against John Higgins in the semi-finals. He went on to win the Paul Hunter Classic by defeating Gerard Greene 4–0 in the final. O'Sullivan then qualified for the International Championship by defeating Joel Walker 6–1 in the qualifying round, and defeated Anthony McGill 6–2 at the venue, before losing 4–6 against Liang Wenbo in the last 32. After that O'Sullivan reached the final of the Antwerp Open, but lost 3–4 against Mark Selby, despite leading 3–1. In the Champion of Champions he defeated Ding Junhui and Neil Robertson in final frame deciders and went on to win the title by defeating Stuart Bingham 10–8 in the final. He reached the quarter-finals of the UK Championship, but lost 4–6 against Bingham, despite making breaks of 135 and 127 in the match.\nAt the Masters, O'Sullivan defeated Robert Milkins 6–1 in the first round, before he whitewashed Ricky Walden 6–0 in the quarter-finals, a match that lasted just 57 minutes and 48 seconds. During the match he scored 556 points without reply, a new record in a professional event, beating the previous record of 495 points set by Ding Junhui at the 2007 Premier League Snooker. He defeated Stephen Maguire 6–2 in the semi-finals to reach a record tenth Masters final, surpassing the nine appearances by Stephen Hendry. Facing defending champion Mark Selby in the final, he took a 7–1 lead in the first session, before going on to a 10–4 victory for his fifth Masters title. On 22 January 2014, the Disciplinary Committee of the WPBSA issued a statement that O'Sullivan had been found in breach of the association's Members Rules. It fined him £6,000 and ordered him to pay £1,000 in costs over three posts on his personal Twitter account, made in September and October 2013, that it deemed damaging to the image of the sport. The first post related to match-fixing allegations, the second to a suggestion that he had used performance-enhancing drugs, and the third to a tweet that was described as \"offensive\". The committee fined him an additional £1,000 for making \"abusive, insulting and disrespectful\" comments to referee Jan Verhaas during the December 2013 qualifying round for the German Masters. The incident arose after Verhaas asked O'Sullivan to tuck his shirt in during the match. O'Sullivan apologised for his conduct with the referee, stating that he felt unwell on the day and that the venue was overly warm.\nAt the Welsh Open, O'Sullivan defeated Ricky Walden 4–1 in the last 16, John Higgins 5–1 in the quarter-finals, and Barry Hawkins 6–2 in the semi-finals. He defeated Ding Junhui 9–3 in the final to win his third Welsh Open title, and the 26th ranking title of his career. In the last frame of the final, he compiled a record 12th maximum break in professional competition, breaking the previous record of 11 maximum breaks that he had held jointly with Stephen Hendry. During the season O'Sullivan competed at the Players Tour Championship, and finished second on the European Tour Order of Merit, to qualify for the Players Championship Grand Final. There he defeated Scott Donaldson 4–0 in the last 32, but lost 3–4 against Yu Delu in the last 16, despite making a 140, the highest break of the tournament.\nAt the World Championship, O'Sullivan began his title defence by beating Robin Hull 10–4 in the first round. Playing Joe Perry in the second round, O'Sullivan was behind for the first two sessions, but recovered to win the match 13–11. Up against Shaun Murphy in the 16th World Championship quarter-final of his career, O'Sullivan took 13 of the last 14 frames to win the match 13–3, with a session to spare. He defeated Barry Hawkins 17–7 in the semi-finals, also with a session to spare, to reach his sixth World Championship final. Facing Mark Selby in the final, O'Sullivan began strongly, taking a 10–5 lead, but lost 10 of the next 12 frames to trail 12–15. The third session was particularly grindy with only 6 frames played in the session instead of 8. The crucial final frame would have been O'Sullivan's for a 1 frame lead going into the final session but he drastically overhit the pink clearing the colours, failing to pot it perhaps as a result of misinterpreting the scoreboard as the pink was frameball. He went on to lose 14–18, his first ever defeat in a World Championship final. At around 1:30 a.m., on their way home from the final, O'Sullivan and his six-year-old son were involved in a car crash. Neither O'Sullivan nor his son were injured. After the World Championship, a new ranking system took effect, based on a two-year rolling prize money list rather than ranking points. This meant that O'Sullivan ended the season ranked number 4.\n2014/2015 season: fifth UK Championship title.\nO'Sullivan started the 2014–15 season at the Paul Hunter Classic, but lost 2–4 against Tian Pengfei in the last 16. His first ranking event was the Shanghai Masters, where he lost 3–5 against Alan McManus.\nRonnie O'Sullivan then competed in the International Championship, cited as the biggest event in Asia, in Chengdu after beating James Cahill to qualify. Having battled to beat Ben Woollaston 6–4, in his opening match of the tournament, Ronnie sailed past his next two opponents, McGill and Li Hang, 6–1. This set up a meeting with Mark Williams, a man who had not beat O'Sullivan for 12 years, in the quarters; however, after falling 3–0 behind, Williams won the next 5 frames and eventually the match, 6–5. O'Sullivan next competed in the Champion of Champions where he was defending champion. O'Sullivan begun his defence with a 4–2 defeat of Stuart Bingham. He then went on to whitewash Marco Fu 6–0 to reach the semi-final. In the semi-final, O'Sullivan defeated Ding Junhui 6–4 and then went on to defeat Judd Trump in a high-scoring final, 10–7, making four century breaks and eleven breaks over fifty during the match. On 4 December 2014, O'Sullivan completed his 13th career maximum break in the fourth round of the UK Championship, against Matthew Selt. Three days later he won his fifth UK Championship, coming through 10–9 against Judd Trump in the final. After trailing 1–5 and 4–9, Trump won five frames in succession, before O'Sullivan prevailed in the deciding frame despite playing with a broken ankle, having broken it the previous week whilst running.\nIn the semi-finals he was defeated 1–6 by Neil Robertson, which meant O'Sullivan lost at that stage for the first time in his Masters' career after 10 prior victories and also ended a winning streak in all competitions which stood at 15 matches. However he did equal and overtake Stephen Hendry's record of 775 centuries earlier in the tournament, Ronnie's 775th century needing a fluked yellow on the baulk cushion to keep the break going to clear up to blue on the colours to make the century break.\nIn the World Championship, O'Sullivan defeated Craig Steadman 10–3 in the first round and Matthew Stevens 13–5 in the second round, but suffered a 9–13 defeat to Stuart Bingham in the quarter-finals. O'Sullivan was involved in many incidents during the tournament. While playing Steadman, he breached snooker's dress code when he removed a pair of uncomfortable shoes and played briefly in his socks, before borrowing shoes from tournament director Mike Ganley. \nIn his match with Stevens, frustrated at missing a shot, he almost snapped his cue in half by hitting it against the table. In his quarter-final match, O'Sullivan placed his chalk on the table and used it to line up a shot. Controversially, referee Terry Camilleri did not penalize him for the incident, even though many commentators, including former world champion Ken Doherty and former tour referee Michaela Tabb, argued that under the rules of snooker the referee should have called a 7-point foul. These incidents led Stephen Hendry to say that O'Sullivan was not fully focused. \"Personally I think it is a sign he has got other things on his mind,\" said Hendry. \"He is not focused properly on winning the World Championship.\"\n2015/2016 season: sixth Masters title.\nO'Sullivan won the pro–am Pink Ribbon tournament in July 2015, defeating Darryn Walker 4–2 in the final, but took a hiatus from the professional tour for almost eight months. He declined to defend his Champion of Champions and UK Championship titles, stating that he was suffering from debilitating insomnia, but he made his debut providing in-studio expert analysis during the UK Championship, alongside Jimmy White. He returned to professional competition in the qualifying rounds for the German Masters in December 2015, defeating Hamza Akbar 5–1 in the first round, but losing 3–5 to Stuart Carrington in the second round.\nIn the 2016 New Year Honours, he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his services to snooker.\nIn group one of the Championship League, he made the 800th competitive century break of his career in his match against Barry Hawkins, and went on to defeat Ricky Walden 3–0 in the semi-finals and Robert Milkins 3–0 in the final, earning a ticket to the winners' group. At the Masters, he defeated Mark Williams 6–5 in the first round, Mark Selby 6–3 in the quarter-finals, and Stuart Bingham 6–3 in the semi-finals to reach the eleventh Masters final of his career. He defeated Barry Hawkins 10–1 in the final to win his sixth Masters title and equal Stephen Hendry's record for the most Masters wins.\nAt the Welsh Open, O'Sullivan defeated Barry Pinches 4–1 in the first round. In the fifth frame of the match, O'Sullivan declined the opportunity to make a maximum break, potting the pink off the penultimate red and completing a break of 146. He stated afterward that the prize money of £10,000 was not worthy of a 147. World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn called the decision \"unacceptable\" and \"disrespectful\". In the second round, he defeated Tian Pengfei 4–0 in just 39 minutes, with breaks of 110, 90, 112 and 102 in the four frames played. Tian scored only 37 points in the match. In the third round, he defeated Jimmy Robertson 4–0 in 55 minutes, a performance that included breaks of 94 and 131 as part of a run of 300 points without reply. He defeated Yu Delu 4–1 in the last 16, and then defeated world number one Mark Selby 5–1 in the quarter-finals, finishing with a break of 132. A 6–3 victory over Joe Perry in the semi-final secured a place in the final against Neil Robertson. Despite trailing 3–5 after the afternoon session, O'Sullivan won all six frames played in the evening session, finishing with a break of 141 to defeat Robertson 9–5 and equal John Higgins's record of four Welsh Open titles. It was his 28th ranking title, which put him in joint second place with Higgins and Steve Davis for the number of career ranking titles. Over the tournament as a whole, O'Sullivan won 36 of the 47 frames he played, and compiled ten century breaks.\nAt the Championship League, O'Sullivan lost 2–3 in the final against Judd Trump. During the tournament, O'Sullivan's 24-match winning streak came to an end following a 0–3 defeat by Mark Williams. O'Sullivan faced Michael Holt in the first round of the World Grand Prix and lost 3–4.\nIn the World Championship, O'Sullivan beat David Gilbert 10–7 in the first round. After the match, he refused to attend a mandatory press conference, and also refused to talk to the tournament broadcasters, the BBC. He received a formal warning from World Snooker, and was advised that further breaches of contract would lead to fines. In the second round, he lost 12–13 to Barry Hawkins, his first loss against Hawkins in 14 years and only the second time in 13 years that he had failed to reach the World Championship quarter-finals.\n2016/2017 season: UK Championship runner-up and record seventh Masters title.\nO'Sullivan began the 2016–17 season late, at the Shanghai Masters. In the first round, he defeated Liang Wenbo 5–4 after recovering from 1–4 down. It was his first professional tournament match in five months. However, this was as far as he progressed, as in the second round he lost by 2–5 to Michael Holt. Competing in the inaugural European Masters, O'Sullivan defeated David Gilbert 4–1 in the first round, Mark Allen 4–2 in the second round, Mark Davis 4–1 in the quarter-finals and then whitewashed Neil Robertson 6–0 in the semi-final. Facing Judd Trump in the final, O'Sullivan took a 5–3 lead after the first session. In the second session, O'Sullivan further led 8–6 before eventually losing 8–9. In the first of the Home Nations series of tournaments, at the inaugural English Open, O'Sullivan defeated Jimmy Robertson 4–0 in the first round, Zhao Xintong 4–3 in the second, but then lost to Chris Wakelin in the third by 3–4. At the International Championship, O'Sullivan beat Xiao Guodong 6–4 in the first round and Kurt Maflin 6–4 in the second to reach the last 16. However, he was then defeated by Michael Holt 4–6, making this the third consecutive loss to Holt in 2016.\nO'Sullivan returned to action in the Champion of Champions. He won his group by defeating Robin Hull 4–2 in the first round and Martin Gould 6–2 in the second, and he then beat Mark Allen 6–2 in the semi-final with an impressive performance including three century breaks. O'Sullivan however could not reproduce the same form in the final and lost 7–10 to John Higgins. At the inaugural Northern Ireland Open, O'Sullivan defeated David John 4–1 in the first round, Jimmy White 4–1 in the second, and Zhang Anda 4–0 in the third. Kyren Wilson then edged out O'Sullivan 3–4 in the fourth round after O'Sullivan had staged a comeback with three consecutive century breaks after going 0–3 behind.\nAt the UK Championship, O'Sullivan produced dominant displays in the opening rounds defeating Boonyarit Keattikun 6–0 in the first, Rhys Clark 6–0 in the second and Michael Georgiou 6–1 in the third. He then beat Matthew Stevens 6–2 in the fourth round, Mark Williams 6–2 in the quarter-finals, and Marco Fu 6–5 in a tense semi-final, winning the deciding frame with a decisive break of 130. In the final, O'Sullivan played Mark Selby. In the first session after O'Sullivan went 2–1 up, Selby took advantage of errors by O'Sullivan to win 5 straight frames. However, in a high quality second session, O'Sullivan fought back to close to within one frame at 7–8, but Selby prevailed winning the next two frames and the title 7–10. In the last six frames of the match, a total of 5 century breaks were made, 2 by O'Sullivan of 134 and 130. This defeat marked the first time O'Sullivan had lost in a UK Championship final and the third consecutive defeat in a major final in this season.\nO'Sullivan ended 2016 at the Scottish Open. He defeated Matthew Selt 4–2 in the first round, Adam Stefanow 4–1 in the second, Jimmy White 4–2 in the third and Mark Allen 4–2 in the last 16. He was then beaten 2–5 by John Higgins in the quarter-finals.\nIn the new year, O'Sullivan returned to the Masters as the defending champion. He defeated Liang Wenbo 6–5 in a dramatic first-round match. In the tenth frame, Liang missed the final black in a clearance which would have given him victory. After potting the black, O'Sullivan went on to produce a break of 121 in the deciding frame to win the match. O'Sullivan then beat Neil Robertson 6–3 in the quarter-finals, and Marco Fu 6–4 in the semi-finals to reach his twelfth Masters final despite problems with his cue tip. In the final, he defeated Joe Perry 10–7 to win his seventh Masters title, setting the record for the most number of title wins at the tournament. After the tournament, O'Sullivan received a disciplinary letter from World Snooker over comments he made to the press after his match with Fu. He criticised referee Terry Camilleri's performance and a photographer during post-match interviews. This led to O'Sullivan stating that he would no longer give in-depth answers in interviews or press conferences, claiming \"when I share my thoughts, I risk being fined\".\nAt the German Masters, O'Sullivan lost 4–5 to Mark King in the last 32 despite leading 4–1. O'Sullivan entered the World Grand Prix seeded fifth on the one-year ranking list. He defeated Yan Bingtao 4–2 in the first round, but lost 1–4 to Neil Robertson in the second. In the final event of the Home Nations series, the Welsh Open, O'Sullivan progressed past Tom Ford 4–1 in the first round. His defence was then ended early by Mark Davis, who beat him 3–4 in the second round after O'Sullivan had led 3–0.\nO'Sullivan entered the Players Championship seeded 7th on the one-year ranking list. He defeated Liang Wenbo 5–1 in the first round, but was defeated 3−5 by Judd Trump in the quarter-finals. At the China Open, O'Sullivan defeated Gareth Allen 5−0 in the first round, but was then upset 4−5 by Mark Joyce in the second.\nOn the eve of the World Championships, O'Sullivan attended the 40th anniversary celebration of the Crucible Theatre holding the World Snooker Championship as a past champion. O'Sullivan then faced debutant Gary Wilson in the first round. He won five of the first six frames before Wilson fought back by winning three consecutive frames to trail by only 4−5 at the end of the first session. In a high scoring second session, O'Sullivan went on to defeat Wilson 10−7 and celebrated by repeatedly punching the air. Speaking to the media at length for the first time since the Masters, O'Sullivan attacked the WPBSA during his post-match press conference for using \"threatening\" language in communications with him and said he would no longer be \"bullied\" by the governing body in future. Jason Ferguson, chairman of the WPBSA, and Barry Hearn, chairman of World Snooker, denied the allegations. Past champions John Higgins and Stuart Bingham backed O'Sullivan with Higgins expressing \"sympathy\" for him and Bingham saying \"he had a point\". However, 2005 champion Shaun Murphy claimed that O'Sullivan's comments were \"completely wrong\". This added further intrigue ahead of the second round clash of O'Sullivan and Murphy. O'Sullivan later issued a statement saying he would \"not be making any further comment\" during the Championships and would instead focus on his \"quest for a sixth world title\".\nDuring his second round match, O'Sullivan opened up a four frame advantage over Murphy in the first session to lead 6−2. In the second session, O'Sullivan maintained his advantage to lead 10−6 going into the final session. The third session saw no comeback from Murphy and O'Sullivan progressed to the quarter-finals 13−7. The quarter-finals would be the furthest O'Sullivan would progress, as he fell behind Ding Junhui 6–10 after the opening two sessions. Despite scoring the tournament's highest break with a 146 in the final session, he would eventually lose 10–13. Following his loss, O'Sullivan stated that he had no intention of retiring.\n2017–18 season: five ranking titles, including record-equalling sixth UK Championship title.\nThe 2017/2018 snooker season saw a return to winning ways for O'Sullivan, capturing joint record five world ranking titles including his 6th UK Championship title. This saw O'Sullivan match Steve Davis' record of six UK titles and Stephen Hendry's record of 18 major titles. This haul marked a personal best for O'Sullivan, with him only previously winning at most three world ranking titles in a single season (2004–05 season). His ranking rose from world no. 14 at the beginning of the season to world no. 2 at the end of the season. O'Sullivan credited his achievements this season to a focus on match snooker.\nO'Sullivan reached the final of the invitational Hong Kong Masters after defeating John Higgins and Judd Trump in final frame deciders, before falling to Neil Robertson. In October, after defeating John Higgins 4–3 in a closely fought last 16 contest at the English Open, O'Sullivan romped through the final stages to capture the title, defeating Kyren Wilson 9–2 in the final with a pot success of 98% in the final. O'Sullivan reached his fourth final in five years at the invitational Champion of Champions, compiling his 900th career total century break along the way. He was defeated by Shaun Murphy 8–10, after fighting back from 5–9 down. At the very next tournament though, he won the Shanghai Masters 10–3 against Judd Trump in the final. This was his first title in China since the 2009 Shanghai Masters.\nAt the first major of the season, the UK championship, a struggling O'Sullivan survived a close final frame encounter with Sunny Akani in the last 16 at the UK Championship, before powering to the title, defeating Martin Gould 6–3, Stephen Maguire 6–4 and then Shaun Murphy 10–5 to win the championship for a record-equalling sixth time. In January 2018, in the first round at The Masters, O'Sullivan recorded a 6–0 whitewash over Marco Fu, compiling three century breaks and scoring 649 points to Fu's 35. However, he was knocked out in the following round by eventual winner Mark Allen, 1–6.\nAt the World Grand Prix, O'Sullivan defeated Ding Junhui 10–3 in the final. In the quarter-finals, he had compiled four centuries in a 5–0 whitewash of Xiao Guodong. Then, after triumphing over defending champion Judd Trump 6–5 in a high quality semi-final match, O'Sullivan also captured the Players Championship, defeating Shaun Murphy for a second time in a final this season, 10–4.\nO'Sullivan made his 14th career total maximum break at the China Open in the match against Elliot Slessor, although he ultimately lost 2–6. He ended the season on a disappointing note, losing in the World Championship to rival Ali Carter, in an ill-tempered match that saw the players shoulder-barge each other when passing at the table. This was the first time Carter had beaten O'Sullivan in a professional match, besides a win in the group stages of the non-ranking 2010 Championship League.\n2018–19 season: record seventh UK title and record 19 Triple Crown titles, thirteenth Masters final, 1000th century, return to world number one and a record-equalling 36th ranking title.\nO'Sullivan defended his Shanghai Masters title by beating Barry Hawkins 11–9 in the final. This was O'Sullivan's first tournament of the season. The win made O'Sullivan the first snooker player to surpass £10 million in career prize money. He then competed in the English Open, during which he made his fifteenth maximum break to clinch a 4–0 victory over Allan Taylor in the second round. O'Sullivan reached the semi-finals but lost 1–6 to an in-form Mark Davis. At the Champion of Champions, O'Sullivan reached his fifth consecutive final and won 10–9 in a final frame decider against Kyren Wilson, having made 11 centuries during the event. His next tournament was the Northern Ireland Open and faced Judd Trump in the final. He lost the match 7–9. O'Sullivan won the UK Championship with a 10–6 victory over Mark Allen in the final, marking his record seventh UK Championship title and a record of nineteen Triple Crown titles overall. Less than 24 hours after his win, O'Sullivan withdrew from the Scottish Open.\nAt the 2019 Masters, O'Sullivan showed good form in reaching another Masters Final, beating Stuart Bingham 6–2 in round one and then recording 6–3 victories over Ryan Day and Ding Junhui in the quarter-finals and semi finals respectively. In the final, however, O'Sullivan was comprehensively outplayed by in-form Judd Trump; trailing 1–7 after the first of two sessions, O'Sullivan made two centuries in the evening session but was eventually defeated 4–10, his biggest loss in a Masters Final.\nO'Sullivan reached another final at the Players Championship. He overcame Barry Hawkins in the first round, winning 6–4 before winning another close match against Higgins by the same score. O'Sullivan's semi final was a much easier affair; he whitewashed an out-of-sorts Allen 6–0 under difficult playing conditions, with the state of the table being criticised by TV commentators, to set up a final against Neil Robertson . O'Sullivan dominated the final and took a 7–2 lead into the evening session, making breaks of 116 and 105 to see his tally of career centuries stand at 999. O'Sullivan rounded off a 10–4 victory by scoring his 1000th century break in the winning frame, becoming the first player in snooker history to reach this milestone.\nAt the Tour Championship, O'Sullivan eased through Stuart Bingham 9−3, then came back from 6−2 down and 8−5 down to defeat Judd Trump 10−9 in a match that went to the final black. In a rematch of the Players Championship final 2 weeks before, O'Sullivan defeated Neil Robertson 13−11 to claim his 36th ranking title, equalling Stephen Hendry's record. This win also catapulted O'Sullivan back to world number one, 9 years since he last held the spot.\nAt the World Championship, O'Sullivan suffered a shock first-round defeat at the hands of 23-year-old debutant James Cahill, who was also the first amateur ever to compete at the Crucible. O'Sullivan trailed 4−5 after the first session, then fell 5−8 behind before rallying to level the match at 8−8. However, Cahill won the final two frames to record a 10−8 victory. It was O'Sullivan's fourth first-round loss in his 27 Crucible campaigns.\n2019–20 season: sixth World Championship title (record 37th ranking title).\nO'Sullivan once again defended his Shanghai Masters title by beating Shaun Murphy 11–9 in the final. It was O'Sullivan's first tournament of the season just like previous season. His first appearance in a ranking event was the 2019 English Open, where he lost 3–4 to Mei Xiwen in the last 16.\nAfter failing to qualify for the 2019 World Open, O'Sullivan performed at the 2019 Champion of Champions, where he won his group after beating Jimmy White 4–3 and John Higgins 6–3 before being beaten 5–6 by Neil Robertson. It was the first time when O'Sullivan entered the Champion of Champions tournament and failed to reach the final. He then reached the final of the 2019 Northern Ireland Open, where he lost 7–9 to Judd Trump in a high-quality match which included six century breaks and three maximum break attempts. He then tried to defend his UK Championship title, but lost 4–6 to eventual tournament winner Ding Junhui in the last 16. One week later, O'Sullivan reached the quarter-finals of the 2019 Scottish Open, where he lost 4–5 to Mark Selby, despite making three centuries in that match.\nDespite his ranking, he chose not to accept an invitation to play in the 2020 Masters invitational event. O'Sullivan's first performance in 2020 was the World Grand Prix, where he was beaten 3–5 by Graeme Dott. He then reached the semi-finals of the 2020 Welsh Open in which he lost 5–6 to Kyren Wilson. He also played at the 2020 Snooker Shoot Out where he lost in the second round to Billy Joe Castle. Due to a lack of earnings in ranking tournaments over the course of the season, he was unable to defend the Players Championship, as he was pipped to the last remaining place by the two finalists of the Shoot Out.\nAfter the prolonged break caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, O'Sullivan returned to action at the 2020 Championship League. There he won his group without losing a single frame before going out of the tournament in the group winners' stage. He was unable to compete in the 2020 Tour Championship.\nAt the 2020 World Snooker Championship, O'Sullivan made his 28th consecutive appearance at the Crucible, beating Stephen Hendry's previous record of 27. He started the tournament by beating Thepchaiya Un-Nooh 10–1 in the fastest match in Crucible history which lasted just 108 minutes. He then beat Ding Junhui and Mark Williams (after being 2-7 and 4-8 down) 13–10 each to reach his twelfth Crucible semifinal, where he faced Mark Selby. O'Sullivan won the first session 5–3, but lost 10 out of the next 14 frames to trail 9–13. O'Sullivan won the next four frames to level the match, but then fell behind 14–16 before making breaks of 138 and 71 to take the match to a deciding frame. O'Sullivan made a 64 break before missing a red to the green pocket. Selby scored 34 points before a safety battle on the last red took place. O'Sullivan eventually potted the last red and then cleared the table up to the blue to progress to the final. After the game, Selby accused O'Sullivan of being \"disrespectful\" after O'Sullivan had played several hit-and-hope shots while snookered. He responded by saying \"if I was as good as Mark at escaping from snookers, I could maybe get it safe\".\nIn the final against Kyren Wilson, O'Sullivan won the first session 6–2 before Wilson came back to trail 10–8. O'Sullivan then won the last eight frames of the match to claim his sixth World Championship title and his 20th title in the Triple Crown Series. It was also the 37th ranking title of his career, putting him ahead of Stephen Hendry (36) on the all-time list. He won £500,000, doubling his previous biggest winner's cheque and went up to second in the ranking list, having been sixth before the World Championship. At the age of 44 years and 254 days, he became the oldest player to win a world title since Ray Reardon in 1978.\n2020–21 season.\nMost of this season was played without fans due to covid restrictions, O'Sullivan made 5 ranking tournament finals but lost all of them (Northern Ireland Open, Scottish Open, Welsh Open, Players Championship &amp; Tour Championship). He admitted in an interview he only put the effort into half of the finals due to lack of interest with the season being played without crowds. This season also saw him use live matches as practise, where he would play on to pot every last ball even in dead frames. He lost his world title defence in the 2nd round in a decider against Anthony McGill, trailing 10-6 going into the last session. This is the first season since 2010-11 where he didn't win any triple crown events.\n2021–22 season: Equalling Stephen Hendry's record of World Championship wins.\nAt the 2022 World Championship, O'Sullivan made his 30th Crucible appearance, equalling Steve Davis' record. He defeated Judd Trump 18–13 in the final to win his seventh world title — also his 39th ranking title and 21st Triple Crown title — to tie Hendry for the most world titles in the modern era. Aged 46 years and 148 days, O'Sullivan became the oldest world champion in the sport's history, surpassing Reardon, who had held the record since 1978.\n2022–23 season: Invitational success and breaking Steve Davis's record for most Crucible appearances.\nIn October 2022, O'Sullivan won the invitational 2022 Hong Kong Masters, defeating Marco Fu 6–4 in a final that was played before 9,000 spectators, a record live audience at a snooker match. At the following month's invitational 2022 Champion of Champions, he won the tournament for the fourth time, beating Trump 10–6 in the final. However, he reached only two ranking quarter-finals prior to the World Championship, both of which ended in whitewash defeats; he lost 0–6 to Ding in the 2022 UK Championship quarter-finals, the first time he had been whitewashed in any Triple Crown event, and lost 0–5 to Tian Pengfei in the 2023 Welsh Open quarter-finals. He did not place highly enough on the one-year ranking list to qualify for the 2023 Players Championship or the 2023 Tour Championship.\nAt the 2023 World Snooker Championship, O'Sullivan made a record 31st Crucible appearance, breaking Steve Davis's previous record of 30 appearances. In his second-round match against Hossein Vafaei, he made both his 200th century break at the Crucible and his 1,200th century break in professional competition. He reached the World Championship quarter-finals for a record-extending 21st time, also becoming the first player to compete in 100 matches at the Crucible, but lost 10–13 to eventual champion Brecel. However, he ended the season as world number one.\n2023–24 season: A fourth consecutive Shanghai Masters title, record-extending eighth UK Championship and Masters titles, and the World Grand Prix.\nThe 2023-24 snooker season marked a return to China for the first time since 2019, mainly due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ronnie O'Sullivan was the defending Shanghai Masters champion and had not lost a match in this event since his defeat to Michael Holt in the 2016 tournament. O'Sullivan's rich run of form in this event continued, as he defeated reigning World Champion Luca Brecel 11-9 in the final to record his 18th consecutive Shanghai Masters match win, as well as his fourth consecutive Shanghai Masters title and fifth title in this event overall.\nThe 2023 UK Championship marked the 30th anniversary of Ronnie O'Sullivan's first ranking title and first Triple Crown title at the 1993 UK Championship, where he broke Stephen Hendry's record as the youngest player to win a ranking title at the age of 17 years and 358 days, a record that he still holds. Thirty years later, O'Sullivan reached his 9th UK Championship final and his 30th Triple Crown final overall, where he faced three-time UK Champion Ding Junhui. O'Sullivan emerged as a 10-7 victor to achieve a record-extending eighth UK Championship title and 22nd Triple Crown title, making him the oldest player in history to win this event, at the age of 47 years and 363 days.\nO'Sullivan defeated Ali Carter 10-7 in the final of the 2024 Masters, making it a record-extending eighth Masters; a title he last held in 2017. He won his first Masters at the age of 19 years and 69 days in 1995 and his latest at 48 years and 39 days. Making him both the youngest and oldest winner of the Masters.\nOne week after winning the Masters, Ronnie beat Judd Trump 10-7 to win the World Grand Prix final for his third time."

        "title": "1971 Women's World Cup",
        "text": " \nThe 1971 Women's World Cup (Spanish: 1971 Campeonato de Fútbol Femenil) was an association football tournament for women's national teams organised by the Federation of Independent European Female Football (FIEFF) in Mexico in August–September 1971. Held in Mexico City and Guadalajara, it is the second known tournament to be named as a women's football World Cup after the 1970 edition in Italy and the first time in the same place after the men's 1970 FIFA World Cup tournament in the previous year. It was held twenty years before the first official FIFA women's world cup.\nThe tournament featured six national teams from Latin America and Europe, including hosts Mexico which qualified automatically. Denmark were the tournament champions, defending its title by winning the final 3–0 against Mexico, in front of a 110,000 crowd.\nBackground.\nA women's football international match was played in Scotland in 1881. Later instances included games between British, French and Belgian teams in the 1920s, and a women's European Championship in 1957. During this time, women's football was often stifled or banned by male-dominated football federations in many countries. In Brazil, women's football was effectively illegal from 1941 until 1979.\nFIEFF organised a previous Women's World Cup in Italy in 1970, also won by Denmark.\nQualifying.\nThe 1971 tournament featured five different qualifying groups, four in Europe and one in the Americas, where Argentina was the only team included in the initial draw. Italy qualified for the main tournament against England and Austria, but England was later given a place in the finals after all teams from one of the European groups (Spain, Switzerland and West Germany) withdrew from the tournament.\nSimilarly, France qualified by defeating the Netherlands after the withdrawal of Czechoslovakia, and Denmark qualified by default after both Belgium and Sweden withdrew. The Americas round was not played and Argentina qualified by default, as neither potential opponents, Chile and Costa Rica, fulfilled the necessary requirements for the matches to be played.\nSome of the qualifiers and finals games were officially recognised – for example, the Italian Football Federation classes all of the 1971 Italy games as full internationals. The match between France and the Netherlands on April 1971 was the first FIFA-recognised women's international match: it was played in Hazebrouck in front of 1,500 spectators. However, players from both teams were unaware of the nature of the match; the French players did not know they had qualified for the tournament until their coach told them after the game, and the Dutch team thought they were playing a friendly match against Stade de Reims (which provided most of the French players) to prepare for the official match in May. A protest was filled by the Dutch organization in charge of the team, to no avail.\nTournament.\nTournament sponsors Martini &amp; Rossi paid for each team's travel, accommodation, and kits. Goalposts were painted in pink hoops and stadium staff wore pink clothes, in order to try to appeal to women and families. Ticket prices ranged from 30 pesos (£1.15) to 80 pesos (£3). The tournament mascot was Xochitl, \"a young girl in [a] football kit\".\nThe opening match of the finals, Mexico–Argentina (15 August) had a reported attendance of 100,000 at the Azteca Stadium. An estimated 80,000 people attended the Mexico–England group game. The World Cup final, Mexico–Denmark, had an estimated attendance of 110,000, a world record for women's sport. This figure was reported both at the time and subsequently, and surviving footage supports the estimates. The football record at the Azteca Stadium was three years earlier, 119,853 at the men's Mexico–Brazil match in July 1968.\nThe hosts Mexico qualified for the final after defeating Italy in the semifinals. Two days before the final, the Mexican press noted the players for Mexico were unhappy they had not been receiving economic support for participating in the tournament. The Mexican team threatened to skip the final but gave up their two million peso demand and the game went forward as scheduled.\nDenmark won the tournament after beating Mexico 3–0 in the final, featuring a hat trick by 15-year-old Susanne Augustesen. The victorious Danish team were treated to a celebratory reception at Copenhagen Town Hall upon their return from the tournament. However, due to the unofficial nature of the tournament, it is not recognised by the Danish Football Association.\nSquads.\nEngland's team included 13-year-old Leah Caleb, 14-year-old Gill Sayell, and 15-year-old Chris Lockwood; their captain was 19-year-old Carol Wilson and they were accompanied by referee Pat Dunn as a chaperone and trainer. 15-year-old Susanne Augustesen scored a hat-trick for Denmark as they beat Mexico 3–0 in the final. Augustesen was honoured by the mayor of her hometown, Holbæk.\n12 members of England's 14-woman squad reunited in June 2019 for the first time since the tournament.\nKnockout stage.\nFifth place play-off.\nA match for fifth place was played between the two teams which did not advance to the semifinals.\nLater tournaments.\nThe tournament was later followed by the series of Mundialito tournaments throughout the 1980s, mostly held in Italy, and FIFA's Women's Invitation Tournament in China in 1988 before the first FIFA Women's World Cup in China in 1991.\nAftermath.\nIn 2023, several documentaries were released about the 1971 event:\nIn Mexico, \"Tan cerca de las nubes\", directed by Manuel Cañibe, on that country's squad that participated in the 1970 cup in Italy, as well as the 1971 one.\nIn Argentina, \"México 71\", directed by Carolina Gil Solari and Carolina M. Fernández, on the Argentian squad's experiences during the cup.\nIn the UK, \"Copa 71\", directed by Rachel Ramsay and James Erskine."

In the following two years, Western Suburbs played against St George again in the grand final losing on both occasions with Hayes featuring in those matches. The 1963 grand final is remembered for the wet and muddy conditions the players competed in and for the photograph of Norm Provan and Arthur Summons embracing at full time which later became an enduring image of rugby league.

The tournament returned to its usual two-year cycle after the previous event in Eugene, Oregon, United States was postponed to 2022, held a little 13 months earlier due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThese are the first World Athletics Championships in Hungary. The city of Budapest had previously stated an interest in hosting the 2007 World Championships, but withdrew and it was eventually held in Osaka. The official mascot of the event is a Racka, called Youhuu.\nVenue.\nThe championships were held in the National Athletics Centre in Budapest, which was specially built for this event, and has a provisional capacity of 36,000.\nEntry standards.\nWorld Athletics announced that athletes would qualify by their World Athletics Rankings position, wild card (reigning world champion or 2022 Diamond League winner) or by achieving the entry standard.\nTo qualify as a Wild Card required fulfilling one of the following conditions:\nCountries who had no male and/or no female athletes who had achieved the Entry Standard or considered as having achieved the entry standard or a qualified relay team, could enter one unqualified male athlete OR one unqualified female athlete in one event of the championships (except the road events and field events, combined events, 10,000 m and 3000 m steeplechase).\nSince the postponement of the 2023 World Relays to 2024 Nassau, for Covid-pandemic reasons, a modified qualification system has been available for relay teams.\nTarget numbers.\nAt the end of the qualification period, the 2023 World Athletics Rankings were published. They were used to invite additional athletes to the World Championships where the target number of athletes had not been achieved for that event through other methods of qualification.\nThe maximum of three athletes per country in individual events was not affected by this rule. Member federations retained the right to confirm or reject athlete selections through this method.\nWhere the highest ranked athletes were from a country that already had three entrants for the event, or where member federations had rejected an entrant, the next highest ranked athlete became eligible for entry via the world rankings.\nMedia coverage.\nIn the United States, television rights to the championships belong to NBC Sports.\nEurovision Sport and ESPN jointly hold and distribute World Athletics media rights in Europe and Africa for 2023. Warner Bros. Discovery has agreed with World Athletics rights-holders Eurovision Sport and ESPN to broadcast the nine-day event on its channels – Eurosport 1, Eurosport 2 and Eurosport App – including its platform Discovery+ on a non-exclusive basis in more than 45 countries across Europe, excluding the Nordics region – Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden. Streaming is available on Discovery+ in Austria, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, UK and Ireland.\nIn India, live streaming is available on JioCinema."

        "title": "Auckland Tuatara (basketball)",
        "text": "The Auckland Tuatara are a New Zealand basketball team based in Auckland. The Tuatara compete in the National Basketball League (NBL) and play their home games at Eventfinda Stadium. Founded in Tasmania in 2019 as the Southern Huskies, the team relocated to Auckland in 2020 and for two years were known as the Auckland Huskies. In December 2021, the team was purchased by the owners of the Auckland Tuatara baseball team.\nHistory.\nIn Tasmania.\nIn 2016, sights were set on an Australian NBL franchise returning to Tasmania. The Hobart Chargers of the South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL) wanted to be \"NBL ready\" in three years. In 2018, plans to get the Chargers into the Australian NBL morphed into an overarching Tasmanian bid for a proposed new franchise to be called Southern Huskies led by former Hobart Devils player, Justin Hickey. The Huskies bid ultimately fell through when Hickey failed to acquire the Derwent Entertainment Centre (DEC), compounded with the league believing there were several hurdles and shortcomings with the bid. The licence subsequently went to the South East Melbourne Phoenix for the 2019–20 season and later the Tasmania JackJumpers were accepted into the Australian NBL for the 2021–22 season.\nIn November 2018, reports began to surface that the Southern Huskies would be entering the New Zealand NBL in 2019, with the Huskies viewing the New Zealand league as a launch pad to the Australian NBL and the stronger competition more appealing than the various Australian state leagues. The inclusion, while an exciting one for the New Zealand league, did present a number of unprecedented challenges for the competition, with flights to Tasmania problematic for New Zealand's less financially well-off franchises, while double or triple-headers on New Zealand trips for the Huskies were a looming issue. Despite these concerns, the move had the support of the existing eight NZNBL franchises. On 5 December 2018, a five-year contract was signed between the New Zealand NBL and the Southern Huskies, marking the first time in New Zealand sporting history that an overseas team had joined a New Zealand owned league.\nThe 2019 season saw each New Zealand team visit Tasmania to play the Huskies at least once, while the Huskies played every New Zealand team in New Zealand as well, playing double-headers each time. As part of the agreement, the Huskies assisted with the cost for New Zealand teams to travel to Tasmania to play, with the NZNBL Board not wanting to increase the New Zealand teams' expenses through this move. The Huskies' nine home games in 2019 were split between the Derwent Entertainment Centre in Hobart and the Silverdome in Launceston. Coached by former Australian NBL player Anthony Stewart, the inaugural squad included imports Jalen Billups and Tre Nichols alongside Harry Froling, Marcel Jones, Craig Moller and Jordan Vandenberg. The Huskies concluded their first season in the NZNBL missing the post-season with a fifth-place finish and a 9–9 record.\nOn 27 June 2019, the Huskies announced that they would rebrand as the Tasmanian Huskies for the 2020 season in order to remove any stigma of a division within the state. This announcement came days after it was revealed that any new team from the state in the Australian NBL must be branded Tasmanian. However, on 9 August 2019, the Huskies withdrew from the New Zealand NBL after they claimed their relationship with Basketball Tasmania became untenable, with mounting debts also cited as a factor for disbanding.\nNBL1.\nOn 17 December 2018, following the Hobart Chargers' decision to not enter the new NBL1 competition, the Southern Huskies entered the Hobart Huskies into the inaugural 2019 NBL1 season with both men's and women's teams. The Hobart Huskies were abolished after one season following the demise of the Southern Huskies.\nIn Auckland.\nIn May 2020, the Southern Huskies re-emerged and relocated permanently to Auckland, New Zealand, and became the Auckland Huskies. They subsequently entered the 2020 New Zealand NBL season, a competition that was revised and modified due the COVID-19 pandemic. Coached by former Australian and New Zealand NBL player Kevin Braswell, the 2020 squad featured Leon Henry, Izayah Le'afa and Tohi Smith-Milner. The Huskies' 2020 campaign saw them lose in the second elimination final after finishing third with an 8–6 record.\nFor the 2021 New Zealand NBL season, the Huskies played at Eventfinda Stadium. The 2021 squad featured Justin Bibbs, Chris Johnson, Jeremy Kendle and Tom Vodanovich.\nIn December 2021, the owners of the Auckland Tuatara baseball team purchased the NZNBL licence from the Huskies owners and re-named the team the Auckland Tuatara. Behind the likes of Chris Johnson, Robert Loe and Dontae Russo-Nance, the Tuatara finished fifth in the 2022 regular season with a 10–8 record and went on to reach the NBL final for the first time in franchise history. In the final, they lost 81–73 to the Otago Nuggets.\nIn 2023, the squad was highlighted by Australian imports Cameron Gliddon and Jarrad Weeks alongside Robert Loe and Reuben Te Rangi. The Tuatara finished the regular season with a league-best 13–5 record behind Loe's MVP season. They went on to reach their second straight NBL final, where they lost 93–82 to the Canterbury Rams.\nCurrent roster.\n&lt;section begin=roster /&gt;\n&lt;section end=roster /&gt;"

He played college football at South Florida.\nEarly life and high school.\nLove was born and raised in Clearwater, Florida and attended Countryside High School. Love was a standout defensive end for the Cougars and was rated a three-star prospect by several recruiting services, but lost interest from many high-profile programs due to academic struggles. He ultimately committed to play college football for the nearby University of South Florida (USF) over offers from Arizona, Indiana, Iowa State, Louisville, Mississippi State, North Carolina State, and West Virginia, among others.\nCollege career.\nLove spent five years at South Florida, redshirting his freshman year after suffering a knee injury early in the season. After missing most of his redshirt freshman season due to injury, Love became a regular starter for the Bulls during his redshirt junior season, registering 27 tackles and three sacks. In his final season, Love set career highs with 28 tackles, 10.5 tackles for loss, five sacks, and three passes defended. He finished his collegiate career with 64 tackles, 18.5 for a loss, and 8.5 sacks with one forced fumble in 32 games.

        "text": "The 2016–17 Denver Pioneers men's ice hockey team represented University of Denver in intercollegiate college ice hockey during the 2016–17 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season. The head coach was Jim Montgomery and the team captain was Will Butcher. The team won the 2017 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament. The team's leading scorer was Troy Terry.\nSeason.\nDenver entered its fourth year under Jim Montgomery looking to continue several trends. The Pioneers had increased their wins and winning percentage over each of the previous two seasons and had yet to miss appearing in the NCAA tournament with Montgomery behind the bench. After a semifinal finish in the 2016 championship DU was projected to be a contender for the 2017 title and was ranked 3rd in the preseason. Denver opened their season as the host for the Ice Breaker Tournament and fell flat on their face, losing both games and finishing last in the four-team tournament.\nAfter that inauspicious beginning the Pioneers collected themselves and played host to #2 Boston University, winning both games. Denver finished out the month with four more wins against weaker teams and moved all the way up to #2 in the nation before their big series in North Dakota against the Fighting Hawks. The Pioneers battled the defending national champions to a 1–1 draw in the first game before losing in the 3–on–3 overtime session (which only gave UND a single point in the NCHC standings) then won a 3–2 defensive struggle in the second game. For their efforts Denver rose to #1 in the country but after tying the lowly Miami RedHawks twice they slipped below conference rival Minnesota–Duluth. Denver held the #2 ranking through a pair of wins against long-time rival Colorado College before meeting UMD for their final weekend before the winter break. In the first game Denver rode a tremendous second period to a 4–3 win but could only manage a single goal in the rematch and lost 1–3, leaving the top two teams ranked exactly where they were before the series.\nThe Pioneers did not play in a holiday tournament but instead went to Rhode Island for a series against the 2015 champion Providence Friars. Denver got more than it could handle from the Friars, getting a bloody nose from their unranked opponent. The Pioneers returned home for a weekend before hitting the road for two consecutive weeks, splitting both series before returning to Colorado to face #18 Omaha. Despite some of their recent struggles Denver was still ranked #3 in the country and showed just how goo they could be by winning every remaining game on their schedule. DU entered its final weekend with the NCHC championship already won and after sweeping Omaha on the road they had the #1 ranking sewn up as well as the best record in the nation.\nDenver opened the NCHC Tournament at home against 8-win Colorado College and easily handles the Tigers, winning the two matches by a total score of 8–1 and outshooting their in-state rival 77–39. The Pioneers headed to Minnesota for the semifinal and played North Dakota in front of partisan Fighting Hawk crowd. Despite several close calls Denver was unable to score on UND and the Hawks lone goal served as the game-winner. While the highly anticipated rematch against Minnesota–Duluth never happened, Denver did redeem themselves the next night with a 3–1 win over #8 Western Michigan. Even with their slip up in the semifinal, Denver retained the #1 ranking and went to Cincinnati as the #1 overall seed.\nThe pioneers opened the 2017 Tournament against WCHA champion Michigan Tech and dominated the Huskies, scoring the first five goals of the game and riding the outburst to a relatively easy 5–2 win. In the Midwest Final Denver met Penn State who, despite being in their first tournament, had won their opening game 10–3. Denver again got an early start, going up 2–0 before the Lions tied the game early in the second period. The DU offense roared a second time in the middle frame with three more goals while Troy Terry finished off his hat trick with an empty net goal in the third.\nIn the Frozen Four semifinal in Chicago, Denver opened against a surprising Notre Dame squad who were looking for their third consecutive upset but the buzzsaw that was the DU offense cut down the Fighting Irish with the first five goals of the game. Notre Dame was only able to manage 16 shots in the contest and scored a power play goal on their only opportunity of the night. The Pioneers made the championship game and were finally able to play the rubber match against Minnesota–Duluth in front of 19,783 fans. The two teams fought a close first period but neither could manage to score. just under five minutes into the second Jarid Lukosevicius opened the scoring with his 14th of the season and added a second goal 16 seconds later. Duluth cut the lead in half with an Alex Iafallo power play marker a short while later but Lukosevicius completed his hat trick before the end of the period and Denver took a 3–1 lead into the final frame. The Pioneers weathered a furious onslaught by the Bulldogs, with Tanner Jaillet facing 17 shots in the third. Riley Tufte cut the lead to one with just over five minutes remaining but UMD was unable to even the score and Denver skated to its 8th national title. Lukosevicius' hat trick was the first in a title game since 1993 scored by his coach, Jim Montgomery.\nJust before the championship game, team captain Will Butcher was announced as the winner of the 2017 Hobey Baker Award joining a slew of other awards by Denver players including the Mike Richter Award (Tanner Jaillet), NCHC Player of the Year (Butcher), NCHC Rookie of the Year (Henrik Borgström), NCHC Goaltender of the Year (Jaillet), NCHC Offensive Defenseman of the Year (Butcher) and the NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player Jarid Lukosevicius. Additionally Butcher was named to the All-American First Team while Jaillet made the second team. Both players made the NCHC First Team, Henrik Borgström and Dylan Gambrell each made the conference Second Team while Borgström and Michael Davies both made the All-NCHC Rookie Team.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | "

        "text": "Joshua Brown (born January 21, 1994) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman for the Utah NHL team of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected in the sixth round, 152nd overall, by the Florida Panthers in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. Prior to joining Utah, Brown played for the Ottawa Senators, Boston Bruins, Florida Panthers, and the Arizona Coyotes.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nBrown played as a youth locally in his hometown of London, Ontario at the midget level with the London Jr. Knights before he was selected by the Oshawa Generals of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) in the third round, 44th overall in the 2010 OHL Priority Selection.\nAs a 16 year old in 2010–11, he played in the Ontario Junior Hockey League with the Whitby Fury. He began his four-year major junior career with the Generals in the OHL in 2011–12. Using his large frame as a physical, defensive defenceman, Brown remained with the Generals throughout his junior career, captaining the club for two seasons and capturing the Memorial Cup in his final junior season in 2014–15.\nProfessional.\nSelected by the Panthers in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft in the sixth round, 152nd overall, Brown was later signed to a three-year, entry-level contract with Florida on April 10, 2015. In his first professional season, Brown split the 2015–16 season, between the Panthers American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Portland Pirates, and the Manchester Monarchs of the ECHL. He appeared in 54 games with the Monarchs, totaling 12 points, and appearing in a first-round playoff series.\nIn his first full campaign in the AHL, Brown spent the 2016–17 season with the Panthers' new affiliate, the Springfield Thunderbirds. In the Thunderbirds' inaugural season, he notched a career best 3 goals and 13 points from the blueline in 72 games. He followed that up the next season with one goal and ten points in 66 games with Springfield.\nAs an impending restricted free agent, Brown agreed to a two-year, two-way contract extension to remain within the Panthers organization on May 31, 2018. In the 2018–19 season, Brown returned to the Thunderbirds for his third year with the club. After adding three goals in 19 games, Brown received his first call-up to the NHL by the Panthers on January 18, 2019. Recalled due to an injury to fellow defenceman, MacKenzie Weegar, and with the Panthers needing a physical presence, Brown made his NHL debut in a 3–1 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs at BB&amp;T Center in Sunrise, Florida, on January 19.\nIn his first full season with the Panthers in 2019–20, Brown appeared in a career high 56 games posting three goals and 8 points. In need of a new contract Brown was traded in the following off-season by the Panthers to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for a 2020 fourth-round draft pick on October 2, 2020. As a restricted free agent, Brown was then signed a two-year, $2.4 million contract with the Senators on October 5. During the 2021–22 season, Brown was placed in COVID-19 protocol on November 10, 2021, and returned on November 20. On November 26, Brown suffered an upper-body injury that kept him out of the lineup until January 13, 2022.\nOn March 21, 2022, Brown was traded by the Senators, along with a 2022 conditional seventh-round selection, to the Boston Bruins in exchange for Zachary Senyshyn and a 2022 fifth-round draft pick. He finished the 2021–22 season with a combined six points in 52 games played with the Senators and Bruins.\nOn July 13, 2022, having left the Bruins as a free agent, Brown was signed to a two-year, $2.55 million contract with the Arizona Coyotes."

        "text": "William Randall Davis Jr. (born May 29, 1984) is an American college baseball coach and former catcher. Davis is the head coach of the Lamar Cardinals baseball team. Davis is the son of former college baseball coach Randy Davis who was an assistant coach at UL-Monroe, LSU, and South Carolina and the head coach at Louisiana Tech. The elder Davis died in February 2022. Will Davis is married to the former Danielle Hall of Bogalusa, Louisiana. She is a former cheerleader for the New Orleans Saints. The couple have three children Everly (2016), Coco (2020), and Crash (2022).\nPlaying career.\nDavis attended Robert E. Lee High School (now Liberty Magnet High School) in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Davis played for the school's varsity baseball team. Davis then enrolled at Louisiana State University, to play college baseball for the LSU Tigers baseball team.\nDavis was a letterman on the 2004 College World Series team and a two-time SEC Academic Honor Roll selection.\nCoaching career.\nDavis began his coaching career in 2008 as the coordinator of baseball operations at LSU. In 2009, Davis was promoted to assistant coach. The Tigers won the 2009 College World Series. Davis quickly developed a reputation as a strong on-field coach and aggressive recruiter, particularly in his home state of Louisiana.\nOn January 15, 2016, Davis was the head coach in waiting of the Lamar Cardinals baseball program. In 2016 Davis spent the season at Lamar while serving as head coach in waiting and at times the acting head coach. The Cardinals went 35-19 defeating national powers Texas, Arizona, and LSU.\nDavis was tasked with re-stocking a roster that had missed the 2015 and 2016 recruiting classes due to the retirement announcement and subsequent retirement of long-time Cardinals coach Jim Gilligan. With 13 seniors remaining from Gilligan's last year but no other classes in the program Davis was able to sign future MLB draft picks Carson Lance and Tanner Driskill late and put together a 33-25 season in his first campaign as head coach.\nWith the 13-man senior class leaving, Davis methodically built the program back up by bringing in nationally ranked recruiting classes for the first time in school history. The 2017 class was ranked #73 in the nation by \"Perfect Game\" (#1 in the Southland Conference while the 2018 class was ranked #92 nationally and #2 in the Southland. As the young players began to develop, Davis switched his recruiting approach to supplementing the program with older junior college players and received national rankings by the JUCO Baseball Blog of #22 in 2020 and #7 in 2021.\nIn 2021 the rebuild was complete with the Cardinals having a winning season and reaching the postseason for the first time since 2017.\nThe 2022 Lamar Cardinals enjoyed their best season in roughly a decade going 37-21 with a 20-10 record in the WAC good enough for a 2nd place finish. The Cardinals enjoyed wins over perennial powers Rice (twice), Houston, and eventual national runner-up Oklahoma.\nDavis followed up 2022 with another successful season in 2023 going 32-23 and finishing in 3rd place in the Southland Conference. The Cardinals defeated Kansas State, Houston, Baylor, #5 Texas A&amp;M, and eventual national semifinalist TCU. Lamar Catcher Ryan Snell was named Southland Conference Player of the Year and a Buster Posey Award Finalist.\nCoaching Catchers.\nDavis has developed a reputation as one of the premier catching coaches in the nation. Four of his catchers at LSU were drafted: Kade Scivicque (4th Round), Tyler Moore (5th Round) Michael Papierski (9th Round), and Chris Chinea (17th Round) while three more at Lamar have played professional baseball: Bryndan Arredondo (22nd Round), Anthony Quirion (free agent sign), and Ryan Snell (7th Round). \nMichael Papierski has since made it to the Major Leagues while Scivicque and Ryan Snell were both named All-Americans and Buster Posey (formerly Johnny Bench) Award Finalists."
