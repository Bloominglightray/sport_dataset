        "title": "2020–21 Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2020–21 Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball team represented the University of Arkansas during the 2020–21 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team was led by second-year head coach Eric Musselman and played its home games at Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville, Arkansas, as a member of the Southeastern Conference. The Razorbacks finished second in the SEC regular season and earned a 3 seed in the NCAA Tournament's South Regional. Arkansas went on to make it to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Tournament for the first time since the 1995–96 season, and then to the Elite Eight for the first time since the 1994–95 season. Freshman guard Moses Moody was named the SEC Freshman of the Year, 1st Team All-SEC, Freshman All-American, and AP Honorable Mention All-American. The Razorbacks finished the season with an overall record of 25–7, 13–4 in SEC play, and finished ranked #6 in the Coaches Poll and #10 in the AP Poll. Arkansas's season ended when they lost to eventual national champion Baylor in the Elite Eight.\nThe Razorbacks cruised through a pandemic-shortened non-conference slate that originally featured a neutral site matchup against Oklahoma in Tulsa, Oklahoma and a bid to the MGM Resorts Main Event tournament in Las Vegas, Nevada. The non-conference schedule included a game against an in-state program, the University of Central Arkansas, for the first time since a match against Arkansas State in the 1987 NIT and the first time in the regular season since playing Arkansas Tech in 1950. The Razorbacks also defeated their eventual Sweet Sixteen opponent, Oral Roberts, in a non-conference game in Bud Walton Arena. Owning an 8–0 record heading into conference play, Arkansas started its SEC regular season with a road win against Auburn, but lost starter Justin Smith to an ankle injury that sidelined or limited him for the first third of conference play, which contributed to Arkansas getting off to a rough 2–4 start against SEC competition, including consecutive blowout losses on the road to LSU and Alabama.\nAfter the losses to LSU and Alabama, which were sandwiched around the toughest practice of the Musselman era, the Razorbacks turned their season around and did not lose another regular season SEC game, winning eleven straight conference matchups and eleven out of their last twelve overall in the regular season, with the lone loss coming on the road against Oklahoma State. The conference winning streak included three wins against teams that beat the Razorbacks earlier in the season, two top-ten wins, and the Razorbacks' first top-ten road win since 2006. Arkansas became ranked for the first time since 2018 on February 15, 2021. The Razorbacks followed that up by being ranked in consecutive polls for the first time since 2015, then hosted their first ranked matchup in Fayetteville since 1998 when #6 Alabama came to town with a chance to clinch the SEC regular season championship before losing to Arkansas 81–66.\nAfter winning every game in the month of February, the Razorbacks were ranked #12 before closing out the regular season in second place for the SEC title with a 13–4 conference record, their highest finish in league play since the 2014–15 season and as high as they had finished since winning the conference and national titles in 1994. Arkansas entered the 2021 SEC men's basketball tournament ranked #8, the team's highest ranking since the 1994–95 season. After beating Missouri in the quarterfinals and losing to LSU in the semifinals, the Razorbacks earned a 3 seed for the NCAA tournament, their highest seed since the 1994–95 season.\nArkansas advanced to the Elite Eight after victories against Colgate, Texas Tech, and Oral Roberts. Arkansas had not made a Sweet Sixteen appearance since 1996 and had not made it to the Elite Eight since 1995. The Hogs lost to eventual national champion Baylor in the Elite Eight. The Razorbacks finished the season ranked #10 in the AP Poll and #6 in the Coaches Poll; it was their first top-ten finish since 1995.\nSenior guard Jalen Tate was named to the All-South Region team after his performance in the NCAA Tournament. Freshman guard Moses Moody was voted AP Honorable Mention All-American, 1st Team All-SEC, SEC Freshman of the Year, and SEC All-Freshman. Junior guard JD Notae was named SEC Sixth Man of the Year.\nPrevious season.\nThe Razorbacks finished the 2019–20 season with a record of 20–12, 7–11 in SEC play to finish in a tie for 10th place. Junior Mason Jones won a share of the SEC Player of the Year award and was named a consensus First-Team All-SEC player.\nArkansas started the season strong, going into conference play with an 11–1 record, including two road wins against Power Five teams, Georgia Tech and Indiana.\nAfter winning their first-round game against Vanderbilt on March 11, 2020, the Hogs were slated for a rematch against South Carolina in the second round, but the SEC announced on March 12, 2020 that the SEC Tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with an announcement following from the NCAA later that day that the whole tournament was cancelled, along with all other winter and spring championships, ending the Razorbacks' season.\nThey finished with 20 wins against 12 losses in coach Eric Musselman's first season. He was the first coach to win 20 games in his initial campaign at Arkansas since John Pelphrey won 23 in the 2007–08 season.\nOffseason.\nOn August 1, 2020, star guard Isaiah Joe announced that he was withdrawing his name from the 2020 NBA draft and returning for his junior season. Joe was a member of the 2019 SEC All-Freshman Team and earned preseason All-SEC recognition prior to his sophomore season, before going on to lead the league in three-pointers made, rank fourth in the NCAA for three-pointers made per game, as well as being named SEC Player of the Week on December 30, 2019 before having knee surgery on February 4, 2020, which sidelined him for six games. Joe would have highlighted a group of three returnees with starting experience for the Hogs, but on August 17, 2020, sixteen days after his initial announcement, Joe reversed his decision and opted to declare for the 2020 NBA draft.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=|Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| SEC Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=| NCAA Tournament"

        "title": "Dublin Blues Rugby League",
        "text": "The Dublin Blues were an Irish rugby league team from Dublin, Ireland. \nHistory.\nThe Dublin Blues were Ireland's first ever rugby league club having been founded in 1989 by Brian Corrigan following a meeting with a delegation from the Rugby Football League which took place in 1988.\nInitially the club played touring teams from the United Kingdom as there were no other teams in Ireland for a number of years. However, in 1995 the RFL financed a development programme in Ireland which would lead to the first domestic competition in 1997.\nThe Blues would become the inaugural champions of Ireland beating Tallaght Tigers in the 1997 Grand Final. They would go on to compete in the next two grand finals winning one and losing one.\nFollowing their win in 1997 the Blues would become the first ever Irish team to enter into the Challenge Cup where they would be drawn away to Dewsbury Moors and would find themselves at the wrong end of a 32–7 score line.\nAnother foray into the Challenge Cup followed in 1999 this time the Blues would again come undone in the first round against Farnworth.\nThe Blues were a dominant force in the late 90's and early 00's in Irish rugby league in total they took part in 6 All Ireland Grand Finals winning 3 and also an Al Ireland Challenge Cup Final in 1998.\nWhile the early 2000s bore fruit for Ireland's oldest team the Blues became weakened towards the end of the decade and in 2008 ceased to exist.\nIt seemed the once powerhouse of Irish Rugby League who produced Wigan Warriors legend Brian Carney would be resigned to the history books. However, 10 years after they ceased playing a plan was hatched to bring back the Blues.\nThe initial plan was to seek the funding to enter RFL League 1 and to give Irish players an opportunity to play semi-professional rugby league without the necessity to relocate to another country.\nIn 2020 the launch of the Euro XIII competition caught the working groups eyes and they successfully enter to participate in the 2021 competition.\n However this competition never took off and Dublin blues remains a memory.

        "text": "The 1928–29 Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey season was the 31st season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nBefore the season began a major change had to be undertaken; the Boston Madison Square Garden, the new indoor facility for the Boston Bruins, was going to serve as the new home for Harvard hockey, but due to a lack of ice, the team would have to travel south to use the New York Madison Square Garden for practices. Tex Rickard controlled both buildings and he was willing to let Harvard have access to either. There was also a change of university policy for the team as it was now able to play more than two away games per season.\nThe team opened their season with a pair of solid wins and then lost their two-game series against Toronto. Despite the loss, Harvard had pushed the Blues into overtime in both games and looked to be as strong as they were the year before. The second game only ended in a scoreless tie due to Toronto's captain throwing his stick to knock the puck off of a Crimson stick (not a penalty at the time). Harvard's championship hopes were dealt a serious blow when they lost the first game of their collegiate season on Dartmouth's new rink and then had to wait over a month before their next game.\nThe Crimson were able to exact some revenge in the rematch against the Indians but they had little margin for error after an easy tilt against Pennsylvania. They entered the series against Yale with their foes having gone undefeated to that point (13–0–1) but Harvard could still spoil the Eli's season. In front of 12,000 spectators at the Garden, Harvard ground out a 2–1 overtime win in a penalty-filled game. The rematch came a week later and once again the home team won, unfortunately that team was Yale. Harvard was held scoreless throughout the game but the defense remained stout and only surrendered a single goal in the third period. The final game, which would decide whether or not Yale could claim a championship, was played at Yale on 13 March and the two teams proved to be the equal of the other once more. While Yale appeared to be the better team at times during the game they would not distance themselves from the Crimson and the two teams finished regulation tied at 2-all. Overtime was needed but after a scoreless 10-minutes another was required. Neither team was able to end the game by the 80th minute so a third extra session was yet required. With both teams visible exhausted Frank Nelson was finally able to score the deciding goal, he just happened to be wearing an Eli sweater.\nWhile Harvard finished with a less-than-satisfying result and their record was rather poor, the Crimson had played tremendously well through most of the year, they just couldn't get luck to side in their favor in 1929.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Ramblers represent Loyola University Chicago in the NCAA Division I Atlantic 10 Conference.\nLoyola began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1913. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Loyola's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "The 2020 Go Bowling 235 was a NASCAR Cup Series raced on August 16, 2020, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. Contested over 65 laps on the road course, it was the 23rd race of the 2020 NASCAR Cup Series season, which was a replacement race for the Watkins Glen round because of government restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe race had three stages: the first two stages at 15 laps each, and 35 for the final.\nOn July 30, it was revealed after simulation testing revealed concerns of high speeds entering turn 1 (a turn already considered to be difficult among road racers), a temporary chicane was added in between the 4th turn of the oval and the entrance to pit road (similar to the Charlotte ROVAL). NASCAR further announced that it would use the high-downforce aero package used for the road course races in 2019 (in 2020, road courses were scheduled to use a low-downforce package similar to what was used in 2018 and what is used on ovals 1-mile or shorter in 2020). The addition of the chicane increased the length of the course from 3.56 to 3.61 miles and added a 13th and 14th turn to the original 12-turn layout.\nQualifying.\nKevin Harvick was awarded the pole for the race as determined by a new formula that NASCAR officials announced on August 6. The formula will use three performance metrics, which will be weighted and averaged to determine the lineup and pit selection order. The metrics are Finishing position from the previous race (weighted 50%), Ranking in team owner points standings (35%), and Fastest lap from the previous race (15%). The success of this system led to NASCAR replacing the traditional rules for determining starting positions of owner points, then race winners, and then most qualifying attempts (with owner points as the tiebreaker) in the 2021 season if qualifying cannot be held because of inclement weather in the eight races where practice and qualifying cannot be conducted, and expanded in the 2022 season to determining practice and qualifying groups for all races.\nKaz Grala replaced Austin Dillon, who was medically disqualified by NASCAR after a positive virus test. NASCAR further restricted drivers from participation in more than one race during the weekend, which meant typical Xfinity drivers who would substitute would not be permitted to participate in the Cup race. NASCAR did allow an Xfinity Series driver who was still on premises to relieve for a Cup driver in Sunday's event who fell ill.\nRace.\nStage Results.\nStage One\n\"Laps:\" 15\nStage Two\n\"Laps:\" 15\nFinal Stage Results.\nStage Three\n\"Laps:\" 35\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nNBC Sports covered the race on the television side. Rick Allen, Jeff Burton, Steve Letarte and four-time Daytona winner Dale Earnhardt Jr. covered the race from the booth at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Dave Burns, Parker Kligerman and Dillon Welch handled the pit road duties on site, and Rutledge Wood handled the features from his home during the race.\nRadio.\nMRN had the radio call for the race, which was also simulcast on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio."

Despite the Terriers having the best record amongst eastern independents, the NCAA selection committee offered the 1958 NCAA Tournament bid to Harvard instead.\nAfter graduating, Dupuis joined the US national team and played for the team during the following season.

        "text": "The 1929–30 Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey season was the 32nd season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nPrior to the season, in order to settle the confusion caused by using professional referees in amateur games, a meeting was held at the Harvard Club so that colleges could agree on a uniform code of rules to be observed by all. The meeting specifically did not address the new offside rule that the NHL was implementing, though that probably was for the best as the NHL would have to alter its rule during the 1929–30 season to counteract the ballooning goal totals. In addition, Harvard began recording assists as an official statistic for this season.\nFor the first time in 6 years Harvard did not open its season against MIT, instead they returned to their former home to play Boston University. Despite the change in opponent, Harvard still won its inaugural game though both teams weren't particularly sharp in the contest. In their annual contests against Canadian colleges, Harvard fell to Toronto twice but then rebounded after shuffling their lineup against usual opponent MIT.\nOn January 8 Harvard played only the second game in the program's history against a western opponent when they faced Michigan Tech. The game was a debacle for the visitors as Harvard won 11–0 and looked well on their way to giving Yale a run for the intercollegiate championship. After another win over Boston University, Harvard welcomed Marquette to the Boston Garden on February 5 but the three-week layoff since their previous game appeared to have the Crimson champing at the bit. Harvard took 10 penalties during the game, giving Marquette two separate 5-on-3 advantages. The Crimson defense responded well, holding back the Hilltoppers through most of the game, but Marquette slowly built a 2–1 lead and carried into the third period. With only 5 minutes remaining both teams began a furious effort to score and four goals were made at the end of the game, however, Harvard couldn't catch Marquette and lost 3–4.\nHarvard had their two series against Dartmouth and Yale remaining and redoubled their defensive efforts for the contests. In the two games against the Indians Harvard surrendered just one goal and then had a two week wait for the showdown with their arch rival. The Elis entered the series undefeated for the second year in a row and Harvard would have the honor of trying to spoil their season once more. In the first game the two traded one-goals leads but by the end of 60 minutes the score was tied 2–2 and another overtime thriller was in the making. Harvard double-teamed Hale Palmer, the Elis' high-scoring winger, every time he touched the puck which enabled captain Putnam to score the winner early in the 10-minute extra-session.\nThe following week Harvard again prevented Palmer from scoring, but his work in the offensive end caused two of Yale's goals and the Bulldogs won the rematch 3–1. The playoff between the two would decide the Intercollegiate title and both teams prepared for a battle. Harvard, who had been outshone by Yale through most of the season, took two leads during the game but was unable to hold onto either for too long and, once more, overtime was required. Rather than attack, Yale held back, playing a defensive style much like Harvard and the two teams rarely threatened each other's netminders. The result was three rather dull overtime periods and the game ended in a draw.\nPlans for a fourth and (hopefully) deciding game began immediately after the contest was over. A few days later, after a conference between the athletic directors of each school, W. J. Bingham of Harvard ultimately decided to end the Crimson's ice hockey season and leave the two without a clear victor. 1930 was the first time since 1900 that Harvard and Yale's ice hockey teams finished with a draw over the course of a season. The result was that both teams had claims to the eastern intercollegiate championship and would have to share the crown.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "Michael Anthony Williams (born June 26, 2004) is an American basketball player for the UCF Knights of the Big 12 Conference. He previously played for Vertical Academy, Lake Norman Christian High School, in North Carolina and San Ysidro High School. He had committed to play for the Memphis Tigers although he never played, he will make his debut after his court case.\nEarly life.\nWilliams first held a basketball when he was 11 months old and grew up playing under the guidance of his father and mother. In his childhood, he mainly played on an outdoor court in his apartment complex. In elementary school, Williams was often involved in fights with bullies. He worked as a ball boy for San Ysidro High School head coach Terry Tucker, who said that \"he couldn't keep (Williams) out of the gym.\" In sixth grade while playing with the San Diego Sharks, Williams had his first official game dunk at 12 years old (April 15, 2017). He went on to play for the Malcolm Thomas All-Stars travel team. In seventh and eighth grades, he was ranked the number one player in the 2023 class by the Naismith National Youth All-American Report. In eighth grade, Williams joined the North Coast Blue Chips Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) team, where he rose to fame while playing alongside Bronny James the son of basketball player LeBron James. In 2019, he played for the Compton Magic on the AAU circuit.\nHigh school career.\nAs a freshman, Williams played for San Ysidro High School in San Diego. On November 20, 2019, he made his high school debut, recording 46 points, five rebounds, four assists and four steals in a 98–46 win over El Cajon Valley High School. In his next game, an 85–77 victory over Mission Bay High School, Williams scored 50 points. On December 13, he scored a career-high 77 points, making nine three-pointers, in a 116–52 win over Kearny High School. He broke the CIF San Diego Section (CIF-SDS) single-game scoring record, previously held by Tyrone Shelley since 2005, and set the state freshman record for single-game scoring. On January 10, 2020, Williams recorded 35 points in a 103–71 loss to top 2020 recruit Evan Mobley and Rancho Christian School, one of the best high school teams in the country. He led San Ysidro to the CIF-SDS Division III title on February 27. As a freshman, Williams averaged 29.9 points, 6.7 rebounds and 4.9 assists per game and was named MaxPreps National Freshman of the Year.\nEntering his sophomore season, Williams transferred to Lake Norman Christian School in Huntersville, North Carolina.\nOn April 9, 2022, Williams announced that he would return home to San Diego and play for his original high school, San Ysidro High School, for his senior year.\nRecruiting.\nWilliams is considered a four-star recruit in the 2023 class by 247Sports, ESPN and Rivals. He received offers from many NCAA Division I programs, including Arizona and Arizona State, before starting his high school career. In June 2020, Williams was offered basketball scholarships by several historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) after showing interest in playing for an HBCU on social media.\nOn November 5, 2022, Williams committed to play for the University of Memphis for head coach Penny Hardaway, starting in 2023–24.\nCollege.\nOn November 5, 2022, Williams committed to play for the University of Memphis for head coach Penny Hardaway, starting in 2023–24.\nHowever he never joined the basketball team stemming from a criminal investigation in California, where Williams was facing gun charges and shooting at trespassers at his property. He did enroll in online courses at the University of Memphis however. \nIn late December 2023, Williams charges were reduced to volunteer work and was cleared to play college basketball.\nOn January 8, 2024, Mikey Williams and fellow Memphis Tiger Freshman, JJ Taylor both entered the NCAA transfer portal mid season.\nOn January 12, 2024, Williams announced he was transferring to the University of Central Florida (UCF).\nPersonal life.\nWilliams' father, Mahlon, played basketball for Sweetwater High School, where he was an All-CIF-SDS selection. His mother, Charisse, played softball for Kearny High School and Hampton University.\nApril 2023 arrest.\nOn April 13, 2023, Williams was arrested in Jamul, California, on five charges of assault with a deadly weapon; he was released on $50,000 bail the following day. San Diego County Sheriff's Department's Lieutenant Gavin Lanning said Williams is likely to face only one charge, carrying a maximum sentence of up to four years in prison (minimum 6 months). On April 14, 2023, the University of Memphis released a statement saying, \"We are aware of the situation and are gathering more information.\" On April 20, 2023, Williams pleaded not guilty to multiple charges of assault with a deadly weapon. Due to security concerns, his attorney said the court appearance was virtual. Williams is accused of violating California penal code Chapter 9, Section 245(a)(2), which involves \"any person who commits an assault upon the person of another with a firearm.\" According to police, Williams fired a gun at a car full of people following an altercation at his residence. Each count can carry up to four years in prison. Williams was initially required to appear either in-person or virtually on June 29, 2023, for a preliminary hearing, but the hearing was subsequently rescheduled to July 12, 2023, after his legal team told a judge they needed more time after receiving additional information regarding the incident. On July 6, 2023, his hearing was postponed for a second time in less than a month, with a new hearing date scheduled for September 5, 2023.\nOn September 5, 2023, the hearing was postponed for a third time, until October 10, 2023. As a result of the hearing, Judge Sherry M. Thompson-Taylor ordered Williams to stand trial on six felony gun charges and scheduled his arraignment for October 24, 2023. Judge Thompson-Taylor denied the prosecution's request to increase Williams' bail to $500,000 and allowed Williams to remain free on a $50,000 bond. During his October 24 arraignment, three additional felony charges were filed against Williams: one count of assault with a weapon and two counts of making threats.\nOn November 30, 2023, Williams pled guilty to one charge. Williams evaded jail time and is sentenced to deal with his misdemeanor by taking classes.\nSocial media and endorsements.\nWilliams has established a large social media following. He had over one million Instagram followers before starting high school. By the end of his freshman year of high school, he had almost 2 million followers on Instagram, including musician Drake and NBA players LeBron James and Kevin Durant. Williams had accumulated 3.2 million followers on Instagram by the end of his sophomore year in high school.\nOn July 22, 2021, Williams signed a contract with Excel Sports Management to pursue Name, Image and Likeness endorsement opportunities.\nOn October 28, 2021, Williams signed a multi-year endorsement deal with Puma, making him the first American high school basketball player to sign a sneaker deal with a global footwear company, at 17 years old. Puma ended Williams' endorsement deal as a result of his pending legal issues."

        "title": "Bobby Watson (basketball coach)",
        "text": "Robert Lee Watson (August 8, 1942 – December 13, 1977) was an American basketball coach. He was in his first season as a head coach for the Evansville Purple Aces men's basketball team when he and his team were killed in the 1977 Air Indiana Flight 216 crash.\nWatson was a college basketball player for the VMI Keydets and began his coaching career at a Virginia high school. His early coaching career was interrupted by two stints in the Vietnam War but he returned as an assistant coach for the Xavier Musketeers. Watson first came to prominence as the head coach for the Ferrum Panthers from 1971 to 1973. He worked as an assistant coach for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons and the Oral Roberts Golden Eagles. Watson was hired as the head coach of the Purple Aces in 1977 for their first season as a member of NCAA Division I competition and had amassed a 1–3 record at the time of his death.\nCollege and military career.\nWatson was a star basketball and baseball player while he attended Bethel Park High School in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, and was offered a basketball scholarship to attend the Virginia Military Institute. He played college basketball for the VMI Keydets from 1961 to 1964, where he led the team in rebounds during his sophomore and senior seasons. Watson served as a team captain during his senior season when the Keydets won the 1964 Southern Conference championship.\nInstead of playing professionally, Watson embarked on a coaching career immediately after the end of his college stint and was hired by William Fleming High School in Roanoke, Virginia. Watson entered the United States Army in 1965 and served two tours in the Vietnam War as a member of the 101st Airborne Division. He was shot out of a helicopter three times and once narrowly escaped death when his disabled helicopter fell 75 feet into a rice paddy field, which cushioned the crash. Watson was awarded two Bronze Star Medals, the Commendation Medal and five Purple Hearts.\nCoaching career.\nAssistant roles and Ferrum College.\nAfter his first eighteen-month Vietnam tour, he served as an assistant coach for the Xavier Musketeers for one season. He returned to the Musketeers after his second Vietnam stint in 1969. Watson was highly regarded for his prospect recruiting abilities while serving under head coach George Krajack, who had personally recruited Watson to the program. When Krajack resigned in 1971, Watson also left the Musketeers out of loyalty to Krajack.\nWatson desired a head coaching role and discovered a vacancy at Ferrum College while reading a newspaper. He served as the head coach for the Ferrum Panthers men's basketball team from 1971 to 1973 and amassed a 61–8 record. Watson's success at Ferrum brought him national attention, including a head coaching offer from the Musketeers. He instead accepted an offer to become an assistant coach for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons and served there from 1973 to 1974. In 1974, he was hired as an assistant coach for the Oral Roberts Golden Eagles.\nEvansville.\nWatson was offered the head coaching job for the Evansville Purple Aces in 1977 after the previous candidate, Jerry Sloan, had turned down the offer following a week with the program. It was the Aces' first season in 31 years without head coach Arad McCutchan, who had led the team to five NCAA Division II championships. It was also the team's first season as a member of NCAA Division I and Watson entered the program with high expectations. Watson promised to stay with the Aces \"as long as [they] will have me.\"\nWatson had an excellent recruitment period and signed nine freshmen to join the team for the 1977–78 season, whom he believed to be \"as fine a nucleus as we could have brought in for the coming years.\" He also launched public relation campaigns with local community leaders to improve ticket sales and ultimately sold 1,000 new season tickets in the few weeks after he was hired. Evansville business manager Bob Hudson stated, \"I've never seen a man work so hard or more so fast.\" Watson came to be seen by Aces supporters as the savior of their program.\nThe Aces lost their first two games of the season to the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers and the DePaul Blue Demons. Their first and only win of the season came on December 6, 1977, against the Pittsburgh Panthers. After the game, Watson remarked, \"I've been involved in a lot of wins, but few sweeter than that one.\" The Aces' final game was a loss on December 10, 1977, against the Indiana State Sycamores. After the game, Watson stated that his team needed more courage and mental toughness when playing away games.\nOn December 13, 1977, the Purple Aces were to fly to Nashville, Tennessee, to play the Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders the following night. The Aces teams under McCutchan would often travel to away games on the same day, but Watson preferred to fly a day early to allow his players to practice on the host's court. The team's plane had been delayed by three hours due to bad weather. Shortly after take-off at around 7:20pm from the Evansville Regional Airport, the plane suffered an engine failure and crashed, which killed all 29 people on board. Watson was the only coach on board the flight as his assistant coaches were on scouting assignments at the time. The University of Evansville cancelled the rest of the Purple Aces' season after briefly considering carrying on with a substitute team, which Evansville athletic director Jim Byers stated would be what Watson would have wanted.\nLegacy.\nWatson was inducted into the Evansville Purple Aces Hall of Fame in 1978 and the Ferrum College Alumni Sports Hall of Fame in 1997. Ferrum College offers the Bobby Watson Endowed Scholarship, which is awarded to students with an interest in athletics."

The Blue Raiders represent Middle Tennessee State University in the NCAA's Conference USA.\nMiddle Tennessee began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1913. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Middle Tennessee's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

The location of the game alternates between State Farm Center, formerly Assembly Hall, in Champaign, and in Evanston at Welsh–Ryan Arena. There have only been a total of five neutral site games in this series with Illinois winning all of those games. Illinois leads the series 137–43.\nOccasional feuds and incidents between the schools' programs have fueled the competition over the years. Illinois has the advantage in the history of the Big Ten tournament. Of the 20+ years the conference tournament has been held, Illinois and Northwestern have played a total of 3 times. Illinois holds the record of 3–0 over Northwestern.\nAccomplishments by the two rivals.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs.\nGame results.\nWinning team is shown. Ranking of the team at the time of the game by the AP poll is shown by the team name."

He broke Richie Richardson's long standing record of 132 matches.\nMost matches as captain.\nRicky Ponting, who led the Australian cricket team from 2002 to 2012, holds the record for the most matches played as captain in ODIs with 230 (including 1 as captain of ICC World XI team).Asghar Afghan, the current skipper, has led Afghansitan team the most number of times.\nYoungest players on Debut.\nThe youngest player to play in an ODI match is claimed to be Hasan Raza at the age of 14 years and 233 days. Making his debut for Pakistan against Zimbabwe on 30 October 1996, there is some doubt as to the validity of Raza's age at the time. The youngest Afghanistan to play ODIs is Mujeeb Ur Rahman who at the age of 16 years and 252 days debuted in the first ODI of the series against Ireland in December 2017.\nPartnership records.\nIn cricket, two batsmen are always present at the crease batting together in a partnership. This partnership will continue until one of them is dismissed, retires or the innings comes to a close.\nHighest partnerships by wicket.\nA wicket partnership describes the number of runs scored before each wicket falls. The first wicket partnership is between the opening batsmen and continues until the first wicket falls. The second wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the number three batsman. This partnership continues until the second wicket falls. The third wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the new batsman. This continues down to the tenth wicket partnership. When the tenth wicket has fallen, there is no batsman left to partner so the innings is closed.\nHighest partnerships by runs.\nThe highest ODI partnership by runs for any wicket is held by the West Indian pairing of Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels who put together a second wicket partnership of 372 runs during the 2015 Cricket World Cup against Zimbabwe in February 2015. This broke the record of 331 runs set by Indian pair of Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid against New Zealand in 1999\nUmpiring records.\nMost matches umpired.\nAn umpire in cricket is a person who officiates the match according to the \"Laws of Cricket\". Two umpires adjudicate the match on the field, whilst a third umpire has access to video replays, and a fourth umpire looks after the match balls and other duties. The records below are only for on-field umpires.\nRudi Koertzen of South Africa holds the record for the most ODI matches umpired with 209. The current active Aleem Dar is currently at 208 matches. They are followed by New Zealand's Billy Bowden who officiated in 200 matches. The most experienced Afghanistan umpire is Ahmed Shah Pakteen who has stood in 12 ODI matches."

        "title": "Oireachtas Golf Society scandal",
        "text": "The Oireachtas Golf Society scandal, also known informally as \"Golfgate\", was a political scandal in Ireland involving past and present members of that country's parliament, the Oireachtas, who attended a gathering of the Oireachtas Golf Society in Clifden, County Galway, on 19 August 2020.\nThe gathering took place during public health guidelines that had been issued in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland. A total of 81 guests attended a dinner organised by the society, including a number of high-profile Oireachtas members; the European Commissioner for Trade, Phil Hogan; and a Supreme Court judge, Séamus Woulfe.\nFollowing the publication of the story on 20 August by the \"Irish Examiner\", there was widespread public anger across Ireland that attendees had allegedly contravened restrictions that had been drafted by the ruling Fianna Fáil–Fine Gael–Green Party coalition government, one of whose ministers was in attendance at the dinner. It was later determined that the event did not breach the rules.\nThe scandal resulted in the resignations of Hogan; the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Deputy Leader of Fianna Fáil, Dara Calleary; and the Leas-Chathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann, Jerry Buttimer. It also resulted in calls for a number of other resignations, and the affair was seen to have shaken public confidence in the coalition government. Four people were later prosecuted for their roles as organisers of the event. The Court acquitted them of all charges, saying that the event had been organised within the rules and with due care to public health.\nBackground.\nUnder the third phase of a roadmap issued by the government for reopening the national economy after the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, indoor gatherings of up to 50 people had been permissible since 29 June when conducted in line with public health advice.\nHowever, in response to an increase in confirmed cases, Taoiseach Micheál Martin announced on 18 August that more restrictive measures would be reintroduced across the country until 13 September, in an effort to limit the spread of the virus. Among the restrictions announced were a limit on indoor gatherings and events to six people from no more than three households, with exemptions granted for weddings, certain religious ceremonies and cultural facilities, provided appropriate protective measures could be maintained.\nOn 20 August, \"Irish Examiner\" journalists Aoife-Grace Moore and Paul Hosford reported on an event organised by the Oireachtas Golf Society that took place over two days in Clifden, County Galway, including a dinner on 19 August at the Station House Hotel. The event, organised by the society's captain, Independent TD Noel Grealish, and its president, former Fianna Fáil Senator Donie Cassidy, was organised as a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the society, as well as a commemoration of the death of former Fianna Fáil MEP, Mark Killilea Jnr, in 2018. It consisted of games of golf and a gala dinner. The golfing competitions, held over the two days at Connemara Golf Links in Ballyconneely, were won by Niall Blaney and Gerry Brady. The dinner was held in a single room with a removable dividing partition, splitting the 81 attendees into 45 and 36 people on either side in an effort to enforce social distancing. Newspaper reports stated that not only had social distancing not been properly observed at the dinner, but public health advice had generally not been observed.\nIt was also reported that former independent TD and Monaghan County Council member, Paudge Connolly, had attended the dinner despite playing in another golf event in Spain just nine days previously. This meant that he could not have been compliant with the 14-day period of restricted movements that was mandatory for people entering Ireland from Spain, under the then-current travel restrictions enforced by the government.\nReaction and consequences.\nFollowing the breaking of the story, the gathering was criticised heavily across Irish society.\nThe Taoiseach, Micheál Martin, was described as \"furious\" about the event, and in particular by the attendance of Dara Calleary. Calleary resigned as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on 21 August, stating in an interview to MidWest Radio that \"[he] made a big mistake. [He] shouldn't have gone to the function. [He] didn't want to let people down and [he takes] responsibility for that mistake\". He elaborated by saying his actions had undermined the work of frontline workers in Ireland and he was deeply sorry for having done so.\nCalleary's resignation made him the second Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to lose his job in less than two months, following the sacking of Barry Cowen on 14 July 2020 for a controversy surrounding driving under the influence of alcohol. Coverage of Calleary's resignation was covered not just domestically, but also internationally, with the story featuring in \"The New York Times\", BBC News, \"The Guardian\", Euronews, \"The Times\", Politico, \"Le Parisien\", \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\", and \"Ouest-France\". In addition to his ministerial role, Calleary resigned as deputy leader and national secretary of Fianna Fáil.\nAs well as the resignations of Calleary and Leas-Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann, Jerry Buttimer, six senators who attended the event also lost the party whip as punishment.\nSpeaking on \"\" on Friday 21 August, Martin would not comment on the position of judge Séamus Woulfe – citing the need for legislature not to interfere with the judiciary in line with the Constitution of Ireland – but while he suggested that Phil Hogan should apologise for attending the event, Martin declined to comment on whether he should resign, saying that Hogan's position was a matter for the European Commission. Following initial reluctance, Hogan apologised for his attendance at the event on 22 August.\nPresident of Sinn Féin and Leader of the Opposition, Mary Lou McDonald, heavily criticised both the gathering and the government, stating that the government had \"descended into new levels of chaos\". McDonald had requested that the Dáil be recalled from its summer recess, but this was initially rejected by Martin. In response, McDonald stated that Martin was wrong, that the government had lost its direction and that it needed to be held to account. McDonald also said that she had been unaware of the existence of an Oireachtas golf society, and questioned the ethics of an organisation that allowed wealthy donors to interact with members of the Oireachtas.\nThe Leader of the Labour Party, Alan Kelly, said that not only had the government lost the confidence of the people, but also that he had rarely seen such public anger in response to a political issue as to the event. The co-leader of the Social Democrats, Catherine Murphy, called the event \"inexcusable\" and asked for the Dáil to be reconvened.\nWhile Martin resisted calls on 21 August to recall the Dáil – which was on summer break – the government announced on Sunday 23 August that the Dáil would return sooner than planned, most likely by Tuesday 15 September.\nThe Garda Síochána announced on 21 August that they would be investigating the event to see if it breached the Health Act 1947, which was amended on 20 March 2020 to include public health regulations pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the immediate wake of the scandal, Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl requested that the Oireachtas Golf Society be disbanded with immediate effect.\nOn 22 August the Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, used discretionary powers under the 2005 Garda Síochána Act to inform the government that Hogan had been stopped by the Garda Síochána in County Kildare for using a mobile phone while driving – a criminal offence punishable by three penalty points and an €80 fine – on his way to Clifden. Hogan's very presence in the county was an issue in itself, as it was under a local lockdown at the time, meaning that Hogan would have been entitled to travel to the county for essential purposes such as work, but not to leave again for non-essential purposes such as attending the golf dinner. In light of this, Martin and the Tánaiste, Leo Varadkar, changed their stance on Hogan retaining his European Commission portfolio; Martin publicly suggested that Hogan should \"reconsider his position\", and the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, requested a detailed report from Hogan on the matter. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Darragh O'Brien, called on Hogan to resign, while the Minister of State for European Affairs, Thomas Byrne, stated that what he called Hogan's \"unclear answers\" on the issue damaged confidence in politics and the EU, and that President von der Leyen must consider this when considering Hogan's report.\nIt was announced on 24 August that the Supreme Court had requested a former Chief Justice, Susan Denham, to report on Woulfe's attendance at the dinner, including the question of whether he should have accepted the invitation and whether \"he should in all the circumstances have left the hotel in light of the situation prevailing\". On the same day, it was also reported that former Taoiseach and Leader of Fine Gael, Enda Kenny, had participated in the golf competitions arranged as part of the event, but declined to participate in the gala dinner, telling others that he thought it was \"a bad idea\" and would \"send out the wrong signal to the general public\". RTÉ announced that further projects involving Seán O'Rourke, which had been planned, would not now proceed.\nOn 25 August, Hogan published a timeline of his movements since his he arrival in Ireland from Brussels on 31 July, including new details of a trip to Adare to play golf on 13 August. It was noted that Hogan was admitted to a Dublin hospital on 5 August, where he tested negative for COVID-19; he was discharged from hospital and returned to a temporary residence in County Kildare the following day. On 7 August, hours before a local lockdown was enforced in Kildare, Hogan travelled to County Kilkenny; from there, he travelled to Dublin for essential work purposes on 12 August. After playing golf in Adare on 13 August, he returned to Kilkenny, and travelled to Clifden via Kildare on 17 August. Hogan participated in the golf competitions on 18 and 19 August and attended the gala dinner, before returning to his temporary residence in Kildare on 21 August, and to Brussels the following day. Following publication of this timeline, reports appeared in the media claiming that Hogan had been seen at public restaurants with other individuals during this period, including on the evening of his arrival in Ireland, and that he had made a further trip to County Roscommon on 17 August for social purposes; these previously undisclosed details were seen as contradicting Hogan's own timeline.\nMartin, Varadkar and the Leader of the Green Party, Eamon Ryan, released a joint statement on 25 August, stating that while it is clear Hogan breached COVID-19 public health guidelines, they welcomed his apology. Facing increased pressure in both Brussels and Dublin, Phil Hogan resigned as Trade Commissioner on 26 August.\nOn 9 November, correspondence between Mr Justice Frank Clarke and Mr Justice Woulfe were published in which the Chief Justice reprimanded Woulfe for his response to the scandal and stated that it was his opinion that Woulfe should resign in order to avoid continuing serious damage to the judiciary. The Government responded on 10 November by acknowledging the serious constitutional issues that have arisen as a result of this.\nThe scandal was compared to the earlier Dominic Cummings scandal that occurred in the United Kingdom.\nCriminal prosecution.\nIn February 2021, it was announced by the Director of Public Prosecutions that four people would be criminally prosecuted for their role in organising the event. Amongst the four were Noel Grealish and Donie Cassidy. In May, Grealish was issued a summons for a court date of 22 July. The case was adjourned until 28 October. It was revealed on 28 October that the trial would get under way in early January 2022 and could take five days to be heard as there are over 50 witnesses. The four men (Grealish, Cassidy, along with James and John Sweeney, of the Station House Hotel in Clifden) went on trial on 6 January 2022, charged with breaching the COVID-19 regulations. District Court Judge Mary Fahy dismissed all the charges on 3 February. The Court concluded: \"They were all responsible people who would not have gone to a dinner unless they felt comfortable and unless the organisers had not put in place all that was required to make it safe.\" Grealish said he was \"delighted with the outcome\". Donie Cassidy, described as being emotional when leaving the court, said he was always a lawmaker and never a law-breaker."

The runner-up in the 2020 World Championship was also included. The field consisted of 16 players but with some players winning more than one qualifying event, there were less than 16 qualifying players. The remainder of the field was determined by the highest ranking player, not already qualified, at the time it was certain that a place would not be taken by a winner of the qualifying events. The first player to receive an entry this way was Mark Allen, who was ranked 5th after the 2020 European Masters (2020–21 season). The second player to receive an entry this way was John Higgins, who was ranked 8th after the 2020 English Open. The third and final player to receive an entry this way was David Gilbert, who was ranked 11th after the 2020 Championship League.\nCentury breaks.\nA total of 31 were made during the tournament."

Early in the season, however, the team didn't perform well. After a less-than-impressive win over MIT the Crimson lost three consecutive games, however, two of those losses were to Canadian schools and the experience from playing tougher squads served Harvard well. When they opened their conference schedule against Princeton Harvard started slow but built up steam after the first to score the final three goals of the game, including an overtime winner from new sophomore star John Chase. The rematch came at the end of the month and the Crimson again had to come back from a two-goal deficit to win another 4–3 match and capture the season series.\nHarvard began February with a game against undefeated Hamilton but the Crimson proved superior with a dominating 11–1 victory. The team then had a 10-day layoff before the long-awaited match with Yale. From the start of the game Harvard assailed the Eli net and scored just five minutes in. Three more goals came from Crimson players with none in opposition giving Harvard the first leg of the series. The following week Harvard faced a dangerous Dartmouth team and downed the Indians 3–2 in overtime. In doing so the Crimson had essentially erased their early-season loss to Boston University by defeating two teams that had defeated the Terriers (Williams and Dartmouth) while remaining unbeaten against all other colleges.\nHarvard, however, still had one final game to play and the rematch with Yale was held at the Madison Square Garden, the home of the New York Americans. The game was played before some 11,000 spectators, by far the largest recorded crowd for a college game at the time, and saw Harvard fight a much tougher contest with the Elis than the first game. Harvard scored first but were unable to find the net again and had to carry a slim, 1–0 lead for most of the game. Captain Cummings did everything he could to keep the Elis from scoring and even with a furious effort in the third period the Yale scoresheet remained empty. Harvard tacked on a second goal just before the end of the game for a sweep of the Triangular League and a claim for the eastern Intercollegiate Championship.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The Ojai Tennis Tournament, often shortened to The Ojai, is an annual tennis tournament in Ventura County, California, headquartered at Libbey Park in downtown Ojai, about north of Los Angeles. The event, first held in 1896, is the oldest and largest amateur tennis tournament in the United States held in one location.\nOverview.\nThe Ojai Tennis Tournament is one of North America’s largest amateur tennis tournaments, with 1,500 tennis players, up from the 12 players in the initial tournament in 1896 and 500 entrants in 1949. The tournament is played over several days throughout the Ojai Valley and elsewhere in western Ventura County, with final matches and marquee events held at Libbey Park in Ojai. Venues include parks, schools, private clubs, hotels, and even private residences.\nAs of 2021, the event features 27 divisions, including men's and women's open divisions and several dedicated to collegiate and youth players. The Pac-12 Conference conducts its team championships at The Ojai, and the California Community College Athletic Association additionally crowns singles and doubles champions. The Ojai also features CIF Southern Section high school boys' singles and doubles competition as the tournament falls within the association's boys' tennis season. Other divisions include NCAA Division III athletes, men's independent college players (i.e., from non-Pac-12 four-year institutions), and juniors.\nHistory.\nThe Ojai Tennis Tournament can trace its beginnings to 1887, when Sherman Day Thacher arrived in the Ojai Valley to pursue citrus farming. To raise funds for his enterprise, he started tutoring students on his ranch known as Casa de Piedra. With the later arrival of his brother William Thacher, a collegiate tennis champion at Yale, the ranch became home to the valley's first tennis court in 1892 and hosted Ojai's first tennis tournament the following year. (Casa de Piedra evolved into The Thacher School, the oldest boarding school in California still in operation.) William Thacher established the Ojai Valley Tennis Club in 1895. The inaugural Ojai Tennis Tournament matched the Ojai Valley and Ventura tennis clubs, with the pool of eligible entrants later expanding to include neighboring counties and eventually all of California. By 1912, it was the largest amateur tennis tournament in the US with 272 competitors in 12 events.\nThe Ojai was forced to move to the YMCA courts in Los Angeles because of World War I and two big fires in 1918, and to Santa Barbara in 1919.\nIn 1922, tournament entrance fees were $1 ($ in current dollar terms), and grounds admission (including afternoon tea) was $.50 ($ in current dollar terms) on the first day and $.75 ($ in current dollar terms) on the last day. In 1924, an outbreak of a cattle disease called hoof-and-mouth disease led to a halt to travel, and the consequent cancellation of the tournament.\nIn 2018, for the first time its history, the Ojai Tennis Tournament offered equal prize money to men and women in its Open divisions.\nThe Ojai Tennis Tournament has been canceled seven times since its inception. In addition to its 1924 cancellation, the tournament was not held from 1943 to 1946 because of World War II. The Ojai was again canceled in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNotable participants in the Ojai Tennis Tournament include May Sutton, Bill Tilden, Tony Trabert, Bobby Riggs, Jack Kramer, Billie Jean King, Allen Fox,Arthur Ashe, Stan Smith, Jimmy Connors, Tracy Austin, Lindsay Davenport, Pete Sampras, Michael Chang, Mackenzie McDonald, and the Bryan twins."

        "text": "Jose Alvarado (born April 12, 1998) is a Puerto Rican professional basketball player for the New Orleans Pelicans of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is nicknamed \"Grand Theft Alvarado\" due to his ability to create steals. Alvarado represents Puerto Rico internationally since 2022. He played college basketball for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets.\nEarly life and high school career.\nAlvarado played football in his childhood but quit after injuring his neck. He played basketball for Christ the King Regional High School in Middle Village, Queens in New York City. As a junior, Alvarado averaged 17 points and 6.5 assists per game and was named Catholic High School Athletic Association (CHSAA) Player of the Year. As a senior, he recorded 18 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists and 10 steals, the first quadruple-double in school history, in a December 22, 2016, win over Xaverian High School. In his senior season, Alvarado averaged 17.9 points per game and led Christ the King to the CHSAA intersectional quarterfinals. He was named TimesLedger Player of the Year.\nRecruiting.\nAlvarado was considered a four-star recruit by ESPN and Rivals and a three-star recruit by 247Sports in the 2017 class. On September 15, 2016, he committed to play college basketball for Georgia Tech over offers from Rutgers and Seton Hall, among others. Georgia Tech head coach Josh Pastner had first seen Alvarado at the Nike Elite Youth Basketball League.\nCollege career.\nAs a freshman, Alvarado started in all 25 of his games and averaged 12.1 points, 3.7 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game. He became the fourth Georgia Tech freshman to average at least 12 points, 3.5 rebounds, and two assists per game. He suffered a season-ending left elbow fracture against Duke on February 11, 2018. Alvarado had an increased role in his sophomore season with the early departure of Josh Okogie. On February 20, 2019, Alvarado scored a career-high 29 points to go with six rebounds and five assists in a 73–65 win over Pittsburgh. As a sophomore, Alvarado averaged 12.5 points, 3.9 rebounds and 3.4 assists per game, leading his team in scoring, assists and steals. Georgia Tech was banned from the postseason by the NCAA during his junior season due to several infractions. He missed seven games early in his junior season due to an ankle injury. On January 25, 2020, Alvarado scored a season-high 26 points and recorded eight rebounds and a school-record nine steals in a 64–58 victory over NC State. In his junior season, he averaged 14.4 points, four assists, 3.4 rebounds and 2.2 steals per game and was named to the Third Team All-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). In his senior year, Alvarado and Moses Wright led Georgia Tech to its first ACC title since 1993, by defeating Scottie Barnes and Florida State in the championship game of the ACC tournament. At the end of the season, he was named the ACC Defensive Player of the Year.\nProfessional career.\nNew Orleans Pelicans (2021–present).\nAlvarado passed on gaining an additional year in college due to COVID-19 game cancellations and declared himself eligible for the 2021 NBA draft. After being undrafted, on August 19, 2021, he signed a two-way contract with the New Orleans Pelicans. Under the terms of the deal, he split time with the Pelicans and their NBA G League affiliate, the Birmingham Squadron. During a game against the Philadelphia 76ers on January 25, 2022, Alvarado was issued a technical foul after an in-game verbal altercation with Philadelphia center Joel Embiid. The incident received press coverage after Embiid praised Alvarado and paid the $2,000 league fine associated with it. On March 28, Alvarado's two-way deal was converted into a standard 4-year, $6.5 million contract. This signing made him eligible for post-season play.\nIn 2022, Alvarado gained social media traction for highlight clips of him creating steals by sneaking up behind the opposing team's ball handler, which also led to his nickname \"Grand Theft Alvarado\".\nOn December 4, 2022, Alvarado scored a career-high 38 points in a 121–106 win over the Denver Nuggets.

        "text": "Robert W. Gale (April 22, 1925 – May 29, 1975) was an American basketball player. He was an All-American college player at Cornell and a first-round pick in the 1948 BAA draft.\nGale went to Andrew Jackson High School in New York City and came to Cornell in 1943 as part of a Naval training program. Due to the shortage of college-aged players brought about by World War II, Gale was one of many freshmen nationwide who were allowed to play despite NCAA eligibility rules of the day. He quickly captured the starting center spot for the Big Red. At the close of the season he was named to the All-Eastern Intercollegiate League team. Following the regular season, Gale's V-12 training program moved him to conference rival Dartmouth. Dartmouth had won the Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League but had lost seven of its top ten players to military service. Gale was added as was Haggerty Award winner Dick McGuire from St. John's. The two newcomers joined All-American Aud Brindley to lead the Indians all the way to the national championship game, which they lost to Utah in overtime. Gale had a memorable performance in the team's opening game against Catholic University, leading Dartmouth in scoring with 17 points.\nAfter two years serving in the U.S. Navy, Gale returned to Cornell in 1946 to continue his college career and was named captain of the team. However, he sustained a knee \ninjury that caused him to miss the majority of the season. Gale returned to the hardwood for the 1947–48 season and was again named captain. Gale was again named to the all-conference first team and was named a second-team All-American by the Helms Athletic Foundation. Following the season, Gale was named to the East squad of the college All-Star game.\nFollowing his college career, Gale was drafted by the St. Louis Bombers in the 1948 BAA draft, however he never played in the Basketball Association of America (BAA) or the NBA. He played briefly for the New York Athletic Club and various barnstorming teams before entering business in 1950 with the Gold Seal Company. He was with the company for 25 years before dying unexpectedly due to a heart attack at age 50 on May 29, 1975, on a business trip in Skokie, Illinois."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. As of the next college basketball season in 2024–25, the Jaguars represent Indiana University Indianapolis in the NCAA Division I Horizon League. This will follow the dissolution of Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis by the Indiana University and Purdue University systems at the end of the 2023–24 academic year and the establishment of separate IU- and Purdue-affiliated institutions. The athletic program has not announced its future branding; IU Indianapolis and IUI are both possibilities.\nIUI began competing in intercollegiate basketball as IUPUI in 1972. The NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but IUPUI/IUI record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "Christopher P. Ray was an American ice hockey forward who played for Colorado College after World War II and helped the program win its first National Championship in 1950.\nCareer.\nAfter helping the US National Team to a 5th-place finish at the 1947 Ice Hockey World Championships, Ray was one of a slew of talented players who joined Colorado College after the second World War. He helped pushing the team to a 19-7 record in his freshman season and earning the Tigers a bid into the first NCAA Tournament. CC fell to Dartmouth in the semifinal but the team returned to the tournament the following year, only to lost both games by a rather large margin. Ray had one more chance to win a national championship in his junior season (the NCAA restricted athletes to three years of varsity eligibility at the time), and the team responded with one of the most overpowering offensive seasons in NCAA history. While the team again finished 2nd in the west behind Michigan, CC scored 167 goals in just 22 games, an average of more than 7.5 goals per game. Ray netted 26 of those markers himself and, in the semifinal against Boston College, Ray's 3-point night helped put the Eagles away.\nThe Tigers made their first Championship appearance against Boston University and the two teams remained close after 40 minutes. In the third period, however, Colorado College exploded for 10 goals (an NCAA record as of 2020) with Ray having a hand in half (three goals and two assists). CC won the game 13-4 setting a record for the most goals scored by one team in the championship game (tied with CC in 1957), the most goals scored by both teams in the championship game (surpassed by 19 from CC and Michigan in 1957), the largest margin of victory (surpassed by +10 from Denver in 1961), the most goals scored (23) and the widest margin of victory (+16) in a Frozen Four (still NCAA records). Ray's four goals in the Championship set a new NCAA record that has been tied twice but never surpassed as of 2020. His two assists also left him with 6 points which tied the NCAA record that still stands as of 2020. Ray holds the distinction of scoring the most goals in the final game of any player to not be named Most Outstanding Player. The 31 goals he scored on the year earned Ray a place on the AHCA All-American Second Team while his tournament exploits went entirely unrecognized. Ray played one more year at CC before graduating and finished his college career as the Tigers' all-time scoring leader with 173 points in 99 games. Ray held the program record for 23 years until he was surpassed by Doug Palazzari during the 1973–74 season."

Unlike the previous three coaches, however, Stubbs had not been a member of the team. That seemed to make little difference when the team began the season with a 9–0 drubbing of MIT. The Crimson played well thorough the early part of their season, winning their first three games before dropping a match against McGill at Madison Square Garden.\nHarvard dominated in their next two games, but those matches were spread out over a month. By mid-February the Crimson had played only three games from the start of the year and when they met Dartmouth the Indians finally broke through with their first win over Harvard in four years. Following their second loss, Harvard had just its series with Yale remaining and the two titans fought a close battle in the first match. Regulation ended in a 1–1 draw and the arrangement between the two teams called for two 5-minute overtime periods to be played. John Chase scored mid-way through the first and then the Harvard defense held the fort to earn the Crimson the win.\nThe rematch was played a week later and this time Harvard was able to win the game in regulation, shutting down Yale's offense. The win prevented Yale from being able to claim an Intercollegiate championship, with the Eli's having been undefeated against all other collegiate opponents. Because Dartmouth, Harvard and Yale had all defeated one another during the season and with no conference championship to settle the difference, no Eastern champion was named in 1928.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "Several different minor league baseball teams were based in Sherman, Texas, intermittently for a total of 14 seasons between 1895 and 1952. These teams won one championship, shared; that of the Texas Association in 1923.\nThe 14 seasons saw nine different team names used, with only two names used for more than a single season; the Lions (four seasons) and the Twins (three seasons). The 14 seasons were contested in seven different leagues. Baseball Hall of Fame outfielder Ross Youngs played for Sherman in 1916.\nTeams.\nSherman Orphans.\nThe Orphans played only during 1895, as a member of the Class B Texas-Southern League, finishing in fourth place within the eight-team league, with a record of 53–64.\nSherman Students.\nThe Students only played part of the 1896 season, as a member of the Class C Texas-Southern League, compiling a record of 25–27 before disbanding in June. Their spot in the league, and record, were taken over by a team located in Paris, Texas. The league renamed itself as the Texas Association in July, and four of its eight teams (including Paris) folded in early August.\nSherman Cubs.\nThe Cubs played only during 1912, as a member of the Class D Texas–Oklahoma League, finishing in third place within the eight-team league, with a record of 56–37; the team was managed by Jimmie Humphries.\nSherman Hitters.\nThe Hitters played only during 1915, as a member of the Class D Western Association, finishing in third place within the eight-team league, with a record of 70–65; the team was managed by A. L. \"Dad\" Ritter.\nSherman Lions.\nThe Lions played during four seasons: 1913, 1914, 1916, and 1921. They competed in the Class D Texas–Oklahoma League in 1913, 1914, and 1921. They were members of the Class D Western Association in 1916.\nThe 1913 team finished fourth of eight teams, with a record of 68–58, managed by Jimmie Humphries. Ed Appleton of Sherman pitched a no hitter on July 6 against the Denison Blue Sox. Pitcher Ben Tincup led the league with 233 strikeouts. The 1914 team disbanded at the end of July, with a record of 30–75; the team had been led by three different managers. The 1916 team finished seventh of eight teams, with a record of 61–76, led by two different managers. The 1921 team finished last in a six-team league, with a record of 48–78, led by two different managers. Pitcher Sam Gray led the league with 237 strikeouts.\nIn addition to Appleton, Gray, and Tincup, Lions players who appeared in the major leagues include Howard Murphy, Farmer Ray, and Hall of Fame inductee Ross Youngs. \nSherman Browns.\nThe Browns played only during 1917, as a member of the Class D Western Association, finishing in third place within the eight-team league, with a record of 79–73; the team was managed by Leo Hellman. Notable players for the Browns include pitcher Charlie Robertson, who in 1922 would pitch the fifth perfect game in major league history.\nSherman Red Sox.\nThe Red Sox played only during 1922, as a member of the Class D Texas–Oklahoma League, finishing in fifth place within the eight-team league, with a record of 48–60; the team was managed by Grady Higginbotham.\nSherman Snappers.\nThe Snappers played only during 1929, as a member of the Class D Lone Star League, finishing in third place within the four-team league, with a record of 9–9; the team was managed by Red Snapp. The league disbanded in mid-May when the Texarkana Twins folded.\nSherman Twins.\nThe Twins played during 1923, 1946, and 1952 in the Class D Texas Association, Class C East Texas League, and Class D Sooner State League, respectively.\nThe 1923 team won the first half of a split season, with the Austin Rangers winning the second half; the Twins had an overall record of 72–67 for the entire season, third-best in the six-team league. The Twins and Rangers tied a six-game playoff series, three games each. The Twins had two different managers, one being player-manager Otto McIvor, who had played in the major leagues in 1911. Longtime minor league outfielder Tom Pyle of the Twins led the league in batting average (.359), runs (94), and hits (199). Pitcher Murray Richburg led the league in strikeouts with 197.\nThe 1946 team finished fifth in an eight-team league, with a 70–70 record under manager Guy Sturdy, a native of Sherman. The squad had several players who appeared in the major leagues: Larry Drake, Buck Frierson, Pat McLaughlin, Monty Stratton, and John Whitehead. Stratton, who had pitched for the Chicago White Sox during 1934–1938, was notable for having an artificial leg, the result of a hunting accident following the 1938 season.\nThe 1952 team finished fifth in an eight-team league with a record of 72–68. A 6–1 loss to the Shawnee Hawks on the final day of the regular season resulted in Sherman missing the league's four-team postseason by a single game. The Twins were led by player-manager Bennie Warren, who had played six seasons in the major leagues as a catcher.\nNote that another team, also known as the Twins, based jointly in Sherman and nearby Denison, competed from 1947 to 1951 and again in 1953.\nResults by season.\nNotes:"

        "text": "The Purdue Fort Wayne Mastodons men's basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the Purdue Fort Wayne Mastodons men's basketball program in various categories, including points, three-pointers, assists, blocks, rebounds, and steals. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Mastodons represent Purdue University Fort Wayne (PFW) in the NCAA Division I Horizon League.\nPFW began operation on July 1, 2018 following the dissolution of Indiana University – Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW), which had been a joint campus of the Indiana University and Purdue University systems. IPFW's academic programs in health sciences were transferred to the new Indiana University Fort Wayne, with all other academic programs being taken over by PFW. The IPFW athletic program, branded as \"IPFW\" through 2015–16 and \"Fort Wayne\" in 2016–17 and 2017–18, was transferred in its entirety to PFW, adopting the current athletic branding of \"Purdue Fort Wayne\" at that time. The history of PFW men's basketball thus begins with IPFW's first season of intercollegiate competition in 1973–74.\nA significant complication in statistical recording is that the Mastodons have been members of all three current NCAA divisions. IPFW was initially a member of NCAA Division III (coincidentally in the first season in which the NCAA adopted its current three-division alignment). The university moved to Division II effective with the 1982–83 season, and then to Division I starting in 2001–02.\nIn Division II, the NCAA did not officially record assists as a statistic until the 1988–89 season, and blocks and steals until the 1992–93 season (this was several years after the same statistics were recorded in D-I). While several conferences experimented with three-pointers earlier in the 1980s, official NCAA records for three-point shooting start for all divisions with the 1986–87 season, when use of the three-pointer was made mandatory throughout NCAA men's basketball with the distance being uniform throughout the sport.\nPFW's record books for single-game performances only include performances in the program's D-I era, and season and career three-point records date only to the national adoption of the three-pointer. The PFW record books include leaders in all other statistical categories in all seasons, whether or not the NCAA officially recorded those statistics in the relevant seasons. These lists are updated through the Mastodons' loss to Detroit Mercy in the first round of the 2023 Horizon League tournament. Currently active players are indicated in bold; note that PFW is eligible to appear in secondary national tournaments in the 2022–23 season."

        "title": "Divisional Championship (rugby union)",
        "text": "The Divisional Championship was an annual rugby union competition in England that ran over two separate periods between the late 1970s to the mid 1990s, contested by representative teams from four geographical regions of England.\nOriginally launched at a time when there was no formalised league structure for club matches in England, the competition was devised to allow players to gain experience of representative rugby, and concentrate the country's strongest players into a single competitive tournament below international level, thereby providing a better basis for selecting a successful England team.\nThe first version of the championship began during the 1977/78 season, with a brief hiatus in the early 1980s, before it returned in a slightly altered format for the 1985/86 season. The championship ended for a second time during the 1995/96 season as the professional era of rugby union began. All matches were generally played in the December of each season, to prepare players ahead of the start of the Five Nations Championship in the new year.\nHistory.\n1977-1980.\nThe president of the Rugby Football Union (RFU) during the 1976/77 season, former England scrum-half and captain Dickie Jeeps, organised a series of meetings with club and county administrators and persuaded them that a divisional championship involving the country's best players would present a high standard of play to assist selectors in choosing a successful international team.\nThe inaugural tournament took place a year later during the 1977/78 season. The country was divided into four representative areas, North, Midlands, London, and South &amp; South-West, which had previously formed as teams to play mostly against international touring sides, and each division had a national selector acting as chairman of their respective selection committee.\nIn the championship's first final, held on 17 December 1977 at Twickenham, the North beat the Midlands 22-7, while earlier in the day London beat the South &amp; South-West 22-15 in the play-off for third and fourth place. But the championship was short-lived, because in the following two seasons the tournament was cancelled owing to the demands of fixtures against touring teams and only revived again, briefly, for the 1980/81 season before the RFU decided to abolish the concept altogether and return to the traditional 'club, county, country' line of progression.\n1985-1995.\nIn the early 1980s, the RFU instructed its Playing Sub-Committee to produce a report called 'Proposed New Playing Structure to Improve Quality of Play at Representative Level'. It became better known as the Burgess Report after its lead creator, John Burgess, the former Lancashire, North and England coach, and (later) RFU president. The report identified the lack of serious competition as the cause of the England team's underachievement. One of its key recommendations was to re-introduce the concept of a Divisional Championship, but with each division playing each other in a round-robin system to decide the winner.\nSo, after a break of four seasons, the Divisional Championship returned in December of the 1985/86 season and was won for the first time by the Midlands, who claimed victories in all three of their matches.\nIn late 1995, chairman of the RFU's competitions committee, John Jeavons-Fellows, helped create an RFU report that called for the abolition of the Divisional Championship, and on 18 December 1995 the RFU formally announced the end of the tournament with divisional rugby to continue in the form of matches against international touring teams, as it had done prior to the championship's inauguration. \nStructure.\nThe original structure of the competition that covered the 1977/78 and 1980/81 seasons had the four divisions first meet in semi-finals, then a final and a play-off for third and fourth place. During the first season of the competition in 1977, sub-divisional trial matches within the four divisions were also held, and preceded the semi-final stage. During its second inception, beginning in the 1985/86 season, the competition adopted a round-robin format where each divisional team played the other three over successive weekends in November/December, with the team achieving the best record named champion."

During the first season of the competition, there were sub-divisional trial matches held among the four divisions prior to the semi-final stage.\nIn the championship's first final, held on 17 December 1977 at Twickenham, the North beat the Midlands 22-7, while earlier in the day London beat the South &amp; South-West 22–15 in the play-off for third and fourth place.\nResults.\nReport.\nThe four Lions in the North's pack - Beaumont, Cotton, Dixon and Neary - played a large part in their side's success. Additionally Malcolm Young upheld his England status with a lively display at scrum-half and Caplan, who was later to win his first cap, showed his capabilities as an attacking full-back by scoring two tries. The best moment of the match came in the second half when Maxwell, the North centre, burst clean through past Corless from just inside halfway for a superb individual try. Altogether seven of the North team were picked for the first international (of the 1978 Five Nations), against France.\nHorton, the Lancashire fly-half, opened the scoring in the ninth minute with a well-taken dropped goal for the North, to which Hare replied with a mammoth penalty goal from a metre inside his own half for the Midlands. An unconverted try by Caplan, taking an inside pass from Carleton, gave the North a lead of 7–3 at half-time. From then on they forged further ahead with a penalty goal by Young, a second try by Caplan, converted by Young, and Maxwell's splendid try, which Caplan converted from wide out. At 22-3 the match was virtually over, but the Midlands had the last word. From a short penalty, Cooper, Corless and Dodge moved the ball rapidly to Knee, who ran in for an unconverted try near the corner."

On 29 September 2020, New Zealand Cricket confirmed the schedule against the West Indies.\nIt was the first live home cricket coverage for the New Zealand broadcaster Spark Sport, after they won the New Zealand Cricket broadcast rights against the previous broadcasters Sky Sport.\nNew Zealand won the first two T20I matches to take an unassailable lead in the series. The third and final match was abandoned after 2.2 overs of play due to rain, with New Zealand winning the series 2–0. New Zealand won the first Test match by an innings and 134 runs, with their captain Kane Williamson scoring 251 runs in the first innings. New Zealand also won the second Test match to take the series 2–0, and extend their unbeaten run at home in Test cricket to fifteen matches.\nSquads.\nNkrumah Bonner, Joshua Da Silva, Preston McSween, Shayne Moseley, Raymon Reifer and Jayden Seales were also named as reserves for the West Indies' Test squad. On 17 October 2020, Dwayne Bravo suffered an injury during the 2020 Indian Premier League, and was ruled out of the West Indies' squad. Romario Shepherd was named as Bravo's replacement. On 28 October 2020, the squad departed from Barbados for the tour. The squad arrived in New Zealand on 30 October 2020, after a 54-hour journey. In November 2020, Roston Chase was named as the vice-captain of the West Indies' Test side, with Nicholas Pooran retaining his vice-captaincy role for the T20I matches.\nTim Southee was named the captain of New Zealand's T20I squad for the first two matches.

Ahead of the Test series, Devon Conway was added to New Zealand's squad, covering for BJ Watling who suffered a hamstring injury. Watling was later ruled out of the first Test due to his injury, with Tom Blundell named as the team's wicket-keeper for the match.\nAhead of the second Test match, Shane Dowrich and Kemar Roach both left the West Indies' squad due to personal reasons. Joshua Da Silva was added to the squad, as a replacement wicket-keeper for Dowrich. On 10 December 2020, it was announced that Kane Williamson would miss the second Test, due to the birth of his first child, with Tom Latham named as captain of the New Zealand team.\nPractice matches.\nThe West Indies played two practice matches against the New Zealand A team in November in Queenstown.

The rivalry series is between two of the most successful in women's basketball, as the programs have combined for 13 NCAA titles. Stanford and UConn have met seven times in the NCAA tournament, with six of these postseason meetings occurring in the Final Four. As of 2022, UConn leads the series 12–7.\nSeries history.\nAfter Stanford won the first three meetings, UConn grabbed their first victory in the 1995 tournament, blowing out the Cardinal by a score of 87–60 in the national semifinals. UConn would win its following game over Tennessee for their first national championship. \nThe teams would meet thrice more in the postseason before the 2010 tournament with the national title at stake. In San Antonio, UConn downed Stanford 53 to 47 to overcome an 8 point halftime deficit and cap off an undefeated season. The following season, the Cardinal snapped the Huskies' 90-game winning streak, a week after Connecticut had broken the previous record of 88 games by UCLA. The loss was the first by UConn since 2008, when Stanford had beaten the Huskies in the 2008 Final Four. The Huskies returned the favor in 2012, ending the Cardinal's 82-game winning steak at Maples Pavilion in a 1-2 ranked matchup. \nIn 2014, the Cardinal again played spoilers. Stanford defeated the Huskies in overtime to snap UConn's 47-game winning streak. Amber Orrange hit a game-tying 3-pointer in the closing seconds of the second half, sending the game to extra time, and then scored the go-ahead basket in the final two minutes of overtime. The Huskies followed that defeat by reeling off 111 wins in a row, including another victory over the Cardinal in the national semifinals of the 2014 NCAA tournament.\nRival accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs."

In his first two seasons, the team finished with decent records, but as a junior Smith saw the Golden Knights set a program record with 18 wins in 22 games. Unfortunately, St. Lawrence had won the Tri-State League that season, so Clarkson did not receive a bid to the 1955 NCAA Tournament.\nIn his senior season Smith helped Clarkson produce what is recognized as the first undefeated season in NCAA history. Clarkson finished the year with a 23–0 record and was named as an AHCA Second Team All-American. With their unblemished record, the team was offered a bid to the NCAA Tournament but there was a rather sizable condition; because the NCAA limited athletes to just three years of varsity play, the eight four-year players on the team (including Smith) would not be able to participate in the tournament. Head coach Bill Harrison allowed the players decide that if some couldn't play, none of them would play.\nSmith graduated in 1956 and joined the United States men's national ice hockey team for the upcoming World Championships. Due to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 that was violently suppressed by the Soviet Union, both the United States and Canada boycotted the tournament.\nHe was inducted into the Clarkson Athletic Hall of Fame in 2010."

        "title": "Equestrian statue of William Henry Harrison",
        "text": "An equestrian statue of William Henry Harrison stands in Cincinnati's Piatt Park, in the United States. The monumental statue was designed by sculptor Louis Rebisso and was unveiled on Decoration Day, 1896. \nHistory.\nBiography.\nWilliam Henry Harrison was an American military officer and politician. Born into a planter class family in Virginia in 1773, Harrison joined the Regular Army in 1791 and participated in the Northwest Indian War. In 1798, he entered into politics, serving in various positions in the Northwest Territory and later the Indiana Territory. Following military service in the War of 1812, Harrison again returned to politics, serving in various political offices in the newly created state of Ohio. He was elected President of the United States in the 1840 election, but died shortly after his inauguration, becoming the first American president to die in office. Harrison was the first of eight American presidents from Ohio.\nBackground.\nEfforts towards erecting a monumental statue in Cincinnati in honor of Harrison began in 1886 when a commission organized a competition wherein they solicited sculptors to submit their proposals by September 10, 1887. In Winter 1886, the Ohio General Assembly appropriated $25,000 towards this project, with the statue projected to be unveiled in 1888, on the centennial anniversary of the settlement of Marietta, Ohio. By October 1887, sculptor Louis Rebisso's proposal was selected by the commission. Rebisso, a Cincinnati native, was selected over multiple other sculptors, including Moses Jacob Ezekiel of Rome. The design by Rebisso would depict Harrison as an elderly man riding on his favorite horse, making it an equestrian statue. Despite the planned dedication year of 1888, an article published in August 1891 noted that at that time, Rebisso had only completed the model of the statue, which he expected to send to a foundry for casting within the next several months. On May 21, 1892, the statue was cast at the foundry of M. H. Mossman in Chicopee, Massachusetts.\nDedication.\nIn late 1892, the statue was dedicated in Chicago as part of Ohio's exhibition at the World's Columbian Exposition. Ohio Governor William McKinley and President Benjamin Harrison (grandson of William Henry Harrison), among others, gave speeches at the dedication. Following the Columbian Exposition, the statue was later unveiled in Piatt Park in Cincinnati on May 30, 1896 (Decoration Day). According to an article published in \"McClure's Magazine\" in January 1896, the statue had been completed years earlier, but had been kept in storage for several years \"because there was not public interest enough in the matter to meet the cost of setting it up.\" For instance, despite the statue itself having been completed in 1892, it wasn't until 1896 that a contract for the pedestal was arranged, with Legner &amp; Quaing of Cincinnati providing the plinth for the statue. The monument is notable for being the only equestrian statue in the city.\nRelocation and recent controversy.\nWhile the statue was originally located near the park's Vine Street entrance, the statue was moved in 1988 to the Elm Street entrance to the park. This was part of a redevelopment of the park that also saw the slight relocation of the statue of James A. Garfield in the park.\nIn 2020, during nationwide George Floyd protests, protestors called for the removal of the statue, citing Harrison's history as a slaveholder. On June 14, 2020, Cincinnati City Council member Chris Seelbach announced that he would introduce a motion to remove the statue from the park, claiming that the monument is \"pro-slavery\". Two weeks after the removal was proposed, a representative from the Harrison/Symmes Memorial Foundation (which administers the William Henry Harrison Tomb State Memorial and an associated museum in North Bend, Ohio) said they would be willing to pay for the relocation of the statue to their museum in North Bend. \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\" stated that the move would have to be approved by both the city council and the Cincinnati Park Board. As of January 2021, the statue is still in Piatt Park.\nDesign.\nThe monument consists of a bronze equestrian statue of Harrison atop a Barre granite pedestal. The bottom of the base measures by . The phrases \"Ohio's First President\" and \"William Henry Harrison\" are engraved on opposite sides of the pedestal. The base of the statue itself covers an area of approximately by . The pedestal measures tall, while the statue is tall. Harrison is depicted in his military dress, wearing a chapeau and with a sword in hand. In a biography on Harrison, author Gail Collins assumed that the horse was modeled after Whitey, a personal horse owned by Harrison that he had ridden at his inauguration. Notably, the horse is not wearing a saddle, making it unclear what is holding the stirrups in place.\nIn a 1912 publication on the history of Cincinnati, author Charles Frederic Goss referred to the statue as \"very excellent\". However, Florence Cole Quinby's 1913 book \"The Equestrian Monuments of the World\" says that \"the quaint chapeau with a feather gives the work almost a comical appearance.\" \nWhile originally facing east, the statue has faced west since its relocation in 1988."

He played in the NFL from 1920 to 1925, appearing in 47 games and scoring 14 touchdowns.\nEarly years and Wabash College.\nBacon was born in South Bend, Indiana, in 1894. He attended South Bend High School and was described by the \"South Bend Tribune\" as \"the greatest basketball player ever sent out by the local institution.\" He then enrolled at Wabash College where he played college basketball (as a guard), football (as a halfback and fullback), and baseball (as a first baseman) from 1914 to 1916 and was captain of the basketball team. He was also senior class president and rated as \"one of the greatest athletes of the state.\"\nMilitary service.\nWhen the United States entered World War I, Bacon began studying wireless telegraphy and signalling in anticipation of joining the Aviation Corps. He was one of only two young men out of 500 who passed the eight-hour examination for the Aviation Corps. He enlisted in March 1918, and was ordered to report for active duty one week after graduating from Wabash. The war ended before Bacon deployed to Europe.\nProfessional baseball and football.\nPrior to the creation of the National Football League (NFL), he played professional football for the Pine Village Athletic Club in 1917 and the Hammond Clabbys in 1918. He also played professional baseball in the Three-I and Central Leagues, probably in 1917, and with Little Rock in the Southern Association in 1919. \nIn 1919, he joined the Dayton Triangles professional football team. He also worked for the Dayton Engineering Laboratories Co. (Delco) as the head of educational development. When the NFL was formed in 1920, the Triangles were one of the original participants. On October 3, 1920, the Triangles defeated the Columbus Panhandles, 14-0, in the first official NFL game with Bacon as the starting right halfback. Fullback Lou Partlow gained fame for scoring the first NFL touchdown in the third quarter, and Bacon followed in the fourth quarter with the first NFL punt return for a touchdown.\nBacon continued with the club from 1920 to 1925.

        "text": "Ronald James Butlin (August 8, 1925September 24, 2014) was a Canadian ice hockey executive. He was president of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) from 1968 to 1971, when the league separated from the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) due to grievances arising from the National Hockey League (NHL) agreement for the NHL Amateur Draft. He also served as president of the Canadian Hockey Association from 1968 to 1970, which was formed as a national governing body of junior ice hockey in Canada, in opposition to the CAHA. He sought to raise the age limit imposed by the NHL and negotiate better financial terms for the junior teams which developed future professional players. He criticized the CAHA for its spending on administration and wanted hockey policy to be determined by the teams instead of elected officials. He negotiated an agreement to reunite the WCHL with the CAHA in 1970, where the WCHL gained direct representation on the CAHA junior council, better financial return for drafted players, and received development grants from the NHL.\nButlin previously hosted a sports radio show, and was a founding member and later president of the Calgary Booster Club. He founded the Calgary Spurs as an independent senior ice hockey in 1964, which joined the Western Canada Senior Hockey League in 1965. After the Spurs were 1967 Allan Cup finalists, he helped establish a senior league based in Western Canada which included the Canada men's national ice hockey team in its schedule. He sold the Spurs in 1968. After his tenure with the WCHL, he was executive director of Sport Alberta from 1973 to 1977, and directed the first Alberta Summer Games in 1974, and the first Alberta Winter Games in 1976. He then became the manager-director of the BC Games Society which oversaw the BC Summer Games and the BC Winter Games until 1987, and then coordinated the Washington state centennial in 1989. He later spent 21 years organizing the annual Santa Claus parade and the Victoria Day parades in Victoria, British Columbia.\nEarly life and education.\nRonald James Butlin was born on August 8, 1925, in Calgary, Alberta. His grandfather James had participated in the westward march of the North-West Mounted Police in 1874. Butlin studied at the University of Alberta, then became a trustee in bankruptcy, and the owner of a business in Calgary. His company was known as Central Liquidation Limited, and helped him earn a personal fortune.\nButlin was a baseball coach during the 1950s, and was elected vice-president of the Alberta Fastball Association in 1953. He and Arthur Ryan Smith hosted a weekly amateur sports radio show on CFAC, and a hot stove league on broadcasts of the Western Hockey League in the late 1950s. Butlin was a founding member of the Calgary Booster Club, served as its president from 1961 to 1963, and was later made an honorary life director of the club.\nCalgary Spurs and senior hockey.\nButlin founded the Calgary Spurs as an independent senior ice hockey team in 1964, after the Calgary Stampeders team had folded. The Spurs were not part of any league and played an exhibition schedule during the 1964–65 season. The team had an average of 3,000 fans per home game which increased when it joined the Alberta Amateur Hockey Association (AAHA) playoffs. Senior hockey in Alberta was consolidated into the Alberta Senior Hockey League during June 1965. The Spurs were invited to join the newly formed Alberta league, and were also invited to join the Western Canada Senior Hockey League (WCSHL) which was based in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. He considered offers from both leagues, and chose to join the WCSHL. The Spurs finished the 1965–66 WCSHL season in first place, but lost to the Drumheller Miners in the league playoffs.\nButlin brought a professional approach to amateur hockey in Calgary according to The Canadian Press. He divided profits at the end of the season among the players instead of paying salaries, provided medical benefits, assisted in finding day jobs for players in Calgary, and transported the team to distant away games by airplane to avoid time lost at their jobs. The Spurs played home games at the Stampede Corral, and were the only team in the WCSHL to have all home and away games broadcast on the radio. Butlin at one time considered operating a professional hockey team, but discussions did not progress beyond preliminary stages.\nDuring the 1966–67 WCSHL season, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) upheld a protest by the Saskatchewan Amateur Hockey Association (SAHA) that the Spurs had used ineligible players registered after the December 31 deadline. Butlin responded by taking legal action against the AAHA, who according to him had given permission for the signings. The Alberta Supreme Court upheld the original AAHA decision that both players were eligible, but CAHA secretary-manager Gordon Juckes enforced the suspensions since no court order had been issued against the CAHA. The Spurs finished the season in first place, won the T. B. Patton Cup as senior champions of Western Canada, but lost in the 1967 Allan Cup final versus Drummondville Eagles for the national championship. Attendance for the season in Calgary exceeded 100,000 fans.\nIn May 1967, Butlin proposed a major senior hockey league for Western Canada, and expected the higher-level league to begin operation for the 1967–68 season. He invited the Canada men's national ice hockey team based in Winnipeg, and the United States men's national ice hockey team based in from Saint Paul, Minnesota, to play in the league along with teams from Calgary, Edmonton, Saskatoon and Regina. He sought a long-term commitment from the national teams, and wanted to strengthen rosters of the other club teams for balanced competitive play. He proposed for the league to use international ice hockey rules and act as a talent pool for the national teams, and later invited the Finland men's national ice hockey team to play a series of exhibitions games in the proposed league. In June 1967, the league diverged into two separate senior leagues which both kept the WCSHL name.\nButlin offered the Calgary Spurs for sale in August 1967, and intended to accept a position as president of the new league. He acted as spokesperson for the new league, and hoped for multiple European national teams to play games against the league. Later in August, Butlin decided to remain owner of the team. He signed a new ice agreement with the Corral, brought in partners to help operate the team, and switched to player salaries instead of dividing end-of-year profits. Butlin later chose not to accept the league president position, but he felt that Canadian would show interested in the use of international rules of play and three on-ice officials for games.\nButlin sought to hire a full-time general manager for the Spurs when Marv Vangotsinoven resigned in March 1968, after four seasons with the team. In April 1968, the WCSHL was in danger of folding, and Butlin considered joining the Western International Hockey League whose senior teams were based in British Columbia and Washington. Butlin stated he was leaving senior hockey in June 1968, because he felt junior ice hockey had a better future. He reportedly asked for C$12,000 to sell the Spurs, but an agreement was not reached. A separate group of owners submitted a bid to the Alberta Senior Hockey League in July 1968, for a team to be called the Calgary Stampeders that would use free agent players from the Spurs. Butlin later sold the team after operating it for four seasons.\nWestern Canada Hockey League.\nOn June 8, 1968, the Western Canada Junior Hockey League changed its name to the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL), and affiliated with the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA) which was established as a national governing body of junior ice hockey in opposition to the CAHA, and the National Hockey League (NHL) agreement for the NHL Amateur Draft. Butlin was named president of both organizations, and was kept on a retainer and given expenses instead of a salary.\nButlin was opposed to the CAHA structure of elected officials who determined hockey policy but were not connected to a team, and felt that \"teams within the association should be allowed to guide their own destiny\". His main objective for the CHA was to seek better financial return for their teams' efforts, and wanted to see more money given to teams for travel expenses to the Memorial Cup final.\nButlin felt that according to the NHL Amateur Draft agreement with the CAHA, the WCHL should receive the corresponding development payments for its players. The NHL responded that it would not do business with players who had contracts to CHA teams due to potential lawsuits, and had no intention of promoting a relationship with the CHA. Butlin claimed that CHA team had no issue signing players to contracts despite being shunned by the NHL.\nButlin wanted the WCHL to be more involved in the community, and operate clinics for minor ice hockey players, coaches and managers. He felt that a player's education was important, and drafted the league's schedule to minimize the number of days a player would miss from school. He was adamant that changes were needed and wanted to prove to the CAHA that the CHA was doing the right thing. He also claimed that the National Fitness Council wanted a different organization to run junior hockey in Canada, and planned to present a brief to the council for an operational grant.\nButlin looked to expand the CHA eastward, and targeted the Western Ontario Junior Hockey League (WOJHL). He made a 20-minute presentation to the league at a meeting in Sarnia, and convinced five teams from the league to join the CHA. He had also courted the Border Cities Junior Hockey League in Southwestern Ontario. The Canadian Press reported that the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League had met with Butlin, and that he attempted to get the British Columbia Junior Hockey League (BCJHL) to join the CHA.\n1968–69 season.\nButlin continued his verbal attack against the CAHA into the 1968–69 season, whereas the CAHA had mostly ignored him. He stated that the CHA was contemplating expansion into minor ice hockey in addition to junior ice hockey, in an attempt to \"change the hockey pattern in Canada\". He criticized the CAHA for accepting the NHL's lower the age limit that was \"a move to put the kids into the money machine faster\". He felt the NHL should be pressured to pay more money for players it drafted, and that the CAHA wasted too much money on administration that could be spent on its teams.\nThe CAHA refused requests to have WCHL teams to play exhibition games against the Canada men's national ice hockey team. Butlin claimed the decision was discrimination against the WCHL, referred to his league as \"good, clean-cut Canadian kids\" and contested that \"Canada's national team is professional in every respect\". He felt that the $200,000 grant from the Government of Canada towards the national team was a waste of tax payers' money since the team would not win anything, but felt government should have more say into its operation.\nIn October 1968, the CAHA released the disbursement of development payments from the 1968 NHL Amateur Draft. The statement omitted payments for players drafted from the WCHL while the league was under CAHA jurisdiction. The CAHA refused to issue the payments as it considered all teams under the CHA jurisdiction to be defunct. In January 1969, Butlin announced legal action against the CAHA to seek development payments from the NHL, which totaled $13,200.\nTeams in Eastern Canada wanted to test the legality of the contract used by the CHA. Butlin stated that he would take legal action against the Quebec Amateur Hockey Association, the Quebec Junior Hockey League and its team from Sorel, for using two players who were under contract to the Winnipeg Jets. He chose not to test the CHA's contract in court due to differences in civil law in Quebec compared to the rest of Canada. The CHA contract was tested again when the Manitoba Junior Hockey League gave permission for the Dauphin Kings to use Butch Goring, who had been signed by the Winnipeg Jets. Merv Haney also departed the Jets for the Dauphin Kings. Butlin stated that the WCHL would seek a court injunction to prevent both from playing, and that the CHA would seek damages against the Dauphin Kings and the Manitoba Amateur Hockey Association.\nButlin expected the WCHL to expand to British Columbia for the next season, and mentioned that Vancouver was actively scouting for players and he also wanted teams in Victoria and New Westminster. He hoped for at least three teams in each of the provinces in Western Canada, and eventually wanted to see a junior league which spanned across Canada.\nNational championship.\nThe Flin Flon Bombers from the WCHL and the St. Thomas Barons from the WOJHL were the respective league champions, and met in the CHA east-west national final for the Father Athol Murray Trophy. It was arranged as a best-of-four series to begin in St. Thomas, Ontario. The series was the first Canadian national junior ice hockey championship not under the jurisdiction of the CAHA. Butlin also issued a challenge to the CAHA to have the 1969 Memorial Cup champion play against the CHA champion.\nDuring the fourth game of the series played on May 5 at the Whitney Forum in Flin Flon, the Barons refused to continue after an on-ice brawl during the second period. The game was awarded to the Bombers who then led the series 3–1 after four games played. The Barons abandoned the series in the interest of player safety, and departed for St. Thomas despite a scheduled game on May 7 in Flin Flon.\nThe Canadian Press described the Barons as being over-matched in the series and were not up to the calibre of the Bombers of the WCHL. Butlin threatened that CHA would seize the team's assets if the Barons did not play game five, stating that the series cost $10,000 to $12,000 to operate. He later awarded the series to the Bombers and suspended the Barons, and stated any money received from the series would go to cover expenses. Butlin later agreed not to suspend the team and let the WOJHL handle the discipline instead.\n1969–70 season.\nIn May 1969, the CAHA released a restructuring proposal which would implement three separate councils for minor ice hockey, junior ice hockey, and senior ice hockey, to be composed of hockey businessmen and team operators; something which Butlin had demanded. On July 30, Butlin and CAHA president Earl Dawson announced a tentative agreement where the WCHL would rejoin the CAHA. Twenty players from the WCHL were chosen in the 1969 NHL amateur draft which increased the amount of disputed draft payments, with legal action on the 1968 draft money scheduled to appear before the Alberta Supreme Court in August 1969. Butlin denied he was responsible for the rift between the WCHL and the CAHA in the war of words that ensued between him and Dawson. As of September 16, 1969, the agreement had not been approved by the CAHA.\nOn October 4, Butlin stated the WCHL would start its season outside of CAHA jurisdiction, and insisted on a joint meeting with the NHL and the CAHA to discuss WCHL players who signed with NHL teams. He met again with the CAHA to negotiate a settlement, but resumed legal action for the NHL draft payments when talks were unsuccessful. The WCHL and the OHA subsequently began a competition to sign each other's players, in what Butlin described as retaliation due to the OHA declaring war on the WCHL.\nButlin and the WCHL announced a gate receipt sharing plan where larger cities would assist the smaller cities. He attempted to expand the WCHL westward by inviting the Victoria Cougars of the BCJHL to join. Despite his efforts, westward expansion faced skepticism by some team owners in established cities due to the lower calibre of the new teams, and more time away from schooling to travel further. The WOJHL wanted to continue the east-west CHA championship, and felt that its teams were stronger than the previous season. Butlin did not agree to a national final due to last year's incidents, and concerns about the imbalance of talent.\nA meeting on March 9, 1970, between the WCHL and the CAHA to resolve all differences ended after 15 minutes. Butlin reported that the CAHA insisted the WCHL accept the same conditions as other junior leagues under CAHA jurisdiction instead of recognizing WCHL grievances. He later claimed that CAHA executives wanted to renegotiate every detail, and called the meeting \"an absolute farce\".\n1970–71 season.\nButlin claimed that the WCHL was now a $1-million operation and that attendance figures had grown from 429,000 during the 1968–69 season to 530,000 during the 1969–70 season. The league also added the Medicine Hat Tigers as an expansion team and welcomed the Regina Pats who transferred from the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League. He explained that the upcoming WCHL expansion draft was designed that new teams would be competitive in their first year, and allowed established teams to protect only six players before drafting began.\nThe WCHL and CAHA came closer to reuniting in May 1970. The CAHA again discussed restructuring its CAHA committee and proposed splitting junior hockey into two tiers, which Butlin stated was interesting to the WCHL. The Alberta Supreme Court ruled in favour of the WCHL being paid $13,200 in development payments from the CAHA, and stated that the teams qualified for the payments based on the wording of the CAHA-NHL agreement. Butlin considered further court action to receive an additional $40,700 from the 1969 NHL draft.\nOn June 20, 1970, Butlin's contract as WCHL president was extended for an additional two years. The CAHA and the WCHL signed a two-year affiliation agreement on June 24, 1970. The WCHL gained direct representation on the CAHA junior council, and paid a flat registration fee per team rather than a percentage of gate receipts. The WCHL was admitted as a tier-1 league, qualified automatically for the Memorial Cup final, and would receive $100,000 in development grants for the 1970–71 season. The WCHL would be allowed four over-age players in the upcoming season, then reduced to two. The WCHL agreed to abide by the CAHA residency requirements and be limited to transfer six players between branches of the CAHA west of Ontario, and be allowed to select a maximum of two players from a tier-2 team. The WCHL would be expected to abide by any future CAHA-NHL agreements, and the CAHA agreed to distribute outstanding draft money. The WCHL agreed not to expand or relocate teams into other markets without CAHA approval. The CHA was subsequently phased out.\nIn August 1970, Butlin announced an affiliation agreement with the tier-2 BCJHL, where the WCHL would place its top prospect players for training and provide financial support and with scouting expertise. He also looked to negotiate similar agreements with other tier-2 leagues in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.\nButlin and the CAHA had disagreements over roster movements to the WCHL from other leagues in October 1970, and the WCHL was threatened with expulsion from the CAHA. At issue was the number of over-age players in the WCHL, and players who were formerly on OHA teams claimed by an automatic release. The CAHA did not use automatic release provisions in the 1970–71 season, and Butlin was forced to find alternate arrangements to settle disputes between the WCHL and other teams.\nButlin resigned as WCHL president on June 21, 1971, and was unhappy with how some of the team owners did business. He was cautious about expanding in to British Columbia and stated that several team owners did the negotiations without him. He also stated he wanted to get away from hockey, despite reports that he was interested in operating the Vancouver franchise in the WCHL. He felt he would have received a vote of confidence from the league if he had asked, and had one year remaining on his contract.\nOther sports in 1972.\nButlin was chairman of the CFL All-Star Game festival, hosted at McMahon Stadium in Calgary on June 28, 1972.\nIn October 1972, Butlin was in attendance at the final four games played during the Summit Series in Moscow. He recalled that upon his arrival at the airport, \"We were looking for normal customs people. All we could see were soldiers with rifles. It was a dictatorship in those days\". He found the locals in Moscow friendly despite the security presence. During games at the Palace of Sports of the Central Lenin Stadium, Butlin noted that spectators were very quiet and when Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev stood up, all one could hear was the sound of skates on the ice.\nSport Alberta director.\nButlin became the part-time executive director of Sport Alberta by October 1973, and announced that the first Alberta Summer Games would held in Calgary from August 22 to 25, 1974. He was critical of the Canadian Olympic Committee which later announced its Junior Olympics would be in Edmonton from August 10 to 16, after the Alberta Summer Games had already been announced. In May 1974, he was appointed by Peter Lougheed the Premier of Alberta, to become the first full-time executive director of Sport Alberta.\nButlin wanted participation at the summer games by amateur athletes ranging from 13 to 80 years old. He went on a publicity tour giving press conferences to raise interest in the event. The games planned to provide room and board for athletes who lived outside of larger cities to encourage participation from all regions of Alberta, and divisions created for national or international-level amateurs, in addition to a general provincial amateur division. He expected 40,000 athletes to participate, and the games to cost $180,000. The budget included $100,000 paid by the provincial government, with the remainder from private sector contributions and the City of Calgary.\nNo winter games were held in 1975 to avoid competing with 1975 Canada Winter Games in Lethbridge. Butlin selected Red Deer, Alberta as host of the 1975 summer games, and Banff, Alberta as the host location for the first Alberta Winter Games to be held in March 1976.\nButlin announced Medicine Hat as the location for the Alberta Winter Games in 1978, and expected the operating budget to increase to $200,000 for 50,000 athletes. He also hoped for increased private sector donations, due to new regulations allowing larger contributions by companies.\nBritish Columbia games.\nButlin moved from Calgary to Victoria in 1977, and was hired as the manager-director of the newly established BC Games Society, which would oversee the BC Summer Games and the BC Winter Games. He stated that British Columbia was the first Canadian province to attempt to host annual summer and winter games starting in 1978. The provincial government provided $180,000 towards the inaugural summer games, with plans to fund a legacy project up to $70,000 in the host location. He stated that event in the summer games would be chosen according to available facilities. A strike by employees at the College of New Caledonia in Prince George, British Columbia led to Butlin finding other accommodations for athletes at the 1981 BC Winter Games. He made regular practice of declaring each version of the games as \"the best one yet\". He parted ways with the BC Games Society by mutual agreement after his contract expired in 1987.\nWashington state centennial.\nButlin discussed with the State of Washington in late 1986 that he was willing to accept a position to coordinate Winter Games and Summer Games in celebration of the state's centennial in 1989. He left his position in British Columbia when he received a better financial offer from Washington.\nThe Winter Games were hosted primarily in Wenatchee, with some venues in Leavenworth and Chelan. Butlin acknowledged difficulties in raising funds due to it being a first-time event, and competition from other state centennial events for corporate sponsors. He made agreements with KXLY-TV and KIRO-TV to broadcast the games, which led to other corporate interest. Events were chosen which suited existing facilities to reduce costs. The games had a lower profile due to competition from the 1990 Goodwill Games. Additional television broadcasts by KAPP and KVEW, which helped a budget of $341,000 be raised. Butlin expected 1,700 athletes to attend, competing in 23 sports. He referred to the Centennial games as \"a festival of sport, a bringing together of people from all ages and skill levels\".\nButlin sought to raise $341,000 to operate the Summer Games to be generated from corporate sponsors and state taxes. He stated that anticipated sponsorships had not materialized, but the Summer Games could benefit from a $40,000 surplus reported from the Winter Games. The Summer Games were to be held in Spokane, although Butlin resigned before then due to shortfalls in funding and the Summer Games being reduced in size.\nParade organizer in Victoria.\nButlin spent the last 21 years of his life organizing the annual Santa Claus parade and the Victoria Day parade in Victoria, British Columbia. Bill Bennett, the Premier of British Columbia recruited Butlin to organize the events with limited financial resources. Butlin was able to run the events without using a computer, brought local grocery retailer Island Farms on board as a title sponsor. The \"Times Colonist\" credited Butlin for increasing the Christmas parade's popularity when it was converted into a lighted event at nighttime, which he felt would benefit downtown area businesses due to shopping by parade spectators.\nPersonal life and death.\nButlin was friends with NHL president Clarence Campbell, and would get together frequently in the off-season. Butlin was married to Shirley, with whom he had two daughters. He had heart problems and other medical issues later in life. He died on September 24, 2014, at age 89 in Victoria. He had been predeceased by his wife, and a celebration of life was scheduled for October 18, 2014."

        "title": "Włocławek Rowing Society",
        "text": "The Włocławek Rowing Society - a rowing sports club, founded in 1886 in Włocławek. A founding member of the Polish Rowing Societies Association. In the years 1921-1939 it functioned under the name \"Rowing Society in Włocławek\" and in the years 1945-1949 as the \"Rowing Society\".\nHistory.\nThe club was founded on the initiative of the Polish intelligentsia, mainly thanks to the efforts of a lawyer from Włocławek - Bolesław Domaszewicz - and a doctor from Warsaw - Henryk Stankiewicz. Apart from promoting physical culture, it aimed to promote patriotism in partitioned Poland. A Polish reading room functioned in the club's premises, a men's choir \"The Rowing Echo\" also gave concerts. In 1903 a lecture by Henryk Sienkiewicz was organized, who came to Włocławek as an honorary member of the Society.\nIn 1887 Włocławek rowers organized the first local regatta on the Vistula, and fourteen years later they’ve managed to sail the Vistula upstream to Płock.\nIn the beginning, the Society's headquarters were located on Bulwarowa Street. It moved in 1894 to the premises at 77 Łęgska Street. The grand headquarters was not built until 1928 - at 3 Piwna Street, at the mouth of Zgłowiączka to the Vistula.\nDuring World War I, the Society co-founded the local civic guard and established a primary school, many rowers joined the Polish Military Organisation.\nIn the interwar period, the club was enlarged by the women's section, as the Women Rowing Club, founded in 1919, was incorporated. For many years, starting in 1921, Jerzy Zygmunt Bojańczyk was the president of the club, a figure of exceptional merit for the city and local rowing. Bojańczyk himself sponsored the construction of the club's grand headquarters. His competence was highly valued, allowing him to chair the jury at the Olympic Games in Amsterdam (in 1928) and Berlin (in 1936).\nIn 1929 Wiktor Szelągowski, Henryk Grabowski and Tadeusz Gaworski won the first gold medal of the Polish Championship for the club, in the same year they also won the bronze medal of the European Championship. A year later the rowers achieved first place in the international regatta in Antwerp. In the interwar period, the Society was ranked among the ten best clubs of Poland on ten separate occasions.\nThe war did not destroy the spirit of the Włocławek rowing industry, the equipment and buildings also survived. The Rowing Society, which was re-established just after the war, was again successful, it was ranked 4th out of 31 Polish clubs.\nThe communist authorities aimed to end the Society's independence, with its intellectual and elite origins, which finally happened in 1949, two years after Bojanczyk's death, when the organization was incorporated into the \"Związkowiec\" National Sports Division. After the centralization, rowing in Włocławek did not rise until the 1960s, mainly thanks to the involvement of coach Tadeusz Gawrysiak. His pupils (including Bogdan Piątek, Grzegorz Dudziński, Krzysztof Gabryelewicz, Marek Dudziński, Andrzej Peszyński) were awarded numerous national championship medals.\nIn 1987 the club became independent again - it was reactivated as the Włocławek Rowing Society.\nControversy.\nA controversial misunderstanding took place at the club in 2003, concerning the rectification of shares after a sale of a significant part of the real estate at 3 Piwna Street, which had been carried out five years earlier. The misunderstanding had to be clarified by the District Prosecutor's Office and the District Court. The case was being examined by the deputy general prosecutor.\nChanges in the financing arrangements.\nIn the interwar period, members of the Society brought their private property into it, built it with their own money and maintained it by paying high membership fees. There were additional large donations from local entrepreneurs. At the end of the 1930s, Ferdinand Bohma's grain coffee factory joined the sponsors, thanks to that cooperation many young workers started to train in the club. Currently, the financing of the Society functions completely different. A significant part of the prestigious, historic buildings have been sold, the membership fees of the rowers are a margin of income, and the Society's coaches receive a normal salary for their work. The Society remains extensively active, largely thanks to the funding granted by the Municipal Office. The city also took care of the future of the club - a new marina for the rowers was built next to the old buildings.\nCurrent state.\nThe Włocławek Rowing Society trains children and teenagers, the alumni are successful in sports on the national and international arena. Currently, the best and most successful player of the Society is Fabian Barański. In 2019, together with Mirosław Ziętarski, he won the title of European Champion in double scull and the title of World Vice-Champion in quad scull (Szymon Pośnik, Dominik Czaja, Wiktor Chabel).\nThe following members are also considered exepctionally successful: Oliwia Muraska, Magdalena Szprengiel, Piotr Śliwiński, Weronika Klasińska, Wiktoria Klasińska, Julia Gęsicka.\nDuring the celebration of the 120th anniversary (2006), the Włocławek Rowing Society was awarded the gold medal of the Polish Olympic Committee."

        "text": "Herbert Allan Davis (November 12, 1899 – January 9, 1997) was an American football player.\nEarly years.\nDavis was born in Piqua, Ohio, in 1899. He attended Middletown High School in Ohio. \nSt. Xavier.\nDavis declined a contract to play professional baseball for the Detroit Tigers and instead enrolled at St. Xavier College (later renamed Xavier University) of Cincinnati. He played college football as a halfback for St. Xavier from 1920 to 1923. By 1921, he had become known as \"the wonder boy\" of the Xavier football team. The Centre College athletic director called Davis the best all-around halfback that he and Centre's coach had seen. \"The Cincinnati Post\" in 1922 selected Davis as the best of Cincinnati's athletes. As a senior in 1922, he scored 41 of St. Xavier's 87 points.\nWhile at St. Xavier, Davis also played baseball and basketball and was captain of the baseball and basketball teams. \nProfessional football.\nDavis played semi-pro football for Cincinnati's Potter semi-pro team in 1924. He also played professional football at the back and end positions in the National Football League (NFL) for the Columbus Tigers in 1925 and 1926. He appeared in 10 NFL games. And in 1927, he played for the Cincinnati National Guards.\nFamily and later years.\nDavis was married in 1923 to Mary Sander. After his playing career ended, Davis became the first sports announcer for WCKY radio in Cincinnati. He was also the city's recreation superintendent. He retired in 1967 and moved to Florida and then to Virginia. He died in 1997 at age 97 in Lynchburg, Virginia."

The Salukis represent Southern Illinois University Carbondale in the NCAA's Missouri Valley Conference.\nSouthern Illinois began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1913. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Southern Illinois's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Rams represent Colorado State University in the NCAA's Mountain West Conference.\nColorado State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1901. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Colorado State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2022–22 season."

        "title": "2021 Super Rugby season",
        "text": "The 2021 Super Rugby season was the 26th season of Super Rugby, an annual men's international rugby union tournament organised by SANZAAR, involving teams from Australia and New Zealand. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the tournament was wholly regionalised, with the 2021 Super Rugby Aotearoa season and the 2021 Super Rugby AU season replacing the previous 15 side format used from 2018 till 2020. Super Rugby Trans-Tasman followed these tournaments, a crossover competition that featured the five Australian sides playing the five New Zealand sides.\nCompetition format.\nThe five New Zealand sides competed in the 2nd Super Rugby Aotearoa season, while the four Australian sides, plus the addition again of the Western Force, competed in the 2nd Super Rugby AU season. The competition did not feature any South African sides who announced their withdrawal from Super Rugby in September 2020, while the Japanese side, the Sunwolves, was confirmed as leaving the league in March 2019. The Argentinian side, the Jaguares, were also not named in any competition and did not compete in 2021. Following the draw for the 2021 Super Rugby AU season, Rugby Australia confirmed they were working with New Zealand Rugby on a trans-Tasman competition to follow the Super Rugby Aotearoa and Super Rugby AU seasons. On 13 November, this tournament was confirmed as Super Rugby Trans-Tasman, which featured the Australian and New Zealand sides playing each other in 25 crossover matches before a final. All sides played two home matches, and two away matches as well as a 'Super Round' where all matches will be played in one location over the course of one weekend. The final was then held between the top two teams in the combined competition table.\nLaw variations.\nBoth Super Rugby AU and Super Rugby Aotearoa saw law changes again for 2021. Super Rugby AU saw changes to kick-offs and restarts, with a free kick awarded if a kickoff has not taken place 30 seconds following the opposition scoring, a restart is kicked out on the full or if teammates of the kicker are not behind the ball. The free kick will take place at half way. These rules are similar to those that are currently used in Rugby sevens. Also the 'Golden point' law brought in during the 2020 season is tweaked so that full-time will only occur after a try is scored, rather than any form of points. Penalties and drop goals will still count towards the score during extra time, but will not end the game, with play only ending if a try is scored or the 10-minute extra time period ends.\nSuper Rugby Aotearoa saw the introduction of Goal-line drop outs, brought in for when an attacking player is held up or knocks the ball on in goal. When a kick is forced in goal by the defending team then a goal-line drop out will also take place. These rules were used successfully in the Australian 2020 Super Rugby AU season. Extra time was also used again in 2021, again consisting of a 10-minute period, however differing from the 2021 Super Rugby AU season, the team scoring the first points of any kind in this period will win the match. A captain's referral was also brought in for 2021, similar to those used successfully in cricket and tennis, with New Zealand Rugby becoming the first to trial it in rugby union. Each team is allowed one referral per match which can be used in one of three scenarios: a decision occurring in the final five minutes of a match, an offence in the build up to a try being scored or an act of foul play. All other law variations from the 2020 season were again used in both Super Rugby competitions in the 2021 season.\nFuture developments.\nIn the longer term, a new 12-team tournament from 2022 onwards was mooted, with the current four Australian and five New Zealand sides, plus the full time return of the Australian side the Western Force to Super Rugby, following their departure from the competition at the end of the 2017 Super Rugby season. It was suggested they be joined in the competition by teams from the Pacific Islands and Fiji, with South African sides having confirmed their departure from Super Rugby to join an expanded Pro14 competition, and no place for the Argentinian Jaguares either. On 13 November, New Zealand Rugby confirmed Fiji Rugby and Moana Pasifika as its preferred partners for Super Rugby going forward. A Hawaiian side had been mooted to join the competition, with Kanaloa Pasifika having gone through the process to try and join the competition, however they were not selected by New Zealand Rugby. Kanaloa Pasifika launched legal action over this decision, stating that Moana Pasifika had not gone through the correct process to join the competition.\nOn 24 February 2021, the Fiji Rugby Union announced it had completed its business plan for the entry of Fijian Drua to Super Rugby in 2022 and submitted it to the New Zealand Rugby Union. The plan outlines financial targets, initial playing squad and coaching structure as well as outlining the complete administrative structures for the team. The team will be a separate entity from the Fijian Rugby Union, similar to that of the Drua's entry into the Australian National Rugby Championship in 2017. The team is still required to meet stringent financial conditions set by the New Zealand Rugby Union, and so was seeking NZ$10 million in private investment to allow the team to join in 2022. Further steps were announced on both sides joining the competition in March 2021, with New Zealand Rugby Union agreeing to a sharing of broadcasting revenue with both potential sides. On 24 March 2021, World Rugby announced financial, high performance and administrative support for both potential new franchises, in order to boost the performances of Pacific Islands at international level, while also being able to stay local instead of heading overseas.\nOn 14 April 2021, both the Fijian Drua and Moana Pasifika were granted conditional licenses to join Super Rugby in 2022 by the New Zealand Rugby Union. They will join the existing five New Zealand Super Rugby sides, plus the existing four Australian sides along with the Western Force who will return to the competition full-time having taken part in both editions of Super Rugby AU and Super Rugby Trans-Tasman.\nOn 12 July 2021, Moana Pasifika were granted an unconditional licence, confirming them for the 2022 Super Rugby season.\nPlayers.\nSquads.\nThe following 2021 Super Rugby squads have been named. Players listed in \"italics\" denote non-original squad members.\n \nReferees.\nThe following referees were selected to officiate the 2021 Super Rugby season:"

        "text": "The 2021 United States Open Championship was the 121st U.S. Open, the national open golf championship of the United States. It was a 72-hole stroke play tournament that was played June 17–20 on the South Course at Torrey Pines Golf Course in La Jolla, San Diego, California. The South Course previously hosted in 2008, which was won by Tiger Woods in a playoff.\nThe field consisted of 156 players, with 88 gaining their place through automatic exemption criteria and the remaining 68 making it through qualifying, including two alternates. The defending champion was Bryson DeChambeau, who won the 120th U.S. Open, which had been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, at Winged Foot in September 2020.\nJon Rahm made a birdie on each of the final two holes to become the first U.S. Open champion from Spain and win his first major championship. Rahm finished one shot ahead of South African Louis Oosthuizen, who had held a share of the lead going into the final round. Two strokes further back in third place was American Harris English. DeChambeau had moved into the lead midway through the final round, but fell away with two bogeys, a double-bogey and a quadruple-bogey on the back-nine to finish outside the top twenty. During the tournament, Englishman Richard Bland became the oldest player to hold a share of the 36-hole lead in a U.S. Open; he finished tied for 50th place.\nCourse.\nTorrey Pines Golf Course is situated in La Jolla, San Diego and has two 18-hole golf courses, the North Course and the South Course.

Russell Henley led with a 4-under-par round of 67, with Louis Oosthuizen also on 4-under-par with two holes to play. Rafa Cabrera-Bello and Francesco Molinari were a stroke behind after rounds of 68. Defending champion, Bryson DeChambeau, had a round of 73 while PGA champion Phil Mickelson scored 75. Play resumed early on Friday, with Oosthuizen finishing with two pars to join Henley at 4-under-par.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 18, 2021\"\nFirst-round co-leader Russell Henley took the outright lead at six-under after hitting his approach shot to the par-3 8th hole (his 17th) to seven feet and making the putt for birdie. On the par-5 9th, his last of the round, he missed a four-foot putt for par to suffer his first bogey of the round and fall back to five-under following a one-under 70. Richard Bland, making his first U.S. Open appearance in 12 years, made three birdies in a five-hole stretch on his closing nine to also get to six-under before a bogey at the 8th. At the age of 48, Bland became the oldest player to hold a share of the 36-hole lead in U.S. Open history.\nMatthew Wolff, runner-up in 2020, did not make a bogey over his last 16 holes and two-putted for birdie on the par-5 18th after reaching the green in two shots; he shot 68 (−3) and finished the round at four-under for the tournament, tied for third with Louis Oosthuizen and a shot off the lead. Oosthuizen was two-over on his round through 13 holes before birdies on the 14th and 18th to shoot even-par 71.\nBubba Watson did not record a par over his last seven holes, making five birdies and two bogeys for a round of 67 (−4), tied for lowest of the day with Bland, Collin Morikawa, and Mackenzie Hughes. Jon Rahm, less than two weeks after being forced to withdraw from the Memorial Tournament after testing positive for COVID-19, birdied the 18th to complete a one-under round and tie Watson at three-under for the tournament, in a tie for fifth place. Two-time champion Brooks Koepka got to within one shot of the lead after two birdies in his first four holes but made five bogeys the rest of the round to fall back to even-par.\nThe 36-hole cut came at 146 (+4). Notables to miss the cut included past champions Justin Rose and Webb Simpson. Hayden Buckley, who began the round tied for fifth place, shot 11-over 82 to miss the cut by five. None of the nine amateurs made the cut.\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 19, 2021\"\nLouis Oosthuizen made a 51-foot eagle putt on the 18th hole to tie Russell Henley and Mackenzie Hughes for the 54-hole lead at five-under. Hughes made his own 63-foot putt for eagle on the 13th, then holed out from five feet for birdie on 18 to shoot 68 (−3). Hughes became the first Canadian to hold the lead after the third round at the U.S. Open. Henley, co-leader after the first two rounds, holed out from a greenside bunker for birdie on the par-3 11th and saved par from a bunker on the last hole to shoot even-par.\nRory McIlroy made four birdies on the back-nine, including a chip-in from the rough to the right of the green on the 12th, and tied for the lowest round of the day at 67 (−4). He finished at three-under, two shots off the lead. Defending champion Bryson DeChambeau did not make a bogey in a three-under round of 68 to tie McIlroy for fourth place.\nRichard Bland, co-leader with Henley coming into the round, did not make a birdie and shot six-over 77, falling to a tie for 21st place.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, June 20, 2021\"\nSummary.\nJon Rahm birdied both the 17th and 18th holes to win his first U.S. Open title and first career major championship. A shot behind leader Louis Oosthuizen playing the par-4 17th, Rahm hit his approach to 25 feet and made the putt to tie for the lead at five-under. On the par-5 18th, he found a greenside bunker with his second shot, chipped out to 18 feet, and holed the putt to finish at six-under for the tournament. Rahm became the first player since Tom Watson in 1982 to win the U.S. Open with birdies on the final two holes.\nA crowded leaderboard had 10 players within a shot of the lead at one point. Oosthuizen, a co-leader coming in the round, was one-over on his round before making consecutive birdies on holes 9 and 10 to get to six-under and lead by two. He bogeyed the par-3 11th after hitting his approach into the rough to the right of the green, then, on the 17th, drove into a penalty area off the tee and made another bogey. Needing an eagle on the 18th, his third shot from short of the green flew 10 feet past the hole. Oosthuizen settled for his sixth career runner-up finish in a major and second at the U.S. Open.\nDefending champion Bryson DeChambeau took sole possession of the lead after nearly making a hole-in-one on the par-3 eighth. But he then bogeyed both the 11th and 12th before making double-bogey on the par-5 13th and quadruple-bogey eight on the 17th. He played his final nine holes in eight-over to fall to a tie for 26th place. Rory McIlroy, 2011 champion, got into a share of the lead on the front-nine but fell from contention with a double bogey on the 12th after his second shot plugged in the greenside bunker; he finished at one-under, five shots back and in a tie for seventh.\nTwo-time champion Brooks Koepka was four-under on his round and just a shot off the lead after making a 16-foot birdie putt on the 15th but bogeyed two of his final three holes to finish at two-under.\nRussell Henley and Mackenzie Hughes, part of a three-way tie for the lead at the start of the round, both fell outside the top-10. Henley went three-over on the front-nine and made only one birdie in a five-over round of 76 to finish in 13th. Hughes double-bogeyed the 11th after his tee shot got stuck in a tree; he shot 77 (+6) and finished tied for 15th.\nMedia.\nThis was the second consecutive U.S. Open televised by Golf Channel and NBC. In the UK and Ireland, Sky Sports broadcast the event."

        "title": "2020 Italian Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2020 Italian Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 Gran Premio Heineken d'Italia 2020) was a Formula One motor race that was held on 6 September 2020 at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza in Monza, Italy. The race was the eighth round in the 2020 Formula One World Championship.\nThe race was won by Pierre Gasly of AlphaTauri-Honda, who took his first Formula One win and became the first French Formula One driver to win a race since Olivier Panis won the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix. Gasly started the race in tenth, but gained positions due to a well-timed pit-stop prior to a safety car, sent to retrieve the broken car of Kevin Magnussen. Lewis Hamilton, who led the race until this point, was given a penalty for entering the pit lane when it was closed, passing the lead to Gasly, who defended from McLaren's Carlos Sainz Jr. in the closing stages of the race. Racing Point's Lance Stroll completed the podium.\nThis was the first race since the 2012 Hungarian Grand Prix to not have a Red Bull, Mercedes, or Ferrari driver on the podium, the first of those podiums to feature three different teams since the 2012 Canadian Grand Prix and the first to feature a red flag since the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix. It was also the first race not to be won by a driver from Red Bull, Mercedes, or Ferrari since the 2013 Australian Grand Prix. Lance Stroll also scored his first podium since the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix.\nIt was the first instance of there being two standing starts since the 2001 Belgian Grand Prix, following a 2018 change in the regulations to allow for standing restarts after a red flag. This race was the last for both Claire Williams and Frank Williams, as they stepped down from their positions at Williams Racing.\nBackground.\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe opening rounds of the championship were heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Several Grands Prix were cancelled or postponed after the planned opening round in Australia was called off two days before the race was due to take place; prompting the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile to draft a new calendar. However, the Italian Grand Prix was not impacted by this change and kept its original date.\nEntrants.\nThe drivers and teams were the same as the season entry list with no additional stand-in drivers for the race. Roy Nissany drove for Williams in the first practice session, replacing George Russell.\nTyres.\nPirelli brought the C2, C3 and C4 tyres for the race weekend, the second, third, and fourth hardest tyre compounds available.\nRegulation changes.\nPrior to the race, the governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, issued a technical directive banning qualifying-specific engine modes from the Italian Grand Prix onwards. The ban was initially planned for the 2020 Belgian Grand Prix but it was delayed by one race.\nPractice.\nThe first practice session was interrupted briefly when Max Verstappen crashed at the Ascari chicane. The session ended with Valtteri Bottas fastest ahead of Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull driver Alexander Albon third fastest. The second practice session ran without major incidents and concluded with Hamilton fastest, followed by Bottas and Lando Norris of McLaren.\nBottas was again fastest in third practice, followed by Carlos Sainz Jr. of McLaren and his teammate Norris. The session was briefly red flagged after Daniel Ricciardo stopped his Renault R.S.20 due to a mechanical failure.\nQualifying.\nQualifying report.\nLewis Hamilton took pole, 0.069s ahead of Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas. Hamilton's lap time of 1:18.887 is the fastest Formula One lap in history, with an average speed of . It beat the lap record set by Kimi Räikkönen in 2018 by two tenths of a second. The final part of Q1 was marked by numerous cars starting their final flying lap at close distance, hampering each other's performance.\nRace.\nRace report.\nLewis Hamilton successfully retained the lead position on the start, while his teammate Valtteri Bottas gradually dropped to sixth place over the first two laps while reporting problems with his car. Carlos Sainz pulled away quickly to take Valtteri Bottas off the start claiming second. The McLaren driver went on to pull a gap to the cars behind. During lap six the left-rear brake on Sebastian Vettel's SF1000 overheated to the point that the brake assembly caught fire before disintegrating and flying off the car at the start of lap seven. This caused Vettel to miss a couple of corners (in the process he smashed through the polystyrene chicane direction indicator boxes at the first chicane) before limping to the pits to retire.\nOn lap 19, Kevin Magnussen's Haas suffered a power unit failure and his car stranded to the side of the pit lane entrance. At the end of the next lap, Pierre Gasly elected to make his pitstop. The safety car was deployed shortly afterwards and the pit lane was closed to allow marshals to safely remove the stranded Haas from the track. Both Hamilton and Antonio Giovinazzi made a pit stop shortly after the safety car had been deployed despite the pit lane being closed. They were both given 10-second stop-and-go penalties for this infraction (Hamilton was given two penalty points on his FIA Super Licence as a result). When the pit lane was re-opened two laps later, most of the field entered to make their pit stop. This allowed Gasly to move into third place behind Hamilton and Lance Stroll, the only driver who did not stop.\nThe safety car was withdrawn at the end of the next lap, allowing normal race conditions to resume on lap 23. Hamilton held on to the lead ahead of Stroll and Gasly. Charles Leclerc crashed heavily after the restart in the Parabolica corner as the car lost its rear end, entered the gravel trap and collided with the barrier, significantly damaging the tyre barriers and his car in the process. Leclerc experienced some pain in his back following the incident, but a medical examination showed he did not have any injuries. The safety car was deployed initially, but the red flags were brought out shortly afterwards to suspend the race to allow repairs to be made to the tyre barriers.\nThe race resumed later with a standing restart on lap 28. Stroll went wide at turn four dropping to fifth place in the process, with Gasly inheriting second place. Hamilton served his stop-and-go penalty at the end of the lap while Giovinazzi served his one lap later dropping them to the back of the field. This allowed Gasly to take the lead of the race ahead of Kimi Räikkönen and Carlos Sainz Jr. Over the next 25 laps Gasly held off Räikkönen, who gradually fell back to an eventual 13th-place finish, and Sainz to secure victory. Stroll meanwhile fought back to third place to complete the podium.\nGasly took his first Formula One victory and gave AlphaTauri their first win as a constructor and second win as a team, over 12 years since Vettel won the 2008 Italian Grand Prix when the team was known as Toro Rosso. Gasly's victory was the first for a French driver in Formula One since Olivier Panis at the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix, and the 80th F1 World Championship race win for a French driver overall. The win also made Honda the first engine manufacturer to win with two different teams in the sport's V6 turbo-hybrid era.\nThe result marked the first time that Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull all failed to score a podium finish since the 2012 Hungarian Grand Prix. It was also the first time since Räikkönen won the 2013 Australian Grand Prix driving for Lotus F1 that the race winner did not drive for Ferrari, Mercedes or Red Bull. The race contributed to discussions over potential future changes to Formula One race weekend formats.\nAs Claire and Frank Williams ceased their involvement with the Williams team after this Grand Prix, tributes were paid to the pair from around the paddock, including from George Russell and Nicholas Latifi, the Williams drivers, as they crossed the line."

        "text": "Scott Forbes is an American baseball coach and former player, who is the current head baseball coach of the North Carolina Tar Heels. He played college baseball at Middle Georgia College before transferring in 1994 to North Carolina Wesleyan College where he played for head coach Mike Fox from 1995 to 1997.\nCoaching career.\nIn 1999, Forbes followed Fox to Fox's alma mater, North Carolina, to become an assistant coach. He left Chapel Hill to become an assistant coach for the Winthrop Eagles on August 27, 2002. He returned to UNC in 2006, and remained an assistant under Fox for the next 14 years.\nNorth Carolina Head Coach.\nOn August 7, 2020, Fox retired as the head baseball coach of the Tar Heels, and Forbes was named his successor. Forbes' tenure as the Tar Heels head coach got off to a hot start, going 6–0 before suffering their first loss to the Virginia Cavaliers on February 28, 2021. On April 12, against rival Duke, Forbes' Tar Heels routed the Blue Devils by scoring 21 runs, the most in a game since a win against Virginia Tech in 2013. The Tar Heels ended the season 28–27, finishing tied for third in the ACC Coastal Division. The team made it to the Lubbock Regional of the NCAA tournament (hosted by Texas Tech University) where they upset UCLA before ultimately being eliminated in the double-elimination bracket.\nIn his second season, Forbes' Tar Heels got off to another scorching start, compiling a record of 16–2 in the non-conference portion of the schedule. The Tar Heels soared as high as No. 6 nationally in some polls thanks to their hot hitting and strong pitching to start the year. Centerfielder Vance Honeycutt, the Tar Heels' freshman phenom, excelled early, hitting two home runs in his collegiate debut. However, the Tar Heels began to falter once ACC conference play began in the middle stretch of the season. Despite sweeping Pittsburgh and winning the next series against rivals Duke, the Tar Heels would lose their next five conference series, culminating in a sweep by-then-11th ranked Virginia. The month of May saw a dramatic upswing in the Tar Heels' fortunes, and put Forbes' team back in the hunt for a potential NCAA tournament bid. \nAfter the Virginia sweep, the Tar Heels won 15 out of their next 17 games, including four straight wins in Charlotte in the ACC Tournament, leaving the Queen City with the ACC Championship and a legitimate chance to host an NCAA tournament regional. The Tar Heels beat rivals NC State 9–5 in the championship game to win the crown. The Tar Heels did earn a regional hosting bid, being selected as the No. 10 national seed. The Chapel Hill regional was paired up with the Stillwater Regional and No. 7 national seed Oklahoma State. In the winners' bracket game against VCU, Forbes was ejected and subsequently suspended for two games for arguing a controversial infield fly rule call. While the Heels lost the game, they won three straight games including back-to-back games against VCU. They faced Arkansas in the Chapel Hill super regional where they were swept in two games.\nPersonal life.\nForbes is married to the former Mandy Passwaters. They have two daughters, one of whom played volleyball at UNC Wilmington. Forbes is a Christian."

        "text": "Ken Owens (born May 3, 1959) is an American basketball coach and former player. He is known for his college basketball career at the University of Idaho, and was the Big Sky Conference Player of the Year in 1982. Owens is currently an assistant coach for Columbia Basin College in Pasco, Washington.\nEarly life and education.\nBorn and raised in New York City, Owens attended Manhattan Vocational and Technical High School, then went west to Treasure Valley Community College (TVCC) in eastern Oregon, where he was recruited by former Idaho assistant Dale James. \nUniversity of Idaho.\nThis connection paid off for Vandals' head coach Don Monson as he recruited the point guard to complete his college career on the Palouse at Idaho.\nOwens moved into the Idaho starting lineup immediately, succeeding conference player of the year Don Newman. He helped lead the Vandals to their first regular season title, averaging 13.5 points and 3.8 assists per game and earning second-team all-conference honors. At the close of the 1980–81 season, Owens led the team to a Big Sky tournament championship and the program's first NCAA tournament berth. He scored 18 points in the championship game against Montana and was named tournament MVP. Seventh-seeded in the West region, the Vandals lost in overtime by a point and ended the season at 25–4.\nThe following season, Idaho returned the bulk of its perimeter attack with Owens, 1981 Big Sky Player of the Year Brian Kellerman, and senior forward Gordon Herbert, who returned after a medical redshirt year. The Vandals opened with sixteen victories, including wins over four Pacific-10 Conference opponents. An early highlight of the season was winning the Far West Classic in Portland in late December, defeating Iowa State, Oregon State, and Oregon. Owens led the way, scoring 32 points in the championship game and taking tournament MVP honors. The fast start helped the Vandals to rise to eighth in the AP poll before falling at Montana on a last-second shot in January. This was their sole conference loss, and only one of two in a 24–2 regular season; they won their last eight games and climbed to sixth in both major polls. Owens capped the regular season by winning Big Sky Player of the Year honors, averaging 14.5 points and 4.0 assists. \nIdaho again hosted and won the conference tournament, and Owens repeated as tourney MVP. Ranked eighth in both polls, they entered the 48-team NCAA tournament as the West region's third seed, with a first-round bye. After an overtime win in the second round over Iowa at neighboring Pullman, the Vandals advanced to the Sweet 16, but fell in a rematch to fourth-ranked Oregon State, the West's second seed, and ended at 27–3, which remains the program's best season.\nOwens has received several accolades for his two seasons at Idaho, the best ever () for Vandal basketball. In 1988, he was named to the Big Sky Conference's all-time team, named for the league's 25th anniversary. In 2012, he was inducted into the University of Idaho's athletics Hall of Fame.\nLater playing career and coaching.\nFollowing the close of his college career, Owens was selected in the fourth round (88th overall) of the 1982 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics, but did not make the team. After a failed tryout with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League, he signed with Athletes in Action Canada, and played exhibitions against a number of U.S. and Canadian colleges. In 1987, he turned to coaching, accepting an assistant coach position at Columbia Basin College in Pasco, where he has remained for over thirty years."

Harvard, the leading program at the time, elected to only keep its arrangement with Princeton and Yale. As a result, plans for the league were changed to allow Harvard to participate; instead of a conference, the league would operate in a more informal manner that would facilitate scheduling between teams as well as to certify rules that all members could accept. With those modifications, Penn was able to join the Intercollegiate Ice Hockey Association of America with five of its contemporaries, but membership was not the stabilizing force that Penn hoped it would be.\nPenn had originally hoped to schedule a practice game before the winter break but no arrangement could be finalized. After Christmas the team was supposed to open the season on the 7th and 8 January, but both games were cancelled due to scheduling conflicts. In the end they were able to rope the St. Nicholas Hockey Club into a game on the 8th before playing their first intercollegiate game the following week.\nIn February Harvard finally accepted the inevitable and agreed to play 6-on-6 hockey beginning the following year. As a result the expectation was that the Intercollegiate league that had just been formed would become a fully-formed conference in the near future. The news came amidst a good streak for the Quakers with the team going 3–0–1 and looking like they would have a chance to earn a split with Princeton, but the Tigers, who were using the Philadelphia Ice Palace as their home rink, shut down the Penn offense and won the game 2–0.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Eagles represent Coppin State University in the NCAA's Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference.\nCoppin State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1964. The NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Coppin State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

After beginning with a win over the Yankee Division Club team, BC dropped a three overtime game to Massachusetts Agricultural College, one of the top second-tier schools. Ten days later the team lost again, this time to MIT after the rematch with MAC had to be scrubbed.\nThe losses lit a fire under the players who ran roughshod over their next three opponents, posting three consecutive shutouts.

        "text": "The Minnesota–North Dakota ice hockey rivalry is an intercollegiate ice hockey rivalry between the Minnesota Golden Gophers and North Dakota Fighting Hawks. The rivalry is between two of the most successful programs in the sport, as the teams have combined for 13 national titles and 45 Frozen Four appearances in the NCAA tournament. Minnesota has met North Dakota five times in the national tournament, holding a narrow 3–2 advantage. The teams have played 298 official games through the 2023-24 season, with Minnesota leading 145–137–16.\nAfter the 2012–13 season, Minnesota moved to the newly-created Big Ten Conference, which began to sponsor ice hockey for the first time. Conference affiliation compelled the Gophers to leave the historic Western Collegiate Hockey Association, which the Gophers and Fighting Sioux had competed in together for 47 years. As a consequence of the move, the two would not play each other for two consecutive regular seasons, ending a run of 66 consecutive years of regular-season meetings, through they would meet in the 2014 Frozen Four. After the two year hiatus, the programs have scheduled non-conference matchups to preserve the rivalry, though the series no longer consists of the four game slate that constituted the old conference schedule. Nonetheless, the two programs continue to consider each other to be their most heated foe. The non-conference meetings are scheduled to pause for the 2024-25 season with plans to resume the following season.\nSeries history.\nThe series dates back to 1948, though Minnesota counts 1930s games against North Dakota before it became a varsity program in the official standings. Early folklore concerns partisans of the Fighting Sioux throwing dead Gophers onto the ice.\nMinnesota topped the Fighting Sioux in overtime in the national championship of the 1979 NCAA tournament, the first national postseason meeting between the two programs. In Detroit, the Gophers would down the Sioux in coach Herb Brooks's last game for Minnesota. Eight Gophers played the following year for Brooks as part of the Miracle on Ice team representing the United States in the 1980 Winter Olympics.\nIn 2005, the programs would meet in the Frozen Four for the second time. North Dakota raced to a 4–0 lead and held on despite two late goals from the Gophers. The win propelled North Dakota to the national championship, in which they lost to the Denver Pioneers.\nAfter the Gophers had left the WCHA and catalyzed widespread conference realignment, the teams missed facing each other in the 2013–14 season. However, they met in the postseason, in the 2014 Frozen Four. Tied at 1 goal apiece, Justin Holl scored with 0.6 seconds left in the final period to secure a miracle win for the Gophers, as they advanced to the NCAA title game.\nRival accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs."

The ODI series formed part of the inaugural 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League. In April 2022, Zimbabwe Cricket confirmed the fixtures for the tour. The following month, the tour itinerary was changed slightly, bringing the matches forward by one week and reducing the number of T20Is from five to three.\nAfghanistan won the opening ODI match by 60 runs. Afghanistan also won the second ODI, with an unbeaten century from Ibrahim Zadran, to take an unassailable lead in the three-match series. Afghanistan won the third and final ODI by four wickets to win the series 3–0. In the T20I series, Afghanistan won the first match by six wickets, and the second T20I match by 21 runs to win the series with a match to spare. Afghanistan won the final match of the tour by 35 runs to win the T20I series 3–0.\nBackground.\nAfghanistan were originally scheduled to tour Zimbabwe in July and August 2020 to play five Twenty20 International (T20I) matches, subject to lockdown restrictions being lifted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tour was not part of the Future Tours Programme. In June 2020, the Zimbabwe cricket team resumed their training, after passing COVID-19 tests. On 20 July 2020, Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) requested clearance from the government for the tour to go ahead, with a spokesperson from ZC stating that Afghanistan were still committed to touring. However, on 8 August 2020, the tour was called off, following an increase of COVID-19 cases in Zimbabwe.\nA revised tour was scheduled to take place in February 2022. However, in January 2022, both cricket boards agreed to postpone the tour after Zimbabwe Cricket could not secure all the broadcasting services including the Decision Review System. Despite the second postponement, both cricket boards were working to reschedule the matches as soon as possible. In April 2022, the rescheduled dates for the tour were confirmed.\nSquads.\nAfghanistan also named Noor Ahmad and Nijat Masood as reserves in their ODI squad, and Zahir Khan and Sayed Shirzad as reserves in their T20I squad."

        "text": "Peterhead Golf Club, in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, was founded in 1841, making it, by its own claim, the 18th-oldest golf club in the world. Located on the River Ugie near its mouth with the North Sea, it began in its current Craigewan Links home, which is just over a mile northwest of Peterhead town centre, as a nine-hole course in 1892, designed by dual winner of The Open Championship Willie Park, Jr. Known colloquially as the \"Old Course\", it was extended to eighteen holes in 1908. A second eighteen-hole course was established in 1923; however, due to the intervention of World War II, it became neglected about twenty years later and today exists as the nine-hole \"New Course\".\nToday's 18-hole course is par 70 and 6,147 yards. Members and guests who arrive at the club by car park their vehicles on the southern side of the River Ugie on Golf Road, itself off Riverside Drive, Blackhouse Terrace or Ugie Road, depending on the direction of approach. A pedestrian bridge, around in length, takes them to the dunes on the course side of the river. From there it is about a walk due north to the club house.\nHistory.\nFor about 25 years after the move to Craigewan Links, the only access across the River Ugie to the golf course was by ferry-boat.\nIn 1894, a dispute began between the club and the landowner on the town side of the river, Colonel Ferguson. He wanted to have control of the ferry and to employ his own ferry-man. Ferguson threatened to withdraw permission for the club to use the golf course, even destroying one of its greens with a plough. A compromise was finally reached, however.\nThe original clubhouse burned down in the early 1890s. Its replacement, built at the cost of £200, was opened in 1897.\nIn 1905, a discussion took place regarding the possibility of extending the course along the riverside in the opposite direction. The following year, an agreement was made to purchase part of the adjacent St Fergus Links. By 1908 the course had been extended to eighteen holes.\nThe ferry lasted until 1925, when a pedestrian bridge (the George Birnie Memorial Bridge) was built across the river. The bridge was replaced again in 1990.\nIn 1926, a shelter and tea-room were erected near the 16th green. The following year, an extension to the clubhouse was approved, as well as a shop and a workshop for the green keeper.\nIn 1969, a new clubhouse was opened. It was expanded nine years later, and rebuilt in 1996."

        "text": "The Wagner Seahawks men's basketball statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the Wagner Seahawks men's basketball program in various categories, including points, assists, blocks, rebounds, and steals. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Seahawks represent Wagner College in the NCAA's Northeast Conference.\nWagner began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1920. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Wagner's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

The rivalry series is between the two major college athletics programs in the state of Wisconsin and is known as the \"I-94 Rivalry\", given the 78 miles along the highway separating the two schools. The game was ranked the 16th-best among college basketball programs in 2013 and 13th in 2020. The series is the second most-played for the Golden Eagles, only trailing its series with DePaul. In turn, Marquette is Wisconsin's most-played non-conference opponent. Marquette and Wisconsin have met 130 times and has been played annually since 1958. As of 2023, the series is led by Wisconsin, which holds a 71–59 advantage. Since the 1949–50 season, the total point differential has only been 48, signifying the relative competitiveness of the series. Both programs are in the top-50 for all-time Division I basketball victories.\nSeries history.\nUnder head coach Al McGuire, Marquette dominated the 1970s as the program became a national powerhouse, including a series-record 15 straight victories from 1969 to 1978 that inflamed tensions to their then-high. During the stretch, Marquette was ranked in the Top 12 for all but one year, while the Badgers entered unranked each season. One of the most memorable games occurred in 1974, as the Golden Eagles' Maurice Lucas hit a 20-foot jumpshot as time expired to lift Marquette to a 59–58 victory. In celebration, McGuire jumped onto the scorer's table and raised his fists as Badgers coach John Powless walks away dejectedly. The moment was captured in a famous photograph by Robert \"Buck\" Miller.\nWisconsin finally snapped the streak in 1978 after McGuire retired, flipping the narrative on the series after a 65 to 52 victory. Coming into the game, Marquette had won 25 of the last 40 matchups; since, the Badgers have compiled a 25–19 record. In the most recent meeting, Wisconsin beat #3 Marquette 75-64, after scoring first and never giving up the lead.\nRival accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs."

The stadium was originally appointed to host the 2020 UEFA Champions League final, but both this and the 2021 editions, which had been subsequently re-allocated to the Atatürk, were moved due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2023 final was contested by English club Manchester City and Italian club Inter Milan, with the former winning 1–0 via a second-half goal by Rodri, who was named man of the match by UEFA. For Manchester City, this was their first-ever European Cup, and first European trophy since 1970. Having earlier won the Premier league and FA Cup titles, they achieved a unique continental treble. As winners, Manchester City earned the right to play against Sevilla, the winners of the 2022–23 UEFA Europa League, in the 2023 UEFA Super Cup, as well as qualifying for both the 2023 and 2025 FIFA Club World Cups in Saudi Arabia and the United States, respectively.\nReal Madrid were the defending champions, having won a record-extending fourteenth European Cup title in the previous edition, but they were eliminated by eventual champions Manchester City in the semi-finals.\nAssociation team allocation.\nA total of 78 teams from 53 of the 55 UEFA member associations participated in the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League (the exceptions being Russia, who were banned from participating due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Liechtenstein, which did not organise a domestic league). The association ranking based on the UEFA association coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association:\nAssociation ranking.\nFor the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2021 UEFA association coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2016–17 to 2020–21.\nApart from the allocation based on the association coefficients, associations could have additional teams participating in the Champions League, as noted below:\nDistribution.\nThe following is the access list for this season.\nDue to the suspension of Russia for the 2022–23 European season, the following changes to the access list were made:&lt;ref name=\"rus-susp-22/23\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nSince the Champions League title holders (Real Madrid) qualified via their domestic league, the following changes to the access list were made:\nTeams.\nThe labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round:\nThe second qualifying round, third qualifying round and play-off round were divided into Champions Path (CH) and League Path (LP).\n\"CC: 2022 UEFA club coefficients.\"\nNotes\nSchedule.\nThe schedule of the competition was as follows. All matches were played on Tuesdays and Wednesdays apart from the preliminary round final and the final. Scheduled kick-off times starting from the play-off round were 18:45 and 21:00 CEST/CET.\nAs the 2022 FIFA World Cup took place in Qatar between 20 November and 18 December 2022, the group stage commenced in the first week of September 2022 and concluded in the first week of November 2022 to make way for the World Cup.\nThe draws for the qualifying round started at 12:00 CEST/CET and were held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.

This season was the first since the 1995–96 edition in which a Turkish side failed to qualify for the group stage. It was also the first time since the 2007–08 season that two Scottish sides qualified for the group stage.\nKnockout phase.\nIn the knockout phase, teams played against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final.\nStatistics.\nStatistics exclude qualifying rounds and play-off round.\nTeam of the season.\nThe UEFA technical study group selected the following players as the team of the tournament."

        "text": "The 1976 NCAA Division I Basketball Championship Game was the final of the 1976 NCAA Division I basketball tournament and determined the national champion for the 1975–76 season. The game was held at the Spectrum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on March 29, 1976. In a matchup of two Big Ten Conference teams, the Indiana Hoosiers defeated the Michigan Wolverines 86–68 to earn the university's third championship. The Hoosiers' victory concluded the last undefeated season in Division I men's college basketball.\nBackground.\nIndiana Hoosiers.\nThe Hoosiers were coached by Bob Knight, who was in his fifth season with the team. Indiana was coming off of a 1974–75 season in which they had a perfect 18–0 record in Big Ten Conference play and remained undefeated overall until losing in the regional finals of the 1975 NCAA Tournament. Among the players from the 1974–75 team lost to graduation was Steve Green, the Hoosiers' top scorer. However, they retained a veteran core, and the 1975–76 squad had four seniors and one junior included as regular starters. Forward Scott May was the Hoosiers' leading scorer in 1975–76, averaging 23.5 points per game. Center Kent Benson, the team's leading rebounder with 8.8 rebounds, contributed 17.3 points per game, and forward Tom Abernethy averaged 10.0 points. Guard Bob Wilkerson led Indiana with 5.3 assists per game and added 7.8 points, and fellow guard Quinn Buckner posted averages of 8.9 points and 4.2 assists. All five players later competed in the National Basketball Association, as did forward Wayne Radford. Other players on the Hoosiers' roster included guards Bob Bender, Jim Crews, and Jim Wisman, and forward Rich Valavicius.\nIndiana began the season as the number-one ranked team in the country. The team's first game, on November 29, 1975, was against UCLA, the previous season's national champions. By a 20-point margin, the Hoosiers opened with a win. After an 83–59 win over Florida State, the Hoosiers had two consecutive games against top-15 teams. On December 11, against Notre Dame, the Hoosiers withstood a late Fighting Irish rally to post a 63–60 victory. Four days later, they were forced into overtime against Kentucky before winning by nine points, 77–68. After four wins by margins of over 20 points, the Hoosiers faced 17th-ranked St. John's at Madison Square Garden, winning 76–69. Entering the beginning of the Big Ten schedule, Indiana's record stood at 9–0.\nThe Hoosiers' first Big Ten game was on January 3, 1976, at Ohio State. By a 68–66 score, they improved to 10–0 on the season. After a 17-point win over Northwestern, they played on the road against 19th-ranked Michigan, in a game they won 80–74. Two double-digit victories followed, before a four-point win against Purdue. Having improved to 18–0 with three further wins, Indiana again faced Michigan, and the Wolverines took them to overtime before the Hoosiers managed a five-point triumph. During the rest of the regular season, the Hoosiers' only game with a margin of less than 10 points was their second meeting with Purdue, who lost to Indiana 74–71. The Hoosiers maintained their number-one ranking throughout the season, and entered the NCAA Tournament with a perfect 27–0 record.\nIn the first round of the NCAA Tournament, Indiana again faced St. John's, winning by 20 points. Alabama gave the Hoosiers a more competitive game in the regional semifinals, but by a 74–69 margin, the Hoosiers advanced to the regional final, where they defeated Marquette 65–56. That win gave the Hoosiers a spot in the Final Four, where they won 65–51 over UCLA to claim a berth in the national championship game. It was the third title game appearance for Indiana, and its first since 1953.\nMichigan Wolverines.\nJohnny Orr, who was in his eighth season with the team, was Michigan's head coach in 1975–76. The Wolverines reached the 1975 NCAA Tournament, but were eliminated in their first game. Michigan had three future NBA players on its roster. Guard Rickey Green was the team's leading scorer with an average of 19.9 points per game. Forward Phil Hubbard added 15.1 points per game, and led the Wolverines in rebounding with 11.0 per game. Freshman guard Alan Hardy also played in the NBA later in his career. Forwards John Robinson and Wayman Britt, and guard Steve Grote, averaged double-figure points per game. Other players on the Wolverines included centers Tom Bergen and Joel Thompson, and guard Dave Baxter.\nAfter beginning the season with a 90–63 win against Vanderbilt on December 2, the Wolverines lost at eighth-ranked Tennessee by one point, 82–81. Michigan posted five consecutive victories before playing another ranked team, #10 UNLV, who defeated them 108–94 in Las Vegas. The loss left the Wolverines at 6–2 entering their Big Ten schedule. Michigan won its first three Big Ten games, including a 95–72 result against 16th-ranked Minnesota on January 5. The six-point loss to Indiana was the Wolverines' first in conference play, and left the team at 9–3 on the season.\nVictories over Ohio State, Michigan State, and Purdue followed, before a one-point defeat at Illinois. After two further wins, the Wolverines posted their second loss to the Hoosiers. Over the last eight games of the season, they won seven, all but one of which were conference games; only Minnesota defeated them during this stretch. The Wolverines had a 21–6 record prior to the NCAA Tournament, and their 14–4 record in Big Ten games was second-best in the conference.\nThe Wolverines' first opponent in the NCAA Tournament was Wichita State, who lost to Michigan by only one point, 74–73. In another close game in the regional semifinals, the Wolverines advanced over Notre Dame by an 80–76 final score, before they defeated Missouri by seven points to secure a Final Four appearance. In that round, the Wolverines faced Rutgers; like the Hoosiers, the Scarlet Knights entered the round undefeated for the season, with a record of 31–0. However, Michigan jumped out to a 17-point lead by halftime and went on to give Rutgers their first loss, 86–70. The victories by Indiana and Michigan set up an NCAA championship game between teams who were members of the same conference, the first time that had happened. The Wolverines had appeared in one previous NCAA tournament final, losing in 1965 to UCLA.\nGame summary.\nThe contest was held on March 29, 1976, at the Spectrum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The announced crowd was 17,540 fans. A third-place game was held between the two losers of the national semifinals, Rutgers and UCLA. The Bruins won 106–92, as Marques Johnson led all scorers with 30 points.\nIn the first half, the Hoosiers were forced to deal with the absence of starter Wilkerson, who was injured within the first three minutes and taken to a hospital. The Wolverines made 61.5% of their field goal attempts, and entering halftime they held the lead, 35–29. Benson and May helped the Hoosiers gain a foothold early in the second half, combining to score the team's first 10 points. The pair, along with Buckner, were responsible for all but two of the Hoosiers' first 38 points in the half. Indiana tied the score at 39–39; although Michigan did claim a 43–41 lead six minutes into the half, the teams were tied six further times. Britt, who was defending May, found himself in foul trouble and was forced out of the game with four fouls less than four minutes into the second half; he ultimately fouled out, along with Hubbard. With 10:15 remaining in regulation, the teams were tied, 51–51. Twenty seconds later, May scored a basket to put Indiana in front. The Hoosiers scored the next three points; Abernethy contributed two points before Benson added a free throw that made the score 56–51.\nAt the time Hubbard fouled out, there were under eight minutes left and the Hoosiers held a six-point advantage. Fifteen minutes into the second half, Indiana had extended their lead to double digits, 69–59. The Hoosiers were in the midst of a 22–8 scoring run that gave them a comfortable lead of 73–59 inside the last four minutes of regulation. Indiana was able to expand their lead further before the end of the game, wrapping up an 86–68 victory that gave them the national championship and a perfect record for the season. It was the third national title won by the Hoosiers, following triumphs in 1940 and 1953. They became the fourth Division I program to conclude a perfect season with an NCAA Tournament title, and the team's 32 wins tied the 1956–57 North Carolina Tar Heels for the most by an NCAA champion that ended the season unbeaten. The 1975–76 Hoosiers were the seventh men's national champion with a perfect record. As of 2023, they are the last Division I men's basketball team to finish undefeated for an entire season.\nStatistical summary.\nThe Hoosiers converted 32 of their 61 field goal attempts, or 52.5%. May hit 10 of his 17 shots and scored a game-high 26 points while adding eight rebounds; 18 of his points were scored in the second half. Benson had a team-high nine rebounds and 25 points, 15 of which came in the second half. Buckner added 16 points and five steals, while Abernethy also had a double-figure point total, 11. Wisman had six assists, the most by a player on either team.\nMichigan had a lower field goal percentage than Indiana, converting at a 47.4% rate (27 for 57). Green was the top scorer for the Wolverines, posting 18 points on 7–16 shooting. Grote had 12 points and Britt had 11, while Hubbard scored 10 points and had 11 rebounds, the high amount for both teams. Robinson had a team-high five assists and contributed eight points.\nAftermath.\nHaving lost several starters from the 1976 NCAA title game to graduation, the Hoosiers posted a 16–11 record in the 1976–77 season, including an 11–7 mark in Big Ten play, and did not qualify for the 1977 NCAA Tournament. The team returned to the tournament the following season, reaching the regional semifinals before being eliminated. Over the next decade, Knight's Hoosiers won two further national championship games, in 1981 and 1987.\nHaving set a program record with 25 wins in 1975–76, Michigan surpassed its mark the following season, when it had a 26–4 record, including 16 wins in 18 Big Ten games. The Wolverines reached the NCAA Tournament, where they were knocked out in the regional finals. After 1977, the team did not return to the tournament until 1985. Michigan would eventually win the national championship in 1989."

        "title": "Nicholas Robertson (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Nicholas Robertson (born September 11, 2001) is an American professional ice hockey left winger for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected 53rd overall by the Maple Leafs in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft. He made his NHL debut with the Maple Leafs during the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs, where he had 1 goal in 4 games. He is the younger brother of Dallas Stars winger Jason Robertson.\nPersonal life.\nRobertson was born on September 11, 2001, in Arcadia, California, to parents Hugh and Mercedes. His mother was born in Manila, Philippines, and moved to North America as a child where she would meet her Michigan-born husband. Robertson began playing minor hockey while living in Southern California before moving to Michigan at eight years old for better hockey opportunities. Prior to the move, his parents owned season tickets to the Los Angeles Kings and he would often go to games with his brothers Jason and Michael. His older sister Brianne is also involved in athletics and is a professional martial artist, specializing in jujitsu. \nPlaying career.\nMajor junior.\nRobertson began his hockey career in Toronto with the AAA minor hockey team Toronto Red Wings in the Greater Toronto Hockey League (GTHL). He recorded 18 goals and 18 assists over 32 games for the 2016–17 season while also playing four games with the North York Rangers of the Ontario Junior Hockey League (OJHL). He received attention from the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) and was eventually drafted 17th overall by the Peterborough Petes in the 2017 OHL Draft. He played with the Petes for three seasons, scoring 55 goals and 31 assists for 86 points in his last year before the OHL season was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. He became the first Pete player to score 50 goals in a season since Jason Dawe and Mike Harding did in 1992–93. As a result of his successful season, Robertson received the CHL Sportsman of the Year Award and was named to the 2019–20 OHL All-Star Team. He was also selected as the Petes' nominee for the Red Tilson Trophy as OHL MVP.\nProfessional.\nRobertson was drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs 53rd overall in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft and signed an entry level contract with the team on September 19, 2019. Upon the cancelation of the 2019–20 OHL season, he returned to Los Angeles where he continued to work out before joining the Leafs for their Return to Play initiative. He participated in the Leafs training camp prior to the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs and made his NHL debut during qualifying rounds of the playoffs against the Columbus Blue Jackets. Upon making his debut, he became the youngest player on all NHL rosters for the Qualifiers and youngest ever in the postseason since April 21, 1996, when Jarome Iginla made his professional debut. A few days later, on August 6, in Game 3 of the Qualifiers versus the Blue Jackets, Robertson beat Blue Jackets goaltender Joonas Korpisalo for his first NHL goal in a 4–3 overtime loss. In doing so, he became the third player in franchise history to record a playoff goal before their 19th birthday, the other two being Jack Hamilton in 1943 and Ted Kennedy (1944). Despite Robertson's good play, the Maple Leafs were eliminated in five games by Columbus.\nIn the following season Robertson began was subjected to a series of long-term injuries, suffering a knee injury in his season debut. In the 2021–22 season, he suffered a broken leg, limiting his playing time with both Toronto and the team's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Toronto Marlies. Robertson began the 2022–23 season with the Marlies, but after scoring two points in two games, he was recalled. Robertson made 15 appearances with the Maple Leafs, registering two goals and five points before suffering a season-ending shoulder injury against the Los Angeles Kings on December 8, 2022 which required surgery.\nRobertson attended the Maple Leafs 2023 training camp, but was assigned to the Marlies to start the 2023–24 season. He was recalled by the Maple Leafs on November 6, 2023, and made his Maple Leafs season debut that night in a 6–5 win over the Tampa Bay Lightning."

        "title": "2013 in American football",
        "text": "This article documents the year 2013 in American football.\nCollege football.\nNCAA Division I FBS.\nThe 2013 NCAA Division I FBS football season began on Thursday, August 31 at 6:00 p.m. EDT, with both the kickoff of a game between North Carolina and South Carolina and a game between Kent State and FCS member Liberty. The Alabama Crimson Tide were voted as the preseason No. 1, receiving 58 of the 60 allotted first-place votes.\nAs part of the 2010–2014 NCAA conference realignment, the Western Athletic Conference discontinued football and the Big East Conference went through a massive change in membership that saw the conference discontinue football and many of the original members rebrand as the American Athletic Conference, which began play in 2013.\nOn September 7, the contest between Michigan and Notre Dame at Michigan Stadium set a new NCAA record for attendance at a college football game, with 115,109 people in attendance. This record would not be broken until the Battle at Bristol in 2016.\nOn November 30, in the Iron Bowl game between Auburn and Alabama at Jordan–Hare Stadium, Alabama attempted a game-winning 57-yard field goal as time expired; however, the kick was short and was returned 109 yards for a walk-off Auburn touchdown, dubbed the \"Kick Six\". This came just two weeks after the so-called \"Prayer at Jordan–Hare\", in which Auburn defeated Georgia after a deep pass on 4th down late in the game was tipped by 3 Georgia defenders and fell into the hands of receiver Ricardo Louis, who then ran into the end zone for what would be the game-winning touchdown.\nUCF and Baylor were named champions of the American Athletic and Big 12 Conferences, respectively, based on their superior conference records. Arkansas State and Louisiana–Lafayette were named co-champions of the Sun Belt, though Louisiana–Lafayette would later vacate this championship along with eight of their nine wins from the season. In the first of the conference championship games to be played, Bowling Green defeated Northern Illinois to win the MAC Championship. Other teams who won their conference championship games included Florida State (ACC), Michigan State (Big Ten), Rice (Conference USA), Fresno State (Mountain West), Stanford (Pac-12), and Auburn (SEC).\nOn December 14, Florida State freshman quarterback Jameis Winston was announced as the winner of the 79th Heisman Trophy, defeating Alabama senior quarterback A. J. McCarron and Northern Illinois senior quarterback Jordan Lynch, who finished second and third, respectively. Winston was the second consecutive freshman to win the award.\nThe bowl game season kicked off with the New Mexico Bowl on December 21, and concluded with the 2014 BCS National Championship Game on January 6. The National Championship, played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, saw the No. 1 Florida State Seminoles defeat the No. 2 Auburn Tigers, 34–31, to win the school's third national championship. This year was the last of the BCS era, as the College Football Playoff system would be introduced the following season.\nNCAA Division I FCS.\nSimilarly to the FBS, the 2013 NCAA Division I FCS football season began on Thursday, August 31 at 6:00 p.m. EDT, as Liberty kicked off against Kent State. The first matchup between two FCS teams began an hour later, with the start of a contest between Robert Morris and Eastern Kentucky at Roy Kidd Stadium. As the back-to-back defending national champions, North Dakota State received the preseason No. 1 ranking, along with 127 of the 134 first-place votes.\nThe 2013 season saw the debuts of two new football programs, Charlotte and Houston Baptist, as well as the fielding of a football team at Mercer for the first time since 1941 and at Stetson for the first time since 1956.\nOn August 31, No. 4 Eastern Washington defeated FBS opponent Oregon State, who was ranked No. 25 in the AP Poll at the time of the game. This marked only the third time that an FCS team had defeated a ranked FBS opponent, after Appalachian State in 2007 (def. No. 5 Michigan) and James Madison in 2010 (def. No. 13 Virginia Tech). Three more Power Five teams were upset by FCS opponents: Kansas State fell to No. 1 North Dakota State the day before the Eastern Washington–Oregon State game, August 30, and later on August 31 Iowa State was defeated by No. 17 Northern Iowa. The fourth and final instance came much later in the season, on November 23, when Georgia Southern upset Florida, extending the Gators' losing streak to six games.\nOn December 16, Eastern Illinois senior quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo was announced as the winner of the 27th Walter Payton Award, the award for the most outstanding player in Division I FCS football.\nThe top eight seeds in the FCS Playoffs were given to, in order, North Dakota State, Eastern Illinois, Eastern Washington, Southeastern Louisiana, Maine, McNeese State, Towson, and Montana. No. 5 Maine, No. 6 McNeese State, and No. 8 Montana were the only three seeded teams to lose in their first playoff game. The national semifinals consisted of No. 1 North Dakota State, No. 3 Eastern Washington, No. 7 Towson, and unseeded New Hampshire. NDSU and Towson won their respective semifinal matchups, and the season ended on January 4, 2014, with the 2014 NCAA Division I Football Championship Game at Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas, which saw No. 1 North Dakota State defeat No. 7 Towson, 35–7, to win their third consecutive national championship.\nNCAA Division II.\nThe 2013 NCAA Division II football season began on August 31, 2013. Defending national champions Valdosta State received the preseason No. 1 ranking for the third time in school history.\nDivision II saw the loss of two programs to the Division I FCS ranks, Abilene Christian and Incarnate Word, but also saw the debuts of two new programs in Alderson Broaddus and Florida Tech.\nOn December 20, Bloomsburg running back Franklyn Quiteh was announced as the winner of the 28th Harlon Hill Trophy, the award for the best player in Division II football.\nThe NCAA Playoffs were divided into four super regions, each of which contained six teams seeded 1–6. Shepherd, Lenoir–Rhyne, Northwest Missouri State, and CSU–Pueblo received the four No. 1 seeds. CSU–Pueblo was upset by No. 4 seed Grand Valley State in its first game, and Shepherd was defeated by No. 3 seed West Chester in its second game; both lower-seeded teams made the semifinals. The 2013 NCAA Division II Football Championship Game, played on December 21 at Braly Municipal Stadium in Florence, Alabama, saw No. 1 seed Northwest Missouri State defeat No. 1 seed Lenoir–Rhyne, 43–28, to win the school's fifth national championship.\nNCAA Division III.\nThe 2013 NCAA Division III football season began on August 31, and the regular season concluded on November 16. The following Saturday, November 23, the playoffs began, with opening round games played at campus sites.\nIn the first round, which consisted of sixteen games, only three home teams lost: Centennial Conference champions Johns Hopkins were defeated by Wesley, Illinois Wesleyan lost to IIAC champions Wartburg, and John Carroll fell to St. John Fisher. St. John Fisher was the only away team to win in the second round, as they upset Liberty League champions Hobart. The third round again saw only one away team prevail, CCIW champions North Central defeated MIAC champions Bethel on the road.\nThis set up the semifinals, which consisted of OAC champions No. 3 Mount Union, CCIW champions No. 5 North Central, WIAC champions No. 1 Wisconsin–Whitewater, and ASC champions No. 2 Mary Hardin–Baylor. In one semifinal, Mount Union defeated North Central at home, 41–40, after a passing touchdown gave the Purple Raiders the lead with just 1:26 left in the game. The other semifinal saw Wisconsin–Whitewater edge Mary Hardin–Baylor on the road, 16–15, despite a scoreless fourth quarter from the Warhawks.\nThis set up the national championship game, played on December 20 at Salem Stadium in Salem, Virginia, between No. 3 Mount Union and No. 1 Wisconsin–Whitewater. Two days prior, on December 18, Mount Union quarterback Kevin Burke was named the winner of the 21st Gagliardi Trophy, the award for the most outstanding player in NCAA Division III football. The championship game, unlike the semifinals, was not a close matchup; the Warhawks defeated the Purple Raiders 52–14 to win the national championship, Wisconsin–Whitewater's fourth.\nNAIA.\nThe 2013 NAIA football season began with the Morningside (IA) Mustangs holding the No. 1 spot in the NAIA Coaches' Poll, despite only receiving four of the thirteen first-place votes, eight of which went to No. 2 Marian (IN). A Marian loss to No. 4 Saint Xavier (IL) on September 7 dropped them to No. 16, and the Knights would drop out of the poll entirely after another loss the following week to Wisconsin–Oshkosh, ranked No. 10 in the NCAA Division III polls. Morningside would retain the No. 1 spot until they lost on November 9 to No. 19 Northwestern (IA) and dropped to No. 5, opening the door for the Cumberlands (KY) Patriots to take the top spot in the November 11 poll. In the final poll before the NAIA Playoffs began, released on November 17, Cumberlands (KY) retained the top spot, followed by No. 2 Grand View (IA), No. 3 Carroll (MT), No. 4 Baker (KS), and No. 5 Morningside (IA).\nThe opening round of the NAIA Championship tournament was played on November 23, with sixteen teams earning tournament berths. No. 8 Benedictine (KS) was the only team to be upset in the first round, as they lost 13–14 at the hands of No. 11 Tabor (KS). No. 5 Morningside provided the only upset of the quarterfinals, as they knocked off No. 4 Baker by a score of 36–28. The semifinals of the tournament saw No. 1 Cumberlands defeat No. 3 Carroll 34–27 in overtime, and No. 2 Grand View dismantle No. 5 Morningside 35–0. This set up a national championship matchup on December 21 at Barron Stadium in Rome, Georgia, between the top-ranked Cumberlands Patriots and the second-ranked Grand View Vikings, both a perfect 13–0 entering the contest. The Vikings jumped out to an early 14–3 lead, and had a 21–17 advantage at halftime. A scoreless third quarter kept the lead with Grand View going into the final quarter. The Vikings extended their lead to 28–17, and Cumberlands responded with six points of their own; however, Grand View scored one final time and the contest finished with the Grand View Vikings improving their record to 14–0 and being crowned national champions, by a score of 35–23, for the first time in school history.\nNFL.\nThe 2013 NFL Draft took place from April 25–27, 2013, at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Central Michigan offensive tackle Eric Fisher was selected first overall by the Kansas City Chiefs, followed by Texas A&amp;M offensive tackle Luke Joeckel (Jacksonville Jaguars), Oregon defensive end Dion Jordan (Miami Dolphins), Oklahoma offensive tackle Lane Johnson (Philadelphia Eagles), and BYU defensive tackle Ezekiel Ansah (Detroit Lions). West Virginia wide receiver Tavon Austin was the first skill player drafted, taken eighth overall by the St. Louis Rams. Other notable selections included Desmond Trufant (22nd, Falcons), DeAndre Hopkins (27th, Texans), Cordarrelle Patterson (29th, Vikings), Zach Ertz (35th, Eagles), Le'Veon Bell (48th, Steelers), Eddie Lacy (61st, Packers), Travis Kelce (63rd, Chiefs), and Tyrann Mathieu (69th, Cardinals), among others. South Carolina tight end Justice Cunningham was selected last by the Indianapolis Colts, making him the 2013 Mr. Irrelevant.\nThe 2013 NFL season commenced with the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, played on August 4 at Fawcett Stadium in Canton, Ohio. In the game, the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Miami Dolphins, 24–20. The preseason schedule, which consisted of 65 games in total (no less than four for each team), concluded on August 29.\nThe regular season began with the NFL Kickoff Game on September 5, between the Denver Broncos and defending Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens at the Sports Authority Field at Mile High in Denver. This game saw the Broncos, led by Peyton Manning's 7 touchdown performance, defeat Baltimore 49–27. Throughout the regular season, three games were played outside the United States: two International Series games were held at Wembley Stadium in London in September, between Minnesota and Pittsburgh, and October, between San Francisco and Jacksonville. In December, a game was played between Buffalo and Atlanta at the Rogers Centre in Toronto.\nAt the conclusion of the regular season, the Denver Broncos (13–3) topped the AFC West and the AFC as a whole, capturing the top AFC seed in the playoffs. The No. 2 seed went to the New England Patriots (12–4), who topped the AFC East. The Cincinnati Bengals and Indianapolis Colts (both 11–5) captured the North and South divisional titles and took the No. 3 and No. 4 seeds, respectively. The Kansas City Chiefs (11–5) and San Diego Chargers (9–7), both from the AFC West, captured the wild card spots and took the No. 5 and No. 6 seeds. The defending Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens finished 8–8 and placed third in the AFC North, failing to make the playoffs.\nIn the NFC, the Seattle Seahawks (13–3) of the NFC West took the conference regular season crown and the top seed. The Carolina Panthers (12–4) topped the South division and took the No. 2 seed, while the Philadelphia Eagles (10–6) took the East division crown and captured the No. 3 seed. The No. 4 seed went to the Green Bay Packers (8–7–1), champions of the NFC North. The NFC's wild card spots went to the San Francisco 49ers (12–4) and the New Orleans Saints (11–5), from the West and South divisions.\nThe playoffs began on January 4, 2014, with two of the four scheduled Wild Card games. A late-game touchdown capping the second-largest comeback in NFL playoffs history propelled the Colts over the Chiefs, 45–44, and a Shayne Graham field goal as time expired sent the Saints past the Eagles on the road, 26–24. The next day saw the other two Wild Card contests, in which the Chargers soundly defeated the Bengals, 27–10, and the 49ers snuck by the Packers, 23–20, by virtue of a Phil Dawson game-winning field goal. The divisional round of the playoffs kicked off on January 11, with a matchup between the NFC's top-seeded Seattle Seahawks and the Wild Card victor New Orleans Saints. The Seahawks' Legion of Boom defense kept New Orleans scoreless until the fourth quarter, and running back Marshawn Lynch found the end zone twice to help Seattle to victory, 23–15. The following AFC game was far less competitive, as running back LeGarrette Blount scored three times before halftime and added a fourth in the final quarter in the Patriots' 43–22 rout of the Colts. On January 12, the divisional round wrapped up with two more games: the NFC's game saw the 49ers upset the Cam Newton-led Panthers, who only managed to find the scoreboard in the second quarter and ultimately fell 10–23. The AFC's contest saw the top-seed Broncos take a 17–0 lead into the fourth quarter against the Chargers, and advance by virtue of a 24–17 victory despite a valiant San Diego comeback.\nThe divisional rounds now complete, the conference championship games were set to be contested on January 19. First up was the AFC title game, between the top-seed Broncos and the No. 2 seed Patriots. Slow starts from both teams meant that the only points on the board after one quarter were from the boot of Matt Prater, though a couple more Denver scores and a field goal from New England put the halftime score at 13–3 Denver. The Broncos extended their lead in the third quarter and took a 17-point advantage into the fourth, where they fended off a potential comeback bid and took home the victory and Super Bowl berth by a final score of 26–16. The NFC Championship followed, played between No. 1 Seattle and No. 5 San Francisco. The 49ers capitalized on a Russell Wilson fumble on the Seahawks' first drive and jumped out to an early 3–0 lead; San Francisco maintained the lead and took a 10–3 advantage into the break. Touchdowns from both teams and a Seattle field goal put the score at 17–13 in favor of the 49ers, but the Seahawks pass just over a minute into the final quarter put Seattle in the lead for the first time. After a field goal extended the Seahawks' lead to 23–17, the 49ers had possession and were seeking to drive to win the game. On a pass into the end zone from Colin Kaepernick to Michael Crabtree, safety Richard Sherman tipped the pass to teammate Malcolm Smith, who caught it for the game-sealing interception. This play was dubbed the \"Immaculate Deflection\", or \"The Tip\", and the game also became notable for Sherman's postgame interview with Erin Andrews.\nThis set up a matchup between the two No. 1 seeds, the Broncos and the Seahawks, in Super Bowl XLVIII, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The game was met with cold weather, with kickoff temperatures measuring in the 50s, though they were expected to be up to 10 or 15 degrees colder. The Broncos entered the game as two-point favorites, but faltered as soon as the first play when a shotgun snap went over Peyton Manning's head and was downed in the end zone for a safety, giving the Seahawks an immediate 2–0 advantage. The Seahawks converted two field goals in addition to the safety in the first quarter, which put the score at 8–0 at the quarter's end. Seattle further extended their lead with a pair of second quarter touchdowns, including a Malcolm Smith pick-six, to make the score 22–0 going into halftime. The situation worsened for the Broncos as the third quarter kicked off, as Seattle's lead extended to 29 by virtue of a Percy Harvin kickoff return for a touchdown. Denver managed to score only once in the game, and the contest ended with the Seahawks winning 43–8 and achieving the largest margin of victory by any underdog in a Super Bowl. This was also the Seahawks' first-ever Super Bowl title.\nOther domestic leagues.\nArena Football League.\nThe 2013 Arena Football League season, the league's twenty-sixth, began on March 23, 2013. The league played with fourteen teams, down from seventeen the year prior, as the Kansas City Command and Georgia Force folded and the Milwaukee Mustangs suspended their operations for the 2013 season. The regular season's last game was played July 27, and the Jacksonville Sharks and Arizona Rattlers finished as the champions of the American and National conferences, respectively. The Philadelphia Soul and Chicago Rush nabbed the No. 2 seed in their respective conferences, and the remaining 3 and 4 spots went to the two remaining teams in each conference with the best record – in the American conference, the Predators and Storm, in the National conference, the Shock and the SaberCats.\nThe playoffs commenced on August 1, with a National conference semifinal between No. 2 Chicago and No. 3 Spokane. The game was held in Spokane, despite being originally scheduled for the higher seed's home venue in Chicago, due to what were described as \"arena conflicts\". Spokane emerged the winner, 67–49. A doubleheader on August 3 saw two teams keep their seasons alive: No. 1 Jacksonville, who defeated No. 4 Tampa Bay by just a touchdown after scoring twice in the game's final eight seconds, and No. 2 Philadelphia, who took down No. 3 Orlando by four points. The final conference semifinal to be played took place on August 4, when No. 1 Arizona defeated No. 4 San Jose by ten.\nOn August 10, the conference championship games were played. The American conference title game saw No. 2 Philadelphia upset No. 1 Jacksonville, thanks to a 75-point offensive performance, and book their spot in ArenaBowl XXVI. Their opponent was determined shortly thereafter, as the National conference championship saw the top-seeded Rattlers outlast the Spokane Shock, setting up a Soul–Rattlers contest for the ArenaBowl. The 26th edition of the ArenaBowl was won by the Arizona Rattlers, led by All-Arena first team quarterback Nick Davila, by a final score of 48–39. This was the team's fourth championship victory.\nIndoor Football League.\nThe 2013 Indoor Football League season began on February 15, 2013, and the regular season came to a close on June 15. The league played with nine teams, down from sixteen the previous year. The Sioux Falls Storm, the defending IFL champions, finished the regular season with a 10–4 record, and finished champions of the United Conference, while the Intense Conference title went to the 10–4 Nebraska Danger. The runners-up from each conference also made the playoffs, meaning that the Colorado Ice and the Cedar Rapids Titans (both 9–5) made the playoffs as well. The Tri-Cities Fever, who made the 2012 United Bowl and finished as the league's runners-up, finished the regular season at 6–8 and failed to make the postseason.\nIn the semifinals, both top seeds prevailed; Nebraska defeated Colorado 55–50, and Sioux Falls beat Cedar Rapids 44–20, to set up a 2013 United Bowl matchup between the two conference champions. In the title game, the Danger, led by league MVP Jameel Sewell at quarterback, fell to the Storm by a slim three point margin, giving Sioux Falls their third consecutive IFL title and their seventh league championship in the team's history, dating back to their four consecutive United Indoor Football championships from 2005–08.\nAmerican Indoor Football.\nThe 2013 American Indoor Football season was the league's eighth. Five teams competed, down from twelve members that competed during the 2012 season. The Cape Fear Heroes and Harrisburg Stampede were the only two teams to return in their same name and location for 2013, with the Virginia Badgers returning as the West Virginia Badgers. Two new teams, the York Capitals and the Washington Eagles, joined the league as well.\nThe Cape Fear Heroes, who finished the 2012 campaign with a perfect 9–0 record and a league championship, returned to dominance, finishing the regular season with a 7–1 mark and the league regular season title. The Harrisburg Stampede finished in a close second, clinching the Wild Card No. 2 seed with a 6–2 record. The final playoff spot went to the York Capitals, who finished 5–3. The Washington Eagles and the West Virginia Badgers both finished the season without a win: the former 0–8 and the latter 0–4, due to their status as a travel-only team. The playoff structure saw the top-seeded Heroes earn an automatic championship game berth, and the Stampede and Capitals play in a Wild Card game to determine who would face the Heroes. The Stampede, led by Offensive Player of the Year quarterback E. J. Nemeth, defeated York 51–41 and advanced to the championship. Harrisburg kept up the good form in the championship game and defeated Cape Fear to win AIF Championship Bowl VI, by a score of 57–42. This was the team's first championship.\nChampions Professional Indoor Football League.\nThe 2013 season was the first of an eventual two for the Champions Professional Indoor Football League. Founded the year prior, the league began its inaugural season on March 9, 2013 with ten teams from throughout the midwestern United States. The winners of the inaugural game, the Wichita Wild, would go on to finish the season with a 10–2 record, as did the Sioux City Bandits and Omaha Beef. The final playoff team was the Salina Bombers, who finished the regular season 9–3. Wichita defeated Omaha, 31–25, and Salina defeated Sioux Falls, 29–26, in the semifinals. The league championship game, dubbed the Champions Bowl, was played on June 22 at Wichita's home arena, Hartman Arena, in Park City, Kansas. In the championship game, the Wild, led by Champions Bowl MVP Rocky Hinds, defeated the Bombers, 47–34, to win the title.\nContinental Indoor Football League.\nThe 2013 Continental Indoor Football League season was the league's eighth. The regular season lasted from February 8 to April 23. The defending champions, the Saginaw Sting, finished the regular season third with a record of 8–2. They were bested by the top-seed Erie Explosion, who took the league regular season championship with a perfect 10–0 record, which included a season-closing 95–0 shutout over the Flint Fury, a semi-pro team. The No. 2 seed was claimed by the Dayton Sharks, who also finished 8–2, and the final playoff spot went to the 7–3 Kentucky Xtreme. Incidentally, the four playoff teams were the only four that finished the season with winning records; the Detroit Thunder and the Port Huron Patriots both finished one game below .500 at 4–6.\nIn the playoffs, the Explosion faced the Extreme and easily advanced to the title game with a 55–6 win, while the No. 3 Sting upset the No. 2 Sharks to return to the championship game by a mere three points, 66–63. This set up a championship matchup between Erie, making their first title game appearance, and Saginaw, defending champions making their third appearance, also having won in 2008. After falling behind early, Saginaw led the contest at halftime, 22–17. Erie started the third quarter with a pair of scores to take the lead, 30–22, but Saginaw answered with two scores of their own to retake the lead. Only with under two minutes to play did Erie retake the lead for the final time, as running back Richard Stokes found the end zone to give Erie the championship, 37–36.\nProfessional Indoor Football League.\nThe 2013 PIFL season, the second in the league's history, began on March 8, 2013. The league played with seven teams, up from six from its inaugural season, with the addition of the Lehigh Valley Steelhawks. On May 25, just fifteen days before the end of the regular season, the Louisiana Swashbucklers declared bankruptcy, citing low ticket sales. Louisiana's home game the next day against Alabama was cancelled, and the Swashbucklers played their last three games, all away, before formally folding.\nThe top spot in the PIFL playoffs went to the Alabama Hammers, who finished 9–2, an improvement from their three-win season in 2012. The Lehigh Valley Steelhawks, the league's newcomers, nabbed the second-place spot with a 7–5 season. The defending champion Richmond Raiders, coming off of a ten-win regular season the year prior, ended the regular season just 7–5 in 2013, capturing the third spot, and the fourth spot also went to a 7–5 team, the Albany Panthers. Louisiana (5–6), Columbus (4–8), and Knoxville (2–10) all missed the playoffs. In the semifinals, the No. 1 Hammers took down No. 4 Albany, 61–46, and No. 3 Richmond pulled the upset over No. 2 Lehigh Valley to book a return to the title game, 44–40. The league championship, dubbed PIFL Cup II, was played on July 8 at the Von Braun Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The Hammers managed to fend off the challenge from the Raiders, and took home the championship, by a score of 70–44.\nLFL US.\nThe 2013 LFL US season was the fifth in the league's history, but the first under the name \"Legends Football League\". Twelve teams competed, split into two conferences (Eastern and Western) each containing two divisions (Southeastern and Northeastern; Midwestern and Pacific). Each team played a four-game regular season, against all but one of the teams in their conference. The regular season began on March 30, with a contest between the Atlanta Steam and the Jacksonville Breeze, and concluded on August 10 with a game between the Chicago Bliss and the Green Bay Chill.\nAt the regular season's conclusion, the Baltimore Charm sat atop the Eastern Conference with a 3–1 record, while the Seattle Mist won the Western Conference title at 4–0. Those two teams automatically qualified for the playoff semifinals, while their opponents were to be decided in the divisional round. The Atlanta Steam and the Philadelphia Passion (both 2–1–1) made the divisional round from the Eastern Conference, while the Chicago Bliss (3–1) and the Los Angeles Temptation (2–1–1) qualified from the Western Conference. The playoffs began on August 17 with the divisional round, which saw Philadelphia beat Atlanta, 28–20, and Chicago defeat Los Angeles, 19–12. Philadelphia and Chicago then advanced to the conference championships, to be played on August 24. In the semifinals, Philadelphia upset Baltimore by a point, and Chicago defeated Seattle by 17, putting the Passion and the Bliss in the championship game, the Legends Cup. The league championship was played on September 1, at Orleans Arena in Paradise, Nevada, and saw Chicago defeat Philadelphia, 38–14, to win the league for the first time in team history.\nUltimate Indoor Football League.\nThe 2013 UIFL season was the third in league history. Six teams contested the 2013 season, down from ten the year prior. The regular season began on March 8, and concluded on June 4 with the defending league runners-up, the Florida Tarpons, leading the league at 5–1 and capturing the first of three available playoff spots. The second spot was won by the Corpus Christi Fury, an expansion team that finished 6–1, and the third went to the Lakeland Raiders, who finished 6–3. The Missouri Monsters (5–5) and the Georgia Rampage (3–5) both missed the playoffs, as did the Sarasota Thunder, who finished the season having only played three games, all of which ended in shutout losses; their other four scheduled games were cancelled.\nThe UIFL's three-team playoff began with the semifinal game on June 2, between the Lakeland Raiders and the Corpus Christi Fury. The Fury defeated the Raiders, 58–48, and advanced to the league championship. The title game, dubbed Ultimate Bowl III, was played on June 8 between the No. 1 Florida Tarpons and the No. 2 Corpus Christi Fury at the Germain Arena at Estero, Florida. The Tarpons won the game, 40–32, to capture their first league championship in team history.\nInternational leagues.\nBelgian Football League.\nThe 2013 BFL season was the twenty-seventh in the history of the league, the top flight American football league in Belgium. Fifteen teams competed, and were divided into two conferences, the Flemish American Football League (FAFL) and the Ligue Francophone de Football Americain de Belgique (LFFAB). The top three seeds in each conference gained playoff berths; those teams were determined upon the conclusion of the regular season. In the FFL, the Brussels Bulls repeated as conference champions, finishing the regular season 6–0. The Brussels Black Angels finished runners-up at 5–1, and the Puurs Titans claimed the final spot with a 3–2 record. In the LFFAB, the BFL's defending champions, the Brussels Tigers (7–0) took the top spot, winning their fourth consecutive conference championship. The Louvain-la-Neuve Fighting Turtles (6–1) and the Liège Monarchs (4–3) also earned playoff berths, as the No. 2 and No. 3 seeds, respectively.\nThe playoffs began with the quarterfinal round on May 12. The FFL's quarterfinal saw the Black Angels defeat the Monarchs, while the LFFAB's quarterfinal finished with a 24–2 win for Louvain-la-Neuve over Puurs. The semifinals took place on May 19; Both top seeds prevailed, with the Brussels Bulls setting up a title defense by virtue of a 50–14 victory of Louvain-la-Neuve, and the Brussels Tigers defeating the Brussels Black Angels 37–7 to book their place in the title game. The league championship, Belgian Bowl XXVI, was played on June 2, in Izegem, between the two conference champions. The Brussels Tigers successfully defended their title, as they defeated the Bulls 9–0.\nGerman Football League.\nThe 2013 German Football League was the competition's thirty-fifth edition. Sixteen teams contested the GFL, the top-flight American football league in Germany, while an additional sixteen contested the second-flight GFL 2. The league's regular season began on May 5 and ran through September 15. At the end of the regular season, the GFL North was led by the New Yorker Lions, while the South was led by the Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns. The top four teams in each conference qualified for the playoffs, meaning that berths from the North also went to the Dresden Monarchs, the Kiel Baltic Hurricanes, and the Berlin Adler, while the South qualified the Marburg Mercenaries, the Munich Cowboys, and the Rhein-Neckar Bandits.\nThe playoffs began on September 21. In the quarterfinal round, all four of the GFL South teams suffered defeats, which guaranteed a title to a GFL North team. New Yorker and Dresden, the top two seeds from the North, advanced past the semifinals and earned berths in the championship game. German Bowl XXXV was held on October 12 at Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in Berlin and saw the Lions defeat the Monarchs, 35–34, to win their thirteenth league title.\nThe GFL operates with a promotion and relegation system, meaning the last-place team from each conference faces the champions of the respective GFL 2 conference to determine who will play in the top flight the following season. In the GFL North relegation playoff, the last-place Cologne Falcons defeated the GFL 2 North champion Bielefield Bulldogs by a single point on aggregate to keep their place in the GFL. The GFL south last-place finishers, the Wiesbaden Phantoms, were defeated by the GFL 2 South champion Allgäu Comets on aggregate, and were therefore relegated.\nLFL Canada.\nThe 2013 LFL Canada season was planned to have been the second season of the Legends Football League in Canada. Four teams were scheduled to contest the season: the BC Angels, the Calgary Fillies, the Regina Rage, and the Saskatoon Sirens. The season was scheduled to begin on September 13, and the regular season was planned to run through November 9, with the top two teams in the league standings automatically qualifying for the LFL Canada Legends Cup on November 16, held at the Stampede Corral in Calgary. Ultimately, the season was never played; three new coaching staffs from the previous season, a short timeframe for teams to prepare, and safety concerns prompted the cancellation of the season."

        "title": "Oxford University Men's Basketball",
        "text": "The Oxford University men's basketball team represents the University of Oxford in the BUCS Basketball League and the National Basketball League (NBL). The team has won 19 National Championships, making it one of the most successful university basketball teams in the United Kingdom. The team is currently coached by Greg Robertson.\nBasketball has a long history at Oxford. The earliest record of basketball being played at the university was in 1893, just two years after the game's invention. The first known men's inter-varsity basketball team was selected in 1921, when it competed against the University of Cambridge in the inaugural Oxford-Cambridge Inter-Varsity Basketball Match. \nThe 1940s.\nIn 1947, Oxford assembled the first team of the post World War II era in response to an invitation from the Czechoslovakian National Team to play ahead of the 1948 Olympic Games. In January 1948, the Blues embarked on an eight-game tour of Czechoslovakia. The Czechoslovakian National Team beat Oxford 58–32 in the tour's opening game, but Oxford finished the trip with a 4–4 record.\nThe first post World War II Varsity Game was held on June 11, 1949, at RAF Halton. Oxford dominated their rivals with a 47–11 victory.\nThe 1950s.\nIn 1950, the A.B.B.A. selected the Oxford men's basketball team to play the London Latter Day Saints in a \"curtain-raiser\" match ahead of a Harlem Globetrotters fixture at the Empire Pool and Sports Arena, Wembley. Oxford's association with the Harlem Globetrotters would continue the following three years when the Oxford-Cambridge Inter-varsity Basketball Match was one of many rivalry games played before the Harlem Globetrotters games during their London tour. Oxford won each of those contests with as many as 10,000 fans in attendance.\nIn 1951, basketball earned the distinction of being a Half-Blue sport at the University of Oxford.\nIn 1956, a team captained by Fred Seigler that included future U.S. Senators Richard Lugar and Paul Sarbanes won the university's first ever A.B.B.A. National Championship.\nThe 1960s.\nIn 1963, the arrival of John Edgar Wideman had a major impact on the upward trajectory of the basketball program. In his first season, Wideman led Oxford to the A.B.B.A. National Championship Semi-Finals where they lost a two-point thriller (74-76) to eventual three-peat national champions London Central YMCA.\nIn 1964–65, Wideman's Blues advanced to the A.B.B.A. National Championship game against the Aldershot Warriors, the British Army team. The Warriors would win the first meeting 79–63, but this was just the beginning of a fierce rivalry between Oxford and the British Army that would last the rest of the decade.\nIn 1965–66, the arrival of NCAA Player of the Year Bill Bradley, having just been drafted by the NBA's New York Knicks, provided a much welcomed boost to an already talented roster. The Oxford Blues won the B.U.S.F. National Championship in December 1965 and, in March 1966, the team went on to win the A.B.B.A. National Championship 91–70 in a rematch against the Aldershot Warriors. Wideman was named A.B.B.A National Championship MVP. In 1966, the Oxford University Blues Committee elevated basketball to Full Blue status.\nIn 1966–67, Oxford University were considered favourites for the A.B.B.A. National Championship and had what Basketball magazine described as \"undoubtedly the finest group of players in the country at present.\" On November 16, 1966, Oxford took on reigning EuroLeague Champions Simmenthal Milan in a game that was broadcast live on BBC. 500 fans packed themselves into Iffley Road Sports Centre to witness one of the most exciting games ever to be played at Oxford. Milan ended up edging Oxford 69–70 in a back-and-forth affair. The Blues retained their B.U.S.F. National Championship, however the team was denied the opportunity to defend their national title when they were disqualified for arriving late to their third-round game against London Central YMCA. According to Bill Bradley, the men's basketball team voted unanimously to forfeit the match in order to hear Robert F. Kennedy speak at the Oxford Union.\nIn 1967–68, Oxford claimed a third consecutive B.U.S.F. National Championship with a 71–37 win against Cambridge University in Birmingham. On March 16, 1968, an enthusiastic crowd of 1,400 fans filled Crystal Palace to watch the A.B.B.A. National Championship game. In a repeat of the 1966 Final, the Oxford Blues beat Aldershot Warriors 61–57. Tom Ward was named A.B.B.A National Championship MVP.\nThe 1970s.\nIn 1970, Oxford University missed out on a third A.B.B.A. national title, losing 67–73 in the championship final against the Liverpool and Bootle Police, led by legendary player-coach Jimmy Rogers. The following season (1970–71), Oxford suffered a shock early exit from the A.B.B.A. National Championship when they lost 65–67 to Manchester University.\nIn 1971–72, the arrival of 1970 NBA draft pick Heyward Dotson would change Oxford's fortunes. Dotson led the Blues to the 1971 B.U.S.F. National Championship, and a combined Oxford and Cambridge side, nicknamed \"Oxbridge,\" to the final of the 1972 A.B.B.A. National Championship.\nIn 1972–73, the Blues maintained their dominance in British university basketball with a fifth B.U.S.F. National Championship.\nThe 1990s.\nWith its large contingent of Americans, the Dark Blues continued to dominate British university basketball throughout the 1990s. In 1989–90, the Blues were runners-up to Loughborough in the B.U.S.F. National Championship. Under captain Rich Kortum, a former Duke University walk-on, they followed this with back-to-back B.U.S.F. National Championships in 1990-91 and 1991–92, defeating Northern Ireland in both finals.\nIn 1992, Oxford also captured the B.S.S.F. (British Students Sports Federation) national title over heavily favoured defending champions Doncaster, 102–69, on the latter's home court. The Dark Blues' Duncan Ruckledge, a former England Under-19 star, was named tournament MVP.\nIn 1992–93, Oxford successfully defended its B.S.S.F national crown against arch-rival Cambridge. That year, Jodi Evans made international headlines as the first woman to represent Oxford University Men's Basketball team in the annual Varsity Match against Cambridge. Evans played 16 minutes and scored 4 points in the 86–64 loss. Evans, a member of the Canadian Women's National Team, had previously been ruled ineligible to play in any B.S.S.F. men's league or tournament games in a controversial decision by the sport's governing body because she was a woman.\nThe Blues won the B.U.S.A. National Championship in 1995.\nOxford's success on the hardwood continued through the late 1990s. In 1997–98, the Blues posted a 25–2 season record and a B.U.S.A. Final Four appearance. Oxford finished the following season in 1998–99 with a 24–1 record, capturing the B.U.S.A. national championship in a 73–61 win over Loughborough University.\nThe 2000s.\nFollowing their 1999 National Championship, Oxford continued their dominance in British university basketball into the new millennium with another four straight trips to the B.U.S.A. Championship Final from 2000 to 2003. The 2000 championship game saw a rematch against Loughborough, which Oxford had beaten the previous year. This time Loughborough were the victors. Oxford regained the title in 2001, but couldn't out match the University of St Mark and St John in the 2002 and 2003 Finals.\nThe 2010s.\nOxford began the 2010s with a pair of B.U.C.S. Premier League South Division titles and consecutive appearances in the B.U.C.S. National Championship Final Four, where they lost to Leeds Metropolitan University in 2010 and Worcester in 2011.\nSince 2011, the Blues have failed to advance further than the B.U.C.S. Super Eights.\nIn 2016, after a close back and forth duel in the annual Varsity Basketball Match, Cambridge beat Oxford by two points, 76–74.\nIn 2018, Oxford went winless (0-10) in the Premier League South and were relegated to B.U.C.S. Midlands League Division One.\nThe team continued to struggle in 2018–19. The Blues finished the season 3–7 in league play, in the bottom two of the league, and were demoted to B.U.C.S. Midlands League Division Two, and in the final Varsity Game of the decade, Oxford lost to Cambridge 69–81.\nIn 2019–20, the Blues had their first winning season in three years with a 7-6 overall record. Th Blues finished in third place in B.U.C.S. Midlands League Division 2B with a 6-4 record and advanced to the second round of the Midlands Conference Cup. Oxford fell short against Cambridge in The Varsity Game with a final score of 65–71.\nThe 2020s.\nThe 2020s have seen a renaissance in basketball at Oxford University. \nOn 5 June 2020, Oxford University hired Great Britain Men's National Team assistant coach Jamie Smith as the new head men's basketball coach. \nDespite the 2020-21 BUCS season being cancelled, the team participated in a meaningful programme of practices and games within Covid-19 restrictions. The Blues finished the season with a 7-3 (.700) record, the highest winning percentage since 2010-11. The Blues beat cross-town rival Oxford Brookes University for the first time since 2008-09. The 87-47 win over Brookes was the largest margin of victory in the 40-year history of the rivalry. \nIn 2021–22, the Blues finished the season with a 23-3 overall record, the most wins since 1998–99, and their first 20+ win season in over two decades. The Blues had a perfect 10–0 record in BUCS league play to be crowned BUCS Midlands 2A champions and earn promotion to tier one. They ended the season as winners of the Oxfordshire Basketball Association Cup for the first time since 1970–71.\nIn July 2022, the Oxford University Blues were invited to join the National Basketball League for the 2022–23 season. This would mark the first time Oxford University had competed in any national league competition since the 1965–66 season when they competed in the Southern Section of the British National Basketball League. This was the first time Oxford University has competed in Basketball England's NBL which was established in 1972. Oxford University began their inaugural National Basketball League campaign with a 3–0 record.\nOn 18 January 2023, Blues captain Josh Soifer scored a career high 58 points in a 117–60 win over Birmingham City University in BUCS league play. In doing so, Soifer broke the Oxford University single game scoring record which had stood for 66-years. The previous record holder was Willie Morris who scored 54 points against the Royal Air Force during the 1956–57 season.\nOn 11 March 2023, Oxford beat Cambridge 84–74 in The Varsity Game. This marked the first time Oxford had beaten Cambridge since 2018.\nThe Blues finished the 2022–23 season with a 26-17 overall record, the second most wins in the programme's 102-year history, and the first time the Blues had recorded back-to-back 20+ winning seasons since the 1997–98 and 1998–99 seasons.\nOn 16 August 2023, it was announced that Smith was stepping down as head men’s basketball coach following the unexpected death of his father and a desire to return to the United States ahead of the 2024-25 season. Smith departed as the winningest coach in Oxford University Men’s Basketball history. \nOn 26 September 2023, Greg Robertson was announced as Oxford University’s new Head Men’s Basketball Coach. Robertson relocated from St. Thomas, Canada to take the position. Despite being far from home, Robertson said the opportunity was a dream scenario and described his hiring as “an absolute honour.” \nThe Blues earned their first win of the Greg Robertson era on November 22, 2023 with an 80-65 victory over City University of London in the first round of the B.U.C.S National Trophy. \nFrom 9 February to 11 February 2024, The Blues competed in Tournoi Les Parisiennes 2024, an international multi-sport student competition. The Basketball tournament consisted of non-regulation 20 minute games played over a group stage and knockout stage. The Blues placed second, beating University College London in the semi-finals before falling to University of Glasgow in the championship game.\nOn 2 March 2024, Cambridge University defeated Oxford University 88-67 in The Varsity Game. The 21-point margin was the largest since 2015 when Cambridge won 91-66.\nOn 6 March 2024, Oxford lost to Loughborough 81-74 in their last league game of the season. The Blues finished the season 0-10 in BUCS league play.\nTraditions &amp; Rivalries.\nOxford University is renowned for its traditions, and its basketball club is no different. In addition to playing in BUCS, National League, and Oxford &amp; District local league competitions, the Blues play a series of marquee fixtures against their longstanding rivals every season.\nThe Varsity Game (University of Cambridge) - Dating back to 1921, The Varsity Game is the oldest basketball competition still played in the United Kingdom, played between Oxford University and Cambridge University.

The Hilltoppers were members of the Ohio Valley Conference and led by future National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame coach Gene Keady in his first year as head coach. WKU finished tied for second in the OVC regular season. The conference tournament was hosted by regular season champion Eastern Kentucky. Western Kentucky had defeated EKU twice during the season, but their third meeting in the conference tournament championship ended in controversy. The Hilltoppers held a one-point lead when the game clock expired, however, due to crowd noise, the referees and time keeper did not hear the buzzer. A foul was called on WKU with no time left and Eastern Kentucky made two free throws to win the game. A review of game film afterwards showed that the foul was called 3.5 seconds after the game clock had ended. Western Kentucky appealed to the OVC Commissioner, however, their appeal was denied. This perceived wrong was a factor in Western Kentucky's decision to leave the OVC in 1982. Greg Jackson and Trey Trumbo were named to the All-OVC Team, and Jackson was OVC Tournament MVP.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=6| Regular season\n!colspan=6| 1979 Ohio Valley Conference Men's Basketball Tournament"

When he made the varsity team as a sophomore, Schiller helped the Wolverines establish themselves as one of the top defensive teams in the country and reach the NCAA tournament. Schiller was one of three Wolverines to earn AHCA Second Team All-American honors that year. In the tournament Schiller earned only a single assist but his defensive work earned him a spot on the All-Tournament Second Team.\nIn his junior season the Michigan defense was nearly impenetrable and Schiller was again named an All-American. In their march towards a sixth championship Michigan needed all the defensive work they could summon in the semifinal. Despite a furious effort, St. Lawrence was held to a single goal in their overtime win. The Wolverine offense showed up in the final, scoring 7 goals against Michigan Tech, including one from Schiller, and the team captured its second consecutive title. In his senior season Michigan again reached the championship game, however, the team could not restrain the dominating offense from Colorado College and lost 6–13, the highest-scoring championship game in history (as of 2020).\nAfter graduating with a degree in Aeronautical and Aerospace Engineering, Schiller played two seasons for the Toledo Mercurys while earning his MBA."

        "title": "Francisco Herrera (baseball)",
        "text": "Francisco \"Chico\" Herrera is a clubhouse attendant for the Los Angeles Dodgers. He became a media sensation after he was put in to play on the field in the team's 2020 intrasquad preseason scrimmages.\nAmateur career.\nHerrera is a native of Hollywood, California. He attended Hollywood High School, where he played baseball. His high school coach stated that he could have played on a Division I college team, but his inner-city school was never scouted. He was noted as a good fielder, playing the shortstop position, and hit for high average—over .300 every year of high school, including an over-.500 senior-year batting average. He was also a good base stealer. Herrera next attended Los Angeles Valley College, where he was the starting shortstop for the baseball team from 2009 to 2010.\nDodgers organization.\nHerrera first joined the Dodgers organization as a part-time clubhouse attendant in 2008, at the age of 18. He has also filled the role of ball boy and bat boy for the team. As a ball boy, Herrera was often noticed for his sideline catches in games. His team responsibilities also included shagging balls in the outfield during batting practice, and playing catch to warm up the team's pitchers.\nIn 2012, Herrera garnered media attention when, after several years as an employee, he was invited to an open tryout for the Dodgers. One pitcher he caught for, Jon Garland, had noted his strong arm in 2011 and persuaded De Jon Watson, the Dodgers' assistant general manager for player development, to allow Herrera to try out. Herrera participated in the open tryout in Glendale, Arizona, on March 2, 2012. After the tryout, Herrera was ultimately not offered a player's contract by the team, but returned to his regular staff duties. Watson complimented Herrera's speed and arm, but felt his hitting needed more work.\n\"Don't run on Chico\".\nIn 2020, before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic-shortened Major League Baseball season, teams played intrasquad scrimmage games to get into playing shape before the first preseason exhibition games. With the Dodgers attempting to limit the number of players needed to field two squads, Herrera was asked to step in as left fielder and occasional pinch runner, nearly a decade since his last involvement in competitive play.\nHerrera made his scrimmage debut on July 8, 2020. He played with a jersey numbered 97, with \"Francisco\" across the back. He initially misplayed his first fielding attempt, allowing the batter to reach third base. However, a series of subsequent fielding plays caught the attention of players and broadcasters, and earned him praise on social media and in sports media. In a play in his first game, Herrera caught a fly ball and held a tagging runner at third with a strong throw home, preventing a run from scoring. In another play on July 11, Herrera initiated a double play by catching a fly ball deep in left field, and then throwing out Chris Taylor at second base, who was attempting to tag up.\nThe night after the play on Taylor, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts announced it would be Herrera's last game, as the team was in need of getting more players into extended game time and had less need for a fill-in. The next night's starting pitcher, Ross Stripling, tweeted that he was lobbying for Herrera to keep playing. Herrera continued making subsequent appearances despite Roberts' earlier statement. On July 14, Herrera was back in the outfield, and taking the place of demoted minor leaguer Anthony García. In that game, Herrera made an even more impressive fielding play, with a running overhead catch of a deep Mookie Betts fly ball to the warning track, after which he turned and threw back to the cutoff man, who threw out the runner at first base.\nAs a result of Herrera's strong throws, many commentators began using the phrase \"Don't Run on Chico\" and the hashtag #DontRunOnChico, and his highlights were shared widely. He received supportive tweets from Dodgers players, such as Stripling and Justin Turner, and his highlights were shared on the official Dodgers Twitter account with the hashtag, and in their mlb.com reports.\nHerrera was profiled in the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Sports Illustrated\", and \"The Athletic\", and interviewed in a segment for MLB Network's \"Intentional Talk\". Coverage of Herrera cast him as a \"heartwarming story\" of an \"unlikely hero\" during a time of otherwise mostly bad news in the world, amid the global COVID-19 pandemic and cancellation of professional sports. Many Dodgers players were supportive of the attention Herrera received, and even pushed for him to continue being given playing time. While he never received an at-bat, many on social media called for Herrera to be given a chance to hit, and Turner wore a shirt to practice printed with the hashtag #LetChicoHit."

The \"Rest of the World\" team won by 113 points.\nThe \"England\" team was Rex Williams, Fred Davis, Graham Miles, John Spencer and John Pulman. The \"Rest of the World\" team was Ray Reardon (Wales), Eddie Charlton (Australia), Cliff Thorburn (Canada) and Alex Higgins and Jackie Rea (both Northern Ireland).\nBroadcasts were on ITV from 7 April 1975, with commentary by Shaw Taylor."

        "title": "2020 Breeders' Cup",
        "text": "The 2020 Breeders' Cup World Championships was the 37th edition of the premier event of the North American thoroughbred horse racing year. The 14 races, all but one of which were Grade I, took place on November 6 and 7 at Keeneland racetrack in Lexington, Kentucky. The races were telecast by NBCSN on Friday and early Saturday, and by NBC later on Saturday. \nThe Breeders' Cup is generally regarded as the end of the North American racing season, although a few Grade I events take place in later November and December. The event typically determines champions in many of the Eclipse Award divisions.\nQualifying.\nA maximum of 14 horses (12 in the Dirt Mile) are allowed to start in each race. Horses can automatically qualify by winning one of the designated races in the Breeders' Cup Challenge series, which provide \"Win and You're In\" berths in a specified division of the Breeders' Cup. Other pre-entries are ranked by a points system and the judgement of a panel of experts.\nOn October 28, a total of 201 pre-entries were taken for the Breeders' Cup races, of which 48 horses were automatic qualifiers. Despite strict travel protocols relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, 47 horses from overseas were pre-entered, including 10 from the barn of leading Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien.\nEvent preparation.\nOn August 17, 2018, the Breeders' Cup organization announced that Keeneland would host the event for the second time in 2020. Keeneland's first Breeders' Cup in 2015 was highlighted by American Pharoah's win in the Breeders' Cup Classic, completing the Grand Slam of Thoroughbred racing. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the racing schedule leading up to the event was disrupted. Keeneland had hoped that they would be able to hold the event before a live audience but ultimately decided to limit attendance to the participants and essential personnel. Despite this, they were able to maintain the same purse structure as in 2019, providing a total of $31 million in purses and awards.\nRaces.\nThe sequence of races was announced on October 28 along with the wagering menu and guaranteed pools for various multi-race wagers. For example, there was a guaranteed minimum pool of $2 million for the late Pick 4 and late Pick 5 wagers on Saturday. In part because of a major upset in the Mile, a winning 50¢ Pick 5 wager paid $81,406.70.\nPrior to the start of racing, jockey Christophe Soumillon tested positive for the coronavirus and did not race. Two of the horses he was scheduled to ride, Order of Australia and Tarnawa, subsequently won their races. Jockeys Pierre-Charles Boudot and Colin Keane picked up the mounts, and earned their first wins at the Breeders' Cup. Trainer Brad Cox had four winners over the weekend, tying Richard Mandella's record.\nFriday, November 6.\nThe track condition was fast on the main track and good on the turf. Essential Quality established himself up as the early favorite for the 2021 Kentucky Derby by winning the Juvenile with a late run. Horses trained in Europe were winless in the three turf races, though European-bred Aunt Pearl did win the Juvenile Fillies Turf. \nAn asterisk after the odds means the horse was the post-time favorite.\nSource: Equibase Charts\nSaturday, November 7.\nThe main track was again fast, and Gamine set a new track record for seven furlongs while winning the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint, the first Breeders' Cup race on the card, and Knicks Go set another track record in the Dirt Mile. In his fourth try, Whitmore finally won the Sprint at age seven with a come-from-behind win. Monomoy Girl, who had won the Distaff in 2018 but missed all of her 2019 season due to illness and injury, came back to win again in 2020. And Authentic capped off the program by winning the Classic, almost certainly locking up American Horse of the Year honors.\nOn the turf course, Glass Slippers became the first horse shipped from Europe to win at the 2020 event and the first European to ever win the Turf Sprint. European-based horses swept the remainder of the turf races with Audarya, longshot Order of Australia and Tarnawa winning the Filly &amp; Mare Turf, Mile and Turf respectively. Order of Australia's win was the biggest upset of the weekend, at 73-1, and led an Aidan O'Brien sweep of the Mile.\nSource: Equibase Charts"

The Breeders' Cup organization pays the Breeders' Cup entry fee for the challenge race winners, provided they had been nominated as foals. \nSummary.\nThe selected races vary somewhat from year to year as the Breeders' Cup attempts to attract the best horses in each division. The Breeders' Cup organization normally makes an announcement in April about the races that it will add or remove from the previous year's schedule for the new year. Because of the disruption to the racing schedule caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Breeders' Cup organization instead made several adjustments to the normal series throughout 2020.\nThe 2019 Breeders' Cup Challenge series consisted of 86 races from across 11 countries. New races for 2020 include the Victoria Mile at Tokyo Racecourse (Filly &amp; Mare Turf), Carter Handicap at Belmont Park (Sprint), Alabama Stakes at Saratoga (Distaff) and the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico (Classic).\nThe following races were removed from the 2020 series: Gran Premio Criadores, Gran Premio Club Hipico Falabella, Gran Premio Pamplona, Princess Rooney Handicap, John A. Nerud, Beverly D., Arlington Million, Jockey Club Derby, Cotillion and Sprinters Stakes.\nOn October 28, a total of 201 pre-entries were taken for the Breeders' Cup races, of which 48 horses were automatic qualifiers through the Challenge series races.\nFive winners from the challenge series went on to win at the 2020 Breeders' Cup:\nChallenge Series races.\nThe following table shows the Breeders' Cup Challenge races for 2020 and the respective winners.

He was previously the associate head coach and offensive coordinator at the University of Hawaii, where he also played college football.\nPlaying career.\nSmith played center at Hawaii from 1998 to 2001. He was also the team's starting long snapper in that same time duration. He was the college roommate of Nick Rolovich, and the two would practice long snaps in their apartment hallway. Following his playing career at Hawaii, Smith signed professional contracts with the Green Bay Packers and Baltimore Ravens in 2002 and 2003, respectively.\nCoaching career.\nAfter spending one year coaching the offensive line at Royal High School in Simi Valley, California, Smith joined the coaching staff at Hawaii as a student assistant while he completed his bachelor's degree. He also spent time as an assistant at Cal Lutheran, Oregon State, and Portland State.\nSecond stint at Hawaii.\nSmith was hired to be the offensive line coach at Hawaii in 2008 on Greg McMackin's inaugural staff, before shifting to coaching running backs in 2009. Smith was not retained by newly hired head coach Norm Chow for the 2012 season.\nReturn to Cal Lutheran and Occidental College.\nSmith spent 2012 as the offensive line coach at Cal Lutheran, and was hired to be the offensive coordinator and offensive line coach at Occidental College in 2013.\nThird stint at Hawaii.\nSmith joined the Hawaii coaching staff for the third time in his coaching career, this time under his college roommate Rolovich and as the associate head coach and offensive coordinator. He was also the team's running backs coach the entire duration of his stint, while also working as the tight ends coach in 2017 before the position was vacated in 2018 due to the change in offensive scheme from spread option to run and shoot.\nWashington State.\nAfter Rolovich departed Hawaii to be the next head coach at Washington State, Smith was considered by the public eye to be a possible successor to Rolovich at Hawaii before Todd Graham was named the Rainbow Warriors head coach a couple of weeks later. Smith was then officially added to Rolovich's coaching staff as the offensive coordinator &amp; running backs coach. He added the title of associate head coach in 2021.\nOhio.\nSmith was named the passing game coordinator and running backs coach at Ohio in 2022. In his first season with the Bobcats Smith coached running back Sieh Bangura to Freshman All-American honors and MAC Freshman of the Year honors while improving the Ohio passing attack to 23rd nationally, up from 108th in previous season."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Broncos represent Santa Clara University in the NCAA's West Coast Conference.\nSanta Clara began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1904. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Santa Clara's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "title": "Eskimo archery",
        "text": "&lt;noinclude&gt;\nTraditional Inuit hunters lack the more elastic timbers used to make bows in temperate and tropical parts of the world. Using sinew cords for the back of the bow, and spruce timber or antler for the belly, however, they build very effective weapons. When hunting polar bears, the bows used are powerful enough, if they do not hit bone, to penetrate completely through the body of the bear.\nCable-backed bows.\nSpruce wood is nearly inelastic in compression, but usually the best available material for the belly of the bow. Driftwood, antler from caribou, or musk ox horn, have also been used. First, the stave is shaped by stone or iron tools, often to a broad shape up to some 5cm wide to help the material to withstand compression. If made from antler or bone, which are stiff and brittle, the stave might be made of several pieces to allow it to bend. The stave could be straight, reflexed, or deflexed. \nThe back of the bow is then made of caribou sinews twisted into cables, and attached to the bowstave and to each other by knotting. (In more temperate climates, animal glue has been used to attach sinew to the backs of bows, but this is not practical for use in the Arctic because animal glue gels almost instantly in freezing air. Additionally, Arctic material culture traditionally often lacked both the fuel supplies and the vessels that are needed for prolonged boiling to make animal glue.) Knotted cables can also be raised from the back of the bowstave by spacers, making the bow lighter and more efficient. \nThe mechanical properties of sinew-backed bows change with changes in humidity, so the bows need frequent adjustment by the archer. The adjustment of tension is done by twisting the backing cables, using short rods of ivory, wood, or bone inserted through the cables. \nVarieties of cable-backed bow have been made by non-Inuit cultures. Tlingit and Haida people have also made such bows. A distinct variant of cable-backed bow is the Penobscot bow or Wabenaki bow, invented by Frank Loring (Chief Big Thunder) about 1900. It consists of a small bow attached by cables on the back of a larger main bow.\nArrows.\nBlunt arrowheads can be used for hunting small game. \"Such an arrow kills a small bird or little animal like a lemming or ground squirrel by stunning it, and does not tear a great hole in it. The boys' arrows nowadays are often headed with empty copper cartridge cases, and I have seen one of these shot clean through the body of a small bird.\"\nArrows used for hunting larger game in traditional Inuit culture are barbed, often with detachable heads. \"For hunting the reindeer the arrow had a long, sharp, bayonet-shaped head made of antler, barbed on one edge and fitted loosely into the shaft. As the Eskimos told us, when they hit a deer with one of these arrows the shaft could drop out, leaving the barbed head in the wound, and the deer would go off, \"sleep one night, and then die.\" \"Geese, gulls, and other large fowls were shot with arrows that had long, five-sided heads of walrus ivory, not very sharp and barbed on one edge...\" Those used for hunting sea otters were red, attached loosely to the barb with a long red cord. The hunter would shoot and then chase the sea otter, which would be hampered in swimming by the trailing arrow shaft. The hunter would be able to see the shaft's bright color and locate the sea otter, exhausted from the chase.\nQuivers.\nOne sealskin case protects the bow and arrows against moisture, but also has ivory implements to twist, tighten and adjust the bow and cable if needed.\nIn the late 19th century, sealskin cases to protect the bows and sealskin quivers were noted. \"The bow was carried, strung ready for use, in a sheath of tanned sealskin slung across the shoulders in such a way that it could easily be drawn out under the right arm. Nowadays they carry their rifles in similar sheaths. Attached to the sheath was a quiver, also of sealskin, in which they used to keep an assortment of arrows, some of each kind, according to the hunter's needs.\""

The award has been presented since the 2012 season and the winner is chosen by a vote amongst the members of the Cricket Writers' Club, an association open to \"recognised correspondents of newspapers and periodicals and on radio and television\". Any male player competing in the County Championship is eligible.\nNick Compton was the first recipient of the award in 2012, and is one of six winners to have been recognised for their batting exploits: the only bowlers to have won the award were Jamie Porter in 2017 and Simon Harmer in 2019. Harmer is also one of only two non-English players to have won, along with his South African compatriot Wayne Madsen. Players representing Essex have won the award three times, those from Yorkshire have won it twice, while no other county has been represented more than once. The most recent winner is Alastair Cook, whose 563 runs helped Essex to secure the 2020 Bob Willis Trophy.\nFor six of the nine seasons that the award has been given, the Cricket Writers' Club County Championship Player of the Year has also been named one of the five \"Wisden\" Cricketers of the Year; only Wayne Madsen in 2013, Keaton Jennings in 2016 and Cook in 2020 missed out. Three of the winners also claimed awards voted on by the members of the Professional Cricketers' Association (the players' trade union) in the same season; Compton and Lyth won the PCA Player of the Year award in 2012 and 2014, while in 2017, Porter won the PCA Young Player of the Year.\nThe 2020 award was given for performances in the Bob Willis Trophy, which replaced the County Championship for the shortened 2020 season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom."

        "text": "The 1922–23 Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey season was the 25th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAt the start of their season, the Harvard Crimson did not demonstrate a strong offensive game. They were only able to defeat a weak BU squad 2–0 (albeit with a large number of alternates) and then managed just three goals in regulation against Toronto. When they began their conference schedule in mid-January the Crimson fell to Princeton for the first time since 1917 after only being able to muster a single goal. Harvard escaped with a win in the following game against Yale after another regulation with just a single goal scored.\nWhile it may have appeared that Harvard was back to it dominating self after trouncing MIT 10–0, they were back to close games after a 19-day layoff. The Crimson defense remained stout through the remainder of the season, allowing just 6 goals in it final six games, but the offense was shut out twice and it was the meeting with Dartmouth on 21 February that cost Harvard dearly. The Dartmouth squad was one of the strongest in the nation and entered the contest with a record of 12–1. Harvard could ill afford a loss if they wanted to capture the intercollegiate title, but the offense was silenced by the Indians and the Crimson would be unable to claim another ice hockey championship.\nDespite the offensive struggles, Harvard won three of their final four games, including the rubber matches against both Princeton and Yale to earn the Triangular League title. They also receive a bit of help from the Tigers, who downed Dartmouth in the final game for the Indians. The loss meant that Harvard, Dartmouth and Princeton were in a three-way tie with one another and a claim by any for the intercollegiate championship would be dubious at best.\nIn the team's final game of the season coach Clafin, in concert with captain Owen, invented a new strategy by changing all three forwards at the same time. This method would come to be called a 'line change' and is still used in modern hockey. While it is unknown whether or not the scheme had been used before, it was certainly the first time it had been employed in college hockey.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "List of NCAA Division III men's ice hockey seasons",
        "text": "Nebulous Beginning.\nIn 1973 the NCAA changed its classification system to a numerical method. Schools were reclassified in three separate divisions with Division III being the lowest. The former College Division teams were mostly slotted into Division II despite a majority coming from D-III schools. Because the NCAA did not hold a national tournament for either D-II or D-III at the time there was no need to have a formal delineation between the two lower divisions, however, ECAC 3 had already been formed out of schools from ECAC 2 in order to allow them to participate in a more balanced conference. While there was no formal classification of ECAC 3 as a D-III conference until much later, the teams in ECAC 3 and the independents who later joined the conference are sometimes regarded as NCAA Division III programs during the first decade of play.\n \nTournament Play Begins.\nIn 1983 the NCAA announced they would hold an NCAA Division III Championship for the upcoming season. While most of the teams that were eligible for tournament continued to play at the Division II level, they submitted bids for the new championship at the end of the season. Due to the level of interest the tournament was founded as an 8-team championship with no automatic bids being offered. Prior to the tournament, because no conference championships were yet held for western teams, an 8-team qualifying tournament was held instead to determine which teams would receive bids to the national tournament. The regional tournament was discontinued after 1985 when the western conferences began their league playoffs.\nBecause the Division III level was skewed towards eastern teams, that region received more bids than the western teams for the first three years. Afterwards, both the eastern and western regions received 4 bids each.\n \nIncreased Participation.\nIn 1994 the NESCAC, the primary conference for several eastern teams, announced that they were rescinding their policy barring member schools from participating in national tournaments. Their new policy, however, restricted members to only one postseason tournament. Because of that, some ECAC East schools had to decide whether or not they would participate in their conference tournament or sit out and hope that the selection committee would choose to offer them a bid. Williams was the first teams to take the gamble in 1994, but they did not receive a bid. The following year Middlebury sat out the ECAC East Tournament and received a bid. This began a five-year run for the Panthers as NCAA champions, the longest unbroken streak for a champion at any level of college hockey.\n \nTournament Expansion and Exclusion.\nIn 1999 the NCAA announced a plan to begin offering automatic bids for the Division III NCAA tournament. As part of this new policy, they would only offer bids to conference tournament champions of eligible Division III leagues. To qualify, none of the postseason participants could be ranked above Division III and the conference must have at least 7 members playing during the season. This caused several changes to college hockey, including the NESCAC sponsoring ice hockey as a sport for the first time and the termination of its policy restricting member teams to only one postseason tournament.\nDue to five eastern conferences and two western conferences qualifying, the NCAA also abandoned its policy of having an equal number of eastern and western teams participate in the tournament. One at-large bid would be offered to the non-league champion with the best record but, after two years, the tournament was expanded to 9 teams with a second at-large bid included so that each region could provide an additional team. A further at-large bid was added in 2006 which could go to either region. The tournament was expanded to 11 teams in 2009 with an additional at-large bid which was converted into an automatic qualifier once the MCHA met NCAA regulations in 2010. \nConference realignment and dissolution.\nIn 2009 the MASCAC began sponsoring ice hockey for the first time. The 5 member schools, along with 2 associate members, formed the league's new ice hockey division but despite meeting the NCAA's requirements for an automatic bid, the conference didn't receive one until 2012. The following year, 2013, the WIAC began sponsoring ice hockey for the first time. As a result all 5 member schools that fielded teams left the NCHA. The NCHA responded by absorbing all members of the MCHA in order to retain its automatic qualifier. Due to the WIAC not having enough members the conference champion did not receive an automatic qualifier, bringing the number of at-large bids back to 4 since the MCHA no longer existed.\nIn 2017 the NCAA increased the number of tournament participants to 12 and offered the additional bid to one conference tournament champion whose league did not meet the minimum NCAA membership requirement. This bid was later given to the UCHC champion.\n "

After the Irish Free State was granted independence in 1922, however, the club reverted to the name Curragh Golf Club. In 1981, William Gibson, Commandant of the Club, received confirmation from the Home Office in Westminster that the royal title had never been withdrawn. In May 2011, the state visit by Elizabeth II to the Republic of Ireland, the first royal visit since that of George V in 1911, was seen as popular and marked a new relationship between Britain and Ireland. In 2013, the club voted to restore the 'royal' prefix, and its name reverted to the Royal Curragh Golf Club.\nCourse.\nThe present course opened in 2007 and was designed by Patrick Merrigan. It has a length of 6586 yards and a par of 72. The course is built on The Curragh plain."

        "text": "The 2020–21 UEFA Champions League group stage began on 20 October 2020 and ended on 9 December 2020. A total of 32 teams competed in the group stage to decide the 16 places in the knockout phase of the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League.\nKrasnodar, Midtjylland, İstanbul Başakşehir and Rennes made their debut appearances in the group stage. Istanbul became the first city to provide four different participating teams in the group stage. This group stage was also the first in Champions League history to include three Russian teams.\nDraw.\nThe draw was held at the RTS Studios in Geneva, Switzerland on 1 October 2020 at 17:00 CEST.\nThe 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, with the restriction that teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots based on the following principles (Regulations Article 13.06):\nOn 17 July 2014, the UEFA emergency panel ruled that Ukrainian and Russian clubs would not be drawn against each other \"until further notice\" due to the political unrest between the countries.\nMoreover, for associations with two or more teams, teams were paired in order to split them into two sets of four groups (A–D, E–H) for maximum television coverage. The following pairings were announced by UEFA after the group stage teams were confirmed:\nOn each matchday, one set of four groups played their matches on Tuesday, while the other set of four groups played their matches on Wednesday, with the two sets of groups alternating between each matchday. The fixtures were decided after the draw, using a computer draw not shown to public, with the following match sequence (Regulations Article 16.02):[2]\nThere were scheduling restrictions: for example, teams from the same city (e.g. Real Madrid &amp; Atlético Madrid and Manchester City &amp; Manchester United) in general were not scheduled to play at home on the same matchday (to avoid them playing at home on the same day or on consecutive days, due to logistics and crowd control), and teams from \"winter countries\" (e.g. Russia) were not scheduled to play at home on the last matchday (due to cold weather).\nTeams.\nBelow were the participating teams (with their 2020 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their seeding pot. They included:\nNotes\nFormat.\nIn each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The group winners and runners-up advanced to the round of 16, while the third-placed teams entered the Europa League round of 32.\nTiebreakers.\nTeams were ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss). If two or more teams were tied on points, the following tiebreaking criteria were applied, in the order given, to determine the rankings (see Article 17 Equality of points – group stage, Regulations of the UEFA Champions League):\nGroups.\nThe matchdays were 20–21 October, 27–28 October, 3–4 November, 24–25 November, 1–2 December, and 8–9 December 2020. The scheduled kickoff times were 21:00 CET/CEST, with two matches on each Tuesday and Wednesday scheduled for 18:55 CET/CEST.\nTimes were CET/CEST, as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses).\nGroup A.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup C.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup D.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup E.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup F.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup G.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup H.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

As of the next college basketball season in 2024–25, the Ducks represent the University of Oregon in the NCAA Division I Big Ten Conference.\nOregon began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1902. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Oregon's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "The 1924–25 Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey season was the 27th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nWith new coach Edward Bigelow behind the bench, Harvard received some impactful news in the offseason. Yale's home building, the New Haven Arena, had burned down, leaving the team without a local venue. This would give Harvard an advantage over the Elis as all games between the two teams would be played at the Boston Arena. Additionally, the team lost only five players to graduation and those spots would be filled by men from an undefeated freshman team.\nHarvard got a quick start on the season, defeating MIT 8–3 and Boston University 6–1, before taking on the Boston hockey Club. The 1–8 loss demonstrated that the team still had a ways to go, but the return of Hammond, Howard and Chase from their respective absences would help the team's fortunes.\nWhen Harvard returned from their winter break they found Toronto waiting for them for the fourth consecutive year. This time, however, Harvard was able to put together a winning effort for the first time since 1913. After narrowly losing to another amateur club, Harvard got a leg up on Yale with a 3–2 overtime win, then followed that with a defeat of Princeton the following week. After keeping its intercollegiate record unblemished, Harvard had two chances to defeat its conference rivals and would need them when Yale evened the series with their own 3–2 win.\nAfter keeping their intercollegiate championship hopes alive with a close victory over Dartmouth, Harvard faced Yale in a rubber match that was likely to decide the Triangular League and Intercollegiate championships. The two titans fought a defensive battle with Yale utilizing a similar form of line change as the Crimson. The gambit allowed the Bulldogs' top players to keep up with Harvard long into the night and, after regulation ended without a goal, overtime was required. Neither goaltender surrendered a marker in the two extra periods so a third, sudden-death period was needed. It took six minutes for Yale's Harrison Turnbull to score the only goal of the game and end Harvard's pursuit of a championship.\nHarvard won their final game of the season, narrowly defeating Princeton, to finish in second place in the Triangular League.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "U Sports men's volleyball",
        "text": "U Sports men's volleyball is the highest level of amateur play of men's indoor volleyball in Canada and operates under the auspices of U Sports (formerly Canadian Interuniversity Sport). Thirty-one teams from Canadian universities are divided into three athletic conferences, drawing from the three of the four regional associations of U Sports: Canada West Universities Athletic Association (CW), Ontario University Athletics (OUA), and Réseau du sport étudiant du Québec (RSEQ). The Atlantic University Sport (AUS) formerly featured men's volleyball as a U Sports championship sport, but it was removed following the 2017–18 season. The 31 participating teams compete in a regular season and following intra-conference playoffs, eight teams are selected to play in a national tournament to compete for the U Sports men's volleyball championship.\nBrief history.\nMen's university volleyball can be traced back to the 1950s when teams like the Alberta Golden Bears would play organized matches against other schools in the Western Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Association (WCIAA). The Atlantic Intercollegiate Athletic Association (AIAA) first awarded a conference championship in men's volleyball in 1961 with the Acadia Axemen being the conference's first dominant presence. The Ontario-Quebec Athletic Association (O-QAA) first awarded a conference title to the Toronto Varsity Blues which came in the 1965–66 season.\nThe CIAU organized the first national championship tournament which was held in Calgary, Alberta in 1967 and featured the UBC Thunderbirds defeating the Mount Allison Mounties and then the Sherbrooke Vert et Or in the championship match to be named the first national champions.\nIn 1971, Quebec universities made the decision to restrict conference competition to within their own province and the Quebec Universities Athletic Association was created, leaving the O-QAA to be renamed the Ontario Universities Athletic Association (OUAA). Teams were further sub-divided in 1972 in the WCIAA, with the Manitoba Bisons, Winnipeg Wesmen, and Regina Cougars playing in the separate Great Plains Athletic Association (later renamed Great Plains Athletic Conference (GPAC)) while the remaining teams from Alberta and British Columbia played in the Canada West Universities Athletic Association (CWUAA). The GPAC and CWUAA combined back into one conference starting in the 2001–02 season.\nThe members of the Atlantic University Sport (AUS) conference (formerly the MIAA) had seen a reduction over the years and would play regular season inter-conference games with the Réseau du sport étudiant du Québec (RSEQ, formerly QUAA). The Memorial Sea-Hawks discontinued their men's volleyball program after the 2016–17 season, leaving the AUS with only two teams, which was below the three-team league minimum for a varsity sport. After a transition year, the Dalhousie Tigers and UNB Reds joined the RSEQ, resulting in the AUS conference's exit from men's volleyball. The 2020 championship tournament and the entire 2020–21 season were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSeason structure.\nExhibition season.\nTo prepare for the season, teams will typically play a series of exhibition games against conference and non-conference opponents. These games are usually played in September and/or October before the regular season and in December and/or January during the holiday break. In 2019, the Can Am Volleyball Holiday Showcase was created which featured eight teams from across North America, including those competing in the NCAA. The 2019 tournament featured four U Sports teams and four NCAA teams, including the defending U Sports national champion Trinity Western Spartans and the NCAA national champion Long Beach State Beach.\nRegular season.\nAs of the 2022-23 season, the RSEQ begin their season first, on the second Friday of October. The Canada West conference begins play one week later and the OUA conference begins their season on the first weekend of November. All regular season games are in-conference and the schedule ends in approximately mid-February.\nIn the RSEQ conference, the five teams play against each opponent four times (twice home and twice away) for a total of 16 regular season games. In the OUA, the 13 teams play against ten different opponents twice, for a total of 20 games. The OUA previously had two divisions, but moved to singular conference play beginning with the 2022-23 season. Canada West has a similar format to the OUA, where 13 teams play all opponents twice, for a total of 24 games.\nFollowing the conclusion of the regular season, the best player in U Sports Men's volleyball is given the Player of the Year Award. An award is also given to the Rookie of the Year and the Dale Iwanoczko Award is given to the best well-rounded student (volleyball, academics and community involvement). An award was also given for the Libero of the Year, but it was discontinued after the 2014–15 season.\nPlayoffs.\nAfter the regular season, playoff games and series are held between the top teams in each conference to determine conference champions. In the RSEQ, the top four teams qualify for the playoffs and play a best-of-three series in the semi-finals and in the conference championship. In Canada West, the top eight teams qualify for the playoffs and play best-of-three series in playoff brackets in the quarterfinals. The winners of these series play in best-of-three semifinals until two teams remain where they play in a single elimination conference championship game.\nThe OUA is the only conference that features a single elimination format in all playoff games. Teams are seeded one through eight and advance to the semi-finals in a bracket format with the higher-seeded team hosting each game. The highest-seeded remaining team hosts the conference championship, the Forsyth Cup.\nNational championship.\nThe U Sports men's volleyball championship was introduced for the 1966–67 season to determine a national champion for the CIAU. A predetermined host university stages the eight-team tournament over three days and finals games are played on the last day to award gold, silver, and bronze medals. The host team is automatically qualified for the tournament, as are each of the conference champions. Four other teams are entered based on the strength of their conferences and their post-season finishes. The Manitoba Bisons, Alberta Golden Bears, and Winnipeg Wesmen have won the most championships with 10 gold medals won apiece, although the Bisons have won the most medals overall (24 for Manitoba, 21 for Alberta, and 15 for Winnipeg). Quebec City has hosted the most championships with 12 which were all hosted by Université Laval (most recently in 2019). The national championship has historically been dominated by the Canada West conference with those teams winning 49 of the 56 championship matches as of the 2023–24 season. The OUA and AUS have never had a national men's volleyball champion. The 2020 championship tournament and the 2020–21 season were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTeams.\nMembership.\nThe AUS conference had featured three teams following the exit of the Moncton Aigles Bleus in 2006 and featured inter-conference matches with the RSEQ. The RSEQ had also been reduced to three teams in 2011 after McGill disbanded their men's program. The Memorial Sea-Hawks folded their program after the 2016–17 season, leaving the AUS with one team short of the three-team minimum for a varsity league. However, the AUS allowed Dalhousie and UNB to play a transitional season before joining the RSEQ as full members for the 2018–19 season.\nConversely, the Canada West conference added teams with the UBCO Heat joining in 2011–12, Mount Royal Cougars in 2012–13, and MacEwan Griffins in 2014–15. While the Regina Cougars program was cut following the 2017–18 season, the Fraser Valley Cascades volleyball program was granted membership for the 2020–21 season which was deferred to the 2021–22 season. 31 teams competed in the 2023–24 season."

        "text": "Jack G. McManus is a Canadian retired ice hockey forward who helped Michigan Tech reach the National Championship game for the first time in program history in 1956.\nCareer.\nMcManus arrived in Houghton in the fall of 1953 and, due to the team not having a freshman team, began playing immediately for the varsity squad. He put up modest totals in his first year but broke out as a star in his sophomore season. He led the team in scoring with 25 goals and 45 points in 25 games as Tech rose from dead last in the WIHL to 4th. The surprising jump earned McManus an AHCA Second Team All-American spot. The team continued to ascend as McManus led the offense; the Huskies finished 2nd in their conference in 1955–56 and received the second western seed for the NCAA Tournament. Michigan Tech blew past Boston College in the semifinal with a 10–4 win, and advanced to face Michigan in the championship match. McManus assisted on the Huskies first goal of the game and the contest went back and forth through the first half. Tech grabbed a lead in the 2nd period but it lasted all of 30 seconds and three successive goals from the Wolverines put them ahead for good.\nIn his final season McManus was named team captain and led the team in scoring for the third consecutive season. He finished his career as the all-time leader in both goals (88) and points (160) and despite playing in far fewer games than most succeeding players he still remains 5th on in goals in program history.\nA few years after graduating, McManus played for the Minneapolis Millers in their first season but called it quits soon thereafter. He was inducted into the Michigan Tech Athletic Hall of Fame in 1995."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Cardinals represent the University of the Incarnate Word (UIW) in the NCAA Division I Southland Conference.\nIncarnate Word began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1980, and did not start play in Division I until the 2013–14 season, having previously been in Division II. While the NCAA has recorded individual points and rebounds in all three of its current divisions throughout the history of UIW men's basketball, it did not record assists in D-II until the 1988–89 season, and blocks and steals until the 1992–93 season. Nonetheless, the UIW record books include players in these statistics before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Golden Hurricanes represent the University of Tulsa in the NCAA's American Athletic Conference.\nTulsa began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1907. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Tulsa's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "title": "U Sports women's volleyball",
        "text": "U Sports women's volleyball is the highest level of amateur play of indoor volleyball in Canada and operates under the auspices of U Sports (formerly Canadian Interuniversity Sport). 42 teams from Canadian universities are divided into four athletic conferences, drawing from the four regional associations of U Sports: Canada West Universities Athletic Association (CW), Ontario University Athletics (OUA), Réseau du sport étudiant du Québec (RSEQ), and Atlantic University Sport (AUS). Following intra-conference playoffs, eight teams are selected to play in a national tournament to compete for the U Sports women's volleyball championship.\nBrief history.\nOrganized university volleyball was first played in Ontario in the 1947-48 school year between the Toronto Varsity Blues and the McMaster Marauders where the two teams finished tied for the championship title. Toronto would win the 1948-49 title in the following year. In the Western Canada Intercollegiate Athletic Union (WCIAU), the Saskatchewan Huskies were named the first champions in Western Canada for the 1949-50 season. In 1950-51, volleyball was admitted as a sport into the Women’s Intercollegiate Athletic Union (WIAU) with Toronto, McMaster, Western, and OAC becoming the first four programs to compete in an Ontario league. For the 1952-93 season, McGill and Queen's joined competition in the WIAU. The Atlantic Intercollegiate Athletic Association (AIAA) began awarding championships for volleyball for the 1959-60 season which was won by the UNB Reds.\nIn 1969, the Canadian Women’s Interuniversity Athletic Union (CWIAU) was formed to provide a national governing body for women's varsity sport in Canada. In December 1969, the WCIAU proposed by that national championships should be established, which was accepted by the CWIAU. Because this was accepted in the middle of the school year, an unofficial national championship was held at the University of Waterloo and won by the Calgary Dinos in the spring of 1970. The first official championship was awarded following the 1970-71 season and was won by the Manitoba Bisonettes over the Toronto Varsity Blues in a match that was decided in four sets.\nBeginning with the 1972-73 season, the Manitoba Bisons, Winnipeg Wesmen, and Regina Cougars played in the separate Great Plains Athletic Association (later renamed Great Plains Athletic Conference (GPAC)) while the Saskatchewan Huskies and teams from Alberta and British Columbia played in the Canada West Universities Athletic Association (CWUAA). The GPAC and CWUAA combined back into one conference starting in the 2001-02 season. The 2020 championship tournament and the entire 2020–21 season were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSeason structure.\nExhibition season.\nTo prepare for the season, teams will typically play a series of exhibition games against conference and non-conference opponents. These games are usually played in September and/or October before the regular season and in December and/or January during the holiday break.\nRegular season.\nAs of the 2023-24 season, the RSEQ begin their season first, on the second Friday of October. The Canada West conference begins play one week later and the AUS and OUA schedules begin on the fourth Friday of October. All regular season games are in-conference and the schedule ends in approximately mid-February. \nThe AUS conference features six teams that play four games against each opponent for a total of 20 regular season games. In the RSEQ, eight teams play 21 conference games for a total of three games against each opponent. In Canada West, there are 14 teams in one conference that play against 12 other opponents resulting in 24 total games played. The OUA also features 14 teams in one conference after previously having teams split in an east and west division. OUA teams play two games against 10 different opponents, leaving three teams as non-combatants for each team's schedule. For the OUA and Canada West conferences, teams will usually play the same opponent twice in one weekend for ease of travel and scheduling.\nFollowing the conclusion of the regular season, the Mary Lyons Award is awarded annually to the Player of the Year in U Sports women's volleyball. The Mark Tennant Award is given to the Rookie of the Year and the Thérèse Quigley Award is given to the best well-rounded student (volleyball, academics and community involvement). An award was also given for the Libero of the Year, but it was discontinued after the 2014-15 season.\nPlayoffs.\nAfter the regular season, playoff games and series are held between the top teams in each conference to determine conference champions. In the AUS and RSEQ conferences, the top four teams qualify for the playoffs and play a best-of-three series including in the conference championship. In Canada West, the top eight teams qualify for the playoffs and play best-of-three series in playoff brackets in the quarterfinals. The winners of these series play in best-of-three semifinals until two teams remain where they play in a single elimination conference championship game.\nThe OUA is the only conference that features a single elimination format in all playoff games. Teams are seeded one through eight and advance to the semi-finals in a bracket format with the higher-seeded team hosting each game. The highest-seeded remaining team hosts the conference championship, the Quigley Cup.\nNational championship.\nThe U Sports women's volleyball championship was officially established in 1971 following the organization of the Canadian Women’s Interuniversity Athletic Union (CWIAU). A predetermined host university stages the eight-team tournament over three days and finals games are played on the last day to award gold, silver, and bronze medals. The host team is automatically qualified for the tournament, as are each of the conference champions. Three other teams are entered based on the strength of their conferences and their post-season finishes. The UBC Thunderbirds have won the most championships with 14 gold medals won, followed by the seven titles won by each of the Alberta Pandas, Manitoba Bisons, and Winnipeg Wesmen. The national championship has historically been dominated by the Canada West conference with those teams winning 43 of the 52 championship matches as of the 2023-24 season. The 2020 and 2021 championship tournaments were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTeams.\nMembership.\nThere were 42 teams that had participated in the 2023–24 Women's volleyball season. Recently, St. Francis Xavier and Cape Breton previously had programs is the AUS conference, but they were cut due to budgetary reasons in 2013 and 2015, respectively. On the opposite side, the Canada West conference has seen a growth in team membership, adding the UBCO Heat in 2011-12, Mount Royal Cougars in 2012-13, MacEwan Griffins in 2014-15, and the UFV Cascades in 2020-21. The UQTR Patriotes are playing in the RSEQ Division 1 as of the 2021-22 season after playing in the conference's Division 2. After becoming the 57th member of U Sports, the UQAC Inuk fielded a women's volleyball team beginning in 2023. The Ottawa Gee-Gees announced intentions to move from the RSEQ to the OUA beginning with the 2024-25 season."

Additionally, Harvard accepted the new practice of playing its two defenders side by sire rather than one in front of the other. The changes did little to hamper the Crimson in their first game, however, when they returned from their Christmas break the team had to quickly prepare for Toronto. The Blues were considered by many as the top amateur team in North America and they demonstrated why when they dominated Harvard to the tune of a 6–1 victory. Harvard was able to get much more practice time before their next game and when they faced Dalhousie they appeared much more themselves.\nThe Crimson didn't lose another game after the Toronto debacle, though they did tie two amateur clubs in the middle of their season. After wrapping up the Triangular League championship, Harvard put together an informal group of players, composed of members of both the varsity and freshman teams, and played an exhibition match with Boston College. The cross-town rivals won the game in overtime, but Harvard was missing both its starting goaltender and team captain, so there was little doubt as to which varsity squad was the better.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Wildcats represent Davidson College in the NCAA's Atlantic 10 Conference.\nDavidson began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1907. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Davidson's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2019–20 season."

        "title": "2018 Real Tennis World Championship",
        "text": "The 2018 Real Tennis World Championship was a real tennis tournament held at the Queen's Club in London, England. 12-time world champion Rob Fahey regained the world title defeating the defending champion Camden Riviere by a score of 7–5.\nQualification.\nAs the defending champion, Camden Riviere qualified directly to the World Championship Challenge. The challenger was determined through a series of eliminator matches. Qualification to the eliminator matches was based on results in major tournaments in 2016 and 2017. Four players were declared eligible to compete:\nThis was the first year that Fahey had participated in the challenge tournament since 1994, as he had held the title of World Champion continuously until 2016. During the World Race, he won the 2016 Australian Open in Melbourne against Ben Taylor-Matthews and was runner up in both the 2016 and 2017 French Open as well as the 2017 US Open, losing in all cases to Camden Riviere. Before commencing the first round eliminator, he won the 2018 Australian Open in Hobart, although this did not count towards the World Race for 2018.\nVirgona had qualified to be the World Championship challenger on two occasions: first in 2010 in Melbourne and again in 2012 at the Queen's Club, losing both times to Fahey. In both 2014 and 2016, he lost the final eliminator to Camden Riviere. During the qualification period, he was runner-up at both the 2016 US Open and 2017 Australian Open, again losing both times to Riviere.\nUnlike the other qualifiers, this would be Chapman's first appearance in the World Championship eliminators, although he had competed in the early rounds of the World Doubles Championship. He was also the only competitor not to have previously won an open event. His best result was reaching the final of the 2016 British Open.\nSayers was competing in the challenge for the third time, having reached the final eliminator in 2014 and the first round in 2012, losing both times to Virgona. His best result in the qualification period was as runner-up in the 2017 British Open to world champion Camden Riviere.\nEliminators.\nThe format for the world championship eliminators was changed for 2018. In previous years, the matches were held on a home and away basis as three best-of-five set matches. In 2018, the first round eliminator were held at a single venue as a single best-of-nine set match, across two days. Four sets would be played on the first day, with the option for a fifth set if one player were to win the first four sets. The final eliminator would retain the home and away format.\nThe venues for the first round eliminators were chosen via a bidding process. Each player had the right to put in a bid for their chosen court, with the first and second seeds able to match their opponents bid if their bid was at least 80% of the rival bid. The third and fourth seeded players successfully out-bid their higher-seeded opponents, so the venues were the two London courts of Queen's and the Royal Tennis Court.\nFirst Round Eliminators.\nThe first eliminator was held at the Queen's Club in London, the home court of Bryn Sayers. The venue also regularly hosts the British Open and was scheduled to host the World Championship challenge later that year. Only a few months prior, Sayers had defeated Fahey in four sets on the same court in the British Open semi-final. Sayers started strong, winning the first set 6/4, although Fahey brought back momentum to win the next two sets 6/3 and 6/1. The final set of the first day was a narrow-fought 6/5 to Fahey. On the second day, Fahey needed two sets to progress; Sayers needed four. Although Sayers won the first set of the day again, Fahey held onto two tight sets to win.\nAcross at the Royal Tennis Court at Hampton Court, the other match saw battle between the local professional Chris Chapman and his then-doubles partner Steve Virgona. Virgona dominated the play winning the first four sets of the day. He then opted to play the fifth and ultimately final set on the same day, winning it also and negating the need for a second day of play.\nFinal Eliminator.\nThe Final Eliminator was a match-up between Virgona and Fahey. As the higher ranked player, Fahey had the choice of court for the second and third (if required) matches of the eliminator. Virgona elected to play the first match at his home club of Chicago. In the first Leg at Chicago, Virgona took an early lead in the best-of-five set match, taking the first set 4/6. But the visitor and former world champion came back strong, to take the leg in four sets. A week later at the second leg at Prested Hall, despite some tight games and excellent play, Fahey raced through in straight sets to return to the World Championship Challenge.\nWorld Challenge.\nThe 2018 World Championship Challenge was held as a best-of-13 set match between defending champion Camden Riviere and 12-time former champion Robert Fahey. In March 2017, the venue for the challenge was announced as the Queen's Club in London. It was the eighth time Queen's would host a World Championship, having previously hosted in 1905, 1955, 1957, 1976, 1981, 1985, 1987 and 2012. It was also the venue for Jeu de Paume at the 1908 Olympic Games. Both the champion and the challenger had played regularly at the venue, as it hosts the annual British Open. However, they had not met in the British Open since the semi-final in 2012, where Fahey won in straight-sets.\nThe pair had previously met in three World Championship Challenges, all of which featured Fahey as the defending champion. Their first meeting was in Fontainebleau, France in 2008, which was Riviere's first challenge. Then, Riviere had never before beaten Fahey, but gave a strong showing to win five sets from Fahey. They would next meet in Melbourne, Australia in 2014. Again, Fahey successfully defended his championship 7–3. However, since then Riviere had an undefeated record over a four-year period which included winning the World Championship at his then-home club of Newport, Rhode Island in 2016. Riviere had won seven consecutive Major Opens including a Grand Slam, from the 2016 US Open to the 2017 British Open, after which he missed the 2018 Australian Open. Nonetheless, despite his age Fahey boasted an unrivalled pedigree in the sport, with 49 Major Opens and 12 World Championships, although he had only won five opens since 2013. Prior to the match, Fahey admitted \"I'm going to be the biggest underdog since the 1930s\" as his 50th birthday would be two days after the match's conclusion.\nDay 1.\nThe match was attended by Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex and marked by Andrew Lyons, the former Queen's Club head professional.\nDespite a reputation for starting matches slowly, Fahey began the match by taking the first set 6/4. Riviere then applied the pressure throughout the remainder of the day, winning back the second set and narrowly gaining the advantage in the third as Fahey tried to hold on. By the fourth set, he was cruising and did not drop a game as Fahey started to look tired. At the end of the day, Riviere had a solid 3 sets to 1 lead.\nDay 2.\nGiven his lead from the first day, his strong history and his opponent's age, many expected the second day to be all about Riviere. However Fahey fought back hard with a tight and varied serving game and strong power hitting, as Riviere struggled to find momentum from his high-energy style of play. The fifth and six sets took nearly an hour each, with momentum swinging back and forth, but ultimately, Fahey prevailed in both. A niggling hipinjury break to Riviere did not help, as Fahey went from strength to strength. Ultimately, Fahey won every set by increasing margins to recover a 5–3 lead in the match.\nDay 3.\nGoing into the final day, Fahey needed only win two sets to recover his World Championship. The first set of the day was long and tight, with Riviere narrowly gaining the upper hand. He followed it up by winning the second set of the day comfortably to bring the match score to 5 sets all. Although it looked like the momentum was with Riviere he was struggling with his serve, which allowed Fahey to capitalise and fight back one last time to win the final two sets and thus the championship.\nResult.\nFahey won the match 7–5 to claim his record 13th World Championship. He also became the first male singles champion since Fred Covey in 1922 to recover the title after previously losing it. He re-established himself as the second-oldest world champion to Pierre Etchebaster, the match occurring two days prior to his 50th birthday. Upon claiming the trophy, he said \"I used to think that I owned this trophy. Now I know I'm just borrowing it.\""

        "text": "In 2020 Kent County Cricket Club were scheduled to compete in Division One of the County Championship, the Royal London One-Day Cup and the 2020 t20 Blast. However, the season was heavily disrupted by the global COVID-19 pandemic, with no county cricket fixtures played until August. For the shortened season, the majority of counties voted on 7 July to play first-class and Twenty20 cricket, with the Royal London One-Day Cup being cancelled. Instead of the County Championship this year, the 18 first-class counties competed for the 2020 Bob Willis Trophy, which consisted of three regional groups of six teams and a final at Lord's.\nThe season was the fourth in charge for head coach, and former player, Matthew Walker. Former Kent bowler Simon Cook became the new bowling coach after a spell as head coach of the Hong Kong national team, replacing South African Allan Donald who left the county at the end of the previous season. Former England all-rounder Michael Yardy joined Kent as the new batting coach in February 2020. Sam Billings retained the club captaincy that he was first awarded in 2018. Billings and vice-captain Joe Denly both spent time away with England squads throughout the season, and so Daniel Bell-Drummond captained the side on several occasions.\nThe delayed start of the season and the resulting loss of income meant that, like many other counties, Kent decided to cancel contracts for their overseas signings. New Zealand fast bowler Matt Henry had been due to return for the first part of the season after a highly successful spell with the county in 2018. Meanwhile, Afghan all-rounder Mohammad Nabi had signed to play for the county in the t20 Blast for a second successive year.\nSquad.\nBatsman Alex Blake signed a new white-ball (limited overs) contract with the county in January 2020, becoming the first homegrown player to sign such a deal with Kent.\nDepartures.\nMitchell Claydon left Kent after seven years with the team, to join Sussex at the end of the 2019 season. In July 2020, batsman Sean Dickson departed the club to join Durham, initially on loan for the 2020 season. On 30 July, wicket-keeper Adam Rouse announced his retirement from cricket at the age of 28, after having played four seasons with Kent.\nAll-rounder Calum Haggett and bowler Ivan Thomas were both released by the club after their contracts expired in October.\nArrivals.\nIn August 2019, Kent announced that they had signed Yorkshire all-rounder Jack Leaning on a three-year contract from October 2019. In September 2019, Kent announced the signings of teenage Afghan-born England Under-19 off-spinner Hamidullah Qadri from Derbyshire on a three-year deal. A few days later, the county also announced the signing of 35 year-old seamer Tim Groenewald from Somerset on a two-year deal from 2020.\nZimbabwean-born 20-year old fast bowler Nathan Gilchrist, who had yet to play a senior match, joined Kent in August, initially on loan from Somerset ahead of signing a three-year contract.\nBob Willis Trophy.\nMatches played in the 2020 Bob Willis Trophy had first-class status, but there were some differences to the playing conditions compared to the County Championship. The minimum number of overs in a day was reduced to 90, the follow-on increased from 150 runs to 200, the new ball was to be available after 90 overs instead of 80, and each team's first innings was restricted to a maximum of 120 overs. Kent's first match of the delayed season began on 1 August against Essex at Chelmsford."

It was the 26th season of pan-European professional club rugby competition.\nThe tournament began on 11 December 2020. The final, originally scheduled to be held at the Stade de Marseille, took place on 22 May 2021 at Twickenham Stadium.\nOn 11 January 2021, EPCR suspended the tournament as a result of further public health restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA revised format was announced on 24 February 2021.\nTeams.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic delaying the end of the previous tournament twenty-four clubs from the three major European domestic and regional leagues would compete in the Champions Cup in a one-year exceptional basis. EPCR chief Vincent Gaillard confirmed the 24-team tournament in August 2020.\nThe distribution of teams is:\nWhile the 2019–20 Top 14 season was cancelled due to COVID-19, the Premiership and Pro14 resumed in August 2020. However, the Pro14 announced in June 2020 that their European representation would be decided by standings after round 13, the final series of games before the hiatus. The following teams qualified for the tournament via their league performance.\nTeam details.\nBelow is the list of coaches, captain and stadiums with their method of qualification for each team.\nSeeding.\nThe twenty four teams would be broken down into two pools of twelve. Originally, four rounds of inter-pool play was to be followed by a knockout stage, featuring two-legged quarterfinals, and single leg semi-finals and final (to be held in Marseille on 22 May 2021). However at suspension of the tournament in January 2021, only two rounds of the pool stage were completed and the revised format would introduce a round of 16 following these.\nFor the purposes of the pool draw, the clubs would be separated into tiers based on their league finishing position, and clubs from the same league in the same tier would not be drawn into the same pool. The number 1 and number 2 ranked clubs from each league will be in Tier 1, the number 3 and number 4 ranked clubs would be in Tier 2, the number 5 and 6 ranked clubs would be in Tier 3, and the number 7 and number 8 ranked clubs would be Tier 4.\nThe pool stage would feature the Tier 1 teams playing the Tier 4 teams in their pool (that are not from the same league) twice in a home or away manner, while the Tier 2 and 3 clubs would follow in a similar manner.\nWhen the revised format was announced, the top eight teams from each pool would qualify for the knockout stage of the Champions Cup and teams finishing between 9th and 12th in each pool would join the Challenge Cup at the Round of 16 stage, joining eight qualifiers from the Challenge Cup pool stage. Due to the suspension in January 2021, only six weekends of play would be provided for, three less than in previous seasons.\nPool stage.\nThe draw took place on 28 October 2020 at the Maison du Sport International in Lausanne, Switzerland. The 24 teams were drawn into the two pools as follows, this also shows their opponents. Fixtures were announced on 13 November 2020.\nKnockout stage.\nThe knockout stage will commence with a round of 16 consisting of the top 8 ranked teams from each pool. Due to the truncation of the pool stage, a draw will be used to determine matches in both round of 16 and quarter-finals but no team will face a team from the same league in the round of 16. Teams which won both their matches and were not awarded points due to COVID cancellations would be guaranteed home advantage. Therefore, Bordeaux Bègles, Leinster, Munster, Racing 92 and Wasps will receive home advantage.\nThe draw for the round of 16 and quarter-finals took place on 9 March 2021 in Lausanne, Switzerland.\nRound of 16.\nFixtures were announced on 16 March 2021.\nSemi-finals.\nThe draw for the semi-finals took place on 11 April 2021 at BT Sport's studios in London. As a result of the pandemic all matches will be held at the designated club's home ground."

        "text": "The Panther City Lacrosse Club is a professional box lacrosse team in the National Lacrosse League. They have played at Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, Texas since their inaugural 2021–2022 season.\nHistory.\nOn July 22, 2020, the NLL awarded an expansion franchise to the city of Fort Worth and owner Bill Cameron. It was announced that the team would begin play in the 2021–2022 season, with its home arena being Dickies Arena.\nAt a press conference on November 17, 2020, the franchise officially became the Panther City Lacrosse Club. The team's unique name is in reference to Fort Worth's \"Panther City\" nickname, which stems from an 1875 article in the \"Dallas Herald\" that derisively characterized the city's economy as being so slow that a panther could sleep in the street by the courthouse. Although an intended insult, the name Panther City was enthusiastically embraced by locals after Fort Worth recovered economically. The team is also the league's first member to use the \"Lacrosse Club\" moniker, similar to teams in the Premier Lacrosse League.\nOn January 25, 2021, former Philadelphia Wings assistant Tracey Kelusky was named the team's first head coach.\nInaugural season.\nPanther City debuted on December 4, 2021, against the Wings in Philadelphia. Travis Cornwall scored the first goal in franchise history as Panther City took a 1–0 lead. Despite leading 7–4 at halftime, the team could not start 1–0 as they fell to the Wings, 12–11 in overtime. A week later on December 10, the franchise played its first ever home game at Dickies Arena, where they fell to the Vancouver Warriors, 14–8 in front of 7,309 fans. After five games, Panther City got their first franchise win on January 15, 2022, on Long Island against the New York Riptide, 13–12 thanks to an overtime goal from rookie forward Patrick Dodds. It took a month and a half and four more tries, but Panther City notched their second win and first ever home win on February 26, 11–10, in a rematch with the Warriors in front of 4,714 fans. Again it would be Patrick Dodds providing late-game heroics with a goal with 39 seconds remaining. The next week, Panther City collected a consecutive win for the first time, and set a franchise record for goals scored with a 17–16 home overtime win over the Saskatchewan Rush.\nThe streak would eventually climb to five games, catapulting the team back to the playoff race with a 6–8 record. Panther City would hang in there until the penultimate week of the regular season when they lost to the Georgia Swarm. A home loss to Saskatchewan closed out the year, though Panther City still posted the best inaugural season record by an expansion team since the San Diego Seals in 2018–19.\nDraft history.\nNLL Entry Draft.\nFirst Round Selections"

He played five further Test's for Australia, with his final appearance coming against Argentina at Buenos Aires. His career highlight was scoring the winning try against Wales in 1978, while his career low was breaking an ankle in a club match in the same which ruled him out of the tour to New Zealand.\nHe went up to University College at the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar in 1980, where he played rugby for Oxford University RFC from 1981–83, winning blues in each year. In addition to playing rugby at Oxford, Crowe also made a single appearance in first-class cricket for Oxford University against Gloucestershire at Oxford in 1982.

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Bears represent Brown University in the NCAA's Ivy League.\nBrown began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1900. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Brown's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2019–20 season."

        "text": "James Haas is a Canadian retired ice hockey defenseman and forward who won consecutive National Championships with Michigan in the 1950s.\nCareer.\nAfter playing Junior hockey for Moose Jaw and Prince Albert, Haas was recruited to Michigan and joined one of the premier powers of college hockey. While Haas played for the freshman team, the varsity squad won the 1951 Championship. Haas joined the following year and performed brilliantly, helping Michigan hold opponents to just 66 goals in 24 games, by far the lowest total of any team in the MCHL. He was named to the All-MCHL First Team and was an AHCA Second Team All-American. in his first tournament Haas collected two assists and made the All-Tournament First Team as Michigan won its second consecutive championship.\nThe following year Haas didn't perform as well on the defensive end and, as a consequence, Michigan's defense wasn't as impenetrable, but the Wolverines were still able to return to the tournament. This time it was Michigan's offense that carried them through and after demolishing Boston University 14–2 in the semifinal, Hass got in on the scoring in the championship match against Minnesota, scoring two goals and an assist in the Wolverines' 7–3 win, securing a third consecutive championship. For his senior season, Haas was named team captain and was once more a star during the season. While Michigan finished far back of Minnesota in the standings, Haas was still recognized by making appearances on the first team for both his conference and the nation. Haas led Michigan back to the tournament, seeking a fourth straight championship, but in the first game the Wolverines were stunned by upstart Rensselaer who skated rings around the larger Wolverines and knocked the maize and blue out of contention. After trashing their hotel room that night, Michigan took their frustration out on Boston College in the consolation game, winning 7–2 and finishing in third place.\nHaas graduated with a degree in geology in 1954 and then moved to Alberta where he coached bantam hockey for several years. He was inducted into the Michigan Dekers Hall of Fame in 1977."

        "text": "The 2020 Major League Lacrosse season was the 20th season of Major League Lacrosse. Each of the six teams were slated to play a ten-game regular season starting on May 30, until the COVID-19 pandemic suspended the season. On July 2, the league announced teams would play a five-game regular season over the course of a quarantined week in Annapolis, Maryland at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium, the home of the Chesapeake Bayhawks. The regular season was scheduled to begin play on Saturday, July 18 with a four-team postseason the next weekend on July 25–26.\nThe Bayhawks entered the season as defending champions. They claimed their sixth title after defeating the Denver Outlaws, 10–9 in the 2019 Steinfeld Cup Game at Dick's Sporting Goods Park in Denver.\nFor the second consecutive offseason, the landscape of the league changed dramatically. On January 14, the league announced the switch from a franchise model to a single-entity structure, meaning they will operate all six teams in 2020. On February 10, the league ceased operations of the Dallas Rattlers and moved the players and team staff to a new franchise, the Connecticut Hammerheads. The next week, the league ceased operations of the Atlanta Blaze and relocated the roster and coaches to relaunch the Philadelphia Barrage.\nOn the last evening of the shortened regular season, an unnamed player reported to team officials exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19. All league players were tested the next day. In result, the semifinal games on July 25 were canceled and the Bayhawks and Hammerheads, who were scheduled to play in the semifinal round, backed out of the postseason. The league announced the canceled semifinal game between the top seed Denver Outlaws and fourth seed and Boston Cannons would be pushed to July 26 and act as the championship game. Boston defeated Denver 13–10 to claim their second championship in franchise history.\nOn December 16, 2020, the league announced that it had merged with its competitor, Premier Lacrosse League.\nBroadcast.\nShortly after the league informed fans of its plans for a shortened season, it was announced that all 18 games would be broadcast on the ESPN family of networks. Two regular season games were aired on ESPN2 on July 19 while the championship game on July 26 aired on ESPN's flagship station. All other games would stream on ESPN+ and would be available to over 100 countries via ESPN Player. Canadian viewers were able to watch every game via TSN.\nCollegiate Draft.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, a virtual draft was held on May 4, consisting of eight rounds and 48 total picks. The New York Lizards selected faceoff specialist TD Ierlan with the first overall pick. However the next day, Ierlan announced he would be returning to Yale in 2021 after the pandemic-shortened 2020 NCAA season. Second overall pick, Michael Kraus, an attack from Virginia, signed a two-year contract with the Connecticut Hammerheads on May 14.\nPlayoffs.\n\"After positive COVID-19 test results among players, the Connecticut Hammerheads (second seed) and Chesapeake Bayhawks (third seed) backed out of the postseason.\""

Following a request to the Ministry of Public Health due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tournament was given approval in July 2020 to take place. The ACB also confirmed that it was their priority to run a successful tournament.\nThe tournament was originally scheduled to take place from 13 to 25 September 2020, with the matches being played at the Kabul International Cricket Stadium. However, the tournament was moved forward by one week, to avoid clashing with the 2020 Indian Premier League (IPL), which itself had been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Six teams took part in the tournament, and the Mis Ainak Knights were the defending champions.\nOn 20 August 2020, a players' draft took place ahead of the tournament. The ACB also stated that all Afghan players taking part in the 2020 Caribbean Premier League (CPL) should return to Afghanistan before the CPL is due to conclude, so they can be available to play in the Shpageeza Cricket League. However, after talks with the President of Cricket West Indies, it was decided that these players could finish the CPL before returning, while the players with IPL contracts would miss the tournament completely.\nThe opening match of the tournament saw the Mis Ainak Knights beat the Band-e-Amir Dragons by one run, with the Knights managing to defend 13 runs from the final over of the game.\nThe Kabul Eagles, Mis Ainak Knights, Band-e-Amir Dragons and Boost Defenders finished in the top four places in the group stage to progress to the knockout phase of the tournament. In the first qualifier, the Kabul Eagles beat the Mis Ainak Knights by four wickets. Therefore, the Eagles progressed directly to the final, with the Knights moving to the second qualifier match. In the eliminator match, the Band-e-Amir Dragons beat the Boost Defenders by 76 runs to join the Knights in the second qualifier match. The second qualifier saw the Mis Ainak Knights beat the Band-e-Amir Dragons by five wickets, to join the Kabul Eagles in the final. In the final, the Kabul Eagles beat Mis Ainak Knights by nine runs to win the tournament."

It was expensive and hard at first, but I'd have to say it's worked out.\" The year he earned his scholarship saw him more than double his scoring average from 4.5 as a sophomore to 10.1 as a junior. He started 31 of 34 games played, and rounded out his season averages with 3.1 assists and 1.5 steals.\nKnight made Ross a team captain when he became a senior in 2004–05. Ross was known for his work ethic and later that season garnered praise from Knight, who said \"He's an all-time example to kids as to what they can do with what they have.\" He again substantially increased his scoring average, netting 17.5 points per game to along with 5.5 rebounds, 3.0 assists, and 2.6 steals per game. The 6th-seeded Red Raiders advanced to the NCAA tournament's Sweet Sixteen behind Ross' great play. In the opening round win against 11th-seeded UCLA, Ross scored a then-school record for points in an NCAA Tournament game with 28 (later surpassed by Jarrett Culver in 2019). In the next round against 3rd-seeded Gonzaga, he scored 24 points, including a go-ahead three-pointer with 1:06 remaining as well as two free throws to clinch the Red Raiders' two-point win. Ross garnered several individual accolades. For Big 12 Conference honors he was named to the All-Big 12 first-team and the All-Defensive Team. Nationally, he was named the winner of the Chip Hilton Player of the Year Award, given by the NCAA to a Division I player who demonstrated outstanding character, leadership, integrity, humility, sportsmanship, and talent. Ross finished his collegiate career with 1,174 points.\nProfessional.\nFollowing Texas Tech, Ross went undrafted in the 2005 NBA draft. He quickly found a spot playing for Castelletto Ticino in Serie A2 Basket, Italy's second-tier league. After one year he returned to the United States to play in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) for the Butte Daredevils, and then in the USBL for the Albany Patroons. During his time with the Patroons he earned All-USBL first-team honors and was also named the league's defensive player of the year.\nOverall, Ross' professional career spanned 13 years (2005–2018) and included stops in Italy, Germany, Israel, Croatia, Greece, France, Cyprus, and Romania.\nCoaching career.\nTexas Tech head coach Chris Beard offered Ronald Ross a position as a graduate assistant in 2018–19. Beard had been an assistant coach under Bob Knight during Ross' college playing career, and there was much mutual respect. Ross took the position, and in his first year the Red Raiders made it to the NCAA national championship game for the first time in school history, but lost 85–77 in overtime. He coached one more season, but upon the conclusion of 2019–20 he resigned, opting to leave the coaching profession to instead to pursue a career in business. He relayed his resignation to the public via Twitter, posting \"Coaching has been a blessing and I’m confident in my capabilities to be great at it, but I’ve always been intrigued by business and I’m simply just motivated to conquer a new quest and pursue something different!\""

        "title": "2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup final",
        "text": "The 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup final was a Twenty20 International cricket match played at MCG in Melbourne, Australia on 13 November 2022 to determine the winner of the 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. It was played between England and Pakistan, with both the teams eyeing their second ICC Men's T20 World Cup title. England won the match by 5 wickets to win the title for the second time. Having also won the 2019 Cricket World Cup Final, England became the first men's team to hold the ODI World Cup and T20 World Cup titles at the same time.\nBackground.\nOriginally, the tournament was to be held in 2020, however, in July 2020, the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed that the tournament had been postponed, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In August 2020, the ICC also confirmed that Australia would host the rearranged tournament in 2022. On 15 November 2021, the ICC released the venues that would host matches across the tournament, with the Melbourne Cricket Ground being named as the venue for the finals. The England team wore black armbands to pay their respects to David English who died the day before.\nRoad to the final.\nBoth teams entered looking to win their second World T20 and their third ICC world championship. The game was also a rematch of the 1992 World Cup Final 30 years beforehand at the same venue, where a Pakistani team led by Imran Khan had been victorious. Both teams had also played a 7-match T20 series in Pakistan with England winning 4–3, with the Test portion of the tour (the first time England had played Tests while touring Pakistan since 2005) to take place after the World T20.\nPakistan.\nNo member of Pakistan's squad had previously played in the final of an ICC global tournament, with their closest connection being through fast bowler Shaheen Afridi, whose father-in-law, all-rounder Shahid Afridi, had been Man of the Match when Pakistan had bested Sri Lanka in the 2009 final at Lord's. However, their opening pair of captain Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan entered the tournament lauded as the best opening pair in international Twenty20 cricket.\nThey lost their first two opening matches in the Super 12s off the last ball, first against arch-rival India at the MCG and then against Zimbabwe in Perth, but then beat the Netherlands in Perth, South Africa in Sydney and Bangladesh in Adelaide to advance as Group 2 runner-up after the Netherlands upset South Africa. In their semifinal in Sydney, they beat New Zealand by 7 wickets with 5 balls to spare, with Rizwan being named Man of the Match scoring 57 off 43 balls.\nEngland.\nEngland fielded a number of players who had been part of their first-ever ODI World Cup victory on home soil in 2019. Wicketkeeper Jos Buttler had taken over as captain following Eoin Morgan's retirement, and England also returned with, among others, leg-spinner Adil Rashid and all-rounders Chris Woakes, Moeen Ali and Test captain Ben Stokes, the Man of the Match of their Super Over victory against New Zealand in the final at Lord's. Buttler, Stokes, and Rashid had also all played in the 2016 final in Kolkata, England's last appearance in a World T20 men's final, when they had lost to the West Indies following Carlos Brathwaite's four sixes off Stokes in the final over with 19 runs required. Other changes from the 2019 team included Alex Hales' recall following Morgan's retirement and Jonny Bairstow being ruled out with an injury, while Mark Wood was selected but ruled out due to injury with Chris Jordan taking his spot.\nFollowing an opening win against Afghanistan in Perth, they lost to Ireland at the MCG and then had their showdown with arch-rival, host and defending champion Australia at the same venue rained out, but they then beat New Zealand in Brisbane and then Sri Lanka in Sydney to advance past Australia on net run rate as Group 1 runner-up. In their semifinal, they then dispatched India by 10 wickets in Adelaide with 4 overs to spare as Buttler (80 not out) and Man of the Match Hales (86 not out) recorded England's highest-ever partnership in a men's World T20 match at 170 runs.\nMatch details.\nPakistan were asked to bat first and scored a total of 137 runs for the fall of 8 wickets. Shan Masood was Pakistan's top scorer with 38 runs. England's Sam Curran took 3 wickets for 12 runs, eventually earning both Man of the Match and Player of the Tournament honors.\nIn the second innings, England finished the six-over powerplay with 49 runs for 3 wickets. In the 13th over, the game changed when Shaheen Afridi slid forwards to take a catch off Shadab Khan, dismissing Harry Brook. Shaheen jarred his right knee in the process. With England needing 41 runs off five overs, Shaheen attempted to return for his third over after receiving some treatment but pulled out of his run-up once and then sending one slow delivery down to Moeen Ali before leaving the match with his injury. Iftikhar Ahmed replaced him as the bowler and proved to be expensive. Ben Stokes scored his maiden T20I fifty and then hit the winning run with six balls to spare. Stokes also became just the fifth player to record half centuries in multiple ICC World Cup (ODI or T20) finals after Australia's Adam Gilchrist, Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara, India's Gautam Gambhir and the West Indies' Marlon Samuels.\nFollowing the tournament, England's tour of Pakistan continued with the Test series, which England won 3–0. Stokes subsequently placed second in the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award voting behind UEFA Women's Euro 2022 winner and player of the tournament Beth Mead, having previously won the award in 2019.\nMatch officials.\nSource:\nScorecard.\nFall of wickets: 1/29 (Rizwan, 4.2 ov), 2/45 (Haris, 7.1 ov), 3/84 (Babar, 11.1 ov), 4/85 (Iftikhar, 12.2 ov), 5/121 (Masood, 16.3 ov), 6/123 (Shadab, 17.2 ov), 7/129 (Nawaz, 18.3 ov), 8/131 (Wasim, 19.3 ov)\nFall of wickets: 1/7 (Hales, 0.6 ov), 2/32 (Salt, 3.3 ov), 3/45 (Buttler, 5.3 ov), 4/84 (Brook, 12.3 ov), 5/132 (Ali, 18.2 ov)"

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. As of the next college basketball season in 2024–25, the Wildcats represent the University of Arizona in the NCAA Division I Big 12 Conference.\nArizona began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1904. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Arizona's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2022–23 season.\n1,000 Point Club.\nAs of the start of the 2023–24 Arizona season, 55 players have scored at least 1,000 points for the University of Arizona Men's Basketball team.

        "text": "The 1892 World Series followed the first split season in National League history, with the first-half champion Boston Beaneaters (102–48) playing the second-half champion Cleveland Spiders (93–56) in a best-of-nine postseason series to determine the overall champion of the 1892 baseball season. After the first game ended in a 0–0 tie due to darkness, Boston won the next five games to win the championship.\nContemporary newspaper reports referred to the games as the \"world's championship series\" or \"World's Series\". This was the last of the pre-modern-era World Series, and followed similar annual postseason competitions held from 1884 to 1890 between the champions of the National League and the American Association (which collapsed after the 1891 season). Later, the Temple Cup would be awarded to the winner of an annual postseason series between National League teams, from 1894 to 1897.\nBackground.\nBoston manager Frank Selee worried that late-October weather conditions would lead to postponements and low attendance. Cleveland's player-manager Patsy Tebeau suggested that \"the [Boston] Beaneaters fear the humiliation of possible defeat.\" Tebeau told \"Sporting Life\" that the cold weather was a \"dodge … simply an excuse to avoid playing Cleveland.\"\nBookies had the Spiders as the favorite, due to their pitching staff. Cy Young had gone 36–12 in 49 starts, with a 1.93 earned-run average. Meanwhile, Boston star Mike \"King\" Kelly had a batting average of only .189 for the year, and was described as \"one of the biggest failures of the base ball season.\"\nSeries summary.\n\"Boston won the series, 5–0–1.\"\nHugh Duffy of Boston batted .462 with nine runs batted in and six extra-base hits including a home run.\nHad the series required more than six games to complete, the remaining games would have been played in New York City.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nThe first game, which had started at three o'clock, had gone 11 scoreless innings when it was stopped at five o'clock due to darkness.\nGame 4.\nAfter a travel day for the teams, the series moved to Boston with the Beaneaters leading, two games to none.\nGame 5.\nJohn Clarkson started for Cleveland in place of Cy Young, who complained of a \"lame arm\".\nGame 6.\nAfter an off-day (professional baseball games were not allowed on Sundays in Boston until 1929) the Beaneaters won their fifth game of the series to capture the championship. The 13 players on their roster split $1000 prize money.\nAftermath.\nThe National League abolished the split season format for 1893, and did not play another split season until , which was caused by a players' strike.\nMultiple participants in the series were later inducted to the National Baseball Hall of Fame:\nJohn Clarkson had started the season with the Beaneaters, and signed with the Spiders after being released at the end of June. Pitcher Lee Viau also played for both Boston and Cleveland during 1892.\nThe Beaneaters were later known as the Doves (1907–1910) and the Rustlers (1911) before adopting the nickname of \"Braves\" in 1912. The franchise relocated to Milwaukee in 1953, and then moved to Atlanta in 1966, where they remain members of the National League as the Atlanta Braves. The Spiders' final season was 1899, when they compiled a record of 20–134 (establishing a longstanding record for the worst major league season) after ownership moved their best players to the St. Louis Cardinals, and were one of four teams contracted out of the National League when the league reduced its size to eight teams prior to the season."

Many of its buildings are listed by Historic England such as the grade II The Rugby Tavern. It was renamed Rugby Street in 1936 or 1937. In the post-war period, number 18 was the home to many creative people and the house where Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath spent their wedding night.\nLocation.\nRugby Street runs between Lamb's Conduit Street in the west and the junction of Great James Street and Millman Street in the east, in the Bloomsbury district of the London Borough of Camden. An alley known as Emerald Court joins the south side of the street to Emerald Street.\nHistory.\nChapel Street, sometimes spelled Chaple Street, was built on part of eight acres of land given to Rugby School in 1567 by Lawrence Sheriff, the school's founder. It forms part of the Rugby Estate which was laid out for development in the 1680s and let to Sir William Milman after whom nearby Millman Street is named.\nIt began to be built around 1700 and was completed around 1721. The street was named after the Episcopal Chapel of St John, a Church of England chapel on the corner with Millman Street which was already in existence when Chapel Street began to be developed. The chapel was later demolished and Rugby Chambers built on the site in 1867.\nThe street was renamed Rugby Street in 1936 or 1937.\nBuildings.\nThe street contains a number of listed buildings such as the grade II listed The Rugby Tavern on the corner with Great James Street which was created in the mid-nineteenth century by the joining of two houses, one from each street. Numbers 10 to 16 and 18 on the north side are also listed, as are numbers 7, 9, and 13 on the south side. Pevsner comments on the sensitive restoration of 10-16 by Rugby School in 1981 and the railings and carved doorcase of number 12.\nTo the rear and under number 13, formerly French's Dairy, lies the White Conduit head which supplied water to the Greyfriars Monastery in Newgate Street and which has been dated to 1258 or earlier. A plaque at the front notes the fact."

However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Syracuse's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

        "text": "Robert J. Wheeler (7 January 1931 – 13 April 2021) was an American ice hockey left wing who helped Brown reach its first and only (as of 2020) national championship game in 1951.\nCareer.\nWheeler grew up in Wakefield but was sent to Malden Catholic High School for a Catholic education at the insistence of his mother. At Malden Wheeler became a star on the ice, leading his team in scoring during his senior season and helped the Lancers go on a tremendous run in the state tournament. After defeating cross-town rival Malden High School in the semifinal in front of a packed house at the Boston Garden, MC won the Massachusetts state championship over Arlington High. The win gave Malden Catholic a berth into the regional tournament where the team continued to win and captured the New England Championship with Wheeler finishing as the top scorer in all of New England.\nWheeler began attending Brown University in 1948 and made an impact on the ice hockey team the following year. Wheeler helped the Bears win their first league championship in almost 50 years and set a program record with 11 wins. As a junior he nearly doubled his goal total, finishing with 33, setting another program record. Brown won its second Pentagonal League championship (the last time Brown won a conference title as of 2020) and finished the regular season with a 17–5 record. Brown received the top eastern seed and made its first appearance in the NCAA tournament where they dominated defending champion Colorado College 8–4 in the first game. The Bears' luck ran out in the final and they were completely swamped by Michigan, being outshot 20–52 in the game and losing 1–7. Wheeler assisted on Brown's only goal of the match.\nIn his senior season Wheeler kept scoring for the Bears but several graduations in 1951 caused Brown to slip just enough to miss the tournament. Wheeler finished the year with 36 goals in 22 games, a new program record that stands as of 2020, and 86 goals for his career (another program record as of 2020). He was selected as an AHCA First Team All-American and was one of the top goal-scorers in the nation.\nAfter graduating from Brown Wheeler joined the army and served in Korea. After returning he began a career working for IBM. In the fall of 1955, Wheeler attended a training camp for the US National team for the upcoming Winter Olympics and felt that he had a good chance to make the squad. He went to his manager at IBM and requested a 6-month leave to participate but, having worked at the company for only 3 months, Wheeler was denied and his Olympic hopes ended. The missed opportunity remained one of Wheeler's biggest regrets.\nWheeler was inducted into the Brown Athletic Hall of Fame in 1971 and the Massachusetts Hockey Hall of Fame in 2007.\nLater in life, Wheeler became an outstanding golfer under the tutelage of William “Wild Bill” Ezinicki and went on to win the club championship at New Seabury Country Club as well as the senior club championship at Essex County Club.\nPersonal.\nWheeler moved to Hamilton in 1969, where he and his wife Diane raised their five children. His oldest son, Bob Jr., played college hockey at Harvard and also played on a team that made the championship game in 1983."

The league was founded in 2017 to unite regional senior leagues into a system similar to the Canadian Lacrosse Association structure of men's Senior A and Senior B box lacrosse teams. In 2021 there were 52 total teams playing in 17 regional leagues. The Seneca Marksmen were the most last IBLA champions, defeating the Grand Rapids Grizzlies in Lakeland, Florida on September 19, 2021. \nThe league ended in controversy when it was revealed some games leading up to the 2021 championship game had been miscounted. Additional conversations from teams meeting at the 2021 championships uncovered repeated inconsistencies in financial support from the league itself. The outcome of the controversy saw all league teams leaving for the Great Plains Box Lacrosse League (now the Box Lacrosse League), The North American Box Lacrosse League, or returning to independent operations. \nHistory.\n2017.\nColorado formed the first organized regional box lacrosse league with four teams after initial in-state competition in 2016. Seeing the success of Colorado's competition model, RBLL - Minnesota was formed using the same structure. The RBLL - Portland was also added with the Portland River Monsters and Beaverton Mountaineers, but both teams folded after one season with the first bit of controversy for the IBLA. The 2017 champions were the Parker Rangers, who took down the Hastings Walleye to capture the inaugural league title.\n2018.\nRBLL - New England and RBLL - New Jersey began play on the east coast under the IBLA structure. The midwest was organized into RBLL - Ohio and RBLL - Missouri. The second league title was awarded to the Cambridge Nor'easters after defeating the Denver Mile High Stars.\n2019.\nThe IBLA expanded again, adding new competition on the west coast in the form of RBLL - Arizona and RBLL - California. Additional midwest talent was also brought into the fold with RBLL - Nebraska. The Maine Northmen came out on top in the playoffs, beating the Louisville Canards 17 - 14 in the final game. \n2020.\nDue to the spread of COVID-19, most teams faced shortened season schedules and the league championship tournament location was moved from Boston to Pittsburgh. By the end of the summer, 10 regions were able to crown division champions. Teams from these 10 regions were invited to compete for the IBLA Nationals league championship. For group play the teams were divided into the Steel and Maple groups. The San Diego Whalers, Grand Rapids Grizzlies, Mooncrest Munitionz, Aksarben Stampede, and Louisville Canards made up the Steel group. The Maple group consisted of the Maine Northmen, Philadelphia Phunk, Charlotte Reapers, Albany Hyenas, and Minneapolis Wheat Kings.\nA league milestone occurred on September 17 with the first IBLA player taken in the National Lacrosse League Entry Draft. Mooncrest Munitionz Forward Larson Sundown was drafted by the New York Riptide in round 2 with the 36th overall pick. Sundown is transferring to RIT for the 2021 NCAA Lacrosse season, meaning New York will retain his rights through the 2021-2022 season. The 2020 IBLA season concluded with 25 playoff games from September 25 – 27. For the fourth year in a row, the championship matchup was played by two teams having never reached the title game. In the lowest scoring championship game to date, the Phildalphia Phunk outlasted the Minneapolis Wheat Kings 9 - 5 to capture their first title. \n2021.\n2021 saw the return of several teams that were on hiatus in 2020 due to local COVID-19 restrictions as well as continued league expansion. The newly formed RBLL - Louisiana was formed by teams in Baton Rouge and New Orleans, RBLL - Texas placed two franchises in Austin, RBLL - Florida hosted teams in Orlando and Tampa, RBLL - Maryland included four teams, and the RBLL- Empire South formed by splitting three teams off from an RBLL - New Jersey that added two expansion teams. In total, 22 different states fielded an IBLA team in 2021. The 2021 playoffs took place September 17 through September 19 at the 8,178 seat RP Funding Center in Lakeland, Florida. Painters tape was used to line the arena and refs decided that getting paid was overrated. \nControversy arose in the second of two semi-final nationals games with the Tampa Bay Twisters taking on the Grand Rapids Grizzlies. The game concluded after the Twisters scored a sudden-death goal in second overtime to secure a seat in the finals. The League even published this game result on its social media channels and announcing the final matchup would be between the Twisters and Seneca Marksmen, only to go back just before the final and realize they had miscounted the number of goals scored in the game. As such, under further review, the Grizzlies were awarded the final spot in the finals. Some Grizzlies players having perceived from the errant record-keeping that they lost their semi-final matchup had left the arena after their game and were unable to return in time for the championship game. Shorthanded, the team fell to an overpowering Marksmen team that had not lost all season (regular, postseason, or nationals). It was later revealed that this Tampa Bay Twisters game was not the only game at the tournament to be miscounted.\nRules.\nIBLA rules are nearly identical to NLL rules with minor adjustments to account for slight arena dimension variations.\nNotable League Rules:"

Unlike Test matches, ODIs consist of one inning per team, having a limit in the number of overs, currently 50 overs per innings – although in the past this has been 55 or 60 overs. ODI cricket is List-A cricket, so statistics and records set in ODI matches also count toward List-A records.

This partnership will continue until one of them is dismissed, retires or the innings comes to a close.\nHighest partnerships by wicket.\nA wicket partnership describes the number of runs scored before each wicket falls. The first wicket partnership is between the opening batsmen and continues until the first wicket falls. The second wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the number three batsman. This partnership continues until the second wicket falls. The third wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the new batsman. This continues down to the tenth wicket partnership. When the tenth wicket has fallen, there is no batsman left to partner so the innings is closed.\nHighest partnerships by runs.\nThe highest ODI partnership by runs for any wicket is held by the West Indian pairing of Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels who put together a second wicket partnership of 372 runs during the 2015 Cricket World Cup against Zimbabwe in February 2015. This broke the record of 331 runs set by Indian pair of Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid against New Zealand in 1999\nUmpiring records.\nMost matches umpired.\nAn umpire in cricket is a person who officiates the match according to the \"Laws of Cricket\". Two umpires adjudicate the match on the field, whilst a third umpire has access to video replays, and a fourth umpire looks after the match balls and other duties. The records below are only for on-field umpires.\nRudi Koertzen of South Africa holds the record for the most ODI matches umpired with 209. The current active Aleem Dar is currently at 208 matches. They are followed by New Zealand's Billy Bowden who officiated in 200 matches. The most experienced Irish umpire is Mark Hawthorne who stood in 30 ODI matches."

        "text": "CONMEBOL Copa América (CONMEBOL America Cup), known until 1975 as the South American Football Championship (Campeonato Sudamericano de Fútbol in Spanish and Copa Sul-Americana de Futebol in Portuguese), is the main men's soccer tournament contested among national teams from CONMEBOL. It is the oldest international soccer competition. The competition determines the champion of South America. Since the 1990s, teams from North America and Asia have also been invited to participate.\nHistory.\nEarly history on pay-per-view (1995-1999).\nMatches in 1995 were only offered by Prime Network to Americans via pay-per-view or in closed-circuit theaters.\nIn 1997, seventeen out of 26 matches, including all elimination games, were offered through satellite distributors PrimeStar and Fox Sports Direct. The other eight first-round games and third-place match could be seen via satellite on Fox Sports Americas. The cost was $12.95 for each first-round game and $15.95 for each of the others. Commentary was made available both in English and Spanish.\nTwo years later, Fox Sports offered 17 games from Paraguay on pay-per-view at $15 per match or $100 for the whole tourney. The final however, between Brazil and Uruguay was made available on Fox Sports Español.\nUnivision, GOL TV, and Traffic Sports (2001-2011).\n2001 saw a breakthrough when Univision and cable cousin Galavisión provided coverage of Copa América to broadcast television for the first time. Univision averaged 1.4 million viewers for their efforts. Univision was once again the exclusive American television home for the Copa in 2004, where the average improved slightly to 1.75 million.\nGOL TV acquired the English-language rights for Copa América 2007. This came at the same time that the United States was making its first appearance in the tournament since 1995. Meanwhile, Univision's average audience grew again, to 2.5 million. Not only that, but they offered online streaming for the first time.\nAfter ESPN tried and failed to acquire the 2011 Copa América English-language broadcasting rights for their then-nascent ESPN3 streaming service, Traffic Sports swooped in and put all the games on YouTube for free. While Univision's ratings fell from 2007, they still attracted 2 million-plus viewers for the semis and final.\nbeIN Sports and fuboTV (2015).\nbeIN served as Copa América's mainstream English-language home in 2015. This consequently, also took away Univision's Spanish-language rights. Univision, however, would return come \nCopa América Centenario one year later. fuboTV meanwhile, offered fans a chance to watch the tournament via streaming. fuboTV accounted for 50,000 subscribers. Unfortunately for beIN, they were only available 17 million homes at the time, which is only 14.6% of American TV households. Despite beIN's limited reach, they still managed to snag 1.5 million viewers for the final.\nFox Sports and Univision (2016).\nFox Sports beat out both ESPN and beIN for the English-language broadcasting rights to Copa América Centenario in 2016. This meant that the first time ever, most Americans had the ability to watch Copa América. Fox Sports made the matches available on FS1, FS2, FX, and the over-the-air Fox network. An average of 4 million viewers tuned in.\nESPN+ and Telemundo (2019).\nIn 2019, ESPN's streaming service ESPN+ acquired both the English-language and Portuguese-language rights for the 2019 Copa América. Telemundo meanwhile, Telemundo secured the Spanish-language U.S. TV rights.\nFox Sports and Univision (2021).\nUnivision through its sports programming division TUDN, retained Spanish-language rights for the 2021 edition. TUDN will make matches available on Galavisión and TUDN and on over-the-air Univision and UniMás. English-language rights return to Fox Sports after a six-year deal until 2026 that will allow them to air the next two championships."

Founded in 1992, AHF is a member of European Handball Federation (EHF) and the International Handball Federation (IHF).\nThe organization was created with the aim of developing and popularizing handball in the country, training highly qualified sports professionals and ensuring their successful performance in the international arena, etc. To achieve its goals, the organization organizes various sports events, prepares the national teams of Azerbaijan to participate in sports events and many others for the development of handball in Azerbaijan.\nPrehistory.\nThe history of the sports game handball dates back to 1898. However, research suggests that the history of handball origin dates back to an early time.\nThe first attempt to introduce handball in Azerbaijan was made back in 1926-1928, but other sports were preferred in the country at that time. For the first time, the spread of handball in Azerbaijan took place in 1955. However, it is very widespread among military athletes. As a result, handball becomes one of the main sports of the Armed Forces.\nIn 1956, the first Soviet handball championship was held in Vilnius, in which the team of the Baku Armed District represented Azerbaijan. The team failed to reach the final. In 1956, a course on the game of handball was organized.\nIn October 1958, Baku hosted the first international handball match between the national team of the capital and the team of Tbilisi, in which the team from Baku won. From 1956 to 1961, a number of handball matches were held in the Soviet Union, in which Baku teams took part.\nIn 1963-1969, the \"Dynamo\" team successfully competed in the highest league of the USSR championship. The team was among the strongest handball teams. In 1965, the Azerbaijani women's handball team began competing in the championships of the Soviet Union under the name “Spartak”. The Spartak women's team won 5 times 1970-1974. The years 1974-1976 were the heyday of handball in Azerbaijan. Handball competitions began to be held in the districts of the country. From 1976 to 1990, men's and women's handball teams from Baku began to take an active part in competitions.\nSince 1991, the handball teams \"Aipara\", \"Baku\", \"Haiita\", \"Abu\" began to represent Azerbaijan at the international level.\nIn order to further develop handball in the country, the Azerbaijan Handball Federation was founded in 1992."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Racers represent Murray State University in the NCAA Division I Missouri Valley Conference.\nMurray State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1925. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Murray State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2022 OVC tournament."

After graduating from Hibbing High School he joined the navy and served for two years. After returning home he worked as a miner for two years before getting his chance at college hockey. Denver University began its ice hockey program in 1949 and Miller was in the first class of players to be invited to join the team. He didn't play on the varsity squad during his freshman season as the NCAA had rules stipulating that students were only permitted to play three year on any varsity team, but by the start of his sophomore year, Miller was with the big squad. Miller was one of the reasons why Denver nearly tripled its win total in the second season and then finished with an 18–6–1 mark in his junior season. Denver narrowly missed out on making its first NCAA tournament appearance in 1952 but Miller did receive recognition as one of the top defensemen that season with his selection as an AHCA First Team All-American, the first in the history of the program.\nAfter leaving Denver in 1953, Miller returned to Minnesota and worked as a teacher and ice hockey coach in Baudette and Wayzata for over 30 years. Miller continued to play throughout the 1950s, winning the national senior amateur championship with the Minneapolis Bungalow team in 1957. A year later Miller played for the US national team at the 1958 Ice Hockey World Championships but finished disappointed in 5th-place.\nLate in life, Miller was inducted into both the Hibbing Hall of Fame (1996) and the Denver Athletic Hall of Fame (2000)."

The club is located on the southern edge of the township of Barwon Heads and comprises an eighteen-hole links style championship course as well as a nine-hole 3-par course, tennis courts and a clubhouse with accommodation built in the 1920s.\nHistory.\nThe Barwon Heads Golf Club was founded in 1907 and was initially a nine hole course located to the north of the township of Barwon Heads. In 1920 the club moved to its current location on the southern edge of the Barwon Heads township on the Bass Strait coast line. The links style course was designed by Victor East, the then professional of the Royal Melbourne Golf Club, the plowing and shaping of the course was done with horse drawn implements and the course was planted with couch grass obtained from the Royal Melbourne Golf Club.\nThe clubhouse was built in 1923-4 by John Smith of Meredith for £12,500 to the designs of the architectural firm Klingender &amp; Hamilton, by 1925 the club has spent almost £20,000 on the clubhouse including furniture and plants. The clubhouse has subsequently undergone a number of renovations, it is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.\nIn 1961 the club built a nine-hole 3-par course, it was laid out by Legh Winser.\nFrom 2005 Neil Crafter and Paul Mogford of Crafter and Mogford Golf Strategists were engaged by the club to enhance the championship course. At the same time the 3-par course was demolished to make way for a flood detention basin to provide the club with an irrigation source, a new nine-hole 3-par course was designed by Crafter and Mogford.\nChampionship course.\nThe championship course is an eighteen-hole links style course located in the sand dunes near the ocean, the first six holes are to the east of the clubhouse and with the remaining twelve to the west. It has been ranked the 20th best golf course in Australia and one of the finest links courses."

The women's tournament was played as an official event and the men's tournament as an invitational event. This was the first time that men's and women's field lacrosse were played in a six-a-side format in a multi-sport competition. This was also an absolute debut of a men's tournament in a World Games programme, as in 2017 women played the traditional lacrosse discipline for the first time in the history of the World Games. The games in 2022 were played in the sixes format, with teams of six players per side, reduced field size, and shorter games as compared to the parent field lacrosse format, which was conducive to daily tournament play. The game was played in eight-minute quarters and emphasized speed and efficiency.\nQualification.\nA total of 8 teams for each gender competed in the lacrosse event at the 2022 World Games.\nQualification for the men's tournament of the 2022 World Games was based primarily on final placement at the 2018 World Lacrosse Championship. The Iroquois team, who took third at the 2018 championship, were initially disqualified as the Iroquois confederacy does not have a National Olympic Committee; after the ruling was overturned, the Irish team vacated their place in their favour. Lacrosse was invented by Indigenous nations including the Iroquois or Haudenosaunee peoples, and the game has spiritual significance for them.\nFor the women's tournament, the 2021 World Lacrosse Women's World Championship was supposed to be the basis for qualification. Like their men's counterpart, the Iroquois women's national lacrosse team was eligible to qualify. However, the Women's World Championship was postponed to July 2022.\nResults.\nMen's tournament.\nGroup A\nGroup B\nWomen's tournament.\nGroup A\nGroup B"

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. As of the next college basketball season in 2024–25, the Sooners represent the University of Oklahoma in the NCAA Division I Southeastern Conference.\nOklahoma began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1907. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Oklahoma's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "World Basketball Manager (WBM) is a series of basketball management simulation video games, originally developed and published by Greek studio Icehole Games. The game began in 1998, known as \"Basketball Manager\". In 2004, the series was renamed \"World Basketball Manager\". The latest version, titled \"World Basketball Manager X\" was released on May 23, 2019.\nMain series.\n\"Basketball Manager\".\n\"Basketball Manager (1998)\".\nThe original \"Basketball Manager\" was released in 1998, created by an internal development team at Volax Interactive calling themselves \"icehole\". The game was designed by 2 people, who have since cited football management simulation video games, such as \"Championship Manager\", \"Player Manager\" and \"Premier Manager\" as their main influence. \"Basketball Manager\" featured only the Greek League and 2 European tournaments, and was released for the Greek market.\n\"Basketball Manager 2000\".\nA second, improved and expanded version of \"Basketball Manager\" was released in 2000. This version included 6 European basketball leagues (by adding the French, German, Italian, Spanish and Israeli leagues to the existing Greek one) as well as every international European tournament held at that time, while also featuring new graphics.\n\"World Basketball Manager\".\n\"World Basketball Manager\" (2004).\nWith the success of the latest \"Basketball Manager\" game, the development team behind the \"BM\" project at Volax left the company and founded Metal Fin, but insisted on keeping \"icehole\" as the collective name of the team behind the next game's development. After securing funding, which enabled developers to work full-time on the next title, \"World Basketball Manager\" was released in 2004. The game featured 65 international basketball tournaments and a total of 94 countries, making it the only basketball management game at the time to include basketball teams outside of the NBA. \"WBM\" featured gameplay inspired by football management simulation video games, such as \"Championship Manager\", and became well-known for its realistic match simulation and challenging AI, which was based on a combination of a genetic algorithm and deterministic logic.\n\"World Basketball Manager 2005\".\nThe 2005 version of \"WBM\" was released in 2005 in China and Germany, each country receiving its own localized version, while existing \"WBM\" players could download the game as a free upgrade. The game was practically a re-release of the 2004 version, featuring the same graphics and gameplay mechanics but with updated team rosters corresponding to the 2004/05 season.\n\"World Basketball Manager 2007\".\n\"World Basketball Manager 2007\" was the third entry in the \"WBM\" series. The game received an international release on 22 February 2007, with BHV handling distribution in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, while the Greek version was published by MLS in both Greece and Cyprus.\nThe game featured an expanded database over its predecessors, with 64 national and international tournaments, 655 teams, 10.000 basketball players and 1.000 managers, although no improvements were made to the game's graphics. The game further featured a new training system with 106 different training routines, improved AI, faster game progression algorithms, more realistic free agent pricing, improved player creation and career progress and a simulation of the NBA draft taking place at the beginning of every season. Players could create their own manager profile and manage various club departments (including medical, training facilities and youth academy), transfers, contracts, training and actual coaching during games. A feedback system was implemented, including feedback from the press, fans, players and administration, allowing players to receive job offers from more prestigious basketball clubs and even national basketball teams.\n\"World Basketball Manager 2008\".\n\"World Basketball Manager 2008\" was the fourth entry in the \"WBM\" series. Icehole added new features and improvements to the \"WBM\" formula, most notably pre-season training camp selection, which influences the overall development of players for the entire season; and mid-season sponsorship contracts. Other improvements include a revamped training system, allowing players to improve the team's zone defending or cohesion through training; the addition of \"Form\" in the players' list of attributes; an option for database size affecting game speed and realism by loading one of two available database choices; opponent scouting reports; and the ability to start a new career as a national team manager.\nThe game introduced new leagues from Australia, Brazil, France, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal and Turkey, and included support for 8 languages, including English, French, Italian, German, Greek, Lithuanian, Portuguese and Spanish.\n\"World Basketball Manager 2009\".\n\"World Basketball Manager 2009\" was the fifth game in the \"WBM\" series. This version added 22 new tournaments, raising the total number to 89, with 852 teams, 10.000 basketball players and 1.000 managers. New features and improvements included an improved match algorithm and revamped interface, overall improved control of the player's club financial situation with the ability to issue demands to club Administration, a number of bonuses for managerial achievements, such as team-building and cohesive make-up of club rosters, improved transfer algorithms and the ability to cancel time-outs during games. Furthermore, Icehole included two more languages (Serbian and Turkish), raising the total number to 10, while also reaching an agreement with IQ Publishing to handle distribution of the game in Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.\nOn 9 September 2009, Icehole announced a free mini-game based on the EuroBasket 2009 tournament in Poland, featuring all 16 participating teams (as well as all European national teams already featured \"WBM 2009\"). The game featured two game modes (a Tournament mode for teams already qualified for the tournament, and a Qualification mode for all other European teams) and a new data editor for players to make changes to the teams' rosters.\n\"World Basketball Manager 2010\".\n\"World Basketball Manager 2010\" was released as a free upgrade of the series' previous installment. Adding no new features or mechanics, the 2010 version would update all tournament formats to their 2009/10 status, expanding the game database even further to include over 12.500 players, 1.400 managers and 975 teams. It was also the first in the series to be made available on Steam.\nThis would become the standard format for \"WBM\" games for the next 5 years (with season 2015 being the last update the game received), until the release of \"World Basketball Manager 2\". Another free mini-game, this time based on the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup, with a similar premise to the EuroBasket 2009 edition, was released in September 2014, featuring all 24 participating teams, tournament venues, drawn Groups and national team rosters.\n\"World Basketball Manager 2\".\nOn February 2, 2017, Icehole announced the release \"World Basketball Manager 2\", a new entry in the \"WBM\" series and the first game of the franchise to be available on Mac. Development on the game had started in 2013, with the game's release being planned for the summer of 2014, but after an unsuccessful Indiegogo campaign to raise 25,000€, the game was delayed until its 2017 release date.\n\"WBM2\" marked the departure of the series from its previous text-based visual presentation, introducing a new visual 2D match engine, an improved and more legible user interface as well as a number of improvements in the technological area and AI. The game's database included over 13.500 players, 1.100 basketball teams and more than 100 Club and National Team tournaments, while the game featured support for 12 languages upon its release.\n\"World Basketball Manager X\".\n\"World Basketball Manager X\" is the latest game in the \"WBM\" series, released on May 23, 2019 for Microsoft Windows, with a MacOS version following in 2020. \"WBMX\" is based on the \"WBM2\" engine, introducing several improvements and updates over its predecessor.\nOther games.\nSpin-offs.\n\"World Basketball Manager Tycoon\".\nOn June 4, 2013 Icehole Games announced the release of the series' first (and to this day, only) spin-off title, \"World Basketball Manager Tycoon\". The game is a departure from the strict management simulation format established by the other \"WBM\" games, instead opting for a mixture between the former and a tycoon game experience. In July 2014, Icehole announced that the game would receive a physical release in Poland, distributed by IQ Publishing.\n\"WBM Tycoon\" features over 100 national and international competitions, 1000+ clubs (including national teams), 12.500+ basketball players and over 1200 managers, sharing the same database and match AI with the regular \"WBM\" game series. Maintaining much of the managerial aspects found in the previous games, \"WBM Tycoon\" players are further tasked with successfully building and maintaining a basketball franchise through business ownership as an entrepreneur. This includes managing the club's finances, facilities and team overall winning form.\nLicensing.\nDue to the absence of any licensing, each \"WBM\" release includes \"unofficial\" league, club, player and manager names, with clubs either using obvious city names (such as Barcelona being called \"Barcelonia\" or \"Regal Barca\"), nicknames (such as AEK Athens being called \"Enosi\"), or misspelled names (such as the Miami Heat being called \"Muami Hiat\"). However, a community-maintained database has been created by fans of the game, called the \"Real Names &amp; Images Project\", which includes real team logos, player and manager photos, more than 9600 real names of basketball players, 650 actual team names and 1000 actual manager names from 194 countries. In order for the database to be updated every season, the users have created a network of researchers who update and make the data available for download through an unofficial, but condoned by Icehole \"Real Names Patch\"."

Bacuya, or \"Badak Cula Cahaya\". The horned rhino refers to an animal native to Indonesia. Bacuya appeared wearing a red and white Indonesian national team jersey.\nBacuya's philosophy is that of a young Javan rhinoceros who is very shy and reserved. Despite these characteristics, his curiosity compels him to run stoically into the field as if in search of something. Shades of green grass motivate him until he finds a ball. When something suddenly extraordinary happens, his horns light up with new colors.\nMusic.\nAfter previously \"Glorious\" became the official song for the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup, this song by the EDM music group from Indonesia named Weird Genius is again the official song for the 2023 FIFA U-17 World Cup.

        "text": "The 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup was the 23rd edition of the FIFA U-20 World Cup, the biennial international men's youth football championship contested by the under-20 national teams of the member associations of FIFA, since its inception in 1977 as the FIFA World Youth Championship. The official match ball used in the tournament was Adidas Oceaunz.\nThe tournament was held in Argentina, who had previously hosted in 2001. Indonesia had originally been set to host the competition, having been hosts of the cancelled 2021 edition, but their hosting rights were stripped on 29 March 2023 due to their refusal to host Israel. \nReigning champions Ukraine could not defend their title as they failed to qualify. Hosts Argentina were knocked out in the round of 16 after three wins in the group stage following a two-nil loss to Nigeria. The final was held on 11 June 2023, and Uruguay defeated Italy to become champions for the first time. It was the country's first world title since the men's senior in the 1950 FIFA World Cup.\nHost selection.\nFive bids to host the original 2021 tournament were submitted in 2019, and Indonesia was announced as the winning bidder on 24 October 2019. In December 2020, the 2021 event was postponed until 2023, with Indonesia remaining as host.\nHowever, Indonesia was stripped of hosting rights on 29 March 2023 due to its refusal to bring the Israel U-20 national team in. Peru, Argentina and Qatar confirmed their interest in hosting the tournament. On 30 March, Argentina became the only country to submit an official bid.\nOn 17 April 2023, at a press conference jointly held by economy minister Sergio Massa, tourism and sports minister Matías Lammens, and the president of the Argentine Football Association (AFA), Claudio Tapia, it was announced that Argentina would host the tournament, followed shortly after by a statement from FIFA confirming Argentina as the new hosts. Argentina will thus become the second nation to host the U-20 World Cup twice (having previously hosted it in 2001). Australia is the other nation that had hosted it twice (1981 and 1993).\nQualified teams.\nA total of 24 teams qualified for the final tournament. Teams qualified from six continental competitions.\nThe Dominican Republic and Israel made their debut in the competition; this was the Dominican Republic's first-ever qualification for a FIFA tournament. Having qualified for the 1970 FIFA World Cup via the Asian qualification, this was the first FIFA tournament for which Israel qualified as a European representative.\nArgentina qualified for the tournament as the host country in place of Indonesia, even though they originally had failed to qualify through the 2023 South American U-20 Championship. Indonesia had also failed to qualify for the competition and lost its automatic spot in the WC when the tournament was moved to Argentina.\nVenues.\nLa Plata, Mendoza, San Juan and Santiago del Estero were the four cities chosen to host the competition.\nDraw.\nThe draw took place at 16:00 CEST (11:00 ART host time) on 21 April 2023 at FIFA headquarters in Zürich, Switzerland. The twenty-four teams were drawn into six groups of four teams, with the hosts, Argentina, automatically seeded to Pot 1 and placed into the first position of Group A, while the remaining teams were seeded into their respective pots based on their results in the last five FIFA U-20 World Cups (more recent tournaments weighted more heavily) as follows:\nFurthermore, five bonus points were added to each of the six continental champions from the qualifying tournaments.\nThe draw started with teams from pot one being drawn first and placed in the first position of their groups (hosts Argentina automatically assigned to A1). Then were drawn the teams from pot 2, followed by pot 3 and pot 4, with each team also drawn to one of the positions within their group, No group could contain more than one team from each confederation. The ceremony was presented by Samantha Johnson and conducted by FIFA Director of Tournaments Jaime Yarza, with the former footballers Juan Pablo Sorín, from Argentina, and David Trezeguet, from France, acting as draw assistants.\nThe draw resulted in the following groups:\nMatch officials.\nA total of nineteen refereeing trios (a referee and two assistant referees), six support referees, and eighteen video assistant referees were appointed for the tournament. On 19 May, Swiss referee Sandro Schärer withdrew prior to the tournament due to an injury and was replaced by José María Sánchez Martínez.\nSquads.\nPlayers born between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2007 (inclusive) were eligible to compete in the tournament.\nEach team had to name a preliminary squad of between 22 and 50 players. From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 21 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers) by the FIFA deadline. Players in the final squad could be replaced by a player from the preliminary squad due to serious injury or illness up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team's first match.\nGroup stage.\nThe top two teams of each group and the four best third-placed teams advanced to the round of 16.\nAll times are in local, Argentina time ().\nTiebreakers.\nThe rankings of teams in each group were determined as follows (regulations Article 17.7):\nIf two or more teams were equal on the basis of the above three criteria, their rankings were determined by:\nGroup A.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup C.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup D.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup E.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup F.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nRanking of third-placed teams.\nThe four best third-placed teams from the six groups advanced to the knockout stage along with the six group winners and six runners-up.\nIn the next stage, the four third-placed teams were matched with the winners of groups A, B, C, and D according to the tournament regulations.\nKnockout stage.\nIn the knockout stage, if a match was level at the end of 90 minutes of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each). If still tied after extra time, the match would be decided by a penalty shoot-out.\nIn the round of 16, the four third-placed teams were matched with the winners of groups A, B, C, and D. The specific match-ups involving the third-placed teams depended on which four third-placed teams qualified for the round of 16:\nMarketing.\nDevelopment and preparation.\nIn early May 2023 - before the removal of Indonesia as the host, FIFA announced that the official song of the tournament would be \"Glorious\", performed by the Indonesian EDM group Weird Genius and featuring three other Indonesian stars: Lyodra Ginting, Tiara Andini and Ziva Magnolya. The remixed version of thesong would later being used at the 2023 FIFA U-17 World Cup held later that year in Indonesia.\nBroadcasting rights.\nLive stream is available on FIFA+, while in Indonesia, available on Moji and Vidio, including replays.\nControversies.\nProtests against Israel's participation in Indonesia and Indonesia's removal as host.\nBy finishing second in the 2022 UEFA European Under-19 Championship, Israel qualified to the U-20 World Cup for the first time in history. However, Israel's participation is subject to political controversy due to Indonesia having the world's largest Muslim population and the two countries having no formal relations owing to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Given this, Indonesian Minister of Youth and Sports Zainudin Amali stated that FIFA required any country qualified for the U-20 World Cup shall play, and that the local security officers will provide security for the Israeli team.\nDespite attempts to confirm Israel's participation, Israel's involvement led to Indonesia coming under scrutiny by various pro-Palestinian organisations. Various Islamist organisations in Indonesia have threatened Israeli players, stating that the Israeli team is not welcome in Indonesia. Meanwhile Nahdlatul Ulama figures such as its leader, Yahya Cholil Staquf and Indonesian Minister of Religious Affairs, Yaqut Cholil Qoumas voiced support for Israel's participation. However, one of the six regional heads who had signed the original agreement on willingness to be the host for the world cup, Governor of Bali, I Wayan Koster as well as non-signatory Governor of Central Java (where Solo is located), Ganjar Pranowo, both members of the ruling party PDIP, stated their objection of hosting the Israeli team, citing 'anti-colonial' stances of Sukarno rather than religious ones.\nThe Palestinian Ambassador to Indonesia Zuhair Al-Shun said that his country has no objections to Indonesia's hosting of the tournament, despite Israel's qualification.\nOn 28 March 2023, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, in a break with his party, voiced his own support to Israeli participation, and implored his people to not mix politics and sport. The Mayor of Solo, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, Joko Widodo's son, expressed disappointment with the governor's decision and willingness to hold match draw in Solo, and Bandung. A last minute effort was made to rescue Indonesia's role as host while still acknowledging the country's concerns, but on 29 March, FIFA officially stripped Indonesia as host for the tournament, stating \"current circumstances\" as the reasoning without specifying the details."

        "title": "Table tennis rubber",
        "text": "Table tennis rubber is a type of rubber used as covering on a racket in table tennis. Modern table tennis rubber is usually composed of two layers: a layer of foam (\"sponge\") underneath and a layer of actual rubber on the surface. There are four common types of table tennis rubbers: short pips, long pips, antispin, and inverted. The thickness and density of the sponge layer underneath also affects how the rubber will handle the ball.\nBecause of the large variety of table tennis rubbers, there are a larger variety of playing styles in table tennis than in other racket sports.\nHistory.\nRubber was first used in table tennis with the rise of hard racket paddles in the 1930s; the rubber consisted of short pimples over a wooden blade. In the 1950s, the sponge racket was introduced. It had a layer of foam underneath the layer of rubber. The foam helps provide more spin and speed. The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) regulated the thickness of the foam + rubber layer to a maximum of 4 mm ( inch) thick, which has been the regulation in table tennis since.\nUntil 1986, players often had the same color of rubber on both sides of their paddle so that opponents could not tell which side of the paddle was being used. On July 1, 1986, two years before table tennis's introduction to the Olympics, the ITTF made it a rule that competition paddles had to have black rubber on one side and red rubber on the other side.\nTypes of rubber.\nTable tennis rubber has four common types: inverted and short pips rubber are primarily offensive, while long pips and antispin are primarily defensive. The word \"pip\" refers to the usually conic-shaped raised bumps on top of the rubber in short and long pips rubber or the bumps on the inside attached to the foam on inverted or antispin rubber.\nInverted.\nInverted rubber is an offensive rubber and the most popular type of rubber. They are smooth on the outside, leaving the pips on the inside touching the foam, which is why it is called inverted. Inverted rubber's wide variety of speeds and spins make it a favorite among players. Manufacturers will provide speed and spin ratings to differentiate their type of inverted rubber from others. The faster the speed rating, the harder it is to control.\nTensioned rubber.\nBefore 2007, professional players often used speed glue on their inverted rubber to increase both speed and spin. After the ITTF banned speed glue due to health concerns, manufacturers have employed different methods to create inverted rubber with similar effects of speed glue. These new types of inverted rubber are called tensioned rubber, also called high tension, pre-tensed, or tensor rubber. They come in two types: mechanically tensioned rubber and chemically tensioned rubber. The two types differ mainly in the manufacturing process; mechanically tensioned rubber is made by gluing the rubber topsheet in a vacuum to cause the rubber to expand, and chemically tensioned rubber soaks the bottom foam layer in chemicals that cause the same effect as speed glue on the foam, but lasts longer.\nShort pips.\nShort pips rubber, also called pips out rubber, is a more controlled attack rubber that provides more speed but less spin to an attack than inverted rubber. Due to the small contact surface with the ball, short pips rubber is not easily affected by the opponent's spin; instead, it will knock a ball away. Therefore, the rubber is usually used for blocking, hitting, and counterattack strokes.\nLong pips.\nLong pips rubber is a defensive rubber. As its name suggests, the rubber has longer pips than short pips, and usually it also has thinner pips. The flexibility of the pips creates a low friction effect. As a result, it provides little spin because the spinning ball slips on the rubber. When provided with a heavy topspin ball from an opponent's rubber, the opponent's spin is returned. However, if the opponent sends backspin, the spin is again returned but will be topspin to the opponent which can cause confusion as inverted rubber or short pips rubber would return backspin for the same stroke. This is called \"spin reversal\" though in fact the spin does not reverse from the point of view of the bystander. The occasion when spin reverses is actually when both players are executing backspin or both executing topspin.\nAntispin.\nAntispin rubber is a defensive rubber with a smooth surface and very soft sponge. Due to the soft sponge, this rubber dampens speed of the ball and returns the ball at a low speed. It is usually used by defensive players on one side of their racket only. Unlike inverted rubber, it does not grip the ball, so opponents' balls are returned with little spin. However, against heavy spin, antispin rubber will return the ball with an opposite spin, similar to long pips.\nOther rubbers.\nMedium pips.\nMedium pips rubber is a mainly offensive rubber with pips out like the long and short pips rubber. It is more attack-oriented and has less spin than the long pips rubber, but is not as offensive as the short pips rubber.\nSponge thickness and density.\nThe thickness of the sponge and the density of the sponge layer underneath the rubber also affects the handling of the ball. These affect inverted and antispin rubbers the most, because they rely on sponge for spin and speed more than short and long pips rubber.\nThickness.\nSponge thickness affects the overall rubber speed and control. As a rule of thumb, the thinner the sponge, the more control you have, and the thicker the sponge, the faster it is. Rubbers labeled MX or MAX, short for maximum, have the maximum amount of sponge under the rubber without going over the ITTF regulation of 4.0 mm (0.16 inch). Rubbers labeled OX, short for orthodox, have no sponge beneath the rubber. Usually, inverted and antispin rubber have a larger foam thickness while pip rubber have a smaller thickness.\nDensity.\nSponge density, also called sponge hardness, affects the over rubber spin. As a rule of thumb, a lower density sponge, will have more spin at lower speeds, while a higher sponge density will have more spin at higher speeds. The sponge density affects antispin rubbers the most, for they rely on a soft sponge and a hard rubber surface to reverse spin.\nPicking the right rubber.\nChoosing the right table tennis rubber can be a complex process due to the various factors players must consider, such as playing style, speed, spin, and control. Traditionally, players often seek professional advice by visiting specialized table tennis shops, where experts can guide them through the selection process. These shops offer a hands-on experience and tailored advice, which is invaluable for both novice and experienced players.\nIn recent years, online resources have also emerged to supplement this traditional approach. For example, \"Blade Rubber\" is an online platform that provides personalized rubber recommendations based on user-input questions. The platform considers factors like playing style, skill level, and preferences to suggest rubbers that could be the most suitable for the individual player"

        "text": "Edward 'Eddie' MacDonald is a Canadian retired ice hockey goaltender who was a two-time All-American for Clarkson, and was in net for every game of their undefeated season in 1955–56.\nCareer.\nMacDonald was one of several Canadian players to travel south to play at Clarkson College of Technology for Bill Harrison. After a year with the freshman team, MacDonald joined the varsity squad just in time for the best season in program history. While the offense dominated the competition, scoring nearly seven and a half goals per game, MacDonald backstopped the team to an undefeated record, allowing just 58 goals in the 23 games. The unblemished mark, the first for qualifying NCAA competition, earned Clarkson a bid to the 1956 NCAA Tournament. Unfortunately, because eight players on the team were 4-year varsity players (one more than the NCAA allowed at the time) they would be ineligible to participate. The team unanimously decided that it would decline the invitation and Clarkson's championship hoped would have to wait for another day.\nClarkson's streak ended the following season, losing in the third game of the campaign, but MacDonald refused to allow the team to lose again until the final game of the regular season. The team finished with an 18–2 mark and was again offed a bid to the NCAA tournament and, with all players now eligible, the Golden Knights made their national tournament debut. In the semifinal Clarkson faced off against Colorado College and MacDonald had his hands full against the nation's top offense. The Tigers fired 60 shots at the Clarkson net, about double what is normally seen in a competitive game, compared to the paltry 21 that Clarkson was able to produce. MacDonald was outstanding in the game, turning aside 55 of the shots to give Clarkson a chance, but the Golden Knights came up short, losing 3–5. MacDonald had a slightly easier time in the consolation game against Harvard, facing only 45 shots in an overtime affair, but this time the Golden Knights were able to compliment MacDonald's performance and finish the tournament in third place on Ed Rowe's overtime marker. The 99 saves MacDonald made in the two games earned him First Team All-Tournament honors despite not making the championship game.\nMacDonald was named team captain for his senior season and again produced a stellar season. With the offense lagging, MacDonald was relied on much more heavily than the previous two years and he responded brilliantly, leading the team to a 16–2 record and was named as an AHCA East All-American Clarkson made their second consecutive tournament but in the semifinal their lack of offense caught up to them and they were easily dispatched by Denver. The team finished in third place after another win over Harvard with MacDonald making another All-Tournament team. MacDonald finished his college career with a 48–6 record for a .889 winning percentage, one of the best marks in history and a record for NCAA play. The record would stand for over a decade before being surpassed by Ken Dryden in 1969.\nAfter graduating with a degree in civil engineering, MacDonald continued his playing career and appeared in goal for the Wembley Lions in 1960. He played for the team during the final year of the British National League and when it was over MacDonald's playing career came to a close. He was inducted into the Clarkson Athletic Hall of Fame in 2005."

Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Utah's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "title": "Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on disc golf",
        "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption to disc golf across the world, mirroring its impact across all sports. Throughout the world and to varying degrees, leagues and competitions have been cancelled or postponed.\nSome public disc golf courses saw their baskets pulled out temporarily, as part of national, regional, and municipal containment measures such as quarantines and curfews (variously known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or lockdowns). Nevertheless, as the pandemic progressed, most courses reopened, and some baseball parks set up a makeshift disc golf course to promote the sport, following the cancellation of professional baseball events across the United States.\nDuring the pandemic, there was an increased interest in the sport, partly due to the fact that many disc golf courses remained open – unlike most sports facilities – and partly because disc golf is largely a socially distant sport.\nTimeline.\nMarch 2020.\nOn 6 March, five days before the World Health Organization classified the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic, the Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA) issued its first statement about the COVID-19 outbreak to announce that it was \"evaluating its potential impact on [its] membership across 43 countries on six continents, as well as disc golfers everywhere\" and encouraged tournament directors to follow the directives of local authorities when making decisions related to their events.\nOn 11 March 2020, The College Disc Golf National Championship, a PDGA Major competition set to take place from 1–4 April at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina, was one of the first major disc golf events to be postponed indefinitely.\nOn 13 March, the PDGA announced that PDGA-sanctioned tournaments will still be allowed in areas where they have not been banned.\nOn 18 March 2020 the International Disc Golf Center, serving as the PDGA headquarters, was closed to both staff and visitors until 6 April 2020, together with its three adjacent disc golf courses and pro shop. The next day, the PDGA amended temporarily section 1.03 \"Withdrawals and Refunds\" of the PDGA Competition Manual for Disc Golf Events to guarantee fair cancellations for both organizers and participants.\nOn 19 March 2020, Release Point reached out to Robert Jonas, professor at Texas Lutheran University, and published an article endorsing the continuation of play: The article also answered safety questions and made sanitation recommendations for disc golfers who, in light of the pandemic, found themselves with more free time than usual for playing disc golf.\nThe following day, disc golf think tank Parked tackled the issue of baskets, which were thought to be a transmission vector for the virus, based on a new study published in The New England Journal of Medicine about the virus's decay rate on various surfaces, such as metal baskets and plastic discs.\nOn 23 March 2020, the PDGA asked its members and the entire disc golf community to avoid going to disc golf courses. The next day, the association launched a social media campaign asking its members to \"Skip The Course. Stay Home.\" It also encouraged the disc golf community to share pictures and videos of homemade baskets and practice throws online using the \"#discgolffromhome\" hashtag. Prominent professional disc golfers including Simon Lizotte also participated.\nApril 2020.\nBy 16 April 2020, the PDGA had temporarily furloughed more than half of its staff members and contract support in response to the pandemic. The remaining staff worked remotely and prioritized COVID-19 coordination efforts.\nOn 17 April 2020, the PDGA suspended event sanctioning through 31 May. All PDGA Major and PDGA National Tour events originally scheduled through July 31, 2020 were postponed.\nMay 2020.\nOn 6 May 2020, the PDGA reverted its stance on staying home altogether. Board of Directors president Justin Menickelli posted a \"Letter on Responsible Recreation\" with guidelines for \"returning to the course for casual play,\" since sanctioned events were still postponed until 31 May. In his letter, he stressed the importance of following recommendations from local health authorities, and reminded players to adhere to common sense measures to prevent the spread of the virus. \nOn 14 May, the PDGA announced that it would begin phasing in event sanctioning on a regional basis using a five-step process. As a result, all events scheduled after 14 May 2020 were placed into reserved status with sanctioning pending, and would later be allowed to run \"as soon as local directives permit organized, competitive sporting events to resume\". The same day, Arkansas, Iceland, and Norway were the first regions to resume tournament sanctioning.\nJune 2020.\nSeveral news outlets reported that disc golf was gaining traction as a form of outdoor recreation compatible with social distancing mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCOVID-19 courses and events.\nWith the cancellation of baseball events across the United States, several baseball parks set up a makeshift disc golf course and organized disc golf events during the pandemic. Notable ones include the 9-hole \"Bubba Watson's Diamond Disc Golf Challenge\" at the Admiral Fetterman Field in Pensacola, Florida, the 12-hole course at the Charlotte Knights' Truist Field stadium, and the 9-hole \"Diamond Disc Golf presented by Woodfin\" event at The Diamond stadium in Richmond, Virginia, home of the Richmond Flying Squirrels.\nBy country.\nAustralia.\nThe 2020 Australian Disc Golf Championships were cancelled as a result of COVID-19. On 18 March 2020, Australian Disc Golf suspended all ADG-sanctioned events, including all A, B, C and X tier tournaments and league, until 18 May 2020.\nFinland.\nOn 13 March 2020, the Finnish Disc Golf Association (FDGA, ) announced that all PDGA-sanctioned events in Finland would be cancelled or postponed through 5 April 2020.\nPoland.\nOn 20 March 2020, in light of a national lockdown, the Liga Latających Talerzy postponed its regular meetings and competitions, and considered organizing remote tournaments, whereby players would play individually and trust other players to keep track of their own score. With the loosening of COVID-19 restrictions, events resumed on 24 May 2020. On 21 May 2020, Disc Golf Poland posted a notice deploring the state of the COVID-19 situation and how the government's response impacted disc golf in Poland.\nSweden.\nThe virus was confirmed to have reached Sweden on 31 January 2020, when a woman returning from Wuhan tested positive. The first death was reported on 11 March in Stockholm. Unlike many other countries, Sweden did not impose a generalized lockdown. Nevertheless, the Public Health Agency of Sweden (), the government agency responsible for managing the pandemic, issued several bans, as the crisis evolved.\nOn 27 March 2020, the Swedish government announced a ban on public gatherings and public events (such as sports competitions) with more than 50 participants. On 29 May 2020, the Swedish Disc Golf Association () made official recommendations based on directives by the Swedish Sports Confederation (, RF) and the Swedish Police Authority ().\nSwitzerland.\nOn 16 April 2020, the Federal Council announced that businesses referred to in article 6, al. 3, of Order 2 COVID-19 would be authorized to reopen starting 27 April 2020, provided that they draft a COVID-19 protection plan (in , ). On 26 April 2020, the Swiss Disc Golf Association published the German-language version of its COVID-19 protection plan, and a French-language translation by Disc Golf Genève President Yannick Fernandez and Vice-president Emile Barbe followed suit a week later.\nOn 29 May 2020, the Swiss Federal Office of Sport, the Federal Office of Public Health, and the Swiss Olympic Association published updated graphics in German and French with new directives for resuming competitions in Switzerland, effective 6 June 2020. Per the new directives, sporting events were capped to 300 people, attendance lists were required for facilitating contact tracing, players were required to keep of social distancing when possible, and sick players were banned from training and competitions.\nUnited States.\nThe Junior Disc Golf Association (J.D.G.A) amended its rulebook by adding Section 7.1, which includes rules pertaining to COVID-19 safety. Per the new rules, all matches and events will take place outdoors, high fives and disc sharing are forbidden, and cards will be limited to 5 people, with officials ideally aiming for 3 people. Players with a fever above are forbidden from play, and parents must report to a J.D.G.A official if a player is diagnosed with COVID-19.\nEvents.\nOn 13 March, the 2020 Dynamic Discs Glass Blown Open (GBO) was officially cancelled. The organizers later announced that the event would unfold from 28 April to 2 May per the initial schedule, but as a virtual event instead.\nOn 20 May 2020, a week after four out of six PDGA National Tour events were postponed or cancelled, the PDGA announced that the last two events of tour will be cancelled (the 2020 Delaware Disc Golf Challenge and the 2020 Music City Open). The Tour itself was delayed until 2021 amid uncertainty regarding sanctioning and minimal staff. Four of the PDGA Euro Tour's tournaments were cancelled, and one was postponed. The Disc Golf Pro Tour resumed after a hiatus on 13 March.\nThe United States Disc Golf Championship (USDGC) unfolded on 7–10 October 2020 as scheduled originally, but no spectators were allowed on site, and smaller events were suspended: Opening and Closing ceremonies, Big Arm Big Heart Distance Showcase, EDGE (Education Disc Golf Experience) Learning Village, Competitor and Fan Hospitality Areas, and Tournament Pro Shop On-Site. The 2020 Throw Pink Women's Event was rescheduled for 11 October, and it included precautionary measures including COVID-19 screening at the entrance, limiting the size of clinic groups to 4 people, and requiring facemasks except when actively throwing."

The A6 road runs across the course and golfers have to make their way across to reach the 8th to 10th holes. \nBuxton and High Peak Golf Club was founded in 1887. The nine-hole course on Barms Common (now known as Fairfield Common) was designed by John Morris from Hoylake. Local architect William Radford Bryden won the inaugural championship. The course was extended to 18 holes in 1893. The club rented the land from the Borough Council, which had agreed to buy the grazing rights on Fairfield Common from the local farmers. Jack Simpson (winner of the 1884 Open Championship) was recruited as the club's first golf professional. The clubhouse, funded by debentures, was built in 1905 on Waterswallows Road. Edward Cavendish, the Marquess of Hartington (heir to the Dukedom of Devonshire), presented a competition trophy to the club and the Hartington Cup has been played for since 1920.\nThe 9th par 5 hole is called Standside, which refers to where the grandstand of Buxton Racecourse once stood. The horse racing track was laid out on the common in the early 1800s. From 1821 race meetings were held each year in June. The Duke of Devonshire commissioned a grandstand building which stood in the 1830s. Buxton racecourse closed in 1840 and the grandstand was pulled down.\nIn 1899 the Ladies Golf Club's nine hole course was set out on Temple Meads (which was developed as a housing estate in the 1960s). Cavendish Golf Club is the other remaining golf course in Buxton and it was opened in 1925."

Therefore the Spanish team should be the substitute. But they rejected because they have no time to build a good team again. On 28 January 1970 the former rival USA was taken as replacement."

The three built a tremendous working partnership during their year with the freshman team and when they debuted for the varsity squad in 1954 the trio provided the bulk of the Saints' offense. The sophomores were the top three scorers for the saints with O'Brien leading the team with 58 points. As of 2020 all three totals were in the top five for rookie performances in St. Lawrence history. The 69 combined goals from the 'Ottawa Connection' were more than half the total offense from the saints that season and was enough to get the Larries back into the NCAA tournament. In the semifinal against Colorado College the young players were held back by a veteran defensive corps and St. Lawrence fell 2–1. In the consolation game the following night the Saints lost again, finishing in 4th place, but the line was again held scoreless. It was no surprise that SLU finished last in the tournament when their top offensive contributors came up empty.\nThe three were again the font of the team's offense in their junior seasons, this time with McLean leading the Larries in scoring. The Saints finished in second place in their conference but, because Clarkson declined their tournament bid, St. Lawrence went in their place. St. Lawrence faced defending champion Michigan in the semifinal and the two fought a defensive battle through most of the game. SLU scored first at the end of the second period but Michigan tied the score shortly after the third began. The game went into overtime but the Wolverines weren't waiting around and scored just over 80 seconds into the extra session to again send the Larries to the consolation game. St. Lawrence was pitted against Boston College and this time the Saints offense made an appearance. After building a 1-goal lead in the first, BC's guns fell silent thanks to Sarge Whittier, who was playing only because regular starter Bill Sloan was ineligible for the tournament, and St. Lawrence scored three goals in rapid succession to put the team ahead for good. McLean began the outburst by tying the score with the first point from any of the three linemates and went on to be named to the All-Tournament Second Team.\nMcLean was named team captain for the following season and he responded by again leading the Saints in scoring. SLU, however, had a down year and finished 3rd in the Tri-State League. Despite the less-than-stellar season for the team, McLean was named as an AHCA Second Team All-American and finished his career as the program's 3rd-leading scorer, just behind O'Brian and just ahead of Fornier.\nIn 1993, with all three players inextricably linked, St. Lawrence inducted all three as the 'Ottawa Connection' into their Athletic Hall of Fame."

        "text": "Russell \"Buzz\" LaVonne Johnson (November 9, 1921 – February 14, 2006) was an American ice hockey Center who played for North Dakota after World War II.\nCareer.\nWhen North Dakota was preparing to bring back its ice hockey program after World War II, brothers Buzz and Prince Johnson were playing amateur hockey for the Grand Forks Amerks and came to the attention of Cal Marvin, who was leading the effort to rekindle the team. Both players began attending the University of North Dakota and made their debuts in the 1947–48 season. The team played well with Johnson on the team, posting their first double-digit win season. The team flagged the following year because Johnson had played well enough to be included on the US national team for the 1949 Ice Hockey World Championships. While missing the entire season for North Dakota, Johnson was nearly a point-per-game player over eight games as the US won the bronze medal. He did, however, have an even greater impact after the championship was over; Zdeněk Marek, a member of the gold-medal-winning Czech team, had decided to hide in Stockholm rather than return to Czechoslovakia because he was not a member of the Communist Party. During his time playing for the team he had confided his trepidation at returning home to Johnson and his brother. The two promised to assist Marek in earning a student visa so he could defect to the United States. The plan came to fruition when North Dakota offered Marek a scholarship on July 12, 1949. Marek was eventually granted permanent resident status by an act of congress and lived in the United States until his death in 2019.\nFor his senior season, Johnson helped North Dakota to a 15-6-2 record, finishing just behind Colorado College for the second western seed in the NCAA tournament. Johnson's 50-point campaign set a new program record that he shared with his brother and he became one of the first two players in North Dakota history to be named as an AHCA All-American. \nAfter the college season had finished, Johnson was again a member of Team USA at the 1950 Ice Hockey World Championships and finished second on the team in scoring to help the US to a Silver medal. He was unable to repeat his diplomatic coup as the entire Czech team had been prevented from leaving the country when the government discovered that several players were planning a similar tactic as Marek.\nJohnson was inducted into the North Dakota hall of fame in 1981."

        "title": "Marco Rossi (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Marco Rossi (born 23 September 2001) is an Austrian professional ice hockey player for the Minnesota Wild of the National Hockey League (NHL).\nRossi grew up in Austria and moved to Switzerland in 2011 to further his career. He spent several years there, making his professional debut in 2018 with the GCK Lions of the Swiss League, the second tier of hockey in Switzerland. In 2018 he moved to North America and spent two seasons with the Ottawa 67's of the junior Ontario Hockey League (OHL). He led the OHL in scoring and was named the most valuable player of the league in 2019–20. Regarded as a top prospect for the 2020 NHL Entry Draft, Rossi was selected ninth overall by the Wild, and made his NHL debut in 2022. Internationally Rossi has played for the Austrian national junior team at the under-18 World Championships and World Junior Championships.\nPlaying career.\nRossi first played hockey in his native Austria when he was 3 years old. At the age of 10 Rossi moved to Switzerland to further his career, and Feldkirch, his hometown, is close to the Austria–Switzerland border. At the age of 13 Rossi moved to Zürich again to help his career, with him and his father commuting two hours each way in order to allow Marco to stay at home and continue his education. He played in the junior system of Switzerland within the system of the ZSC Lions, frequently playing in older age categories. He made his professional debut in the 2017–18 season, playing 18 games and recording 7 points for the GCK Lions of the Swiss League, the second-highest league in Switzerland. After the season he was selected 18th overall by the Ottawa 67's of the Ontario Hockey League in the Canadian Hockey League Import Draft. He played 53 games with Ottawa in 2018–19 and scored 65 points, finishing fourth on the team in scoring, and had an additional 22 points in 17 playoff games. Rossi was named to the OHL Second All-Star Team as a result. Rossi returned to Ottawa for the 2019–20 season and led the OHL, and the entire CHL in scoring with 120 points in 56 games. He was awarded the Eddie Powers Memorial Trophy and CHL Top Scorer Award for leading the OHL and CHL in scoring, respectively, and was named the most outstanding player in the OHL, winning the Red Tilson Trophy, and was also named to the OHL's First All-Star Team. He was the first European player to lead the OHL in scoring (Stan Mikita, who was born in Slovakia and raised in Canada, did so in the 1958–59 season).\nHeading into the 2020 NHL Entry Draft Rossi was regarded as a top prospect, and the NHL Central Scouting Bureau had him ranked as the sixth-best North American-based skater for the draft. He was selected in the first-round, ninth overall, by the Minnesota Wild. On 23 October 2020, Rossi was signed by the Wild to a three-year, entry-level contract. Five days later, he was loaned to the ZSC Lions until the start of NHL training camp. He held a Swiss player-license after having played most of his junior hockey in Switzerland, but only played one game for ZSC. The NHL delayed the start of the 2020–21 season until January 2021, and Rossi was invited to join the Wild's training camp prior to the season starting. However, he returned to Austria due to long-term complications from COVID-19; he had tested positive late in 2020 for the virus. Speaking about his battle with the virus, Rossi stated: \"I’m thankful to God that he supported me. ... I’m just happy that I’m still alive.\"\nRossi started the 2021–22 season with Minnesota's minor league affiliate, the Iowa Wild of the American Hockey League. After playing 21 games in the AHL, where he scored 23 points, Rossi was recalled to Minnesota in January 2022, and made his NHL debut on 6 January 2022 against the Boston Bruins. He played two games in the NHL before returning to Iowa.\nInternational play.\nThe first International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) tournament Rossi played at was the 2017 World U18 Championship Division IB, the third tier of the tournament. He scored 8 points in 5 games, leading the Austrian national team in scoring and playing third overall. Rossi subsequently played at the 2018 World Junior Championship IA, the second tier at that level. With 5 points in 5 games he led the Austrian national junior team and finished tied for fifth overall. He returned to the under-18 level for the 2018 Division IB tournament, recording 7 points in 5 games to place second for Austria and tied for fourth overall.\nRossi served as Austria's captain during the 2021 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. He went scoreless in four games, as Austria only scored one goal, losing all four games.\nPersonal life.\nRossi is the youngest of three children of Michael and Claudia Rossi; he has two sisters, Estelle and Marielle. His father, Michael, played hockey for 20 years, mainly with VEU Feldkirch. He is in a relationship with Stefanie Prast, who was introduced to him by Estelle. Rossi does not drink alcohol and is a devout Christian: he and Prast pray together before every game.\nRossi is a fan of Red Bull Racing in Formula One."

        "text": "The 1926–27 Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey season was the 29th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nBefore the season began, Harvard made a decision to end their annual contests against Princeton. The two teams had played one another, often multiple times, every year since 1901 with exception of the 1918 campaign (due to World War I). The problem was that Princeton hadn't challenged for a league championship since before the War, which was also the last time they had beaten Harvard in the season series. Harvard was also able to fill the gap in their schedule with the return of Brown after a 20-year hiatus.\nA bigger issue that Harvard had to contend with was a new rule limiting each team to just 12 players per game. While that didn't affect most programs, the Crimson had been routinely using many alternates during their games, resulting in 15 or more players in some contests. Regardless of the new limitations, Harvard began the season well. After a solid win over MIT the team played three games against Canadian colleges and finished with a split decision, a difficult task considering the quality of their opponents. Unfortunately, the team also lost sophomore forward Henry Crosby to appendicitis just before the second Toronto game.\nAfter proving their international mettle, Harvard played its first ever western opponent when it hosted Notre Dame. The Crimson dominated the Irish 7–0 but little beyond that could be established from the game as Notre Dame wasn't a particularly strong team that season. Harvard avenged a loss from the year before with a hard-fought victory over Boston University then entered their showdown against Yale with a chance at another intercollegiate title. The Crimson offense overpowered the Elis in the first game, and after securing a season-series win over Dartmouth with a tie, Harvard finished the season at the newly-refurbished New Haven Arena. Harvard built a 2-goal lead and then played their typical stifling defense to earn a 2–1 win and finish the season undefeated against collegiate opponents.\nA day after the victory, head coach Edward Bigelow announced that he was resigning from his position to devote himself fully to his business career. Though his tenure was short, few could claim as much success as Bigelow did with two intercollegiate championships and a record of 25–8–2 (22–3–1 against collegiate opponents).\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

He has previously played in MLB for the Tampa Bay Rays.\nAmateur career.\nFleming attended Columbia High School in Columbia, Illinois, where he pitched for the Eagles. He enrolled at Webster University, where he played college baseball.\nProfessional career.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nThe Tampa Bay Rays selected Fleming in the fifth round of the 2017 MLB draft. He signed and made his debut with the Princeton Rays, that year. Fleming's 2017 stat line included a 5.40 earned run average (ERA) across 12 games (nine starts). In 2018, Fleming began the season with the Bowling Green Hot Rods, where he posted a 1.20 ERA over ten games. Fleming began pitching for the Charlotte Stone Crabs in July, achieving a record of 3–3 with a 4.11 ERA. In posting a 2019 season record that included a 3.31 ERA over 21 games, Fleming was named the MVP of the season by the Montgomery Biscuits . He finished the season with the Durham Bulls, compiling a 5.14 ERA across four games.\nIn July 2020, the Rays added Fleming to their 60-man roster. On August 21, after Rays starter Yonny Chirinos was ruled out for the rest of the 2020 season with a torn UCL, Kevin Cash announced Fleming would be called up to make his debut on August 23, against the Toronto Blue Jays. His contract was officially selected to the active roster on August 23. Fleming earned the win in his big league debut, pitching five innings with three strikeouts and two earned runs in a 5–4 Rays victory. He finished the season with a 5–0 record and a 2.78 ERA in innings.\nOn July 7, 2021, Fleming combined with Collin McHugh, Diego Castillo, Matt Wisler, and Peter Fairbanks to no–hit the Cleveland Indians. However, since the feat was achieved in a truncated seven–inning doubleheader game, it was not recorded as an official no-hitter. Fleming made 26 appearances for the Rays in 2021, which included 11 starts. In innings pitched, he logged a 10–8 record and 5.09 ERA with 65 strikeouts and 1 save. In 2022, Fleming made only 10 appearances (3 starts) for the Rays, missing time with an oblique injury. In 35.0 innings of work, he struggled to a 2–5 record and 6.43 ERA with 29 strikeouts.\nIn 2023, Fleming began the year with the Rays, pitching in 11 games before he was scratched from a scheduled start against the Boston Red Sox and placed on the injured list with elbow soreness on June 2. An MRI revealed cartilage buildup on his elbow bone as well as inflammation, and he was transferred to the 60–day injured list on June 10. He was activated on August 12. Following the season on November 4, Fleming was removed from the 40–man roster and sent outright to Triple–A Durham.\nOn November 6, 2023, Fleming was claimed off waivers by the Philadelphia Phillies. However, he was not tendered a contract for 2024 and became a free agent on November 17.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nOn February 14, 2024, Fleming signed a one-year contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates.\nPersonal life.\nFleming and his wife, Katie, met at Webster University (where she played volleyball) and were married in St. Louis in November 2020."

        "text": "Laurie Nichols (1 January 1919 – 2 February 2000) was an Australian supporter of the Balmain Tigers, well regarded as the \"greatest\" fan in Balmain Tigers history, most well known for his \"shadowboxing\", at the Tigers' home ground Leichhardt Oval.\nEarly life.\nLaurie was born on 1 January 1919 into a family of 12 other siblings of which he was close to the middle. His father was a wood carter and Laurie would accompany him and deliver wood to the other homes in the area. At an early age he developed both an interest in sport and primary produce, and aged 10 he was first introduced to boxing at the local Police Boys Club. Aged in his early teens he started working in the General Store, still in Cooma, working off and on tanning and selling rabbit skins.\nThe Number One Fan.\nIn 1969 after the Balmain Tigers 11th Premiership, at age 50, the Balmain Leagues Club presented Laurie Nichols with a Balmain Jersey, inscribed on the back with \"Number One Fan\". This was the first recognition officially granted to the man who was not just a fan, as the title suggests, but was a true fanatic in the essential meaning of the word. Throughout the 1970s and 80s despite the hard times the Tigers were facing, Nichols still \"religiously followed\" the club. Benny Elias, the hooker for the Balmain Tigers said: \"He'd be on the bus going to the games with the players and was at training as much as the players were. He was from Springwood and it's a long trip and he'd make the journey just to see us train. You don't get more fanatical than that.\" He lived and breathed for Balmain and attended every game for 30 years at Leichhardt Oval before the club merged with Western Suburbs Magpies.\nFox Sports.\nIn 2017, Fox Sports Commentator Andrew Voss, has declared Laurie Nichols to be the NRL's best fan.\nLaurie's Lane.\nOn 28 June 2015, the laneway at Leichhardt Oval was named \"Laurie's Lane\", and the residents of Lilyfield painted a mural in dedication of him, at the lane.\nBalmain Tigers merger.\nIn 1999, during the Super League War, the ARL and Super League agreed to merge with 14 teams, in their new competition, the NRL. During the war, the 17 teams of the ARL and Super League, had to fight for survival. The Balmain Tigers although always loyal to the ARL, the new financial requirements of the competition meant Balmain couldn't afford to go it alone. In 1999 talks of Balmain merging, first with the Parramatta Eels, and then with the Western Suburbs Magpies. At several public meetings, Laurie cried openly, tears flooding as he spoke passionately against any merge.\nHowever, after much anxiety and a vote, it was decided that Balmain would merge with Wests, becoming the new \"Wests Tigers\" for the 2000 competition.\nIt is agreed that Laurie spoke to the team at their final training session before their first game the following week. Wayne Pearce, who was coach at the time, says that Laurie voiced his acceptance of the team, that he told the boys to keep the heart of the Tigers and that he wished them all the best. Benny Elias and close friend Johnny Lewis say that Laurie would never have said such a thing, and that he was always heartbroken about what happened to the team and to the club.\nMedia appearances.\nThroughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Laurie starred in multiple TV Shows, including Pizza, where he played a shadowboxing and gymnasium-using hero, and the Footy Show, where he made a guest appearance, during a birthday special for Steve Roach.\nDeath.\nIn February 2000, Laurie Nichols died due to an ulcer rupturing in his stomach at the age of 81, he died just two weeks before the Wests Tigers made their debut match. At his funeral, over 1000 people attended, including Balmain Tigers Coach Wayne Pearce, and former Balmain Tigers Captain Ben Elias."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. As of the next college basketball season in 2024–25, the Huskies represent the University of Washington in the NCAA Division I Big Ten Conference.\nWashington began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1895. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Washington's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

It is consistently voted as one of the top 100 golf courses in England.\nIn 1923, Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire, commissioned Dr Alister MacKenzie to create and build an 18-hole golf course on moorland owned by the Devonshire estate in Buxton. The course was open to men and women from its opening in 1925. The Cavendish was one of MacKenzie's last UK course designs. He went on to design courses in Australasia, South America and the USA, including the world-famous Augusta National golf course, which opened in 1932 and hosts The Masters annual major golf championship. The Cavendish course was bought by the members from the 11th Duke of Devonshire in 1955. Although the course is under 6,000 yards long, the design of the sloping greens is acknowledged as its main challenge. The course record of 61 is 7 under par.\nIn the 1990s, many native deciduous trees were planted around the course, funded by grants from the Forestry Commission.\nBuxton and High Peak Golf Club was the first golf course in Buxton, founded in 1886 on Fairfield Common. In 1899, the Ladies Golf Club's nine hole course was set out on Temple Meads (which was developed as a housing estate in the 1960s). After the First World War, Canadian troops based in Buxton created a toboggan run across what would later be the first three fairways of the Cavendish course. The toboggan run is still marked on the OS Explorer Map OL24. The Peak District Boundary Walk runs across the golf course."

        "title": "Abingdon Rowing Club",
        "text": "Abingdon Rowing Club is a rowing club on the River Thames based on Wilsham Road in Abingdon-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.\nThe club's home water is the stretch of the upper Thames between the Abingdon and the Culham locks. The total rowable length of this water stretch is approximately 4 km (3900m).\nThe official club colours are teal-green and gold in accordance with the Abingdon coat of arms. The club badge logo features region peculiar Sika deer winged and above the Abingdon bridge arch holding the two lightnings representing Culham and Harwell science campuses, honouring the academics and professionals who largely constituted and contributed to Abingdon Rowing Club.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded in 1958 and has produced multiple British champions since.\nEarly days.\nA rowing club had existed in Abingdon in the middle of the 19th century with limited success until the club was disbanded in 1878. The old club organised a yearly rowing race on the Abingdon stretch of the Thames with a sculler trophy originating from 1868 that is still in use by Abingdon R.C.\nThe current club was re-established on 26 June 1958 in the Bear Room of the Abingdon Guildhall with the formation of a small club committee consisting of Alderman C. G. Barber and Fitzgerald O'Connor as chairman. Rowing activity commenced immediately through generous help from Abingdon Boys School Boat Club, which donated the first shell and a set of blades bought from Oxford City. The first competition appearance of the new Abingdon R.C. was on 2 August 1958 at St Neots regatta, where Abingdon won its first race against Crowland rowing club but lost in the final against Nottingham University.\nDevelopment years and boathouse.\nAfter initial success at British rowing competitions in 1958 and 1959, the club was stagnating in the 1959/1960 season because of the lack of a proper boathouse. In late 1959 the first modest Abingdon R.C. boathouse, named 'The Nissen Hut', was erected at the corner of the Abbey Meadows island. 1961 also saw the inauguration of the renewed Abingdon Head of the River Race, which became a popular annual event. By 1964 the club had achieved steady growth, winning three consecutive Oxford City Bumps (1961, 1962, 1963). At the beginning of 1964, Abingdon town and Vale of White Horse region decided to further develop Abbey Meadows with a public swimming pool, hotel and new residential block, meaning the rowing club had to relocate. The new location for the clubhouse was at Wilsham Road, next to the Army ground and sailing club. A new boathouse was built with the help of government funding in mid-1965. The club has been based in the Wilsham Road clubhouse ever since. The clubhouse has seen many additions and improvements, lastly at the beginning of the current century through the National Lottery funding. The current clubhouse consists of three hangar bays (doubles/pairs bay, singles bay and large boats 8s and 4s bay), modern men's and women's changing rooms with showers and bathrooms, a kitchen with dining and TV room, and a gym with weight room and rowing machines section.\nSince the mid-1960s to early 1990s, the club has had steady success, winning in multiple boat classes across junior and senior categories for men and women at national regattas and the British Rowing Championships.\nCurrent times.\nSince beginning of the current century and popularity of Masters rowing (known as Veterans in Great Britain until 2010) the Masters age groups within the club grew to become the second largest age category after the Juniors. Abingdon R.C. has also continued with an average success in its primary senior rowing although with only occasional appearances on Head of The River Race and Henley Royal Regatta. The club has had more success in recent time at British Rowing Championships (Junior and Masters), Henley Masters regatta and lately at FISA World Rowing Masters Championships.\nAbingdon Head of the River.\nAbingdon Spring Head of the River is a rowing time-trial race event held annually in mid-April on the river Thames in Abingdon. The competition was founded in 1961 by the Abingdon Rowing Club and traditionally it is the last head race event of the season in British Rowing competition calendar before BR regatta season commences. The inaugural Abingdon Head of the River Race was organised under Ron Stovold's secretaryship. The event immediately gained in popularity. Initially designed for fours racing shells, the event quickly became the second-largest time trial event for the fours in the UK. Subsequently, multiple boat classes and categories have been added to the event. Nowadays Abingdon Spring Head covers all boat classes across the whole range of age categories from Juniors aged 13 to Masters-I aged 85. As the event is held in mid-April with longer daylight and summer daylight-saving time, it accommodates four divisions and allows a full day of rowing racing for 360 crews. Historical trophies are presented to the winners of selected traditional challenges of the Abingdon Spring Head:\nThe course.\nAbingdon Head is raced on a 2 km upstream course on the River Thames stretch from Culham reach to the St. Helen's church in Abingdon. The start line is approximately 150m below the Culham cut bifurcation and \"Danger\" sign. From the start the race heads north towards the Abingdon town centre with west river bank on the Sutton Courtenay side and the east on the Culham side. After first 1000m, the course goes into an S-band near Abingdon Marina, with the final 750m through Abingdon town between the Abingdon school boathouse and St. Helen's church.\nAbingdon R.C.

        "text": "Antonio \"Booman\" Williams (born January 12, 1997) is an American professional basketball player for KR of the Úrvalsdeild karla. Prior to his professional career, he played college basketball for Indian Hills Community College and Kent State.\nEarly life and high school career.\nWilliams grew up in K-Town, Chicago. At the age of 6 or 7, he began playing football, followed by soccer and basketball shortly afterward. In middle school, Williams scored 30 points in his first AAU game. By the time he enrolled in his freshman year at Farragut Career Academy, Williams decided to focus on basketball instead of football. He transferred to Proviso East High School before his sophomore season, playing under Donnie Boyce. Williams missed 20 games during his junior season due to academic ineligibility. As a senior, he averaged 24 points and six rebounds per game, earning Third Team All-State honors. Partially due to his academic issues, Williams received no Division I scholarship offers, so he decided to attend Indian Hills Community College.\nCollege career.\nAs a freshman, Williams averaged 9.3 points and 1.7 steals per game on a team that finished 29-5. During his sophomore season, Williams averaged 14.7 points and 4.8 rebounds per game and earned All-Region first team honors. He helped lead Indian Hills to a 33-1 record. Williams committed to Kent State due to its relatively close distance to his home in Chicago. \nAs a junior, he averaged 11.5 points and 4.0 rebounds per game. On February 21, 2020, Williams posted a career-high 34 points in a 104-98 double overtime loss to Buffalo. He followed up that performance by scoring a game-high 17 points to lead Kent State past Miami (Ohio) 74-61. As a senior, Williams averaged 14.7 points, 3.8 assists, and 3.9 rebounds per game. He was named to the Second Team All-MAC as well as the MAC Defensive Team.\nProfessional career.\nOn August 8, 2020, Williams signed with Vevey Riviera of the Swiss Basketball League. He never played for them because the club had big financial and administrative problems. In 2021 he signed with BC Tallinna Kalev in Estonia. In July 2021, Williams joined the Ottawa Blackjacks of the Canadian Elite Basketball League. On December 16, 2021, he signed with the Plymouth City Patriots of the British Basketball League.\nOn January 6, 2023, Williams signed with KR of the Úrvalsdeild karla.\nPersonal life.\nWilliams is the son of Tamara Willis. His father was shot after entering a convenience store when Williams was 15. He received his nickname, Booman, from his aunt. Williams has a son, Ayden, born in 2015, with former girlfriend Sariah Vance."

Calgary was selected as a replacement of China to host the halfpipe, big air and slopestyle events, but on 20 January 2021, they pulled out.\nRussia doping ban.\nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for a period of four years, after the Russian government was found to have tampered with laboratory data that it provided to WADA in January 2019 as a condition of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency being reinstated. As a result of the ban, WADA plans to allow individually cleared Russian athletes to take part in the 2021-2022 World Championships and 2022 Summer Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but they will not be permitted to compete in team sports. The title of the neutral banner has yet to be determined; WADA Compliance Review Committee head Jonathan Taylor stated that the IOC would not be able to use \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR) as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes cannot be portrayed as representing a specific country. Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the WADA decision. After reviewing the case on appeal, CAS ruled on 17 December 2020 to reduce the penalty that WADA had placed on Russia. Instead of banning Russia from sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but for a period of two years, the team cannot use the Russian name, flag, or anthem and must present themselves as \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\". The ruling does allow for team uniforms to display \"Russia\" on the uniform as well as the use of the Russian flag colors within the uniform's design, although the name should be up to equal predominance as the \"Neutral Athlete/Team\" designation.\nSchedule.\n28 events were held."

Wilson tied the match at 2–2 with a break of 114. The match was later tied again at both 3–3 and 4–4. After a break of 80 in the ninth frame by Wilson, Gilbert again tied the match again at 5–5. Gilbert won the match after Wilson missed a pot on the pink. Davis described Gilbert as a \"vastly improved player\" and said Wilson would rue the missed pink in the deciding frame. Murphy and Bingham, who had contested the 2015 World Snooker Championship final, met in the second quarter-final. Murphy won the first two frames before Bingham won a frame with a break of 133 and a second recovering from 0–58 points behind. Murphy missed pots in the next two frames allowing Bingham to win the frames, but won the seventh frame with a break of 70. Bingham won the next two frames to win the match 6–3 after a lengthy 47-minute ninth frame.\nYan Bingtao playing in his first Masters event drew Stephen Maguire. Yan took the match's first two frames but lost the next three frames including a break of 102. Two missed by Maguire allowed Yan to win the next two frames and lead 4–3. Maguire evened the score in the next frame with a break of 137, but missed a in the ninth frame to fall behind again. In the tenth frame, attempting a , Maguire fluked a separate red ball into the middle pocket and won the frame to force a decider. Yan took the final frame to win 6–5 with the highest break of his career, a 141.\nThe last quarter-final was between Higgins and O'Sullivan. This was the 70th competitive match between the two since they turned professional in 1992. O'Sullivan won the opening frame with a break of 97, but Higgins responded with a 110 and 145—the highest of the tournament—to lead 3–1. O'Sullivan made two more century breaks of 125 and 103 in frames five and six to even the score at 3–3. A bad by O'Sullivan allowed Higgins to make a 134 in the next frame, the fifth consecutive century break of the match. Higgins won frame eight with a break of 88 and won the match in frame nine 6–3. The five consecutive century breaks equalled the record for the Masters by Robertson and Maguire in 2009. Former world champion John Parrott described Higgins' performance as \"spellbinding\", whilst six-time winner Stephen Hendry was surprised he did not play to this quality more often. Higgins suggested after the match that he \"can't play any better\" than he had, as O'Sullivan backed Higgins to win the tournament after this performance.\nSemi-finals.\nBoth semi-final matches were played on 16 January. Bingham won the opening frame of the match by only seven points before Yan made a break of 94 to equal the match at 1–1. Yan had the first chance in the next two frames, but Bingham won both. Yan won two of the next three frames and trailed 3–4 but won frame eight with a score of 106–0. He took the lead in the ninth frame with a century break. Bingham tied the match after Yan had missed a red. Yan won the match 6–5 after a break of 65 in the deciding frame. Doherty commented that Yan's \"composure was fantastic in that last frame\", whilst O'Sullivan suggested it was a \"significant result for Chinese snooker\".\nThe second semi-final was contested between Gilbert and Higgins. Both players cited their previous meeting in the semi-finals of the 2019 World Snooker Championship, where Higgins won 17–16. Gilbert won the opening frame with a break of 80 before Higgins made a 106 in frame two. The scores were tied at 2–2, with Higgins making a clearance to win frame four. Frame five featured a break of 107 by Higgins, who took a two-frame lead with a break of 55 in frame six. Gilbert tied the match at 4–4 after Higgins missed the final pink to win frame eight. Higgins won the next two frames, however, to win the match 6–4. Higgins commented after the match: \"I personally think semi-finals are the worst game, you are close to being in a showpiece and David did not play great.\"\nFinal.\nThe final was played on 17 January as the best-of-19 frames held over two sessions, refereed by Paul Collier. Higgins had not appeared in the final of the event since he last won the Masters in 2006, whilst Yan was appearing in his first Triple Crown final. Yan took the opening frame of the final, with a break of 66; Higgins won the next. Frame three featured a missed pot on the by Higgins, who won the fourth to tie the match at 2–2. Higgins took the next two frames, including a break of 98, before Yan made a break of 97 in frame seven. Higgins won frame eight, the final of the first session, to lead 5–3 with a break of 52. Steve Davis referred to Yan as \"naive\", saying he needed a \"flying start and get his tail up\" to win the match in the second session.\nHiggins opened frame nine with a break of 67, but Yan's clearance forced a re-spotted black. After a prolonged battle, Yan cut the black to trail 4–5. Yan made a break of 76 to tie the match at 5–5. Frame 11 featured a break of 51 by Yan, before Higgins made a 74 after making a plant, then a 116 in the next frame to lead again by two frames. With just the final ball remaining in frame 13, Higgins attempted a double but missed allowing Yan to win the frame. Yan made a break of 103 in the next frame to tie the score at 7–7. When Yan won frame 15, Higgins left the arena muttering to himself. Higgins returned and made a break of 63 to tie the score at 8–8. A break of 70 won Yan frame 17. He won the match in frame 18 with a break of 64.\nAged 20 years and 11 months, Yan was the youngest Masters winner since O'Sullivan in 1995, 26 years earlier, and the first debutant winner since Selby in 2008. The odds were 50–1 against Yan becoming champion at the outset of the event. Higgins suggested Yan would become the world champion \"without a shadow of a doubt\", and winning the event at his age was a \"brilliant achievement\". Yan commented: \"I have imagined how I would celebrate but I am very calm, even though in the last few frames I was not playing very well. But I did not give up.\" O'Sullivan said he would be \"very surprised if he doesn't win at least one or two world titles\", whilst Davis commented he was \"impressed with his temperament and his nerve\" in defeating Higgins.\nTournament draw.\nNumbers given on the left and in brackets show the players' seeding for the tournament.

        "text": "James E. Morgan (June 13, 1934 – September 29, 2019) was an American basketball player and race horse trainer. He played college basketball for the Louisville Cardinals and won a National Invitation Tournament (NIT) championship in 1956. Morgan was selected by the Syracuse Nationals in the 1957 NBA draft but never played in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was a high school teacher and basketball coach in Ohio until he became a horse trainer in the mid-1960s. Morgan was one of Ohio's leading horse trainers over a 40-year career.\nEarly life.\nMorgan was born on June 13, 1934, in Hyden, Kentucky, as one of seven children to parents William and Mae Morgan. He spent his early life living with his family in a two-room log cabin that had no electricity or running water until it was burnt down when sparks jumped from a wood fire. During the early 1940s, Morgan and his family moved to Dayton, Ohio, where his father worked at a Delco Electronics factory.\nBasketball career.\nMorgan attended Stivers High School in Dayton and led the team to a No. 1 state ranking in the early 1950s. Morgan opted to play for the Louisville Cardinals over offers from the Kentucky Wildcats and his hometown Dayton Flyers. He scored 1,105 points in four seasons played with the Cardinals. The Cardinals won the 1956 National Invitation Tournament when they defeated the Dayton Flyers.\nMorgan was selected by the Syracuse Nationals as the 15th overall pick in the 1957 NBA draft but opted to not sign with the team after they offered him a $5,000 contract. He was a social studies teacher and basketball coach at Stebbins High School in Riverside, Ohio, for nine seasons.\nRace horse training career.\nMorgan resigned from Stebbins in 1966 so he could pursue a longtime dream and became a race horse trainer which he had first become interested in when he worked as an usher at the Churchill Downs racetrack in 1953. Morgan was one of the most successful Thoroughbred trainers in the Midwest and won over 300 stakes races to make him the winningest stakes trainer in Ohio. His horses amassed 1,993 total wins and made earnings of $20.7 million from 1967 to 2008. Morgan served as president of the Ohio Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association, and a trustee in the Thoroughbred's Horsemen's Health Fund from 1998 until his death. \nHonors.\nMorgan was inducted into the Louisville Cardinals Athletics Hall of Fame in 1981, the Stivers Athletic Hall of Fame in 2006, and the Ohio Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013. He had his No. 12 jersey honored by the Louisville Cardinals and it hangs in the rafters of Freedom Hall.\nPersonal life.\nMorgan had two children. Two of his brothers were collegiate athletes at Morehead State University: Mickey on the basketball team and Tom on the football team.\nMorgan survived a serious heart attack in 1993 and continued working despite being recommended to retire by a doctor.\nMorgan died at the age of 85 from a suspected heart attack in Dayton on September 29, 2019. He was buried in his family's plot at Deerfield Cemetery in South Lebanon, Ohio."

        "title": "Ultimate Tennis Showdown",
        "text": "The Ultimate Tennis Showdown (UTS) is an international individual tennis league that was founded in 2020. The competition was organized by tennis coach Patrick Mouratoglou and businessman Alex Popyrin, father of professional tennis player Alexei Popyrin, in response to the disruption of the tennis season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe first three events were held in 2020; the first two were organized at the Mouratoglou Tennis Academy in Biot near Nice and the third was held in Antwerp. In 2021, UTS returned to the Mouratoglou Academy for its fourth edition. After a two-year absence, UTS returned in July 2023 with a series of three events in the United States, Germany, and South Korea, designed to culminate in a new \"Grand Final\" at the end of the season.\nAll events use a modified scoring format, with matches divided into timed quarters. Among the features UTS has built into the tournament to differentiate the game are \"power-up cards\" that can affect the amount of points a player can accrue within a quarter.\nFormat.\nUTS matches use a different format in comparison to traditional rules, including matches being divided into timed quarters rather than sets, a 15-second shot clock for serves and the ability to take a coaching timeout once per-set, and \"cards\" — which allow players to affect the game (such as taking away the opponent's second serve). Until UTS 4, even if a player had a majority in quarters, all 4 quarters were played for averaging purposes. If two players are equal in the amount of quarters won, a 'sudden death' is played, where the first player to win two consecutive points wins the match. Introduced in UTS 4, players only have one serve per point, where lets are played; and 'KO Mode', where if a player is leading by 10 points in the quarter, it is declared over. \nThe UTS also does not enforce a code of conduct.\nUTS 1.\nThe first edition of UTS took place between June 26 and July 5, 2020.\nIn the first edition, 10 players competed in a round robin format, with the top 4 players advancing to the playoffs. \"The Hammer\" Matteo Berrettini won the event, defeating \"The Greek God\" Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final 16–15, 15–12, 12–14, 8–15, 3–2.\nRanking.\nBelow is a table showing the ranking of each competitor at the end of the round robin stage:\nUTS 2.\nThe second edition of UTS took place between July 30 and August 2, 2020. \nHere, 11 players competed. In the group stage, 8 players were placed in two groups of 4 (one was replaced midway through the tournament), where only the top players of each could qualify from each to reach the Final 4 where \"The Lion\" Alexander Zverev and \"The Panther\" Félix Auger-Aliassime had already qualified. \"The Hammer\" Matteo Berrettini was the defending champion in the men's tournament, but chose not to participate. Zverev won the event, defeating Auger-Aliassime in the final 19–10, 11–13, 10–18, 18–8, 3–1.\nThis was the first edition of UTS to have a women's tournament. 4 players participated in a playoff style format. \"The Thunder\" Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova defeated \"The Volcano\" Alizé Cornet in the final 16–8, 12–11, 11–14, 9–16, 3–1.\nUTS 3.\nThe third edition of UTS took place from October 16 to October 18, 2020. It had 2 groups of 3 players in a round-robin format, where the top players of each group advanced to the final. The Women's edition did not return.\n\"The Lion\" Alexander Zverev was the defending champion, but decided not to participate.\n\"The Demon\" Alex de Minaur won the event, defeating \"The Virtuoso\" Richard Gasquet 24–9, 15–14, 20–10 in the final.

He played college basketball for the Howard Bison between 2016 and 2020 where he became the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference's all-time leading scorer. As of 2021–22 he plays for B.B.C. Etzella in Luxembourg. \nEarly life and high school career.\nWilliams started playing basketball at age four and grew up playing in a local recreational league in Petersburg, Virginia. He drew inspiration from Kobe Bryant and was nicknamed \"Bean\" after Bryant's middle name. Williams attended Evangel Christian School in Dale City, Virginia before moving to Millwood School in Midlothian, Virginia for his sophomore season. In his first year, he was a member of Millwood's inaugural varsity basketball team. In the same season, Williams helped his team win the Virginia Independent Schools Athletic Association Division III state championship, scoring 28 points in the title game. As a senior, he was a first-team all-league selection. Williams committed to play college basketball for Howard in part because of his father's relationship with head coach Kevin Nickelberry.\nCollege career.\nIn his freshman season at Howard, Williams was named Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) Rookie of the Week seven times and scored a career-high 37 points in a 73–70 loss to Savannah State on January 28, 2017. He averaged 15.7 points per game and was named MEAC Rookie of the Year and Third Team All-MEAC. As a sophomore, he was joined in Howard's back court by R. J. Cole. Williams averaged 20.4 points per game, which ranked second in the MEAC behind Cole, and became the second fastest player to reach 1,000 career points in program history. He was named to the First Team All-MEAC. In his junior season, he averaged 17.9 points per game, finishing second in the MEAC behind Cole, and earned First Team All-MEAC honors for his second time. He declared for the 2019 NBA draft before deciding to return to Howard. On November 30, 2019, as a senior, he became Howard's all-time leading scorer after posting 13 points in a loss to Mount St. Mary's. Williams scored a season-high 34 points on January 14, 2020 in a 101–95 overtime loss to South Carolina State. On February 22, he became the all-time leading scorer in the MEAC, surpassing Delaware State's Tom Davis, who played from 1987 to 1991. In his senior season, he averaged 18.5 points and 4.3 rebounds per game and was a Second Team All-MEAC selection.\nProfessional career.\nAfter going undrafted in the 2020 NBA draft, Williams eventually signed with B.B.C. Etzella in 2021, a team in Luxembourg's Total League, the highest men's basketball league in that country.\nPersonal life.\nWilliams' father, Charles Sr., played college basketball for Virginia State. In September 2018, his mother, Michelle Watts, was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer, before eventually recovering."

        "text": "The 2020–21 Rugby Pro D2 was the second-level French rugby union club competition, behind the Top 14, for the 2020–21 season. It will run alongside the 2020–21 Top 14 competition; both competitions are operated by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR). After play was suspended following the 23rd Matchday of the 2019–20 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic in France, the season was officially cancelled without any winner or promotion/relegation on 6 May.\nCompetition format.\nThe regular season uses a double round-robin format, in which each team plays the others home and away.\nThe LNR uses a slightly different bonus points system from that used in most other rugby competitions. It trialled a new system in 2007–08 explicitly designed to prevent a losing team from earning more than one bonus point in a match, a system that also made it impossible for either team to earn a bonus point in a drawn match. LNR chose to continue with this system for subsequent seasons.\nFrance's bonus point system operates as follows:\nStarting with the 2017–18 season, Pro D2 conducts a play-off system identical to the one currently used in Top 14, with the top six teams qualifying for the play-offs and the top two teams receiving byes into the semi-finals. The winner of the play-offs earns the league championship and automatic promotion to the next season's Top 14; the runner-up enters a play-off with the second-from-bottom Top 14 team, with the winner of that play-off taking up the final place in Top 14.\nThis replaced the previous system in which the top team at the end of the regular season was declared champion, also earning a Top 14 place, while the second- through fifth-place teams competed in promotion play-offs. The play-off semi-finals were played at the home ground of the higher-ranked team. The final was then played on neutral ground, and the winner earned the second ticket to the next Top 14.\nPromotion.\nPro D2 to Top 14.\nAs noted above, both promotion places will be determined by play-offs from 2017–18 forward, with the winner of the Pro D2 play-offs earning promotion and the runner-up playing the second-from-bottom Top 14 team for the next season's final Top 14 place.\nNationale to Pro D2.\nStarting with the 2020–21 season, the FFR created a third professional league, slotting between Pro D2 and Fédérale 1 in the league system called Nationale.\nRelegation.\nNormally, the teams that finish in 15th and 16th places in the table are relegated to Nationale at the end of the season. In certain circumstances, \"financial reasons\" may cause a higher-placed team to be demoted instead, or bar a Fédérale 1 team from promotion."

        "title": "American Football Union",
        "text": "The American Football Union (AFU) was a coalition of amateur, semi-professional, and collegiate club football teams that operated from 1886 to 1895 in the New York metropolitan area. Although the minor league was practically inconsequential and obscure in the development of professional American football, the Orange Athletic Club, who participated in the league from 1888 to 1895, would go on to become the Orange and Newark Tornadoes, and join the NFL for two seasons in 1929 and 1930.\nHistory.\nFounding.\nOn January 6, 1886, representatives from several different athletic institutions across the New York metropolitan area met at 23 Dey Street in Manhattan to discuss the plausibility of a new athletic association for the sport of football. These institutions were the Staten Island, New-Brighton, Cutler, Stevens Institute, Polytechnic Institute, Brooklyn Hill, Crescent, and Victoria football clubs. The delegates of these eight athletic clubs eventually voted to form the association known as \"The American Football Union\". An election was held, and C. M. Smith of the Staten Island Cricket Club was chosen as the first AFU president. William Denman won secretary, and William H. Ford, E. P. Moorton, and R. M. Ormiston were appointed to the Executive Committee.\nThe second meeting for the fledging football association was held at 3:00 p.m. on the following Wednesday at the same site, and was focused on laying down a series of rules for the league to adopt. A committee composed of R.M Ormiston, H. C. Staniland, and H. Waldo Jr., who were the captains of the Polytechnic, Victoria, and New-Brighton athletic clubs respectively, were chosen to draft the new rules for the union. Other developments of note were arrangements for a schedule of conference matchups for the upcoming football season, as well as a trophy for whichever club won the most in-league games. A new rule was established that if any club failed to make an appearance within half an hour of their scheduled contest, they would have to forfeit the contest to the opposing team. The Brooklyn Hills and Cutler's school delegates were absent, and the Stevens Institute sent in a letter of resignation from the Union.\n1886 season.\nThe AFU's first fall meeting was held on September 31 at No.243 Broadway Street, and welcomed representatives from the five institutions who confirmed their teams for the 1886 season. They were the Unions of Columbia College, Brooklyn Hill Football Club, Cutler School, the Spartan Harriers, and the Staten Island Football Club. The Staten Island Football Club was a consolidation of three clubs on Staten Island, the Athletic, Cricket, and Rowing associations, as well as the Clifton Athletic Club. William Halsey of the Brooklyn Hills was appointed the new secretary of the AFU, and the annual dues for membership were set at $10 (roughly $275 in 2020).\nAlthough the first contest between two members of the AFU occurred on October 10, the first AFU sanctioned football game took place on October 16 with the Brooklyn Hills Football Club against the \"Crickets of Stevens\" (Stevens Institute Secondary team) at 3:30 p.m. on St. George's Cricket grounds in Hoboken, New Jersey. The Crickets won 8–6, but disputed calls by the referee resulted in the contest coming under review of the AFU Executive Committee.\nFor the 1886 season, the plan was for each of the representative teams to play each other twice, and whoever recorded the most wins would be given the Union pennant as champion of the league. However, much turmoil persisted around membership in the early AFU that strained this requirement. The Polytechnic Institute attended the first two meetings of the AFU but opted out of league-play because of an apparent lack of strength in their team. The New York Athletic Club was in negotiations with the Executive Committee but never committed to the $10 fee, and the Nassau Athletic Club applied for the Union and was denied. Although the Crescent Athletic Club was a founding member of the Union, they would not be considered a member for the 1886 season. The reason for this is unknown, but there was some speculation that the Athletic Club was too strong for the new organization, with the team composed of many Yale Alumni. On October 19 it was reported that the Spartan Harriers were withdrawing from the AFU effective immediately, and the Polytechnic Institute was to pick up the Harriers' schedule. It's unclear, but unlikely, that the Institute followed this request. The Cutlers, who had not played a single team in the AFU all season, resigned on October 24, with Brooklyn Hills appointed to play their remaining opponent, the Staten Island Football Club. The Hills would tie the club team 0–0 on November 13, Three days later, Brooklyn Hills would hold a club meeting and resign from the organization as well, citing an inability to complete their present schedule and frustration over having too many Saturday's without a conference matchup. By the end of the season, the AFU was composed of only three teams, the Crickets of the Stevens Institute, the Unions of Columbia College, and the Staten Island Football Club. A year later, this resignation would be blamed on an \"unfair decision in a disputed game\", which would elude to either their November 6 forfeit win or disputed loss to the Crickets on October 16.\nAt the first meeting of the new year, held in the office of AFU president Clarence Smith, the Crickets of Stevens Institute were officially and unanimously awarded the championship pennant for the 1886 season. The Crickets had compiled a 3–0 record in official league contests, and outscored their opponents by a total of 35 to 22. F. S. Sevenoak of the Crickets Club was elected as the new secretary and treasurer of the league after the resignation of William Halsey of the Brooklyn Football Club.\n1886 Standings.\nKey\nPPG = Average of points scored per game,\nPAG = Average of points allowed per game\n1887 season.\nThe Crescent Athletic Club was officially admitted to the AFU as a full member in April of the 1887 season. They would become the most dominant team in the Union over the next five seasons. A team was also formed by the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club, after spending a year consolidated in the Staten Island Football Club (and any players that were in the football club were then amalgamated in the cricket club). The last addition for the season was the New York Athletic Club, which entered the league to replace the Crickets of Stevens, who may have combined with the Unions of Columbia in mid-October. The Unions would last for a month before folding themselves, with some sources claiming that the team did so because of their abysmal league record. At a meeting on November 21, the AFU officially recognized the Crickets resignation from the league, but stated that the Unions of Columbia College's resignation was still \"laid out on the table\".\nWith a 6–0 record, and having not allowed a single point against them in AFU competition, the Crescent Athletic Club was officially awarded the championship pennant and the title of \"Metropolitan champion\" (in relation to the New York metropolitan area). The meeting for the ceremony was held at No 243 Broadway, in the office of Union President Clarence Smith, and was attended by representatives from the Crescent Athletic Club and Staten Island Cricket Club. The AFU was adjourned until Friday, March 7. It's unclear if there was one championship pennant that changed hands every time a new champion was crowned, or if the AFU had a new championship pennant for each season of competition.\n1888 season.\nAt the first meeting of the 1888 season, held March 29 in the office of William H. Ford at No. 51 Liberty Street, a new league constitution was adopted to replace the one drafted at the second AFU meeting in 1887. The new constitution would not be as \"loosely constructed\" as its predecessor, and barred a common practice in the league of football players shifting from one athletic club to the next throughout the season to receive more game time. Captains of participating athletic clubs were also required to present a list of all of their players for the season. Representatives were present from the New York, Crescent, and Staten Island athletic clubs. An application for admission by the recently established Orange Athletic Club was tabled until the next meeting, held on 23 May.\nWith the Orange Athletic Club membership granted in May, the AFU was up to four members, and for the first time all members would stay in the Union for the entire season. On October 10 a list was released detailing the 1888 AFU schedule, a practice that had existed since 1887 but was not published in any public newspapers until then.\nCrescent Athletic Club won the 1888 championship with a record identical to the 1887 season (6–0), and defeated the Orange Athletic Club in the AFU de facto championship on Thanksgiving to claim the pennant (which by now may have been called the Eagle Cup)\n1889 season.\nAt its annual first meeting of the 1889 season, held at No. 241 (243?) Broadway, four institutions were represented, and were the same from the previous year. With President Clarence Smith away at Saratoga, vice-president William Ford would preside over the meeting, and at the AFU's annual election, he was named the new president of the Union. T. O. Spear of the Staten Island Athletic Club was elected the new vice-president, and C. T. Schlessinger of the New York athletic club was appointed to secretary and treasurer. The Union also decided to adopt the rules of the Intercollegiate Football Association, which at that time was the leading rule-making association and governing body of early football. The Flushing and Manhattan athletic clubs submitted applications for the union, but were denied on the grounds that the present members had already formed and did not need additional associations. Fifty dollars was put aside for the purchase of the season's championship pennant. Lastly, a full schedule for the season was adopted, with each athletic club playing each other twice, and each series taking place at either team's home fields.\nOn November 2, just before the start of the 2nd half of the AFU's conference schedule, the Staten Island Athletic Club decided to withdraw from the Union, on the grounds that the men who played were businessmen and could not find time to conduct their business and practice football at the same time. This would throw the schedule into disarray, as the Staten Island team left each of the remaining members without a game. Two options presented to fill the schedule were to completely revise it to reflect the current members or to accept the applications of the Flushing or Manhattan athletic club.\nThe Crescent Athletic Club repeated as Union champions for the third consecutive season, and did not allow a single point against a current AFU member for the second time in three years. The Crescent's AFU record was 6–0 (7–1 overall, with an 18–0 loss to Yale), and outscored their union opponents by a total of 196 to 0.\n1890 season.\nIn the annual first meeting of the AFU, four congregations represented the league, including the Staten Island Athletic Club that had resigned the year prior. Unfortunately, the Staten Island team soon re-resigned, leaving only the New York, Crescent, and Orange Athletic Clubs. Manhattan Athletic Club applied for the Union, and were finally accepted, but were not allowed to compete in the league until the next season.\nOn November 8, the Crescent and Orange Athletic Clubs met at the Orange Oval in East Orange, NJ. The Crescents entered the game with a 17–0 record against AFU members since joining the Union for the 1887 season. They had also outscored their league opponents by a total of 422 to 9, and pitched fourteen shutouts. All streaks were broken when the Oranges successfully upset the three-time reigning AFU champion, 8 to 5.\nIn the championship game on December 7, a rematch of the Orange and Crescent Athletic Clubs was played. Due to new league rules, the regular season games would not play a part in the decision of AFU champion, meaning that even though the Oranges had already secured a win over the Crescents it was meaningless in relation to the championship game. The Crescent Athletic Club shut out the Orange 14 to 0 at Washington Park in Brooklyn, and secured their fourth consecutive AFU championship pennant."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Golden Flashes represent Kent State University in the NCAA's Mid-American Conference.\nKent State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1913. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Kent State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Virginia Tech's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

It was his first major title, following three previous runner-up finishes. Thiem became the first man to come back from two sets down in a US Open final in the Open Era, the first to do so overall since 1949, and the first to do so in any major final since Gastón Gaudio at the 2004 French Open. Both players served for the championship in the final set (Zverev at 5–3 and Thiem at 6–5), but both were broken at 30. This was the first time in history that the US Open title was decided by a fifth set tie-break, 50 years after the rule was introduced in 1970.\nThiem's victory made him the first Austrian to win a singles major since Thomas Muster at the 1995 French Open, the first man born in the 1990s to win a singles major, and the first new male major singles champion since Marin Čilić won the 2014 US Open. The gap between Čilić and Thiem's titles was the longest between two new major singles champions in the history of men's tennis, surpassing the previous longest gap between Juan Martín del Potro and Andy Murray respectively at the 2009 and 2012 editions of the US Open. Zverev became the youngest male finalist at a major since Novak Djokovic at the 2010 US Open.\nRafael Nadal was the reigning champion, but chose not to participate due to both safety concerns related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the short amount of time between the US Open and the rescheduled European clay season. This marked the first time since the 1999 US Open that both Nadal and Roger Federer (who was recovering from a knee surgery) were absent from a major.\nThere were no qualifiers this year. The ATP rankings valid on August 3 (being the rankings from March 16) were used to determine the main-draw entry list.\nWorld No. 1 Novak Djokovic was disqualified from the tournament during his fourth-round match against Pablo Carreño Busta. After being broken to trail 6–5 in the first set, Djokovic frustratedly hit a ball towards the baseline. This ball accidentally hit a lineswoman in the throat. Djokovic's unbeaten 26–0 2020 season, as well as his 29-match winning streak (extending back to the 2019 Davis Cup Finals), ended as a result. Djokovic became the first player to be defaulted from a major since Stefan Koubek at the 2000 French Open.\nDjokovic's ejection from the tournament guaranteed a first-time major finalist in the top half of the draw. His disqualification also meant this would be the first major since the 2004 French Open not to feature either Djokovic, Federer or Nadal in the semifinals, the first major since the 2003 Wimbledon Championships in which none of the quarterfinalists had previously won a major, and the first major men's singles tournament not to have been won by Djokovic, Federer or Nadal since Stan Wawrinka in the 2016 US Open final. This also guaranteed a first-time major champion in men's singles for the first time since the 2014 tournament. Additionally, it meant this would be the first major won by someone under the age of 30 since the 2016 Wimbledon Championships. For the first time in major history, all of the male quarterfinalists were born in the 1990s.\nSeeds.\nAll seedings per ATP rankings.\nOther entry information.\nWithdrawals.\n – not included on entry list&amp; – withdrew from entry list\nRank date: March 16, 2020"

It was her second US Open title and third major title overall. Osaka became the first player from an Asian country (excluding Russia) to win three major singles titles, the first player since Jennifer Capriati to win her first three majors in three finals appearances and, at 22 years of age, the youngest player to win three major titles since Maria Sharapova at the 2008 Australian Open. Azarenka, who was contesting her first major final since the 2013 US Open, was aiming to become the first mother to win a major singles title since Kim Clijsters won the 2011 Australian Open.\nBianca Andreescu was the reigning champion, but withdrew before the tournament due to travel concerns caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Citing safety reasons, five other top-ten players (including reigning major champions Ashleigh Barty and Simona Halep) also withdrew from the event. In all, 24 players ranked inside the top 100 were absent from the tournament. The absences of Barty and Halep, respectively world No. 1 and 2, made this the first major since the 2004 Wimbledon Championships not to feature either of the world's top two ranked players.\n29 of the 32 seeded women progressed to the second round; the most since the US Open changed from 16 seeds to 32 seeds in 2001.\nWith her first round win over Kristie Ahn, Serena Williams surpassed Chris Evert for the most match wins (102) in US Open history. Williams was attempting to equal Margaret Court's all-time record of 24 major singles titles and was also trying to set a new Open Era record by winning a seventh US Open singles title, but lost to Azarenka in the semifinals. Williams became the first player in history to reach a major semifinal in four decades: the 1990s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s. With Williams, Azarenka and Tsvetana Pironkova in the quarterfinals, it marked the first time in major history that three mothers did so. The semifinal between Williams and Azarenka was the first semifinal between two mothers in major history. This was Kim Clijsters' first (and only) major appearance since the 2012 US Open, due to her return to the sport in February 2020. Clijsters was awarded a wildcard into the main draw, but she lost to Ekaterina Alexandrova in three sets, and would retire from tennis once again in 2022.\nThere were no qualifiers this year.

Picked by the media to win the conference, the Bruins were 6–2 to start the season when senior Chris Smith suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in the win against Utah. Their best player, who was the Pac-12 Most Improved Player and a first-team All-Pac-12 selection the season prior, was ruled out for the season. The Bruins began Pac-12 conference play with a 5–0 record after beating rival Arizona on the road. This marked the fourth consecutive time UCLA had beaten Arizona in Tucson; it was also their fourth straight win against the Wildcats overall, making this the longest win streak by either team in the series since 2009. UCLA extended their conference record to 8–0 with a 61–57 road win against California. It was their best conference start since opening 9–0 in 1982–83, and the Bruins improved to 12–2 overall, including 7–0 in games decided by five points or less or which went into overtime. In their following game against Stanford, they suffered their first Pac-12 defeat after surrendering a buzzer-beating layup on an inbounds pass in a 73–72 overtime loss.\nJunior forward Jalen Hill, the team's top interior defender and among its top rebounders, left the team in early February for personal reasons. However, the Bruins added freshman forward Mac Etienne, who only enrolled in January after his prep season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. UCLA ended the regular season losing three straight. They lost the regular season finale 64–63 to USC, who made a game-winning three-point field goal with 1.4 seconds left in the game. The Bruins led by 11 at halftime and were up by eight with five minutes remaining. The loss ended their 18-game home winning streak and extended the Trojans' winning streak in their crosstown rivalry to four. UCLA played the game without their leading scorer, Juzang, who sprained his ankle. The Bruins ended with a 13–6 conference record to earn the No. 4 seed in the Pac-12 tournament. In their tourney opener in the quarterfinals, they lost 83–79 in overtime to Oregon State after leading by as many as 16 in the first half and holding a 10-point advantage at halftime. It was their fourth consecutive loss after blowing a second-half lead. Juzang returned from his injury and scored 12 points.\nUCLA was selected for the NCAA tournament, opening in the First Four against Michigan State. In a reversal, the Bruins trailed by as many as 14 in the first half and 11 at halftime before rallying to win 86–80 in overtime. Jaquez finished with a career-high 27 points in UCLA's first NCAA tournament win since 2017. This was the most-watched First Four game in tournament history, averaging 3 million viewers. They defeated BYU to advance to the second round, joining fellow Pac-12 schools Colorado, Oregon, USC, and Oregon State—the Bruins' opponents in their four consecutive losses before the tournament. After winning against Abilene Christian, UCLA became the fifth First Four team to advance to the second weekend and Sweet 16. Following their overtime win against No. 2 seed Alabama and a 51–49 triumph over No. 1 seed Michigan in the East Regional Final, the Bruins became the second First Four team to advance to the Final Four, their first national semifinal since 2008.\nIn the Final Four, UCLA faced the top-ranked team in the country in Gonzaga, who were seeking to become the first undefeated national champion since Indiana in 1976. UCLA was a 14-point underdog, the largest Final Four point spread since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985. The Bulldogs had been dominant all year, winning all but one of their 30 games by double digits, including their last 27 straight. The game was close throughout and featured 19 lead changes and 15 ties. The Bruins lost 93–90 in overtime after the Bulldogs' Jalen Suggs made a three-point bank shot as time expired. UCLA was the first opponent to hold a second-half lead against Gonzaga in the Bulldogs' first five games of the tournament. The game was the second most-watched tournament game of the season, behind the championship game, with 14.94 million viewers and a 7.6 TV rating.\nPrevious season.\nUCLA finished the season with a 19–12 record. After starting slowly at 8–9, they went on an 11–3 streak and finished second in the Pac-12 at 12–6 in conference play. Cronin was named the Pac-12 Coach of the Year, while junior Chris Smith earned first-team All-Pac-12 honors and was voted the Pac-12 Most Improved Player. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Pac-12 tournament was canceled before the Bruins' first scheduled game in the quarterfinals, and the NCAA tournament was called off as well.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| Pac-12 Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=| NCAA Tournament"

They are a member of the American Collegiate Hockey Association at the Division II level and are former members of the Pacific Coast Conference. The university sponsored varsity ice hockey from 1936 to 1940.\nHistory.\nRev. Paul Corkery S.J. wanted to attract more Canadians to Gonzaga so in 1936 the University began sponsoring ice hockey as a varsity sport. After a year the team was established enough to join the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) along with other west-coast clubs like UCLA, USC and Washington. Gonzaga also played jointly in the West Kootenai Hockey Association along with semi-professional teams from Canada. Gonzaga swiftly became one of the top teams in the PCC, winning the conference championship in each of its first two years. Gonzaga lore has the team defeating a visiting Minnesota squad by an 18–2 score, however no mention of such a result exists in Minnesota's records.\nIn 1940, Gonzaga was one of the top collegiate team in the country, going undefeated against all other colleges until losing to Toronto in the final game of the International Collegiate Championships. Gonzaga ended their program after the 1939–40 season, citing the financial drain of the program. Costs would likely have increased as most of the other PCC teams ended their programs within two years. Gonzaga's legacy, however, continued after the team was shuttered; starting goaltender Frank McCool played briefly in the NHL, winning the 1945 Calder Memorial Trophy and helping the Toronto Maple Leafs capture the Stanley Cup the same year. Another alumnus, Cheddy Thompson, would have a spectacular career as a coach with Colorado College, leading the team to a National Championship in 1950 and winning the National Coach of the Year in 1952.\nGonzaga attempted to revive the team as a varsity sport in the 1960s, but after two years the effort was abandoned and the team remained a club sport.\nSeason-by-season results.\nVarsity.\nSource:\nNote: Denny Edge became the team's coach in late December 1937.\nBulldogs in the NHL.\nSource:"

        "text": "George Fisher is an American professional basketball coach and former professional player.\nCareer.\nFisher, a 6’7’’ (2.00 m) forward, played basketball and baseball at Alhambra High School in Alhambra, California. Serving as captain of the Alhambra basketball team, he was a First Team All Pacific League and an All Temple City Tournament selection in 1962. Fisher attended the University of Utah, playing for the Utes from 1963 to 1966. He saw action in a total of 79 games, averaging 14.4 points per contest. His best season at the college level came in 1964–65, when he tallied 17.8 points a game. In the 1963–64 season, he led the Utes in rebounding with 8.7 boards per game. Fisher earned a bachelor's degree in marketing and management.\nDespite having suffered a broken femur during the 1965–66 campaign, he was selected by the New York Knicks in the 1966 NBA draft (sixth round, 51st overall). However, Fisher never played in the NBA. After the end of his college career, he coached the freshman team at the University of Utah, while recovering from his leg injury. Later, Fisher went to Milan, Italy, to play professionally and then moved to France, where he played and coached at Jœuf Homécourt Basket for eight years.\nFrom 1979 to 1989, Fisher served as head coach of Élan béarnais Orthez in France. Under his guidance, Orthez won the Korać Cup in 1984. Fisher also won two French national championships with Orthez (1986 and 1987). In 1987, he guided the team to a third-place finish in the final stage of the FIBA European Champions Cup. Over the years, his Orthez team included players like John McCullough, Paul Henderson, Howard Carter and Tom Scheffler. Fisher left Orthez in 1989. He had offers from Greece, Maccabi Tel Aviv and Real Madrid on the table, but took over the head coaching position at PSG Racing in Paris, France. He parted ways with the club during the 1989–1990 season. During his time in France, Fisher worked for the Banque Nationale de Paris as a consultant to Real Estate Asset Acquisition Managers in off-seasons. From 1991 to 1992, Fisher served as head coach of Aris Thessaloniki in Greece, where his team included players like Nikos Galis, Panagiotis Giannakis and Walter Berry.\nFisher moved back to California, he settled in Shell Beach and worked as a realtor. His former teammate at Utah, Bucky Buckwalter, later revealed, that Fisher made him aware of Arvydas Sabonis in the 1980s and also gave his insight on Dražen Petrović, when Buckwalter started considering foreign players as potential recruits for the Portland Trail Blazers who eventually drafted Sabonis in 1986."

With the Crimson now possessing a surface that could accommodate 7-on-7 hockey once more, as well as coach Clafin affirming his preference for the style, Harvard returned to its familiar style of play and began the season with a dominating win over King's College.\nThe results didn't change when Harvard began playing other US colleges and the Crimson ran roughshod over their competition. Jabish Holmes recorded four consecutive shutouts including matching 7–0 victories over rivals Princeton and Yale. The only thing that stopped Harvard from rolling to an undefeated season was a visit by the St. Patrick's Hockey Club of Ottawa, who won a pair of one-goal games in mid-February. Harvard seemed to take issue with the losses and thrashed their final two opponents, capping another championship season.\nPrinceton attempted to schedule a second game with Harvard at the Philadelphia Ice Palace but the Tigers were unsuccessful in their efforts.

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Waves represent Pepperdine University in the NCAA's West Coast Conference.\nPepperdine began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1938. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Pepperdine's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

In his 23 years with the program, Skrypek won 13 conference championships, 9 conference tournament titles and reached the NCAA Division III championship game twice.\nIn 2019 the MIAC took the unprecedented step of removing St. Thomas from its membership because of concerns about “athletic competitive parity.” Because the removal affected all sports and was effective at the end of the 2020–21 season, St. Thomas had time to decide what it would do next. The men's ice hockey program was given the green light to jump directly to the Division I level in July 2020. Before the end of the month, the seven teams who had previously announced their intention to restart the CCHA with the 2021–22 season voted unanimously to accept the Tommies as the eighth member of the conference.\nIn 2023, St. Thomas announced plans for the new Lee and Penny Anderson Arena, with the team planned to begin playing its home games there in the fall of 2025.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nAwards and honors.\nCCHA.\nAll-conference teams.\nSecond Team All-CCHA"

From 2001 an under-15 (U-15) age class was added, but this changed in 2005 to an under-13 (U-13) age class.\nThe first official edition was held in 1964 and won by Badminton Club Paramaribo with BC Amicitia ending runners-up. The last edition to date has been held by the S.B.B. in 2017 for juniors U-13 and U-17 age groups. Prior to the first official championships there was a team club event in Suriname held from 1958 - 1960 followed up by an inter-club team Cup trophy event called the Shell Badminton Cup (Shell wisselbeker Toernooi) from 1963 till 1966. These were the inaugural National Club Championships for Suriname.

Kiley made the varsity team in 1951 and helped the team finish with a 17–3 record, but they were somehow passed over for the NCAA Tournament. The following year Kiley continued to perform well for the Eagles and he helped BC in the inaugural Beanpot tournament. Though the team finished in 3rd place he was selected for the All-Tournament team. In his senior season, Kiley was again prominent during the Beanpot, this time helping Boston College win the in-season tournament, and BC finished the year with a 17–2 record. This time not only were they selected for the 1954 tournament but Kiley was the only eastern player to be selected as an AHCA First Team All-American. Unfortunately, BC's run in 1954 ended up being the worst run of any team in the history of the tournament. Minnesota throttled the Eagles 1–14 in the semifinal, the worst loss in the history of the tournament (as of 2020), then Michigan won the consolation game 7–2. As of 2020 the 1954 BC team holds several unenviable records, including the worst goal differential for a tournament and/or frozen four (-18).\nDespite the disastrous end, BC was 45–11–1 with Kiley on the team and was sorely missed after graduating with B.S. in accounting. Kiley later served in the Korean War and earned a Master's in Economics. Kiley was inducted into the Boston College Athletic Hall of Fame in 1996."

        "text": "The NSWRL Presidents Cup is a semi-professional, open-aged rugby league football competition played in New South Wales. The competition is administered by the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL). The competition includes teams from domestic rugby league clubs (mainly from the Illawarra District), Ron Massey Cup, Sydney Shield and Canterbury Cup clubs.\nHistory.\nThe Presidents Cup is a rugby league trophy which has been awarded in many competitions, governed by New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL). It was 1910 when Sir James Joynton Smith, the newly appointed President of the NSWRL, donated the trophy. Joynton Smith was the Lord Mayor of Sydney and earned a knighthood for his philanthropic work. A shrewd businessman, he was a key figure in the game up until his death in 1943.\nInitially the Presidents Cup was awarded in the Under 21 competition between representative teams from each district's junior league. It ran in this format until the mid-1990s.\nAs the top tier premiership expanded in the 1980s, and the Under 23s competition was scrapped, the Under 21s competition was expanded. In 1997, with a split competition, the ARL scrapped reserve grade, and the Under 21s served as curtain raisers to first grade games. The following year, the first year of the NRL, the Under 21s competition was scrapped, junior competitions were rationalised, and reserve grade was reintroduced under different names, including Premier League and First Division. The Presidents Cup trophy was awarded to the winner of this competition. In 2008, the centenary of rugby league in Australia, this division was renamed as the NSW Cup competition.

        "text": "Harry Eugene Miller (January 26, 1927 – February 13, 2013) was an American college basketball coach. He spent 34 years as a head coach for Western State (now Western Colorado University), Fresno State, Eastern New Mexico, North Texas, Wichita State and Stephen F. Austin.\nMiller played college basketball at Eastern New Mexico as a center, graduating in 1951. He began his coaching career at House High School in New Mexico before getting his first college head coaching job at Western State College in Gunnison, Colorado. In six seasons at Western, he compiled a record of 84 wins and 64 losses. He then moved to Division I New Mexico in 1958 as an assistant on Bob Sweeney's staff. After two seasons he moved to a successful five-year stint at Fresno State where he led the then-Division II Bulldogs to four consecutive California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA) titles from 1962 to 1965 and a record of 96–40.\nMiller was lured back to Eastern New Mexico to take over the head coaching role of his alma mater upon the recommendation of his former coach, Al Garten following Garten's retirement. In five seasons, Miler led the Greyhounds to a 104–35 record and the 1969 NAIA National Championship behind All-American Greg Hyder. The following year, Miller and Hyder led the Greyhounds back to the Final Four. Miller parlayed this success in that offseason to his first Division I coaching job, at North Texas. Following a 10-15 1970–71 season, Miller moved to Wichita State, citing better salary and facilities as reasons for the quick move. Miller led the Shockers to a 97–90 record over seven seasons (including a Missouri Valley Conference title in 1976) before being fired in 1978 due to declining attendance for the program.\nMiller spent the next ten seasons as head coach at Stephen F. Austin, compiling a record of 170–112. During his time there, the Lumberjacks made the transition to Division I, winning the program's first Division I conference championship in the 1986–87 season. Miller died on February 13, 2013, in Nacogdoches, Texas, at age 86."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Cardinals represent Ball State University in the NCAA's Mid-American Conference.\nBall State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1920. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Ball State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "David Willoughby Myers (1906 – March 5, 1997) was an American football player. He was one of the few black players in professional American football prior to World War II.\nEarly years.\nMyers was born in 1906 in New Bedford, Massachusetts, the son of Willoughby Owen Myers and Isabelle Letitia Myers. He attended Stuyvesant High School in New York City. At Stuyvesant, he starred in football and basketball, won honors as a student, and served as president of the student council.\nNYU.\nHe played college football for the NYU Violets from 1926 to 1929. He was rated as \"one of the best running guards in the game.\" Paul Gallico selected Myers as a guard on his 1928 All-America team. Myers also threw the javelin for NYU's track team and set a metropolitan New York record with a distance of 202 feet, 11 inches.\nIn October 1929, he was moved from the guard position to become NYU's starting quarterback. One week later, reports surfaced that NYU had reached a \"gentleman's agreement\" to bench Myers for a scheduled game with the University of Georgia. The NAACP sent a letter of protest, and the chairman of NYU's athletic control board followed with a statement denying any such agreement and stating, \"If we thought Georgia would show such poor sportsmanship as to demand Myers' removal from the lineup we would cancel our contract with the southern school.\" Gallico also wrote a column advocating that NYU play Myers. In the end, NYU agreed not to play Myers when Georgia refused to participate if Myers played. In response to the decision, Heywood Broun called NYU a \"gutless college with a gutless coach.\" The game proceeded, and, despite demands from NYU fans in the stands, Myers did not play.\nProfessional football.\nHe played professional football in the National Football League (NFL) as a guard and halfback for the Staten Island Stapletons (1930) and Brooklyn Dodgers (1931). He appeared in 13 NFL games, 11 as a starter. He also played for the Clifton Wessingtons of the Interstate Football League in 1933 and for the Churchill Pros in 1941.\nLater years.\nMyers worked for the New York Department of Welfare's Division of Special Investigations.\nHe died in 1997 at age 90 in Presque Isle, Maine."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Bonnies represent St. Bonaventure University in the NCAA Division I Atlantic 10 Conference.\nSt. Bonaventure began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1919. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a statistic in Division I until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but St. Bonaventure's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "title": "2022 Real Tennis World Championship",
        "text": "The 2022 Real Tennis World Championship was a real tennis tournament held at Prested Hall in Feering, Essex, England in September 2022. Rob Fahey, the 13-time and reigning world champion, was beaten by the challenger, and former champion, Camden Riviere. The challenge had been originally scheduled to take place in April 2020, but was postponed to September 2022 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nQualification.\nAs the defending champion, Robert Fahey qualified directly to the World Championship Challenge. The challenger was determined through a series of eliminator matches. Qualification to the eliminator matches was based on results in major tournaments in 2018 and 2019. Four players were declared eligible to compete:\nFormer champion Riviere returned to the eliminators, having previously won the right to challenge on three occasions: 2008, 2014 and 2016. He did not participate in the eliminator process in 2018 as he was the defending champion. Despite a period away from the sport recovering from Lyme disease, he still managed to complete a Grand Slam in 2019. Alongside Tim Chisholm, he also retained the Doubles World Championship in Hobart in 2019.\nChapman qualified for the eliminators for a second consecutive cycle, having lost to Steve Virgona in the first round in 2018. Since the previous cycle, he won his first major open at the 2018 French Open, albeit in the absence of Riviere. In the same year, he also reached the final in the Australian and British Opens, rising through the rankings to a career-best number 3 spot. He also moved from his previous role at Hampton Court Palace to his native Melbourne.\nTaylor-Matthews returned to the qualifiers for the first time since 2012, where he lost in the first round to Bryn Sayers. During the qualification period, he reached the final of the 2018 French Open; the first such appearance in a major singles tournament. He also won the doubles alongside John Lumley in the same tournament.\nHowell qualified to the eliminators for the first time. He reached the finals of a major Open for the first time at the 2018 Australian Open. Alongside Rob Fahey, he won doubles titles at the 2018 Australian Open and the 2018 British Open and challenged for the 2019 Doubles World Championship.\nEliminators.\nThe format for the first round eliminators was unchanged from the previous year. However, the final eliminator was changed from a series of up to three home and away best-of-five set matches to a single best-of-thirteen set match at a single venue, mimicking the Challenge itself. In previous years, the matches were held on a home and away basis as three best-of-five set matches.\nThe venues for the first round eliminators were chosen via a bidding process. Each player had the right to put in a bid for their chosen court. The hosting rights of the Riviere-Howell match were won by The Oratory School in Woodcote, Oxfordshire. The right for the Chapman-Taylor Matthews match were won by the Royal Melbourne Tennis Club\nFirst round eliminators.\nThe first eliminator was held at The Oratory School in Woodcote, Oxfordshire between Nick Howell and Camden Riviere. The court had previously hosted the 2006 World Championship. Howell was an alumni from the school alongside his brother, Gloucestershire cricketer Benny Howell, while his father Jonathan Howell was formerly a real tennis professional at the school. The match was scheduled for two days, with a rest day in between, however if either player won four sets on the first day, they could elect to play the fifth set on the first day as well, negating the need for a second day. Indeed, Riviere was in top form, and won through the match in straight sets in a single day, although the capacity-crowd was supporting the local favourite.\nThe other eliminator was hosted by the Royal Melbourne Tennis Club, the new home court of Chris Chapman. Held following the Australian Open and Boomerang tournament, it was a close fought match with both players trading sets all the way through. After the first day, the match was tied at two sets apiece. The following day was tight as well, but Chapman managed to hold on to the eight set to win through to the final eliminator\nFinal eliminator.\nThe final eliminator was a match between Riviere and Chapman. The match was played at the Tennis and Racquet Club in Boston, Massachusetts, the home court of Camden Riviere. The match was scheduled over three days but ultimately concluded in two. Chapman was only able to win a single set on the second day, as Riviere cruised to a 7–1 win.\nWorld challenge.\nThe 2022 World Championship Challenge was held as a best-of-13 set match between defending champion Robert Fahey and former champion Camden Riviere. In March 2019, the venue for the challenge was announced as Prested Hall in Feering, Essex. At the time of announcement, it was the home court of Robert Fahey, although he and his wife Claire would move to The Oratory School in September 2020.\nIt was the first time that Prested Hall will host a Singles World Championship, although it did host the Doubles World Championship in 2017 where Camden Riviere and Tim Chisholm defeated Robert Fahey and Ricardo Smith. The only previous singles experience Camden Riviere has at Prested Hall was an IRTPA National League match against Ricardo Smith in 2007.\nThe pair have previously met in each of the last three World Championship challenges, two of which were won by Fahey, and one by Riviere. Their first meeting was in Fontainebleau, France in 2008, which was Riviere's first challenge. Then, Riviere had never before beaten Fahey, but gave a strong showing to win five sets from Fahey. They would next meet in Melbourne, Australia in 2014. Again, Fahey successfully defended his championship 7–3. Riviere won his first championship at his then-home club of Newport, Rhode Island in 2016. Fahey successfully challenged back for the championship in 2018 at Queen's Club, London two days prior to his 50th birthday. Apart from the two World Championship losses in 2014 and 2018, Riviere has defeated Fahey at every encounter since 2013. In 2019, Riviere completed the second Grand Slam (real tennis) of his career, although he missed several tournaments in 2018 and early 2020 due to recurring Lyme disease. Fahey completed his 50th career Major singles Open at the 2019 British Open, although Riviere was not present at that tournament. Prior to the match, Fahey revealed that he does not intend to challenge or defend his title after 2021, citing age and the effect of playing on his ankles.\nImpact due to COVID-19.\nOn 12 March 2020, the IRTPA World Championship committee announced that the World Championships would not proceed in April 2020 as originally intended due to the government regulations relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. An initial date of October 2020 was proposed. On 17 March 2020, the Tennis and Racquets Association announced that all national real tennis tournaments in the United Kingdom as well as the 2020 French Open would be cancelled or postponed. From 25 March onward, all recreational level real tennis had ceased in Australia, France, the United States and the United Kingdom. Citing uncertainty around mass gatherings and spectators, the IRTPA World Championship committee announced a further postponement to May 2020. In February 2021, the final was pushed back again to September 2022.\nDay 1.\nThe match was preceded by a minute of silence as the United Kingdom was in the mourning period following the death of Elizabeth II. The match was marked by Andrew Lyons, professional at the Seacourt Tennis Club. As in the previous World Championship in 2018, the first set was won by Fahey, lasting nearly an hour. Fahey had recovered from 2/4 down with three consecutive games. Riviere started strong in the second set, building a 3/0 lead as Fahey started aiming for the targets of the grille and dedans. Through a strong cut volley, Fahey punished any weak serves to win the third set from behind and guarantee that the match would go to a third day. Riviere took the final set quickly, leaving the day at 2-all.\nDay 2.\nRiviere took the momentum in the second day with improved serving accuracy and trademark floor speed. He was able to string several consecutive games together to win each of the first three sets of the day and take a 4/0 lead in the fourth. But a late surge from Fahey brought the score back to 5/5. After a dramatic point called a let where a spectator called from the galleries during play, Fahey took the final game of the day and the eighth set of the match\nDay 3.\nNeeding only two more sets to win, Riviere ran away with the ninth set as Fahey wasn't able to dominate on the serve. However, momentum swung his way in the tenth set, as Fahey built a solid lead throughout the set, the first two-game lead since the first day. In the eleventh set, Riviere built a lead to 5/3 - one game away from the championship, but a steely Fahey saved several championship points until he had two set points of his own, which he converted. Finally, Riviere took the championship in the twelfth set, as Fahey faded towards the end of the match. "

        "text": "Skeleton Coast is a 1987 South African made mercenary war film directed by John Cardos in the first of three films for producer Harry Alan Towers. It was the first of Towers' Breton Film Productions.\nPlot.\nDuring the Angolan Civil War CIA agent Michael Smith is working with UNITA rebels. He is captured by the Angolan Armed Forces and sent to a prison to be interrogated by an East German named Major Schneider. Smith's father, retired US Marine Corps Colonel Bill Smith has no faith in the United States Government freeing his son. The Colonel travels to South West Africa where he pays the mysterious Elia for accurate information about his son's location of captivity. Colonel Smith hires seven mercenaries that he will lead into Angola to rescue his son.\nCaptain Simpson, the leader of a security force of a diamond mine has a man keeping his eye on the Colonel fearing that he may be a diamond smuggler. Elia's wife Opal is carrying on an illicit relationship with Simpson and informs him that the Colonel murdered his security man, in reality he was murdered by Rick Weston, the leader of Smith's private army. Rick informed the Colonel he was an Angolan secret agent. Elia then discovered that either Col. Smith paid him in counterfeit money or the money was replaced with counterfeit money in his safe. Entering Angola, the mercenaries team up with Sekassi, the Jonas Savimbi type leader of the rebels to support their rescue of Michael Smith.\nProduction.\nNadia Caillou, the daughter of screenwriter and author Alan Caillou, made her screenwriting debut in the film. She had previously acted in John Cardos's 1977 film \"Kingdom of the Spiders\". Cardos claimed Harry Alan Towers reedited the film that destroyed the continuity of the story.\nTullio Moneta was second-in-command to Mike Hoare when the latter led the 1981 Seychelles coup d'état attempt at Mahe Airport in the Seychelles and was sentenced to five years in prison in November 1981.\nArnold Vosloo married his co-star Nancy Mulford in 1988. They divorced in 1991."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Braves represent Alcorn State University in the NCAA's Southwestern Athletic Conference.\nAlcorn State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1945. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Alcorn State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "The 2016 Real Tennis World Championship was a real tennis tournament held at the National Tennis Club in Newport, Rhode Island. 12-time world champion Rob Fahey lost the championship for the first time since 1994 to challenger Camden Riviere by a score of 7–2.\nQualification.\nAs the defending champion, Robert Fahey qualified directly to the World Championship Challenge. The challenger was determined through a series of eliminator matches. Qualification to the eliminator matches was based on results in major tournaments in 2014 and 2015. Four players were declared eligible to compete:\nSayers opted not to participate in the first round eliminator, meaning that Riviere proceeded directly to the final eliminator.\nRiviere had previously challenged for the world championship on two occasions, in 2008 and most recently in 2014, both times losing to defending champion Robert Fahey. He missed the 2012 challenge due to injury. During the qualification period, he won five Major Opens, including his first wins at the Australian and British Opens. Since 2013, he was ranked number one in the world rankings.\nVirgona had qualified to be the World Championship challenger on two occasions: first in 2010 in Melbourne and again in 2012 at the Queen's Club, losing both times to Fahey. In 2014, he lost at the final eliminator stage to Riviere. During the qualification period, he won his seventh open title at the 2015 British Open as well as reached the final of three other Major Opens.\nChisholm had previously challenged three times for the world championship, all in the early 2000s. Each time, he lost to incumbent champion Robert Fahey. Although he had not won an open since 2004, he did reach the final of the 2015 British Open. Alongside Riviere, he won his first World Doubles Championship at his home club of Tuxedo in 2015.\nEliminators.\nDue to Sayer's absence, Riviere received direct entry to the final eliminator. The first round would be held as a home-and-away format between the two qualified players. The final eliminator would be held at a single venue following a bidding process.\nIn the first round, both players opted to play at their home courts. As Virgona was ranked higher, the second and third match (if required) would be played at his home court of Chicago, while the first match would be played Tuxedo, the home court of Chisholm. The hosting right of the final eliminator was won by the Racquet Club of Philadelphia. \nFirst Round Eliminator.\nThe first match was a narrow fought five set affair, with Virgona winning a close fifth set at Chisholm's home court. On the second leg at Virgona's home court, Virgona won in straight sets.\nFinal Eliminator.\nThe Final Eliminator was hosted over three days at the Racquet Club of Philadelphia. On each of the first two days, Riviere won three sets to one for Virgona. Riviere needed just one set on the final day to qualify for the Championship challenge, which he did comfortably.\nWorld Challenge.\nThe 2016 World Championship Challenge was held as a best-of-13 set match between defending champion Robert Fahey and world number 1 Camden Riviere. The venue for the challenge the National Tennis Club at the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, the home court of Camden Riviere. It was the second time that the National Tennis Club had hosted the World Championship. The previous challenge in Newport was in 2004, where Fahey successfully defended against Tim Chisholm. The venue also regularly hosts the US Pro Singles, otherwise known as the Schochet Cup. Their last meeting at the venue was at the 2014 US Pro Singles, where Riviere won in 4 sets.\nThe pair had previously met in twice in World Championship Challenges, all of which featured Fahey as the defending champion. Their first meeting was in Fontainebleau, France in 2008, which was Riviere's first challenge. Then, Riviere had never before beaten Fahey, but gave a strong showing to win five sets from Fahey. Their second meeting was at the Melbourne, Australia in 2014. Again, Fahey successfully defended his championship 7–3. Since then, the pair had only met twice, first at the 2014 US Pro at the National Tennis Club in Newport, Rhode Island, and the 2015 US Open in Boston, both times Riviere won in 4 sets. Since the last World Championships, Fahey had also won the 2014 Australian Open and 2015 French Open.\nDay 1.\nThe match was marked by Andrew Lyons, the head professional at the Queen's Club. The match started evenly, but Riviere soon found a winning streak, racing from 3-all in the first set, to win it 6/4 and take a 3 game lead into the second set. The match evened up, with Riviere holding his advantage to take the second set as well. Fahey took an early lead in the third, but Riviere surged back to win five games without reply and a three set lead. The fourth set was close all the way through, with Fahey holding on to bring the score back to 3-1.\nDay 2.\nRiviere took an early lead in the fifth set, and although Fahey started to match Riviere, the advantage was enough for Riviere to take the first set. It was a similar outcome in the sixth set. Finally, in the seventh, Fahey took an advantage and despite Riviere drawing level, managed to win his second set of the match, thus pushing the match into a third day. The final set of the day see-sawed between both players, with Riviere ultimately the winner.\nDay 3.\nAs with the final eliminator, Riviere needed just one set on the third day to win the match. He did that comfortably, taking the set 6/2 after establishing a solid 5/1 lead.\nResult.\nRiviere won the match 7-2 to become the 25th person to hold the title of Real Tennis World Champion. He was the first American to hold the title since Jimmy Bostwick in 1974. It was the first time that Fahey had lost a World Championship challenge, after winning 12 consecutive titles from 1994 to 2014."

More specifically, via closed-circuit television, DirecTV, the DISH Network, and iNDemand cable pay-per-view. Viewers had the option of paying $20 per match, or $149 for the entire tournament.

        "title": "Equestrian statue of Francisco Franco",
        "text": "The equestrian statue of Francisco Franco was an instance of public art in Madrid, Spain. The statue, depicting dictator Francisco Franco riding a horse, was removed from its location in Nuevos Ministerios and subsequently stored in March 2005.\nHistory and description.\nA work by , the bronze was cast in 1956. The sculptor reportedly found inspiration in the Donatello's equestrian statue of Gattamelata. Initially intended to top the Arco de la Victoria, following the refusal of Franco to have his equestrian statue put on the triumphal arch, the Complutense University of Madrid donated the statue to the Ministry of Housing. Transferred to plaza de San Juan de la Cruz, next to the Nuevos Ministerios, it was unveiled on 18 July 1959. The statue spawned two replicas, sent to Santander and Valencia's respective \"plazas del Generalísimo\".\nThe ensemble had a total height of 7.5 m.\nOver the years, the monument became a meeting point of Francoists every 20 November, while it also became the target for tagging carried out by left-wing sympathizers. Meanwhile the different public administrations denied ownership of the statue and therefore they avoided responsibility for its withdrawal.\nIn the early morning of 17 March 2005, employees of the Tragsa company upon request of the Subsecretariat of the Ministry of Public Works removed the statue from the plinth during an operative that took some hours. It was reportedly a decision of Minister Magdalena Álvarez. The Mayor of Madrid, Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón, told he was not aware of the intentions of the ministry regarding the fate of the statue.\nThe statue was stored in ministerial premises located in the calle de Gregorio Benítez.\nThe day after the removal a group of 700 far-right militants—including Blas Piñar—gathered around the empty pedestal to give a bizarre farewell to Franco, singing a \"Hail Mary\" and the \"Cara al Sol\", also inveighing against the Government of Spain, the People's Party, and, most acrimoniously, against José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero and Santiago Carrillo, while also trying to vandalise the nearby statues of Indalecio Prieto and Largo Caballero. The police proceeded then to break up the rally.\nSoon after the removal, the conservative newspaper \"ABC\" published an editorial arguing that \"it would be dangerous for socialism to fall into the revanchist temptation to try to claim back now, retroactively, part of a cession it made thirty years ago in a Spain that is not the Spain of the past and which, fortunately, has stripped itself of all the ghosts of the past.\" Meanwhile, former Francoist honcho José Utrera Molina—from the platform \"La Razón\" granted him—wrote against the removal of statues, arguing that \"Franco still rides serene and majestic in the air of history\". Vandal attacks against the statue of Largo Caballero still ensued in the days following the removal.\nThe only remaining element of the monument still on-site, the 3-metre high stone plinth, was retired by August 2006.\nAfter the events, one individual and the Francisco Franco National Foundation (FNFF) filed for an administrative lawsuit intending to litigate against the removal. In 2009, the Higher Court of Justice of Madrid determined that the Ministry of Public Works had bypassed the historical heritage law, yet the Court also ruled out enforcing the reposition as it would violate the Law of Historical Memory."

        "text": "The Czech Baseball Extraliga, or simply Extraliga, is the highest level of baseball in the Czech Republic. The league was established in 1993 after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. The league is currently contested by eight teams and the games are played from April to May with the playoffs beginning in June. \nThe Extraliga operates a promotion and relegation system with the 1. Liga (the second tier baseball league in Czech Republic) where the bottom teams from the Extraliga are relegated to the 1. Liga and the top teams from the 1. Liga are promoted to the Extraliga.\nHistory.\nThe Czechoslovak Baseball League was established in 1979, and Tempo Praha became the first baseball champions. However, in 1993, after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, the league was disbanded and the Czech Baseball Extraliga was established, comprising teams only from the Czech Republic.\nThe first Extraliga champions were Technika Brno, winners of the 1993 and 1994 seasons. Draci Brno rapidly became the dominant team in the league, winning every season from 1995 to 2010 and eight more times after that, totalling 24 championships, the most recent in 2023. In recent years, Arrows Ostrava won two championships back to back in 2018 and 2019 and again in 2021, becoming the second most winning team in the Extraliga, tied with Technika Brno.\nThe Extraliga was one of the first sports leagues in Europe, and the first major baseball league in the world, to restart following lockdowns concerning the COVID-19 pandemic.\nForeign players.\nSince 2016, the Extraliga allows a maximum of five foreign players on a team roster and there is a limit of three foreigners in the team's lineup at the same time during a game. This changed during 2020, when, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign players were banned, except for residents of the Czech Republic. This ban was lifted for the 2021 season and the rules remained as they were before 2020.\nNotable Extraliga foreign players include some former major leaguers. Panamanian pitcher Roger Deago played for Technika Brno in 1997 and 1998 before signing as an amateur free agent by the San Diego Padres in 2002 and making his Major League Baseball debut in 2003; Deago returned to Technika for the 2011 season. In 2019, Draci Brno signed Australian pitcher Peter Moylan, who played 11 games, winning three and losing one.\nHistorically, the majority of foreign players in the Extraliga come from North America, Latin America and Australia."

As of the next college basketball season in 2024–25, the Trojans represent the University of Southern California in the NCAA Division I Big Ten Conference.\nUSC began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1906. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but USC's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "Maurice Michael Fitzgerald (12 March 1917 – 1 June 1942) was an Australian rugby league footballer who played in the New South Wales Rugby League for Balmain. He died during the Second World War.\nEarly life and rugby career.\nFitzgerald was born on 12 March 1917 in Forest Lodge to Thomas and Dorothy Elizabeth Fitzgerald. He attended Holy Cross College in Ryde from 1933 to 1935, in which time he became the captain of the school's basketball team. In 1936, Fitzgerald appeared 3 times as a loose forward for Balmain, scoring 3 points and 1 try in 3 appearances.\nPersonal life and military career.\nFitzgerald worked as a clerk. During the Second World War, he enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force in Sydney on 3 February 1941, applying to become aircrew soon after. In May 1941, ranked leading aircraftman, Fitzgerald was transported to Canada under the Empire Air Training Scheme, where he practiced as an observer and air gunner at No.2 Air Observer School, Edmonton. Ultimately being assigned as an observer, Fitzgerald was attached to the Royal Air Force and embarked by ship to England in October 1941, arriving on 1 November.\nOn 1 June 1942, Sergeant Fitzgerald and the other 5 crew members on board Vickers Wellington \"Z1311\" took off from RAF Breighton to take part in the thousand-bomber raid on Essen. Over Hainaut, German-occupied Belgium, \"Z1311\" was shot down by a German Messerschmit Bf 110 night fighter piloted by \"Oberleutnant\" Reinhold Eckardt of \"Nachtjagdgeschwader 3\". The aircraft crashed near Binche, killing all aboard. Originally cited as missing in action, Fitzgerald was declared presumed dead on 26 December 1942. The crew's remains were eventually found, and all were buried at Charleroi Communal Cemetery."

The Cowboys represent Oklahoma State University in the NCAA's Big 12 Conference.\nOklahoma State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1907. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Oklahoma State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

He earned a degree in media communications.\nProfessional career.\nNew York Giants.\nAfter going undrafted in the 2017 NFL draft, Thompson signed with the New York Giants as a priority free agent on May 1 because he liked the organization.

He played tight end and special teams for the Iron before the league folded after Week 8. \"This league, I thought, was great and I thought this would make it and break the trend of minor league football not making it. I enjoyed my time here,\" Thompson said of his experience in the AAF. Thompson worked as a host on 97.3 ESPN radio and a sideline reporter for Temple Owls football games.\nTampa Bay Vipers.\nThompson was selected by the Tampa Bay Vipers of the XFL in the open phase of the 2020 XFL Draft on October 16, 2019. Ron Selesky, the Vipers' director of operations and who held the same role with the Birmingham Iron, recommended Thompson to Vipers tight end coach Pete Mangurian, who invited him to try out for the team. On March 1, 2020, during a game against the DC Defenders, Thompson made an acrobatic catch and fell forward for a 13-yard gain after DC safety Rahim Moore deflected the ball in the air. The XFL season was suspended after Week 5 due to the coronavirus pandemic, and Thompson said he thoroughly enjoyed the experience. He had his contract terminated when the league suspended operations on April 10, 2020.\nCarolina Panthers.\nOn April 27, 2020, the Carolina Panthers signed Thompson, reuniting him with former Temple head coach Matt Rhule and former Temple teammates P. J. Walker, Robby Anderson, and Keith Kirkwood. He was waived on September 5, 2020, but re-signed two days later after Keith Kirkwood was placed on injured reserve. Thompson scored a touchdown on the first touch of his NFL career, a pass from Teddy Bridgewater in the first quarter of Carolina's Week 10 matchup against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Thompson signed a one-year contract extension with the Panthers on January 4, 2021.\nOn December 14, 2021, Thompson was waived by the Panthers and re-signed to the practice squad.

His brother, Kerry, is a former high school All American in Swimming. His mother is a high school friend of Thompson's Birmingham Iron coach, Tim Lewis. She owns Cotton Company and Lace Silhouettes Lingerie in the Washington Street Mall in Cape May, New Jersey, while his father is a realtor.

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Greyhounds represent Loyola University Maryland in the NCAA's Patriot League.\nLoyola began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1908. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Loyola's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "The 2020–21 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase and play-off round began on 8 August and ended on 30 September 2020.\nA total of 53 teams competed in the qualifying system of the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League, which includes the qualifying phase and the play-off round, with 43 teams in Champions Path and 10 teams in League Path. The six winners in the play-off round (four from Champions Path, two from League Path) advanced to the group stage, to join the 26 teams that enter in the group stage.\nTimes are CEST (), as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses).\nTeams.\nChampions Path.\nThe Champions Path includes all league champions which do not qualify directly for the group stage, and consists of the following rounds:\nAll teams eliminated from the Champions Path enter the Europa League:\nBelow are the participating teams of the Champions Path (with their 2020 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their starting rounds.\nLeague Path.\nThe League Path includes all league non-champions which do not qualify directly for the group stage, and consists of the following rounds:\nAll teams eliminated from the League Path enter the Europa League:\nBelow are the participating teams of the League Path (with their 2020 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their starting rounds.\nFormat.\nIn a change to the format as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, each tie prior to the play-off round is played as a single-legged match hosted by one of the teams decided by draw, except for the preliminary round which is played at neutral venue. If scores are level at the end of normal time, extra time is played, followed by a penalty shoot-out if the scores remain tied.\nThe play-off round ties are played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scores more goals on aggregate over the two legs advances to the next round. If the aggregate score is level, the away goals rule is applied, i.e. the team that scores more goals away from home over the two legs advances. If away goals are also equal, then extra time is played. The away goals rule is again applied after extra time, i.e. if there are goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score is still level, the visiting team advances by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals are scored during extra time, the tie is decided by a penalty shoot-out.\nIn each draw, teams are seeded based on their 2020 UEFA club coefficients. For any team whose club coefficients are not final at the time of a draw, their club coefficients at that time, taking into account of all 2019–20 UEFA Champions League and Europa League matches played up to that point, are used (Regulations Article 13.03). Teams are divided into seeded and unseeded pots containing the same number of teams, and a seeded team is drawn against an unseeded team. For each tie, a draw is made between the two teams, and the first team drawn is the home team in single-legged matches (or the administrative \"home\" team in preliminary round matches), or home team of the first leg in play-off round two-legged ties. If the identity of the winners of the previous round is not known at the time of the draws, the seeding is carried out under the assumption that the team with the higher coefficient of an undecided tie advances to this round, which means if the team with the lower coefficient is to advance, it simply takes the seeding of its opponent. Teams from associations with political conflicts as decided by UEFA may not be drawn into the same tie. Prior to the draws, UEFA may form \"groups\" in accordance with the principles set by the Club Competitions Committee and based on geographical, logistical and political reasons, and they are purely for convenience of the draw and do not resemble any real groupings in the sense of the competition.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, all qualifying matches are played behind closed doors. The following special rules are applicable to the qualifying phase and play-offs:\nFour countries (Poland, Hungary, Greece and Cyprus) have provided neutral venue hubs which allow matches to be played at their stadiums without restrictions.\nSchedule.\nThe schedule of the competition is as follows (all draws are held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland). The tournament would originally have started in June 2020, but had been delayed to August due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. The new schedule was announced by the UEFA Executive Committee on 17 June 2020.\nThe original schedule of the competition, as planned before the pandemic, was as follows (all draws held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, unless stated otherwise).\nPreliminary round.\n&lt;section begin=PR /&gt;\nThe draw for the preliminary round was held on 17 July 2020, 12:00 CEST.&lt;section end=PR /&gt;\nSeeding.\nA total of four teams played in the preliminary round. As the draw was held before the UEFA entry deadline and the participating teams were not yet confirmed, only the associations of the teams were used, and seeding of teams was based on their association coefficients instead of their club coefficients. For the semi-final round, two teams (from associations 52 and 53, Northern Ireland and Kosovo) were seeded and two teams (from associations 54 and 55, Andorra and San Marino) were unseeded. The first team drawn in each tie in the semi-final round and the final round would be the administrative \"home\" team.\nSummary.\n&lt;section begin=PR /&gt;\nThe semi-finals were played on 8 August at the Colovray Stadium in Nyon, Switzerland. The final was due to be played at the same venue on 11 August but the match was cancelled due to Drita players being put into quarantine after two players had tested positive for SARS-2 coronavirus, and Linfield were awarded a technical 3–0 win.\n&lt;section end=PR /&gt;\nFirst qualifying round.\n&lt;section begin=Q1 /&gt;\nThe draw for the first qualifying round was held on 9 August 2020, 12:00 CEST.&lt;section end=Q1 /&gt;\nSeeding.\nA total of 34 teams played in the first qualifying round: 33 teams which entered in this round, and 1 winner of the preliminary round. Seeding of teams was based on their 2020 UEFA club coefficients. For the winner of the preliminary round, whose identity was not known at the time of draw, the club coefficient of the highest-ranked remaining team was used. The first team drawn in each tie would be the home team.\nSummary.\n&lt;section begin=Q1 /&gt;\nThe matches were played on 18 and 19 August 2020. The match between KÍ and Slovan Bratislava was cancelled due to Slovan Bratislava players being put into quarantine after one player had tested positive for SARS-2 coronavirus, and KÍ were awarded a technical 3–0 win.\n&lt;section end=Q1 /&gt;\nSecond qualifying round.\n&lt;section begin=Q2 /&gt;\nThe draw for the second qualifying round was held on 10 August 2020, 12:00 CEST.&lt;section end=Q2 /&gt;\nSeeding.\nA total of 26 teams played in the second qualifying round. They were divided into two paths:\nSeeding of teams was based on their 2020 UEFA club coefficients. For the winners of the first qualifying round, whose identity was not known at the time of draw, the club coefficient of the highest-ranked remaining team in each tie was used. The first team drawn in each tie would be the home team.\nSummary.\n&lt;section begin=Q2 /&gt;\nThe matches were played on 25 and 26 August 2020.\nThird qualifying round.\n&lt;section begin=Q3 /&gt;\nThe draw for the third qualifying round was held on 31 August 2020, 12:00 CEST.&lt;section end=Q3 /&gt;\nSeeding.\nA total of 16 teams played in the third qualifying round. They were divided into two paths:\nSeeding of teams was based on their 2020 UEFA club coefficients. The first team drawn in each tie would be the home team.\nSummary.\n&lt;section begin=Q3 /&gt;\nThe matches were played on 15 and 16 September 2020.\nPlay-off round.\n&lt;section begin=PO /&gt;\nThe draw for the play-off round was held on 1 September 2020, 12:00 CEST.&lt;section end=PO /&gt;\nSeeding.\nA total of 12 teams played in the play-off round. They were divided into two paths:\nSeeding of teams was based on their 2020 UEFA club coefficients. For the winners of the third qualifying round, whose identity was not known at the time of draw, the club coefficient of the highest-ranked remaining team in each tie was used. The first team drawn in each tie would be the home team of the first leg.\nSince Russian and Ukrainian teams may not be drawn into the same tie for political reasons, the winners of the match involving Benfica had to play Krasnodar, and the winners of the match involving Dynamo Kyiv had to play the winners of the match involving Gent.\nSummary.\n&lt;section begin=PO /&gt;\nThe first legs were played on 22 and 23 September, and the second legs were played on 29 and 30 September 2020.\nChampions Path.\n\"Midtjylland won 4–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"Red Bull Salzburg won 5–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"Olympiacos won 2–0 on aggregate.\"\n\"3–3 on aggregate. Ferencváros won on away goals.\"\nLeague Path.\n\"Krasnodar won 4–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"Dynamo Kyiv won 5–1 on aggregate.\""

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. As of the next college basketball season in 2024–25, the Buffaloes represent the University of Colorado Boulder in the NCAA Division I Big 12 Conference.\nColorado began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1900. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Colorado's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

        "text": "The Nebraska Cornhuskers baseball team competes as part of NCAA Division I, representing the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in the Big Ten Conference.\nIn its early years, Nebraska's program cycled through head coaches, most of whom led the program for a single year. The Cornhuskers competed as an independent until 1929, when John Rhodes led the team to the Big Six championship. W. W. Knight, hired forty-four years after the program's first season of competition, was Nebraska's first head coach to hold the position for more than three years.\nAfter decades of heavy coaching turnover, the hire of Tony Sharpe in 1947 brought stability to the program for the first time; Sharpe and his successor John Sanders led Nebraska for a combined fifty-one years. However, this consistency did not translate to on-field success, as the two coaches combined for just three NCAA Tournament appearances. NU's first national success arrived with the hire of Dave Van Horn in 1998, who took the program to its first College World Series appearances in 2001 and 2002. When Van Horn resigned to return to his alma mater Arkansas after the 2002 season, assistant Mike Anderson succeeded him and led NU to a program-record fifty-seven wins and another College World Series appearance in 2005.\nNebraska has been coached by Will Bolt since 2020."

        "text": "The 2022 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 92nd Major League Baseball All-Star Game, held between the American League (AL) and the National League (NL) of Major League Baseball (MLB). The game was hosted by the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium. The game was played on July 19, broadcast nationally by Fox television and ESPN Radio.\nThe American League defeated the National League 3–2, for its ninth straight All-Star Game win.\nCoincidentally, the previous time Dodger Stadium hosted the game in 1980, that year's result gave the National League its ninth straight win as well.\nBackground.\nHost selection.\nThe Dodgers were awarded the 2022 MLB All-Star Game after the 2020 contest, which they were originally scheduled to host, was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. This marked the first time in 42 years (and fourth time overall) that the Dodgers hosted an All-Star Game, the previous occurrences being in 1949 at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn (when the franchise played as the Brooklyn Dodgers), 1959 at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, and 1980 at Dodger Stadium.\nRoster selections.\nThe starting rosters for each league's position players plus designated hitter (DH) were determined by fan balloting, which was conducted in two phases. New in 2022, the first-phase top vote-getter for each league automatically received a spot in the starting lineup. The top two vote-getters for every other non-pitching position and DH advanced to the second phase of voting. There are normally six finalists for the three outfield positions in each league, except when an outfielder is the top vote-getter, in which case there are four finalists for the remaining two outfield positions. Voting does not carry over between phases.\nFirst phase voting was held from June 8 through June 30, and second phase voting was held from July 5 through July 8. All voting was conducted online, at MLB.com or via the MLB app. Starting players, as selected via voting, were announced on July 8. Reserve position players and all pitchers—selected \"via 'Player Ballot' choices and selections made by the Commissioner’s Office\"—were announced on July 10. The final roster size of each team was planned to be 32 players.\nAll-Star legacy selections.\nMLB announced on July 8 that Albert Pujols and Miguel Cabrera had been added as the 33rd player for the NL and AL, respectively, in celebration of their career achievements. This was the 11th All-Star selection for Pujols and the 12th for Cabrera.\nLogo and uniforms.\nThe 2022 All-Star Game logo was shaped after the hexagonal DodgerVision video boards at Dodger Stadium, with gold-trimmed Art Deco lettering as a nod to Hollywood. This was originally unveiled as the logo for the canceled 2020 All-Star Game, but was ultimately recycled for the 2022 game. Uniforms for the American League were in dark gray, while uniforms for the National League were in white. Team logos and letters were in gold with black trim. Caps were black featuring each team's logo in gold and black embellishments, along with a gold star.\nRosters.\nNational League.\n Denotes top vote-getter in each league&lt;br&gt;\n Denotes player was an All-Star legacy selection.\nNational anthems.\nThe Canadian national anthem was sung in English and French by actress and singer Melissa O'Neil, accompanied by organist Dieter Ruehle. The American national anthem was sung by singer-songwriter, actor, and Los Angeles native Ben Platt."

Some conferences, however, were shifted from their traditional region to ensure an even distribution of teams across all eight regions. Each region consisted of two automatic qualifiers (the teams who won their respective conference tournaments) and at-large bids."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Sycamores represent Indiana State University in the NCAA's Missouri Valley Conference.\nIndiana State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1895. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Indiana State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."
