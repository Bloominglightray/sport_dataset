Although the nation is known as Taiwan or the Republic of China, the International Olympic Committee mandates that the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee flag and name is used, and not the flag of Taiwan, as per the Nagoya Resolution, which Chinese Taipei accepted in 1981. This was Chinese Taipei's eighth time participating in the Winter Olympic Games. The Chinese Taipei delegation consisted of a single athlete, luger Ma Chih-hung. He finished 34th in the men's singles event.\nBackground.\nFollowing the Chinese Civil War, the Republic of China retained control of only the island of Taiwan and a few other minor islands. After international recognition shifted to the People's Republic of China in the 1970s and under the People's Republic's One China policy, the only way the Republic of China could participate in international organizations was under a name acceptable to the People's Republic. The Republic of China boycotted the Olympics, at the 1976 Summer Olympics and both Games in 1980 after not being allowed to compete under the name \"Republic of China\". Chinese Taipei accepted the Nagoya Resolution in 1981 and first officially participated in the Olympics at the 1984 Winter Olympics. Chinese Taipei has sent delegations to every Winter Olympic Games since, making Vancouver their eighth appearance at a Winter Olympics under that name.

After the first day, he sat in 33rd place out of 38 competitors. On the second day, he put up times of 51.090 seconds and 50.494 seconds. His total time was therefore 3 minutes and 22.362 seconds, which dropped Ma into 34th overall."

He has previously played in MLB for the Minnesota Twins, Boston Red Sox and Texas Rangers. Pérez was an MLB All-Star in 2022.\nProfessional career.\nTexas Rangers.\nThe Texas Rangers signed Pérez in 2007 for $580,000 as an undrafted free agent. While only making 15 short starts in 62 innings at Rookie-level Spokane, Pérez went 1–2 with a 3.65 earned run average (ERA). \"Baseball America\" ranked Pérez as the #17 baseball prospect in their top 100 for 2010.\nOn June 26, 2012, Pérez was called up by the Rangers. The next day he made his first major league appearance against the Detroit Tigers. He gave up 2 hits and 4 runs while striking out one over two-thirds of an inning. On June 30, Pérez made his first major league start, pitching 5 and a third innings and striking out five while only giving up two runs in a 7–2 win over the Oakland Athletics. On August 1, Pérez was optioned to Triple-A Round Rock to make room for pitcher Ryan Dempster.\nPérez went into 2013 spring training competing for the fifth spot in the Rangers rotation (which eventually went to Nick Tepesch), but on March 3 in a start against the Mariners, he broke his pitching forearm when it was hit by a line drive by Brad Miller. After making 4 rehab starts (2 with Frisco, 2 with Round Rock), Pérez was recalled to make a start on May 27 in a doubleheader against the Diamondbacks. In his season debut, he went 5.1 innings, giving up 4 runs (3 earned) on 9 hits with 2 strikeouts. After the game, he was optioned to Round Rock.

The 2020 option was worth $9 million and has a $750,000 buyout.\nOn April 23, 2014, Pérez threw nine shutout innings against the Oakland A's to secure his second consecutive complete game shutout. After several ineffective starts following the shutouts, Pérez was placed on the disabled list due to inflammation in his pitching elbow. On May 19, 2014, Pérez underwent Tommy John surgery to repair a partially torn UCL in the aforementioned elbow, which kept him out of action for the remainder of 2014. Pérez began the 2015 season on the 60-day disabled list to continue recovery from Tommy John surgery.\nPérez had his first major league hit on July 15, 2016, against Chicago Cubs' pitcher Kyle Hendricks. He hit a single to Kris Bryant. He had been hitless his first nine at bats. In 2016 he was 10–11 and had the fewest strikeouts per 9 innings in the major leagues (4.67).

He also had the highest line drive percentage allowed (24.8%) of all major league pitchers.\nOn April 30, 2018, Pérez was placed on the disabled list with discomfort in his right elbow.

On November 1, the Red Sox declined to exercise their $6.85 million option for Pérez for the 2021 season, paying him a $500,000 buyout and making him a free agent.\nOn February 12, 2021, Pérez officially re-signed with the Red Sox on a one-year, $4.5 million contract. On February 17, MLB.com mistakenly announced that Perez would be switching his uniform number to 33, which had not been issued by the Red Sox since Jason Varitek's retirement in 2012; Pérez clarified that this was an error and that he had no intention of changing numbers. He began the season in the Red Sox rotation, then was moved to the bullpen in early August. On August 30, Pérez was placed on the COVID-related injured list; he returned to the team on September 14. Overall during the regular season, Pérez made 36 appearances (22 starts) for Boston, compiling a 7–8 record with 4.74 ERA; he struck out 97 batters in 114 innings. In the postseason, he made four relief appearances against Houston in the American League Championship Series, allowing five runs in three innings. On November 7, the team declined to exercise their $6 million option on Pérez for 2022, making him a free agent again.\nTexas Rangers (second stint).\nOn March 14, 2022, Pérez signed a one-year, $4 million contract with the Texas Rangers. On May 29, Pérez took perfect game bid versus the Houston Astros into the seventh inning until Chas McCormick led off with a double. Pérez was selected as an American League All-Star in 2022. Over 32 starts in 2022, he posted a 12–8 record with a 2.89 ERA and 169 strikeouts over innings. On November 15, 2022, Pérez accepted a one-year qualifying offer worth $19.65 million to return to Texas for the 2023 season.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nOn January 5, 2024, the Pittsburgh Pirates signed Pérez to a one-year contract worth $8 million.\nPitching style.\nPérez features a four-seam fastball that is regularly clocked at , a sharp breaking curveball, and a change-up. His velocity is not that of a power pitcher, but his pitches have good movement. In 2007, when he was first signed by the Rangers, he was likened to be a cross between Johan Santana and Greg Maddux."

        "text": "The 2009-10 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team represented Villanova University in the 2009–10 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. Villanova was led by head coach Jay Wright. The Wildcats participated in the Big East Conference and played their home games at The Pavilion with some select home games at the Wachovia Center. They finished the season 25–8, 13–5 in Big East play. They were eliminated in the quarterfinals of the 2010 Big East men's basketball tournament by Marquette. They received an at-large bid to the 2010 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, earning a 2 seed in the South Region, where they were upset by 10 seed Saint Mary's in the second round.\nPreseason.\nThe Villanova Wildcats come back from a 2008–09 season which had a record of 30-8 (13-5) with the season ending in the school's 4th appearance in the Final Four.\nSeason overview.\nNovember 19–22, 2009 Puerto Rico Tip-Off.\nNovember 19, 2009 vs. George Mason (2-1).\nIsaiah Armwood hit the game-winning 3-pointer with 13.3 seconds left as the Wildcats survived to advance in Puerto Rico.

He has made 24 free throws in his last two games. Villanova has won nine of their last 11 games against ranked teams.\nNovember 22, 2009 vs. Mississippi (4-1).\nVillanova used an 8–0 run in the opening minutes Sunday night and led 27–23 at halftime, holding the Rebels (4-1) to only 29.6 percent shooting from the field.

It's his third double-double in five games; he had just one in 72 career games prior to this season. Scottie Reynolds scored 18 of his season-high 21 points after halftime.\nOle Miss earned its first-ever NCAA tournament win by defeating Villanova 72–70 in 1999—the only previous meeting between the schools.

Corey Stokes led the way, going 5 for 11 from 3-point range as part of an 18-point performance. Villanova took 41 shots compared to only 25 for Maryland, thanks heavily to a 22-15 rebounding advantage that included 12 on the offensive end.\nDecember 9, 2009 vs. Saint Joseph's (3-5).\n\"at The Palestra, Philadelphia, PA\"\nThe Holy War is a rivalry game in the Philadelphia Big 5 between Saint Joseph's University and Villanova University, which is considered the most intense of all the Big 5 games. Recent games between the two schools have been played in February during ESPN's Rivalry Week, either at the Palestra on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania when Saint Joseph's hosts the game, or at The Pavilion when Villanova is the host.\nNova is 9-0 for the first time since 2005-06 (started 8-0 last season). The 38 points were the most given up by the Wildcats in an opening half this season. Villanova converted 30 of 31 second-half free throw attempts, including 29 in a row, to win for the 43rd time in 57 meetings against the Hawks (3-5). The Wildcats have 21 of its last 22 Big 5 games dating back to the 2004–05 season.\nScottie Reynolds led the team with 22 points. He's averaged 19.7 points, 6.3 rebounds and 6 assists over his last three games.

Corey Fisher donated 16 points and Reggie Redding scored 12. Redding and Fisher added seven and six assists, respectively, in the blowout.\nVillanova did welcome back center Mouphtaou Yarou for the first time since Nov. 16 after he was out due to medical reasons. Yarou started the first two games but was sidelined before a November tournament in Puerto Rico. Yarou scored four points. Nine players had already scored for Villanova only 5 minutes into the second half.\nThe Wildcats ended up hitting 61.3 percent from the field in the first half en route to a comfortable 49-24 cushion, and the Blue Demons never seriously threatened in the final 20 minutes.\nJanuary 9, 2010 vs. Marquette (10-6).\n\"at The Pavilion, Villanova, PA\"\nVillanova led by as many as 22 points, but nearly lost as Marquette cut the lead to two points with 27 seconds left. Corey Stokes led five Wildcat players in double figures with 16 points.\nScottie Reynolds scored 15 points and dished out four assists for the Wildcats (14-1, 3-0 Big East), who have won five straight since losing to Temple on December 13.

Villanova trailed by as many as 17 points in the first half but rallied to improve to 7–1 on the road this season. Louisville had a \"White Out\" in effect at Freedom Hall, which means Louisville coach Rick Pitino did his best to dress like a young Col. Sanders. Nova had lost the previous three matchups.\nThere were 29 turnovers, 31 fouls and 34 free throws in the opening 20 minutes, which took more than an hour to complete. Scottie Reynolds scored 16 of his season-high 36 points over the final 6:05. It was his fifth career 30-point game and all have come on the road. King and Corey Fisher finished with 12 points each, while Wayns added 11.\nAfter the game, Reynolds was reported saying, \"It was basically two separate games. Same thing with Marquette. If I knew [why], it would never happen to us. Against a team like that, you have to make basketball plays. You have to play with your instincts. It's like they had seven guys out there. In practice, we had six.\"\nJanuary 17, 2010 vs. #11 Georgetown (13-3).\n\"at Wachovia Center, Philadelphia, PA\"\nVillanova held off Georgetown's comeback attempt and improved to 16-1 overall and 5–0 in the Big East. They are currently tied for 1st in the Big East with the Pitt Panthers. It's the Wildcats' best conference start since 2002–03, when they also started 5–0.\nThe game bogged down for a long part of the second half as the teams combined to miss 20 straight shots from the field over a 6:12 span. Scottie Reynolds scored 27 points, topping 20 points for the eighth time in his last 10 games. Redding and Wayns both had 11 points for Villanova. The Wildcats hadn't beaten Georgetown since a 56–52 triumph on January 8, 2007. The teams will also meet February 6 in Washington, DC."

        "title": "American snooker",
        "text": "American snooker is a cue sport played almost exclusively in the United States, and strictly on a recreational, amateur basis. Diverging from the original game of snooker, rules for American snooker date back to at least 1925, and have been promulgated by the Billiard Congress of America (BCA) since the mid-20th century. The game is in decline, as the standardized international rules have largely supplanted it.\nAmerican snooker has a simplified rule set compared to the international game, and is usually played on smaller tables. Depending upon equipment availability, the balls and may be larger than those for standard snooker, up to the size of pool balls and pockets.\nThe United States Snooker Association is not connected with the game of American snooker, being the IBSF-recognized US governing body of standard-rules snooker.\nHistory.\nAmerican snooker made its first known in-print appearance in the 1925 edition of Brunswick–Balke–Collender Co.'s \"Rules Governing the Royal Game of Billiards\", a rulebook given away by the company (with illustrations of their tables) as a promotional item. The previous edition, published in 1914, included snooker, but it was a summary of the original British version, as defined then by the Billiard Association of Great Britain and Ireland, whom the Brunswick booklet credited. The 1925 American version had a longer ruleset, opposite the situation today. Since at least as early as 1946, the Billiard Association of America (BAA), later the Billiard Congress of America (BCA), has published rules for American snooker in every edition of its near-annual rule book. The BCA describes the game as \"a cousin of snooker as it is played broadly around the world, the regulations giving it a distinctive direction toward the configuration of many American pocket billiard games\". Various rules are more in tune with pool-player expectations, such as no requirement to shoot away from an that is to the .\nNo organized championship has been held in decades, and the game is principally of historical interest. The rules are sometimes used with American snooker balls on American pool tables as a loose approximation of snooker.\nEquipment.\nAmerican snooker often uses 54 mm ( inch) balls, but may use standard 52.5 mm (approx.  in) balls. It is typically played on a table (and in private homes, often on even smaller tables), as full-size regulation British-style tables are rare in the United States, although they are legal for American snooker. Most serious players obtain proper snooker cues, though novices may settle for a thicker-tipped pool cue. The game can easily be adapted informally to standard, large-pocketed pool tables, with snooker ball sets the same size as regular American pool balls (to compensate for the larger pool ); Saluc, for example, manufactures such a 57 mm ( inch) set, under their Aramith brand name. American snooker sets often come with that are numbered with their values.\nRules.\nWhile American snooker shares many similarities to that of the modern international game of snooker, it has some differences. Foul shots are always awarded as a 7-point foul, as opposed to 4–7 depending on circumstances in the traditional game. Fouling can also occur if the cue makes contact with the table cloth, causing a 14-point foul. Colored balls must be pocketed cleanly, meaning that once the cue ball has struck them, they cannot make contact with any other ball before being pocketed, or it is a foul.\nAs is more traditional with pool games, a is used in place of a coin flip at the beginning of the match, and also in the case of a black."

        "title": "Javy Guerra (baseball, born 1985)",
        "text": "Luis Javier Guerra (born October 31, 1985) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. Guerra was drafted in the 4th round of the 2004 MLB Draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers. He made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut with the Dodgers in 2011. He also played in MLB for the Chicago White Sox, Los Angeles Angels, Miami Marlins, Toronto Blue Jays, and Washington Nationals. He won the 2019 World Series with the Nationals.\nProfessional career.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nGuerra was drafted in the 4th round of the 2004 MLB Draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers out of Billy Ryan High School in Denton, Texas. He is of Mexican descent.\nIn the Dodgers system he pitched for the Columbus Catfish in 2005, Ogden Raptors in 2006, Inland Empire 66ers of San Bernardino from 2007–2008 and split 2009 between the Great Lakes Loons and the Chattanooga Lookouts. He was selected to the Midwest League Mid-season All-Star team in 2009 and participated in the Arizona Fall League Rising Stars game. In 2010 with Chattanooga he had a 2.33 ERA in 28 games, despite missing a portion of the season due to injury. Following the season, he played for the Phoenix Desert Dogs in the Arizona Fall League. He returned to Chattanooga to start 2011.\nGuerra was called up to the Dodgers on May 15, 2011 and made his debut in the ninth inning against the Arizona Diamondbacks, working a scoreless inning. On May 24 he was credited with his first career save by pitching a scoreless ninth inning against the Houston Astros. On June 4 he earned his first win by pitching the tenth inning and part of the eleventh, allowing one run in an 11-8 victory against the Cincinnati Reds; he also batted for himself and drew a base on balls. With Jonathan Broxton out for the year with injuries, Guerra became the Dodgers closer for most of the season. He finished with a 2-2 record, 2.31 ERA and 21 saves.\nGuerra began 2012 as the Dodgers closer and picked up saves in his first five chances and seven of his first eight, but then he went through a period where he blew two of his next three opportunities and also pitched poorly in some non-save appearances. As a result, he was dropped from the closer role in favor of Kenley Jansen. He was later demoted to the Triple–A Albuquerque Isotopes in August. Guerra rejoined the Dodgers when rosters expanded in September, but suffered a strained oblique and was placed on the disabled list for the remainder of the season. Overall, he appeared in 45 games for the Dodgers in 2012, with a 2-3 record, 2.60 ERA and 8 saves.\nOn November 2, Guerra underwent arthroscopic right shoulder surgery, his third different surgery in 2012. He returned in time for spring training, but his injury kept him from participating in the 2013 World Baseball Classic. He also suffered a groin strain during spring training and the setback led to him falling behind the other relievers and he was optioned to Albuquerque to start the season. He spent the bulk of the season there, appearing in 27 games (including 4 as a starter) and was 0-4 with a 3.66 ERA and 12 saves. He also appeared in 9 games with the Dodgers in May and had an ERA of 6.75.\nGuerra was designated for assignment by the Dodgers on March 16, 2014 and removed from the 40-man roster.\nChicago White Sox.\nThe Chicago White Sox claimed him off waivers on March 26, 2014. On March 28, the White Sox outrighted him to the Triple–A Charlotte Knights. He was called up to the majors in May. Guerra was designated for assignment by the White Sox on May 6, 2015. On July 8, Guerra was suspended 50 games for drug abuse.\nLos Angeles Angels.\nOn February 10, 2016, Guerra signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Angels. He was designated for assignment on May 13. He was called back up by the Angels on June 1 and designated for assignment on June 7.\nMiami Marlins.\nOn December 17, 2016, Guerra signed a minor league contract with the Miami Marlins. He was outrighted to the Triple–A New Orleans Baby Cakes on October 7, 2017.\nHe re–signed with Miami on a minor league deal on January 13, 2018. Guerra had his contract selected on July 9. In 2018 with Miami he was 1-1 with one save and a 5.55 ERA in 32 relief appearances. He declared free agency on October 12.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nOn January 10, 2019, Guerra signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. On March 28, Guerra was added to the 25-man roster for Opening Day. He was designated for assignment on April 18 to make room for Ryan Tepera who was activated from the 10 day injured list. His contract was selected on May 10, and he was called up to the major league roster. He was designated for assignment again on May 18. With the Blue Jays in 2019 he was 0-0 with one save and a 3.86 ERA in 11 relief appearances.\nWashington Nationals.\nGuerra was claimed off outright waivers by the Washington Nationals on May 20, 2019. He was designated for assignment on July 31. He had his contract selected for a second time on August 4. In 2019 with the Nationals he was 3-1 with one save and a 4.86 ERA in 40 relief appearances. Guerra pitched the ninth inning of Game 2 of the World Series, allowing a solo home run to Martín Maldonado in a 12-3 Nationals win over the Houston Astros. He was non-tendered by the Nationals on December 2, making him a free agent. To remain in the Nationals organization, Guerra subsequently signed a minor league deal with an invitation to major league spring training. On July 23, 2020, Guerra's contract was selected to the 40-man roster. On October 12, Guerra was outrighted off the roster and subsequently elected free agency. On December 21, Guerra re-signed with the Nationals organization on a minor league contract.\nOn August 3, 2021, Guerra's contract was selected by the Nationals, but he was again designated for assignment on August 22. In 6 games for the Nationals, Guerra struggled to a 16.50 ERA with 4 strikeouts. On August 22, Guerra was designated for assignment by the Nationals.\nOn August 24, Guerra cleared waivers, but rejected his outright assignment and elected free agency.\nToros de Tijuana.\nOn April 9, 2022, Guerra signed with the Toros de Tijuana of the Mexican League. He pitched in 31 games for Tijuana, posting a 2-2 record and 3.21 ERA with 31 strikeouts in 28.0 innings pitched. \nGuerra made 43 relief appearances for Tijuana the following year, registering a 2–4 record and 5.77 ERA with 25 strikeouts across innings pitched. He retired from professional baseball following the 2023 season.\nPitching style.\nGuerra mostly throws a hard four-seam fastball (93–96 mph) and cutter (88–91), although he occasionally mixes in a curveball (78–80). He has even sprinkled in a small handful of sliders, changeups, and splitters — all in the mid-80s range.\nPersonal life.\nGuerra was born in Denton, Texas. His mother and father were both born in Mexico, his mother lives in Denton, Texas and his father makes his home in Múzquiz, Coahuila. Guerra lives in Phoenix during the offseason."

        "title": "1938–39 Oregon Webfoots men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1938–39 Oregon Webfoots men's basketball team was a college basketball team that represented the University of Oregon. The Webfoots, coached by Howard Hobson, played in the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) and compiled a 29–5 win–loss record in regular and postseason competition. After winning the PCC title, they became the champions of the inaugural NCAA basketball tournament.\nComing off a season in which the Webfoots were defeated in the PCC championship series by Stanford, the team returned all five of their starters. Known for their fast break offense, Oregon's players were nicknamed the \"Tall Firs\" and held a height advantage over most teams. After several early-season wins, the Webfoots went on an extended road trip to the East Coast, becoming the first West Coast team to do so. The team suffered two losses on the trip, to City College of New York (CCNY) and Bradley, but posted seven victories as well. Oregon won 10 consecutive games at one point in PCC competition, and clinched a Northern Division championship with a win in the next-to-last contest of the regular season. In the best-of-three PCC championship series, against California, the Webfoots won in two games to earn the team's first conference championship since 1919.\nOregon was invited to compete in the West Regional of the NCAA tournament, and beat Texas in their first game to reach the regional final, where the team won against Oklahoma. At the first NCAA tournament final, versus Ohio State, the Webfoots claimed a 46–33 victory behind a game-high 15 points by John H. Dick. Three players from the 1938–39 Oregon men's basketball team were selected as All-Americans, and Hobson and Lauren Gale have been honored by the Basketball Hall of Fame.\nBackground.\nThe 1937–38 Webfoots posted a win–loss record of 14–6 in Pacific Coast Conference play. In the conference's North division, the Webfoots won the title by a one-game margin over Washington. The Webfoots were led by Lauren Gale, who was the PCC North division's leader in scoring with 12.5 points per game in conference play; his overall average was 12.4. Oregon advanced to the best-of-three PCC championship series, but lost two consecutive games to Stanford by margins of 52–39 and 59–51. That ended the team's hopes of being crowned PCC champions. Following the decisive game of the series, player Bobby Anet said at a team meeting, \"Next year, we're going to win everything.\"\nRoster and schedule.\nOregon's entire starting lineup returned from the 1937–38 team that had lost in the conference championship playoff; it included 6'8\" center Slim Wintermute, who was known for his shot-blocking ability. Forward Gale, who was 6'4\", had what sportswriter Michael Russell called \"enormous hands (that) allowed him to fake opponents while palming the ball with one hand\"; he was the PCC points-scoring leader in 1938–39. Anet, a 5'8\" guard, was \"the heart of the team\", according to Russell, due to his ability to dribble and run the floor quickly. He was the Webfoots' captain, and was responsible for calling timeouts and engaging in conversations with referees. Other players on the team included 6'4\" forward John H. Dick and 5'11\" guard Wally Johansen. Newspaper editor L. H. Gregory called the Oregon team the \"Tall Firs\" due to the height of the team's players, since Oregon was taller than most other teams of the era. Eight of the eleven men on the roster came from Oregon, and the other three from neighboring Washington. Anet and Johansen, along with forwards Earl Sandness and Ted Sarpola, had played for Astoria High School; Anet and Johansen had won multiple state championships before joining Oregon. Ford Mullen, a future Major League Baseball player, was a backup guard on the team. Along with Mullen, the Webfoots' reserves included guard Matt Pavalunas and forwards Bob Hardy and Ted Sarpola. The team normally played up to nine players in a game, foregoing a regular substitute for Wintermute; when he needed a rest, Dick or Gale often changed positions to play center, allowing for a third forward to be inserted into the lineup. The Webfoots' head coach was Howard Hobson, who was in his fourth season on the job. In his previous three seasons, he had led the Webfoots to a total win–loss record of 63–28.\nOregon's preferred offensive game plan was to play an attacking fast break style of basketball. In response, opposing teams with shorter players often played a slower-paced offense. Oregon's fast break was unique among West Coast basketball teams, who were not accustomed to facing such an offensive style. Dick said of the team's attack that \"We wanted to keep the pressure on (the opponent) mentally – more so than physically. Never give them a moment's rest.\" When inbounding the ball, the Webfoots often restarted play quickly to maintain their fast pace. Hobson frequently tracked Oregon's attempted shots in both competition and practice sessions, and built the offense around his players' strengths. On defense, the team switched between zone and man-to-man styles depending on how its opponent played.\n!colspan=12| Regular season\n!colspan=12| PCC championship\n!colspan=12| NCAA tournament\nRegular season.\nThe Webfoots began the 1938–39 season by defeating Portland 51–24 on November 29, 1938. Oregon's second game was also against a team based in Portland, which represented the Multnomah Athletic Club. The Webfoots won by an 83–25 final score. In a closer game with a team representing Signal Oil, Oregon stretched its winning streak to three games with a 46–34 triumph. The team then recorded a victory over Pacific Packards, by a 54–39 final score.\nFollowing those games, the Webfoots embarked on a long trip through the Eastern United States; they were the first college basketball team from the West Coast to do so. Nine games were set up in as many cities, with eight held on the East Coast and one in San Francisco before the team returned home. In scheduling the extended trip away from Oregon, Hobson sought to show the team \"different styles of play and officiating\" and help them prepare for games later in the season. As a result of the extended travel, a University of Oregon student newspaper nickname the club the \"Wandering Webfoots\". The first game of the trip came in December at New York City's Madison Square Garden against City College of New York (CCNY). Oregon had a poor start to the game; according to the \"Sporting News\", the team was \"confused by officials' interpretation of legal and illegal screens to the moving picks set by City College of New York.\" CCNY took an early 10-point lead, but Oregon cut its deficit in half by the end of the first half, and tied the game at 30–30. Despite Oregon's comeback attempt, CCNY won 38–36 to hand the Webfoots their first loss of the season. The trip continued on December 19 with a game at Convention Hall in Philadelphia, against local team Saint Joseph's. Oregon won easily by a 54–44 margin, as Gale and Wintermute led the Webfoots with 13 points each.\nFuture stops included Chicago, Cleveland, and Detroit, among other locations. Starting with the St. Joseph's game, the Webfoots had a streak in which they played four games in five days before Christmas Eve. On December 20, Oregon routed Miami (Ohio) 74–38, as Sarpola led the team with 20 points. Wintermute suffered an ankle injury during the game. The Webfoots then defeated Canisius by a 12-point margin. In the next game, against an undefeated Wayne State team, the Webfoots entered halftime tied at 22–22 and needed a late burst of scoring, led by Gale and Johansen, to clinch an 11-point victory. After the Miami (Ohio) game, Wintermute missed three of the team's following four games. The Webfoots won without him in their next two games, but not in the game in which he returned to action against Bradley. In Peoria, Illinois, Oregon fell behind by 17 points at halftime and lost 52–39, as Bradley center Dar Hutchins tallied 17 points while defended by Wintermute, who was playing through his ankle injury. Following their loss to Bradley, Oregon traveled to the Chicago Coliseum for a game against Western Illinois State Teachers College. Despite being without the services of Wintermute again, the Webfoots posted a 60–45 victory. Drake, the Webfoots' opponent on December 29 in Chicago, was defeated by 11 points. The final game of the road trip, held in San Francisco on New Year's Eve, saw the Webfoots lose to Stanford. The stretch proved profitable for the school, which made $4,400 off of the East Coast games, and Dick credited the trip for giving the Webfoots exposure to different styles of play than they had been accustomed to.\nConference play.\nThe Webfoots then entered play in the PCC, with four games scheduled against each of the four other teams in the conference's Northern Division; Oregon hosted each club twice and played two games at all opposing teams' arenas. At the beginning of 1939, the Webfoots began its PCC schedule with consecutive home games against Washington State on January 6 and 7. In the first, Oregon entered halftime with a nine-point advantage and prevailed by a 46–35 margin. They lost the second, 39–34, for their only home defeat of the season; the loss broke a 23-game winning streak at McArthur Court, the Webfoots' arena.\nOregon then began a 10-game winning streak, their longest since the start of the 1937–38 season. Oregon State was the Webfoots' first opponent during the streak, on January 13; Oregon prevailed 31–26. In two higher-scoring contests at Washington State on January 17 and 18, the Webfoots claimed 56–44 and 57–31 victories, respectively. A five-game road trip concluded with games in Idaho on January 20 and 21. The contests were closer than those against Washington State, but the Webfoots won 38–30 in the first game and 35–31 in the second to improve to 6–1 in conference play. Oregon's next five games were at home, beginning with a second encounter against Oregon State, on January 27 that they won by a seven-point margin. Washington traveled to Oregon for games on January 31 and February 1, and 57–49 and 58–42 victories moved the Webfoots' winning streak to eight. They then concluded their four-game season series with Idaho, winning by 17 points in each game. On February 18, the Webfoots' streak ended with a 50–31 upset loss to Oregon State, which would be their last of the season. Six days later, Oregon posted a 48–37 win over the Beavers at home. That game was the Webfoots' last appearance for the 1938–39 regular season at McArthur Court; it was the school's 100th win at the arena since it was opened in 1927.\nWith two games left in the regular season, the Webfoots held a one-game lead over Washington, with a pair of contests scheduled in Seattle against the Huskies. Oregon required one victory to clinch the Northern Division championship. On March 3, the Webfoots defeated Washington in the first game of the series 39–26; Gale led the team in scoring with 11 points, as the team won despite missing 53 of their 67 field goal attempts. Anet suffered a dislocated finger and was held out of the second game against Washington, which took place the following day. The Webfoots claimed a two-point win, their fourth of the season over Washington. Of the Huskies' five losses in 1938–39, all but one was against the Webfoots. By the end of the regular season, Oregon had won the PCC North Division with a 14–2 conference record, and had a 24–5 record overall.\nPostseason.\nPCC championship series.\nBy winning the PCC Northern Division, Oregon earned the right to play the winner of the Southern Division in a best-of-three playoff series, with the games held at McArthur Court. In addition to the PCC championship, the winner would gain a berth in the first NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, which the National Association of Basketball Coaches would run. The series was slated to be held between March 10–13, but a tie between California and Southern California for first place in the Southern Division necessitated a one-game playoff. Rumors began that the PCC championship series would be postponed by one week, which would have prevented the winner from competing in the NCAA tournament; the event was scheduled to begin on March 20. In response, Oregon declared that they would not play if the series was scheduled to end after March 14. Despite the school's claim, it agreed to a rescheduling approved by PCC member schools, in which the series was set for March 16–18. Hobson declared that Oregon would accept an invitation to the NCAA tournament, following hints that the PCC champion might be passed over for a bid in favor of a PCC team that did not receive a shortened rest between games. California won the Southern Division playoff 42–36 over Southern California to become the Webfoots' opponent in the PCC championship series. Dick later noted that he considered it vital for Oregon to sweep the Golden Bears in two games, to avoid an overnight trip to San Francisco for the NCAA tournament and secure an off day in the Webfoots' schedule.\nIn front of a crowd that included members of the Webfoots' 1919 conference championship team, which had won the title over California, Oregon took a one-point halftime lead on a late 30-foot shot by Johansen. The team switched its defense from zone to man-to-man for the second half and went on an early second half run to open up a 14-point lead with 12 minutes left. The Golden Bears made multiple comeback bids as the half progressed, but the Webfoots held on to win 54–49 and move ahead in the series. More than half of Oregon's points were scored by Gale and Wintermute, who had 18 and 11 respectively. The second game of the series was closely contested in the first half, but Oregon opened a 25–23 lead at halftime and extended their advantage to eight points before a run of three baskets by California. A stretch featuring three scores by Dick helped the Webfoots rebuild their lead later in the second half, and they clinched a two-game sweep with a 53–47 victory. Dick and Wintermute contributed 16 points apiece. It was Oregon's first PCC championship in 20 seasons.\nNCAA tournament.\nOregon received an invitation to the NCAA tournament's West Regional, which was held on March 20 and 21 in San Francisco. First, Oregon faced Texas in the first round, in a matchup of teams considered superior to either of their potential opponents in the regional final, according to analysts. The Webfoots scored 10 of the game's first 12 points, led by Dick and Wintermute, and held a three-point halftime advantage. After Texas had closed their deficit to one point multiple times in the second half, Oregon went on a scoring run and eventually opened a 19-point lead. The Webfoots defeated Texas by a final score of 56–41. Wintermute had 14 points in the game, and Dick added 13. In the regional final against Oklahoma, a 10–0 run to close the first half put the Webfoots in front, 21–14. Oregon took advantage of Oklahoma's strategy of attempting to play a fast-paced game and extended their lead in the second half. Dick had 14 points and Gale and Wintermute scored 11 and 10, respectively, as Oregon advanced to the national championship game with a 55–37 victory. All three of the Webfoots' leading scorers in the regional final were selected to the all-Western regional squad, as determined by Kansas head coach Phog Allen. Hobson commented on his team's NCAA tournament opponents that \"We were head and shoulders above [both], but not so with Washington and California.\"\nThe title game was held on March 27 in Northwestern University's Patten Gymnasium. Oregon's opponent was Ohio State, who had won the East Regional by winning against Wake Forest and Villanova. Oregon took advantage of the Buckeyes' defense, which was designed to stop Gale and Wintermute, by using Gale as \"a decoy\", in his words. This created an opportunity for contributions from the Webfoots' other players, including Dick, who led both teams by scoring 15 points. On Ohio State's offensive possessions, the Webfoots used a match-up zone defense, as Hobson sought to force the Buckeyes into attempting long-distance shots. The defense held the Buckeyes' field goal percentage to 17 percent for the game; in addition, Oregon gained a rebounding advantage. The Webfoots held a five-point lead at halftime, having led by as much as seven. After Ohio State closed to within one point, Oregon pulled away in the second half to win the national championship, 46–33. Afterward came what Dick termed \"a two-handed trophy presentation\"; during the game, Anet had broken a figure off the top of the championship trophy while attempting to gain possession of the ball by the sideline. On the team's way back to the University of Oregon, a crowd of 2,000–3,000 people greeted the Webfoots in The Dalles, Dick's birthplace, and presented him with what \"Sporting News\" writer Joe Gergen called \"the first championship watch in NCAA Tournament history.\" The train stopped in several other cities on the way to Eugene, where a parade was held for the Webfoots.\nAftermath and legacy.\nAt the end of the season, Anet, Gale, and Wintermute were selected as All-Americans. In the 1939–40 season, the Webfoots were unable to defend their PCC championship, finishing second behind Oregon State in the division; the following season, all but one of the players from the championship team had graduated, and the Webfoots ended tied for third. The team did not win the Northern Division again until 1944–45. Hobson left the program before the 1947–48 season to become Yale's men's basketball head coach. Gale and Wintermute later played professional basketball in the National Basketball League; both were members of the same team, the Detroit Eagles, and Anet declined an offer to join them. Dick briefly played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball before embarking on a military career of over 30 years after the U.S. entered World War II. Anet and Johansen joined a Eugene, Oregon-based AAU team, the Rubenstein's Oregonians, and helped the club win a state title and reach the quarterfinals of the AAU's national basketball tournament in 1940. Bob Hardy and Mullen both played minor league baseball, and Mullen reached the major leagues with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1944.\nHobson was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1965, and Gale followed him into the Hall 12 years later. The entire 1938–39 Oregon team was enshrined in the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1984, and Anet, Dick, Gale, Hobson, Johansen, and Wintermute were inducted as individuals. The University of Oregon Athletic Hall of Fame selected the team and Hobson as part of its inaugural class of inductees in 1992. Dick and Gale (1993), Wintermute (1994), and Anet and Johansen (1996) were also inducted in later years. All five of the team's starters have had their numbers retired by the university. Oregon's appearance in the semifinals of the NCAA tournament was the only one in program history until the 2016–17 season."

        "title": "Baseball in Nicaragua",
        "text": "Baseball is the national game of Nicaragua, and is one of the most popular sports in the country. Nicaragua has a professional baseball league, the Nicaraguan Professional Baseball League, consisting of four teams, playing in the winter, and a semiprofessional league, El Campeonato German Pomares, playing in spring and summer. The national baseball team has been successful in the past, mainly throughout the 1970s. Nicaragua and near-by Panama are two countries who have baseball as their national sport, rather than soccer, the national sport of many Central American countries.\nHistory timeline.\nEarly history.\nBaseball was introduced in the 1880s by Albert Addlesberg, an American businessman living in Bluefields. During this time, the area around Bluefields was known as the autonomous Mosquito Reserve and a strong British influence in the area was evidenced by the popularity of cricket. Addlesberg convinced two of the most popular cricket clubs to switch to baseball and supplied the locals with equipment he imported from New Orleans. Two teams were created in , the Southern and Four Roses. They began to play in and baseball has been played on the Mosquito Coast almost continuously since that time, but the entire region has long since been incorporated into the Republic of Nicaragua. The first 'official' game took place in between Managua and Granada. Carter Donaldson, who was the U.S. Consul in Nicaragua at the time, founded the first continuous team in 1904. United States Marines stationed in Nicaragua in the early part of the 20th century were also credited for bringing the sport to the country, and popularizing it in the area.\n1960s and 1970s.\nNicaragua experimented with professional baseball in the 1950s, when the Nicaraguan Professional Baseball League was first formed. This era was characterized by the fierce rivalry between Cinco Estrellas, considered the club sponsored by the Somoza regime, and Indios del Bóer, which was adopted by opponents of the Somozas.\nProfessional baseball came to an end in Nicaragua in 1967, after years of political and economic problems. In the 1970s, however, baseball again became popular after the success of the Nicaragua national baseball team.\n1980s and 1990s.\nIn the 1980s, popularity of baseball in the country began to decline. After the Nicaraguan civil war, baseball began to flourish again. The policy of Nicaraguan professional baseball before the 1990s was to discourage the recruitment of Nicaraguan players by Major League Baseball scouts. On August 6, 1990, the San Francisco Giants signed two players from Nicaragua, and considered building a baseball academy in a move that was seen as a step to normalizing the relationship between Nicaragua and Major League Baseball. During the 1996 Nicaraguan presidential election, candidates, Arnoldo Alemán, and Daniel Ortega, promised increased funding for the Nicaraguan national baseball team.\nPresent day.\nIn the spring of 2004, professional baseball returned to Nicaragua for the first time since 1967. In a typical modern-day game, teams have sets of cheerleaders, as well as team mascots, and marching bands who play throughout the game. Dennis Martínez National Stadium, located in Managua, Nicaragua, is used by the Indios del Bóer of the Nicaraguan Professional Baseball League.

The 2009 World Baseball Classic was criticized by NBC Sports writer Joe Connor, after the tournament invited national baseball teams from China, Australia, and Italy, over teams from Nicaragua, and Colombia, where the sport is considerably more popular.

        "title": "Bemidji State Beavers men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Bemidji State Beavers men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents Bemidji State University. The Beavers are a member of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association and play at Sanford Center in Bemidji, Minnesota, as of the 2010 season, after previously playing at the John S. Glas Field House.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe Bemidji State men's ice hockey program began in 1946. From the inaugural 1946-47 season through the 1966-67 season BSU played as an independent member of Division I. In 1968 the team became a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). The program continued to operate as an independent member, now in the NAIA from 1968-69 through the 1979-80 season. For the 1980-81 season the program joined the Northern Collegiate Hockey Association (NCHA), in which Bemidji State is a charter member. BSU won the 1981–82 and 1982-83 NCHA regular season championships. Following the 1982-83 season BSU moved to NCAA Division II remaining in the NCHA. During the program's 16-season tenure in the NAIA the team won NAIA national ice hockey championships 9 times, including the first NAIA Championship in 1968.\nThe Beavers won their third straight NCHA regular season championship in 1983-84 and qualified for the NCAA tournament. In the 1984 tournament BSU won its first NCAA title at the Division II level with BSU sweeping Merrimack in a best-of-three series winning 6-3 and 8-1. Beginning in the following season, the Division II tournament was combined with the NCAA Division III level. The Beavers won the NCHA regular season championship for the third straight season and qualified for the school's first NCAA Division III ice hockey championship. BSU came in second after a 1-5 loss in the finals to RIT. Bemidji State won the first ever NCHA playoff tournament at the conclusion of the 1985-86 season and continued momentum into the NCAA DIII tournament winning the Division III Championship in an 8-5 win over Plattsburgh State. BSU made the NCAA Division III tournament three more times in the 1980s, 1987-1989 but finished fourth once and third twice. The Division II Ice Hockey Tournament was reinstated beginning in 1992-93 season and BSU won The Division II championship three straight years 1993-1995. In the 1996 championship the Beavers came up short to Alabama-Huntsville. The following season Alabama-Huntsville would get revenge, beating Bemidji State in the 1998 championship game. That would be the last year BSU participated in the DII tournament, the Beavers failed to qualify for the last NCAA DII Tournament in 1999 and the following season the Beavers moved to NCAA Division I level.\nRecent history.\nCHA era.\nBemidji State joined two other former Division II ice hockey members Alabama–Huntsville and Findlay along with former DI independent teams Air Force, Army, and Niagara and expansion program Wayne State to form College Hockey America at the Division I level after the NCAA ended sponsorship of a Division II ice hockey tournament due to lack of membership. Ted Belisle joined the coaching team as an assistant, and BSU won their first CHA regular season championship in the 2003-04 season but lost 2004 CHA Championship and an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament in overtime 3-4 to (#2) Niagara.\nThe 2004-05 marked a historic season for the BSU hockey program. The team swept through the CHA winning the CHA regular season championship and winning the 2005 CHA Championship over Alabama-Huntsville. The 3-0 shutout win gave the Beavers their first berth in the NCAA Division I Ice Hockey Tournament in program history. the team came close to a major upset, losing 3-4 in overtime to the #1 ranked Denver in the opening round. Bemidji beat Niagara 4-2 to win the 2006 CHA Championship and advance to the 2006 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament for the second year in a row. BSU again lost in the opening round, this time to Wisconsin 0-4.\nThe 2008-09 season was the most successful season the team has had at the Division I level. The Beavers finished the regular season 1st in the CHA with a record of 12-5-1 and won the 2009 CHA Championship in 3-2 in overtime over Robert Morris. The team picked up the first NCAA Division I tournament win in the 2009 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament with a 5-1 upset over Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's ice hockey, a #1 seed and ranked 2nd in the national rankings. The Beavers advanced for the first time in the Division I tournament and beat Cornell 4-1 to advance to the school's first ever Frozen Four held at the Verizon Center in Washington D.C. Bemidji faced Miami (Ohio) in the National Semifinal game with a 1-4 loss to the RedHawks.\nWCHA era.\nIn addition to the on-ice success, in 2008 Bemidji began exploring options to strengthen the program. The CHA had lost many of the original member to programs at Findlay and Wayne State folding and other teams transferring to other college hockey conferences. Travel expenses to remaining members in Huntsville, Alabama, and Western New York and Pennsylvania was also a concern. BSU began looking at the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) as a solution. In a first step the university signed a scheduling agreement against WCHA schools, many within a few hours drive to Bemidji, Minnesota. Other than the WCHA BSU's only option was to end the historic program. In 2009 it was announced the university and city of Bemidji would build a 4,000-5,000 seat state-of-the-art arena to meet WCHA requirements, that the 2,400-seat John S. Glas Field House did not meet. With the news of the Bemidji Regional Events Center BSU applied to join the Western Collegiate Hockey Association in early 2009. Bemidji State along with University of Nebraska-Omaha (transferring from the CCHA) was accepted into the WCHA as the 11th and 12th members. BSU officially became a member on July 1, 2010.\nThe Beavers opened WCHA play in the new Bemidji Regional Events Center on October 15, 2010 against North Dakota in a 2-5 loss. Bemidji picked up their first WCHA win at St. Cloud State 3-2 in overtime. Bemidji ended the regular season with a conference record of 8-15-5 as the 10th seed entering the 2011 WCHA Tournament. In the first round of the WCHA playoffs the Beaver beat 3rd-seeded Nebraska-Omaha two games to none with 4-3 and 4-2 wins. The series sweep sent Bemidji to its first ever WCHA Final Five and upset Minnesota–Duluth 3-2 in overtime, before losing to Denver 2-6 in the semifinal game.\nWith a WCHA Conference record of 20 wins, 6 losses, and 2 ties, The Bemidji State Beavers became WCHA Regular Season Champions at the conclusion of the 2016-2017 season. They compiled 64 conference points, 10 more than runner-up Michigan Tech, and won the school's first coveted MacNaughton Cup.\nCCHA era.\nBemidji State was one of the seven WCHA members that jointly announced in 2019 that they would leave that league after the 2020–21 season. These seven schools announced in early 2020 that they would reestablish the CCHA, and added an eighth member before starting play in the revived league in 2021.\nThe Beavers claimed their first CCHA regular season championship and second MacNaughton Cup at the conclusion of the 2023-2024 season.\nAwards.\nNCAA.\nIndividual awards.\nSenior CLASS Award\nAll-Americans.\nSecond Team\nCHA.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nStudent-Athlete of the Year\nCoach of the Year\nMost Valuable Player in Tournament\nAll-CHA Teams.\nFirst Team\nSecond Team\nRookie Team\nWCHA.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nDefensive Player of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nOutstanding Student-Athlete of the Year\nGoaltending Champion\nCoach of the Year\nAll-WCHA Teams.\nFirst Team\nSecond Team\nThird Team\nRookie Team\nCCHA.\nAll-Conference Teams.\nFirst Team All-CCHA\nSecond Team all-CCHA\nCCHA All-Rookie Team\nStatistical Leaders.\nCareer scoring leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points; PIM = Penalty minutes\"\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of Bemidji State alumni were a part of an Olympic team.\nBeavers in the NHL.\nWHA.\nOne player was a member of the WHA."

        "text": "José Antonio Iglesias Alemán (born January 5, 1990) is a Cuban professional baseball shortstop for the New York Mets of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made his MLB debut in 2011 with the Boston Red Sox, and has also played for the Detroit Tigers, Cincinnati Reds, Baltimore Orioles, Los Angeles Angels and Colorado Rockies. Listed at and , he bats and throws right-handed.\nProfessional career.\nDefection and minors.\nWhile in Cuba, Iglesias played with La Habana of the Cuban National Series. With pitcher Noel Argüelles, Iglesias defected from the Cuban junior national team while in Canada in July 2008. Iglesias signed as an international amateur free agent with the Boston Red Sox in September 2009. Prior to the 2011 season, Iglesias was the sole Red Sox prospect on the MLB.com annual list of top 50 baseball prospects, where he was ranked 42nd.\nBoston Red Sox (2011–2013).\nIn March 2011, Iglesias was optioned to the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox. Iglesias was called up by the Red Sox and made his major league debut on May 8, 2011 as a defensive substitute for Jed Lowrie in the ninth inning of a 9–5 win over the Minnesota Twins. In the next game, he represented the game-winning run, scoring from first base on a Carl Crawford double in the 11th inning. On May 11, 2011, Iglesias made his first MLB start due to Jed Lowrie being sick.\nIglesias started the 2012 season in Pawtucket. He was called up to Boston May 1 after an ailing back sidelined Kevin Youkilis, but he did not appear in a game before being sent back down to Triple-A. Iglesias also appeared late in the 2012 season to back up Mike Avilés, and hit his first career home run during this stretch.\nEntering 2013, Iglesias was ranked as the 10th best prospect in the Red Sox organization, and 96th on the MLB.com Top 100 Prospects list. He started the season in Boston, going 9-for-20 with two doubles and one RBI in six games, but was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket after Stephen Drew was activated on April 10. He was recalled by the Red Sox on May 24 when third baseman Will Middlebrooks was placed on the DL. Iglesias excelled while splitting time between shortstop and third base, remaining in the starting lineup even after Middlebrooks returned from the DL. Despite being known primarily for his defense, Iglesias batted .420 for a stretch of over 100 at-bats after being recalled, including an 18-game hitting streak that was broken on June 19 against the Tampa Bay Rays. For his efforts, he was named the American League Rookie of the Month for June. Iglesias started the 2013 season playing 63 games with a .330 batting average, a home run, and 19 RBIs while with Boston.\nDetroit Tigers (2013–2018).\nOn July 30, Iglesias was traded to the Detroit Tigers in a three-team deal that sent Jake Peavy and Brayan Villarreal to the Boston Red Sox and Avisail García and Francellis Montas to the Chicago White Sox. Iglesias chose jersey No. 1, making him the first Tigers player to wear it since Lou Whitaker retired in 1995. Following the 50-game suspension given to Tigers' starting shortstop Jhonny Peralta on August 5 for his connections to the South Florida Biogenesis clinic, Iglesias was named the Tigers' new everyday shortstop.\nFor the rest of the 2013 season with the Tigers, Iglesias batted .259 with two home runs, and 10 RBIs in 46 games. Overall in 2013, Iglesias hit .303 with 3 home runs and 29 RBIs in 109 games combined with both the Red Sox and Tigers. On the field, he committed 6 errors in 357 chances. Iglesias was part of the Tigers' 25-man active roster for their postseason run. During the postseason, Iglesias batted .231 with one RBI. Iglesias finished second in the American League Rookie of the Year voting in 2013, being edged out by Wil Myers.\nOn January 8, 2014, Iglesias and the Tigers agreed to terms on a one-year contract worth $1.65 million. Although Iglesias was under team control through 2018, his 2014 salary had yet to be determined after the contract he signed with the Red Sox as an amateur free agent expired. Iglesias missed the entire 2014 season due to stress fractures in both of his shins.\nOn July 6, 2015, Iglesias was named as a reserve for the American League at the 2015 All-Star Game. On September 5, it was announced that Iglesias suffered a non-displaced small fracture in his right middle finger at the PIP joint after being hit on the hand by a pitch, and the team announced he would be out for at least two weeks. With the Tigers later falling out of the AL Central race, the team elected to not activate him from the DL for the remainder of the season. During the 2015 season, Iglesias posted a .300 batting average in 416 at-bats, with 17 doubles, two home runs and 23 RBIs.\nOn January 15, 2016, the Tigers avoided arbitration with Iglesias, agreeing on a one-year, $2.1 million contract. Iglesias made one trip to the disabled list in 2016, after suffering a left hamstring strain in August, but still reached career highs with 137 games, 467 at-bats and 26 doubles, and had the lowest strikeout percentage of all major league baseball players (9.7%), as he also had the highest contact percentage on his swings in the major leagues (91.2%). He finished the season with a .255 batting average, 4 home runs and 32 RBI. \nFollowing the season, Iglesias was named a Gold Glove Award finalist for shortstop, along with Francisco Lindor and Andrelton Simmons. With just five errors in 574 chances, he posted an AL-best .991 fielding percentage.

Iglesias played in 114 games for the Angels, hitting .259 with eight home runs and 41 RBIs. On September 3, 2021, the Angels released Iglesias, clearing roster space for pitcher Janson Junk.\nSecond Stint with Red Sox (2021).\nOn September 6, 2021, Iglesias was signed by the Boston Red Sox. He made his formal return to the team later that day when he entered as a defensive substitution for Taylor Motter in the top of the eighth inning. Through the end of the regular season, Iglesias appeared 23 games with Boston, including 14 starts at second base, while batting .356 with one home run and seven RBIs.

        "title": "Charlotte 49ers men's basketball",
        "text": "The Charlotte 49ers men's basketball team represents the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNC Charlotte) in NCAA Division I basketball. Charlotte is a member of the American Athletic Conference (The American), which they joined in 2023 after 10 seasons in Conference USA. Charlotte, which had been a charter C-USA member from 1995, returned to that conference in 2013 after leaving in 2005 to join the Atlantic 10 Conference. The 49ers have also played in the Sun Belt Conference and were a member of the Metro Conference, which merged with the Great Midwest Conference to form Conference USA.\nThe basketball team has spent the better part of its history in the shadow of the state's four Atlantic Coast Conference teams. However, the 49ers have carved out a niche of their own, making 11 appearances in the NCAA tournament. In their first appearance, in 1977, they advanced all the way to the Final Four—at the time, the deepest run for a first-time tournament participant. They have also earned regular and post-season championships in three different conferences, as well as a victory in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) in 2023.\nThe 49ers play their home games in Dale F. Halton Arena, an on-campus facility that seats 9,105.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1965–1975).\nUNC Charlotte first fielded an intercollegiate basketball program in 1965. Chancellor Bonnie Cone appointed Harvey Murphy, previously a physical education instructor and head of the physical education program at the university, as the first head coach in school history. Murphy coached the 49ers in the NAIA as a member of the Dixie Conference from 1965 through 1970, winning the conference in 1969 and 1970.\nBill Foster was hired to succeed Harvey Murphy after the 1969–1970 season as the 49ers moved from the NAIA to Division I as an independent. Foster notched two 20-win seasons in 1973–1974 and 1974–1975 before moving on to coach at Clemson. Foster's lasting legacy on the program was bringing in two of the most notable players on the team which would advance to the 1977 Final Four: Cedric Maxwell and Melvin Watkins.\nLee Rose years (1975–1977).\nAfter Bill Foster left for Clemson, Lee Rose was hired as the head coach in 1975. Rose inherited a team coming off of two 20-win seasons and led them to the NIT championship game in his first year. The following season the 49ers became a charter member of the Sun Belt Conference.\nFinal Four.\nIn their first year in the Sun Belt, the 49ers tallied what is still the best season in school history. They swept the regular season and tournament titles, earning the program's first NCAA Tournament berth. The ensuing NCAA tournament run is still one of the most successful ever for a first-time participant. After beating Central Michigan in the first round 91–86, the 49ers dispatched Syracuse 81–59 to advance to the Elite Eight. The 49ers then took out heavily favored Michigan by a score of 75–68 to advance to the program's first and only Final Four—the first time that a first-time participant had ever advanced that far. Charlotte would fall to eventual champions Marquette in the national semifinals 51–49. Their final record was 28–5, still a school record for wins in a season.\nDespite the loss of the two leaders of the Final Four team from the previous season, Lee Rose guided the 49ers to a fifth consecutive 20-win season in 1977–1978. Rose would then leave to coach at Purdue for the 1978–1979 season. Rose's .800 winning percentage at Charlotte remains the highest in school history.\nPost-Rose years (1978–1985).\nFollowing Rose's departure, Mike Pratt, an assistant under Rose at Charlotte, was named the head coach for the 1978–1979 season. In his first and only head coaching job, Pratt could not maintain the success of the program under Rose, compiling a 56–52 record over four seasons with no postseason appearances. The best year under Pratt was the 1978–1979 season in which the 49ers earned a 16–11 record and a second place Sun Belt finish. Pratt was dismissed following the 1981–1982 season.\nFollowing Pratt's dismissal, the 49ers hired Hal Wissel as head basketball coach. Wissel was previously a successful coach at many levels, but his tenure would be the least successful in the Charlotte's history at the Division 1 level. After three seasons and a 22–62 record, Wissel was dismissed following the 1984–1985 season.\nJeff Mullins years (1985–1996).\nFollowing Wissel's dismissal, Jeff Mullins was hired as both head basketball coach and athletic director. Mullins guided the 49ers through multiple conference changes and kicked off the most successful, sustained run in school history.\nMullins inherited a last place Sun Belt team and things didn't improve in his first season with an 8–20 record. However, in just his second year he guided the 49ers back above .500 for the first time in five seasons, leading them to an 18–14 record in 1986–1987. Led by Sun Belt Player of the Year Byron Dinkins, Mullins coached the 49ers to the Sun Belt regular season and post-season championships and the program's first NCAA tournament berth since their Final Four run. Seeded 13th, the 49ers lost to 4th seed BYU in the first round of the Southeast Regional by a score of 98–92.\nThe following season the 49ers finished second in the Sun Belt and earned an NIT berth. In their final two seasons in the Sun Belt, Mullins led the 49ers to a 30–28 record with no postseason appearances.\nMetro Conference (1992–1995).\nPrior to the 1992–1993 season the 49ers moved to the Metro Conference. In their four seasons in the Metro Conference, the 49ers never finished lower than 4th in the standings, won one regular season conference title, and one post-season conference title. The success was rewarded with two NCAA Tournament berths, in 1992 and 1995, losing in the first round both times.\nConference USA.\nAfter the 1994–1995 season, the 49ers joined Conference USA. In what would be Mullins' last season, Charlotte went 14–15 in 1995–1996, finishing tied for 6th in the league. Mullins retired following that season as the all-time winningest coach in school history with 182 wins and also had more postseason appearances than all previous coaches combined.\nFormer on-the-court star and longtime assistant coach for the 49ers Melvin Watkins took over as head coach for the 1996–1997 season. Watkins had two successful seasons as the Charlotte head coach, leading the team into the second round of the NCAA tournament in both years. He left to take the head coaching job at Texas A&amp;M in 1998.\nBobby Lutz years (1998–2010).\nAfter Watkins left for Texas A&amp;M, Charlotte named Bobby Lutz its new head coach. Lutz was an assistant under both Watkins and Jeff Mullins at Charlotte. Lutz accepted the head coaching job at Gardner–Webb in 1995 only to resign two weeks later to accept the assistant job at his alma mater on Mullin's staff.\nLutz's run of success in Conference USA is arguably the best sustained stretch in Charlotte basketball history. The 49ers reached the NCAA Tournament in 5 of the 7 years they were in Conference USA under Lutz.\nIn his first season, Lutz guided the 49ers to a 10–6 record in CUSA. Seeded fifth in the conference tournament, the 49ers won four games in four days, taking out three of the top four seeds in the process to win the CUSA conference tournament for the first time. This earned Charlotte a 5 seed in the NCAA tournament. They defeated Rhode Island in the first round before falling to 13-seed Oklahoma in round two.\nThe 1999–2000 season would be defined by the passing of Charles Hayward in September 1999. Hayward lost a two-year battle with Leukemia, he would have his jersey retired. Charlotte would play to a 17–16 record and earn an NIT berth.\nThe 2000–2001 seasons saw the arrival of Rodney White who would become the top scoring freshman in the country and be named ESPN's National Freshmen of the Year. Led by White, Charlotte would win its second CUSA Tournament Title in three years and earn a 9 seed in the NCAA tournament with a 22–11 record. Charlotte would defeat Tennessee in the first round of the Midwest Regional before falling to #1 seed Illinois in the round of 32. White would leave Charlotte for the NBA draft and be selected 9th overall by the Detroit Pistons.\nOver the following three seasons the 49ers would earn two additional NCAA tournament bids, in 2002 and 2004, earning #9 seeds and being eliminated in the first round both years.\nThe 2004–2005 season would see the 49ers return to the top 25 behind eventual CUSA Player of the Year Eddie Basden, he would also win CUSA Defensive POY for the second straight season. The promising season would take a turn for the worse in the last few weeks. The 49ers lost a game on senior night at Louisville which would determine the regular season conference champion. They followed that with a loss on an emotional senior night at South Florida. They then drew a Memphis team in the CUSA tournament who had under-performed all year but caught fire at the end of the season. Charlotte was bounced from the first round of the CUSA tournament and had their season ended in round 1 of the NCAA tournament by NC State.\nAtlantic 10.\nFollowing the exodus of many of the top basketball programs from CUSA to the Big East in 2005, Charlotte was left as a non-football school in an increasingly weak basketball conference despite having the second best record in CUSA history at the time, trailing only Cincinnati. Charlotte eventually joined the Atlantic 10 for all sports along with fellow CUSA member Saint Louis. Lutz was not able to sustain the level of success he achieved in CUSA. Over the course of six seasons in the A10, Lutz's record was 83–75, compared to his record of 135–83 in CUSA. The 49ers earned two NIT bids under Lutz in the A10, going 1–2 in those tournaments. The 49ers fell apart to end the 2009–2010 season. With eight games to go in the regular season, they were 18-5 and in first place in the A10, and appeared well on their way to an NCAA bid. However, they went 1–7 the rest of the way, and didn't even receive an NIT bid. Lutz was dismissed following this collapse.\nLutz had more wins (218) and NCAA tournament appearances (5) than any other coach in Charlotte history. His firing was met with mixed emotions among students and fans.\nAlan Major years (2010–2015).\nOn April 12, 2010 Alan Major was announced as the new head coach of the Charlotte 49ers. The coaching search targeted assistants at successful high-level programs, Major was a member of Thad Matta's staff at Ohio State which included a national title game appearance. Throughout his career Major has a history of helping highly skilled big men develop into great NBA prospects. He coached two future #1 overall draft picks in Michael Olowokandi and Greg Oden while at Pacific and Ohio State, respectively. He also came in with A10 experience having been as assistant under Matta at Xavier.\nMajor's first season was headlined by the dismissal of one senior big man, Shamarri Spears, in the Fall and another, Phil Jones, not qualifying academically for the Spring semester. The early season schedule was highlighted by a 49–48 victory over #7 ranked Tennessee and a 2OT win at Georgia Tech. Following Jones being ruled ineligible, the team was left with just 8 scholarship players for the remainder of the season and would struggle in conference play, finishing with a 2–14 league record and failing to make the A10 conference tournament for the first time. The three-year postseason drought had been the longest for the program since Jeff Mullins took over in 1985.\nThe 2011–2012 season saw less off-the-court drama, although individual players were benched for disciplinary reasons, but there was little improvement in terms of wins and losses. The 49ers would finish with a 13–17 record, 5–11 in conference play. This was an improvement of Major's first year and earned them an A10 tournament spot, a first round loss at St. Joe's. Chris Braswell would average 15.6 points and 7.6 rebounds per game and be named to the A10 All-Conference Third Team. Pierriá Henry was among the nation's leaders in steals and earned a spot on the A10 All-Rookie Team.\nThe 2012–2013 season resulted in an improved 21–12 record and a berth in the NIT. The season was successful overall, but the 49ers lost four games in a row in February/March which removed them from NCAA tournament consideration. This was followed by a miraculous first round A10 tournament victory over Richmond in which Pierriá Henry took 11 free throws in the final 4.7 seconds of game time to overcome a 3-point deficit. Richmond was called for three technical fouls, one non-shooting foul and one shooting foul in that time. The 49ers followed this with a blowout loss to St. Louis in the 2nd round. In the NIT the 49ers were eliminated in round 1 at Providence.\nFollowing the 2012–13 season, Darion Clark announced he was leaving the program. Clark saw a total of seven minutes in the 49ers' two A10 tournament games, a large drop from his regular season average. In late April forward E. Victor Nickerson also announced he was transferring, leaving Charlotte with only 6 scholarship players on roster.\nReturn to Conference USA.\nThe 2013–2014 season, in which the 49ers would rejoin Conference USA and claim the Puerto Rico Tip-Off Championship by beating a ranked Michigan team; ended with a late season 6 game losing streak in conference play, and the 49ers finishing with a 17–14 record and a second round exit from the C-USA Tournament.\nHaving taken a medical leave of absence following the 2013–14 season, Coach Major would take another such leave during the second half of the 2014–15 season. Assistant Head Coach Ryan Odom would coach the team for the remainder of the season. Following the conclusion of the 2014–2015 season it was announced that Major would step down as head coach. His record as 49ers head coach was 67 wins to 70 losses with the program attaining an overall record during his tenure of 75 to 81. Significant milestones included winning the 2012 Great Alaska Shootout and 2013 Puerto Rico Tip-off tournaments and victories over #7 ranked Tennessee, #10 ranked Butler, and previous National Championship runners-up, #14 ranked Michigan.\nMark Price years (2015–2017).\nOn March 25, 2015, former NBA point guard and NBA Charlotte Hornets assistant coach, Mark Price was offered a five-year contract to become the 49ers head coach, which he accepted. Price was fired on December 14, 2017 after a 30-42 record in 2 1/2 seasons at Charlotte and was replaced by assistant coach Houston Fancher.\nRon Sanchez years (2018–2023).\nOn March 19, 2018, Ron Sanchez was named the 12th head coach in Charlotte 49ers men’s basketball program history. Sanchez was a former volunteer assistant at Indiana before going to Washington State. Sanchez was hired by Dick Bennett, and remained on the staff when Bennett’s son Tony took over. Sanchez accompanied Tony Bennett to Virginia in 2009 as an assistant and was promoted to associate head coach in 2015.\nOn June 6, 2023, Sanchez resigned to rejoin Bennett's staff at Virginia as associate head coach. Coincidentally, Sanchez left less than a month before Charlotte's move from C-USA to The American became official.\nOn June 15, 2023, associate head coach Aaron Fearne agreed to lead the team as interim head coach for the 2023-24 inaugural AAC season.\nAaron Fearne (2023-present).\nThe American.\nOn July 1, 2023 all Charlotte 49ers athletics programs joined the American Athletic Conference.\nInterim coach Aaron Fearne picked up his first win when the 49ers when they took down Maine. \nThe 49ers won their first game in American Conference play when they defeated number seventeen ranked Florida Atlantic. \nIt was Charlotte’s first win over a ranked team since 2013 and first ranked win over a team at home since 2010. \nOn February 12, 2024, Fearne was received a contract to become the official head coach of the Charlotte basketball program. \nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe 49ers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 11 times. Their combined record is 7–12.\nNIT results.\nThe 49ers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) seven times. Their combined record is 4–7.\nCBI results.\nThe 49ers have appeared in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) once in 2023, winning the tournament. Their combined record is 4–0.\nCoaches.\nHead coach history.\nList of Charlotte 49ers men's basketball head coaches\nNotable players.\nProfessional players.\nThe following Charlotte basketball players appeared in at least one game in the NBA:\nRivalries.\nHornet's Nest Trophy.\nCharlotte's 29-year rivalry with the Davidson Wildcats sees Mecklenburg County's only two Division I schools go head-to-head for the Hornet's Nest Trophy. The Hornets' Nest series began in the 1979-80 season. The teams have met 46 times. Charlotte leads the all-time series, 29-17. Although, in recent years Davidson has been the better team.\nOn November 12, 2019, Charlotte won back the Hornets Nest, winning 71-58, and snapping a 6 game losing streak.\nPast rivalries.\nCharlotte has had its fair share of intense rivalries. One of the most heated and intense rivalries was with the Bob Huggins-coached Cincinnati Bearcats of Conference USA. Throughout a ten-year period from 1995–96 to 2004–05, Charlotte managed to upset Cincinnati teams ranked #3, #8, #18, #20 in the country. Fueled by \"Huggins swallows\" pregame chants what became known as the Cincinnati Incident, a brawl broke out between Cincinnati and the Charlotte student section, when a Cincinnati player threw the basketball into the stands. This led to the creation of a 'buffer zone' being implemented behind the visiting team's bench. ESPN commentator Andy Katz provided this explanation on why Charlotte-Cincinnati was one of the juiciest rivalries in the country: \"The games are hotly contested usually and the fans in Charlotte don't like Cincinnati. They get up for this game more than any other.\""

An article in the 28 May 1938 edition of The New York Times described the political situation in Czechoslovakia as a “powder barrel” about which Soviet spokespersons “continued to evince concern all week over the possibilities of a general war blazing up from the Czechoslovakia situation Also, the Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer stated, in an article in their 6 July 1938 edition, “In the midst of the gravest crisis experienced since the foundation of Czechoslovakia, Prague is celebrating the tenth Congress of the Slavonic Gymnastic Movement called the Sokol, or Falcon”. It was due to this political context that the 1938 World Championships were under-attended. A Sokol publication stated “Only one thing they were not that happy about. The Hungarians, who were an excellent team in Budapest and Berlin, and the Germans, who were 0.5% ahead of our team in Berlin, did not have their strong competitors here. Both teams were registered for the competition and withdrew only at the last minute. The Dutch team apologized on the eve of the competition and did not participate.” \nMen.\nAll-around.\nA total of 59 competitors were individually ranked in the all-around competition.\nWomen.\nAll-around.\nA total of 32 woman gymnasts were individually ranked for the all-around competition.\nWith the context of both the previous World Championships which were the first with a women's segment to the competition as well as the interceding Olympic Games, the outcome and composition of the women's all-around podium at these championships was significant. Reportedly, cheating occurred at the first 1934 women's installment of these games which, when undone, allowed the Czechoslovakian team and their foremost star Vlasta Děkanová to be the first-place finishers, as a team and individual, respectively. Going into the 1936 Olympics, the Czechoslovakians and Děkanová were the favorites, but had to take 2nd place behind the home-ground advantaged German team (who did not compete at the 1934 Worlds), and the top three scoring individuals were all German. These 1938 Worlds were hosted in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and this time all three spots on the all-around podium were occupied by individuals from the Czechoslovakian team. Děkanová (a Bohemian) successfully defended her first-place finish from the previous worlds, Zdeňka Veřmiřovská (a Moravian) won silver, and Matylda Pálfyová (a Slovakian) won bronze. The three regions from which each hailed within the former Czechoslovakia were the 3 largest and most significant regions of that nation, so the fullest representation possible of geographical diversity within that country was made manifest on this all-around podium.\n† Compulsory Uneven Bars\n†† Optional Uneven Bars"

The tournament was first held in Australia as part of the 2008 Festival of World Cups and was upgraded to a centrepiece event in 2021.\nHistory.\nThe inaugural tournament took place as part of the 2008 Festival of World Cups and was held in Sydney, Australia. The four teams participating were Australia, England, France and a Barbarians V Pacific Islands team. The fourth team were a replacement for New Zealand who withdrew before the start of the competition. England were the first winners, defeating hosts Australia 44–12 in the final.\nIn 2013 the tournament was held in Gillingham, England. The six teams that took part were Australia, England, France, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. France won the competition, defeating England 42–40 in the final. Wales won 16–12 against Australia in the third-place play-off and Ireland defeated Scotland 36–14 to finish fifth.\nFrance hosted the 2017 tournament and won 38–34 in the final against England to retain the title. Seven teams took part in the tournament with the semi-finalists from 2013 placed in Group A and Italy, Spain and Scotland in Group B. Australia, who had intended to host the tournament, finished third after defeating newcomers Italy 58–45. Spain, who were also making their first appearance at the world cup, lost 45–66 to Wales in the fifth-place play-off match.\nThe 2021 tournament (played in 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic) saw the United States compete at the world cup for the first time. Norway, who were also due to make their debut, withdrew from the competition in February 2022. It was the first time that the wheelchair tournament was played simultaneously with the men's and women's competitions. The hosts England defeated France 28–24 in the final in front of a wheelchair rugby league world record crowd of 4,526 at Manchester Central.\nFormat.\nThe tournament has been played using different formats depending on the number of teams participating. In 2013 the six teams were divided into two groups. Each team played the two teams in their group and one team from the other group. This determined the qualifiers for the semi-finals which were followed by the play-off matches and final. In 2017 the seven teams were also divided into two groups, but this time Group A contained the four top ranked teams and Group B was made up of the lower ranked teams. The top two from Group A qualified for the semi-finals and were joined by the winners of play-offs between the top two Group B teams and the remaining Group A sides. The 2021 tournament had two groups of four teams with the top two from each progressing to the semi-finals.\nTrophy.\nIn November 2019 a new trophy for the wheelchair tournament was unveiled. It shares a similar overall appearance to the men's and women's trophies and features imagery of wheelchair athletes in action."

There were 57 bracelet events, culminating in the $10,000 No Limit Hold'em Championship that began on July 5. The November Nine concept returned for the third year, with the Main Event finalists returning on November 6.\nA notable change from 2009 was the revamping of the $50,000 buy-in tournament. From its inception in 2006 through 2009, it had been a H.O.R.S.E. event in which play rotated between Texas hold 'em, Omaha 8-or-better, Razz, stud, and stud 8-or-better, all played with a limit betting structure. In 2010, it became an \"8-game\" tournament, rotating between the five H.O.R.S.E. games followed by rounds of no-limit hold 'em, pot-limit Omaha (high only), and limit 2–7 triple draw. Once the final table was reached, play switched exclusively to no-limit hold 'em (as was the case in the 2006 H.O.R.S.E. event). The tournament, now known as The Poker Player's Championship, was moved to the second spot on the WSOP schedule, preceded only by the restricted $500 Casino Employees No Limit Hold'em event. Thus, the 2010 WSOP open events started with The Poker Player's Championship and ended with the No Limit Hold'em Championship/Main Event. Several celebrities were in attendance, including Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, and Ray Romano. \nMain Event.\nThe $10,000 No Limit Texas Hold 'em Championship Main Event began on July 5 with the first of four starting days. Each of the participants at the 2010 WSOP Main Event received 30,000 in tournament chips for the $10,000 buy-in event. After reaching the final table of nine players on July 17, the final table was delayed until November 6.\nThe total number of entrants in the 2010 Main Event was 7,319 with a prize pool of $68,798,600 with the winner receiving $8,944,138 for first place. The payout \"bubble\" was reached during Day 4 at 747 players, each of whom earned a minimum of $19,263. The bubble finisher (748th place) was Tim McDonald, a professional angler and recreational poker player from Lexington, Kentucky; he received the consolation prize of a guaranteed seat in the 2011 WSOP Main Event. Matt Affleck, with his 15th-place finish in this year’s championship combined with an 80th-place in 2009, outlasted 13,718 players in back-to-back years, which is the fourth-most in WSOP history. (Stefan Mattsson - 15,052 in 2006 &amp; 2007, Humberto Brenes - 15,012 in 2006 &amp; 2007, Joseph Hachem - 14,153 in 2005 &amp; 2006)\nThe Main Event was a draw for many celebrities to play including: \nOf these celebrities, Northug (653rd), Fenech (585th), and Buffer (478th) made the money.\nOther notable high finishes.\n\"NB: This list is restricted to top 30 finishers with an existing Wikipedia entry.\"\nBracelet.\nAmerican jewelry designer Steve Soffa was chosen by the World Series of Poker to design and manufacture the entire set of bracelets for the 2010 World Series of Poker."

Owned and operated by the city's Department of Recreation and Parks, the par-71 course in the Cheviot Hills neighborhood was designed by William P. Bell &amp; William H. Johnson in 1947. The fairways are Bermuda Grass and the greens are Bent Grass.\nIt hosted the Los Angeles Open on the PGA Tour seventeen times, and also was the site of events on the Senior PGA Tour and LPGA Tour.\nHistory.\nThe site was originally a private club named Rancho Country Club. The club ran into some tax problems and the federal government took ownership to satisfy the tax debt and leased it back to the club. Several citizens spearheaded an effort to make the site into a city park. Their efforts were rewarded in 1945 with the creation of Cheviot Hills Park, a park that included the golf course, tennis courts, and baseball fields. Hillcrest Country Club is adjacent to the northeast, separated by Motor Avenue.\nThe Los Angeles Open moved to Rancho Park in 1956 and stayed through 1972 (except for 1968) and hosted a final time in 1983. A bronze plaque is located on the 508-yard par-5 ninth hole (currently the 18th hole) along the course's western boundary. It commemorates an incident in the first round of the L.A. Open in 1961; reigning Masters and U.S. Open champion Arnold Palmer carded a twelve after a great tee shot was followed by four consecutive shots out of bounds. The hole narrows near the green, squeezing in between the driving range on the right and Patricia Avenue on the left; he hit the first two to the right, then two left. Five years later, Palmer tied the course record with 62 in the third round to take a seven-shot lead, then held on to win by a stroke, the second of his three victories here (1963, 1966, 1967).\nCharlie Sifford was the first African-American to earn a PGA card in 1961; he won the L.A. Open on the course in 1969 on the first playoff hole for his second tour win. It happened on January 12, during the New York Jets' historic upset win in Super Bowl III in Miami.\nJack Nicklaus earned his first tour paycheck at Rancho Park as a 21-year-old rookie in early 1962; he was over twenty strokes back in the $45,000 event and earned less than thirty four dollars. He never won the L.A. Open; his best finish was a solo runner-up in 1978 at Riviera Country Club with an uncharacteristic stumble in the final holes.\nAlso age 21, Nancy Lopez gained her second career win at Rancho Park in the Sunstar Classic, the second of nine victories for her in 1978. She successfully defended in 1979 with a birdie on the final hole to win by a stroke. The 1980 event was won by JoAnne Carner, shortened to 54 holes after the first round was cancelled by heavy rain."

        "title": "Robert Morris Colonials men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Robert Morris Colonials men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents Robert Morris University. The team played its home games at the Clearview Arena, located at the RMU Island Sports Center in Neville Township, Pennsylvania, United States. The Colonials were a member of the Atlantic Hockey Conference. Until the 2009–10 season, the Colonials were a member of College Hockey America.\nHistory.\nRobert Morris had a successful club hockey team for several years before rumors started circulating in the early 2000s that the school would create an NCAA Division I program. In December 2002, reports first surfaced that the school was interested in purchasing the RMU Island Sports Center, which would house a men's and women's ice hockey team. On August 8, 2003, the school officially purchased the 32-acre complex – complete with a 1,100-seat hockey arena – for $10 million. The complex is located in Neville Island, only a few miles from RMU's campus in Moon Township. Just 12 days later, on August 20, 2003, Robert Morris athletic director Susan Hofacre officially announced that the Colonials would field an NCAA men's ice hockey team for the 2004–05 season. At the same time, the school added men's and women's lacrosse and women's field hockey as part of an expansion of the athletic department. Two days later, the school hired former Western Michigan defenceman Derek Schooley as its first head coach.\nIn January 2004, before the school had ever played a game, they were accepted into the College Hockey America conference. Typically, most new NCAA schools play as an Independent in their first years, but a unique series of events led to RMU being immediately accepted into the conference. The fledgling six-team conference was first given an automatic bid to the 2003 NCAA tournament. However, in January 2004, CHA member Findlay announced they would drop hockey from its athletic program effective at the end of the 2003–04 season. This left the CHA one team short of the six required to keep their automatic bid into the NCAA tournament. As RMU was the only NCAA team not already attached to a conference, the CHA invited RMU to join immediately for the 2004–05 season. The school accepted on January 29, 2004.\nSchooley quickly moved to secure the Colonials' first recruiting class and hired two assistant coaches. Nevertheless, the Colonials were predictably overmatched in their first year as an NCAA team. The young squad consisted of 22 freshmen and no seniors as Schooley built for the school's future. In its first season, the Colonials finished last in the conference with an 8–21–4 record.\nAt the start of the 2005–06 season, the Colonials were reminded how much work the program needed to do when they were stunned by the Penn State University club team in a 3–2 exhibition loss prior to the season. Two games later, however, RMU shocked CCHA member Western Michigan in a 5–2 victory that Schooley called \"the biggest win for our program.\" The Colonials improved to 12–20–3 in their second season while advancing to the CHA semifinals for the first time.\nIn 2006–07, the Colonials improved yet again, finishing 14–19–2. On January 7, 2007, the Colonials beat nationally ranked Notre Dame for their first ever victory over a ranked team. The squad advanced to the CHA tournament final, where they came up just short of qualifying for their first ever NCAA tournament against Alabama–Huntsville. The Colonials jumped out to a 4–0 first period lead and looked set for their first conference championship before the Chargers mounted a frantic comeback that ended with a 5–4 overtime victory.\nIt was more of the same for the Colonials over the next two years. In 2007–08, the squad finished a school-record 15–15–4 (including a win over #8 ranked Boston University) but again came up short in the CHA tournament. In 2008–09, the school finished only 10–19–7 before reaching the CHA tournament final against Bemidji State. Once again, the Colonials were left heartbroken, as they lost in overtime for the second time in three years.\nBy this time, it was clear that the CHA would soon disband. In 2006, Air Force left the league, leaving the conference with only five teams (one short of the six required to retain the NCAA autobid). Given two years to keep their autobid before losing it, the CHA began the search for a sixth member – likely a club team, as all current Division I teams were already in a conference. After no school expressed interest in joining, Wayne State announced just prior to the 2007–08 season that they would disband their team following the season. Following Wayne State's departure, saving the CHA was all but impossible, and Robert Morris applied for membership into Atlantic Hockey (AHA). In January 2009, the AHA announced that both RMU and Niagara's applications were unanimously approved, paving the way for the schools to join the conference for the 2010–11 season. Robert Morris and Penn State were the hosts of the inaugural Three Rivers Classic NCAA hockey tournament at the Consol Energy Center in December, 2012.\nOn May 26, 2021, Robert Morris University announced it would be cutting the men's and women's ice hockey programs. On December 17, 2021, it was announced the program would be reinstated for the 2023–24 season.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nStatistical leaders.\nSource:\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nAwards and honors.\nCHA.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nStudent-Athlete of the Year\nAll-Conference teams.\nFirst Team All-CHA\nSecond Team All-CHA\nAll-CHA Rookie Team\nAtlantic Hockey.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nBest Defensive Forward\nBest Defenseman\nIndividual Sportsmanship Award\nRegular season Scoring Trophy\nCoach of the Year\nMost Valuable Player in tournament\nAll-Conference teams.\nFirst Team All-Atlantic Hockey\nSecond Team All-Atlantic Hockey\nThird Team All-Atlantic Hockey\nAtlantic Hockey All-Rookie Team\nRobert Morris Colonials Hall of Fame.\nThe following is a list of people associated with the men's ice hockey program who were elected into the Robert Morris Colonials Hall of Fame (induction date in parentheses).\nColonials in the NHL.\nSource:\nRobert Morris has yet to have an alumnus reach the NHL."

        "title": "Croatia at the FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "The national team of Croatia has competed in the FIFA World Cup six times, finishing on podium on three occasions. Since gaining independence in 1991, Croatia has appeared in and qualified for the 1998, 2002, 2006, 2014, 2018 and 2022 editions of the tournament. Croatia's best result since gaining admission into FIFA in 1992, was securing second place against France in the 2018 World Cup Final, where they lost 4–2. The national side has collected three World Cup medals, two bronze (1998, 2022) and one silver (2018). Due to its small geography and populace, Croatia is often one of the smallest countries competing in the tournament. They are second-smallest country by population (after Uruguay) and land mass (after the Netherlands) to reach a World Cup Final. \nThe World Cup is an international association football competition contested by the men's national teams of the members of FIFA, the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to World War II. The tournament consists of two parts, the three-year qualification phase and the one-month final phase. The current format involves 32 teams competing for the title, at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. It is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 1 billion people watching.\nCroatia in France 1998.\nIn the draw for the final tournament, held on 4 December 1997 at Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, Croatia was drawn to play in Group H, along with two other teams which qualified for the World Cup for the first time, Jamaica and Japan, and two-time World Cup winners Argentina. In their first match Croatia beat Jamaica 3–1, in a game memorable for Croatia's first ever World Cup goal, an opener scored by Mario Stanić in the 27th minute. Croatia went on to beat Japan 1–0 before losing their third group stage match against Argentina 0–1, in a game which was of little importance as both teams had already qualified for the round of 16.\nIn round of 16, Croatia faced Group G winners Romania (who had finished top of their group in front of England) and won the game through a penalty converted by Davor Šuker in stoppage time of the first half after a foul on Aljoša Asanović by Gabriel Popescu. After that Croatia faced Germany in the quarter-finals, in a game which was at the time touted by the Croatian media as a great opportunity to get back at Germany as it was them who had knocked out Croatia in the UEFA Euro 1996 quarter-finals two years earlier. In the 40th minute Christian Wörns received a direct red card and was sent off for fouling Davor Šuker, and Robert Jarni opened the scoring eight minutes later in stoppage time of the first half. Goran Vlaović and Davor Šuker added a second and third and the game ended in a 3–0 win, which is still regarded by fans and the media as one of the most memorable matches Croatia ever played.\nCroatia went on to face hosts France in the semi-finals, but lost the game 1–2 when an opener scored by Šuker in the 46th minute was immediately equalised by Lilian Thuram the following minute. Thuram also scored France's second goal in the 69th minute. These were the only two goals Thuram ever scored for France in an international career spanning from 1994 to 2008 which saw him earn a total of 147 caps. After Croatia's exit manager Blažević was heavily criticized by Croatian press for not sending in Robert Prosinečki soon enough after France took the lead (Prosinečki came on as a substitute for Mario Stanić just minutes before the final whistle). Croatia captain Zvonimir Boban tried to take the blame for the defeat saying that he felt he needed to be substituted but wanted to stay on the pitch just a little while longer (it was his defending mistake which led to Thuram's equaliser).\nAfter being knocked out in the semi-finals, Croatia looked for consolation against Netherlands in the third place match played just three days later at Parc des Princes. Croatia went on to win 2–1 through goals by Šuker and Prosinečki, but after the final whistle Dražen Ladić was labelled player of the match, for a career-best performance which saw him save numerous shots from Patrick Kluivert, Clarence Seedorf and Marc Overmars.\nSquad.\nManager Miroslav Blažević included the following 22 players in the finals tournament squad. The 16 players who were capped at least once in one of the seven matches Croatia played in France are highlighted in bold. The remaining six players were unused at the tournament (defenders Goran Jurić and Anthony Šerić, defensive midfielder Mamić, striker Ardian Kozniku, and second and third-choice goalkeepers Marijan Mrmić and Vladimir Vasilj). On the other hand, six players appeared in all seven matches: goalkeeper Dražen Ladić, defender Slaven Bilić, midfielders Aljoša Asanović, Mario Stanić, Robert Jarni, and striker Davor Šuker.\nOut of 11 goals scored by Croatia at the tournament, six were scored by Davor Šuker, who was awarded the Golden Shoe Award for the top goalscorer of the tournament, as well as the Silver Ball Award as the second most outstanding player of the tournament (behind Ronaldo of Brazil). Robert Prosinečki (who was retroactively given the 1990 FIFA World Cup Best Young Player Award, where he had appeared for Yugoslavia), also scored two goals in matches against Jamaica and the Netherlands, which made him the only player in World Cup history to score goals at finals tournaments for two different countries.\nFor three players (Jarni, Prosinečki and Šuker) this was their second appearance at the World Cup, having been members of Yugoslavia squad at the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Alen Bokšić would have been fourth, having been a key player in Croatia's qualifying campaign, but he was dropped from the tournament squad after sustaining an injury just months before the tournament in France.\nLegacy.\nBy beating Netherlands, Croatia finished third in their World Cup debut, a feat matched only by Eusébio's Portugal in the 1966 World Cup 32 years earlier. Consequently, Croatia reached their highest ever FIFA ranking when they were third in the world for three months between January and March 1999 and were given the Best Mover of the Year Award in 1998, the only team so far which won the award twice (having been Best Movers in 1994). Upon returning to Croatia, the whole squad was decorated by President Franjo Tuđman, and were nicknamed \"Brončani\" (\"The Bronze Ones\") and \"Vatreni'\" (\"The Fiery Ones\") in the media. The latter stuck as a permanent nickname for the national team.\nMost players continued playing for the team throughout the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifiers, but after Croatia failed to qualify manager Miroslav Blažević resigned and soon after that some of the players retired from the national team. The next manager Mirko Jozić kept some of the remaining members of the Bronze Generation and even took them to 2002 FIFA World Cup (such as Šuker, Prosinečki, Jarni, Stanić, Soldo, Vlaović, Šimić), but they failed to make an impact at the tournament and almost all of them retired soon afterwards, but a number of them later became prominent figures in Croatian football.\nZvonimir Boban went into sports publishing and took over as CEO of Croatia's sports daily \"Sportske novosti\" in 2005 and worked as a commentator for Italian television stations. Šuker launched his line of sports apparel and established a football academy carrying his name. Zvonimir Soldo, Robert Jarni, Slaven Bilić, Igor Štimac and Dražen Ladić all took up managing jobs (Soldo coached Dinamo Zagreb to a Double in 2008, while Jarni, Bilić and Štimac all had managerial spells at Hajduk Split). Štimac later became chairman of the association of Prva HNL clubs, the body regulating top flight football in Croatia, and Bilić took over as Croatia manager in 2006, hiring Aljoša Asanović, Robert Prosinečki and Marijan Mrmić as his assistants. Dražen Ladić took up managing the Croatia under-21 team in 2006, and Krunoslav Jurčić is the current manager at Dinamo Zagreb, having been appointed in 2009. Miroslav Blažević later managed a number of clubs in Croatia, Slovenia and Switzerland before taking over as Bosnia and Herzegovina manager in 2008 and sensationally leading them to the verge of qualifying for the 2010 World Cup.\nCroatia in South Korea/Japan 2002.\nCroatia qualified for their second world cup after navigating Group 6 of UEFA's World Cup qualifications without a loss, finishing first and directly qualifying ahead of Belgium, Scotland, Latvia and San Marino.\nCroatia qualification led by manager Miroslav Blažević, but after tying the initial two matches, he was replaced by Mirko Jozić, who would manage the team during the World Cup.\nDespite defeating Italy in the second game of the group stage, Croatia, needing a win against Ecuador confirm qualification for the knockout stages, could not break down the Ecuadorian defense, and only solid goalkeeping from Stipe Pletikosa prevented the South Americans from winning by a greater scoreline. A late Italy goal meant a draw would not send Croatia through, requiring two goals in three minutes to advance, but the \"Vatreni\" did not score and exited the competition at the group stage for the first time.\nCroatia in Germany 2006.\nCroatia qualified automatically for the World Cup after topping their qualification group without losing a game, ahead of Sweden, who tied on points and had a better goal difference but who Croatia had defeated twice. Future superstar Luka Modrić made the final World Cup squad in spite of not playing in a single qualification match.\nCroatia selected Bad Brückenau in northern Bavaria as their training base. The team played four warm-up matches in preparation for the World Cup, defeating Austria in Vienna 4–1, drawing Iran in Osijek 2–2, before losing to Poland and Spain in friendlies in Germany and Switzerland, respectively.\nA pitch incident marred Croatia's opening game against Brazil, a 1–0 loss, when a Croatian fan ran onto the pitch near Dado Pršo. Security also confiscated 823 flares, but two flares were successfully lit in the Croatian supporters' section.\nAfter a scoreless draw with Japan, Croatia entered their final match against Australia needing a win to advance. Darijo Srna scored the opener after two minutes and Croatia immediately began playing defensively to protect their lead, allowing the Australians to pressure for the rest of the first half until Craig Moore converted a penalty in the 38th minute after a Stjepan Tomas handball. A defensive error by Australian keeper Kalac led to Niko Kovač putting Croatia up again in the 58th, but this led to Australia pressing again with Harry Kewell equalising with eleven minutes left. The final part of the game was marred by a second yellow card shown to Josip Šimunić without him getting sent off by referee Graham Poll - Šimunić would eventually receive his sending off after a \"third\" yellow card in the game's final moments.\nPlayers with most appearances.\nLuka Modrić is the only Croatian player to ever win the Golden Ball award. He was team captain in 2018, when Croatia reached the World Cup final.\nAwards.\nTeam Awards\nIndividual Awards"

        "title": "List of North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball head coaches",
        "text": "The North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team plays at the Division I level of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The Tar Heels originally did not play within any athletic conference, but joined the Southern Conference in 1921 when it was first established. After playing in the Southern Conference for 22 years, North Carolina left in 1953 to join the newly created ACC. The Tar Heels play their home games in the Dean E. Smith Center, named after the 15th head coach Dean Smith. They previously played in Carmichael Auditorium, Woollen Gymnasium, The Tin Can, and began their existence playing in Bynum Gymnasium, which is now home to the admissions office for the university's graduate school programs.\nThere have been 19 head coaches in the history of Carolina basketball and the team has played two seasons without one. The program has played 3,151 games across 112 seasons from the program's inaugural 1910–11 season to the current year, 2021–22. Three Tar Heel coaches have led the team to an NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship: Frank McGuire in 1957; Smith in 1982 and 1993; and Roy Williams in 2005, 2009, and 2017. Smith, in 1971, led North Carolina to its only National Invitation Tournament (NIT) championship. North Carolina also received a retroactive national championship for the 1923–24 team coached by Norman Shepard, which was given by the Helms Athletic Foundation. Eleven coaches have won the conference regular season by having the best overall regular season record with the Tar Heels: Norman Shepard, Monk McDonald, Harlan Sanborn, Bo Shepard, Bill Lange, Walter Skidmore, Ben Carnevale, McGuire, Smith, Matt Doherty, and Williams. Eleven coaches have won the conference tournament with the Tar Heels: Norman Shepard, McDonald, Sanborn, Bo Shepard, Lange, Skidmore, Carnevale, McGuire, Smith, Bill Guthridge, and Williams.\nSmith had the longest tenure at North Carolina, coaching for 36 seasons, and is the all-time leader in games coached (1,133) and wins at the school (879). Smith's 879 wins were the most of any NCAA men's Division I coach at the time of his retirement in 1997. Smith was the head coach for United States Men's Basketball that won an Olympic Gold Medal in 1976 while also working as the head coach of North Carolina, a feat that no other North Carolina coach has replicated. Several coaches both played for and coached basketball at North Carolina. Davis, McDonald, and Doherty played for and coached the men's varsity basketball team. McDonald and Doherty played on teams that were awarded national championships, McDonald on the 1923–24 team and Doherty on the 1981–82 team. Williams both played for and coached the North Carolina men's junior varsity team. Davis also had a stint as the JV head coach while on the bench under Williams. Brothers Norman and Bo Shepard are the only two head coaches to be related to each other. Norman Shepard is the all-time leader in winning percentage, having never lost a game. Statistically, Cartmell has been the least successful coach of the Tar Heels, with a winning percentage of .510. No coach has had an overall losing record at North Carolina. Six coaches have received coaching awards while the head coach of North Carolina: Carnevale, McGuire, Smith, Guthridge, Doherty, and Williams. Carnevale, McGuire, Smith, and Williams have all been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. Roy Williams was hired in 2003, and retired following a school-record three national championships in 2021.\nThe current head coach is Hubert Davis, who played under Smith from 1988 to 1992 and served as an assistant to Williams for nine seasons prior to being elevated to the head coach position. Upon Davis' appointment as head coach he became the 19th coach in program history, and the first African-American to hold the position."

        "text": "The 2006 NRL Grand Final was the conclusive and premiership-deciding match of the NRL's 2006 Telstra Premiership season. It was played between the first-placed Melbourne Storm and the third-placed Brisbane Broncos clubs on the night of Sunday, 1 October. The 2006 grand final was the first ever to feature teams which were both from cities outside the borders of New South Wales, in this case the capitals of Queensland and Victoria, yet was played at the traditional venue of Sydney's Telstra Stadium. It was the first time the two sides had met in a grand final. They had played each other twice during the 2006 regular season, with Melbourne winning both times. The Melbourne side went into the grand final as heavy favorites, having won the minor premiership (although this was later discounted when salary cap breaches at the club were exposed in 2010). Both teams were looking to keep their perfect grand final records intact: Brisbane with 5/5 and the Melbourne side with 1/1 heading into the game.\nBackground.\nThe 2006 NRL season was the 99th season of professional rugby league football in Australia and the ninth run by the National Rugby League. Fifteen clubs competed for the 2006 Telstra Premiership over the 26 rounds of the regular season. Eight of these teams qualified for the four-week finals series\nBrisbane Broncos.\nThe 2006 Brisbane Broncos season was the nineteenth in the club's history. Coached by Wayne Bennett and captained by Darren Lockyer, they finished the regular season in 3rd place before going on to reach their 6th grand final.\nMelbourne Storm.\nThe 2006 Melbourne Storm season was the 9th in the club's history. Coached by Craig Bellamy and captained by Cameron Smith, they won a record 20 out of 24 regular season games to finish in first place and win the minor premiership, eight points clear of the second-placed Canterbury. The Melbourne club then reached their 2nd grand final as heavy favorites.\nTeams.\nMatt Geyer was the only remaining Melbourne Storm player from their 1999 premiership winning team and the only person at the club with grand final experience. Scott Hill (who had missed the 1999 grand final with injury) was playing his 200th and final game in the NRL. By contrast, around half of the Brisbane Broncos players had premiership rings, most of them from the club's 1998 and 2000 grand final wins, while Justin Hodges was the only player in the Broncos squad that had won elsewhere, being part of the Sydney Roosters' 2002 premiership team. It was to be the last rugby league match for Broncos veteran Shane Webcke before retirement.\nMatch details.\nA crowd of 79,609 people turned out, with Hoodoo Gurus and INXS performing before the match. \nReferee Paul Simpkins was chosen to officiate his first NRL grand final, with Bill Harrigan the video referee.\n1st Half.\nThe first points of the match came from a penalty in the ninth minute. Brisbane's Shaun Berrigan, playing at hooker, tried to burrow over Melbourne's try-line from dummy half but was ruled to have had the ball taken from his arms by Billy Slater in a two-man tackle. The resulting penalty kick by captain Darren Lockyer in front of the posts was a gift two points for the Brisbane side to take an early 2-0 lead. Three minutes later, Melbourne halfback Cooper Cronk kicked a 40/20 coming out of his side's territory. Following the subsequent scrum in an attacking position, the Melbourne side raided Brisbane's line and got the first try of the match. Scott Hill did well to evade a few attempted tackles and shoot a remarkable pass around the back of a Brisbane defender and into the arms of winger Steve Turner who dived over out wide. Cameron Smith missed the conversion, leaving the score at 4-2. Brisbane then got a scrum of their own close to Melbourne's line after Turner knocked on trying to take a Lockyer bomb. Lockyer, moving across-field fed the ball back inside to Justin Hodges who went over untouched to put the ball down near the posts, affording the Brisbane captain another easy kick. No more points were scored in the first half and Brisbane went into the break with an 8-4 lead. Darren Lockyer was limping around in the dressing room but went on to play through the rest of the game.\n2nd Half.\nEight minutes into the second half, a high tackle by Justin Hodges on Cameron Smith close to Brisbane's line resulted in a minor scuffle and a penalty to the Melbourne side. Melbourne captain Smith decided to take the tap and attack Brisbane's line and a close-range try to Matt King resulted. The scores were then level at 8-all, with the kick to come. Smith, also Melbourne's first-choice goal-kicker, was having a problem with his kicking leg so the task fell onto Matt Geyer whose conversion attempt went wide. Ten minutes later a penalty was awarded to the Broncos after a high shot from Billy Slater on Shaun Berrigan and Corey Parker's kick was successful, giving his side a two-point lead at 10-8. Following the restart kick from Melbourne, Brisbane were working the ball out of their own half and on the fifth tackle scored a brilliant grand final try. From dummy half Berrigan ran then passed back inside to Lockyer who gave a short ball on to Parker who did likewise for Casey McGuire. Before being tackled McGuire tossed the ball blindly back over his head and it was picked up by Lockyer who spun out of a tackle then passed it to Tonie Carroll. Without losing momentum, Carroll passed the ball on to a flying Brent Tate who raced to the corner for the try. The conversion attempt from near the sideline was missed by Parker so the Brisbane side led by six with seventeen minutes of play remaining. A couple of minutes later Melbourne appeared to have scored their third try when a bomb by Cronk was leapt for but unsuccessfully taken by both a Brisbane and a Melbourne player. On its way down the ball was snatched from the air by King who looked to have put it down for his second try but the video referee ruled that the ball had gone forward off the Storm so it was disallowed. In the seventy-third minute, after a strong run by prop Shane Webcke (the oldest player on the field) put him in good field position, Lockyer snapped away a successful field goal. This gave Brisbane a 7-point buffer. A frustrated Melbourne side were unable to score in the remaining minutes as Brisbane ground their way towards full-time, the score 15-8 at the final siren.\nPost-match.\nBrisbane's Shaun Berrigan, playing in his new role as hooker, received the Clive Churchill Medal for man-of-the-match. His dummy half raids and effective defence were seen as instrumental in his team's victory.\nBrisbane's victory was the club's sixth premiership in their 19 seasons and it broke what was at the time their longest premiership drought (five years). They suffered 11 losses during the season (including those to non-finals teams the Cowboys (twice), Wests Tigers and the wooden spooners, South Sydney), the most ever by a premiership-winning team. The win also enabled Brisbane to maintain their 100% victory record in grand finals, making it six from six. This also made Wayne Bennett the most successful Australian rugby league club coach of all time in terms of premierships won. In addition the grand final victory provided the perfect farewell for retiring Broncos prop-forward Shane Webcke, who left the playing field with a grand final victory in his final match. Also departing the NRL were Casey McGuire and Scott Hill, both bound for the Super League.\n2006's grand final set a new record for the second highest ever television audience in Australia for a rugby league match since the introduction of the OzTam ratings system in 2001, behind only the previous season's grand final. Melbourne's television audience for the match was higher than Sydney's.\nMatch summary.\n&lt;section begin=scoreboard /&gt;\n&lt;section end=scoreboard /&gt;\n2007 World Club Challenge.\nHaving won the NRL grand final, the Brisbane Broncos had earned the right to play against 2006's Super League XI Champions, St. Helens in the following February's World Club Challenge. St Helens won 18–14."

        "title": "2011 Cricket World Cup Group B",
        "text": "Play in Group B of the 2011 Cricket World Cup took place from 19 February to 20 March 2011. The group consisted of hosts India and Bangladesh, along with England, Ireland, Netherlands, West Indies and South Africa. The top four teams advanced to the quarter-finals.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\nIndia vs Bangladesh.\nThe World Cup opened with a match between co-hosts Bangladesh and India, with this being the only match India, the hot favorites, were not playing at home in the tournament. Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan won the toss and sent India in to bat; however his decision was quickly proved wrong. Virender Sehwag hit the first ball of the tournament for four, and he along with Sachin Tendulkar added 69 for the first wicket at over a run a ball until the latter was run out after a mix-up. Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir then had their team cruise to 152/1, when Gambhir was bowled by Mahmudullah but that did not stop Sehwag, who cruised to his century and then rapidly accelerated along with Virat Kohli. India cruised past 300, and Sehwag posted a career-best 175 before getting out, and Kohli also got his ton as India posted a daunting 370/4 at the end of their 50 overs.\nBangladesh started off rapidly in their chase, getting 51 runs in the first five overs without losing a wicket; but soon, at the score of 56, Imrul Kayes played on to a Munaf Patel delivery. Tamim Iqbal got a half-century, but the Bangladesh run-rate slowed after that and they weren't in the hunt, and at the end they got to 283/9 without really challenging the Indian total.\nVirender Sehwag's score of 175 was his 14th ODI hundred, and the fourth highest score in the history of the Cricket World Cup.\nNetherlands vs England.\nNetherlands captain Peter Borren won the toss and elected to bat first against England, one of the contenders for the trophy. Netherlands started well, with openers Alex Kervezee and Wesley Barresi going at a quick pace but England fought back, getting both openers soon after; and after 33 overs, Netherlands were 149/4. Then Ryan ten Doeschate accelerated, and went on to score a brilliant century, and this, coupled with very poor fielding from England, helped Netherlands plunder 104 runs off the last ten overs and lead them to a strong 292/6.\nThe English started off very strongly in their reply, getting their first 100 runs at a run a ball without losing a wicket. Kevin Pietersen fell soon after, but Netherlands were unable to build on it. England captain Andrew Strauss closed in on a century but holed out and all the England top order batsmen scored runs, with Paul Collingwood and Ravi Bopara taking England home with 1.2 overs to spare.\nThe Netherlands score of 292 was the second highest score from an Associate nation playing against a Test nation.\nWest Indies vs South Africa.\nSouth Africa, another one of the pre-tournament favorites played their first match of the tournament against a West Indies team which is currently in transition. South Africa won the toss, set West Indies in to bat, and opened the bowling with spinner Johan Botha, which was vindicated as he got the wicket of Chris Gayle in the first over. Darren Bravo then came into the crease and played an aggressive knock of 73, with support from Devon Smith in a strong century stand until Botha trapped Bravo in front. Two quick wickets on debut by Imran Tahir left West Indies on 120/4 but a counterattack from Dwayne Bravo, who was well assisted by Shivnarine Chanderpaul took West Indies to a healthy 209/5 with over 7 overs left. However, Tahir returned to get the wickets of Chanderpaul and Devon Thomas, the other set batsman before Dale Steyn cleaned up the tail to restrict the West Indies to 222.\nSouth Africa stuttered at the start of their reply, with Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis falling cheaply early on. AB de Villiers then came into the crease and counterattacked with a string of boundaries, reaching his half-century at close to a run-a-ball. He and captain Graeme Smith had over a century partnership for the third wicket until Kieron Pollard got one through Smith's defences. This, however turned out to a false dawn for West Indies, as de Villers reached his century off 97 balls, and together with JP Duminy got the remaining 84 runs with over seven overs left.\nAB de Villiers century was the fastest by a South African in the World Cup and the South African victory was the 12th successive win against the West Indies.\nBangladesh vs Ireland.\nBangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan won the toss against Ireland and elected to bat, after conceding 370 against India after setting them in. His decision seemed to be vindicated at the start of Bangladesh's innings, with Tamim Iqbal unleashing a flurry of boundaries immediately, to take Bangladesh to 49/0 after 5 overs. Ireland needed a moment of inspiration and they got it from wicketkeeper Niall O'Brien who did a brilliant stumping to send Imrul Kayes on his way. Ireland quickly built on it, with a direct hit from Ed Joyce catching Junaid Siddiqui short, before both Tamim and Shakib were also dismissed softly. Mushfiqur Rahim and Raqibul Hasan staged a recovery then, and at 147/4 in the 34th over, Bangladesh looked well set for a score above 250 until Mushfiqur top-edged a sweep of George Dockrell. This triggered another collapse, and only a late cameo from Naeem Islam took Bangladesh to 205.\nIreland started off solidly in their reply, but then the Bangladesh spinners led by Shakib and Mohammad Ashraful took wickets at regular intervals. The match was evenly poised with Ireland 93/4 after 25 overs. Niall O'Brien was the key to the chase but with the score at 110, he was dismissed after a brilliant catch by Tamim Iqbal. Kevin O'Brien continued to fight, taking Ireland above 150 and giving them another sniff at victory till he holed out to deep square-leg off Shafiul Islam. A pumped-up Shafiul then ran through the tail, and Ireland were all out for 178, falling 27 runs short.\nShafiul Islam recorded the best figures for a Bangladeshi bowler in World Cup matches, with 4/21.\nIndia vs England.\nHaving scored 370 in their previous game, India elected to bat after winning the toss against England. Virender Sehwag, fresh from his 175 the previous game blazed away at the start of the innings, hitting a rapid 35 before falling to Tim Bresnan. Sachin Tendulkar then took over the innings, and was ably assisted by Gautam Gambhir. The duo continued at a very rapid pace and added 133 runs until Gambhir was bowled by Graeme Swann for 51. Tendulkar went on to get his hundred, his 47th in ODIs and fifth at World Cups, the most by anyone in the history of the tournament. When he was eventually dismissed for 120, India were strongly placed at 236/3 in the 39th over. Yuvraj Singh and MS Dhoni continued on at a brisk pace, with Yuvraj reaching his fifty off just 45 balls. India passed 300 in the 45th over, but then Yuvraj and Dhoni fell off consecutive balls to trigger a collapse. Bresnan took three wickets in four balls to get his five-for, his first in ODIs, and India did not bat their 50 overs, being all out for 338 with a ball left.\nEngland got off to a very strong start in their chase, with both Andrew Strauss and Kevin Pietersen going a rapid pace. Pietersen was dismissed for 31 in a freak way off Munaf Patel, but Strauss went on to get his fifty. Jonathan Trott was unable to convert a start, but Strauss and Ian Bell then indulged in a sensational stand of 170 runs for the third wicket. The duo also easily kept the required run rate well under control, keeping it around 7. Strauss reached his century off just 99 balls, and Bell took 45 to reach his half-century. England were 280/2 after 42 overs, when Zaheer Khan produced a sensational over, getting Bell caught at mid-off for 69 and catching Strauss plumb in front for a brilliant 158, his highest score in ODIs. Paul Collingwood and Matt Prior went cheaply, but some lusty blows from Bresnan and Swann kept England in the hunt, with 14 required off the last over. Swann managed 3 off the first 2 balls before Ajmal Shahzad hit a six off the third to leave England with just 5 from 3. A single and a two later meant that 2 was required off the last ball with all three results possible. Swann dug the last ball from Patel away for a single, which meant that the game was tied.\nWest Indies vs Netherlands.\nWest Indian bowler Kemar Roach took a hat-trick with the final three balls of the game and became the first West Indian player to take a hat-trick in a World Cup match.\nEngland vs Ireland.\nEngland batted first with Jonathan Trott making 92 from 92 balls. During his innings, Trott reached 1,000 runs in ODI cricket, from just 21 innings, equalling the record set by Viv Richards and teammate Kevin Pietersen. England finished on 327/8 from their 50 overs. In reply, Ireland lost their captain, William Porterfield with the very first ball, and were struggling at 111/5. Kevin O'Brien then made 100 in just 50 balls, the fastest century in World Cup history. Ireland chased down the 327 set by England, winning by three wickets. It was the largest successful run chase in World Cup history, until Pakistan surpassed this in 2023.\nSouth Africa vs Netherlands.\nAB de Villiers made his 11th ODI century, with 134 runs from 98 balls. His partnership of 221 runs with Hashim Amla is the highest ODI total in Mohali.\nBangladesh vs West Indies.\nBangladesh were bowled out for 58 runs, which was their lowest ODI score, and the fourth lowest score in World Cup matches. In reply, the West Indian opener Chris Gayle finished 37* and made his 8,000th ODI run.\nEngland vs South Africa.\nEngland batted first and lost the wickets of Andrew Strauss and Kevin Pietersen in the first over. Jonathan Trott and Ravi Bopara put on a partnership worth 99 runs, but England finished all out for 171, with four overs still remaining. In reply, South Africa reached 124 with the loss of just three wickets, but then lost the next four wickets inside five overs for three runs. Stuart Broad took the final two wickets, to give England victory by six runs.\nIndia vs Ireland.\nYuvraj Singh became the first player to score a 50 and take 5 wickets in a World Cup match.\nIndia vs Netherlands.\nDuring the match, Sachin Tendulkar became the first player to score more than 2,000 runs in World Cup cricket. Yuvraj Singh took his 100th ODI wicket, with the dismissal of Wesley Barresi.\nBangladesh vs England.\nBangladesh's score was at one point 169/8 but tail ender 58 run partnership brought victory for the team. Bangladesh's win in this match was only their second against England in a total of 15 ODIs.\nIndia vs South Africa.\nIndia won the toss and chose to bat. Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag put on 142 for the first wicket. India reached 267 before the next wicket fell. India then lost their next 8 wickets for 29 runs, to finish with a total 296 all out.\nIreland vs South Africa.\nAfter this victory, South Africa became the first team to qualify for the quarter-finals from Group B. Ireland were eliminated following this defeat.\nEngland vs West Indies.\nEngland had to win the game to have any realistic chance of going through to the quarter-finals, and 243 all out looked like a difficult score to defend, especially with the poor fielding that had plagued England throughout the tournament. However, the West Indies collapsed to 225 all out, after a spectacular run out by Matt Prior.\nBangladesh vs South Africa.\nThis was Bangladesh's second lowest score in the World Cup and the sixth in their ODI history. Bangladesh managed seven runs in the bowling Powerplay, the lowest in the tournament, trumping Kenya who had made nine runs against Sri Lanka. After this victory by South Africa, India and England are qualified for Quarter-finals from Group B.\nIndia vs West Indies.\nVirender Sehwag did not play due to knee problems."

        "title": "Ryan Mathews (American football)",
        "text": "Ryan Jefforey Mathews (born October 10, 1987) is an American former football running back. He played college football for the Fresno State Bulldogs, earning second-team All-American honors in 2009. Mathews was selected by the San Diego Chargers in the first round, 12th overall, in the 2010 NFL draft. He was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2011.\nEarly years.\nMathews was born in Riverside, California, to Tricia Mathews when she was 16. His father left before he was born and has only seen him a few times in his life. For the first four months of his life, Mathews and his mother lived out of her 1969 Oldsmobile. His mother is Caucasian and his father is African-American.\nAs a child, he and his mother moved to Tehachapi, a small city 35 miles southeast of Bakersfield, to be closer to family. Once there, she took on several jobs to provide a decent life for her son.\nHe began playing football at age five, and Tricia never missed a game.\nAfter junior high school, he moved to Bakersfield to face tougher athletic competition.\nHigh school career.\nMathews attended West High School in Bakersfield, California, where he played football and ran track. He played running back, quarterback, and linebacker for the Vikings football team. As a junior, he led West High to a CIF championship while rushing for 1,104 yards and 18 touchdowns on offense and totaling 97 tackles and 16 sacks on defense. Following the season, he was an All-State underclass selection. As a senior, Mathews led the nation with 3,396 rushing yards (9.97 yards per attempt) and 44 touchdowns as a running back, along with 851 passing yards and 11 touchdowns as a quarterback. After his senior season, he was named first team All-State and a second team All-American. In track &amp; field, Mathews competed in hurdles (personal-best of 15.99 in the 110m hurdles) and relays (43.13 in the 4 × 100 m). In addition, he also ran a 4.5-second 40-yard dash and had a 32-inch vertical.\nRegarded as a three-star recruit, many Pac-10 and Big 12 schools had interest in him, but backed away because of fears he would not be academically eligible. Fresno State remained in the recruiting scene and eventually Mathews signed with them. He was also teammates with CFL cornerback A. J. Jefferson.\nCollege career.\nMathews attended California State University, Fresno from 2007 to 2009. Mathews had his breakout game with 14 carries for 171 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns against Nevada. Later in the season, he had 16 carries for 144 rushing yard and two rushing touchdowns against San Jose State. As a freshman in 2007, Mathews rushed for 866 yards on 145 carries and scored 14 touchdowns. His rushing yard average and touchdowns led all NCAA freshmen.\nAs a sophomore in 2008, he ranked in the top 10 in the NCAA in rushing yards and touchdowns after four games. In the season opener against Rutgers, he had 26 carries for 163 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns. In the fourth game against UCLA, he ran for 166 yards and scored two touchdowns. After the injury, he missed most of the next three games and sat out the final five. He finished the season with 606 yards on 113 carries and eight touchdowns.\nIn Fresno State's third game in the 2009 season, Mathews had 19 carries for 234 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns against Boise State. In his next two games against Cincinnati and Hawaii, he went over 140 rushing yards and scored a touchdown against both. In the following game against San Jose State, he had 20 carries for 233 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown. In his next three games, against New Mexico State, Utah State, and Idaho, he totaled 157, 185, and 143 rushing yards. He scored seven total rushing touchdowns in the three-game stretch. On December 5, he had 32 carries for 173 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns against Illinois. In his final collegiate game, he had 31 carries for 144 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the New Mexico Bowl against Wyoming. As a junior in 2009, Mathews led college football in rushing with an average of 150.67 yards per game in 12 games. He totaled 1,808 yards on 276 carries and 19 touchdowns. He missed one game due to a concussion.\nFollowing the regular season, he was given numerous individual awards, including being named first team all-WAC and a second team All-American by CBS Sports, \"Sports Illustrated\", and the Associated Press.\nIn December 2009, Mathews decided to forgo his senior season and enter the 2010 NFL draft. His 1,808 yards rushing ranks him behind only LaDainian Tomlinson and George Jones in the WAC season record books.\nProfessional career.\n2010 NFL Draft.\nMathews was drafted by the San Diego Chargers in the first round with the 12th overall pick in the 2010 NFL draft. He is the third highest Fresno State Bulldog to be drafted since David Carr went first overall in the 2002 NFL draft and Trent Dilfer went sixth overall in the 1994 NFL draft.\nNate Cohn of \"The New York Times\" in 2022 listed Mathews and Anthony Barr as the only two of 19 top NFL draft picks since 2005 whose careers justified being chosen much earlier than their ESPN draft ranking.\nSan Diego Chargers.\nOn August 1, 2010, Mathews signed a five-year, $26.65 million contract with the Chargers. The deal included $15 million guaranteed.\nIn his NFL debut in Week 1, he had 20 carries for 78 rushing yards in the 21–14 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. In Week 17, he had 26 carries for 120 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns in the 33–28 victory over the Denver Broncos. As a rookie, Mathews finished with 158 carries for 678 rushing yards and seven rushing touchdowns. \nIn the 2011 season, Mathews had four games going over 100 rushing yards and two games with multiple rushing touchdowns. Mathews received praise for his improved play as a second-year running back. He finished with 1,091 rushing yards and six touchdowns and made the Pro Bowl as an alternate for Ray Rice.\nOn August 9, 2012, Mathews broke his right clavicle on his first carry in the first preseason game of 2012 against the Green Bay Packers. He was expected to be out for 4–6 weeks. On September 23, Mathews returned from his collarbone injury in Week 3 of the regular season. In the 27–3 loss to the Atlanta Falcons, Mathews made his season debut and rushed for 44 yards on 10 carries and caught five passes for 32 yards. However, he had a fumble inside the Falcons' 5-yard line. In the following game against Kansas City, Jackie Battle started instead of Mathews. Battle was in 27 plays compared to Mathews' 21, with most of Mathews work in the fourth quarter when San Diego's victory was mostly already decided. \"U-T San Diego\" wrote that Mathews would have been expected to start were it not for his fumble against Atlanta. On December 16 against the Carolina Panthers, Mathews broke his left clavicle and was placed on season-ending injured reserve for the remainder of the 2012 season. He finished the 2012 season with 184 carries for 707 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown to go along with 39 receptions for 252 receiving yards in 12 games.\nIn 2013, Mathews did not miss a game due to injury for the first time in his career. He led the NFL with six 100-yard games, and set a career-high in rushing yards with 1,255 that season; it was the most yards by a Charger since Tomlinson's 1,474 in 2007. Mathews led the NFL in both carries (121) and yards rushing (534) for the month of December, and ran for 100 yards in three of the final four games of the season. He fell short with 99 yards in a 26–13 win against the Oakland Raiders, when he also injured his left ankle. The following week in the regular season finale, he ran for a career-high 144 yards in a 27–24 overtime win over Kansas City that qualified San Diego for the playoffs. It was the Chargers' first postseason appearance since Mathews was drafted in 2010. The team won 27–10 in a win against the Cincinnati Bengals. Mathews had 52 yards on 13 carries, but ran the ball just once in the second half due to his injured ankle. It was the second consecutive week he was a limited practice participant on Friday before playing on Sunday. Still hurting, he started the following game in the against the Denver Broncos despite being unable to practice the entire week. However, he was limited to five carries and 26 yards and left the game in the second quarter in a 24–17 Chargers loss.\nMathews missed seven games in 2014 after he sustained a sprained MCL in Week 2 against the Seattle Seahawks. He had 12 carries for 105 rushing yards and a touchdown against the St. Louis Rams in Week 12. After suffering an ankle sprain in Week 14 against the New England Patriots, he missed the remainder of the regular season.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nMathews signed a three-year deal with the Philadelphia Eagles on March 12, 2015. However, the Eagles also signed NFL rushing champion DeMarco Murray and already had Darren Sproles, who scored six rushing touchdowns on limited carries in 2014. However, Murray played poorly in the first two games of the season against the Atlanta Falcons and Dallas Cowboys, rushing for 11 yards on 21 carries, although Mathews was not much better, rushing for four yards on four carries and one touchdown, while Sproles led the team with 46 yards on six carries. When Murray went down with a hamstring injury in week 3, Mathews stepped up against the 2–0 New York Jets and rushed for 108 yards on 24 carries while catching a 23-yard receiving touchdown. When Murray returned in Week 4, Mathews was again the backup, while Murray had another sub-par game against Washington. In Week 5, Murray rushed for 83 yards on 20 carries leading the team in rushing, but Mathews was only ten yards behind with only eight carries, and he also had a touchdown. Mathew's best performance was against the then undefeated Carolina Panthers, where he rushed for 97 yards on six carries. Mathews' chances of starting were damaged when he was knocked out with a concussion in a 20–19 loss to the Miami Dolphins, which led to Darren Sproles becoming the feature back. Upon his return, he played on an average level, but had a good game against the 11–2 Arizona Cardinals (11 carries for 58 yards) and finally won the starting job.

        "text": "John Patrick McCarthy (August 9, 1916 – May 12, 1998) was a professional football player in the National Football League (NFL). He graduated from Camden Catholic High School in 1935 and Saint Francis University in 1942, where he was named to the first-team of the Little College All-American Football Team for 1941.\nHe played in the National Football League for just one season in 1944. McCarthy played for \"Card-Pitt\", a team that was the result of a temporary merger between the Chicago Cardinals and the Pittsburgh Steelers. The teams' merger was a result of the manning shortages experienced league-wide due to World War II.\nMcCarthy was brought in as the team's quarterback after starter Coley McDonough was drafted into the United States Army just six days prior to the team's second game. During a game against the Green Bay Packers, McCarthy's 35 yard-per-punt average emboldened Card-Pitt to release Johnny Martin.\nAt the end of the season, the Card-Pitt passers completed just 31% of their attempts, with eight touchdowns and 41 interceptions (a record at the time, and still the third highest total in NFL history). McCarthy threw 13 of those interceptions, and did not throw any touchdown passes. His quarterback rating was 3.0.\nHe also was the punter for the Card-Pitt team averaging 33.4 yards for 24 punts.\nHe served in the Army Air Corp at the end of World War II.\nHe was a pitcher for a Canadian-American League farm team of the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball. He was a batting practice pitcher for the Phillies.\nHe became teacher of business and accounting and a basketball coach. Over the next 25 years at Camden Catholic High School, Gloucester Catholic High School, Gloucester High School, and Haddon Township High School in New Jersey his teams won more than 370 wins. His teams had 13 seasons with more than 20 wins and only one losing season. He was twice named South Jersey Coach of the Year. He was nicked named \"The Silver Fox\" because he was a wise strategist and he grayed prematurely in his 30s.\nHe was an assistant men's basketball coach at Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania under head coach Don Casey. during the 1973–1974; 1974-1975 and 1975–1976 seasons.\nIn his late 40s, he took up marathon running. He competed in an ultra marathon race of miles in Cooper River Park at age 62. He completed his last competitive race was at age 72. He suffered from Parkinson's disease and died at his home in the Westmont section of Haddon Township, New Jersey at age 81. He is buried in Calvary Cemetery, Cherry Hill, New Jersey."

        "text": "The NC State Wolfpack women's basketball team represents North Carolina State University in NCAA Division I women's basketball.\nHistory.\nThe early years (1974–1981).\nThe women's basketball team at NC State had its beginnings in 1974. Under first head coach Robert \"Peanut\" Doak, North Carolina State won the first game it played 57–45 over the Virginia Cavaliers on December 7, 1974, en route to an 11–4 final record.\nKay Yow, the former head coach of the Elon Phoenix, was hired July 1, 1975 as coordinator of women's athletics and women's basketball coach. Coach Yow began her legendary coaching career on December 6, 1975, and recorded her first win with the Wolfpack, a 68–64 triumph over the College of Charleston Cougars, on January 10, 1976. On January 27, 1976, the Wolfpack beat the North Carolina Tar Heels 68–58 in the first televised women's basketball game in North Carolina history. In her first season as the head coach, Kay Yow led her squad to the quarterfinals of the 1976 National Women's Invitation Tournament.\nThe 1977–78 season was a breakout year for the women's basketball program. On January 12, 1978, the Wolfpack beat the #1 Wayland Baptist Flying Queens 98–86 for its first ever win over a number one ranked team. In addition, the team won the inaugural ACC regular season championship and advanced to the Elite Eight of the AIAW Tournament where Wayland Baptist avenged its earlier season loss to the Wolfpack. NC State was ranked third in the final AP Poll of the 1977–78 season, its highest final ranking in school history.\nOn February 10, 1980, the Wolfpack won its first ACC tournament championship with an 85–75 victory over the Maryland Terrapins. NC State finished the season undefeated in conference play, capturing the ACC regular season title as well. The Wolfpack advanced to the second round, which was the Sweet 16, of the AIAW Tournament in both 1980 and 1981, foreshadowing the success NC State would later enjoy in the NCAA Tournament.\nA legend emerges (1981–2009).\nThe NCAA began sanctioning women's college basketball during the 1981–82 season, and on March 13, 1982, the Wolfpack defeated the Northwestern Wildcats 75–71 in its first NCAA Tournament game.

NC State defeated the Western Carolina Catamounts 137–65 in a record that still stands today. On January 12, 1991, #3 NC State lost a triple-overtime game 123–120 to #2 Virginia. The 243 total points scored is an ACC record.\nThe Wolfpack captured its fourth of five ACC tournament titles to date on March 4, 1991, by beating Clemson 84–61.\nNC State made its deepest NCAA tournament run in 1998. On March 23, the Wolfpack defeated the Connecticut Huskies 60–52 to earn a berth in the Final Four. On March 27, North Carolina State took the floor in Kansas City to take on the Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters, but the team ultimately fell 84–65.\nOn January 24, 1999, Coach Yow became the second coach to achieve 200 career ACC wins with NC State's 85–60 victory at Wake Forest. NC State retired the first set of women's basketball jerseys in school history on February 13, 2000. Genia Beasley, Trudi Lacey, Chasity Melvin, Linda Page, Andrea Stinson, Trena Trice, and Susan Yow each had her jersey retired.\nOn June 10, 2000, Coach Yow was one of 24 players and coaches inducted into the second class of the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame, and on September 27, 2002, Yow was enshrined into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.\nNine Wolfpack players, including Genia Beasley, Summer Erb, Trudi Lacey, Rhonda Mapp, Chasity Melvin, Linda Page, Andrea Stinson, Trena Trice and Susan Yow, were named to the ACC's 50th anniversary women's basketball team on September 25, 2002. The nine players were the second most of all ACC schools.\nCoach Yow recorded her 600th win at NC State on December 2, 2004, with a 65–36 win over the Seton Hall Pirates. On January 22, 2006, Coach Yow coached her 1,000th career game when NC State beat the Dartmouth Big Green 78–43. She was one of only four NCAA Division I basketball coaches to coach 1,000 games. On February 5, 2007, she became just the sixth coach in Division I women's basketball history to win 700 games with a 68–51 victory over the Florida State Seminoles. The Reynolds Coliseum floor was renamed \"Kay Yow Court\" on February 16, 2007. That night, the Wolfpack upset #2 North Carolina 72–65. On March 18, 2007, Yow recorded her 650th win at NC State with an 84–52 defeat of the Robert Morris Colonials.\nKay Yow died on January 24, 2009, after a 21-year battle with breast cancer. In her legendary career at NC State, she won almost 700 games, guided her teams to 20 NCAA tournaments, advanced to the Sweet 16 eleven times, and recorded 29 winning seasons.\nKellie Harper era (2009–2013).\nOn April 16, 2009, former Tennessee Lady Volunteers player and Western Carolina Catamounts head coach Kellie Harper was named the third head coach in NC State women's basketball history. Lady Volunteers head coach Pat Summitt said, \"North Carolina State is getting a young and rising star in the game in Coach Kellie Jolly Harper. I am proud for Kellie. I expect she will do a great job in a very competitive conference – she has what it takes to be successful.\"\nCoach Harper picked up her first win as the Wolfpack head coach on November 13, 2009, with an 87–71 win over the Florida International Golden Panthers.\nHarper was fired on March 25, 2013, after a 4-year record of 70–64.\nWes Moore era (2013–Present).\nWes Moore, head coach at University of Tennessee-Chattanooga, was named as the fourth head coach in program history on April 4, 2013.\nSince his hiring, Coach Moore has led a resurgence in Women's Basketball at NC State.\nIn his first season at NC State (2013–14), Moore led the Wolfpack to a 25–8 record, a fourth-place finish in the ACC standings, and an NCAA Tournament appearance. For his efforts, he was named the ESPNW ACC Coach of the Year. After an 18-15 campaign in 2014-15 and a 20–11 season in 2015–16, Moore led the Wolfpack to the NCAA Tournament Round of 32 in 2016–17 with an impressive 23–9 record (12-4 ACC). On March 1, 2017, he earned the official ACC Coach of the Year honor in votes by both the league's Blue Ribbon Panel and head coaches, earning the first such honor in the 43-year history of the NC State women's basketball program. He was also named a Naismith Women's College Coach of the Year Semifinalist after authoring upsets of four top-15 teams throughout the season: No. 2 Notre Dame, at No. 6 Florida State, No. 12 Duke, and at No. 7 Louisville.\nIn 2019 Coach Moore was the runner-up for the AP National Coach of the Year award.\nHis 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 teams make back-to-back trips to the Sweet Sixteen round of the NCAA Tournament. His 2019-2020 team won the Wolfpacks first ACC Tournament Championship since 1991 with senior point guard Aislinn Konig being named the tournament MVP.\nThe 2020-2021 team spent the entire regular season ranked inside the top 10, most of which was spent in the top 5, achieving a high rank of #2, matching a school record for highest ranking. On December 3, 2020, the #8 NCSU women beat the #1 ranked South Carolina team in Columbia with a final score of 54–46. The team was ranked #4 when they also beat the #1 ranked Louisville team in Louisville on February 1, 2020, by a score of 74–60. This was the first time a women's college basketball team has beaten a top ranked team twice in a season on the road. The team only experienced 2 losses in the regular season, both of which were away games which were later avenged with home wins. The team went into the conference tournament as the #2 seed and repeated as ACC Tournament Champions on March 7, 2021, beating the top seeded Louisville Cardinals 58–56. Junior Center Elissa Cunane was named the tournament MVP after averaging 23.3 points per game and 9.0 rebounds per game for the tournament. In their semifinal game against the #3 seeded Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, the team overcame a 10-point deficit in the 4th quarter to win by a final score of 66–61. For the 2021 NCAA tournament, the team earned the program's first ever #1 seed. The Wolfpack advanced to the Sweet Sixteen before falling to fourth-seed Indiana.\nIn 2021–22, the team improved upon their regular season rankings and spent the entire season ranked in the top 5. They began the season by losing to #1 ranked South Carolina on November 9, 2021, but they would later defeat #2 ranked Maryland on November 25, 2021 by eighteen points. They again reached the #2 national ranking, but could not eclipse South Carolina for the #1 spot. They finished the ACC season 17–1 and won their first regular season conference championship since 1990. They followed up that regular season performance by winning the ACC Tournament for the third time in a row. They were again a first seed in the 2022 NCAA tournament, defeating Longwood, Kansas State, and Notre Dame on the way to the Elite Eight. This was the programs' second Elite Eight appearance in its history. The Wolfpack couldn't overcome UConn and lost in double overtime to end their season. NC State was the only #1 seed to not qualify for the Final Four that year.\nIn 2022-23, NC State underperformed, going 20-12 overall and 9-9 in the ACC. They still made the NCAA Tournament, although they were upset by Princeton in the First Round.\nIn 2023-24, NC State made it to the ACC Tournament Championship, losing to Notre Dame.

        "title": "Bowling at the 1988 Summer Olympics",
        "text": "Bowling at the 1988 Summer Olympics was an exhibition sport for the first, and so far only time. In all, a total 24 Ten-pin bowling bowlers, 12 male and 12 female, from 21 nations competed in the exhibition, which was held on September 18 at the Seoul's Royal Bowling Center.\nPreparations.\nThe IOC Executive Board adopted bowling as an exhibition sport in January 1986, and the SLOOC created a bowling competition operation section in its secretariat in November 1987. The Bowling Operation was activated in March 1988. The organization hierarchy of the operation included the commissioner, secretary general, one director, two managers and nine officers. The operation headquarters moved its offices to the Royal Bowling Center (the venue), on June 24. It completed its staff of 137 shortly thereafter, including staff members of the SLOOC, volunteers, 91 support personnel, 55 specialized personnel and one temporary employee. A general rehearsal was held on September 9. The Royal Bowling Center, with 24 lanes (Brunswick20A-2), is located about 20 kilometers from the Olympic Village. No training site was designated separately. According to the specifications set for by the International Bowling Federation, 91 unit of 24 items, including 50 sets of pins, were secured to stage the competitions, while some implements used for the Seoul Asian Games were also used.\nCompetition.\nIn the morning were the preliminaries. 12 competitors each for the men's and women's events competed in an 11-game full league. In the afternoon were the finals. The first three placers in the full league contested for the first place under a ladder method of competition. Three members of the IBF officiated the competitions as referees. \nNo bowling professionals competed in the demonstration events. Carol Gianotti of Australia, a former multiple LPBA Champion, competed but did not win a medal.\nAll 1000 event tickets for the event were sold (only within South Korea).\nMen's event.\nKwon Jongryul of the Republic of Korea, who placed second in the preliminary, edged Singapore's Loke Chinto to capture the gold, and the third place went to Tapani Peltola of Finland.\nWomen's event.\nArianne Cerdena of the Philippines, who placed first in the preliminary, finished first again, followed by Asai Atsuko of Japan in second place, and Annikki Maattola of Finland in third place.\nAftermath.\nThe bowling industry lobbied unsuccessfully to get bowling recognized as a sport for future Games. It is not easy for young people in third-world countries to develop skill in bowling.\nMulti-national competition outside of the Olympics.\nAt the Americas-exclusive 1983 Pan American Games tenpins were a demonstration sport, with the tournament held in a similar manner to how it was held five years later, for similar demonstration purposes, at the 1988 Seoul Games. As a direct result of the 1983 experience in Caracas, Venezuela, for the first time anywhere, on August 2, 1991, in Havana, Cuba, the tenpin sport earned full \"medal status\" in an international multisport competition: the eleventh competition of the Pan American Games, at which all the nations of the Americas compete every four years. The medal-level competition has been held at every Pan American Games since then, and is a part of the 2019 Games to be held in Lima, Peru."

        "title": "John Ryan (rugby union coach)",
        "text": "John Ryan (29 September 1939 – 18 November 2022) was a Welsh rugby union player and coach. He took charge of the Welsh team for nine matches between 1988 and 1990 after the departure of Tony Gray. He resigned after his side suffered a record defeat, 34–6, at Twickenham in 1990, and was replaced by Ron Waldron.\nPlaying career.\nRyan learned rugby at Newport High School and was a good enough back row forward to play for the Welsh Secondary Schools in 1959. He joined Newport from school and played for the club until 1962. \nHe also played for Nottingham University and the UAU while studying for his degree before joining London Welsh. While playing at Old Deer Park he also represented Middlesex County as he pursued his career as a customs and excise officer.\nCoaching career.\nClub rugby.\nHe took over as coach at Rodney Parade in the 1973–74 season and stayed for five campaigns. After leaving the Black &amp; Ambers he joined their biggest rivals, Cardiff in 1979.\nHe was credited with bringing the good times back to Rodney Parade and famously plotted the club's first win in the WRU Challenge Cup final against Cardiff in 1977 at the National Ground. That season they also won the Whitbread Merit Table title.\nIn his first season in charge his side won 26 and drew three of their 48 games, while in the centenary season in 1975–76, they notched 29 wins and four draws in 51 regular season matches.\nThe centenary celebrations included fixtures against a WRU President's XV, the Barbarians and a World XV, as well as a 14–9 win over the touring Tongans. There was also a five-match unbeaten tour at the end of the campaign in the USA.\nThe win ratio rocketed in the 1975–76 season with 36 victories and a draw in 49 outings, although there was a 14–6 home defeat to the Wallabies.\nThe Cup winning campaign of 1967–77 improved to 34 wins and two draws in 42 matches. There was a return to the National Stadium in 1978, but no successful defence of their title as Newport fell to a 13–6 defeat to Swansea at the end of a season that featured 29 wins and 16 defeats.\n\"A true rugby man, 'Buck' as he was affectionally known in the rugby world, will be sadly missed. As we as coaching Newport and Cardiff, he also coached the Wales Sevens and the Wales senior side\", said Newport RFC president, Brian Jones.\nRyan switched to Cardiff in 1979 and helped the Blue &amp; Blacks to win five of their seven games in a pre-season tour to South Africa. They then went on to score a record 1,090 in a season that included 32 wins and a draw in their 46 regular season fixtures.\nThe 1980–81 season saw Cardiff entertain the All Blacks, going down to a 16–9 defeat, and their 32 wins over the season included a 14–6 triumph against Swansea in the WRU Challenge Cup final, making Ryan the first coach to win the cup with two different clubs.\nWales coach.\nHe stood down for personal reasons before the 1981–82 season, but was brought back by Wales to coach the U20 and U21 international sides. Then, in the wake of the heavy defeat suffered by Wales on their tour to New Zealand at the end of their Triple Crown campaign in 1988, he took over from Tony Gray as national coach in July that year.\nOn his appointment he said \"I like to keep a low profile\" but saw a number of leading players opt to turn professional with rugby league. Adrian Hadley was the first, then Jonathan Davies.\nOn his approach, he said: \"I think basics are very important. Also, fitness, commitment and team spirit. There’s no easy way to success – just hard work and dedication. My approach will be the same as it’s always been. My way will be to ensure the players set higher standards for themselves and the team. I’ll have to see they reach those standards and push them a bit further. There isn’t one consistent approach. Variation is the key\".\nHe brought former Wales captain Jeff Squire and Stan Addicott into the fold with him as assistant coaches and appointed Jonathan Davies as captain. His first game in charge was against Western Samoa in Cardiff on 12 November 1988 and Wales won 24–6.\nHis second game in charge saw Wales plummet to an ignominious 15–9 defeat to Romania. A home win over England in the final round of the 1989 Five Nations Championship saved Wales from a first whitewash in the tournament, a Mike Hall try and the boot of Paul Thorburn allowing Wales to win 12–9.\nIt was a tough time for Welsh rugby. The report on the New Zealand didn't make for good reading, Secretary Ray Williams stood down for personal reasons and there were only 40,000 fans combined at the games against Western Samoa and Romania.\nThe autumn clash with the All Blacks in 1989 turned out as another crushing win over the tourists, 34–9, and the 1990 Five Nations opened with a 29–19 home defeat. When Wales then fell to that record defeat at Twickenham in round two, Ryan had had enough.\nA few days later, he resigned and Ron Waldron was appointed to replace him. Ryan had been in the job for nine games and only 19 months.\nDeparture and later activity.\nDespite standing down as national coach, Ryan didn't walk away from the game he loved. He stood as a National Representative on the WRU Genral Committee and worked very hard to improve the structures that supported the National team and its coach in the future."

        "text": "George J. Digby (August 31, 1917 – May 2, 2014) was an American baseball scout and consultant in Major League Baseball.\nBiography.\nA native of New Orleans, Louisiana, Digby started his professional career in 1944. He was coaching high school baseball in his homeland when a Boston Red Sox executive came to sign his best pitcher, Dick Callahan. \nAfter that, Digby worked in the Boston organization for more than 60 years, half a century as a scout, 14 more as a consultant. Throughout the years, he traveled the South looking raw talent for the Red Sox. Among his finds were Red Sox graduates Tom Bolton, Steve Curry, Mike Greenwell, Jody Reed and Marc Sullivan. But Digby put great emphasis on signing future Hall of Famer Wade Boggs, after the Red Sox had reports that questioned Boggs' ability to be a Major League player, as he fought hard to convince the team that should draft the young man with the \"smooth\" swing. Finally, in 1976 Digby drafted Boggs in the seventh round and signed him for $7,500 and a college scholarship.\nIn 1948, one year after Jackie Robinson broke the baseball barrier in the Majors, the Birmingham Barons of the Southern Association were an affiliate team of the Red Sox who played at Rickwood Field in Alabama. The Barons, an all-white squad, shared the same field with the Birmingham Black Barons, an all-black team of the Negro leagues. At that time Digby spotted Willie Mays, by then a 17-year-old outfielder. Boston signed the Barons' player/manager Lorenzo ″Piper″ Davis for $15,000.\nDigby has served as role model, inspiration, catalyst and friend for many young scouts. The \"George Digby Award\" was created by the Red Sox in honour of Digby, to recognize annually the scout that has provided outstanding services for the organization. \nIn Digby was selected for induction into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame, becoming the first scout to gain the honors. Digby is also in the Florida Scouts Hall of Fame. He was inducted in 2000 and his plaque is near the press box at Tropicana Field. The plaque shows that he has signed 53 Major League players.\nDigby died on May 2, 2014, aged 96."

        "text": "The Royal Spanish Tennis Federation, officially known as \"Real Federación Española de Tenis\" (RFET) in Spanish is the national governing body of tennis in Spain. Established in 1907, the federation oversees the development, regulation, and promotion of tennis at both the amateur and professional levels throughout the country. The Royal Spanish Tennis Federation is a member of the regional association Tennis Europe and is recognized by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and the Spanish government as the authoritative body for tennis in Spain. The organization is also responsible for the Spanish Davis Cup team and the Spanish Fed Cup team. The federation headquarters lies in Barcelona.\nHistory.\nThe foundation of the Royal Spanish Tennis Federation can be traced back to the inception of the \"Royal Association of Spanish Lawn-Tennis,\" which originated from the roots of the \"Barcelona Lawn-tennis Association.\" This association held a distinguished position as the foremost national body affiliated with the London tennis association, a governing body that had significant influence over global tennis during the early 1900s. During that era, Spanish clubs lacked a centralized national authority to govern the sport’s regulations. It wasn't until the Concurso Internacional de San Sebastián in September 1909, a gathering that convened representatives from various clubs and enterprises, that the decision was made to establish a national federation. After undergoing numerous changes in nomenclature over the years, the federation adopted its current title, the Real Federación Española de Tenis (RFET), in 1975, solidifying its status as the principal governing body overseeing tennis in Spain.\nStructure.\nThe governance structure of the RFET comprises a president elected by member clubs and associations, along with a board of directors overseeing different committees dedicated to areas such as competitions, player development, officiation, and grassroots programs.\nRole and responsibilities.\nThe Royal Spanish Tennis Federation functions with the core objective of promoting, organizing, and overseeing tennis within Spain. Its role extends to representing the nation in international tennis competitions and holding memberships in both the European Tennis Association and the Spanish Olympic Committee. The numerous responsibilities the RFET is entrusted with include:\nNotable players.\nIn the last 30 years, the RFET has supported many players, aiding in the production of at least one World Number 1 (ATP ranking) every five years: Arancha Sánchez Vicario (1995), Carlos Moyá (1999), Juan Carlos Ferrero (2003), Rafael Nadal (2008, 2010, 2013, 2017 &amp; 2019), Garbiñe Muguruza (2017) and the youngest in tennis history, Carlos Alcaraz (2022) at 19 years old.\nAffiliations.\nThe Royal Spanish Tennis Federation collaborates with governmental bodies and other sports organizations to promote tennis and secure resources for the development of the sport. It also partners with educational institutions, local communities, and territorial federations to increase grassroots participation. To ensure its ability to function as intended, RFET has many sponsors that include, but are not limited to Orange, Mapfre, Iberdrola, Loterias y Apuestas del Estado, El Corte Inglés, Iberia, Kia, Head, Joma, TennisLife, Lednix and Indiba."

        "text": "John Lyons (born March 10, 1952) is a former American football head coach best known for his 13 years as head coach of Dartmouth College.\nLyons was an all-Ivy defensive back while playing for the University of Pennsylvania. After graduating in 1974 he worked as an assistant at Penn for the next 11 seasons, eventually riding up to become defensive coordinator. In 1988, he was brought to Dartmouth by then-coach Buddy Teevens. When Teevens moved on, Lyons was promoted to head coach in 1992.\nDuring his time as head coach, Lyons was successful during his first six seasons, winning two Ivy League titles and posting five winning seasons. The 1996 team won every game it played for a 10–0 record (with seven Ivy League games), becoming the first undefeated Dartmouth team since 1970. The ten wins also set a new record for most wins in a season (as with all Ivy League schools, they do not play bowl games). As of , it remains the last unbeaten Dartmouth team. He also coached future NFL quarterback Jay Fiedler. However, the program tailed off after 1997 and the school would finish in last place four times in the next seven years. His later years saw increasing criticism from fans and the local media as his decision-making was called into question. He was dismissed by the school after the 2004 season.\nAfter being fired by Dartmouth he coached in NFL Europe for the Cologne Centurions. He held the position from 2005 to 2007 and concurrently coached at Kimball Union Academy; he also was the school's athletic director, starting in 2008, and stayed in both jobs through 2010. In January 2011, he joined the University of New Hampshire's football program as its defensive coordinator and retired in 2021"

        "text": "John Lovett (born December 1, 1950) is an American football coach. He was the defensive backs coach for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL) from 2013–2014. He was the defensive coordinator for Maine in 1994, Auburn from 1999–2001, Clemson from 2002–2004, Bowling Green from 2005–2006, and Miami from 2009–2010.\nLovett has coached in nine bowl games: the 1997 Motor City Bowl, 1998 Independence Bowl, 2000 Citrus Bowl, 2001 Peach Bowl, 2002 Tangerine Bowl, 2004 Peach Bowl, 2008 Meineke Car Care Bowl, 2009 Champs Sports Bowl, the 2010 Sun Bowl, and the 2012 Meineke Car Care Bowl of Texas.\nPlaying career.\nLovett graduated from C.W. Post College in December 1973 and was inducted into the school's Hall of Fame in fall 2008. Joining the team as a walk-on linebacker, Lovett quickly earned a scholarship and served as the team's co-captain his senior season.

At the completion of his career, Lovett enrolled in graduate school at the University of Denver, earning his Master's Degree in 1975.\nCoaching career.\nEarly career.\nUpon graduation, Lovett began his career in coaching at Saint Joseph Regional High School in 1976. After two seasons as a prep school coach, he took his first collegiate coaching position as an assistant at Union College in 1978, where he was paid only $500 per year. In 1983, Lovett spent a season in the Ivy League at Brown University before moving back to New York to work under Joe Walton as the defensive quality control coach for the New York Jets of the National Football League in 1984.\nMaine and Cincinnati (Tim Murphy).\nThe following season, Lovett was hired by Buddy Teevens as the defensive coordinator and defensive backs coach for the University of Maine Black Bears. In 1987, Tim Murphy took over as head coach and the team went on to win the conference championship and qualified for the Division I-AA playoffs.\nWhen Murphy was hired as the new head coach of Cincinnati in 1989, Lovett joined him as the defensive coordinator for the Cincinnati Bearcats. He stayed at the school until 1993, when he was hired as the secondary coach for the UNLV Rebels.\nIn 1994, head coach Jack Cosgrove brought Lovett back to Maine to again serve as the school's defensive coordinator.

Four seasons later when Tuberville took the head coaching position at Auburn, Lovett followed him to the school, where he was named the defensive coordinator. Tuberville fired Lovett following the 2001 season.\nClemson.\nLovett was hired by Tommy Bowden to serve as the defensive coordinator at Clemson from 2002–04, where he helped develop one of the ACC's top defenses. In 2004, Clemson was 11th in the nation in pass defense efficiency (103.4) and 26th in total defense (327.3 yds/g). In 2003, his defense allowed just 19.2 points per game as Clemson finished the year with nine wins and a top 25 national ranking.\nBowling Green.\nLovett served as the defensive coordinator at Bowling Green from 2005–06. In addition to coordinating the defense at Bowling Green, Lovett coached linebackers in 2005 and defensive backs in 2006. In his first year with the Falcons, Lovett's defense ranked 20th in the country in turnover margin.\nNorth Carolina.\nLovett spent the 2007 and 2008 seasons as the special teams coordinator and a defensive assistant at North Carolina, where the kickoff coverage unit ranked among the nation's top 15 and the Tar Heels blocked six kicks in 2008. He coached the NCAA all-time leader in combined kick return yards in Brandon Tate, who also established the ACC career mark for kickoff return yards.\nMiami.\nOn February 12, 2009, Lovett was hired by coach Randy Shannon as the new defensive coordinator for the Miami Hurricanes.

He was the longtime (1978–1997) head baseball coach of the University of Nebraska, where his teams won a school-record 767 games.\nBiography.\nBorn in Grand Island, Nebraska, Sanders was a four-sport (baseball, basketball, football and track) star at Grand Island High School before he was signed to his first professional contract as an outfielder by Athletics scout Whitey Herzog. Sanders threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed .\nIn his rookie season (1964) in the Appalachian League, Sanders batted only 30 times, but collected 13 hits for a .433 batting average. He was then kept on Kansas City's Major League roster at the outset of the season under the terms of the bonus rules then in force. During that time, he appeared in his only Major League game, on April 13, 1965, as a pinch runner in an 11–4 loss to the Detroit Tigers. On May 4, 1965, the A's lost Sanders on waivers to the Boston Red Sox when they attempted to send him to the minor leagues for more seasoning. He played in the Red Sox, New York Mets and Kansas City Royals farm systems through 1968 before quitting the pro game. Overall, he batted .269 with ten home runs in 205 minor league games.\nSanders held both bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Northern Colorado. He first embarked on a coaching career in 1974 at a community college. After compiling a 34–15 mark at Arizona Western College in 1975–1976, he joined the Nebraska Cornhuskers as an assistant coach in 1977, and in 1978 was elevated to head coach by legendary Nebraska athletic director Bob Devaney. During Sanders' 20-year-long tenure, Nebraska had nine 40-victory seasons, made the NCAA Division I baseball tournament three times, and produced 92 professional players, including 1995 Major League Baseball first-round draft choice Darin Erstad and long time Texas Rangers first baseman Pete O'Brien.\nIn 1999, Sanders returned to professional baseball and the Red Sox organization, spending nine seasons with Boston as manager of their Rookie-level Gulf Coast Red Sox affiliate (1999–2002) and a scout based in Woodstock, Georgia (2003–2007). He then became a professional scout for the Los Angeles Dodgers, where he played an instrumental role in the August 25, 2012, trade that brought Josh Beckett, Adrián González and Carl Crawford from Boston to the Dodgers.\nSanders was named to the Nebraska Sports Hall of Fame in 2002. He died from cancer on February 3, 2022, at the age of 76."

Since 1981 he has served in a variety of coaching positions spread across many leagues, most recently as head coach for Füchse Duisburg in 2015–16.\nPlaying career.\nMcCutcheon played minor ice hockey in Toronto, and went to the 1962 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Toronto Shopsy's youth team. He was recruited to play at Cornell under Ned Harkness. In his junior season McCutcheon led his team in goals while the Big Red compiled the first (and thus far only) undefeated national championship in NCAA history. After graduating in 1971 McCutcheon embarked on a professional career. Despite going undrafted, McCutcheon was signed by the Detroit Red Wings. After scoring only 7 points in 45 games across three leagues in 1971-72 McCutcheon settled down with the Virginia Wings in the mid-1970s, eventually receiving a call-up to the parent club. While McCutcheon was a capable minor league player he couldn't adjust to the NHL level, recording only 4 points in 37 games over three seasons with the Wings. He spent the entire 1977-78 season in the CHL before heading overseas to finish his playing career with EC Graz.\nCoaching career.\nCollege.\nA year after hanging up his skates McCutcheon reappeared behind the bench at Elmira, a Division III program. Over six seasons with the Soaring Eagles McCutcheon saw a good amount of success, posting 5 winning records, and an appearance in the 1986 tournament. In 1987 he returned to his alma mater taking over as head coach from Lou Reycroft, becoming the second player from the 1970 team to coach the Big Red (Dick Bertrand being the first).\nMcCutcheon was tasked with rebuilding Cornell to its former glory after having declined over the previous ten years. The initial years were good, seeing the big Red post five consecutive winning seasons and making the tournament in 1991 but from 1992–93 on the team struggled and finished with three straight losing campaigns.\nProfessional.\nDespite the ending in Ithaca McCutcheon didn't stay idle for long, accepting a position as an assistant with the Los Angeles Ice Dogs for the 1995–96 season. The following year he became the head coach for the Columbus Chill of the ECHL, leading the team to its first division title and receiving the John Brophy Award for his efforts. As further recognition he was promoted to the AHL and coached the Rochester Americans to consecutive Calder Cup finals. McCutcheon eventually made his way back to the NHL, becoming an assistant with the Buffalo Sabres under Lindy Ruff. McCutcheon was named as an associate in 2006 but left the team five years later when his contract was not renewed. Since leaving the NHL McCutcheon has coached several teams in Europe in varying capacities."

        "text": "John Michael Newman (April 24, 1910 – April 17, 1967), commonly known as Johnny Newman, was a Canadian professional ice hockey player from Ottawa. He played 11 years of professional hockey, including eight years in the International Hockey League (IHL) and 9 games with the Detroit Falcons of the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1931. \nEarly years.\nNewman was born in 1910 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. He played junior hockey for the West End Beavers and was the leading scorer in Ottawa's City Junior Hockey League. After a game in which he scored four goals and added an assist, the \"Ottawa Citizen\" in February 1928 described him as \"one of the most brilliant performers in junior ranks.\" He also played at the junior level for Ottawa's City View team where he continued to earn a reputation as one of Ottawa's outstanding junior hockey players.\nProfessional hockey.\nDetroit Olympics.\nHe began his professional hockey career with the Detroit Olympics of the International Hockey League (IHL). He was recruited to Detroit by general manager Jack Adams during an August 1929 visit to Ottawa. He was then called up by the Olympics in November 1929. On November 17, 1929, in the first period of his first game with the Olympics, Newman scored his first professional goal and was described as \"a stocky little fellow [who] turned in a great exhibition of hook-checking and stick-handling than Detroit has seen in the minor ranks\" since Vic Ripley. In his first season, Newman appeared in 42 games and scored nine goals and added 11 assists.\nBy the start of his second season, and after \"playing the greatest game of his brief career\", including \"a smartly-executed solo effort\" in which he beat the whole Windsor team and scored on a back-hand from \"an angle which appeared impossible,\" he was branded as a \"star\" by the \"Detroit Free Press\".\nDetroit Falcons.\nIn mid-February 1931, Jack Adams promoted Newman from the Olympics to the Detroit Falcons (later renamed the Detroit Red Wings) of the National Hockey League (NHL). He appeared in nine games with the Falcons, scoring one goal with one assist. He scored his first and only NHL goal \"on a pretty backhand shot\" in a March 15, 1931, game against the Boston Bruins.\nReturn to minor leagues.\nHe was returned to the Olympics after his stint with the Falcons and continued with that club through the 1932–33 season. He scored a career-high 10 goals for the Olympics during the 1931-32 season.\nIn September 1933, the Red Wings traded Newman and two others Olympic players to the Buffalo Bisons in exchange for star defenseman Gamey Lederman. Newman continued to play several more seasons in the IHL with the Bisons (1933-34, 1934-1937) and Cleveland Falcons (1934-35). He appeared in a career-high 48 games with Buffalo during the 1935-36 season. He also spent part of the 1936-37 season with the Seattle Seahawks of the Pacific Coast Hockey League. He returned to Detroit in 1937, playing for the Detroit Pontiac Chiefs/McLeans of the Michigan-Ontario Hockey League from 1937 to 1940.\nOver the course of his 11 years in professional hockey, he scored 82 goals and contributed 85 assists for a total of 167 points.\nLater years.\nNewman was drafted into the United States Army in early 1941. He died in 1967 at age 56 in Hollywood, Florida."

        "title": "Algorithmic skeleton",
        "text": "In computing, algorithmic skeletons, or parallelism patterns, are a high-level parallel programming model for parallel and distributed computing.\nAlgorithmic skeletons take advantage of common programming patterns to hide the complexity of parallel and distributed applications. Starting from a basic set of patterns (skeletons), more complex patterns can be built by combining the basic ones.\nOverview.\nThe most outstanding feature of algorithmic skeletons, which differentiates them from other high-level parallel programming models, is that orchestration and synchronization of the parallel activities is implicitly defined by the skeleton patterns. Programmers do not have to specify the synchronizations between the application's sequential parts. This yields two implications. First, as the communication/data access patterns are known in advance, cost models can be applied to schedule skeletons programs. Second, that algorithmic skeleton programming reduces the number of errors when compared to traditional lower-level parallel programming models (Threads, MPI).\nExample program.\nThe following example is based on the Java Skandium library for parallel programming.\nThe objective is to implement an Algorithmic Skeleton-based parallel version of the QuickSort algorithm using the Divide and Conquer pattern. Notice that the high-level approach hides Thread management from the programmer.\n// 1. Define the skeleton program\nSkeleton&lt;Range, Range&gt; sort = new DaC&lt;Range, Range&gt;(\n new ShouldSplit(threshold, maxTimes),\n new SplitList(),\n new Sort(),\n new MergeList());\n// 2. Input parameters\nFuture&lt;Range&gt; future = sort.input(new Range(generate(...)));\n// 3. Do something else here.\n \n// 4. Block for the results\nRange result = future.get();\nThe functional codes in this example correspond to four types Condition, Split, Execute, and Merge.\npublic class ShouldSplit implements Condition&lt;Range&gt;{\n int threshold, maxTimes, times;\n public ShouldSplit(int threshold, int maxTimes){\n this.threshold = threshold;\n this.maxTimes = maxTimes;\n this.times = 0;\n \n @Override\n public synchronized boolean condition(Range r){\n return r.right - r.left &gt; threshold &amp;&amp;\n times++ &lt; this.maxTimes;\nThe ShouldSplit class implements the Condition interface. The function receives an input, Range r in this case, and returning true or false. In the context of the Divide and Conquer where this function will be used, this will decide whether a sub-array should be subdivided again or not.\nThe SplitList class implements the split interface, which in this case divides an (sub-)array into smaller sub-arrays. The class uses a helper function codice_1 which implements the well-known QuickSort pivot and swap scheme.\npublic class SplitList implements Split&lt;Range, Range&gt;{\n @Override\n public Range[] split(Range r){\n int i = partition(r.array, r.left, r.right);\n Range[] intervals = {new Range(r.array, r.left, i-1), \n new Range(r.array, i+1, r.right)};\n return intervals;\nThe Sort class implements and Execute interface, and is in charge of sorting the sub-array specified by codice_2. In this case we simply invoke Java's default (Arrays.sort) method for the given sub-array.\npublic class Sort implements Execute&lt;Range, Range&gt; {\n @Override\n public Range execute(Range r){\n if (r.right &lt;= r.left) return r;\n Arrays.sort(r.array, r.left, r.right+1);\n return r;\nFinally, once a set of sub-arrays are sorted we merge the sub-array parts into a bigger array with the MergeList class which implements a Merge interface.\npublic class MergeList implements Merge&lt;Range, Range&gt;{\n @Override\n public Range merge(Range[] r){\n Range result = new Range( r[0].array, r[0].left, r[1].right);\n return result;\nFrameworks and libraries.\nASSIST.\nASSIST is a programming environment which provides programmers with a structured coordination language. The coordination language can express parallel programs as an arbitrary graph of software modules. The module graph describes how a set of modules interact with each other using a set of typed data streams. The modules can be sequential or parallel. Sequential modules can be written in C, C++, or Fortran; and parallel modules are programmed with a special ASSIST parallel module (\"parmod\").\nAdHoc, a hierarchical and fault-tolerant Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) system is used to interconnect streams of data between processing elements by providing a repository with: get/put/remove/execute operations. Research around AdHoc has focused on transparency, scalability, and fault-tolerance of the data repository.\nWhile not a classical skeleton framework, in the sense that no skeletons are provided, ASSIST's generic \"parmod\" can be specialized into classical skeletons such as: \"farm\", \"map\", etc. ASSIST also supports autonomic control of \"parmods\", and can be subject to a performance contract by dynamically adapting the number of resources used.\nCO2P3S.\nCO2P3S (Correct Object-Oriented Pattern-based Parallel Programming System), is a pattern oriented development environment, which achieves parallelism using threads in Java.\nCO2P3S is concerned with the complete development process of a parallel application. Programmers interact through a programming GUI to choose a pattern and its configuration options. Then, programmers fill the hooks required for the pattern, and new code is generated as a framework in Java for the parallel execution of the application. The generated framework uses three levels, in descending order of abstraction: patterns layer, intermediate code layer, and native code layer. Thus, advanced programmers may intervene the generated code at multiple levels to tune the performance of their applications. The generated code is mostly type safe, using the types provided by the programmer which do not require extension of superclass, but fails to be completely type safe such as in the reduce(..., Object reducer) method in the mesh pattern.\nThe set of patterns supported in CO2P3S corresponds to method-sequence, distributor, mesh, and wavefront. Complex applications can be built by composing frameworks with their object references. Nevertheless, if no pattern is suitable, the MetaCO2P3S graphical tool addresses extensibility by allowing programmers to modify the pattern designs and introduce new patterns into CO2P3S.\nSupport for distributed memory architectures in CO2P3S was introduced in later. To use a distributed memory pattern, programmers must change the pattern's memory option from shared to distributed, and generate the new code. From the usage perspective, the distributed memory version of the code requires the management of remote exceptions.\nCalcium &amp; Skandium.\nCalcium is greatly inspired by Lithium and Muskel. As such, it provides algorithmic skeleton programming as a Java library. Both task and data parallel skeletons are fully nestable; and are instantiated via parametric skeleton objects, not inheritance.\nCalcium supports the execution of skeleton applications on top of the ProActive environment\nfor distributed cluster like infrastructure. Additionally, Calcium has three distinctive features for algorithmic skeleton programming. First, a performance tuning model which helps programmers identify code responsible for performance bugs. Second, a type system for nestable skeletons which is proven to guarantee subject reduction properties and is implemented using Java Generics. Third, a transparent algorithmic skeleton file access model, which enables skeletons for data intensive applications.\nSkandium is a complete re-implementation of Calcium for multi-core computing. Programs written on Skandium may take advantage of shared memory to simplify parallel programming.\nEden.\nEden is a parallel programming language for distributed memory environments, which extends Haskell. Processes are defined explicitly to achieve parallel programming, while their communications remain implicit. Processes communicate through unidirectional channels, which connect one writer to exactly one reader. Programmers only need to specify which data a processes depends on. Eden's process model provides direct control over process granularity, data distribution and communication topology.\nEden is not a skeleton language in the sense that skeletons are not provided as language constructs. Instead, skeletons are defined on top of Eden's lower-level process abstraction, supporting both task and data parallelism. So, contrary to most other approaches, Eden lets the skeletons be defined in the same language and at the same level, the skeleton instantiation is written: Eden itself. Because Eden is an extension of a functional language, Eden skeletons are higher order functions. Eden introduces the concept of implementation skeleton, which is an architecture independent scheme that describes a parallel implementation of an algorithmic skeleton.\neSkel.\nThe Edinburgh Skeleton Library (eSkel) is provided in C and runs on top of MPI. The first version of eSkel was described in, while a later version is presented in.\nIn, nesting-mode and interaction-mode for skeletons are defined. The nesting-mode can be either transient or persistent, while the interaction-mode can be either implicit or explicit. Transient nesting means that the nested skeleton is instantiated for each invocation and destroyed\nAfterwards, while persistent means that the skeleton is instantiated once and the same skeleton instance will be invoked throughout the application. Implicit interaction means that the flow of data between skeletons is completely defined by the skeleton composition, while explicit means that data can be generated or removed from the flow in a way not specified by the skeleton composition. For example, a skeleton that produces an output without ever receiving an input has explicit interaction.\nPerformance prediction for scheduling and resource mapping, mainly for pipe-lines, has been\nexplored by Benoit et al. They provided a performance model for each mapping,\nbased on process algebra, and determine the best scheduling strategy based on the results of the\nmodel.\nMore recent works have addressed the problem of adaptation on structured parallel programming, in particular for the pipe skeleton.\nFastFlow.\nFastFlow is a skeletal parallel programming framework specifically targeted to the development of streaming and data-parallel applications. Being initially developed to target multi-core platforms, it has been successively extended to target heterogeneous platforms composed of clusters of shared-memory platforms, possibly equipped with computing accelerators such as NVidia GPGPUs, Xeon Phi, Tilera TILE64. The main design philosophy of FastFlow is to provide application designers with key features for parallel programming (e.g. time-to-market, portability, efficiency and performance portability) via suitable parallel programming abstractions and a carefully designed run-time support. FastFlow is a general-purpose C++ programming framework for heterogeneous parallel platforms. Like other high-level programming frameworks, such as Intel TBB and OpenMP, it simplifies the design and engineering of portable parallel applications. However, it has a clear edge in terms of expressiveness and performance with respect to other parallel programming frameworks in specific application scenarios, including, inter alia: fine-grain parallelism on cache-coherent shared-memory platforms; streaming applications; coupled usage of multi-core and accelerators.\nIn other cases FastFlow is typically comparable to (and is some cases slightly faster than) state-of-the-art parallel programming frameworks such as Intel TBB, OpenMP, Cilk, etc.\nHDC.\nHigher-order Divide and Conquer (HDC) is a subset of the functional language Haskell. Functional programs are presented as polymorphic higher-order functions, which can be compiled into C/MPI, and linked with skeleton implementations. The language focus on divide and conquer paradigm, and starting from a general kind of divide and conquer skeleton, more specific cases with efficient implementations are derived. The specific cases correspond to: fixed recursion depth, constant recursion degree, multiple block recursion, elementwise operations, and correspondent communications\nHDC pays special attention to the subproblem's granularity and its relation with the number of\nAvailable processors. The total number of processors is a key parameter for the performance of the\nskeleton program as HDC strives to estimate an adequate assignment of processors for each part\nof the program. Thus, the performance of the application is strongly related with the estimated\nnumber of processors leading to either exceeding number of subproblems, or not enough parallelism\nto exploit available processors.\nHOC-SA.\nHOC-SA is an Globus Incubator project.\nHOC-SA stands for Higher-Order Components-Service Architecture.\nHigher-Order Components (HOCs) have the aim of simplifying\nGrid application development. \nThe objective of HOC-SA is to provide Globus users, who do not want to know about all the details of the Globus middleware (GRAM RSL documents, Web services and resource configuration etc.), with HOCs that provide a higher-level interface to the Grid than the core Globus Toolkit.\nHOCs are Grid-enabled skeletons, implemented as components on top of the Globus Toolkit, remotely accessibly via Web Services.\nJaSkel.\nJaSkel is a Java-based skeleton framework providing skeletons such as farm, pipe and heartbeat. Skeletons are specialized using inheritance. Programmers implement the abstract methods for each skeleton to provide their application specific code. Skeletons in JaSkel are provided in both sequential, concurrent and dynamic versions. For example, the concurrent farm can be used in shared memory environments (threads), but not in distributed environments (clusters) where\nthe distributed farm should be used. To change from one version to the other, programmers must\nchange their classes' signature to inherit from a different skeleton. The nesting of skeletons uses the basic Java Object class, and therefore no type system is enforced during the skeleton composition.\nThe distribution aspects of the computation are handled in JaSkel using AOP, more specifically\nthe AspectJ implementation. Thus, JaSkel can be deployed on both cluster and Grid like\ninfrastructures. Nevertheless, a drawback of the JaSkel approach is that the nesting of the skeleton strictly relates to the deployment infrastructure. Thus, a double nesting of farm yields a better performance than a single farm on hierarchical infrastructures. This defeats the purpose of using AOP to separate the distribution and functional concerns of the skeleton program.\nLithium &amp; Muskel.\nLithium and its successor Muskel are skeleton frameworks developed at University of Pisa, Italy. Both of them provide nestable skeletons to the programmer as Java libraries. The evaluation of a skeleton application follows a formal definition of operational semantics introduced by Aldinucci and Danelutto, which can handle both task and data parallelism. The semantics describe both functional and parallel behavior of the skeleton language using a labeled transition system. Additionally, several performance optimization are applied such as: skeleton rewriting techniques [18, 10], task lookahead, and server-to-server lazy binding.\nAt the implementation level, Lithium exploits macro-data flow to achieve parallelism. When the input stream receives a new parameter, the skeleton program is processed to obtain a macro-data flow graph. The nodes of the graph are macro-data flow instructions (MDFi) which represent the sequential pieces of code provided by the programmer. Tasks are used to group together several MDFi, and are consumed by idle processing elements from a task pool. When the computation of the graph is concluded, the result is placed into the output stream and thus delivered back to the user.\nMuskel also provides non-functional features such as Quality of Service (QoS); security between task pool and interpreters; and resource discovery, load balancing, and fault tolerance when interfaced with Java / Jini Parallel Framework (JJPF), a distributed execution framework. Muskel also provides support for combining structured with unstructured programming and recent research has addressed extensibility.\nMallba.\nMallba is a library for combinatorial optimizations supporting exact, heuristic and hybrid search strategies. Each strategy is implemented in Mallba as a generic skeleton which can be used by providing the required code. On the exact search algorithms Mallba provides branch-and-bound and dynamic-optimization skeletons. For local search heuristics Mallba supports: hill climbing, metropolis, simulated annealing, and tabu search; and also population based heuristics derived from evolutionary algorithms such as genetic algorithms, evolution strategy, and others (CHC). The hybrid skeletons combine strategies, such as: GASA, a mixture of genetic algorithm and\nsimulated annealing, and CHCCES which combines CHC and ES.\nThe skeletons are provided as a C++ library and are not nestable but type safe. A custom MPI abstraction layer is used, NetStream, which takes care of primitive data type marshalling, synchronization, etc. A skeleton may have multiple lower-level parallel implementations depending on the target architectures: sequential, LAN, and WAN. For example: centralized master-slave, distributed master-slave, etc.\nMallba also provides state variables which hold the state of the search skeleton. The state links the search with the environment, and can be accessed to inspect the evolution of the search and decide on future actions. For example, the state can be used to store the best solution found so far, or α, β values for branch and bound pruning.\nCompared with other frameworks, Mallba's usage of skeletons concepts is unique. Skeletons are provided as parametric search strategies rather than parametric parallelization patterns.\nMarrow.\nMarrow is a C++ algorithmic skeleton framework for the orchestration of OpenCL computations in, possibly heterogeneous, multi-GPU environments. It provides a set of both task and data-parallel skeletons that can be composed, through nesting, to build compound computations. The leaf nodes of the resulting composition trees represent the GPU computational kernels, while the remainder nodes denote the skeleton applied to the nested sub-tree. The framework takes upon itself the entire host-side orchestration required to correctly execute these trees in heterogeneous multi-GPU environments, including the proper ordering of the data-transfer and of the execution requests, and the communication required between the tree's nodes.\nAmong Marrow's most distinguishable features are a set of skeletons previously unavailable in the GPU context, such as Pipeline and Loop, and the skeleton nesting ability – a feature also new in this context. Moreover, the framework introduces optimizations that overlap communication and computation, hence masking the latency imposed by the PCIe bus.\nThe parallel execution of a Marrow composition tree by multiple GPUs follows a data-parallel decomposition strategy, that concurrently applies the entire computational tree to different partitions of the input dataset. Other than expressing which kernel parameters may be decomposed and, when required, defining how the partial results should be merged, the programmer is completely abstracted from the underlying multi-GPU architecture.\nMore information, as well as the source code, can be found at the Marrow website\nMuesli.\nThe Muenster Skeleton Library Muesli is a C++ template library which re-implements many of the ideas and concepts introduced in Skil, e.g. higher order functions, currying, and polymorphic types . It is built on top of MPI 1.2 and OpenMP 2.5 and supports, unlike many other skeleton libraries, both task and data parallel skeletons. Skeleton nesting (composition) is similar to the two tier approach of P3L, i.e. task parallel skeletons can be nested arbitrarily while data parallel skeletons cannot, but may be used at the leaves of a task parallel nesting tree. C++ templates are used to render skeletons polymorphic, but no type system is enforced. However, the library implements an automated serialization mechanism inspired by such that, in addition to the standard MPI data types, arbitrary user-defined data types can be used within the skeletons. The supported task parallel skeletons are Branch &amp; Bound, Divide &amp; Conquer, Farm, and Pipe, auxiliary skeletons are Filter, Final, and Initial. Data parallel skeletons, such as fold (reduce), map, permute, zip, and their variants are implemented as higher order member functions of a distributed data structure. Currently, Muesli supports distributed data structures for arrays, matrices, and sparse matrices.\nAs a unique feature, Muesli's data parallel skeletons automatically scale both on single- as well as on multi-core, multi-node cluster architectures. Here, scalability across nodes and cores is ensured by simultaneously using MPI and OpenMP, respectively. However, this feature is optional in the sense that a program written with Muesli still compiles and runs on a single-core, multi-node cluster computer without changes to the source code, i.e. backward compatibility is guaranteed. This is ensured by providing a very thin OpenMP abstraction layer such that the support of multi-core architectures can be switched on/off by simply providing/omitting the OpenMP compiler flag when compiling the program. By doing so, virtually no overhead is introduced at runtime.\nP3L, SkIE, SKElib.\nP3L (Pisa Parallel Programming Language) is a skeleton based coordination language. P3L provides skeleton constructs which are used to coordinate the parallel or sequential execution of C code. A compiler named Anacleto is provided for the language. Anacleto uses implementation templates to compile P3 L code into a target architecture. Thus, a skeleton can have several templates each optimized for a different architecture. A template implements a skeleton on a specific architecture and provides a parametric process graph with a performance model. The performance model can then be used to decide program transformations which can lead to performance optimizations.\nA P3L module corresponds to a properly defined skeleton construct with input and output streams, and other sub-modules or sequential C code. Modules can be nested using the two tier model, where the outer level is composed of task parallel skeletons, while data parallel skeletons may be used in the inner level [64]. Type verification is performed at the data flow level, when the programmer explicitly specifies the type of the input and output streams, and by specifying the flow of data between sub-modules.\nSkIE (Skeleton-based Integrated Environment) is quite similar to P3L, as it is also based on a coordination language, but provides advanced features such as debugging tools, performance analysis, visualization and graphical user interface. Instead of directly using the coordination language, programmers interact with a graphical tool, where parallel modules based on skeletons can be composed.\nSKELib builds upon the contributions of P3L and SkIE by inheriting, among others, the template system. It differs from them because a coordination language is no longer used, but instead skeletons are provided as a library in C, with performance similar as the one achieved in P3L. Contrary to Skil, another C like skeleton framework, type safety is not addressed in SKELib.\nPAS and EPAS.\nPAS (Parallel Architectural Skeletons) is a framework for skeleton programming developed in C++ and MPI. Programmers use an extension of C++ to write their skeleton applications1 . The code is then passed through a Perl script which expands the code to pure C++ where skeletons are specialized through inheritance.\nIn PAS, every skeleton has a Representative (Rep) object which must be provided by the programmer and is in charge of coordinating the skeleton's execution. Skeletons can be nested in a hierarchical fashion via the Rep objects. Besides the skeleton's execution, the Rep also explicitly manages the reception of data from the higher level skeleton, and the sending of data to the sub-skeletons. A parametrized communication/synchronization protocol is used to send and receive data between parent and sub-skeletons.\nAn extension of PAS labeled as SuperPas and later as EPAS addresses skeleton extensibility concerns. With the EPAS tool, new skeletons can be added to PAS. A Skeleton Description Language (SDL) is used to describe the skeleton pattern by specifying the topology with respect to a virtual processor grid. The SDL can then be compiled into native C++ code, which can be used as any other skeleton.\nSBASCO.\nSBASCO (Skeleton-BAsed Scientific COmponents) is a programming environment oriented towards efficient development of parallel and distributed numerical applications. SBASCO aims at integrating two programming models: skeletons and components with a custom composition language. An application view of a component provides a description of its interfaces (input and output type); while a configuration view provides, in addition, a description of the component's internal structure and processor layout. A component's internal structure can be defined using three skeletons: farm, pipe and multi-block.\nSBASCO's addresses domain decomposable applications through its multi-block skeleton. Domains are specified through arrays (mainly two dimensional), which are decomposed into sub-arrays with possible overlapping boundaries. The computation then takes place in an iterative BSP like fashion. The first stage consists of local computations, while the second stage performs boundary exchanges. A use case is presented for a reaction-diffusion problem in.\nTwo type of components are presented in. Scientific Components (SC) which provide the functional code; and Communication Aspect Components (CAC) which encapsulate non-functional behavior such as communication, distribution processor layout and replication. For example, SC components are connected to a CAC component which can act as a manager at runtime by dynamically re-mapping processors assigned to a SC. A use case showing improved performance when using CAC components is shown in.\nSCL.\nThe Structured Coordination Language (SCL) was one of the earliest skeleton programming languages. It provides a co-ordination language approach for skeleton programming over software components. SCL is considered a base language, and was designed to be integrated with a host language, for example Fortran or C, used for developing sequential software components. In SCL, skeletons are classified into three types: configuration, elementary and computation. Configuration skeletons abstract patterns for commonly used data structures such as distributed arrays (ParArray). Elementary skeletons correspond to data parallel skeletons such as map, scan, and fold. Computation skeletons which abstract the control flow and correspond mainly to task parallel skeletons such as farm, SPMD, and iterateUntil. The coordination language approach was used in conjunction with performance models for programming traditional parallel machines as well as parallel heterogeneous machines that have different multiple cores on each processing node.\nSkePU.\nSkePU SkePU is a skeleton programming framework for multicore CPUs and multi-GPU systems. It is a C++ template library with six data-parallel and one task-parallel skeletons, two container types, and support for execution on multi-GPU systems both with CUDA and OpenCL. Recently, support for hybrid execution, performance-aware dynamic scheduling and load balancing is developed in SkePU by implementing a backend for the StarPU runtime system. SkePU is being extended for GPU clusters.\nSKiPPER &amp; QUAFF.\nSKiPPER is a domain specific skeleton library for vision applications which provides skeletons in CAML, and thus relies on CAML for type safety. Skeletons are presented in two ways: declarative and operational. Declarative skeletons are directly used by programmers, while their operational versions provide an architecture specific target implementation. From the runtime environment, CAML skeleton specifications, and application specific functions (provided in C by the programmer), new C code is generated and compiled to run the application on the target architecture. One of the interesting things about SKiPPER is that the skeleton program can be executed sequentially for debugging.\nDifferent approaches have been explored in SKiPPER for writing operational skeletons: static data-flow graphs, parametric process networks, hierarchical task graphs, and tagged-token data-flow graphs.\nQUAFF is a more recent skeleton library written in C++ and MPI. QUAFF relies on template-based meta-programming techniques to reduce runtime overheads and perform skeleton expansions and optimizations at compilation time. Skeletons can be nested and sequential functions are stateful. Besides type checking, QUAFF takes advantage of C++ templates to generate, at\ncompilation time, new C/MPI code. QUAFF is based on the CSP-model, where the skeleton program is described as a process network and production rules (single, serial, par, join).\nSkeTo.\nThe SkeTo project is a C++ library which achieves parallelization using MPI. SkeTo is different from other skeleton libraries because instead of providing nestable parallelism patterns, SkeTo provides parallel skeletons for parallel data structures such as: lists, trees, and matrices. The data structures are typed using templates, and several parallel operations can be invoked on them. For example, the list structure provides parallel operations such as: map, reduce, scan, zip, shift, etc...\nAdditional research around SkeTo has also focused on optimizations strategies by transformation, and more recently domain specific optimizations. For example, SkeTo provides a fusion transformation which merges two successive function invocations into a single one, thus decreasing the function call overheads and avoiding the creation of intermediate data structures passed between functions.\nSkil.\nSkil is an imperative language for skeleton programming. Skeletons are not directly part of the language but are implemented with it. Skil uses a subset of C language which provides functional language like features such as higher order functions, curring and polymorphic types. When Skil is compiled, such features are eliminated and a regular C code is produced. Thus, Skil transforms polymorphic high order functions into monomorphic first order C functions. Skil does not support nestable composition of skeletons. Data parallelism is achieved using specific data parallel structures, for example to spread arrays among available processors. Filter skeletons can be used.\nSTAPL Skeleton Framework.\nIn STAPL Skeleton Framework skeletons are defined as parametric data flow graphs, letting them scale beyond 100,000 cores. In addition, this framework addresses composition of skeletons as point-to-point composition of their corresponding data flow graphs through the notion of ports, allowing new skeletons to be easily added to the framework. As a result, this framework eliminate the need for reimplementation and global synchronizations in composed skeletons. STAPL Skeleton Framework supports nested composition and can switch between parallel and sequential execution in each level of nesting. \nThis framework benefits from scalable implementation of STAPL parallel containers and can run skeletons on various containers including vectors, multidimensional arrays, and lists.\nT4P.\nT4P was one of the first systems introduced for skeleton programming. The system relied heavily on functional programming properties, and five skeletons were defined as higher order functions: Divide-and-Conquer, Farm, Map, Pipe and RaMP. A program could have more than one implementation, each using a combination of different skeletons. Furthermore, each skeleton could have different parallel implementations. A methodology based on functional program transformations guided by performance models of the skeletons was used to select the most appropriate skeleton to be used for the program as well as the most appropriate implementation of the skeleton."

        "title": "Jubilee Park Swimming Pool",
        "text": "Jubilee Park Swimming Pool, Woodhall Spa, Lincolnshire, England is an open air heated lido.\nHistory.\nJubilee Park was created for the benefit of the people of Woodhall Spa by Lady Weigall, who built nearby Petwood, now the famous hotel, as her country house. The park was opened in 1935 by Princess Marie Louise and named to mark the Jubilee of King George V. In its earliest days it was known as ‘The Royal Jubilee Park’.\nIn 1947 the whole park was gifted to the Urban District Council (UDC) and between 1947 and 1974 the UDC put considerable investment into the park and swimming pool and marketed it countywide. Jubilee Park was as synonymous with Woodhall Spa as the Kinema in the Woods and golf (now the home of the English Golf Union).\nFollowing local government re-organisation in 1974, the UDC eventually agreed to transfer the park to East Lindsey District Council (ELDC), who were keen to add it to their new property portfolio. Jubilee Park now comprises an open-air swimming pool (Lido), communal gardens, caravan site, tennis club and cricket club. The tennis club and cricket club have operated independently for many years under a leased agreement with ELDC. Some investment took place but over the next 30 years it became increasingly apparent that the park and its facilities would have trouble competing for funds with other, newer, leisure venues in the district.\nIn 2005 when the future of the pool, the café and consequently the park, were in serious doubt, it was not surprising that the community would unite to put pressure on ELDC to invest and save it. The same passions were aroused when it was proposed to close the park's caravan site, with people across the county signing petitions in the belief that not just the caravans, but the park itself was under threat. Woodhall Spa without Jubilee Park would not be Woodhall Spa, and Jubilee Park without the pool would not be Jubilee Park. Woodhall Spa is the acknowledged ‘Jewel in the Crown’ of East Lindsey. Jubilee Park is the ‘Jewel in the Crown’ of Woodhall Spa.\nTransfer of ownership of Jubilee Park to Woodhall Spa Parish Council took Place in April 2011. This transfer was accompanied by significant investment in ‘failing’ parts of the infrastructure – not least the swimming pool basin and the infrastructure of the caravan park. This injection of capital has secured the operational ability of the Park along with ensuring that key areas remain compliant with necessary legislative requirements.\nWith this operational ability secured, we now needed to secure the park's financial future under local ownership. The first four years were broadly successful although involving a steep learning curve.  It quickly became apparent, however, that the Parish Council wasn't set up in a way that could sustain Jubilee Park in the long term and a group of volunteers stepped up to look at possible ways forward.\nOn 2 May 2014, The Parish Council handed over the operation and management of the swimming pool, caravan site and communal gardens to Jubilee Park Woodhall Spa Ltd (JPWS) on a 99-year lease. JPWS took over from this point with the pool opening for the season the next day. The cricket and tennis clubs in the Park maintained separate leases.\nJPWS is a not-for-profit organisation set up as a company limited by guarantee (company number – 8912577). It is also a registered Charity (charity number 1159068).\nAs set in out in its Articles of Association, the objects of the charity are:\n1. To manage, promote and sustain Jubilee Park as a swimming, leisure, sports and recreation facility available for the benefit of the whole community, principally but not exclusively in the local government area of Woodhall Spa.\n2. To promote health and fitness in the community in particular but not exclusively through the provision of swimming, sports and health related training and coaching\n3. To promote, organise and facilitate co-operation and partnership between third sector statutory and other relevant bodies in the achievement of the above purposes.\nDescription.\nThe pool measures 33.3 m x 12.5 m.\nThe Park has a small cafe with open air facilities that is open in the summer season and for special events.  It serves both the public park and the swimming pool garden area and is run by a local family under a franchise agreement that has a number of years still to run.  The Trustees recognise the importance of this facility and there is scope for development. At this time, however, the provision of good sports/health related facilities is being given a higher priority.\nThe Park and its gardens are open to all throughout the year including the children's play area. The Park is popular for family picnics and available sports are bowls, tennis, croquet, cricket (for which there are independent clubs) and mini golf.  Parking is provided free.\nThe caravan/camping site has 73 touring pitches and up to 40 tenting pitches.  The site is full every weekend and during the school summer holidays. Historically the caravan/camping site has been critical in subsidising the running of the Pool and Park."

In 1934 they created the patented \"clincher\" softball, which was invented by Frederick S. deBeer, who was the founder's son, and who eventually was inducted in the Chicago 16\" Softball Hall of Fame . Fritz deBeer, Jr., Dick Pollak, Jim Muhlfelder, and Bob Campbell later joined the business and expanded to sports manufacturing. In the 1980s the baseball division was bought by Worth Inc. and Muhlfelder transformed deBeer into a lacrosse company. Using previous baseball experience, they created the first CU31, making lacrosse shafts lighter as well as stronger with the use of metal baseball bat technology.\nIn 2000, DeBeer began a line of women's lacrosse equipment. Their first stick, The Apex, was the first women's lacrosse head to legally have a pocket in their stick, which significantly changed the women's game."

        "text": "Lieutenant-Commander John Skinner Wilson (10 March 1884 – 31 May 1916) was a Trinidad-born rugby player, who represented , United Services RFC and London Scottish FC. He enrolled in the Royal Navy in 1898. He was killed in World War I in the Battle of Jutland, serving as Lieutenant-Commander aboard . He is remembered on panel 10 at the Plymouth Naval Memorial.\nEarly life.\nJohn Skinner Wilson was born on 10 March 1884 to Colonel Sir David Wilson and Nora Kate in Trinidad, where his father was subintendant of Crown Lands. From 1897 to 1904, his father was Governor and Commander in Chief of British Honduras. John had two brothers: the elder, Major Harry Stuart Wilson (born 1883), passed out of Sandhurst in 1902, and was killed in action on 9 September 1916 on the Western Front serving as Commanding Officer with the Royal Munster Fusiliers; his younger brother, Eric Ronald Wilson, survived the War as a captain in the Black Watch, and earned the Military Cross.\nWilson signed up as a navy officer cadet at Britannia Royal Naval College on 15 September 1898, and on 14 January 1900 was gazetted midshipman aboard , on which he served for three years. On 12 July 1904, he was promoted to sub-lieutenant, with seniority backdated to 10 March 1903; and on 5 January 1905, to lieutenant, backdated to 10 March 1904. He served in the submarines for six months, before joining , the flagship of Sir Arthur May. In 1906, he went to HMS \"Vernon\", where he undertook specialist torpedo training, and in the years running up to the First World War, he served aboard , , , , and finally, from 1913, .\nRugby career.\nWilson was a forward with a reputation for keeping busy and remaining close to the action. He played for United Services RFC, and was captain of the team in 1908 and 1909, considered to be his best years of rugby, according to E. H. D. Sewell. It was in 1908 that he earned his first cap for , against Ireland, on 29 February 1908. He was selected a second time for Scotland, to play against at Inverleith on 6 February 1909. Ahead of the game, the Welsh were 'quietly confident' of beating the home side. Wilson also played for the Navy against the Army 1907–1908 and again in 1913.\nOff the rugby field, he was also a good oarsman and sailor.\nFirst World War.\nWilson served aboard HMS \"Indefatigable\" from 1913. On 31 May 1916, the ship was engaged in the Battle of Jutland, and blew up and sank after coming under fire from . Only two survivors were rescued by the German torpedo boat S.68.\nWilson is commemorated on the Plymouth Naval Memorial, and, alongside his brother Harry, on the Chandler's Ford War Memorial."

        "title": "English National Cup (basketball)",
        "text": "The English National Cup is an annual basketball knock-out competition held between professional, semi-professional and amateur teams from the various divisions of the National Basketball League. For most of the competition's history, the draw has featured the elite of English basketball, but teams from the British Basketball League currently do not compete in the National Cup, as they compete in their own separate competition, the BBL Cup.\nThe final is usually played midway through the season, at a neutral venue. The winners of the tournament are awarded the George Williams Trophy, which is named for the man who donated the original cup.\nHistory.\nThe competition was originally launched as the A.B.B.A. National Championship in 1936, and was the first attempt by the Amateur Basketball Ball Association (A.B.B.A.) to develop an annual national basketball championship in England and Wales. The National Championship was initially structured as an end-of-season event to allow regional champions to compete against their peers from across England and Wales. It was governed by the Amateur Basket Ball Association (A.B.B.A.), a forerunner of the current Basketball England organisation. During World War II, the competition was put on hiatus; the last pre-war winners, Birmingham Athletic Institute, retained the trophy for the duration of the hostilities.\nFollowing the introduction of the National Basketball League (NBL) in 1972, the cup began a gradual decline in its influence on the English game as alternative national competitions became more established. The introduction of the NBL's own end-of-season playoffs in 1979 resulted in the competition being restructured into a season-long knockout tournament similar to football's FA Cup, with the competition renamed the National Cup to avoid confusion with the league championship. This structure continued through the introduction of the independent, franchise-based British Basketball League in 1987, though the cup was eventually truncated to a 16-team event for 1998 onwards, with the clubs holding a BBL franchise being joined by the top teams from the previous year's NBL Division 1 standings. This change in format came at the same time as the BBC began showing live coverage of the semi-finals and final.\nIn 2003, the governance and competition structure of basketball in England underwent a period of reinvention, which included rebranding the NBL as the English Basketball League and introducing new rules governing the use of import players across all Basketball England competitions. These changes led to conflict with the British Basketball League, which withdrew the support of all top-flight clubs and started their own breakaway competition. The withdrawal of the top-flight clubs led to the National Cup returning to a more open structure, with teams able to enter from all divisions of the NBL. This format largely remains to this day, with small variations in organisation during the early rounds.\nFormat.\nThe current competition structure is a knockout tournament with pairings drawn completely at random – there are no seeds, with the draw for all the rounds up to and including the quarter-final taking place in May. \nWhen there are an uneven number of clubs in the draw, some pre-selected teams will receive byes into the next round. In some seasons the number of entries has required a preliminary round. "

        "title": "2009–10 Texas A&amp;M Aggies men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2009–10 Texas A&amp;M Aggies men's basketball team represented Texas A&amp;M University in the 2009-10 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team was led by third-year head coach Mark Turgeon, who coached the team to a 24–10 record and an NCAA tournament appearance in the previous season. The Aggies play their home games in Reed Arena. The team was picked to finish fifth in the Big 12 in the preseason coaches' poll but finished tied for second. With their 22–8 regular-season finish and 11–5 mark in conference play, the Aggies participated in the 2010 Big 12 men's basketball tournament and defeated Nebraska before losing to No. 1 Kansas in the semifinals. They received an at–large bid to the 2010 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and earned a 5 seed in the South Region. They defeated 12 seed Utah State in the first round before falling to 4 seed Purdue in overtime in the second round to finish their season at 24–10. In the final Coaches' Poll, the Aggies were ranked No. 25.\nPre-season.\nNearly all of the contributors from the previous year's NCAA Tournament second-round team returned for the Aggies, including seniors Donald Sloan, Derrick Roland and Bryan Davis, along with juniors B.J. Holmes and Nathan Walkup and sophomores David Loubeau and Dash Harris. Despite that, the Aggies began the year unranked. A&amp;M faced a much tougher non-conference schedule than they had played in recent years, featuring a trip to Los Angeles for the 76 Classic. Among the other participants in the tournament were nationally ranked West Virginia, Butler, Minnesota and Clemson. Their other marquee matchup before the beginning of conference play was scheduled against the preseason-No. 14 Washington Huskies. Though the Aggies were not ranked in any major poll, they received votes in both the AP and Coaches' polls.\nDepartures.\nThe main factors contributing to A&amp;M's being unranked in the preseason were the departures of senior guard Josh Carter—the winningest player in Aggie basketball history—and junior post player Chinemelu Elonu, two of the team's starters the previous year. Carter graduated and signed a contract to play in Germany, while Elonu was drafted in the second round of the NBA draft. The loss of Elonu, who along with Bryan Davis constituted much of the Aggies' inside game, was tabbed as being especially detrimental to the team's hopes for success as the 2009-10 season began.\nRecruiting.\nIn 2008 the Aggies received commitments from four-star rated Naji Hibbert and three-star prospects Khris Middleton, Kourtney Roberson and Ray Turner. They later added Jeremy Adams to a class that narrowly missed being ranked in the top 25 classes nationally by ESPN. Roberson was later declared ineligible and, after waiting one year, will join the nationally ranked A&amp;M class of 2010. Turner was ineligible for the fall semester and joined the team in January, bringing an immediate impact. While Hibbert, who was the prize recruit of the class, contributed in many ways as a freshman, it was Middleton, called the best-shooting forward in the high school class of 2009 by many, who later became a starter and threw his name into the ring as a potential future star for the Aggies.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9| Exhibition\n!colspan=9| Regular season\n!colspan=10| 2010 Big 12 men's basketball tournament\n!colspan=10| 2010 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament\nDerrick Roland.\nOn December 22, 2009, senior guard Derrick Roland broke the tibia and fibula in his right leg early in the second half of the Aggies' game against Washington. After going up for a rebound, he came down awkwardly, his leg emitting a loud crack that was heard throughout the arena. The leg bent outwards at a ninety-degree angle in the middle of his shin. Many of the Aggies began crying on the court at the sight, including Roland's childhood friend, senior guard Donald Sloan, who had to be helped off of the court. Pondexter called it \"One of the nastiest things I've ever seen.\" Turgeon said, \"Derrick was the heart and soul of this team. Everyone is devastated. Our guys had their eyes swollen in the last five minutes of the game. They were crying during the game. They never came out of it.\" The Aggies, who were shaken, stumbled to a 73-64 defeat. After the loss, the previously No. 19 Aggies (in the AP poll) dropped out of the rankings and did not re-enter until February 15, 2010. Roland was treated in a Seattle-area hospital before returning to Texas. At the time of his injury, he was averaging 11.1 points per game, second on the team, and had been named to the All-Big 12 Defensive Team the year before. Roland's injury significantly altered the course and prospects of the Aggies' season.\nIn A&amp;M's conference play-opening win against Nebraska, Roland returned to the team bench on crutches and watched his teammates play in person for the first time since his injury. Despite missing one of their team captains, their best defender and a viable scoring option—or perhaps using it as motivation—the Aggies continued on to a 22-8 regular-season record and an 11-5 conference record, tied for second in the Big 12. The team became a mainstay in the top 15 of the RPI and ranked in both the AP and Coaches' polls for the entirety of the second half of the season. Roland's quick progression in his recovery led to rumors that he may have been able to return to the team, able to play, in time for the Big 12 tournament or the NCAA tournament, but Texas A&amp;M was reluctant to feed speculation regarding the possibilities and no situation in which he could enter a game ever materialized.\nOn March 3, 2010, Roland was honored along with fellow seniors Donald Sloan and Bryan Davis at the Aggies' Senior Night before and after Texas A&amp;M's win against Oklahoma State in their last home game of the season. The Aggies' season ended in the second round of the 2010 NCAA Tournament with a loss to fourth-seeded Purdue, and it was announced that coach Mark Turgeon would help Roland pursue a medical redshirt in order to return to the team for the 2010-11 season.\n\"He's always thought about it, but the thing about it is there is no guarantee,\" Turgeon said. \"Let's just say we're going to try to get him a redshirt year. I'm not going to sit here and fight it in the media. It's something we are going to try. He wants to try but we are fighting an uphill battle on this one.\""

        "title": "Basketball Association of America",
        "text": "The Basketball Association of America (BAA) was a professional basketball league in North America, founded in 1946. Following its third season, 1948–49, the BAA absorbed most of National Basketball League (NBL) and rebranded as the National Basketball Association (NBA).\nThe Philadelphia Warriors won the inaugural BAA championship in 1947, followed by the Baltimore Bullets and the Minneapolis Lakers in 1948 and 1949, respectively. Six teams from the BAA remain in operation in the NBA as of the 2021–22 season, three that co-founded the league in 1946 and three that joined it from the NBL in 1948 (below). The inaugural BAA season began with 11 teams, of which four dropped out before the second season. One ABL team joined to provide 8 teams for 1947–48 and four NBL teams joined to provide 12 for 1948–49. The records and statistics of the BAA and NBL prior to the merger in 1949 are considered in official NBA history only if a player, coach or team participated in the newly formed NBA after 1949 for one or more seasons.\nThe NBA generally claims the BAA's history as its own. For example, at \"NBA History\" online its table of one-line \"NBA Season Recaps\" begins 1946–47 without comment. It celebrated \"NBA at 50\" in 1996, with the announcement of its 50 Greatest Players among other things.\nHistory.\nWhen the BAA was founded there were two established professional leagues in the United States: the American Basketball League (ABL) in the East, founded 1925, and the National Basketball League (NBL) in Midwestern industrial cities, founded 1937. However, most of the ABL and NBL teams played in small arenas, and in some cases even ballrooms or high school gymnasiums. Walter Brown, owner of the Boston Garden, believed that major ice hockey arenas, which sat empty on many nights, could be put to profitable use hosting basketball games when there were no ice hockey games to be played. To put this theory into practice, the BAA was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, The remaining founding members were represented by the Madison Square Garden sports promoter Ned Irish, Philadelphia Arena sports promoter Peter Tyrell, the Uline Arena owner Mike Uline, both Chicago Stadium and St.Louis Arena owner Arthur Wirtz, the Detroit Olympia owner James D. Norris, the Cleveland Arena sports promoter Albert Sutphin, the Maple Leaf Gardens managing Director Frank Selke, Duquesne Gardens entertainment executive John Harris and Rhode Island Auditorium owner Louis Pieri. The already serving president of the American Hockey League (AHL) Maurice Podoloff was appointed president of the BAA, becoming the first person to simultaneously lead two professional leagues—Joseph Carr had been president of the ABL from 1925 to 1928 while also overseeing the National Football League (NFL), although the NFL and ABL seasons did not overlap.\nThe owners of the BAA, while experienced businessmen, had little experience owning basketball teams. The league started with 11 teams, which played a 60-game regular season. This was followed by the playoffs and the final series to determine the league winner.\nAlthough there had been earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues, including the American Basketball League (ABL) and the NBL, the BAA was the first league that attempted to play primarily in large arenas in major cities, such as Madison Square Garden and Boston Garden. At its inception, the quality of play in the BAA was not significantly better than in competing leagues, or among leading independent clubs such as the Harlem Globetrotters. For instance, both the 1948 and 1949 titles were won by teams that had played in other leagues during the previous year, the Baltimore Bullets in 1948 and the Minneapolis Lakers in 1949.\n1946–47 season.\nThe league started with 11 teams, which were divided into two divisions, the Eastern Division and the Western Division. Each team played 60 or 61 regular season games. The best three teams from each division advanced to the playoffs. The two division winners received first-round byes and qualified directly to the semifinals, while the two second-place teams and two third-place teams competed in the best-of-3 quarterfinals, followed by the semifinals. The final series was also played in a best-of-7 format.\nOn November 1, 1946, at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers, which the NBA now regards as the league's first official game. In the opening game of the BAA, Ossie Schectman scored the opening basket for the Knickerbockers. The Eastern Division winner, the Washington Capitols, who had the best record with 49 wins, were defeated in the best-of-7 semifinal by the Western Division winner, the Chicago Stags. The Stags advanced to the finals along with the Philadelphia Warriors who defeated the New York Knickerbockers in the other semifinal. The Warriors won the inaugural BAA championship by winning the series 4–1.\nThe first year had many problems. In arenas shared with hockey teams, some arena owners simply put a wooden basketball floor over the ice. This caused some games to be cancelled due to puddles on the floor. In addition, some owners would not heat their buildings, leading fans to bring blankets to the games and players to wear gloves. Attendance averaged just 3,000 per game. Teams with large leads would stall by having players dribble the ball for long periods. The owners discussed trying a 60-minute game and even doing \"innings\" where each team would have the ball for a certain period of time. In addition, the teams in the league were financially weak. However, the BAA still had fans eager to see former college stars play.\nFrom the beginning, the league aspired to be a major league. The league also differed from its rival, the NBL. The BAA played a 48-minute game instead of a 40-minute game, and allowed players to play until they committed six fouls as opposed to five. The league formation did not alarm team owners in the NBL until some NBL players switched to the BAA.\n1947–48 season.\nBefore the season started, the Cleveland Rebels, Detroit Falcons, Pittsburgh Ironmen and Toronto Huskies folded, leaving the BAA with only seven teams. The Baltimore Bullets joined the league from the ABL, and were assigned to the Western Division along with the Washington Capitols to even the divisions. Prior to the start of the season, the league held its inaugural college draft on July 1, 1947. Each team played 48 regular season games. The Eastern Division was won by the Philadelphia Warriors, the West by the St. Louis Bombers.\nThe 1948 Playoffs followed the same format as the previous year. The Eastern Division winner, the Philadelphia Warriors defeated the Western Division winner, St. Louis Bombers. In the finals, the Warriors were defeated by the Bullets 4–2.\n1948–49 season.\nPrior to the start of the season, four teams from the NBL, the Fort Wayne Pistons, Indianapolis Jets, Minneapolis Lakers and the Rochester Royals, joined the BAA. This caused a surge in talent as players such as George Mikan were now playing in the BAA. With twelve teams, the league was realigned into two six-team divisions. Each team played 60 regular season games. The Eastern Division was won by the Washington Capitols who had 38 wins, while the Western Division was dominated by the two new teams, the Royals and the Lakers who had 45 and 44 wins respectively.\nThe 1949 Playoffs were expanded to include eight teams. The four best teams from each division contested in divisional semifinals and divisional finals to find each division winners. The two division winners then advanced to the finals. The divisional semifinals and finals were played in a best-of-3 format while the final series were played in the best-of-7 format. The Lakers defeated the Royals to become the inaugural Western Division winner. In the other divisional final, the Capitols defeated the New York Knicks to become the inaugural Eastern Division winner. The Lakers then won the finals by defeating the Capitols 4–2.\nAbsorption of NBL, and rebranding as NBA.\nOn August 3, 1949, the BAA agreed to merge with the NBL, creating the National Basketball Association (NBA). Six remaining NBL teams joined with the ten BAA teams; the Indianapolis Jets and the Providence Steamrollers folded prior to the absorption. The Indianapolis Olympians, a planned expansion team for the NBL, also joined the newly formed league. In total, the new league had 17 teams located in a mix of large and small cities, as well as large arenas, smaller gymnasiums, and armories. Prior to the merge, the league held the 1949 college draft on March 21, which was the last event held under the name BAA.\nThe NBA claims the BAA's history as its own. It reckons the 1949 deal as an expansion, not a merger, and does not recognize NBL records.\nLeague championships.\nThe series was initially known as the BAA Finals prior to the 1949–50 season when the Basketball Association of America (BAA) absorbed the National Basketball League (NBL) and rebranded as NBA.\nAwards.\nThe All-BAA Team was an annual BAA honor bestowed on the best players in the league following every season. The All-BAA Team was composed of two five-man lineups—a first and second team, comprising a total of 10 roster spots. The players were selected without regard to position."

        "title": "Tim Thomas (basketball)",
        "text": "Timothy Mark Thomas (born February 26, 1977) is an American basketball coach and former professional player. He was a highly ranked prospect while playing at Paterson Catholic High School in his hometown of Paterson, New Jersey. Thomas played college basketball for the Villanova Wildcats and declared for the 1997 NBA draft after his freshman season. He spent thirteen seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Philadelphia 76ers, Milwaukee Bucks, New York Knicks, Chicago Bulls, Phoenix Suns, Los Angeles Clippers and Dallas Mavericks. Thomas serves as the head coach of the boys basketball team at Paramus Catholic High School in Paramus, New Jersey.\nHigh school.\nA versatile forward with a soft shooting touch, Thomas was tabbed as a future NBA star when he was still in high school, and was selected to the McDonald's All-American team after averaging 25.3 points and 14.5 rebounds per game as a senior at Paterson Catholic High School. He was ranked as the no. 2 recruit in the nation behind only Kobe Bryant whom almost joined him at Villanova after the two both played in the 1996 High School McDonald's All-American game, the All-Star Magic Johnson Roundball Classic game, as well as AAU which they dominated together. Thomas considered making the jump straight to the NBA from high school, waiting to declare his decision to attend college at Villanova until just days before the deadline to enter the NBA draft.\nCollege career.\nThomas made his mark in his one season of college basketball at Villanova University. Joining a future NBA talent-laden team with Alvin Williams, Jason Lawson, John Celestand and Malik Allen, he filled the void of former Big East Player of the Year Kerry Kittles from the year before and helped lead the Wildcats to a Big East regular season title under head coach Steve Lappas. Villanova took second place in the Big East tournament, while Thomas was named to both All-Big East and All-Big East Tournament teams as well as win Big East Rookie of the Year award while averaging 17 points and 6 rebounds per game. Villanova would make the 1997 NCAA tournament but lost in second round to California, which featured future NFL Hall of Famer Tony Gonzalez.\nNBA career.\nFollowing his freshman year at Villanova, he was drafted seventh overall by the New Jersey Nets in the 1997 NBA draft and was immediately traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for the 76ers' draft pick (Keith Van Horn).\nPhiladelphia 76ers.\nThomas enjoyed a solid rookie season, averaging 11 points per game, and was named to the NBA's All-Rookie Second Team. On February 14, 1998, in possibly the best game of his rookie season, Thomas scored 27 points and grabbed 6 rebounds in a loss against the Nets. The 76ers would grow impatient with a sophomore slump from Thomas, though, and in 1999 he and Scott Williams were traded to the Milwaukee Bucks for Jerald Honeycutt and Tyrone Hill.\nMilwaukee Bucks.\nMilwaukee was enamored with Thomas's raw talent and versatility, and hoped he could blossom into a star with more seasoning. On May 13, 1999, in the deciding game of Milwaukee's first round series versus the Indiana Pacers, Thomas scored 12 points and grabbed 5 rebounds in a 99-91 loss. On March 2, 2000, Thomas scored 26 points and grabbed 5 rebounds in a loss against the Knicks. During the 2000–01 season, he averaged a career-high 13.4 ppg for the Bucks. On January 5, 2001, Thomas connected on eight three-point field goals in the second half of Milwaukee's 119–115 loss to Portland in which he finished with a career-high 39 points.\nDuring that year's postseason, on April 28, Thomas scored 18 points and grabbed 7 rebounds in a Game 4 win against Tracy McGrady and the Orlando Magic. The Bucks would ultimately come up short against that season's MVP, Allen Iverson, in a tightly contested Eastern Conference Finals against the 76ers, Thomas' former team. Nevertheless, after a strong playoff performance that year, Thomas signed a new deal with the Bucks worth roughly $66 million over six years, despite being offered more money by Chicago. Upon signing the deal, Bucks owner Herb Kohl said \"Tim is a very vital part of this team, and we were willing to take any steps we needed to keep him in town.″\nOn January 11, 2002, Thomas scored 25 points and grabbed 6 rebounds in a 105-86 win against the Washington Wizards. Four days later, Thomas again scored 25 points, this time in a 106-102 win over the Indiana Pacers. The Bucks would miss that season's playoffs, their first postseason miss during Thomas' tenure.\nOn December 9, 2002, Thomas scored 22 points and grabbed 9 rebounds in a 140-133 double overtime win against the Cleveland Cavaliers. On April 19, 2003, Thomas scored a playoff career-high 25 points in a Game 1 loss versus the New Jersey Nets. The Bucks would go on to lose the series in 6 games.\nDuring his time with the Bucks, then-teammate Ray Allen was quoted as saying, \"If he wanted to, Tim Thomas could be the best player in the league.\" While on the Bucks, Thomas was known to wear a customized version of his own jersey that said \"Notorious T.I.M.\" on the back while making public appearances at events.\nNew York Knicks.\nOn February 16, 2004, Thomas was traded to the New York Knicks in a three-team trade that also included the Atlanta Hawks. The trade also sent Keith Van Horn, whom Thomas was also traded for during the 1997 draft, from the Knicks to the Bucks, Nazr Mohammed from the Hawks to the Knicks, Joel Przybilla from the Bucks to the Hawks, and Michael Doleac from the Knicks to the Hawks.\nDuring game 1 of the Knicks' first-round playoff series against the Nets, Thomas suffered an injury that kept him out of the remainder of the playoffs, when he was fouled by Jason Collins and taken out of the game on a stretcher. The incident started a long feud with Nets forward Kenyon Martin, who Thomas called a fake tough guy, that continued past both players' playing careers.\nIn 2017, Thomas rehashed their feud on an episode of the Scoop B Radio Podcast. Thomas told Brandon Scoop B Robinson that he'd like to settle his feud with Martin once and for all with a boxing match. The proceeds would go to the charity of their choice. Martin declined.\nChicago Bulls.\nPrior to the 2005–06 season, Thomas was traded to the Chicago Bulls, along with Jermaine Jackson, Mike Sweetney, a 2006 1st-round draft pick, a 2007 1st-round draft pick, a 2007 2nd-round draft pick and a 2009 2nd-round draft pick, in exchange for Eddy Curry, Antonio Davis and a 2007 1st-round draft pick.\nPlaying in the final year of his contract, Thomas was given minimal minutes from the rebuilding Bulls. After playing just three games for Chicago, Thomas was deactivated while dealing with ankle and back injuries. After not playing for nearly four months, Thomas was granted his release from the Bulls.\nPhoenix Suns.\nOn March 1, 2006, Thomas agreed to terms with the Phoenix Suns to a contract for the remainder of the season. He made his debut with the Suns two days later, scoring 20 points off the bench in a 123–118 win over Orlando. Playing alongside reigning NBA MVP Steve Nash (who won a consecutive MVP award that year), Thomas rejuvenated his career in Phoenix.\nIn the playoffs, Thomas played a crucial role in the Suns run to the Western Conference Finals. Starting in place of injured All-Star Amar'e Stoudemire (who did not play the entirety of the playoffs), Thomas scored a game-high 22 points with 15 rebounds in a game 1 victory in the first round over the Lakers. In game 6, Thomas hit the game-tying three at the end of regulation and an important three-pointer late in overtime to seal the Suns' win. The Suns won game 7, overcoming a 3–1 series deficit.\nIn the Suns' second-round series against the Clippers, Thomas was credited for his defense on Elton Brand, helping the team to another seven-game series win. In the Western Conference Finals, Phoenix fell to the Dallas Mavericks in six games. In game five of that series, Thomas \"blew a kiss\" to Maverick Dirk Nowitzki, who then proceeded to score a total of 50 points for the game. Thomas expressed an interest in re-signing with Phoenix, though the Suns were over the salary cap and expected Stoudemire to return as their starter.\nLos Angeles Clippers.\nOn July 13, 2006, Thomas signed a four-year, $24 million contract with the Los Angeles Clippers. He frequently started in place of Elton Brand and Chris Kaman, though Thomas himself also battled injuries.\nSecond stint with New York.\nOn November 21, 2008, Thomas and Cuttino Mobley were traded to the New York Knicks, in exchange for Zach Randolph and Mardy Collins. In his return to the Knicks, Thomas was reunited with Mike D'Antoni, who was his coach in Phoenix.\nSecond stint with Chicago.\nOn February 19, 2009, Thomas was traded again to the Bulls along with center Jerome James and guard Anthony Roberson in exchange for guard Larry Hughes just before the trade deadline. His second stint in Chicago was more successful than his first, as he provided veteran leadership to the young team, helping the Bulls make a late-season push to qualify for the playoffs. Though entering the playoffs as the seventh seed, they were able to push their first-round series against the defending-champion Boston Celtics to a full seven games.\nOn July 14, 2009, the Bulls negotiated a buyout of Thomas's $6.5 million contract.\nDallas Mavericks.\nOn July 28, 2009, the Dallas Mavericks signed free agent Thomas. In late January, however, he left the team temporarily to take care of his wife, who had an undisclosed illness.\nIn August 2010 Thomas agreed to a one-year deal with the Mavericks worth the veteran minimum. In September of that year, however, he told the club that he would not report to the team so that he could care for his sick wife.\nCoaching career.\nOn March 30, 2023, Thomas was named as head coach of the boys basketball team at Paramus Catholic High School in Paramus, New Jersey."

        "text": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1874 was the cricket season when the English club Derbyshire earned the title of Champion County in their fourth year playing as a club. Kent joined Lancashire to make the second County side to play first class matches against Derbyshire in 1874. Derbyshire won three first-class matches and drew one, making it the only season in which they never lost a match.\n1874 season.\nDerbyshire were considered Champion County with other teams because at the time the smallest number of games lost decided the order of merit. Through no fault of their own, Derbyshire were able to arrange matches only against Lancashire and Kent, three of which ended in victory and the other in a draw. In fact Derbyshire played four other matches in the season, and lost none of them either. They played two matches against Yorkshire United which were draws. The other matches were against Nottinghamshire and United South of England Eleven, which they won by 14 and 11 wickets respectively. Their convincing wins may be attributable to the fact that they had sixteen players to their opponents' eleven\nSamuel Richardson was in his fourth season as captain. Abraham Shuker, a schoolmaster at Trent College, and John Tye, a blacksmith, made their debut for the county and went on to play several more seasons. There were also single match appearances for the 1874 season only from veteran Walter Boden, lace manufacturer, Edward Estridge, a Repton schoolmaster and John Frost, a joiner and John Cooke, both from Wirksworth. Additionally Henry Shaw and George Hay, who made their first class debuts in the following season appeared in Derbyshire's other matches as did CF Richardson.\nThose who played their last season for Derbyshire were Thomas Attenborough and Joseph Davidson who played in Derbyshire's first match in 1871, and Richard Allsop, who joined in 1872.\nDerbyshire played their home first-class matches at two new venues. Against Kent they played at Derby Road Ground, Wirksworth and against Lancashire they played at Saltergate, Chesterfield. They used the County Ground for their other miscellaneous matches.\nDerbyshire opened the season with a return of their match against Nottinghamshire in the previous season, when again they played 16 men to 11. Derbyshire scored 163 in the first innings and Notts were only able to score 65 and had to follow on. Nottinghamshire scored 125 in their second innings and Derbyshire were able to make the 28 run difference to win for the loss of one wicket. The first County match was against Lancashire, when Derbyshire scored 190 in their first innings and had Lancashire out for 38. In the follow on Lancashire made 181 and Derbyshire made the 30 runs needed to win for the loss of one wicket. The third match was a two-day fixture against Yorkshire United when Yorkshire replied with 232 to Derbyshire's first innings total of 105. Derbyshire reached 223 for 7 in their second innings when time ran out and the result was a draw. The next county match was Derbyshire's first against Kent. Derbyshire scored 97 in their first innings and Kent replied with 25. Derbyshire scored 36 in the second innings and Derbyshire got Kent all out for 75 to take the game. In the next match against Kent, Kent scored 88 and Derbyshire replied with 92. Kent managed 198 in their second innings but Derbyshire matched it for seven wickets to take the game. In the last County match against Lancashire, Derbyshire made 161 in the first innings and Lancashire responded with 104. However, there was no play on the last day and the game ended in a draw. The second match against Yorkshire United also ended in a draw with Yorkshire scoring 183, Derbyshire replying with 129 and Yorkshire making 152 in their second innings. The last match of the season was against a United South of England Eleven when again Derbyshire had the advantage of 16 players. The South scored 167 and Derbyshire replied with 202. In their second innings, the South made 86 and Derbyshire reached the necessary 52 for the loss of four wickets.\nGeorge Frost scored most runs in first class matches and William Mycroft took most first class wickets."

        "text": "Gustav Fischer (8 November 1915 – 22 November 1990) was a Swiss equestrian athlete who competed at five Summer Olympic Games, winning a total of five medals. He won medals in the team dressage events in the 1952, 1956, 1964, and 1968 games; there was no team dressage event held in 1960, but he won an individual dressage medal in that year.\nIn 1968, he and fellow equestrian Henri Chammartin jointly became the second Swiss sportspersons to compete at five Olympic Games. (The first was middle-distance runner Paul Martin.)\nEarly life.\nFischer was born on 8 November 1915 in Meisterschwanden, Switzerland.\nOlympic career.\nFischer first competed in the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland at the age of 36, in both the individual and team dressage events. He came in a disappointing 8th place in the individual event, behind both of his Swiss teammates; Gottfried Trachsel, who finished 4th, and Henri Chammartin, who finished 6th. However, he earned the first of five Olympic medals, a silver, in the team event with Trachsel and Chammartin. Four years later, at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden, Fischer again medaled in the team event, and again fell short in the individual. This time, Trachsel, Chammartin, and Fischer took bronze, and finished 6th, 8th, and 10th respectively in the individual event.\nOf the three athletes, only Fischer and Chammartin would compete in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy, although in any case no team dressage event was held that year. However, Fischer found new success, winning second place and a silver medal in the individual dressage competition, the only individual medal of his career. The 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, saw Fischer as the oldest member of the Swiss team, at 48 years of age. That year, he just missed winning a second individual medal in dressage, taking fourth place while his teammate Henri Chammartin took gold. However, with Chammartin and 21-year-old Marianne Gossweiler, the youngest Swiss equestrian athlete at the games, Fischer earned yet another silver medal in team dressage. He won his final Olympic medal at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, Mexico at the age of 52, a bronze in team dressage, again with Chammartin and Gossweiler.\nLater life.\nFischer died on 22 November 1990."

For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually one at a time from spare round holders or bullets deposited by the competitor into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still misses, one 150 m penalty loop must be taken for each missed target remaining. The first-leg participants start all at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (Bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of position in race.), then for the remainder of the relay, the relay team shoots at the lane in the position they arrived (Arrive at the range in 5th place, you shoot at lane five.)."

Defending titlist is German team.\nCompetition format.\nThe relay teams consist of four biathletes, who each ski , each leg skied over three laps, with two shooting rounds; one prone, one standing. For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually one at a time from spare round holders or bullets deposited by the competitor into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still misses, one 150 m penalty loop must be taken for each missed target remaining. The first-leg participants start all at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (Bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of position in race.), then for the remainder of the relay, the relay team shoots at the lane in the position they arrived (Arrive at the range in 5th place, you shoot at lane five.)."

Cooper was one of many first base prospects taken in the first round of the draft after other highly regarded college hitters such as Yonder Alonso, Brett Wallace, and Justin Smoak. In scouting reports prior to the draft, Cooper was regarded as a highly polished college bat who can hit for both average and plus home run power in the majors, but was seen as defensively limited and projected to play at 1B or DH at the major league level.\nProfessional career.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nHe was playing with the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s in the Blue Jays organization, until he was called up to the Blue Jays on April 29, 2011.\nCooper made his major league debut on April 29, 2011, against the New York Yankees, playing the DH position and batting 7th in the line-up.

After serving with the United States Army in the Korean War, he became a boys' basketball coach at Loyola Academy in Wilmette, Illinois, and guided them to three Chicago Catholic League titles between 1957 and 1967. In 1967, he became an assistant coach to Johnny Dee at the University of Notre Dame, and hoped to succeed Dee as head coach. When Dee retired in 1971, however, the school hired Digger Phelps as head coach, and a disappointed Sullivan spent the next few years writing a basketball book and running a limousine company.\nFrom 1975 to 1978, Sullivan worked as DePaul University's athletic director. He then became athletic director at Loyola University Chicago, and took over as men's basketball coach in 1980. In 1985, his Loyola Ramblers, led by Alfredrick Hughes, reached the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, where they lost to Georgetown University–their deepest NCAA Tournament run in 31 years. Sullivan left Loyola in 1989 with a 149-114 career record.\nSullivan spent the next few years as head of recreational programs for the Chicago Park District. He later worked as director of an anti-gang youth program with the Cook County State's Attorney's office and as a radio analyst for DePaul basketball radio broadcasts. He died of a staph infection at age 70 in February 2002.\nLoyola returned to the NCAA Tournament in 2018 for the first time since Sullivan's team made its 1985 appearance.

It was released in North America on October 30, 2001, and in Europe on February 15, 2002.\n\"Boxing Fever\" is a first person boxing game, portrayed from the perspective of the player's fighter. Multiplayer is supported through the link cable. \"Boxing Fever\" received positive reviews from critics, who noted its creative visual style.\nGameplay.\nThe game gives the player the perspective of the fighter, in a first person view; the graphical engine gives the illusion of 3D. The user punches and blocks with the d-pad, while avoiding punches entirely by weaving with the shoulder buttons.\nThere are four championships for the player to complete in throughout the course of gameplay; all of them are available from the start of gameplay and do not need to be earned through performance in the game. \"Boxing Fever\" lacks a battery save feature, and instead uses an 8-digit password system.\nReception.\nThe game received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Praise for the game focused on its graphics and its control scheme. \"IGN\"s Craig Harris spoke positively of the game's graphical design and frantic pace; he awarded the game an IGN Editor's Choice Award and compared the game to the \"Punch-Out!!\" series by Nintendo. \"Eurogamer\"s Tom Bramwell felt the game successfully carried on the \"Punch Out!!\" legacy on the Game Boy Advance, and was favorable of the game's animation. \"GameZone\"s Michael Lafferty noted that game felt realistic. \nCriticism of the game focused mostly on the repetitive nature of the fights, the password save system, and the little amount of content found in the game. \"GameSpot\"s Ryan MacDonald felt that the control scheme for \"Boxing Fever\" caused the game to feel repetitive, and he lamented the lack of a battery save system. Bramwell called the password save system \"atrocious\" and negatively compared it to the system found in \"GT Advance Championship Racing\"."

It still feels fresh. I want to win a championship, and we were right there. We were close. We didn't do what we needed to do to win, but we have a lot of the guys coming back this year, same guys. A lot of our core guys, and we believe that puts us in the mix. So we have to handle business this offseason as far as continuing to get better on a daily basis.

        "text": "Fairmount Rowing Association is an amateur rowing club, founded in 1877. The facility, located at #2 Boathouse Row in the historic Boathouse Row of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is on the National Register of Historic Places. Fairmount originally catered to blue-collar youths living in the Fairmount neighborhood. In 1916, after decades of being rejected, the club was finally allowed to join the Schuylkill Navy. The Club boasts being known as the \"premiere club for Masters rowing in the mid-Atlantic region\" and has produced several world class rowers.\nHistory of the boathouse.\nThe structure currently known as #2 Boathouse Row is a result of a 1945 expansion project that eliminated #3 Boathouse Row by merging it into Fairmount Rowing Association's building at #2 Boathouse Row.\nPacific Barge Club.\nPacific Barge Club was founded in 1859, but was not a member of the Schuylkill Navy. In 1860, Pacific Barge Club built a stone cottage-style boathouse at the site of #2 Boathouse row. Half of the building was occupied by the Pacific Barge Club while the other half was rented to the Philadelphia Boat Club. In 1881, the Fairmount Rowing Association purchased #2 Boathouse Row and Pacific Barge Club's equipment.\nIn 1904, Fairmount Rowing demolished the stone building built by Pacific Barge Club. Walter Smedley, a founder of the T-Square Club, designed the Georgian Revival style Flemish bond brick structure that replaced the 1860 stone boathouse and now occupies the southern half of the Fairmount Rowing's boathouse. Smedley, specialized in colonial revival residences, and also designed the Northern National Bank and the West Philadelphia Title and Trust Company.\nCamilla Boat Club and Quaker City Barge Club.\nCamilla Boat Club was a founding member of the Schuylkill Navy. Camilla was a champion of the Schuylkill, but the Club disband as a result of disagreements between members. In 1858, the remnants of the defunct Camilla Boat Club reorganized to form Quaker City Barge Club.\nBy 1866, Quaker City Barge Club had purchased #3 Boathouse Row from the Pacific Barge Club. Among various rowing accomplishment, Quaker City raced the first four oared boat with coxswain. The Quaker City Barge Club began to decline in the 1880s and never raced in the Schuylkill Navy Regatta after 1926. In 1932, the Quaker City Barge Club declared itself “inactive” in the Schuylkill Navy and became completely defunct in the 1940s. In 1945, under the leadership of John Carlin, Fairmount Rowing Association bought Quaker City Barge Club's equipment and absorbed its boathouse, which now serves as the northern half of Fairmount Rowing's boathouse."

        "text": "Jeremy Smith (born April 13, 1989), also known as Jieruimi Shimisi, is an American-born Chinese professional ice hockey goaltender. Born in the United States, he is currently playing with HC Kunlun Red Star of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) and represented China at the 2022 Winter Olympics. Smith was selected in the second round, 54th overall, by the Nashville Predators in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft.\nPlaying career.\nSince turning professional in the 2009–10 season, Smith, while within the Predators organization, was shuffled between the Milwaukee Admirals of the AHL and the Cincinnati Cyclones of the ECHL.\nOn July 5, 2013, Smith signed a one-year contract as a free agent with the Columbus Blue Jackets. After attending the Blue Jackets training camp he was assigned to AHL affiliate, the Springfield Falcons\".\nOn July 2, 2014, Smith signed a one-year, two-way contract with the Boston Bruins. Smith was sent down to Providence Bruins to be a call up along with Malcolm Subban for the majority of the season.\nOn July 1, 2015, the Boston Bruins re-signed Smith to a one-year, two-way contract. With Smith unable to earn the backup role and with the Bruins suffering a surplus of goaltenders in their system, he was assigned on loan to AHL affiliate club of the Minnesota Wild, the Iowa Wild, for the duration of the 2015–16 season on October 6, 2015. On February 6, 2016, Providence's Malcolm Subban was hospitalized after taking a puck to the throat. With Subban ruled out for eight weeks due to this injury, Smith was recalled from his loan with the Iowa Wild to provide Providence with cover. In Subban's absence, Smith was a standout for Providence, posting 13 wins in 20 games and earning his first recall to the NHL, on an emergency basis, on April 9, 2016. He was returned to the AHL for the post-season without featuring for the Bruins.\nAt the conclusion of the season, Smith left the Bruins organization as a free agent. On July 1, 2016, he signed a one-year, two-way contract to join the Colorado Avalanche. Smith began the 2016–17 season in the AHL with affiliate, the San Antonio Rampage. He was injured in his third game with the Rampage and missed two months of action before returning to post his first win with the Rampage in a 4–2 victory over the Tucson Roadrunners on December 17, 2016. On December 27, Smith was recalled by the Avalanche after injury to starting goaltender Semyon Varlamov and backed up Calvin Pickard for five games before he was returned to the Rampage on January 5, 2017. With Varlamov suffering a season-ending injury, Smith was recalled on a second occasion on February 9, 2017. He made his NHL debut with the Avalanche, making 37 saves in a 3–2 defeat to the New Jersey Devils on February 14, 2017. In his third start with the Avalanche he received his first NHL win, making 34 saves in the team's 5–3 win over the Buffalo Sabres on February 25, 2017.\nAs a free agent in the off-season, Smith left the Avalanche to sign a one-year, two-way contract with the Carolina Hurricanes on July 1, 2017. For the following 2017–18 season, Smith was unable to add to his NHL experience, assigned to the AHL affiliate Charlotte Checkers for the duration of the campaign. In 30 games, Smith collected 13 wins and posted a goals against average of 2.71.\nAt the completion of his contract with the Hurricanes, Smith became a free agent and agreed to sign a one-year AHL contract with the Bridgeport Sound Tigers on July 9, 2018. In the following 2018–19 season, Smith had collected 16 wins through 32 games for the Sound Tigers before he was signed to a two-way contract by the New York Islanders for the remainder of the year on February 24, 2019. In adding depth to the goaltending ranks of the playoff-bound Islanders, Smith would continue to play with their AHL affiliate.\nOn June 10, 2019, Smith as an impending free agent, signed his first contract abroad, agreeing to a two-year contract with Chinese outfit Kunlun Red Star of the KHL.\nInternational play.\nDue to his stint in China, Smith was called up to represent the China men's national ice hockey team for the 2022 Winter Olympics. According to some sources, he became a Chinese citizen in order to be eligible to represent the nation at the Olympics. Smith's teammate Jake Chelios confirmed that he kept his American citizenship but refused to answer whether he was a naturalized Chinese citizen. While the Olympic Charter stipulates that any athlete competing in the Games must be a national of the country of the NOC which is entering such competitor, the IOC Executive Board has the authority to make certain exceptions of a \"general or individual nature\", though it is unclear whether this was the case.\nDuring the games, the pinyin version of the Chinese transcription of Smith's name, Jieruimi Shimisi, was used for commentary and statistics records by the IOC."

        "text": "The 2010 FIFA World Cup generated various controversies, including some from before the tournament started. Most centred on refereeing.\nQualification.\nFrance vs. Republic of Ireland.\nIn the second leg of the qualification play-off match between France and the Republic of Ireland on 18 November 2009, French captain Thierry Henry, unseen by the referee and other match officials, illegally handled the ball twice in the lead up to the winning goal. The incident caused widespread debate about FIFA Fair Play, and how matches should be refereed at the highest level. The Football Association of Ireland (FAI) requested a replay of the game on grounds of fairness, but was denied by FIFA under the Laws of the Game. On 2 December, FIFA called an extraordinary general meeting of the Executive Committee to discuss various issues, with the Henry incident high on the agenda. FIFA announced they would be setting up an inquiry into technology and extra officials in the game, but they did not announce a widely expected move of the fast-tracked introduction of goal-line referee's assistants, already being trialled in the UEFA Europa League, and confirmed the competition in South Africa would be officiated as normal with a referee, two assistants, and a fourth official. On the subject of fair Play, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said:\nOn 5 June 2015 it was determined that the Football Association of Ireland were paid €5 million by FIFA not to protest about Thierry Henry's handball.\nAlgeria vs. Egypt.\nThe teams finished level on 13 points and level on all tiebreakers: goal difference in all group matches (+5); goals scored in all group matches (9); points in all Algeria–Egypt matches (3); and goal difference in all Algeria–Egypt matches (0). (The away goals rule was not used as a group-stage tiebreaker). The teams met in a one-game play-off to decide the qualifier. To determine the match venue, each team selected a country other than their own (Algeria selected Tunisia and Egypt selected Sudan). After Sudan was drawn in a lottery on 11 November, the Al Merreikh Stadium in Omdurman was selected by FIFA as the venue for the play-off. The decision to play a tie-breaking playoff game to determine who qualifies to the 2010 FIFA World Cup was controversial because despite the fact that Algeria and Egypt were level on all tiebreakers listed above, Egypt would have qualified based on the away goals rule, which was used to determine the winner of a tie in the case of a tiebreaker in both previous and subsequent qualifiers. Algeria won the match in Sudan 1–0 to qualify for the World Cup.\nAnimal sacrifices.\nPlans to slaughter a cow at each stadium to be used for the World Cup generated concern among animal rights groups. The Makhonya Royal Trust proposed the concept stating the cattle killing event was a \"true African\" way of blessing the tournament.\nThe issue of cattle sacrifice was discussed by a High Court. Judge Nic Van der Reyden said the matter needed to be taken up by politicians.\nAn ox was slaughtered at Johannesburg's Soccer City stadium on 25 May. A place was created within the Soccer City precinct to act as a \"kraal\" where the ox was slaughtered. After that, the senior traditional healers walked into the stadium in song, drum-beating and dance, where they continued to bless the inside of the stadium with rituals.\nGroup stage.\nBrazil vs. Côte d'Ivoire.\nBrazilian striker Luís Fabiano handled the ball twice in the build-up to Brazil's second goal, which helped Brazil win the match 3–1. Brazilian midfielder Kaká was sent off late in the game for a collision with Ivorian midfielder Kader Keïta. Replays showed Keïta had run into Kaká's side, deliberately striking Kaká's shoulder, and then fell to the ground holding his face in a successful attempt to have Kaká sent off.\nSlovenia vs. USA.\nWith the match tied 2–2 in the 86th minute, Maurice Edu of the United States appeared to score the winning goal from a set piece, but referee Koman Coulibaly disallowed the goal and awarded a free-kick to Slovenia. Because Coulibaly had blown for the free-kick before the goal had been scored, he was not required to (and did not) explain the call on the pitch or to FIFA officials afterwards. Replays showed numerous Slovenian players pulling and hanging on Americans, fighting for position in the box, but no foul or offsides by the Americans was apparent to justify disallowing the goal. US striker Robbie Findley was also given a mysterious yellow card, which resulted in him missing the next match against Algeria. Although the match ended in a 2–2 draw, the United States ultimately went on to win the group. Coulibaly received a \"poor\" performance review for the match and was selected to only one additional match in the tournament, as the 4th referee.\nAustralia vs. Serbia.\nAfter the previous two matches, both could still reach the round of 16. However, with Australia having one point and a -4 goal difference while Serbia had three points and a 0 goal difference, Serbia seemingly had the better chance to advance to the next round. During the last minutes of the match, with Serbia losing 2-1, Australia's Tim Cahill clearly hit the ball with his hand in the box, but the officials decided not to award a penalty for Serbia, and play continued; also Serbia had a late goal disallowed for what appeared to be a questionable offside. With Ghana losing to Germany 1–0, a second goal would have given Serbia runners-up spot in the group and advancement to the Round of 16.\nRound of 16.\nOn 27 June, during two round of 16 matches, two incidents occurred that led to renewed debate over the lack of video technology in refereeing– the disallowing of England midfielder Frank Lampard's goal against Germany, and an Argentinian goal against Mexico that was allowed despite being scored from an offside position.\nGermany vs. England.\nDuring England's 4–1 loss to Germany, Lampard's shot hit the crossbar and then crossed the goal-line before bouncing back out to German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Linesman Mauricio Espinosa and referee Jorge Larrionda did not award the goal but subsequent replays and photographic evidence showed the ball had indeed crossed the goal-line. This incident reignited demands for goal-line technology. This was also significant as England were trailing 1–2 at the time so had Lampard's \"goal\" have stood then it would have brought England level in the match.\nArgentina vs Mexico.\nDuring the Argentina vs. Mexico match Carlos Tevez scored from an offside position from within the Mexican penalty box when the game stood at 0–0. Although against FIFA's ruling, the screens inside the stadium of Soccer City showed replays of Tevez more than a yard offside when Lionel Messi played the ball towards him. The goal stood, causing uproar and protests from the Mexican players and staff. Referee Roberto Rosetti stuck with his decision. Argentina subsequently won the match 3–1. Following the Argentinian goal, BBC commentators wrote that \"linesman Stefano Ayroldi [...] somehow allowed Carlos Tevez's goal to stand before a ridiculous situation developed where he, referee Roberto Rosetti and everyone in the stadium watched replays on the huge screens show exactly how far offside Tevez was\"; pundit Alan Hansen added: \"Before today I was not an advocate of technology in football, but now I am a convert.\" Associated Press sports columnist John Leicester reacted to the match between England and Germany by writing:\nThe press spoke of:\nA few days later, FIFA President Sepp Blatter stated that he deplored the \"evident referee mistakes\" in England vs. Germany and Mexico vs. Argentina matches, and apologised to the English and Mexican football federations (\"the two federations directly concerned by referee's mistakes\"). He added: \"It is obvious that after the experiences so far at this World Cup it would be a nonsense not to re-open the file on goal-line technology. [...] We will come out with a new model in November on how to improve high-level referees. [...] I cannot disclose more of what we are doing but something has to be changed.\"\nSuárez handball.\nIn extra time of a quarter-final match against Ghana, Uruguayan striker Luis Suárez handled the ball in the penalty area to prevent a last-minute game-winning Ghana goal. Suárez was shown a red card and Ghana's Asamoah Gyan missed the resulting penalty kick. Ghana subsequently lost the match, 4–2, in the penalty shootout.\nThe African press named Uruguay public enemy No.1 and described them as cheats. Suárez was unapologetic about his handball, stating \"I made the best save of the tournament.\" Suárez boasted after the match of his handball save, claiming that \"The 'Hand of God' now belongs to me,\" a reference to the handball goal scored by Diego Maradona in the 1986 World Cup. Ghana's coach Milovan Rajevac argued that Suárez's actions were \"really shocking,\" describing the result as a \"football injustice.\" Uruguay's coach Óscar Tabárez defended Suárez: \"Saying we cheated Ghana is too harsh a word to use. ... We also abide by what the referee did. It could have been a mistake. Yes, he stuck his hand out, but it's not cheating. What else do you want? Is Suárez also to blame for Ghana missing the penalty? We try to be dignified, and if we lose a match, we look for the reasons for it. You shouldn't look to third parties.\" FIFA reviewed the possibility of increasing Suárez's ban but decided against punishing him for 'unsportsmanlike conduct'. This opened up a discussion on gamesmanship, asking the question of whether players in that situation should be condemned as a cheat, or applauded for their resourcefulness. One pundit, Paul Fletcher of the BBC, implied that most players would do the same thing in the 'heat of the moment' in order to avoid defeat. Ghana's sports minister, Akua Sena Dansua, called for changes to the rules in such circumstances.\nFrench team discord.\nThe French team had significant troubles with team dissension at the World Cup. The press was strongly critical of both players and coaches. This followed a highly disappointing UEFA Euro 2008 first round exit, and a difficult qualification campaign. After controversially winning their play-off meeting with the Republic of Ireland, the French players appeared aloof to the public as they headed straight for the dressing room instead of signing autographs. Several players were questioned by police just prior to the Finals in South Africa, following a raid on a Paris nightclub renowned for arranging dates between wealthy clients and underage prostitutes. Before the tournament began, the French Football Federation (FFF) announced that head coach Raymond Domenech will leave his position at the end of the tournament.\nStriker Nicolas Anelka delivered a profanity-laden criticism at Domenech as the team was losing to Mexico.\nAnelka was sent home after refusing to apologise. The following day, captain and left wingback Patrice Evra was caught on camera in a heated argument with trainer Robert Duverne, which eventually led to intervention by others in the camp. The players boycotted training for one day in protest at the FFF decision to dismiss Anelka. In turn, managing director Jean-Louis Valentin then resigned in disgust at the players' actions.\nOn the orders of President Nicolas Sarkozy, Sports Minister Roselyne Bachelot held an emotional meeting with the team where she admonished the players saying \"How would you like people to remember you? What image do you want to leave behind?\". This reportedly reduced the players, especially the younger ones, to tears and they applauded her. Later at an impromptu media briefing at the Free State Stadium, Bachelot said \"I told the players they had tarnished the image of France. It is a morale disaster for French football. I told them they could no longer be heroes for our children. They have destroyed the dreams of their countrymen, their friends and supporters.\" The players apologised to Domenech and resumed practice the next day. Patrice Evra was dropped for the final group game.\nFollowing the team's final defeat to hosts South Africa, Domenech refused to shake the hand of opposing coach Carlos Alberto Parreira. Domenech was strongly criticised in the French press, with sports daily \"L'Équipe\" accusing Domenech of \"arrogance and an attitude of contempt for others\".\nThe French team flew home in economy class. The fallout continued after the team's return to France, with FFF President Jean-Pierre Escalettes announcing his resignation. Escalettes has stated that Anelka will never be picked again for the national team. Former defender Lilian Thuram has said \"I asked for the players to be severely punished and for Patrice Evra never to come back into the France team. When you are captain of France, there is a responsibility and a respect for the shirt and for people that you have to have.\"\nThe entire World Cup squad was suspended for their next game against Norway by the FFF, upon request by the new manager Laurent Blanc. Five players were identified as having been key to the embarrassing events at the tournament; Nicolas Anelka, Patrice Evra, Franck Ribéry, Jérémy Toulalan and Eric Abidal were summoned to a hearing before the FFF disciplinary committee on 17 August 2010. After the expulsion of Anelka and ensuing training strike, Evra and Ribéry were summoned for failing in their duties as captain and vice captain, Toulalan was seen as the originator of the statement read out by coach Domenech to the media, while Abidal was accused of refusing to play in the final group match. After the hearing, Anelka was banned from playing for France for 18 games, Evra was banned for five, Ribéry for three, and Toulalan for one, while Abidal escaped punishment. Anelka dismissed the sanction as irrelevant, considering himself already retired from international football.\nFinal.\nThe final was particularly controversial due to the high number of yellow cards issued (fourteen, resulting in one sending-off). The most notable incident was Nigel de Jong's kick into the midriff of Xabi Alonso, punished only with a booking from referee Howard Webb, who subsequently admitted he should have shown a red card.\nJust before the game-winning goal was scored, the Dutch team had a free kick that hit the wall (apparently taking a deflection off Cesc Fàbregas) before going out. Despite the deflection, which should have given possession and a corner kick to the Dutch team, a goal kick was given to the Spanish, starting the play that led to the winning goal. The Dutch, however, momentarily had possession of the ball near the Spanish penalty area in between the goal kick and Iniesta's goal. Joris Mathijsen was yellow-carded for his strong protests to the referee after the goal, and other Dutch players criticised Webb for this decision after the match.\nBoth teams were fined by FIFA due to the ill-discipline of the match. Despite this, Spain was still awarded FIFA's Fair Play award for the tournament after the final, Spain had earned only 8 yellow cards throughout (the lowest of the four semi-finalists).\nOthers.\nThird-party ambush marketing.\nDuring the Netherlands v Denmark group stage match, several women were removed from the stadium and later detained. It later emerged they were models for Bavaria beer. The tickets were sold to Bavaria by a friend of Robbie Earle, who was working as a pundit at the tournament for ITV Sport of the United Kingdom. ITV immediately cancelled Earle's contract with the network, citing that the tickets were only meant for his friends and family.\nMatch ball.\nThe official ball for the tournament, the Jabulani, was widely criticised by several players, although others came out in its defence.\nNigeria team ban.\nIn the aftermath of the tournament, Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan announced a 2-year ban on the men's national side due to its perceived poor performance. This move drew serious criticism and condemnation for all sides, and FIFA threatened sanctions in return for what it saw as \"political interference\". The ban was lifted shortly after.\nNorth Korea.\nThe North Korean team cancelled its national championship to prepare for the Cup via a world tour. Following the perceived poor performance of the team, particularly against Portugal, the team were forced to blame the coach to avoid punishment on their return to North Korea."

He played club rugby for Gloucester and appeared in four games for England during the 1910 season. He died serving his country during the First World War.\nPersonal history.\nBerry was born on 8 January 1883 in Gloucester to James and Hannah Berry. One of ten children he was educated at St Mark's School in his home town. A career soldier, he joined the British Army at the age of 16 and served with the 4th Battalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment. He was posted to South Africa after the outbreak of the Second Boer War. In March 1900 he was posted to the Atlantic island of Saint Helena where he served as a prison guard for two years. He remained on after his battalion returned to Britain and instead joined the 1st Battalion Gloucester Regiment which was posted to Trincomalee in Ceylon. He remained there until 1909 when he was forced to return to England to recover after contracting malaria.\nHe married Beatrice Evelyn Arnold in 1910 and they became publicans, running first the Red Lion and then The Stag's Head. Their first child, Henry George Berry was born in August 1911. Berry remained a reservist throughout his time in England, and with the outbreak of the First World War he was called back into service as a corporal in the 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment. He was posted to France in 1915 and was killed in action on 9 May 1915 at Aubers Ridge. A month later Beatrice gave birth to his second child, a daughter, Phyllis Irene.\nIn 2006, one of his grandchildren appeared on the BBC television programme Antiques Roadshow, filmed at Gloucester Cathedral, with some of his caps.\nRugby career.\nBerry first became interested in rugby while at St Mark's School. A heavy forward player he retained his interest in the sport throughout his army career, and played for D company out in India. On returning to England in 1909, he became a member of Gloucester Rugby and within a year he has shown enough quality to be called into the England national team for the 1910 Five Nations Championship. His first international was against Wales in the opening game of the tournament. England won 11-6 and Berry played well enough to gain reselection for the following three games of the tournament. England drew 0–0 against Ireland, and on 3 March 1910 Berry scored one of three tries in the away win over France. He scored a second try in the win against Scotland, which gave England the Championship.\n1910 also saw Berry selected at county level for Gloucestershire, playing in the county final against Yorkshire."

E. G. Wilson. He was educated at Dover College and joined the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in July 1892. He graduated in July 1896 and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Queen's (Royal West Surrey) Regiment on 22 July 1896.\nMilitary career.\nWilson served with his regiment in the Second Boer War, where he took part in the relief of Ladysmith, including the battles of Spion Kop (January 1900) and the Tugela Heights (February 1900). On 24 August 1901 he was promoted to the rank of captain, and in April 1902 he was appointed a staff officer as an Assistant Provost-Marshal in South Africa. He stayed there until after the end of the war, leaving Cape Town on the SS \"Orient\" in October 1902, and was back as a regular officer with his regiment on his return. For his war service, he was mentioned in Despatches, and received the Queen's Medal with two clasps and the King's Medal with two clasps.\nHe later served in India.\nDuring the First World War, Wilson served as the adjutant of the 1st Battalion, Queen's (Royal West Surrey) Regiment, attached to the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division. He served on the Western Front and was awarded the Légion d’Honneur. He was killed in action on 17 September 1914 during the Battle of the Aisne, on the River Aisne. He is buried in Paissy Churchyard, Aisne, France [Grave 2], and was survived by his wife Mabel (née Carr) and their two sons.\nRugby career.\nWilson played rugby at a high standard as a forward. He represented the Army and top class side Blackheath F.C., and was an active member of the club in 1895, the year he was offered and accepted an invitation to tour with the Barbarians. In 1898, and still playing for Blackheath, Wilson represented England in a rugby union international, playing as a forward against in a match played at Richmond as part of the 1898 Home Nations Championship. The England team, under the captaincy of J. F. Byrne, was fairly inexperienced with Wilson being one of six new caps into the team, four within the pack. The Irish controlled the game from the start and won 9–6. Wilson never represented his country again."

        "title": "List of international rugby union players killed in World War I",
        "text": "This is a list of international rugby union players who died serving in armed forces during the First World War. Most of these came from the British Commonwealth, but a number of French international rugby players were also killed. A number of major teams, whose nations were belligerents in World War I such as , , , , and had not made their international debuts at this point in time, and the team had only been in existence for around two years prior to the war.\nAlso, none of the Central Powers had true national rugby squads at this point although there had been rugby clubs in Germany since the late 19th century, and the German Rugby Federation is the oldest national rugby union in \"continental\" Europe. However, Germany did put forward a team for rugby union at the 1900 Summer Olympics (although not the 1908 tournament, which involved only two sides) – Olympic rugby was not seen as particularly prestigious – and it is not known if any of that team were war casualties.\nThe war took an extremely heavy toll upon rugby at all levels, and this list includes some major figures, such as Dave Gallaher, who led a major All Blacks tour to the British Isles in 1905; David Bedell-Sivright, who is sometimes considered one of the greatest Scottish players of all time; and Ronnie Poulton-Palmer who is similarly honoured by the English; and the Frenchman Jean Bouin, better known as a middle distance runner at the 1908 Olympics as well as the 1912 Games.\nThe first rugby international to die in World War I was France and Stade Toulousain scrum-half Alfred Mayssonnié on 6 September 1914.\nList by country.\nAustralia.\nAlthough many rugby players were killed during the war, a large number were also injured or crippled, leading to their departure from the game. For example, the and British Isles player Tom Richards had his back and shoulders damaged by a bomb blast and suffered respiratory problems the rest of his life, from gas attacks he had experienced on the Western Front, leading to his death from TB in 1935.\nEngland.\nOne of the most poignant stories is of Ronnie Poulton-Palmer, who had played against the South African tourists of 1912–13 only a few years before:\nEngland had over twenty six players killed in the conflict. This was the second highest number of casualties, after . However, many of the Scotland players were \"Anglos\", i.e. based, born or playing in the England's domestic leagues for teams such as London Scottish FC or universities, so their loss affected English rugby too.\nHenry Brougham is sometimes listed, because he died of war wounds. However, since he died in 1923, after the war had ended, he is also often omitted.\nFrance.\nFrance is different from all the other nations mentioned on this list for two reasons – firstly, it was not part of the British Commonwealth nor English speaking, and secondly, unlike the other nations, it actually had a military front in its border territory.\nMaurice Boyau particularly distinguished himself as a balloon buster and military flying ace, with 35 victories under his belt. He spent much of his flying career with Escadrille 77, known as \"Les Sportifs\" for the great number of athletes in its ranks. He had been captain of the French team before the war.\nStade Bordelais of Bordeaux was badly affected, losing players such as Boyau and Giacardy.\nGerman Empire.\nA German team competed at the 1900 Olympic tournament, represented by players from the SC 1880 Frankfurt club. It is not known if any of those 15 players died in the First World War.\nBritish Isles.\nBritish Isles team.\nPre-World War I, it was not uncommon for members of the British Isles team (later known as the British and Irish Lions) to be uncapped for their nation of origin. This never happens now.\nMost British Isles players had been capped for their country, and can be found listed more fully under their respective countries. Capped players include the following.\nOlympians.\nAt least one competitor for the Great Britain Olympic team which competed at rugby union at the 1908 Summer Olympics, and gained silver died –\nScotland and Ireland did not put teams up for either the 1900 or 1908 Olympic rugby events, and most of the players were from England, and in particular Cornwall.\nIreland.\nIreland, unlike Great Britain and much of the British Empire did not have conscription during the war, although there was a disastrous attempt in 1918 to impose it. See also Ireland and World War I.\nNew Zealand.\nThirteen former New Zealand representativesknown as \"All Blacks\"lost their lives in the First World War, with three (possibly four) of them dying in the Battle of Messines.\nScotland.\nAccording to Allan Massie, \"Scotland had suffered more severely than any of the Home Countries from the slaughter of the war. Thirty capped players were lost (twenty six English internationalists were killed).\"\nWhile some of these players were clearly retired, others such as Frederick Harding Turner, James Huggan and John George Will had played in the last match before the war, the Calcutta Cup match in March, 1914, and so had their playing careers prematurely ended. Walter Sutherland was also considered one of Hawick RFC's greatest players, and was still remembered fondly as \"Wattie Suddie\" in Bill McLaren's playing days. Few surviving Scots were capped before and after the war – Charlie Usher, Jock Wemyss and Alex Angus are some of the exceptions. Charlie Usher spent much of the war in a POW camp.\nSouth Africa.\nAdam Burdett was part of the 1906-7 tour to the British Isles. This was the inaugural tour and is recognised as the event that coined the word \"Springboks\" as a nickname for the South Africa team. Poignantly, in the two games he played on that tour in November 1906, he shared the field with David Bedell-Sivright of , and Basil Maclear of , who were also casualties of that war. Likewise, Toby Moll would probably have rubbed shoulders with Eric Milroy, Noel Humphreys or Phil Waller in the 1910 British Isles tour of South Africa.\nWales.\nAmongst the fatalities was Richard Garnons Williams, who had played in the very first Wales international rugby union match in 1881. At 59 years of age, he was the eldest of the 13 Wales international players to be killed during the war.\nCharles Taylor was the first Welsh fatality, and was a noted athlete, especially good at the pole vault.\nFred Perrett is often left out of lists of the Welsh international war dead due to his supposed defection to the professional game.\nUnited States.\nThe captain of the All America side that faced New Zealand in California died in the war.\nDeaths after the war.\nSometimes included are two deaths from war wounds after the war, although both are past the Commonwealth War Graves Commission limit of 31 Aug 1921 (when an order in council declared the war over) to be considered a war death:"

        "text": "Play in Group A of the 2011 Cricket World Cup took place from 20 February to 20 March 2011. The group consisted of hosts Sri Lanka, and along with them, Pakistan, Canada, Kenya, New Zealand, Australia and Zimbabwe. This phase of the tournament was played as a full round-robin amongst all seven teams, with the top four teams advancing to the quarter-finals\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\nKenya vs New Zealand.\nThe first match of Group A saw Kenya taking on the New Zealanders. Kenya won the toss and elected to bat first on a pitch which seemed to have a lot of runs. However, the New Zealanders started very well, restricting the Kenyans for runs throughout the first 6 overs. The pressure paid off as Tim Southee trapped Alex Obanda in front with the score at 16 after 7 overs. Fellow opener Seren Waters and Collins Obuya tried to rebuild but Hamish Bennett came into the attack and got Waters lbw to make the score 40/2. Bennett then ripped through the Kenyan batting and got 3 more wickets in double-quick time to reduce the Kenyans to 49/5. The shattered Kenyans then folded, with only Rakep Patel offering resistance with 16 not out as Southee and Jacob Oram finished off the tail to get Kenya all out for 69 in 23.5 overs.\nThe New Zealand openers started off quickly in their small chase, with Martin Guptill doing most of the early scoring. Brendon McCullum was bowled off a free hit but got into his stride and finished off the game with two successive boundaries, as New Zealand reached their target in just eight overs without losing any wicket, to complete a ten-wicket win.\nSri Lanka vs Canada.\nSri Lanka, one of the co-hosts started off their tournament against minnows Canada. The Sri Lankans won the toss and elected to bat first. Canada bowled well in the early overs, but did not get a wicket, as openers Upul Tharanga and Tillakaratne Dilshan reached 50 runs. When the first wicket did fall, it was a run-out when the batsmen had a mix-up with the score at 63, and Tharanga was dismissed. Dilshan got to his half-century, but fell trying to go for a big hit. The Canadians restricted Sri Lanka to 88/2 with over 19 overs bowled; but the two experienced Sri Lankan batsmen, captain Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene came together and got a partnership of 50. Both batsmen got the run rate to over 6 and both seemed to be coasting to their centuries, until Sangakkara on 92 gave a simple return catch to John Davison with the score at 267/2. Jayawardene reached his century but fell immediately afterwards. More wickets fell and the game got hot-tempered, with a confrontation between Angelo Mathews and Harvir Baidwan and Sri Lanka finished with 332/7.\nThe Canadian chase went nowhere, with Thisara Perera and Nuwan Kulasekara getting three wickets quickly. Captain Ashish Bagai tried to lead a recovery, but once Perera took his wicket to reduce Canada to 53/5, all doubts about the result finished. Big-hitter Rizwan Cheema took 37, including two huge sixes off spinner Muttiah Muralitharan, but the latter ultimately got his wicket as Canada fell to 122 all out.\nAustralia vs Zimbabwe.\nThree-time defending champions Australia opened their tournament against Zimbabwe. Australia won the toss and elected to bat; but it was the Zimbabwean spinners who dominated the early stages despite not getting a wicket; as Australia struggled to 32/0 after 13 overs. The 14th over was hit for 17 runs as the score quickly reached 50, but soon after, Prosper Utseya got Brad Haddin lbw, which was given out of referral. Shane Watson then attacked aggressively as he added 79 with captain Ricky Ponting until Watson was out lbw off Graeme Cremer in similar fashion to Haddin's. Ponting was soon run out, but Michael Clarke and Cameron White took the score past 200 until White was bowled. Clarke reached a half-century, and quick cameos by David Hussey and Steve Smith took Australia to 262/6.\nThe Zimbabwean reply was disappointing, as the Australian pace trio of Brett Lee, Shaun Tait and Mitchell Johnson reduced Zimbabwe to 44/4. The Zimabweans had some small partnerships going; but that was little resistance as they were all out of 171, with Johnson getting 4 wickets.\nAustralian captain Ricky Ponting was handed down a Level 1 charge by the ICC, after he damaged a television set in the dressing room following his run-out.\nKenya vs Pakistan.\nPakistan, who were on a poor run of form before this World Cup faced off against Kenya. Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi won the toss and elected to bat first but it was the Kenyan bowlers who struck early, getting opens Mohammad Hafeez and Ahmed Shehzad out early on, leaving Pakistan at 12/2 at the end of 7 overs. Kamran Akmal and Younis Khan then began a rebuilding partnership of 98, until Kamran fell shortly after reaching his half-century. Younis also reached a half-century and fell immediately, before Misbah-ul-Haq and Umar Akmal hit a rapid 118-run partnership, with the latter especially being severe on the bowlers in his 71 off 52 balls. Both men fell towards the end of the innings as Pakistan reached 317/7, helped quite substantially by the Kenyan bowling which conceded 46 extras.\nKenya started off solidly in their big chase, with openers Morris Ouma and Seren Waters adding 37 for the first wicket until a direct hit from Umar Akmal had the latter run out. The Kenyans fought during the first half of their innings, getting to 73/2 before Shahid Afridi bowled Steve Tikolo. He then ran through the lower middle order and the tail with ease, and ended up with figures of 5/16 from 8 overs as Kenya collapsed to 112 all out, with the only resistance offered by Collins Obuya's 47.\nAfridi took the best figures for a Pakistan bowler in the World Cup, with 5/16. Kenya bowled 37 wides, equaling the record set by the West Indies, also against Pakistan, in 1989.\nAustralia vs New Zealand.\nNew Zealand and Australia and both won their first games easily, and now the Tasman neighbours faced off against each other where the winner would get two wins out of two. Australian captain Ricky Ponting won the toss and asked New Zealand to bat. Opener Brendon McCullum blazed away at the start of the innings until Shaun Tait had him caught at third man. New Zealand progressed at a steady run rate after that, reaching 66/2 for after 13 overs until Tait and Mitchell Johnson unleashed a good spell of bowling which resulted in a collapse of 4 wickets for 7 runs. New Zealand showed resistance after that as Nathan McCullum scored a half-century, and Daniel Vettori a quick 44, which allowed them to get 206.\nAustralia started rapidly in their chase thanks to Brad Haddin, who went a well over a run a ball right from the start and quickly reached his half-century. Shane Watson was quiet in the opening phase but soon got into the stride, and Australia reached 100 in just 14 overs. Watson didn't take too much longer to reach his half-century either, and although Hamish Bennett offered New Zealand a ray of hope by getting Watson and Haddin out in the same over, Michael Clarke and Cameron White guided Australia hope with ease within 34 overs, with 7 wickets to spare.\nAustralian batsman Michael Clarke reached 6,000 One Day International runs in his 174 innings during this match. This match was used to decide the annual Chappell–Hadlee Trophy for the 2010–11 season, as Australia and New Zealand did not play any other ODIs against each other during the season.\nPakistan vs Sri Lanka.\nPakistan captain Shahid Afridi won the toss and decided to bat first against Sri Lanka, one of the pre-tournament favorites. Sri Lanka got the wicket of Ahmed Shehzad in the sixth over, but Pakistan still managed to proceed along at a rapid run rate in the first ten overs. Mohammed Hafeez, Pakistan's other opener proceeded along at over a run a ball until a mix up with Kamran Akmal had him run out, and Kamran himself was stumped a few overs later to leave the match evenly poised at 105/3 in the 21st over. Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq then built a 104 run partnership in 20 overs without taking too many risks, until Younis fell to Rangana Herath for 72 while trying to accelerate. Misbah stayed not out till the end for a well made 83, but Sri Lanka got the wickets of Umar Akmal and Abdul Razzaq cheaply, and Shahid Afridi before he did too much damage to the score to keep Pakistan to 277/7.\nSri Lanka started off with a very good reply, with their openers Upul Tharanga and Tillakaratne Dilshan accelerating steadily after a slow start to add 76 in just over 14 overs until Hafeez had Tharanga caught at point. This was the turning point of the match, as three more wickets, including that of Dilshan fell soon after to leave Sri Lanka tottering at 96/4. Kumar Sangakkara rode his luck with Kamran missing two stumpings off him, and staged a recovery with Chamara Silva, but his luck eventually ran out as the required run rate went up, with Afridi having him caught at long on one short of his fifty. Silva struggled to time the ball early in his innings, being 16 off 49 balls at one point, but he then accelerated rapidly to reach his half-century, but Afridi returned to remove dangerous looking Angelo Mathews. Silva eventually fell for 57 when Kamran did get a stumping right, and despite Nuwan Kulasekara's cameo, Sri Lanka ended up 11 short.\nPakistani all-rounder Shahid Afridi took his 300th ODI wicket during this match. The defeat was the first home loss for Sri Lanka in World Cup matches.\nZimbabwe vs Canada.\nZimbabwe's victory was their fourth biggest by runs margin in ODI cricket, and their biggest in World Cups. Canadian opening batsman, Nitish Kumar, became the youngest ever player in World Cup cricket, aged 16 years and 283 days.\nSri Lanka vs Kenya.\nSri Lankan fast bowler Lasith Malinga took a hat-trick, the second in his career. He became the first bowler to take two World Cup hat-tricks, and the fourth bowler to take two career ODI hat-tricks.\nCanada vs Pakistan.\nShahid Afridi, who was named man of the match, set a new record of becoming the first player in World Cup matches to take four or more wickets in three consecutive games.\nNew Zealand vs Zimbabwe.\nMartin Guptill and Brendon McCullum set a new record of the highest opening partnership for New Zealand in World Cup matches.\nSri Lanka vs Australia.\nThe no-result ended Australia's World Cup winning streak at 25; Australia had won every World Cup game it had played since the tied semi-final against South Africa in the 1999 Cricket World Cup. Australia's unbeaten run in World Cup matches was not broken, and was extended to 32.\nKenya vs Canada.\nCanada's win was their third-successive victory against Kenya and their second win in World Cup matches. They had previously beaten Bangladesh in the 2003 Cricket World Cup.\nNew Zealand vs Pakistan.\nNew Zealand batted first, making a slow start. At the half-way point, they were 99/2, 163/4 at the 40 over mark and 210/6 by the 46th over. Ross Taylor and Jacob Oram then added 85 more runs from 22 balls. Taylor, playing on his birthday, finished unbeaten on 131 from 124 balls. He survived two early chances, edging a ball from Shoaib Akhtar before scoring. In the same over, he edged another one to Kamran Akmal which wasn't taken. New Zealand added 139 runs in the final ten overs, with 100 of them coming from the final five. Taylor scored 62 runs off the last 16 deliveries he faced, including seven sixes. In reply, Pakistan were bowled out for 192 from 41.1 overs. The match was the first ODI game to be played at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium, Kandy. After the match, Taylor admitted that he'd played with a broken bat. \"I cracked it in the nets a couple of days ago\", he said. \"It seemed to go OK today but hopefully the new one can be just as good.\"\nSri Lanka vs Zimbabwe.\nUpul Tharanga and Tillakaratne Dilshan set a new World Cup record for the opening partnership, scoring 282 runs, beating the previous record of 194. It was also the first occasion in a World Cup that both openers made a century. With their victory over Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka became the first team to qualify for the Quarter Finals of the tournament. In reply, Zimbabwe made a good start, but were dismissed for 188 runs with 11 overs spare.\nAustralia vs Kenya.\nKenya's total of 264 is their highest score in World Cup matches, beating their previous best of 254 against Sri Lanka in the 1996 Cricket World Cup.\nAustralia vs Pakistan.\nThe loss was Australia's first loss in a World Cup match since 23 May 1999, when Pakistan defeated Australia at Headingley in the group stage of the 1999 World Cup. This ended a 34-match unbeaten streak (including 32 wins, a tie and a no-result)."

He won the Western Pennsylvania State Championship with Homestead in 1900 and 1901. Then in 1902, he brought along many former Homestead players to the Stars team, which was formed by the former Latrobe Athletic Association manager, Dave Berry, and probably funded by the Barney Dreyfuss and William Chase Temple of the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team. During the Stars \"championship game\" against the Philadelphia Athletics, Willis scored an extra point to help lead the Stars to an 11–0 victory and the 1902 championship.\nPrior to playing professionally, Richardson played at the college level for Brown University. While at Brown he was a two-time All-American on Walter Camps second team. He is best known as the player who kicked Brown’s first ever field goal in 1899. In 1898 he earned his first All-American status by running 103 yards for a touchdown against Princeton.\nIn 1971 Willis was inducted into the Brown University Football Hall of Fame."

        "title": "2009–10 Kentucky Wildcats women's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2009–10 Kentucky Wildcats women's basketball team represented the University of Kentucky in the 2009–10 NCAA Division I women's basketball season. The Wildcats, coached by Matthew Mitchell, are a member of the Southeastern Conference, and play their home games on campus at Memorial Coliseum—unlike UK's famous men's program, which plays off-campus at Rupp Arena in downtown Lexington.\nThe Wildcats had arguably the most successful season in the program's history, setting school records for most wins, most home wins, most conference wins, most consecutive conference wins, best start to a season, and highest finish in conference play. The season culminated in a deep run in the NCAA tournament that saw them appear in their first regional final since the inaugural NCAA tournament in 1982, when the then-Lady Kats lost in the Midwest Regional final to Louisiana Tech. This Wildcats team lost 88–68 to Oklahoma in the final of the Kansas City Regional.\nPreseason outlook.\nThe Wildcats returned three starters from a team that had an injury-plagued 2008–09 season, finishing 16–16 and 5–9 in SEC play, ending in a second-round exit to Wisconsin in the WNIT. However, the team returned very little in the way of height—none of the returning players were taller than 6'1\" (1.85 m).\nThe team received no respect from regional or national media prior to the 2009–10 season. The Cats were picked 11th of 12 teams in the conference by the media, and none of their players was named to either the first or second team on the media's preseason All-SEC team. The league's coaches gave no more respect to the team, also picking them 11th in the conference, but did name junior forward Victoria Dunlap to their preseason All-SEC second team.\nThe Wildcats were displeased at their preseason ranking; during the SEC's preseason media day, Dunlap told the assembled journalists,\n2009–10 roster.\nFrom the official UK women's basketball site:\n2009–10 schedule.\n!colspan=9| Exhibition\n!colspan=9| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9| SEC regular season\n!colspan=9| 2010 SEC tournament\n \n!colspan=9| 2010 NCAA tournament\n \n \nAll attendance figures are from official box scores available at the official UK women's basketball site.\nRegular season notes.\nThe regular season proved to be a season of milestones for the Wildcats, beginning with the best start in the program's history. UK's previous best start had been 9–0 in the 1980–81 season; they broke that record with a 101–67 pasting of Louisville on December 20 in which they forced a then school-record 38 turnovers. They reached 11–0 before their first loss at Middle Tennessee.\nIn SEC play, the Cats had never won more than four conference games in a row, with the last time being in 2005–06. They broke that record with a win at Mississippi State in which they also surpassed their SEC win total from 2008 to 2009. The Wildcats eventually stretched their record conference winning streak to eight.\nWith a win over South Carolina on February 21, 2010, the Wildcats completed an undefeated home season, the second in school history, and also set a school record for SEC wins in a season. However, they entered the SEC tournament on a down note, as they lost their final two regular-season games, both on the road.\nThe Wildcats' success has been heavily fueled by defense. Including their three SEC Tournament games, they have forced double-digit turnovers in every one of their 32 games, and have forced 20 or more in 24 of these games. As of the SEC final game, they were 4th nationally in turnover margin, averaging 7.59 more than their opposition. They were also in the top 25 nationally in scoring (73.9 per game), scoring margin (15.8), and steals (11.4).\nPostseason.\nSEC Tournament.\nWith their second-place finish in the regular season, the Wildcats earned a first-round bye and also were bracketed away from regular-season champion Tennessee.\nThey began their SEC tournament on March 5 with a rematch of their regular-season finale against Auburn, who had beaten the Wildcats in Auburn five days earlier. The Cats' two leading scorers on the season, Victoria Dunlap and A'dia Mathies, respectively scored 24 and 15 points, and the team forced the Tigers into 20 turnovers as they won 65–54.\nNext up for the Cats were third seed Mississippi State, whom they had beaten in their only previous meeting this season, also on the road. This time out, Kentucky started poorly, shooting less than 30% from the field in the first half and ending the first half down by 11. The deficit went up to 14 early in the second half before Mathies and fellow guard Amber Smith exploded, respectively scoring 18 and 11 in the half as the Cats shot 51.5% from the floor. The Lady Bulldogs were slowed in the second half by turnovers and foul trouble; all of their starters ended the game with four fouls. The Cats won 76–65, with Mathies leading the scoring with 25 points and Dunlap adding 22 to go with 9 rebounds, 5 blocks, and 5 steals. The result sent the Wildcats to the SEC title game for only the second time in the program's history, with the only other appearance coming in 1982. It also gave the Cats 25 wins on the season, tying the UK record set by their 1980–81 team.\nThe Wildcats then played their expected opponent, top seed and #4-ranked Tennessee, on March 7. The teams had a recent history, as the Lady Vols had clinched the SEC regular-season title on February 25 with an 81–65 home win over the Cats. This encounter, in front of a nominally neutral though mostly partisan Tennessee crowd, proved considerably closer. The Wildcats remained in contention for most of the game, even opening up a four-point lead early in the second half and tied at 50 with 10 minutes remaining. However, the Lady Vols then went on an 11–3 run and never looked back, winning 70–62. This was Tennessee's first sweep of the SEC regular-season and tournament titles since 2000.\nNCAA basketball tournament.\nKentucky was seeded #4 in the Kansas City Region of the 2010 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament, their seventh appearance in that tournament. This marked Kentucky's first NCAA tournament appearance since 2006, and the Cats' highest seed since 1983.\nThe Wildcats' first-round game was against #13 seed Liberty at Freedom Hall in Louisville, Kentucky. The Lady Flames, making their 13th NCAA tournament appearance in the last 14 seasons, started strongly, scoring the first six points and taking a quick 8-point lead. The Cats then went on a 17–0 run to take back the lead, only to see the Lady Flames go on an 11–0 run of their own and take a 35–33 halftime lead. The second half was nearly as close, but Kentucky took the lead for good with 12 minutes left, and in the final 10 minutes Liberty could get no closer than the Wildcats' final 83–77 margin.\nKentucky was outrebounded 38–26 and outscored 54–30 in the paint. They made up for this with defense, forcing 22 turnovers, and free throws, outscoring the Lady Flames by 11 from the stripe. A'dia Mathies led the Cats with a career-high 32 points, which was also a record for a Kentucky player in NCAA tournament play. Victoria Dunlap and Keyla Snowden had 15 points each, with all of Snowden's scoring coming in the second half. The Cats' win was their 26th of the season, setting a new record for the program.\nNext up for Kentucky in Freedom Hall was #5 seed Michigan State, in what was touted as a clash of styles between the undersized Cats and the bigger, though slightly slower, Spartans. The size mismatch was most obvious inside, where the 6'1\" (1.85 m) Dunlap was matched against the 6'9\" (2.06 m) Allyssa DeHaan. Dunlap was suffering from an upset stomach and was given an IV before the game, and also suffered a minor ankle injury in the first half. However, she apparently felt little effect, as she shot 9 for 13 from the field and led the Cats with 21 points and 8 rebounds.\nThe first half was largely a back-and-forth affair, with Kentucky taking a 35–31 halftime lead after holding Michigan State without a field goal for the last 6½ minutes. The Wildcats then went on a 24–6 run in the second half to take command of the game, ultimately winning 70–52. The Kentucky defense forced 18 turnovers and held the Spartans to under 35% shooting from the field, and also held the Spartans to their lowest point total in NCAA tournament play. The win sent Kentucky into the regional semifinals for the first time since 1982.\nThe victory earned the Cats a trip to Kansas City and a date with top seed Nebraska, another team having its best season ever. The Cornhuskers' only loss going into the game was in the semifinals of the Big 12 Tournament to Texas A&amp;M, and they would have a partisan crowd on their side, as Kansas City is about a 3-hour drive from the school's campus.\nThis time, it was the Wildcats who took control of the game almost from the start, going on an early 12–4 run and stretching their lead to double digits late in the first half. They went into the locker room with a 43–34 lead, and then started the second half on an 11–1 run to take control of the game. While the Huskers made a late comeback while three Kentucky guards had four fouls, the Cats held on for a 76–67 upset win. Mathies led the Cats with 21 points, with Dunlap adding 18 plus 7 rebounds and Snowden scoring 13. While both teams had 16 turnovers, most of Kentucky's came late in the game. The Cats also outrebounded the bigger Huskers 36–25. The result sent Kentucky into its first regional final since 1982.\nThe regional final against Oklahoma opened as a repeat of the Nebraska game, with the Cats opening up a double-digit lead before the Sooners scored a basket and extending their lead to 17–4. However, Oklahoma quickly came back, taking its first lead with 7:41 left in the first half and going into halftime up 43–39. The second half belonged to the Sooners, who opened the half with a 15–5 run and later went on an 11–0 run to put the game out of reach, ultimately winning 88–68. The Wildcats shot only 23.1% from the floor in the second half, and were 2-for-17 from three-point range in the game. The only Wildcat to score in double figures was Dunlap, who had 31 points and 13 rebounds.\nAwards and honors.\nThe conference's postseason awards announcement, made immediately after the end of the regular season, became a Kentucky coronation.\nMatthew Mitchell, after leading the Cats to an all-time best of 11–5 in SEC play, was named the SEC Coach of the Year. He became only the second UK women's coach to win this award.\nVictoria Dunlap became the first UK woman to be named SEC Player of the Year and the first to be named an Associated Press All-American. She was the only player in the conference to finish the regular season in the conference's top five in both scoring (17.2 per game) and rebounding (8.4 per game). Dunlap also led the SEC in steals and finished in the top 10 of four other SEC statistical categories. She was a unanimous selection to the All-SEC first team, becoming the first Wildcat to make the first team since Stacey Reed in 1993–94. Dunlap also made the SEC All-Defensive team, the AP All-America third team (the first woman from UK selected as an All-American by the AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association All-America team, and the State Farm Coaches' All-America team.\nA'dia Mathies was named SEC Freshman of the Year, becoming the first UK woman to receive this honor. Second on the Wildcats to Dunlap in almost all key statistical categories, she was also named to the All-SEC second team.\nThe Wildcats became the first SEC women's team to sweep all three major conference honors (coach, player, and freshman of the year) since the unbeaten national champion 1997–98 Tennessee team; that team respectively claimed the top SEC honors with Pat Summitt, Chamique Holdsclaw, and Tamika Catchings.\nClass of 2010 commitments.\nOn November 18, 2009, head coach Matthew Mitchell signed five high school players during the fall signing period, and received a Top-10 national ranking by two recruiting services. The class was ranked No. 5 by Blue Star Basketball and No. 10 by ESPN HoopGurlz. It marks the highest-ranking class for the Wildcats since 2006. The Class of 2010 signees are: McDonald's All-American Jennifer O'Neill, 2010 Gatorade Kentucky Player of the Year and Miss Kentucky Basketball Sarah Beth Barnette, 2010 Gatorade Connecticut Player of the Year Kastine Evans, Maegan Conwright, and LaQuinta Jefferson."

        "text": "David J. Berry (May 1870 – November 10, 1928) was an American football manager during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was the top promoter for the sport during that time period. He is credited with inventing the \"all-star game concept\" in 1898, and also helped to form one of the first organized football leagues in 1902.\nLatrobe.\nHe was the manager of the Latrobe Athletic Association the first ever fully professional football team to play an entire season. He was also signed John Brallier to the Latrobe football team in 1895, for $10 a game plus expenses, making him the first-ever openly professional football player. Outside of pro football, Berry was the editor of the \"Latrobe Clipper\" newspaper.\nAll-Star game.\nBerry was also the inventor of the all-star game. In 1898, Berry organized a team of local stars to play the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club, the Pennsylvania \"football champions\" that season. He came up with the idea of opposing them with an all-star team culled from Latrobe, Greensburg Athletic Association, Washington &amp; Jefferson College, the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, and Pittsburgh College of the Holy Ghost. Berry was able to form the 1898 Western Pennsylvania All-Star football team, however Greensburg and Washington &amp; Jefferson refused to commit players, or allow them to play. Many of his players came directly from Latrobe. Still Berry's All-Star Game ended in a 16–0 Duquesne win. The game also resulted in a poor showing of attendance, with only 1,500 fans in attendance at Pittsburgh's Exposition Park. Part of the blame was due to many Pittsburghers considering the football season over with the Thanksgiving games. Uncertain weather was also blamed for the poor attendance. However most of the fans blame went to the leaders of the Greensburg Athletic Association, who were accused of spreading rumors that the various star players would not appear in the game.\nHours before the start of his all-star game, Berry was \"arrested\" by one of his Latrobe players for a debt he claimed Berry owed him. Berry paid the $33 owed and then had the player arrested on false arrest charges.\nNFL (1902).\nBerry also helped form the first National Football League in 1902, with Ben Shibe and John Rogers. Shibe and Rodgers, owners of the Philadelphia Phillies and Philadelphia Athletics respectively, decided to field football teams to compete with each other during the baseball wars, that pitted the National League against the upstart American League. However both men needed to have a Pittsburgh-based team in their football league to add legitimacy to their league. So they contacted Berry who put together an all-star team of top players that were named the \"Pittsburgh Stars\". The Stars were owned by Berry on paper; however Barney Dreyfuss and William Chase Temple, owners of the Pittsburgh Pirates were rumoured to be funding the team. Meanwhile, Shibe and Rogers named their teams after their baseball counterparts. Berry was also named the league's president.\nIn the league's only season, Berry's Pittsburgh Stars defeated the Philadelphia Athletics, 11-0 at the Pittsburgh Coliseum to win the league championship. The A's players decided to call the Stars game an exhibition, and declared themselves the champs. However, the team had agreed to that season-ending championship game against Pittsburgh the Saturday after Thanksgiving Day, and they had lost it. This was recognized by all parties at the time as the championship game. Each team carried a record of 2–2 for league play. Pittsburgh had by far the better point ratio, scoring 39 points to their opponents' 22. Both the Athletics and the Phillies gave up more points than they scored in their league games. Finally Berry used his power as league president and name his Stars the 1902 champions.\nNewspaper career.\nBerry was a longtime newspaperman. He learned the business as a reporter for the daily \"Greensburg Press\", covering the city of Jeannette in the local news. He later conducted the \"Latrobe Clipper\" and founded two papers in Greensburg, the \"Morning Star\" and \"Morning Review\". Continuing his journalistic career in Uniontown, he purchased the weekly \"Genius of Liberty\" and daily \"Evening Genius\" and established the \"Morning Herald\". During the later years of his life he turned his attention to labor publications, editing the \"National Labor Journal\" of Pittsburgh and the \"National Industrial Review\" of San Francisco."

        "text": "The men's pommel horse competition was one of eight events for male competitors in artistic gymnastics at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. It was held from 3 to 7 December at the Melbourne Festival Hall. There were 63 competitors from 18 nations (down sharply from the 185 gymnasts in 1952), with nations in the team competition having up to 6 gymnasts and other nations entering up to 3 gymnasts. The event was won by Boris Shakhlin of the Soviet Union, the nation's second consecutive victory in the pommel horse. Takashi Ono earned Japan's first medal in the event with his silver. Soviet Viktor Chukarin became the first man to win multiple medals in the pommel horse, adding a bronze to his 1952 gold.\nBackground.\nThis was the ninth appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Two of the top 10 gymnasts from 1952 returned: gold medalist Viktor Chukarin of the Soviet Union and sixth-place finisher Hans Sauter of Austria. Reigning world champion and Olympic silver medalist Hrant Shahinyan of the Soviet Union did not compete; Chukarin at third place in the worlds was the highest placed gymnast to come to Melbourne.\nAustralia and Canada each made their debut in the men's pommel horse; East and West Germany competed together as the United Team of Germany for the first time. The United States made its eighth appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics format continued to use the aggregation format, mostly following the scoring tweaks made in 1952. Each nation entered either a team of six gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The 2 exercise scores were summed to give an apparatus total. No separate finals were contested.\nExercise scores ranged from 0 to 10 and apparatus scores from 0 to 20."

They lost all ten county matches and their only victory was against MCC. Partly in response to this the club created as an offshoot the football club Derby County F.C. in 1884.\n1884 cricket season.\nDerbyshire played ten county matches, one against the touring Australians and one against MCC. Ludford Docker was captain for his only season. In a sparse season without any centuries, Frank Sugg was top scorer. William Cropper and Joseph Marlow shared most wickets with 34 each.\nThe season was marked by the arrival of the two Sugg brothers from Yorkshire - Frank and Walter. Frank moved to Lancashire CCC after three years, but Walter had a long career with Derbyshire. Frank Shacklock played the first of two seasons for the club. Cricket poet Alfred Cochrane made his debut, sharing his appearances with Oxford University over the following years. Joseph Chatterton, younger brother of William, played the first of three seasons. William Shipton played one match but only played for the county again when they were without first class status. Matthew Burrows played his one career match during the season.\nThe season saw the retirement of two originals of the first Derbyshire side in 1871 - Robert Smith and John Platts. Platts returned to the sport as an umpire. Two other long-timers also left - Thomas Foster first played in 1873. He was running a pub and later returned to umpire. Henry Shaw had joined in 1875.\nStatistics.\nFirst-class batting averages.\nA number of additional players appeared in the matches against Staffordshire. Apart from William Delacombe and Ralph Docker none of these players appeared in any first class matches for Derbyshire. These players were CC Marshall, Haydn Morley, WB Woodforde, A Jourdain, William Turnley, F C Newton, D Bostock, Johnstone and Giffard.\nDerby County Football Club.\nDerby County F.C. was formed in 1884 as an offshoot of the cricket club in an attempt to give players and supporters a winter interest as well as secure the cricket club extra revenue. The original intention was to name the club \"Derbyshire County F.C.\" to highlight the link, though the Derbyshire FA, formed in 1883, objected on the grounds it was too long and therefore would not have been understood by the fans. Playing their home matches at the cricket club's Racecourse Ground, 1884/85 saw the club undertake an extensive programme of friendly matches, the first of which was a 6–0 defeat to Great Lever on 13 September 1884. The club's first competitive match came in the 1885 FA Cup, where they lost 7–0 at home to Walsall Town."

The object of a flèche is to ride the maximum distance in a fixed time, usually 24 hours, and usually finishing at or near a specified location, riding a route that the team has specified before the start; different teams generally do not have to follow the same route. Teams usually comprise up to five riders, of which three must finish in order to complete the flèche; the usual minimum distance is 360 km. Flèche competitions traditionally take place on or about the Easter holiday.\nThe flèche event can also be run in a completely non-competitive manner, such as the FLÈCHE Northern CALIFORNIA.\nBackground.\nThe word \"flèche\" is French, meaning \"arrow\".

The event has been steadily gaining popularity in Asian, American and European cities and countries over the past decade. Bike Week has been running in the UK since 1923. \nBike Week typically takes place in the summer, and runs in the UK during the second week of June, following just after the international World Bicycle Day on June 3rd. Celebrities that have taken part in the past include Fearne Cotton, Olivia Williams, and Jeremy Vine.\nUK and Ireland.\nBike Week, organized by Cycling UK, is an annual celebration to showcase cycling. Bike Week takes place during the second week of June in the United Kingdom, with a parallel event in Ireland called National Bike Week. In 2019, Bike Week ran from Saturday, June 8 to Sunday, June 16.\nThe concept of Bike Week is \"everyday cycling for everyone\" and aims to encourage those who wouldn't normally cycle to get on their bikes. Any outing on a bike counts – whether that’s nipping around to a friend's house, cycling to work or school, enjoying a leisurely ride with the family, or tackling a cycling challenge.\nEvery year around 500 events are registered as part of Bike Week, such as family-friendly rides, bike maintenance events, bike breakfasts and group rides, to name but a few. Around 300,000 extra people choose to take part every year, on top of the 2.4 million who already cycle regularly in the UK.\nA social media campaign runs through Bike Week called the #7DaysofCycling focusing on different cycling experiences and encouraging everyone to talk about their experiences and raise awareness of the benefits of cycling. Each day has a different theme, from cycling to work to the benefits of cycling on mental health. \nBike Week is traditionally launched with the annual APPCG bike ride through London, where MPs, peers, and influential members of the cycling industry attend a reception before riding through London. In 2019 this included the inaugural Bike Week summit which was attended by the transport minister Michael Ellis. \nUnited States.\nIn the United States of America, May is recognized as Bike Month, and Bike to Work Week is always either the first or second full week of May. Austin, Boston, Pasadena, Portland, Roseville, Santa Barbara, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, and Washington are among the US cities that actively participate.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, Bike Week occurs in either May or June because Bike Month is typically from 25 May to 25 June. Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Ottawa, Victoria and Halifax are among the cities that participated in 2009. Vancouver participates every year."

Kent represented England on six occasions and in 1888 he was chosen to tour New Zealand and Australia as part of the first British Isles team.\nRugby career.\nKent played the majority of his first class rugby for Salford, representing the club while chosen for the British Isles in 1888 and four years later when he was selected for England, he was still a Salford player. Kent's most notable period as a rugby player was when he was invited to join the first British overseas touring team in 1888. The tour took in 35 matches against representative teams from New Zealand and Australia, but as the touring party was not recognised by any official rugby union the club they did not face any national sides and no caps were awarded. Kent played in 28 matches, scoring five tries and a single conversion.\nOn his return to Britain, Kent was still unable to break into the England national team. It took until the 1891 Home Nations Championship to be selected to play for England; his first match being against Wales played away at Newport. After a 7-3 win, Kent was reselected for the very next game to Ireland, England winning easily. With two wins in the Championship, the final game for England, against Scotland set up the Championship decider. When Scotland won, a promising England campaign fell apart, and the press reacted angrily, stating the season was the worst since 1871.\nDespite the disappointing end to the 1891 season, Kent was back in the England squad for the 1892 Home Nations Championship. The tournament was an incredible success for England, not only winning all three matches, and thus taking the Championship and the Triple Crown; but also finished the season without conceding a single point. Seven players kept their places throughout the tournament for England, Kent being one of them. As a Triple crown winner, Kent finished his international career at the highest level.\nChange of Code.\nWhen Salford converted from the rugby union code to the rugby league code on 2 June 1896, Tom Kent would have been approximately 31 years of age. Consequently, he may have been both a rugby union and rugby league footballer for Salford."

It was held from 3 to 7 December at the Melbourne Festival Hall. There were 63 competitors from 18 nations (down sharply from the 185 gymnasts in 1952), with nations in the team competition having up to 6 gymnasts and other nations entering up to 3 gymnasts. The event was won by Viktor Chukarin of the Soviet Union, the nation's first victory in the parallel bars. Japan took three medals: a silver by Masumi Kubota and bronzes by Takashi Ono and Masao Takemoto. It was the third time a nation had won three medals in the event in the same Games: the United States had swept the medals in 1904 and Switzerland had earned a gold and two bronzes in 1948. Chukarin was the third man to win multiple medals in the parallel bars; Ono would become the fourth in 1960.\nBackground.\nThis was the ninth appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Three of the top 10 gymnasts from 1952 returned: silver medalist Viktor Chukarin of the Soviet Union, fifth-place finisher Ferdinand Daniš of Czechoslovakia, and eighth-place finisher Valentin Muratov of the Soviet Union. Chukarin (the 1952 Olympic all-around champion) had won the 1954 world championships.\nAustralia and Canada each made their debut in the men's parallel bars; East and West Germany competed together as the United Team of Germany for the first time. The United States made its eighth appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics format continued to use the aggregation format, mostly following the scoring tweaks made in 1952. Each nation entered either a team of six gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The 2 exercise scores were summed to give an apparatus total. No separate finals were contested.\nExercise scores ranged from 0 to 10 and apparatus scores from 0 to 20."

In the first two tournaments, the title was decided alone on group stages. From 1968 until now, the group stage was followed by a knock-out stage. The tournament has been held annually since 1984.\nHowever, 2005 IBSF World Snooker Championship was cancelled, due to an earthquake in Pakistan where the event was due to be held. Instead in February/March 2006, a new tournament with the name IBSF World Grand Prix was held in Prestatyn, Wales as the qualification for a place on 2006/2007 World Snooker Main Tour, although the winner wasn't called World Champion.\nIn 2007 an all-Thailand final saw Atthasit Mahitthi defeat Passakorn Suwannawat 11–7. At the 2008 championship in Wels, Austria, Thepchaiya Un-Nooh of Thailand defeated Ireland's Colm Gilcreest 11–7. The 2009 event was held in Hyderabad, India, and won by Alfie Burden of England, 10–8 against Igor Figueiredo of Brazil.

        "text": "Steven John Wagner (born April 18, 1954) is a former professional American football defensive back in the National Football League (NFL). He played four seasons for the Green Bay Packers (1976–1979) and one for the Philadelphia Eagles (1980). Wagner graduated from Oconomowoc High School before attending the University of Wisconsin, where he played college football. He was a second-team all-Big Ten selection during his senior year at Wisconsin.\nWagner was drafted in the fifth round of the 1976 NFL Draft by the Minnesota Vikings. He missed out on a roster spot with the Vikings but ended up signing a contract with the Packers halfway through the 1976 NFL season. The \"Wisconsin State Journal\" noted that Wagner was a \"key member of the Packer specialty teams\" and recorded the most tackles (13 solo, 10 assisted) during punt and kick returns of any player on the Packers during the 1977 NFL season. Prior to the 1980 NFL season, Wagner was waived by the Packers and then signed by the Eagles. After playing for the Eagles during the preseason, he was waived again and returned home to work as a salesman for his father's electronics business. However, the Eagles ended up signing Wagner near the end of the season due to injuries to other players. Over a five year career with the Packers and Eagles, Wagner played in 61 games, recording 14 kick returns for 181 yards, while also recovering three fumbles. He never started a game in his NFL career."

        "text": "Larry Porter (born April 28, 1972) is an American college football coach. He currently serves as special teams coordinator and running backs coach and at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Porter is a former head coach of the Memphis Tigers football team. He was named to the position on November 29, 2009, replacing Tommy West. A former running back for the school when it was known as Memphis State University, Porter was formerly an assistant head coach, chief recruiter, and running backs coach at Louisiana State University under Les Miles. On November 27, 2011, Porter was fired after completing a 2–10 season with only having won three games during his two-year tenure.\nPlaying career.\nPorter lettered four years (1990–93) at Memphis, serving as co-captain of the 1993 Tiger squad. He closed out his career with 2,194 yards and 20 rushing touchdowns, ranking seventh in school history in yardage and tied for fifth in touchdowns.\nAs a freshman in 1990, Porter rushed for 206 yards against Arkansas State University, the highest single-game total for a freshman in school history. In his first game, he replaced injured starting tailback Marvin Cox and raced 53 yards for a touchdown against Arkansas State on his first college carry. Porter had a total of six 100-yard games during his career, a figure that ranks tied for fifth in Memphis history. Porter graduated in 1996 with a bachelor's degree in education.\nCoaching career.\nPorter began his coaching career at Wooddale High School in Memphis, Tennessee, serving as head track and field coach, while assisting with the running backs and secondary on the football squad. After two years at Wooddale, Porter moved to the collegiate ranks, coaching the running backs at Tennessee-Martin in 1998.\nPorter then spent three years at Arkansas State, where he coached Jonathan Adams to back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons. Adams rushed for 1,004 yards and six touchdowns in 2000 and followed that with another 1,004 yards and five scores in 2001. Under Porter's tutelage, Adams capped his career as the second-leading rusher in Arkansas State history.\nIn 2002, Porter was hired by Oklahoma State coach Les Miles as Running Backs coach. At OSU, Porter's stable of running backs continued the tradition of \"Tailback U.\", as he coached 1,000-yard rushers for three straight seasons. In 2004, Vernand Morency earned second-team All-Big 12 honors after rushing for 1,474 yards, which ranked eighth in the nation, and 12 touchdowns. Morency was a third round pick of the Houston Texans in 2005.\nA year earlier, Tatum Bell earned first-team All-Big 12 honors with 1,286 yards and 16 touchdowns. Bell and Morency combined for 2,204 yards and 24 touchdowns for the Cowboys in 2003. Bell then went on to become a second round draft pick by the Denver Broncos in the 2004 NFL Draft. In his first season at OSU, Porter guided Bell to a 1,096-yard, 11-touchdown season for 8–5 Oklahoma State.\nIn 2005, Porter joined coach Miles at LSU. He has coached LSU running backs while also holding two key roles on staff – assistant head coach and chief recruiter. Porter was elevated to the position of assistant head coach during the spring of 2006. He was twice (2007 and 2009) named as the National Recruiter of the Year by Rivals.com making him one of the top all-around assistant coaches in college football.\nIn three of the last four seasons (2006–09 included), the LSU rushing unit has averaged over 165 yards a game, including a high of 214 yards per game in 2007. That squad closed out the season ranked 11th nationally in rushing. From 2005–08, the Tigers totaled 108 rushing touchdowns, including 35 in 2007.\nAs LSU's running backs coach, Porter has helped developed some of the finest players at that position in LSU's history. From 2005–08, LSU produced a 1,000-yard rusher twice – Jacob Hester 1,103 yards in 2007 and Charles Scott 1,174 yards in 2008 – as well as having two players (Hester and Joseph Addai) selected in the NFL Draft.\nIn 2008, LSU again had one of the top running games in the SEC as the Tigers rushed for 166.8 yards per game with Scott getting the bulk of the carries (1,174 yards on 217 attempts). Scott, who earned first-team All-SEC in 2008, and Keiland Williams (417 yards, 2 touchdowns on 83 attempts) gave the Tigers one of the top 1–2 rushing punches in the league last year.\nPorter and the Tigers had a running back-by-committee approach during the national championship season in 2007 with Hester leading all rushers with a career-best 1,103 yards and 11 touchdowns. Hester, who was a second-team All-SEC selection, had four 100-yard rushing games, including a 120-yard effort against Tennessee in the SEC Championship Game. Williams was second on the squad with 478 yards and six scores, while Trindon Holliday was third with 364 yards and two touchdowns.\nAs a unit, LSU rushed for 214.1 yards per game and 35 touchdowns. The 214.1 yards per game and 35 rushing touchdowns both ranked second in the SEC. Another impressive feat for the Tiger running backs was the fact that they combined for 432 carries in 2007 with just one lost fumble, which came against Tennessee in the SEC title game.\nFollowing the 2007 season, Hester was picked in the third round of the 2008 NFL Draft by the San Diego Chargers. Hester became the fourth running back coached by Porter that has been selected among the first three rounds of the NFL Draft since 2004.\nIn 2006, Porter juggled running backs as the Tigers started four players, including two true freshmen, at tailback. In 13 games, the Tigers had five running backs lead the team in rushing. Hester led the Tigers in rushing with 440 yards and six scores. Hester added another 269 yards and three touchdowns on 35 receptions, which ranked as the third-highest total for a running back in school history.\nA pair of true freshmen in Scott and Williams also burst onto the scene during the 2006 season, giving the Tigers a glimpse of the future as they combined for 713 yards and 10 touchdowns. Williams capped his first season with the Tigers in a big way, rushing for 107 yards and a pair of scores in LSU's 41–14 win over Notre Dame in the Sugar Bowl.\nAs a unit, the Tigers ranked second in the SEC in rushing in 2006 with 165.8 yards per game. The Tigers also had 25 rushing touchdowns, a figure that ranked No. 2 in the league.\nIn his first year with the team in 2005, Porter made an immediate impact on LSU's running game as the Tigers, despite losing perhaps the top runner in the SEC in Alley Broussard to a knee injury in mid-August, still managed to rush for 1,951 yards and 21 touchdowns. LSU's rushing offense ranked fourth in the SEC, while the 21 rushing touchdowns was the second-highest total in the league.\nAddai had his best year in a Tiger uniform, rushing for 911 yards and nine touchdowns; while Justin Vincent added 488 yards and five scores. Addai had five 100-yard rushing games, capped by a 130-yard, one-touchdown performance in LSU's 40–3 win over Miami in the Peach Bowl. He went on to become a first round draft pick of the Indianapolis Colts in the 2006 NFL Draft, becoming the first LSU running back taken in the first round of the NFL Draft since Harvey Williams was the 21st overall pick by the Chiefs in 1991. Addai was a finalist for NFL Rookie of the Year in 2006 and played a key role in the Colts' Super Bowl victory over the Chicago Bears.\nPorter took over the head coaching position at his alma mater, the University of Memphis, for the 2010 season. He was fired after the 2011 season after winning only three games over two seasons. \nOn February 10, it was announced that Porter would take the position of running backs coach at Arizona State University. The move comes after former coach Chris Thomsen left to coach the offensive line at Texas Tech University.\nOn January 1, 2013, Porter accepted the running backs coaching position at the University of Texas at Austin. On February 11, 2014, Porter was announced as the running backs coach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. On February 11, 2017, Porter was announced as tight ends and H-back coach and recruiting coordinator at Auburn University.\nOn January 29, 2021, Porter was announced as running backs coach at the University of North Carolina, returning for a second stint in Chapel Hill and reuniting with head coach Mack Brown, whom he had worked for at Texas for the 2013 season. Porter replaced Robert Gillespie, who left for Alabama. He was also given the title of assistant special teams coordinator, working with coordinator Jovan Dewitt. Following Dewitt's departure after the conclusion of the 2021 season, Porter was named the Tar Heels' special teams coordinator in addition to his responsibilities as running backs coach.\nPersonal.\nPorter and his wife Sharmane have three children, Brandon, Omari and Olivia."

The group consisted of host nation South Africa, Mexico, Uruguay and the runners-up from 2006, France.\nFrance and South Africa previously met at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, when then-hosts France beat South Africa 3–0. They also previously met with Uruguay at the 2002 FIFA World Cup; the match ended in a 0–0 draw. France and Mexico were in the same group at the first ever World Cup in 1930; the two nations played the first-ever World Cup match and France won 4–1. France and Mexico had also met in 1954 but neither team qualified for the next round. This is also the second time that France, Mexico and Uruguay have been drawn in the same group with the host nation. They were grouped with England in 1966, when England and Uruguay advanced to the next round.\nSouth Africa became the first World Cup host team to fail to advance past the group stage after finishing behind Mexico on goal difference. France, despite having made the final at the previous edition of the World Cup, were also eliminated after drawing one and losing two matches, including one against South Africa.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\n\"All times local ()\"\nSouth Africa vs Mexico.\nSouth Africa vs Mexico was the opening match of the World Cup, held on 11 June 2010. It was described as an \"enthralling\" and \"pulsating\" match. Mexico put the ball in the net first, but it was offside. South Africa opened the scoring in the 55th minute after Siphiwe Tshabalala scored off a pass through Mexico's defence by Kagiso Dikgacoi. Mexico's captain Rafael Márquez equalised following a corner kick in the 79th minute. In the final minutes of the match, Katlego Mphela almost scored a winning goal for South Africa, but his shot bounced off the post.\nTshabalala was named as the man of the match. South Africa's coach, Carlos Alberto Parreira called the result \"fair\", while Mexico's coach Javier Aguirre stated \"we could have won, we could have lost\".\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nUruguay vs France.\nFrance and Uruguay faced each other on 11 June 2010 at the Cape Town Stadium. Despite a red card being given to Uruguay substitute Nicolás Lodeiro in the second half, Uruguay were able to hold a \"lacklustre\" France to a 0–0 draw. After the match, former World Cup-winning French player Zinedine Zidane criticised the French team and particularly coach Raymond Domenech for a lack of teamwork. Domenech claimed after the match to be \"happy with the overall performance\".\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSouth Africa vs Uruguay.\nUruguay took the lead in the 24th minute, when Diego Forlán launched a shot from 30 yards out that beat goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune, who did not attempt to save the shot. In the second half, Luis Suárez was left through on goal, but he was brought down by Khune. Referee Massimo Busacca awarded a penalty and showed Khune a red card. Deep into injury time, Uruguay scored their third goal when Álvaro Pereira tapped in a Suárez cross.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nFrance vs Mexico.\nMexico's 2–0 victory over France in Polokwane was overshadowed by French striker Nicolas Anelka launching a tirade of abuse towards coach Raymond Domenech during the half-time interval. Anelka was subsequently dismissed from the squad, which resulted in many squad members, including captain Patrice Evra, boycotting training in the lead-up to the final group stage match against South Africa.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMexico vs Uruguay.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nFrance vs South Africa.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

The Ivory Coast finished third in the group and North Korea finished bottom. The North Koreans had a goal difference of −11, the worst of any team at the tournament, largely due to the 7–0 defeat they suffered against Portugal; that match was Portugal's biggest-ever World Cup win and North Korea's heaviest-ever defeat.

It was the third time that Argentina and Nigeria had been drawn together in the same World Cup group, after 1994 (when Greece were also in the same group) and 2002. Argentina had also been paired with South Korea in 1986.\nArgentina won all three of their matches, conceding just one goal, and progressed as group winners. South Korea joined them in the knockout stage by virtue of their victory over Greece in the opening match and a draw with Nigeria in the last. That point was the only one Nigeria won, having also lost to Greece in their second match.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\n\"All times local ()\"\nSouth Korea vs Greece.\nIn the seventh minute, Ki Sung-yong's free kick near the left corner was inadvertently flicked on by Kostas Katsouranis, before Lee Jung-soo rushed to the back post to open the scoring.

Lionel Messi had numerous chances for Argentina following that, but on each occasion, Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama was able to keep the margin down to one. Enyeama's saves earned him the man of the match award. Post-match, Argentina coach Diego Maradona said he was confident his side would perform well in the future.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nArgentina vs South Korea.\nArgentina took the lead when Lionel Messi's free kick from the left was turned into the Korean goal by Korean player Park Chu-young.

Two goals from Argentina in the second half sealed a 4–1 win. Messi's shot was first saved by goalkeeper Jung Sung-ryong; his second shot hit the post before Higuaín shot the ball into an unguarded net.

The team was coached by Lon Kruger, returning for his sixth year with the Runnin' Rebels. They played their home games at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center on UNLV's main campus in Paradise, Nevada and are a member of the Mountain West Conference. The Runnin' Rebels finished the season 25–9, 11–5 in MWC play. They advanced to the championship game of the 2010 Mountain West Conference men's basketball tournament before losing to San Diego State. They received an at–large bid to the 2010 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, earning an 8 seed in the Midwest Region, where they lost to 9 seed Northern Iowa in the first round.\nPreseason.\nRecruiting.\nCoach Lon Kruger signed a three-man class for 2008, including the #4 ranked prospect out of Nevada (#66 Rivals, #80 Scout, #85 ESPN), shooting guard Anthony Marshall of North Las Vegas, power forward Carlos Lopez of Henderson and shooting guard Justin Hawkins out of Woodland Hills, California. UNLV also signed power forward Quintrell Thomas, who transferred to UNLV from Kansas.\nSeason.\nNon-conference schedule.\nOn November 28, 2009, the team defeated #16 Louisville and became ranked nationally the following week. After defeating Arizona in double overtime, 74–72, on December 2, 2009, UNLV marked their first 6–0 start since the 1992–93 season and defeated Santa Clara on December 5 to move to 7–0, their best start since going 34–0 in 1990–91 and losing to Duke in the Final Four. UNLV would raise to #17/18 by the time they took on Kansas State on a neutral court at the Orleans Arena. As in the previous two games, UNLV's sloppy first half play allowed their opponent to jump to an early lead. Unlike in the games against Arizona and Santa Clara, UNLV was unable to move back in front and would lose their first game of the season, 95–80. UNLV's loss to Kansas State would drop them to #23 in the Coaches poll and knock them out of the AP poll all together. The Runnin' Rebels were able to rebound from the loss with a road win at Southern Utah, and home wins against Weber State and South Carolina – Upstate, before heading to Hawai'i for the inaugural Diamond Head Classic.\nThe Runnin' Rebels would enter the tournament only ranked in the coaches poll at #20. UNLV's first game of tournament would come against SMU. UNLV took control of the game quickly, sprinting out to an 18–4 lead within mere minutes of tip off and never looked back in a 67–53 victory. In the tournament's semifinal, the Rebels would face the tournament host, Hawai'i. Thanks to a relentless defense, UNLV was able to take Hawai'i out of the game early en route to a 77–53 victory, advancing UNLV to the Diamond Head Classic finals versus Southern California. UNLV's offensive might that had helped them to big early leads against SMU and Hawai'i was silenced by a tough USC defense. The Trojans were able to keep the Rebels at bay for most of the game and came away with the 67–56 win and the Diamond Head Classic title. The loss to Southern California would knock UNLV out of the Coaches poll.\nConference schedule.\nAfter eleven days off, UNLV began conference play against #23/25 BYU at the Marriott Center in Provo. Despite leading the Cougars for much of the game, including a six-point lead with less than six minutes to play. Late miscues would doom the Runnin' Rebels, leading to a 77–73 defeat to BYU. The following Saturday, UNLV would travel to The Pit to take on the #13/15 New Mexico Lobos. UNLV was able to keep the sell-out crowd of 14,586 quiet for most of the game, beginning by forcing New Mexico into two turnovers on their first two possessions of the game and jumping to a 9–2 lead. New Mexico would come back, taking over the lead twice in the game, but sophomore guard Kendall Wallace would pace the Rebels, going 7 of 10 on three-pointers as UNLV upset New Mexico 74–62. The Runnin' Rebels had their conference home opener against San Diego State, a team that swept UNLV in their three meetings the previous season. The first half of the game belonged to the bigger and athletically stacked SDSU, taking a 39–33 halftime lead. The Runnin' Rebels however, were able to take control in the second half and came away with a hard-fought 76–66 victory over their rival to improve to 2–1 in the Mountain West and 14–3 overall.\nHowever, thing soon went downhill as UNLV fell to Utah at home, 73–69. The Rebels rebounded and won in both Colorado State and TCU. Returning home, UNLV came from behind to beat Air Force, 60–50.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| Mountain West tournament\n!colspan=9 style=| NCAA tournament"

        "text": "Group C of the 2010 FIFA World Cup began on 12 June and ended on 23 June 2010. The group consisted of national association football teams from England, the United States, Algeria and Slovenia. The United States and England progressed to the round of 16 undefeated. The United States won the group, winning one match and drawing two. England had an identical record and goal difference but the United States finished top having scored more goals than England. Slovenia finished the group third having won a game, with Algeria finishing fourth with a single point.\nOnly England and the United States had previously met at a World Cup in 1950, when the United States defeated England 1–0. \nTeams.\nThe teams were decided by World Cup draw that took place on 4 December 2009. The group was set to receive one team from each pot, which sorted all World Cup teams by position on the FIFA World Rankings as of October 2009. \nThe first team drawn was England, which secured qualification as a pot one team by winning Group 6 of UEFA qualification. The United States finished top of the CONCACAF fourth round group. The pot 3 team was Algeria who qualified for the World Cup for the first time since 1986 thanks to a one-off play-off win against Egypt. The play-off tie was played in Khartoum after the two sides finished level with each other in Group C. Post-match, a diplomatic spat occurred between the two nations with Egypt later threatening to quit international football for two years due to the alleged behaviour of Algerian fans. There were also violent demonstrations in Cairo near the Algerian embassy. The final team was Slovenia who finished second in Group 3 of UEFA qualification, two points behind Slovakia. In the subsequent play-offs, Slovenia defeated Russia in a two-legged tie to qualify for the finals.\nEngland were considered favourites to win Group C. In a pre-tournament preview, The Guardian's Kevin McCarra analysed England's chances ahead of the tournament: \"If Wayne Rooney stayed fit, if Steven Gerrard got his form back and if the centre-backs were in rude health, England would present a severe problem to most. Capello needs to refresh a dynamism that has waned. Semi-finalists.\" The Guardian previewed the US' chances: \"The USA have been quietly optimistic about their chances of making a splash in South Africa ever since reaching the Confederations Cup final last year, where they lost to Brazil. They are confident of making it out of what is perceived to be a weak group and believe they can challenge England for first place.\"\nNotes\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\nMatches took place between 12 June and 23 June 2010. All times listed are local, .\nEngland vs United States.\nThe opening match of group C was contested between England and the United States. The two sides had previously played each other nine times with England winning on seven occasions and the United States on two. The teams had previously played each other once in the FIFA World Cup in 1950. The USA won 1–0 in one of the biggest World Cup shock results of all time. \nEngland took an early lead, Emile Heskey played a through ball to Steven Gerrard who slid the ball under Tim Howard in the 4th minute. However, the Three Lions failed to build on their lead, with the U.S. having plenty of possession in the first half. The United States equalised in the 40th minute when a seemingly harmless pot shot by Clint Dempsey was mishandled by England goalkeeper Robert Green and rolled into the net. Early in the second half, Heskey was played through on goal but could only shoot straight at Tim Howard. After several missed half-chances from England, Jozy Altidore forced a save onto the post from Green, highlighting England's lack of pace in central defence. Post-match, the U.S.' manager Bob Bradley was full of praise for his team's performance.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nAlgeria vs Slovenia.\nThe following day, Algeria met Slovenia in Polokwane. There were few chances created throughout the first half. However, in the 72nd minute, Algeria's substitute Abdelkader Ghezzal was dismissed for the accumulation of two yellow cards, the second being a handball. Seven minutes later, Slovenia's talisman Robert Koren scored the winning goal from 20 yards.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSlovenia vs United States.\nIn the second round of matches, Slovenia met the U.S. in Johannesburg. Slovenia went into half time with a 2–0 lead. Valter Birsa opened the scoring for Slovenia in an impressive fashion, collecting the ball from 25 yards out before curling the ball into the left-hand corner. After a dominant start from the Slovenians, the United States began to create some chances to equalise. However, on the counter-attack, Milivoje Novaković played a through ball to Zlatan Ljubijankić who managed to slot the ball under Tim Howard for their second goal. In response, the U.S.' manager made a double substitution at half time. In the opening stages of the second half, the United States halved the deficit via Landon Donovan after Boštjan Cesar had missed the flight of a long ball; Donovan then managed to collect the ball and hit his shot into the roof of the net from a tight angle. With eight minutes remaining, a long ball for the U.S. was knocked down by Joze Altidore to the oncoming Michael Bradley who finished past Samir Handanović on the half-volley to equalise the match at 2–2. The United States had looked as if they had won the match after a Donovan free-kick was turned in by Maurice Edu. However, the referee controversially disallowed the goal. Post-match, Bob Bradley said that he had no doubt that the referee had got the decision wrong.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nEngland vs Algeria.\nPrior to the match, England manager Fabio Capello took the decision to drop goalkeeper Rob Green following his high-profile error against the United States, replacing him with David James. Algeria also opted to change their goalkeeper with Raïs M'Bolhi replacing Faouzi Chaouchi. \nThe match finished goalless after few chances were created by either side and with Algeria often seeming more comfortable in possession. As England left the pitch, Wayne Rooney was heard on camera saying \"Nice to see your own fans booing you.\" which he later apologised for. Writing for \"Sky Sports\", James Dall described England's performance as unimaginative and nervy. \n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSlovenia vs England.\nJermain Defoe's 23rd-minute goal allowed England to claim the win and progress to the knockout stage of the competition. After the goal, England created several more chances but were unable to add to their lead.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nUnited States vs Algeria.\nEarly in the game, the United States nearly allowed another early goal as an Algerian shot hit the crossbar. Throughout the remainder of the game, the United States had a number of good chances against a solid Algerian defence that allowed just one goal from two games; striker Jozy Altidore volleyed wide of an open net, while Clint Dempsey had a goal disallowed for a controversial offside call and later hit the crossbar on a shot and missed an empty net on the rebound. After 90 minutes of a scoreless affair, the United States were at risk of elimination: with England leading Slovenia 1–0, a 0–0 draw for the United States would have caused them to finish third in Group C on three points (behind England on five and Slovenia on four). However, in stoppage time, American goalkeeper Tim Howard quickly threw an outlet pass to Landon Donovan, who moved the ball up the pitch and passed the ball just outside the box to Altidore, who then crossed the ball to an open Dempsey in the middle of the box. With the Algerian goalkeeper closing in, Dempsey shot quickly and was blocked; however, Donovan followed the shot and put the rebound into the net for an easy goal. The United States held on for the final few minutes for a 1–0 victory. The late goal not only saved the United States from elimination but also allowed them to win their group for the first time since 1930, advancing to play Ghana in the round of 16.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

None of these teams have previously met in a World Cup group stage.\nCameroon was the first team to be eliminated in the World Cup, following their 2–1 defeat by Denmark on 19 June 2010.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\n\"All times local ()\"\nNetherlands vs Denmark.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nJapan vs Cameroon.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nThe win for Japan was their first World Cup win away from home soil, and it was also the first time Cameroon was defeated in a World Cup opening match.\nNetherlands vs Japan.\nThe first clear chance of the game came from midfielder Wesley Sneijder when he shot over the bar from a long-range free-kick. When Japan broke up the Netherlands' passing, midfielder Daisuke Matsui was positive, helping a move that set Yuto Nagatomo up for a shot that he hit wide. The Netherlands became frustrated, as they struggled to incorporate forward Robin van Persie. Towards the end of the first half, Japan had two chances: defender Marcus Tulio Tanaka heading wide and Matsui with a powerful shot at the goalkeeper.\nThroughout the second half, Van Persie managed to break free twice. In the 52 minute, as the ball came into the penalty area, the Dutch number 9 moved the ball towards Sneijder, who shot the ball powerfully towards the goal, scoring via a deflection from the goalkeeper, Eiji Kawashima. Substitute Shunsuke Nakamura later managed to make a cross into the six-yard box, which was cleared by Van Persie. Dutch substitute Eljero Elia, managed to set up Ibrahim Afellay with a one-on-one with goalkeeper Kawashima, but Kawashima prevented him from scoring a goal. One minute before the end of the game, Shinji Okazaki missed a shot from ; shooting over the bar. Soon after this, Yuto Nagatomo went down in the penalty area claiming a penalty, from a challenge by Dutch Nigel de Jong, but the referee turned down his appeals.\nThe result was the Netherlands' second win in the competition, which meant that they would progress to the knockout stage if they did not lose their last match or Cameroon did not defeat Denmark. Cameroon would later on lose to Denmark, which meant that the Dutch were through and Cameroon were out after two matches.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nCameroon vs Denmark.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nDenmark vs Japan.\nJapan opened the scoring in the 17th minute from a direct free kick taken by Keisuke Honda – only the second goal scored from a free kick in the tournament. Honda, standing to Danish keeper Thomas Sørensen's left, kicked the ball with great force; Sørensen initially moved to his left, and as the ball sailed past the wall, he shifted direction, but could not recover in time to make the save. Japan's second goal came thirteen minutes later, also from a direct free kick, this time by Yasuhito Endō. Standing outside the penalty area directly in front of the Danish goal, he curled the ball around the wall. Sørensen had been standing on the right side of his goal and could not move to his left fast enough. Endō almost scored from yet another free kick early in the second half. This time, Sørensen appeared to have difficulty judging the path of the ball, and was only able to palm it away at the last second, where it caromed off the goalpost.\nDenmark needed to win this game in order to advance and increased their attacks accordingly. Late in the second half, Christian Eriksen put his shot over the goal and Søren Larsen hit the goalpost. They were finally able to score in the 82nd minute. When Makoto Hasebe was adjudged to have fouled Daniel Agger inside the penalty area, Denmark were awarded a penalty kick. Jon Dahl Tomasson took the shot, which was saved by Eiji Kawashima; the goalkeeper, however, was unable to control the rebound, which fell to Tomasson, and he was able to put it in the goal. Japan scored their final goal in the 87th minute. Honda dribbled into the penalty area, forcing Sørensen to attempt to block a potential shot, but Honda passed it to substitute Shinji Okazaki, who merely had to put the ball into an empty net.\nThe victory was Japan's second World Cup tournament victory on foreign soil, and only their second against a European team. Japan finished group play in second place with six points, and advanced to the knockout round for the second time in their history, and the first time on foreign soil. Denmark ended in third with three points. This was the first time Denmark failed to get past the group stage in the World Cup.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nCameroon vs Netherlands.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

Unusually, the points were scored by only one player from each team, with Andrew Mehrtens of New Zealand scoring all 12 of the All Blacks points, (three penalties and one drop goal) and Joel Stransky tallying all 15 points (three penalties and two drop goals) for the Springboks, including a drop goal in extra time, which sealed the victory and their first ever Rugby World Cup title.\nAt the end of the match, South African President Nelson Mandela, wearing a number 6 Springbok rugby shirt and cap, presented the Webb Ellis Cup to the South African captain François Pienaar.\nPath to the final.\nThe final was contested by the hosts, South Africa, and New Zealand. Both teams finished at the top of their pools, both undefeated in the pool stages. South Africa defeated Western Samoa in the quarter finals, and then France in the semi-finals to reach the final; the All Blacks defeated Scotland in the quarter-finals, and England in the semi-finals, a game in which Jonah Lomu famously scored four tries.\nGoing into the final, New Zealand had led the tournament in points scored, outscoring their opponents 315–104, while South Africa had outscored their opponents 129–55. The high scoring All Blacks had been led by Lomu, who had the record for most tries in a world cup match summary. Prior to the game, the national anthem of New Zealand, \"God Defend New Zealand\", and the then-dual national anthems of South Africa \"Die Stem van Suid-Afrika\" and \"Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika\" were sung by the Imilonji Kantu Choral Society.\nFirst half.\nNo tries were scored, but this did not diminish the tense atmosphere and climactic finish. The South Africans played a largely defensive game. Due to the strength of flanker Ruben Kruger and No. 8 Mark Andrews plus scrum-half Joost van der Westhuizen, the expansive attacks from New Zealand were repeatedly closed down. Andrew Mehrtens opened the scoring with a penalty after six minutes to give New Zealand a 3–0 lead. A Joel Stransky penalty put South Africa on the scoreboard after 11 minutes. Mehrtens and Stransky swapped successful penalty kicks. Following a period of pressure, Stransky landed a 32nd minute drop goal to give South Africa a 9–6 lead at half time.\nSecond half.\nThe All Blacks levelled the scores at 9–9 with a Mehrtens drop goal after 55 minutes. Though All Blacks fly-half Andrew Mehrtens almost kicked a late drop goal, the score remained unchanged at full time, forcing the game into extra time for the first time in a Rugby World Cup final.\nExtra time.\nExtra time began with South Africa needing to take the initiative, due to the ruling that if extra time finished with scores still level with no side having scored more tries than the other, then the team with the better overall disciplinary record during the tournament would win. But early in the first half, the Springboks were penalized for chasing a Stransky kick from an offside position. From just inside the half-way line, Mehrtens kicked truly to give New Zealand a 12–9 lead. As half-time approached, Stransky put a high kick for his teammates to chase, and from the resultant play referee Morrison penalized the All Blacks for diving to the ground near the tackle, and right on the stroke of half-time Stransky levelled the scores at 12–12. Seven minutes from time it was Stransky who scored the final point. From thirty metres out he struck the drop goal, securing South Africa's victory and the Rugby World Cup crown.\nAftermath.\nAfter the match Nelson Mandela, wearing a Springbok rugby shirt and cricket cap, presented the Webb Ellis Cup to South Africa captain François Pienaar. The moment is one of the most famous of any sporting final. In 2002, Mandela's presentation was listed at number 70 in a list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments on a British television programme.\nDuring the end of tournament banquet, South Africa's rugby president, Louis Luyt said in his speech that \"There were no true world champions in the 1987 and 1991 World Cups because South Africa were not there.\" This claim led the New Zealand team to walk out of the dinner.\nIn popular culture.\nMandela and Pienaar's involvement in the 1995 World Cup became the subject of Clint Eastwood's Oscar-nominated 2009 film \"Invictus\", featuring Morgan Freeman as Mandela and Matt Damon as Pienaar, with the final as the climactic scene and filmed on location at Ellis Park. Chester Williams, the only black player in the 1995 Springbok squad, was a technical consultant.\nPoisoning allegations.\nNew Zealand coach Laurie Mains and doctor Mike Bowen have claimed that the All Blacks were intentionally food poisoned while staying at a South African hotel. The South African side has rebuffed these claims and New Zealand manager Colin Meads has attributed the poisoning to \"dodgy milk\" rather than an intentional act."

        "title": "Rio de Janeiro bid for the 2007 Pan American Games",
        "text": "The Rio de Janeiro bid for the 2007 Pan American Games was a successful campaign, first recognised by the Pan American Sports Organization (PASO) in August 2001. Rio de Janeiro began working on the idea of staging the 2007 Pan American Games during the 1999 Pan American Games held in Winnipeg, Canada. There was a strong desire among sportspersons and officials at that time to work so that the best of national sport could be showcased at home, in a large event using state-of-the-art fields-of-play. Based on this strategic vision, the Brazilian Olympic Committee (BOC) General Assembly decided in December 1999 that Brazil would not bid to host the 2008 Summer Olympics and would instead focus its efforts on the bid for the 2007 Pan American Games. The important results obtained by the Brazilian delegation at the Winnipeg Games and the wide publicity for the event in Brazil encouraged sports authorities to definitely support the Rio de Janeiro bid to host the 2007 Pan American Games.\nDetails.\nThe official bid was submitted in August 2001 during the XXXIX Pan American Sports Organization (PASO) General Assembly held in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. In April 2002, following delivery of Federal, State and City Government and BOC letters confirming country, state, city and Brazilian sport compliance with the applicable Games regulations, PASO announced the approval of Rio de Janeiro's bid. The Bidding Committee then submitted a detailed bid file for the Games. The document was prepared and developed with the assistance of Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV), which had been commissioned by Rio de Janeiro's City Government. In the running to host the 2007 Pan American Games, Rio de Janeiro faced off with the city of San Antonio, United States; which previously beat Houston, Miami, and Raleigh to become the American candidate.\nRio de Janeiro had in favour a compact bid plan, able to stage all of the competitions within city limits by capitalizing on its outstanding natural characteristics, which were conducive to building competition venues that were located close to each other and welcoming athletes in one Pan American Village. Rio de Janeiro got another boost from succeeding in preparing to host the 2002 South American Games, with competitions held in four different capital cities—Curitiba, Belém, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo—in as little as three months in advance. The Games were originally scheduled to be held in Medellin, Colombia, but intervening problems affecting that country forced the South American Sports Organization (ODESUR), to choose between canceling Games or moving them to Brazil, which took up the challenge to host and organize the event in record time.\nAccording to PASO statute and regulations, the host city was selected by direct voting during the XL PASO General Assembly held in Mexico City, Mexico, on August 24, 2002. The candidate city that received the simple majority of votes from representatives of the 42 member National Olympic Committees (NOCs) would be awarded the right to host the competition. The announcement was made by PASO President Mario Vázquez Raña. Rio de Janeiro received 30 votes against 21 from San Antonio. Marked by a professional strategy that included the showing of city and project videos, Rio de Janeiro's campaign convinced the majority of voters, accounting for a total 51 votes. The 30-member Brazilian delegation erupted into boisterous celebration celebrating the country's highest achievement in terms of sporting event organization until then, before the winning bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics."

        "title": "Comparison of Canadian football and rugby league",
        "text": "A comparison of Canadian football and rugby league football can be made because of their shared origins, resulting in similarities and shared concepts in terms of scoring and advancing the ball. Aside from American football, rugby league is the sport most similar to Canadian football. Both sports involve the concept of a limited number of 'downs'/'tackles', and in both sports scoring 'touchdowns'/'tries' takes a clear precedence over goal-kicking.\nOrigins.\nBritish colonists and the British military in Canada brought rugby football to North America. It, along with association football, became popular in Canadian and American universities. At the time association football, or \"soccer\", and rugby were not as differentiated as they are now and teams would negotiate the rules before playing a game. The sports of Canadian football and American football evolved from these intercollegiate games.\nMeanwhile, in England a schism developed in rugby football between those who favoured strict amateurism and those who felt that players should be compensated for time taken off work to play rugby. In 1895 this resulted in the formation of a break-away sport, rugby league, the rules of the two codes of rugby (union and league) would themselves diverge.\nOverview.\nModern rugby league has been judged by William K. Frampton as having \"an amazing resemblance to the original Canadian game\". Frampton characterised rugby league as \"so similar to the game Neil Taylor played that is effectively an improved version of it\". However the games diverged subsequently resulting in major differences such as the forward pass, where the ball is thrown to a receiver located farther down field.\nThe field.\nThe Canadian football field is long and wide with end zones deep. At each goal line is a set of goalposts, which consist of two \"uprights\" joined by a crossbar which is above the goal line. The goalposts may be H-shaped (both posts fixed in the ground) although in the higher-calibre competitions the tuning-fork design (supported by a single curved post behind the goal line, so that each post starts above the ground) is preferred.\nA rugby league field is similar, it may be 112-122 by 68 metres (122.5-133.4 × 74.3 yards). The longer boundary lines are \"touch lines\", while the shorter boundary lines are \"dead ball lines\". The touch lines and dead ball lines are out of play. Near each end of the field is a \"goal line\", or try-line; they are 100 metres (109.4 yards) apart. A scoring area equivalent to an end-zone called the \"in-goal area\" extends 6–11 metres (6.6-12 yards) from each try-line to each dead ball line, the ball may be grounded to score a try here. On the goal line are a set of goal posts in the shape of the letter 'H', used for other forms of point scoring: drop goal, penalty goal and conversion.\nPlayers.\nCanadian teams have twelve players on the field per side. Different players may be interchanged at will for offence and defence as well as special teams for specific activities.\nIn rugby league the same players both defend and attack - a system known as the one-platoon system in Canadian football. There are thirteen players and four replacements in a rugby league team, with twelve interchanges of players allowed to be made throughout the game. If the interchanges are used up and a player becomes injured and cannot continue, the team simply has to play a man short."

        "text": "OCSC SAILING was an accredited US SAILING Certification facility in Berkeley, California, located on San Francisco Bay. The name is an abbreviation for Olympic Circle Sailing Club, the Olympic Circle being a two nautical mile in diameter ring of racing buoys located directly outside the Berkeley Marina. (Note: There are several Olympic Circles around the country. They are used to conduct races as there are buoys at every 45 degrees on the circle, with one buoy at the center.)\nHistory.\nSailor Anthony Sandberg founded the club in 1979 on the Alameda Estuary. In 1980, Richard Jepsen joined Anthony as a partner in the business and they moved OCSC SAILING to the Berkeley Marina to take advantage of sailing conditions where 25-30 knot winds are typical.\nSailing School.\nClass offerings ranged from beginning sailing to celestial navigation and ocean passage making. All instructors were US Coast Guard licensed and US Sailing certified, and time on the water was supplemented with classroom instruction. In addition to the sailing school there was a club membership program which offers special classes and discounts on charter boat rentals to more than 1,100 members. Club members also could choose from a variety of seminars, lectures, movies, social events and adventure travel vacations that focused on the communal nature of sailing.\nCampus.\nOCSC SAILING occupied a six-acre campus in the Berkeley Marina directly on San Francisco Bay. It comprised three docks with over 50 boats; a club room with views of the Golden Gate Bridge; classrooms; a pro shop; a gear rental service; and a professional service department. The company also offered team and consulting activities that use sailing to emphasize teamwork, communication, on-the-spot problem solving and leadership.\nYacht Management and Sales.\nOCSC SAILING maintains the largest fleet of charter yachts in a single location on the West Coast and runs its own fleet service department. Boat owners contracting with OCSC SAILING in the charter management program receive yacht care and services in addition to 50% of the charter fee when their boat is used.\nVacation Charters.\nOCSC SAILING also provides adventure travel programs to a variety of locations around the world. Many of the trips center on sailing and flotillas, while others are centered on land based activities such as trekking.\nGiving Back.\nOCSC SAILING was an ongoing sponsor of sailing programs for disadvantaged youth in San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley and the East Bay. In addition, a percentage of net annual sales was donated to social causes and groups that preserve and restore the natural environment.\nReferences.\nhttps://yachtrentalmiami.com "

In 2017, the tournament was moved from Bangor, Maine to Easley, South Carolina. (Easley was the site of the Big League World Series from 2001 to 2016. The Big League division was discontinued after the 2016 Big League World Series.) It is patterned after the Little League World Series, which was named for the World Series in Major League Baseball since 2002.\nThe Senior League World Series is one of seven tournaments sponsored by Little League International. Each of them brings baseball or softball teams from around the world together in one of four age divisions. The tournament structure for each division's World Series is similar to that used for the Little League Baseball World Series.\nTournament format.\nThe six United States regions are:\nThe six International regions are:\nThe teams are placed into two six-team modified-double-elimination brackets based on geography (US and International) The semi-final winners play for the championship, televised on a network of ESPN. All semi-final and championship matches are single-elimination games. \nFrom 2002 to 2014, a pool-play format was used. Beginning in 2015, each pool plays a modified double-elimination format until only 2 teams remain in each pool. The two remaining teams in their respective pools then play in a single-elimination, semi-final match, with the two winning teams playing in the championship. From 1967–2002 the tournament was straight double-elimination, from 1961–66 it was single–elimination. From 1990 to 2001, a placement bracket was used to determine third place.\nBefore 2017, the Senior League was the only division of Little League that did not sort teams based on geography.\nLocations.\nThe Senior League World Series has been held at eight different sites."

        "text": "In Major League Baseball history, 65 teams have become defunct. These teams played in five different Major Leagues–the extant National League and the now defunct American Association, Union Association, Players' League and Federal League. Thirteen men who managed now-defunct Major League Baseball teams have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame: Ned Hanlon, John McGraw, Jim O'Rourke, Pud Galvin, Fred Clarke, George Wright, John Montgomery Ward, Harry Wright, Charles Comiskey, Buck Ewing, Joe Tinker, Bill McKechnie and Mordecai Brown. Hanlon managed the National League Baltimore Orioles to three league championships. Eleven other managers managed now defunct teams to a single league championship: Bill Watkins, George Wright and Frank Bancroft in the National League, Arthur Irwin, Jack Chapman, Jim Mutrie and Lon Knight in the American Association, Fred Dunlap in the Union Association, King Kelly in the Players' League and Joe Tinker and Bill Phillips in the Federal League.\nPatsy Tebeau's 579 wins with the National League Cleveland Spiders is more than any other manager won with any single defunct Major League Baseball team. His 1040 games managed and 436 losses with the Spiders are the most of any manager of a single defunct National League team. Billy Barnie's 1050 games managed and 548 losses with the American Association Baltimore Orioles are the most of any manager with a single defunct Major League team, and his 470 wins are the most of any manager of a defunct American Association team. Dunlap has the most managerial wins for a Union Association team, and King Kelly has the most wins for a Players' League team. Tinker has the most wins for a Federal League manager, and Otto Knabe has the most losses.\nChapman and Bancroft each managed six different now defunct Major League Baseball teams. Chapman managed the National League Louisville Grays, Milwaukee Grays, Worcester Ruby Legs, Detroit Wolverines and Buffalo Bisons, and the Louisville Colonels in both the American Association and the National League. He managed the Colonels to the 1890 American Association championship, and to a tie with the National League champion Brooklyn Bridegrooms in the 1890 World Series. Bancroft managed the National League Worcester Ruby Legs, Detroit Wolverines, Cleveland Blues, Providence Grays and Indianapolis Hoosiers and the American Association Philadelphia Athletics. He managed the Providence Grays to the 1884 National League and World Series championships."

        "title": "The Masters Apprentices",
        "text": "The Masters Apprentices (or The Masters to fans) are an Australian rock band fronted by Jim Keays on lead vocals, which originally formed as The Mustangs in 1964 in Adelaide, South Australia, relocated to Melbourne, Victoria, in February 1967 and attempted to break into the United Kingdom market from 1970 before disbanding in 1972. Their popular Australian singles are \"Undecided\", \"Living in a Child's Dream\", \"5:10 Man\", \"Think About Tomorrow Today\", \"Turn Up Your Radio\" and \"Because I Love You\". The band launched the career of bass guitarist Glenn Wheatley, who later became a music industry entrepreneur and an artist talent manager for both Little River Band and John Farnham.\nThe band reformed periodically, including in 1987–1988 and again subsequently; they were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame at the ARIA Music Awards of 1998. Both Keays, with \"His Master's Voice\" and Wheatley, with \"Paper Paradise\", wrote memoirs in 1999 which included their experiences with the band. Onetime guitarist Peter Tilbrook also released the biography \"A Masters Apprentice, Living In The Sixties\" in 2015. Keays died from pneumonia related to his multiple myeloma on 13 June 2014. Wheatley died from complications of COVID-19 on 1 February 2022. As from 2020 original members Mick Bower, Brian Vaughton, Gavin Webb and Rick Harrison performed as the Masters Apprentics with Bill Harrod on bass guitar and Craig Holden on lead vocals. Bassist and founding member Gavin Webb died after a cancer battle on 16 April 2024, at the age of 77.\nHistory.\n1964–1965: Formation and the Mustangs.\nThe Mustangs were a surf music instrumental/dance band formed in Adelaide in 1964 with Mick Bower on rhythm guitar, Rick Morrison on lead guitar, Brian Vaughton on drums and Gavin Webb on bass guitar. Initially they played covers of the Shadows and the Ventures songs. The band's output was profoundly influenced by the Australian tour of the Beatles in June 1964, which had a particular impact in Adelaide due to recent migrants from the United Kingdom. When the Beatles arrived in Adelaide they were greeted by the largest crowd ever seen in their touring career—estimates as high as 300,000 while Adelaide's population being about 668,000 nearly half of the city had turned out to greet them (see The Beatles' influence on popular culture). Following the Beatles' chart breakthrough and tour, the Mustangs changed style and took on a lead singer, Scottish immigrant, Jim Keays. The Mustangs rehearsed regularly in a shed behind the King’s Head hotel owned by Vaughton's family. Their original manager, Graham Longley, made a tape recording of a rehearsal; it was rediscovered and released on CD in 2004 as \"Mustangs to Masters ... First Year Apprentices\". After Keays joined on lead vocals, the band produced more original songs in the beat style.\nThe Mustangs established themselves on the thriving Adelaide dance circuit by playing in suburban halls and migrant hostels. They built a following with local teenagers, including migrants from the UK, which were an early influence on the band as they were directly in touch with current mod fashions, not as widely known in Australia.\n1965–1967: Adelaide years.\nIn late 1965, the Mustangs renamed themselves as \"The Masters Apprentices\" (deliberately omitting the apostrophe). Bower supplied the name because \"we are apprentices to the masters of the blues—Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Jimmy Reed, Elmore James and Robert Johnson\". By early 1966 they were one of the most popular beat bands in Adelaide, regularly selling out concerts in the city, as well as making visits to outlying towns of Murray Bridge, Mount Gambier and Whyalla. Their first TV appearance, on Good Friday, was on a Channel 7 telethon hosted by Adelaide TV celebrity Ernie Sigley. They entered the South Australian heat of Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds and finished third behind the Twilights (eventual national winners).\nLater in 1966, the Masters Apprentices shared a gig with pop star Bobby Bright of Melbourne duo Bobby &amp; Laurie, who was impressed and recommended them to his label, Astor Records. A few weeks later, they were contacted by Astor, which requested a four-track demo. The band went to a local two-track studio to record it, but realised that they had only three suitable songs to record. Needing a fourth track, guitarists Bower and Morrison wrote a new song, \"Undecided\", in about 15 minutes; the backing track was cut in about the same time. The title came from the fact that they were undecided about a name for the song when quizzed by the studio owner, Max Pepper. The biting fuzz-tone of Bower's guitar on the track was a fortunate accident; it was caused by a malfunctioning valve in his amplifier, but the group liked the sound and kept the faulty valve in until after the session.\nIn August 1966, the band made their first visit to Melbourne. They made a strong impression with showcase performances at the city's leading discotheques. Their debut single, \"Undecided\" / \"Wars or Hands of Time\", was released in October and gradually climbed the Adelaide charts thanks to strong support from local DJs.\n\"Wars or Hands of Time\", written by Bower, is the first Australian pop song to directly address the issue of the Vietnam War, which was now affecting the lives of many young Australians because of the controversial introduction of conscription in 1965. 20-year-old Keays was one of hundreds of potential conscripts whose birthday (9 September) was picked in a 1966 ballot. He was able to legally avoid the draft by signing with the Citizens Military Force (CMF, later renamed the Army Reserve) and eluded a \"short back and sides\" haircut with the aid of his girlfriend, who pinned his long hair up under his slouch hat whenever he attended CMF sessions.\nDuring their second trip to Melbourne in late 1966, local radio DJ, Stan Rofe, had picked up \"Undecided\" and was playing it regularly, their raw sound and wild stage act led him to state:\nRofe, also a columnist with pop magazine, \"Go-Set\", championed many Australian acts during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. The band promoted \"Undecided\" on Melbourne TV series, \"Kommotion\", where members met Ian Meldrum who mimed to \"Winchester Cathedral\", Meldrum was also a staff writer for \"Go-Set\" and was later a record producer, host of the influential TV pop show \"Countdown\" and a music commentator.\nReturning to Adelaide, the band recorded more original songs, including Bower's \"Buried and Dead\", which became their second single, plus other tracks which were later on their debut LP album. The success of the second trip made it obvious that they should turn professional and relocate to Melbourne. This led to the departure of original manager Longley and drummer Vaughton, both deciding to remain in Adelaide.\n1967: Melbourne and debut album.\nThe Masters Apprentices relocated to Melbourne in February 1967. Vaughton, who remained in Adelaide, was replaced on drums by Steve Hopgood. \"Undecided\" raced up the Melbourne charts to peak at No. 9 locally. \"Go-Set\" had published national singles charts since October 1966 and \"Undecided\" peaked at No. 13 in April. The group became established as one of Melbourne's top attractions, performing regularly at discos like Catcher, Sebastians, the Thumpin' Tum and the Biting Eye and at a multitude of suburban dances. Despite such popularity, they led a hand-to-mouth existence for the first year or so in Melbourne, often relying on the hospitality of fans and friends. \nIn May 1967 \"Buried and Dead\" was released as their second single, and the band made a promotional film clip for TV (at their own expense), which is believed to be one of the first pop music videos made in Australia. They also undertook their first trip to Sydney, where they made a live appearance on the TCN-9 pop show \"Saturday Date\", where they were chased by fans on their way to the studio and had their clothes partly ripped before appearing.\nIn June 1967, Astor released the group's self-titled debut LP, \"The Masters Apprentices\" (also styled as \"The Master's Apprentices\"), featuring earlier singles, several originals written by Bower, a cover of Bo Diddley's \"Dancing Girl\" and the Beatles' \"I Feel Fine\". \nBy 1967 the group assimilated influences from the burgeoning psychedelic scene; Keays maintains that it wasn't until some time after that they began to experiment with the drug LSD. Nevertheless, their next single, Bower's \"Living in a Child's Dream\", is regarded as an early example of Australian psychedelic rock and one of their greatest pop songs. It was recorded at the newly opened Armstrong's Studios in South Melbourne and like all their Astor cuts it was nominally produced by staff producer Dick Heming. According to Keays, Heming's input was limited and most of the production was by engineer Roger Savage with considerable input from Ian Meldrum. Released in August 1967, at the peak of the Summer of Love, it reached Top Ten in most Australian capitals and peaked at No. 9 on \"Go-Set\"'s Top 40. Both \"Living in a Child's Dream\" and \"Undecided\" ranked in the Top 5 Australian singles of 1967, and \"Living in a Child's Dream\" was voted Australian Song of the Year by \"Go-Set\" readers.\nThe success of the new single elevated the band as teen idols, but as pressures mounted lead guitarist Rick Morrison was forced to quit after passing out on stage during a concert in June 1967, suffering a collapsed lung. He was ordered to give up performing and was replaced by Tony Summers (ex-Johnny Young's Kompany). Meanwhile concerts and tours continued, with the group playing up to fifteen shows per week. A tour of New South Wales in July included some of the last pop shows staged at the Sydney Stadium on 30 July, and at Sydney Trocadero ballroom (both later demolished). Also in July, they made it to the national finals of Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds, representing South Australia, finishing second to Melbourne's The Groop.\nIn September 1967, while touring Tasmania, the shy and sensitive Bower was found in his room in extreme distress, the promoter insisting they had to perform; faced with the prospect of going unpaid and being stranded in Hobart, they complied. Bower was dressed, taken to the concert and pushed on stage with his guitar around his neck; he stood motionless through the gig, arms hanging limp, and was hospitalised immediately after, suffering a severe nervous breakdown, and was ordered to give up performing. He was sent home to Adelaide to recuperate, and only returned to live performance in the late 1970s.\nThe loss of Bower was a blow for the band. Bower was central to their success, having written (or co-written) all their singles and all original tracks on their debut album. His forced departure left the group floundering, and they continued with \"de facto\" leadership passing to Keays. At the end of September, Keays and Webb chose Bower's replacement, guitarist Rick Harrison (ex-The Others) from Adelaide.\nOn 14 October 1967, the band played a free concert in Sydney's Hyde Park, as part of the Waratah Spring Festival. An estimated 50,000 fans packed into the park, but after only a few songs the concert degenerated into a riot. When the crowd surge threatened to crush audience members and topple the makeshift stage, police were forced to close the concert. Escaping band members were pursued by fans towards Kings Cross. That same evening, still dazed by the afternoon's events, they headlined the Living in a Child's Dream Ball, organised by University of NSW students. Keays later described the event:\nNewest member, Harrison quit immediately after these concerts and upon returning to Melbourne they recruited another lead guitarist, Peter Tilbrook from Adelaide band, The Bentbeaks. That band had released a single \"Caught Red Handed\", which had been banned by Melbourne radio in March for alleged obscenity. Not long after, Keays tried LSD for the first time. With Astor pressing for a new single, the band turned to their friend Brian Cadd of The Groop, who had already written a number of songs for his own band and for other artists, including Johnny Farnham. Cadd presented them with \"Silver People\", co-written with The Groop's Max Ross, which was re-titled as \"Elevator Driver\" and released in February 1968 as their fourth single.\nAs 1967 ended the band's career reached a critical juncture. They still had no songwriter, and both drummer Steve Hopgood and lead guitarist Tony Sommers were becoming disenchanted with the band's erratic fortunes. Keays decided to replace them and also their second manager, Tony Dickstein. In Sydney, Keays met two brothers, bass guitarist and singer Denny Burgess (ex-The Throb), and drummer Colin Burgess, both had played in a support band, The Haze, at a gig in suburban Ashfield. Keays was impressed and considered them for possible new members.\n1968: Classic line-up forms.\nIn January 1968, Keays reorganised the band with Summers and Hopgood departing, and Colin Burgess being flown to Melbourne as the new drummer. Keays then approached Doug Ford, an innovative electric guitarist from the second line-up of Sydney garage rock band The Missing Links and its offshoot Running Jumping Standing Still. The new recruits revitalised the band's career. Ford was a strong songwriter, a good singer and an accomplished electric guitarist who brought a new depth to the band's sound. He and Keays began working as a writing team. Ford's arrival filled the gap left by Bowers' departure and made possible their transition from pop band to rock group. \"Elevator Driver\"—written for them by Brian Cadd of The Groop—was released in February, accompanied by another film clip and a full-colour promotional poster. The band had to pay for these as Astor Records refused to pay for 'extravagant' promotional items. \"Elevator Driver\" provided them with a Top 30 hit, and kept the momentum going as they rebuilt the band. In March 1968, Webb married Suzette Belle, President of the Beatles Australian Fan Club.\nIn April 1968, bassist Gavin Webb—last of original line-up of The Mustangs—was forced to quit, suffering from stomach ulcers. Keays first choice for bass guitar was Beeb Birtles of Adelaide band Zoot and later of Little River Band but Birtles declined. On the flight home, Keays found himself seated next to artist manager Darryl Sambell, who was then enjoying the success of his protégé Johnny Farnham with his No. 1 hit single, \"Sadie (The Cleaning Lady)\". Keays and the flamboyant Sambell hit it off, and Sambell took over the band's management, which was a mixed blessing: he was a master networker and had a flair for getting publicity; he was also a partner in the newly formed AMBO booking agency, which proved helpful for concert bookings; but in the long run Sambell was more interested in Farnham's career and the day-to-day management duties gradually fell to band members. Sambell's pop tastes were also at odds with the developing progressive direction of the band's music.\nGlenn Wheatley (from Brisbane's blues group Bay City Union) joined on guitar just after Webb had left and Tilbrook switched to bass guitar. Upon Sambell's advice, they decided not to renew their contract with Astor and negotiated a new contract with EMI. Their next single, \"Brigette\"—released in June 1968 was their last recording for Astor—marked the debut of the Ford/Keays writing partnership. It was inspired by Donovan's \"Mellow Yellow\" and bears a resemblance to some of The Move's earlier singles. The quasi-baroque arrangement included a string section scored by The Strangers' John Farrar, and also took them into the Top 40. \nIn 1968, they topped the annual \"Go-Set\" Pop Poll as 'Most Original Group', and they came second to The Twilights as 'Most Popular Australian Group'. They entered the South Australian heats of the 1968 Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds, beating local rivals Zoot in a tense contest. They were runners-up in the national final, held in Melbourne in July, with The Groove winning and Doug Parkinson in Focus coming third. After the Hoadleys final, the manager of co-sponsor Sitmar cruise line, who had voted for them, offered the band a working trip to UK, with free passage in exchange for performances.\nKeays was interviewed by \"Go-Set\" staff reporter, Lily Brett and the 'expose' was printed on 17 July 1968, headlined \"Sex is thrust upon us\", the article and its follow-up, \"Whose breasts are best?\", revealed aspects of the bacchanalian groupie scene:\nThe 'bad-boy' publicity also frustrated Sambell's plans to market them as a wholesome teen combo. Keays stated that there was a backlash from the interview, the roadway outside Keays' flat in East St Kilda was daubed with the slogan \"Band Moll's Paradise\" in letters, threats of physical beatings from male audience members and the press claiming they were \"sex maniacs\".\nLive performances continued and in the second half of 1968 they went back into Armstrong's Studios to record their first single for EMI, although this was not released until early 1969. Meanwhile, Astor released \"But One Day\", an old track from their debut LP, as a single in August 1968, but the band urged fans not to buy it and it failed to chart. The band played hundreds of concerts during the year, touring around country Australia, visiting interstate capitals and dashing between dance venues around greater Melbourne. By this stage, Wheatley had taken on much of their day-to-day management. Their schedule was punishing—typically they would play three shows a night on Fridays and Saturdays at an average of about 45 minutes per gig, and often went to the Channel 0 TV studios on Saturday mornings for appearances on the leading pop show of the day, \"Uptight!\".\nIn December 1968, Tilbrook left the band, so Wheatley moved to bass guitar. Soon after, Wheatley found a message from the cruise line Sitmar and returned the call, only to be roundly abused by Sitmar's furious entertainment manager; he then discovered that Sitmar had offered the band work on a London-bound cruise liner, which had left the previous week, while the band had been in Brisbane. Unable to locate them, the liner had been delayed for an entire day while Sitmar found a group to replace them. The band confronted Sambell, who denied any knowledge, but a further check with Sitmar confirmed that the deal had been arranged, but that Sambell had been caught up with Farnham's affairs and had forgotten to tell them about it.\nBy the end of the year, finances and morale were low; despite constant performing, they were heavily in debt, and tensions within the group were nearing breaking point. By the end of the year, friction between the group and Sambell had become intolerable. Their final show of the year was on New Year's Eve, and between sets the band members talked through their problems, patched up their differences, and agreed that Sambell had to go. Wheatley offered to take on their day-to-day bookings and promotion work, leaving Ford and Keays free to concentrate on writing.\n1969: From pop to rock.\n1969 began with The Masters Apprentices settling their new line-up and the Ford/Keays writing team hitting its stride, the band now moved to its best-remembered and most successful phase. The long-awaited first EMI single was moderately successful, and even though it was something of a false start artistically, \"Linda Linda\" / \"Merry-Go-Round\", released in March 1969 marked the beginning of a short but successful collaboration with New Zealand-born producer Howard Gable. The bubblegum pop A-side, \"Linda Linda\" fell into the same faux-music hall category as UK songs like \"Winchester Cathedral\" but the rocky B-side showed hints of how the group was developing. The single gained radio airplay and helped to revive their waning popularity.\nThe band continued to tour across the country which helped weld them into a close-knit unit. Meanwhile articles, profiles, pinups and TV appearances proliferated; indeed they were overexposed, Keays claims, so they began to turn down TV appearances for fear of becoming too familiar. When they played at the annual Moomba concert in March at the Myer Music Bowl, they drew a crowd of just under 200,000 people, second only to The Seekers' record-breaking appearance there two years earlier. Their next single, the rocky \"5:10 Man\", released in July 1969, which peaked at No. 16 on the \"Go-Set\" Singles Chart and initiated a string of Top 20 hits. It was a deliberate move towards a heavier sound, as the band were keen to move away from the current bubblegum craze that their manager and producer wanted.\nAlso in July, with \"5:10 Man\" climbing the charts, they had their next attempt at the Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds, and once again they were runners-up—although this time they ran such a close second to Doug Parkinson in Focus that they were also offered the same prize, a trip to UK with the Sitmar line. According to Keays, his band won on points but the judges felt their 'bad boy' image did not make them suitable for first.\nIn August 1969, the band headed off on the Operation Starlift Tour, an all-Australian concert series, which featured: The Masters Apprentices, Johnny Farnham, Ronnie Burns, Russell Morris, Johnny Young, Zoot, and The Valentines. Although the tour was apparently a financial disaster, it was a promotional success for the band. The Brisbane Festival Hall concert was a highpoint of the tour and they drew a record crowd there, breaking The Beatles' 1964 attendance record. Wheatley was dragged offstage by the audience and had his pants and coat literally torn to shreds, with the result that one of the police on hand threatened to arrest him for indecent exposure if they did not finish playing immediately.\nAfter the Brisbane show, Wheatley calculated that the crowd had paid $5 per ticket—so box-office gross must have been at least $30,000–$35,000—yet his band, like all other acts, were on a fixed fee. They received $200 for the concert, and the top-billed act, Farnham, was paid about $1,000. Wheatley realised that the promoters had pocketed the lion's share of the takings. As a result, the group decided to manage and book themselves and over the closing months of 1969 Wheatley became more involved in choosing venues, booking shows and promoting the group with care to avoid over-exposure, cutting down on appearances and increasing their fee. They closed the year with the bluesy single \"Think About Tomorrow Today\", which provided another Top 20 hit nationally and went to No. 11 in Melbourne. It was later used by the Bank of New South Wales in its youth-oriented TV ads.\nAbout this time the band switched to wearing leather stage outfits. This fitted their 'bad-boy' image and had a more practical outcome—it was routine for the band to have their clothes and hair literally torn off by frantic fans, and the cost of buying expensive stage clothes which were being shredded nightly was sending them broke. But the leather gear—which resisted even the most ardent fans—provided them with their longest-wearing outfits in years, and Keays maintains it saved them thousands of dollars.\n1970: \"Masterpiece\" and United Kingdom first year.\nEarly in 1970, the band officially parted with Sambell and set up their own booking agency, Drum. Based in a terrace house office in Drummond St Carlton, Drum began by handling the band's own management but within a few months it was also booking and promoting gigs for The Sect, Ash, Lovers Dream, Big Daddies, Thursday's Children, Looking Glass, Daisy Clover, Nova Express, Company Caine, Plastic Tears, Little Stevie, Tamam Shud, Jeff St John, The Flying Circus and fourteen other acts, as well as promoting tours by overseas acts The Four Tops and Paul Jones (ex-Manfred Mann).\nThe Masters Apprentices had been stockpiling tracks since they signed with EMI, in February their long delayed second LP \"Masterpiece\" was released. Although something of a hodgepodge—as Keays freely admits—it showed the band developing a much broader range. It included the singles \"Linda Linda\" and \"5:10 Man\" and album tracks, \"A Dog, a Siren &amp; Memories\", and \"How I Love You\", although it omitted the song \"Merry-Go-Round\". By then they were coming to grips with the album format and emulated the current fad for concept albums by linking the songs with a short guitar-and-string arrangement, crossfaded between tracks. The title track, a live recording, provides a vivid aural snapshot of their live show during 1968, complete with the deafening screams of fans. The album also includes their own version of \"St John's Wood\", a track Ford and Keays wrote for Brisbane band The Sect, who had released it as a single on Columbia during the year.\nIn April 1970, EMI released, \"Turn Up Your Radio\", produced by Gable, and engineered by John Sayers. It was recorded at a late-night session and Keays later recounted that he was so drunk when he recorded his vocals that he had to be held up to the microphone. The song was deliberately designed to be loud and offensive, and was intended as the final nail in the coffin to their ill-conceived teenybopper image. It was released just before the start of the 1970 radio ban—a major dispute between commercial radio stations and record companies—which resulted in the banning of many major-label releases. Despite little commercial radio airplay, the song raced up the charts and peaked at No. 7 nationally.\nSince receiving their prize in the Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds in mid-1969, The Masters Apprentices were set on breaking into the UK market. They worked to save money for the effort with a national farewell tour in April–May. On 25 May 1970, they boarded the \"Fairsky\" for UK, their agency business was left in the hands of Adrian Barker. They were given a send-off by a crowd of fans and friends including Rofe, Sambell, Meldrum, Ross D. Wyllie, Johnny Young and Ronnie Burns. The six-week ocean voyage provided a break after years of constant gigging. Without the pressure and distraction of touring, they wrote and rehearsed new material. Arriving in English in July, the band entered a productive period, where they continued to write and rehearse, and made contact with other Aussie expatriates. Freed from constant performing, they immersed themselves in the cultural life of London, going on shopping sprees for clothes in Kings Road, Chelsea, ploughing through scores of new records and doing the rounds of clubs and concerts, seeing the best music on offer. Wheatley continued work on a manuscript he had begun on the ocean voyage, \"Who the Hell is Judy in Sydney?\", which recounted his experiences with the group. His memoirs were too hot for publishers at the time and were not printed until decades later when they became the basis for his autobiography \"Paper Paradise\".\nWheatley contacted EMI in London and met with Trudy Green, secretary to staff producer Jeff Jarratt. She liked the Australian band and got Jarratt interested, he agreed to produce them. EMI Australia agreed to pay for the album's recording, with EMI UK providing the artwork; the group were thrilled to record at the legendary Abbey Road Studios with Jarratt and engineer Peter Brown.\nJust before the start of recording, Keays made a trip to mainland Europe, and was in Copenhagen when he heard of the death of Jimi Hendrix, one of his idols. Back in London, Ford and Keays penned \"Song for a Lost Gypsy\", which they added to their songlist. The band entered the studio in September to record \"Choice Cuts\". The staff and facilities were superior to those in Australia, which allowed a greater range of expression. The songs they brought to the sessions—many written during the voyage—were original and distinctive, distilling their recent musical influences. This included the heavier sounds of Hendrix, King Crimson and Free, as well as the acoustic styles of Donovan, the Small Faces and Van Morrison. They brought in outside musicians to augment some tracks, and made use of Paul McCartney's white grand piano on a few cuts, including \"Because I Love You\". Towards the end of recording, they found themselves one song short of the optimum LP length, so at Jarratt's suggestion they wrote a new song, built up from a Latin-flavoured instrumental shuffle that Ford had been playing with. Keays wrote lyrics for the piece overnight, they cut it the next day and it became the album's opening track \"Rio de Camero\".\nThe entire LP was recorded, mixed and mastered within a month. The choice of the first single was, \"Because I Love You\", a song of love, separation and independence, and became a popular and enduring recording. To promote it, they used Australian film-maker Timothy Fisher to make a music video. The simple but effective clip was filmed on a chilly autumn morning on Hampstead Heath. Black-and-white prints were shown many times on Australian TV, where colour was not introduced until 1975, but it was shot in colour, as were several other clips for tracks from the LP.\nThe album's cover depicts an elegant, overstuffed chair in a panelled room, with a mysterious disembodied hand holding a cigarette floating above it. It was from the English design group Hipgnosis, who were responsible for covers by Pink Floyd, 10cc and Led Zeppelin. Despite the prospects for their new LP, the band were caught by surprise after its completion when Wheatley revealed they were almost broke. They were determined to stay in London but desperately needed funds. A phone call to EMI Australia for financial assistance proved futile, so they planned an Australian tour. Wheatley headed home to organise it and secured a local soft drink company as a sponsor. The band returned to Australia at the end of December, just as \"Because I Love You\" was released. It was their fourth consecutive Top 20 hit, reaching No. 12 nationally, and became one of the key songs of the new era of Australian rock.\n1971: \"Choice Cuts\", Australian tour and \"Nickelodeon\".\nThe Masters Apprentices began their national tour in Perth in January 1971. Howard Gable joined them with portable four-track equipment and recorded their first show at the Nickelodeon Theatre. The band was tired and under-rehearsed, and were not satisfied with the results, these recordings became the live LP \"Nickelodeon\", believed to be the second live rock album recorded in Australia. Two of its tracks were released as singles in June 1971.\nIn their absence the band had been voted top group in the 1970 \"Go-Set\" Pop Poll, and both their 1970 singles had been hits. Nevertheless, the band and the music scene had changed by 1971, at first they struggled to regain their previous popularity. A breakthrough gig at Chequers in Sydney allowed the tour to gain momentum, helped by a lengthy profile in the magazine \"POL\", written by freelance journalist Howard Lindley. Lindley became an ardent supporter and started work on a film about the band: he shot several performances in the weeks before they returned to UK, but the project foundered when Lindley committed suicide, only fragments of his material survived.\nWhile touring Australia in February 1971, the group released \"I'm Your Satisfier\". In April 1971, \"Choice Cuts\" was released in Australia to widespread acclaim, reaching #11 on the \"Go-Set\" Top 20 Album Charts. They made numerous TV appearances, including a three-song live set for the ABC's \"GTK\" which included a live-in-the-studio performance of \"Future of Our Nation\". In Melbourne they played a concert at the Town Hall, supported by Billy Thorpe &amp; The Aztecs. \"Choice Cuts\" was released in the UK it was well received by critics. In May 1971, John Halsall called from London to inform them that \"Choice Cuts\" was receiving glowing notices in the English music press, including a rave review in \"Melody Maker\". He told them it was selling well in UK and starting to make an impression in Europe—the track \"I'm Your Satisfier\" had been released in France and had gone into the Top 10 there. Halsall urged them to return to London as soon as possible and that they would be able to record a new album there, so they organised their return and EMI agreed to finance another LP when they got to London. \nBy the time they arrived in the UK, almost three months had passed since Halsall's phone call and interest was waning. At this point a new UK label Bronze—who had just signed Slade and Uriah Heep—made an approach to the band. Although the group was hesitant, being still signed to EMI, they decided to use the offer as leverage in hopes of getting a better deal out of EMI. Wheatley delivered an ultimatum to EMI Australia, demanding that they either release the band from their contract or match Bronze's offer of £90,000 (or $180,000 in Australia). EMI did neither, responding with an advance of $1,000. Fearing legal repercussions, the band declined Bronze's offer. Keays' later opined that the best course of action would have been to \"sign with Bronze and let the lawyers work it all out later.\"\n1971–1972: \"A Toast to Panama Red\".\nReturning to Abbey Road in September 1971, the band were reunited with Jarratt and Brown plus engineer (and Sgt Pepper's veteran) Richard Lush. Most of the new album was recorded in Studio Two at the same time that John Lennon was making his \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\" album in Studio One.\nAccording to Wheatley, one of the Masters Apprentices' tracks, \"Games We Play\", was recorded at George Martin's Air Studios, with Martin himself conducting the children's choir which features on the second part of the track. The album was titled \"A Toast to Panama Red\", in homage to the Central American variety of marijuana. The album was lauded as one of the best Australian progressive releases, but it was largely ignored at the time. Sales were hindered by the lurid cover, which even Keays later admitted was not an ideal choice, being as garish as \"Choice Cuts\" was tasteful. Designed and painted by Keays, it was evidently a dig at the UK and featured a grotesque psychedelic caricature of a bulldog's head wearing a Union Jack eye patch, its ears are skewered by an arrow from which dangles a tag emblazoned with the album's title.\nThe band played sporadic shows to support the album, which was well-reviewed in UK, but EMI Australia did little to promote them. Although Keays' recollections are more positive, Wheatley's own account of the album sessions is that they were an unhappy experience for him. He had a bad LSD trip the night before they went into the studio and began the recording in a negative frame of mind. Tensions mounted steadily during the recording and Wheatley did not play on some of the tracks, with his parts covered by Ford. According to Keays, Wheatley had been working part-time at a management agency over the previous few months and had insufficient time to rehearse because of his day job.\nIn January 1972, EMI released \"A Toast to Panama Red\" and in February they released the single \"Love Is\", which had been recorded using a twelve-string acoustic specially loaned to Ford for the occasion by one of his heroes, The Shadows' Hank B. Marvin. The classic line-up's last recording was the album's delicate and poignant closing track, \"Thyme To Rhyme\". According to Ian McFarlane in his \"Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop\" the album, \"A Toast to Panama Red\" is \"one of the great lost treasures of the Australian progressive rock era\".\nWheatley tried to convince the rest of the band that they should break up but they disagreed, so he announced he was leaving to work full-time for the management agency. Soon after, Keays announced his own departure and intention to return to Australia immediately. Ford and Burgess decided to keep going and they sent for Burgess' brother Denny, who took over on bass guitar. The final trio line-up soldiered on for a few months, and made one recording, \"Freedom Seekers\" before finally splitting in mid-1972.\nReturning to Australia, Keays undertook some final promotional duties for the \"Love Is\" single, including a TV appearance in which he performed alone, playing 12-string guitar. He then set about establishing himself as a solo artist, began composing songs, and also wrote for \"Go-Set\" magazine.\n1973–1986: Post-breakup.\nIn March 1973 Keays played the role of 'The Lover' in the Australian version of The Who's rock opera, \"Tommy\". In 1974 he compiled tracks from the band's latter career and designed the cover for the collection, entitled \"Now That's It's Over\", with liner notes written by Howard Lindley. EMI released \"Rio de Camero\" / \"Thyme to Rhyme\" as a single in August 1974, the A-side garnered reasonable airplay but did not chart. In late 1974 Keays embarked on his ambitious concept LP, \"Boy from the Stars\", which was premiered at the final Sunbury Pop Festival in January 1975, where his all-star backing group was joined by Wheatley, recently returned from the UK, in their last performance together for over ten years. Keays continued his solo musical career, fronting Southern Cross, and from 2000 he has toured as a member of Cotton Keays &amp; Morris with 1960s artists Darryl Cotton from Adelaide's Zoot and Russell Morris from Melbourne's Somebody's Image.\nWheatley moved into a career in management, applying lessons learned and contacts made with his band to managing other bands. He spent several years in UK and America, on the eve of his return to Australia at the end of 1974, he was invited to manage the reformed version of Australian harmony-rock band Mississippi, after a name change to Little River Band they set about cracking the American market and Wheatley was instrumental guiding them to their historic American commercial breakthrough in 1976–1977. From 1980 Wheatley also managed John Farnham and oversaw his career revival, initially as a solo artist and then as a member of Little River Band, eventually mortgaging his own house to finance Farnham's hugely successful solo album \"Whispering Jack\" in 1986. Under Wheatley's guidance, Farnham staged a spectacular comeback as an adult pop artist when \"Whispering Jack\" became the biggest-selling locally produced album in Australian recording history.\nIn the early 1980s there was a revival of interest in The Masters Apprentices due partly to rock historian Glenn A. Baker, who featured the band for his \"Rock &amp; Roll Trivia Show\" on Sydney radio's Triple J, which in turn led to the release of a definitive compilation LP, \"Hands of Time\" by Baker's Raven Records in 1981. \n1987–present: Reunions and halls of fame.\nThe classic Burgess, Ford, Keays and Wheatley line-up reunited in August 1987 for a \"Back to the 1960s\" special on the popular TV variety show \"Hey Hey It's Saturday\". It marked the first time all four had played together since Wheatley had left in late 1971. They undertook a reunion tour during 1988 and released an album, \"Do What You Wanna Do\", featuring new material and new versions of their earlier songs. \"Because I Love You\" also gained new prominence around that time via its use in a series of advertisements for a well-known brand of jeans; the revamped version of \"Because I Love You\" peaked at No. 30 on the ARIA Charts.\nThe group minus Wheatley (who only participated in the TV reunion and a few early gigs) undertook occasional reunion concerts and in September 1995 released a new version of \"Turn Up Your Radio\" recorded with Hoodoo Gurus. \nAt the ARIA Music Awards of 1998, the Masters Apprentices received formal recognition for their achievements when they were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. The same year they were also honoured in Australia Post's \"Rock &amp; Roll\" series with a stamp commemorating \"Turn Up Your Radio\".\nIn November 1998, Colin and Denny Burgess narrowly escaped death after the car in which they were travelling was struck by a semi-trailer. Both were severely injured—Colin suffered multiple fractures and internal injuries and as a result could not be moved from the wreck for some time. Denny also received serious injuries and had to undergo plastic surgery. Both made a recovery and were the subject of a critically acclaimed documentary.\nIn 1999, Ford, Keays and Wheatley reunited in Melbourne to perform 'unplugged' at the launch of Keays' memoirs, \"His Master's Voice: The Masters Apprentices: The bad boys of sixties rock 'n' roll\", in which he stated that he would not initiate any further reunions. Wheatley's own memoirs, \"Paper paradise: confessions of a rock 'n' roll survivor\", was released later in the year. At the same times, all of The Masters Apprentices' original albums were re-released and remastered on CD.\nIn June 2000, ABC-TV screened an edited version of the documentary \"Turn Up Your Video\", which was accompanied by the release of the full-length home video. \nDespite Keays' earlier announcement, the band reunited on subsequent occasions including the \"Gimme Ted\" benefit concert on 9 March 2001, and the Long Way to the Top national concert tour during August–September 2002, which featured a host of the best Australian acts of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. The tour was inspired by the ABC-TV series \"Long Way to the Top\" broadcast in August 2001. Keays featured on \"Episode 2: Ten Pound Rocker 1963–1968\" where he discussed the UK migrant influence on their early work and \"Undecided\"; and in \"Episode 3:Billy Killed the Fish 1968–1973\" where he described pioneering pub rock and the band's groupies. The classic line-up of Burgess, Ford, Keays and Wheatley reformed although Wheatley only performed for a couple of the concerts and was subbed by his son, Tim Wheatley. Performances of \"Because I Love You\" and \"Turn Up Your Radio\" at the final Sydney concert, as well as an interview with promoter Amanda Pelman, feature on the associated DVD, \"Long Way to the Top: Live in Concert\", released in 2002. They also appeared at the 9 October 2005 benefit concert in Melbourne for former Rose Tattoo guitarist Lobby Loyde. Another performance was at the 2005 clipsal 500, along with Hoodoo Gurus.\nIn October 2010, their 1967 debut album, \"Master's Apprentices\", was listed in the top 40 in the book, \"100 Best Australian Albums\".\nKeays died from pneumonia related to multiple myeloma on 13 June 2014.\nIn 2014, at the band's induction to the South Australian Music Hall of Fame, the original Mustangs members reformed as The 1965 Masters Apprentices. Mick Bower, Gavin Webb, Brian Vaughton and Rick Morrison joined with Rob Pippan, Ian Politis, Nannette Van Ruiten, Matt MacNamee and vocalist Craig Holden to perform songs from various eras of the band.\nAs of 2020, the band continues in their original five-piece format featuring original members Mick Bower, Brian Vaughton, Gavin Webb and Rick Harrison along with bassist Bill Harrod and lead singer Craig Holden.\nTheir bassist and founding member Gavin Webb, died on 16 April 2024 after a cancer battle.\nLegacy.\nThe Masters Apprentices had continued under various line-ups from 1965 until 1972, reforming briefly in 1987 and on several subsequent occasions. Like their contemporaries The Easybeats and The Twilights they tried to break into the UK music scene, and one of the later members of the band, Glenn Wheatley, learned valuable lessons from their travails. After moving into artist management in the 1970s he played a major role in the Australian music industry and the media, most notably through his management of Little River Band—who became the first Australian rock band to achieve major commercial success in the USA—and Australian vocalist John Farnham.\nThe Masters Apprentices were popular throughout Australia, scored a string of Top 20 chart hits and were consistently hailed as one of Australia's best live and recording acts. They started out as an instrumental band, rose to prominence during the mid-Sixties \"Beat Boom\", moved through psychedelia and bubblegum pop, finally becoming one of the first and best Australian progressive/hard rock groups of the early Seventies. They went through many line-up changes, with vocalist Jim Keays being the only constant, and their membership also illustrates the intricate interconnections between many Australian bands of that era.\nThe group was notable in the Australian context in that they played mainly originals. One of their hits, \"Undecided\" (1967), was revived by Silverchair in 1997, and their well known song \"Because I Love You\" has been revived many times, including its use in an Australian jeans commercial in the late 1980s. Swedish progressive metal band Opeth named the track \"Master's Apprentices\" from their 2002 album \"Deliverance\" in honour of the band; Opeth frontman Mikael Åkerfeldt is a fan.\nAwards and nominations.\nARIA Music Awards.\nThe ARIA Music Awards is an annual awards ceremony that recognises excellence, innovation, and achievement across all genres of Australian music. They commenced in 1987. The Masters Apprentices were inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1998.\nBattle of the Sounds.\nThe Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds was an annual national rock/pop band competition held in Australia from 1966 to 1972.\nGo-Set Pop Poll.\n was coordinated by teen-oriented pop music newspaper, \"Go-Set\" and was established in February 1966 and conducted an annual poll during 1966 to 1972 of its readers to determine the most popular personalities.\nSouth Australian Music Awards.\nThe South Australian Music Awards (also known as SA Music Awards, commonly SAM Awards) are annual awards that exist to recognise, promote and celebrate excellence in the South Australian contemporary music industry. They commenced in 2012. "

        "text": "William Thomas Charles Cave (24 November 1882 – 2 February 1970) was an English international rugby union forward who played club rugby for Cambridge and Blackheath. Cave played international rugby for both the British Isles and England, and was also selected for invitational team the Barbarians.\nPersonal history.\nCave was born in Croydon in 1882 and was educated at Tonbridge School and Caius College, Cambridge. He entered the legal profession, and was admitted to The Bar in 1907. He joined the business of E. F. Turner &amp; Sons, of 115 Leadenhall Street in London. With the outbreak of the First World War, Cave joined the British Army and reached the rank of Second Lieutenant in the Inns of the Court Officers Training Regiment. On 25 April 1916 he was given the temporary rank of captain. After the war he returned to E. F. Turner &amp; Sons, became a partner and continued with the firm until at least 1935.\nRugby career.\nCave first came to note as a rugby player when he was selected to play for Cambridge University. In 1902 he was selected for the Cambridge team to face Oxford University in the Varsity Match, winning the first of three sporting Blues. Cave was selected for the next two Varsity Match encounters, a loss in 1903, but a victory in the 1904 game. The 1904 match saw a far superior Cambridge pack, winning most of the scrummages and wheeling the Oxford forwards. Cave had an impressive game, and scored one of the Cambridge tries, when the pack pushed the ball over the line for Cave to dive on.\nIn 1903, while still a Cambridge player, Cave was approached to join the British Isles team on their tour of South Africa. Cave was one of four Cambridge players on the tour, being joined by David Bedell-Sivright, Thomas Gibson and Alfred Hind. The tour took in 22 matches, mostly against regional and invitational teams, but also included three Test games against the South Africa national rugby union team. Cave was a regular choice throughout the tour, missing just two games, and played in all three Tests. During the tour, Cave scored two tries; his first was in the win over a Grahamstown team, but more importantly he scored one of two British tries in the First Test with South Africa, played in Johannesburg. The game ended in a draw.\nOn returning to Britain, Cave continued his rugby career, leaving University and joining first-class English team Blackheath. In the 1903/04 season, whilst still a Blackheath player, Cave was approached to join invitational tourists, the Barbarians. The nest season, Cave won his one and only international cap for England, when he was selected to face Wales as part of the 1905 Home Nations Championship. The game was a sporting disaster for England, facing one of the most impressive Welsh teams in the nation's history. Wales scored seven tries without reply, winning 25–0, England's largest losing points margin in a Championship match until their 12–27 loss to France in 1972.\nInternational matches played.\nEngland\nBritish Isles"

They lost the first game against England 1 to 12, the game against Scotland was lost by 5 to 20 and the final game against Wales they lost 14 to 16. They finished last place in the tournament.\nEHF Challenge Trophy 2009.\nThe Irish Men's team finished in 3rd place of the group G2 in the EHF Challenge Cup trophy in Malta. The 3rd place finish is the best result an Irish team achieved in the 10 years of the competition.\nThe schedule for the tournament resulted in Ireland playing the hosts Malta in the first match at the University Sports Hall. In front of a home Maltese crowd, the Irish were down at half time by 20:7. Ireland in the second ended up being beaten by a 36 to 20 score line. The game was marred by a challenge on Sligo's Brian Campion following a foul by a Maltese player, with the Maltese player receiving a straight red card.\nThe second game of the tournament for the Irish saw them taking on the favorites and eventual winners Finland. The Finns won comfortably by 38 goals to 19. Brian Campion recovered from the previous day's incident to take his place in the team.\nIreland's third game was against Scotland. The Scottish team, which had 4 players from the Great Britain Olympic Program, led 15:14 at halftime. The Irish ultimately won by 35:29.\nThe Bronze medal was not the only award the Irish won at the Tournament. Middle Back player Oisin O' Brannagain was voted onto the tournament's all-star team.\nEHF Challenge Trophy 2011.\nThe most recent Irish international games took place at the University of Limerick for the 2011 edition of the EHF Challenge Trophy.\nThe first game with eventual champions, the Faroe Islands, ended in a 30–20 defeat with Kevin Murphy's 5 goals top scoring for the Irish and Alim Khaliq receiving man of the match in goal.\nThe second match with Georgia was a similar story, the Irish losing 37–21. Chris O'Reilly top scored with 6 and Steffan Meyer's 4 goals helping him claim the man of the match for the Ireland.\nThe final game was against England, and Ireland took a 15–11 lead in the first half. However, the game ended 29–24 to England. The scoring in this game came mainly from the back court, with O'Reilly once again top scoring with 11 goals and Meyer adding 5. Both players were named in the All-Star team for the tournament.\nThe team competed in the 2014 European qualifiers for the first time in June 2012. All three matches, however, resulted in huge losses."

        "text": "The men's rings competition was one of eight events for male competitors in artistic gymnastics at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. It was held from 3 to 7 December at the Melbourne Festival Hall. There were 63 competitors from 18 nations (down sharply from the 185 gymnasts in 1952), with nations in the team competition having up to 6 gymnasts and other nations entering up to 3 gymnasts. The event was won by Albert Azaryan of the Soviet Union, the nation's second consecutive victory in the rings. Another Soviet, Valentin Muratov, took silver (the second consecutive silver in the event for the Soviets, as well). Masumi Kubota and Masao Takemoto earned Japan's first medals in the event, tying for bronze. \nBackground.\nThis was the ninth appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Four of the top 10 gymnasts from 1952 returned: silver medalist Viktor Chukarin and fifth-place finisher Valentin Muratov of the Soviet Union, sixth-place finisher Masao Takemoto of Japan, and seventh-place finisher Berndt Lindfors of Finland. At the 1954 world championships, the Soviet Union had swept the top 6 places, with Albert Azaryan the victor.\nAustralia and Canada each made their debut in the men's rings; East and West Germany competed together as the United Team of Germany for the first time. The United States made its eighth appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics format continued to use the aggregation format, mostly following the scoring tweaks made in 1952. Each nation entered either a team of six gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The 2 exercise scores were summed to give an apparatus total. No separate finals were contested.\nExercise scores ranged from 0 to 10 and apparatus scores from 0 to 20."

        "title": "Survivor Series (2010)",
        "text": "The 2010 Survivor Series was the 24th annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on November 21, 2010, at the American Airlines Arena in Miami, Florida. It was the last Survivor Series held under the first brand split, which ended in August 2011, but was reinstated in July 2016.\nEight matches were contested at the event. In the main event, Randy Orton defeated Wade Barrett to retain the WWE Championship with John Cena as the special guest referee. As per the stipulation of the match, since Orton won, Cena was (kayfabe) fired from WWE.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every November by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1987. In what has become the second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, referred to as the \"Big Four\". The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. The 2010 event was the 24th event in the Survivor Series chronology and featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brands. It was scheduled to be held on November 21, 2010, at the American Airlines Arena in Miami, Florida.\nThe Survivor Series chronology was originally set to end with the 2009 event when during a press conference held on February 11, 2010, WWE Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Vince McMahon announced that WWE would drop the Survivor Series name and rebrand the event. However, following public outcry and several different fan petitions, the name was later reinstated, and in June 2010, WWE started to release tickets for the 2010 event.\nStorylines.\nSurvivor Series featured professional wrestling matches involving different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines that were played out on WWE's television programs, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\". Wrestlers portrayed heroes or villains as they followed a series of events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\nThe main rivalry from Raw involved The Nexus leader Wade Barrett against champion Randy Orton for his WWE Championship with Nexus member John Cena as the special guest referee. At Hell in a Cell, two months earlier, Cena lost a match against Barrett, forcing Cena to join Nexus. His main priority as a member of Nexus was to help Barrett secure the WWE Championship from Randy Orton, having Cena help Barrett during a Battle Royale to name a number one contender and forcing Cena to help him during his match against Orton at Bragging Rights. At that match, if Barrett did not win the match, he would have Cena fired for breaking their stipulation from their match at Hell in a Cell. However, Cena attacked Barrett during the match giving him the win via disqualification, though Orton still retained the title. The next day on \"Raw\", when Cena won a match against Orton via disqualification, Barrett named Cena the special guest referee for their match at Survivor Series. This time, if Barrett did not win the title, then he would have Cena fired, but as an incentive for Cena to perform his duty, if Barrett did win the title, Barrett would relieve Cena from his obligation to Nexus. On the November 8th episode of \"Raw\", the General Manager made the stipulation that the match can only be won via pinfall or submission; in addition, the other members of The Nexus will be banned from ringside.\nThe main rivalry from SmackDown involved the World Heavyweight Champion Kane against Edge for the World Heavyweight Championship. After defeating his half-brother The Undertaker last month at Bragging Rights after their three-month war, Alberto Del Rio, Rey Mysterio and Edge all interfered in Kane's \"funeral\" for the Undertaker. Afterwards, all three competed in a match against each other for a number one contender spot. At the end of the match, Edge came out victorious and thus became the number one contender against Kane at Survivor Series. Over the next weeks, Edge kidnapped and psychologically tormented Kane's storyline father Paul Bearer.\nEvent.\nPrior to Survivor Series coming on the air, R-Truth (with Eve Torres) defeated Zack Ryder in a dark match.\nPreliminary matches.\nIn the first match, Daniel Bryan faced Ted DiBiase (with Maryse) for the United States Championship. DiBiase dominated in the beginning utilizing various veteran moves. He then threw Bryan to the outside with a suplex off the apron. Back in the ring, DiBiase attempted Dream Street but Bryan countered and locked in the LeBell Lock, and made DiBiase submit.\nNext, John Morrison faced Sheamus. The two opponents exchanged punches and kicks, until Sheamus missed a Bicycle Kick, which landed his legs between the top rope. Morrison capitalized, delivering the Flying Chuck. With Sheamus in a seated position, Morrison delivered a running knee to Sheamus and pinned him for the win.\nAfter that, Dolph Ziggler (with Vickie Guerrero) defended the Intercontinental Championship against Kaval. Kaval dominated at first with a series of kicks and even almost put Ziggler away with a diving Moonsault. Ziggler came back after delivering a leg drop bulldog, yet only got a two count. Kaval then attempted an inverted roll-up pin, but Ziggler countered by rolling him up, grabbing his tights for leverage and retained the title.\nLater, Team Mysterio (Rey Mysterio, Kofi Kingston, Chris Masters, Big Show, and Montel Vontavious Porter) faced Team Del Rio (Alberto Del Rio, Tyler Reks, Drew McIntyre, Jack Swagger, and Cody Rhodes) in a 5-on-5 Traditional Survivor Series Elimination Match. McIntyre eliminated MVP after Del Rio held MVP's foot down. Del Rio eliminated Masters after Masters tapped out to the Cross Armbreaker. Del Rio was eliminated after Big Show hit him with a KO Punch, knocking out Del Rio and making him unable to continue the match, causing him carried to the back of the arena by WWE officials. Big Show pinned Rhodes after a KO Punch, eliminating Rhodes. Kingston eliminated Reks with a Schoolboy pin. Swagger eliminated Kingston after Kingston submitted to the Ankle Lock. Mysterio eliminated Swagger after a 619 and an aided Splash with Big Show. Big Show eliminated McIntyre after a 619 by Mysterio and a Chokeslam. As a result, Team Mysterio won the match.\nIn the fifth match, Natalya defeated Lay-Cool (Layla and Michelle McCool) in a two-on-one handicap match for the Divas Championship, winning the title for the first time. After the match, Beth Phoenix returned to WWE and rescued Natalya from Lay-Cool, who attacked Natalya.\nNext, Kane and Edge for the World Heavyweight Championship fought to a draw after both competitors had their shoulders pinned down on the canvas. As a result, Kane retained the title. After the match, Edge attacked Kane by putting him in a wheelchair and pushing him through the fan barrier.\nIn the seventh match, The Nexus (Justin Gabriel and Heath Slater) (with David Otunga, Michael McGillicutty, and Husky Harris) retained their Tag Team Championship defeating Santino Marella and Vladimir Kozlov, after The Nexus interfered in the match.\nMain event.\nThe main event was Randy Orton defending the WWE Championship against Wade Barrett with John Cena as the special guest referee in a free or fired match. The match can only be won by pinfall or submission, and The Nexus was banned from ringside. In the end, Cena pushed Barrett into a RKO, allowing Orton to retain the title, and because of the stipulations of the match, John Cena was fired. Cena thanked Michael Cole and the fans on his way to the back to close the show.\nReception.\nThe event was generally well received by critics. The pay-per-view drew 244,000 buys, up from the 235,000 that the previous year's event received.\nAftermath.\nThe following night on \"Raw\", Cena thanked the WWE Universe and was given an ovation by other wrestlers backstage as he exited the arena. Barrett taunted him on his way out. Also on that episode, Wade Barrett demanded a rematch against Randy Orton for the WWE Championship. During the match, John Cena (who had been fired the previous night) attacked Barrett, costing him the match. Immediately after this match, The Miz cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase and defeated Orton to become the new WWE Champion. At , The Miz successfully defended his title against Orton in a tables match.\nWith The Nexus having assaulted security, John Cena was free to enter the arena and attack any and all members of The Nexus. Eventually a mutiny formed within The Nexus, and they threatened to kick Wade Barrett out unless he rehired John Cena. Along with that, the rehiring of Cena was met under the condition that Barrett would face him in a Chairs match at TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs. Cena would go on to win the match at the pay-per-view.\nOn the following episode of \"SmackDown\", Kane granted Edge a rematch for the championship in return that his storyline father Paul Bearer would be released from being hostage by Edge. Edge took the opportunity; however, Bearer would still be held hostage. Before the pay-per-view, Kane pushed what he thought was another dummy off of a ladder, only to discover it was actually Paul Bearer himself. At TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs, Kane was scheduled to defend his title in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match against Edge; However, Rey Mysterio and Alberto Del Rio, who were in a feud of their own, were added to the match courtesy of SmackDown GM Theodore Long, thus making it a fatal four-way. At TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs, Edge would go on to win the World Heavyweight Championship.\nNatalya and Beth Phoenix's feud with LayCool led to a tag team tables match at TLC, which Natalya and Phoenix won.\nAfter Survivor Series, the 2010 King of the Ring tournament took place, with John Morrison and Sheamus making their way to the finals. Sheamus would win, becoming the 2010 King of the Ring; he and Morrison would wrestle at TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs in a ladder match to determine the #1 contender for the WWE Championship, which Morrison would win.\nJustin Gabriel and Heath Slater would lose the WWE Tag Team Championship to Santino Marella and Vladimir Kozlov. A rematch was granted at TLC: Tables, Ladders, &amp; Chairs, but Marella and Kozlov would retain the titles.\nThe 2010 event was the last Survivor Series held under the first brand split, which ended in August 2011. However, the brand split would be reintroduced in July 2016, and the theme of Survivor Series became brand supremacy, featuring the brands in direct competition with each other. Additionally, in April 2011, the promotion ceased using its full name with the \"WWE\" abbreviation becoming an orphaned initialism."

        "title": "Pittsburgh Lyceum (American football)",
        "text": "The Pittsburgh Lyceum was an American football team that was based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from about 1899 to 1910.\nHistory.\nThe Lyceum fielded its first football team no later than 1899. The team in subsequent years played against many of the top \"Ohio League\" teams, the most notable being the Canton Bulldogs and the Massillon Tigers. It was regarded as one of the top professional football teams in Pittsburgh from 1907 until 1909.\nOriginally comprising amateur players, the Lyceum attracted suspicion of professionalism over the years as it grew stronger. According to \"The Pittsburgh Post\" in 1906, the team was still \"purely an amateur organization\" albeit one that was \"in the class of the big professional teams\". When trying to arrange a game against the Western University of Pennsylvania that season, the Lyceum was turned down on the basis that they were a professional team, a charge that the Lyceum denied. Football historian Bob Carroll referred to the Lyceum, at least in the seasons of 1907 to 1909, as a pro team.\nThe Lyceum was the last pro football championship team that Pittsburgh would produce until the 1970s. Many of its victories came against the strongest teams in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio; hence, it was given the moniker, the \"Tri-State Champions,\" in 1909.\nThe team was finally defeated in 1909, an upset by the Dayton Oakwoods in its final game of 1909. The Lyceum then broke up after a disappointing 1910 season.\nThe multi-sport Lyceum organization that the football team represented continued to exist, however, and a new football team was organized in 1924. One of the players on this team was Art Rooney, who went on to establish the Pittsburgh Steelers and become enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nMain organization.\nThe main Pittsburgh Lyceum club, of which the football team was one branch, was founded in November 1897 as a means to provide activities for young men. Its original home was in downtown Pittsburgh in the basement of the old St. Paul Cathedral (at the later site of the Union Trust Building). When St. Paul's closed in 1903, the Lyceum moved into a new clubhouse near the Church of the Epiphany.\nThe Lyceum was active in football, basketball, baseball, hockey, handball, track and boxing. It was especially known for the champion boxers who trained there, including Harry Greb, Fritzie Zivic and Billy Conn. The club placed an ice hockey team in the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League, the first or one of the first professional hockey leagues. Apart from sports, the club supported a drama society and held lectures, night classes, and various social activities.\nThe Lyceum building was demolished in 1957 as part of the redevelopment of the Lower Hill District."

        "text": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1990 represents the cricket season when the English club Derbyshire won the Refuge Assurance League winning twelve of their sixteen matches. The club had been playing for one hundred and nineteen years. In the County Championship, they won six matches to finish twelfth in their eighty-sixth season in the Championship. They were eliminated in round 2 of the National Westminster Bank Trophy and at group level in the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup.\n1990 season.\nDerbyshire played 22 games in the County Championship, one match against Cambridge University and one match against the touring New Zealanders and won seven first class matches altogether. Kim Barnett was captain for his seventh season. With dry conditions, the reduced size of the seam on the cricket ball and the extension of four-day cricket, the 1990 English cricket season was batsmen-friendly allowing them to build huge scores. Kim Barnett scored five centuries in the first class game and two in one-day events to make him top scorer. John Morris scored six centuries in first class and one in the one day game, and in both matches against Yorkshire three Derbyshire players made centuries. Ian Bishop took most wickets in the first class game at 59. Derbyshire had six wins in the championship but ended twelfth as on several occasions Barnett chose to make a (losing) game of it rather than playing for a draw. He declared against New Zealand on 30 for no wicket, declared at 250 behind against Leicestershire and chose not to play a second innings against Warwickshire. This emphasis on a faster game paid dividends in the Refuge Assurance League when Derbyshire won twelve matches to win the league for the first time. However they left both the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup and the NWB Trophy in the early stages. Two Derbyshire records were set in the one day competitions. The opening partnership of Morris and Barnett against Somerset was a record 232 runs. Against Hampshire they made their lowest score of 61.\nDominic Cork made his debut for the club playing one match in what was to be the first of many seasons. Zahid Sadiq also made his debut.

Team USA's medal haul, which included nine gold, marked the first time since the 1932 Lake Placid Games that the U.S. earned more medals than any other participant.\nThe U.S. alpine ski team rebounded from a disappointing showing in 2006 by having its most successful Olympic performance ever, gathering a total of eight medals. Lindsey Vonn became the first American woman to win gold in the downhill event; while Bode Miller became the most successful U.S. alpine skier in history after winning gold in the super combined as well as two other medals. Medal winning performances by Julia Mancuso and Andrew Weibrecht contributed to the team's success.\nIn Nordic combined, the U.S. team ended an 86-year drought during which the United States had not earned a single medal in the sport. Bill Demong won gold in the individual large hill/10 km, and Johnny Spillane won silver in both the individual normal hill/10 km and the individual large hill/10 km. Demong, Spillane, Todd Lodwick and Brett Camerota also won silver in the team event.\nShort track speed skater Apolo Ohno surpassed Bonnie Blair as the most decorated American Winter Olympic athlete in history with a total of eight medals in his Olympic career. Ohno gave the US relay team the final push for the bronze in the 5000 meter relay, and earned silver and bronze medals in the 1500 and 1000 meter individual events respectively. Women's 1000 meter silver medalist Katherine Reutter broke a streak dating back to 1994 in which no American woman had medaled in an individual short track event.\nLong track speed skater Shani Davis became the first man to win back-to-back gold in the 1000 meter event. Davis also earned a silver medal at 1500 meters, duplicating his Olympic results from four years earlier.\nFigure skater Evan Lysacek became the first American man to win the Olympic men's figure skating title since Brian Boitano in 1988 at Calgary. Lysacek is also the first non-Russian or Unified Team skater to win the men's title since Boitano. Ice dancers Meryl Davis and Charlie White won only the second silver medal in that discipline for the United States.\nThe U.S. snowboard team also enjoyed success, garnering five medals overall. Shaun White defended his gold medal in men's halfpipe, as did Seth Wescott in men's snowboard cross. Hannah Teter and Kelly Clark won silver and bronze in women's halfpipe.\nThe USA-1 four-man bobsled team, nicknamed \"Night Train\" and led by pilot Steve Holcomb, delivered the United States' first gold medal in the event since the St. Moritz Games in 1948. Holcomb's driving was described as \"super-genius\" by Kevin Kuske of the silver medal winning German team. Brakeman Curtis Tomasevicz and pushers Steve Mesler and Justin Olsen rounded out the gold medal crew.\nThe United States finished the 2010 Olympic Games by setting a new record for the most medals won by a single country at a Winter Olympics. The previous record of 36 was set by Germany at the 2002 Winter Olympics; with the silver medal won by the men's hockey team in the final Olympic event of 2010, the U.S. earned their 37th medal of the Vancouver Games. In addition, the U.S. team set a Winter Games record for bronze medals with 13, and the 15 silver medals by the U.S. was second only to the record of 16 set by Germany in 2002.\nMedalists.\nThe following U.S. competitors won medals at the games.

All results are taken from the official Vancouver 2010 website.\nTargets.\nUK Sport, the organisation responsible for distributing National Lottery funding to elite sport, set Team GB a target of winning three medals, of any colour, at the Vancouver Games; two more than the single silver medal won in Turin by Shelley Rudman. If achieved this would have been the best performance by a British Winter Olympics team since 1936 when a gold, silver and bronze medal were won. The target was set following £6.5 million of funding in the four years leading up to the Games. Whilst no particular events were targeted as potential sources of medals, the success of British athletes in the previous four years was taken into account when setting the target; the men's curling team and the two-woman bobsleigh team, Nicola Minichiello and Gillian Cooke, won world championships, and in 2008 Kristan Bromley became the first man in the history of bob skeleton to win the World Championship, European Championship and World Cup in the same year.\nThe preparations of Britain's skiers and snowboarders for the Games were hampered by the financial problems of the British Ski and Snowboard Federation (BSSF), operating under the name Snowsport GB, which was responsible for administering the lottery funds received through UK Sport. In August 2009 the BSFF was £300,000 in debt and a number of British skiers, including medal hope Chemmy Alcott, were forced to fund their own summer training camps in New Zealand and Chile. On 5 February 2010, just a week before the opening ceremony of the Games, it was announced that BSSF had entered administration after the Royal Bank of Scotland withdrew the organisation's overdraft facility. This put the participation of British skiers in doubt, as a governing body is a necessity for Olympic competition, but the British Olympic Association (BOA) revived a subsidiary company to take over. The financial difficulties suffered by Alcott, partly as a result of the BSSF collapse, led her to consider her future in the sport at the end of the Games.\nOn 25 February, having finished 19th overall in the medal table, and 14th out of European countries, head of Team GB Andy Hunt said that despite not reaching UK Sport's target the team \"have achieved what we set out to do\" by bettering their performance in the 2006 Games. This was in reference to Amy Williams' gold in the women's skeleton, which was the sole medal won by the team.\nSteve Redgrave, vice-president of the BOA, added \"I don't think there is a sense of disappointmentI think there is a sense of celebration of winning that gold medal. I would take one gold medal over five bronze medals any day.\" Hunt also announced that the BOA would conduct a strategic review of funding and may support the channeling of more funds towards realistic medal hopes.\nAlpine skiing.\nFour British athletes competed in alpine skiing events at the Games. Andy Noble and David Ryding qualified for two events each whilst Ed Drake and Chemmy Alcott, taking part in her third Olympics, qualified for all five variants. The preparations of Britain's skiers were disrupted by the collapse of Snowsport GB, but all athletes were able to enter the games after the intervention of the British Olympic Association. Alcott, considered a realistic contender for a medal, achieved the squad's best finish coming eleventh in the women's combined.\nBiathlon.\nBritain sent a single biathlete to the Games; Lee-Steve Jackson was the first British competitor to qualify for the Olympic pursuit and finished in 56th position. He also took part in the individual and sprint events.\nBobsleigh.\nBritain sent eight athletes to compete in the bobsleigh events with entries in the two-man, four-man and two-woman competitions. Allyn Condon competed in the four-man event having previously taken part in the 4 x 100 m relay at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney; the first Briton to take part in both a Summer and Winter Games since Marcus Adam. In the two-man the British pairing of Dan Money and John Jackson suffered a crash on their first run; they escaped serious injury, but were disqualified for failing to complete the run.\nNicola Minichiello and Gillian Cooke went into the two-woman event as the reigning world champions and after two of four runs were placed tenth, one position ahead of Paula Walker and Kelly Thomas. On the third run Minichiello and Cooke lost control, resulting in them crossing the finishing line with their sled on its side, and the pair withdrew from the competition before the final run.\nCumulative time and standings given in brackets.\nCross-country skiing.\nThree British cross-country skiers went to the Games, all three were competing in their first Olympics. Andrew Young and Andrew Musgrave, aged seventeen and nineteen, entered the team sprint\nin addition to their individual events but were forced to withdraw as Young, suffering from a cold, was unable to complete his leg.\nCurling.\nCurling events at the 2010 Winter Olympics were in the form of a round-robin tournament; each nation played all others in a group stage with the top four qualifying for medal playoffs. The men's team, the reigning world champions, won group stage games against France, Denmark, China, United States and Germany. These five wins left them in a tie for the last semifinal place with Sweden, who beat them in their group game. A single tiebreaker match was played between the two sides which was won by the Swedes in the first extra end. The women's team, skippered by 19-year-old Eve Muirhead, entered the tournament ranked seventh in the world and beat world champions China in their opening match, but won just two of their remaining eight games to finish seventh in the group and miss out on the semifinals.\nMen's tournament.\n\"Lockerbie CC (curling club), Lockerbie\"\nDraw 1\nDraw 3\nDraw 4\nDraw 5\nDraw 7\nDraw 8\nDraw 9\nDraw 11\nDraw 12\nHaving finished level with Sweden with five wins Great Britain faced a single match tiebreaker to decide who advanced to the semifinals.\nWomen's tournament.\nDraw 2\nDraw 3\nDraw 4\nDraw 5\nDraw 6\nDraw 7\nDraw 8\nDraw 10\nDraw 11\nFigure skating.\nGreat Britain had qualified seven athletes; one in ladies singles, one pair in the pairs skating, and two pairs in ice dancing. The team was announced as Jenna McCorkell in the ladies singles, Stacey Kemp and David King in the pairs and in the ice dancing Sinead Kerr and John Kerr, and Penny Coomes and Nicholas Buckland. Brother and sister pairing Sinead and John Kerr were considered medal contenders before the Games as they entered the event ranked fifth in the world. The pair, who came third in the 2009 European Championships, went on to finish eighth.\nFreestyle skiing.\nThree British women competed in freestyle skiing events, one each in the aerials, moguls and ski cross. Sarah Sauvey became the first Briton to compete in Olympic ski cross, as the sport was making its debut in Vancouver. She finished 34th in the qualifying rounds missing out on the medal rounds by two places.\nLuge.\nBritain's sole competitor in luge was Adam Rosen, an American-born athlete who had previously competed at the 2006 Games. The 25-year-old's 16th-place finished equalled his performance in Turin and was just one place off of the highest Winter Olympic finish by any British luger.\nCumulative time and standings given in brackets.\nShort track speed skating.\nBritain qualified six athletes in individual short track speed skating events. In the men's events four skaters competed, with Anthony Douglas and Jon Eley each racing at two distances; a team also qualified for the relay event. Eley achieved the squad's best individual finish, coming sixth in 500 metres, a position matched by the relay team. In the women's events Elise Christie raced in the 500, 1000 and 1500 metres and Sarah Lindsay also took part in the 500 metres but was disqualified in her heat following a clash with Canada's Jessica Gregg.\nKey: Q=Qualified for next round, QB=Qualified for B final\nSkeleton.\nFour British athletes qualified for the skeleton events. Amy Williams won Britain's only medal of the Games, a gold in the women's skeleton. Williams became the first British gold medalist in an individual event at the Winter Olympics for thirty years, following Robin Cousins' victory in figure skating at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, and the first British female individual Winter Olympics gold medalist since Jeannette Altwegg in 1952. Shelley Rudman, Britain's only medalist at the 2006 Olympics, finished sixth in the women's event and her fiancé, Kristan Bromley, finished in the same position in the men's event.\nCumulative time and standings given in brackets.\nKey: * New track records\nSnowboarding.\nFour British snowboarders qualified for the Games. Ben Kilner qualified 7th and progressed through the semifinals, however finished 18th in the Final for the men's halfpipe. Reserve Marcijan Harasymiw crashed on his second run and did not advance due to injury. Zoe Gillings reached the semifinals of the women's snowboard cross and finished in eighth position overall. "

The gold-medal tally of three was the worst ever result for Russia since the breakup of the Soviet Union, whilst the total of 15 medals was the country's second lowest score since the 2002 Winter Games. This was seen as a national humiliation considering that Russia was to host the next Winter Games at Sochi.\nAccording to Dr Maxim Titorenko, a Russian psychoanalyst and anthropologist,\"the reasons for failures were to a large extent psychological. By receiving advance rewards [from the government] for something they were expected to do in future, the sportsmen lost all psychological incentive for further achievements.” The comparatively poor result generated a \"chorus of criticism\" in Russia, and President Dmitry Medvedev demanded the resignation of Russian Olympic officials and ordered an audit. Corruption, as well as cronyism and apathy of Russian sports managers, was criticized. It was later learned that Russia's performance at the Olympics followed widespread misspending by sports officials and a dysfunctional bureaucracy, according to government auditors. Russia spent $186 million for the games, including preparations. The audit cited dozens of examples of money being wasted, saying the figure ran into millions of dollars.\nBy contrast, Russia performed well at the Paralympics, also hosted in Vancouver, the following month. This led the media to highlight the contrast between the achievements of the country's Olympic and Paralympic delegations, despite the greater attention awarded to the Olympics.\nWith Sochi being the host city of the 2014 Winter Olympics, a Russian segment was performed at the closing ceremony.\nCurling.\nWomen's tournament.\nTeam: \nSkip: Ludmila Privivkova \nThird: Anna Sidorova \nSecond: Nkeiruka Ezekh \nLead: Ekaterina Galkina \nAlternate: \"Margarita Fomina\"\n\"Tuesday, 16 February, 2:00 PM\"\n\"Wednesday, 17 February, 7:00 PM\"\n\"Thursday, 18 February, 2:00 PM'\n\"Friday, 19 February, 9:00 AM\"\n\"Friday, 19 February, 7:00 PM\"\n\"Saturday, 20 February, 2:00 PM\"\n\"Sunday, 21 February, 9:00 AM\"\n\"Monday, 22 February, 2:00 PM\"\n\"Tuesday, 23 February, 7:00 PM\"\nFigure skating.\nRussia has qualified two entrants in men's singles, two in ladies singles, three in pair skating, and three in ice dancing, for a total of 16 athletes.\nKey: CD = Compulsory Dance, FD = Free Dance, FS = Free Skate, OD = Original Dance, SP = Short Program\nIce hockey.\nMen's tournament.\nGroup play.\nRussia played in Group B.\nWomen's tournament.\nGroup play.\nRussia played in Group B."

China had its best ever Winter Olympics medal finish, winning five gold medals and eleven in total, finishing seventh in the medal standings.\nChina won its first ever gold medal in figure skating when Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo set a new world record for the overall combined score in pair figure skating. It was the first time since 1960 that a Russian, Soviet, or Unified Team flagged team did not win the gold medal. China also won its first ever team Winter Olympic medal in the women's curling event with a bronze. The women's short track speed skating team swept the gold medals in all four events. China also won three medals in freestyle skiing aerials.\nWang Meng won three gold medals in short track speed skating and became the most decorated Chinese Winter Olympics athlete ever. Zhou Yang won two gold medals at these Games.\nXiao Tian, deputy chef de mission of the Chinese delegation, described the outcome as an \"important breakthrough\" for China in winter sports.\nTarget.\nAt the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, 76 athletes competed in 48 events within nine disciplines and won two gold, four silver and five bronze medals. In an attempt to surpass that achievement, China sent 94 athletes to Vancouver, its largest delegation ever (record broken by the Chinese delegation at their home olympics - Beijing 2022).\nAccording to He Zhenliang, China's senior International Olympic Committee member and the honorary president of the Chinese Olympic Committee, the insufficient participation in Winter Olympic sports by \"ordinary [Chinese] people\" is still limiting the country's success in the Winter Games and is also discouraging any attempt to bid to host a future Winter Olympics.\nThe Chinese Olympic Committee had high expectations in particular for the country's men's and women's aerials teams; in 2003 they hired two coaches, American Peter Judge and Canadian Dustin Wilson, to lead an effort to revamp China's aerial training program, and by January 2010, the top four women and five of the top seven men in the sport were Chinese. Only two teams—those from China and the United States—qualified four male and four female skiers in the event. Aerials skier Han Xiaopeng, winner of the gold medal in his sport at the 2006 Olympics in Turin, was chosen as China's national flag bearer for the 2010 opening ceremony.\nOne potential competitor, speed skater Wang Manli, the 2006 silver medal winner at 500 metres, vowed in January 2007 to win gold in 2010, however, a chronic knee injury forced her to announce retirement in early 2008.\nRecords.\nIn the sport of figure skating, Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo set a new world record for the overall combined score of 216.57 points in pair figure skating. It was the first time since 1960 that a Russian, Soviet, or Unified Team flagged team did not win the gold medal. Shen and Zhao set a new world record for the short program with 76.66 points. Meanwhile, in the same event, the pair skating team of Pang Qing and Tong Jian set a new world record for the free skate with a score of 141.81 points.\nWang Meng and Zhou Yang set Olympic records in the 500 m and 1,500 m short track speed skating events.

        "text": "The Continental Basketball League (CBL) was a men's basketball minor league in the United States that began play in April 2010. The league was headquartered in Florida.\nHistory.\nIn 2009, Dennis Truax, who was previously affiliated with the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), was named the first commissioner of the CBL. Gary Perry, an owner of the Augusta Groove when it was in the Premier Basketball League (PBL), was named the first director of basketball operations.\nOn November 2, 2009, the Wilmington Sea Dawgs were the first team to announce joining the league. On February 16, 2010, the Carolina Cougarz became the second team to join the CBL. On February 18, 2010, the Savannah Wildcats became the third team in the CBL. and the Georgia Gwizzlies left the ABA to become the fourth. On March 5, 2010, the Birmingham Steel joined the league.\nTwo weeks into the 2010 season, the Steel left the league for the World Basketball Association (WBA) and was replaced by the Birmingham Sabers On 1 June 2010, the Georgia Gwizzlies were removed from the league for failure to meet operating standards, after having missed games against Birmingham and Wilmington\nThe league championship in 2010 was to be decided by a single elimination tournament in June. However, after the removal of the Gwizzlies, the schedule and playoff structure were truncated and adjusted. The playoffs became a one game championship between the first and second place teams, the Sea Dawgs and Wildcats respectively, which was won by the Wildcats 96-86 in overtime.\nIn July 2010 the Florida Flight moved from the WBA to the CBL. In September 2010, the Miami Stars and Palm Beach Titans joined. On March 28, 2011, the Heartland Prowl announced they had left the ABA to join the CBL. In the announcement of the Prowl, the absence of the Carolina Cougarz as a listed team coupled with their removal from the CBL website indicated that they had folded.\nIn April 2011, the Gainesville Galaxy joined. On 13 April 2011, the Cary Invasion was added. Sometime between April and early May, the Fayetteville Crossover was added. Before the 2011 season was to start, the owners of the Savannah Wildcats announced the team would be sitting out the season due to a family matter affecting the owners' ability to lead the team. Shortly after this announcement, the CBL announced the addition of the Port City Sharks as a replacement for the Wildcats in Savannah, Georgia. The league also removed the Miami Stars and the Palm Beach Titans from the team list for the 2011 season. The Port City Sharks failed to play the complete schedule and were replaced in later games by travel teams.\nIn 2011, the league once again played just a championship game, this time between the winner of the North Division, the Cary Invasion and the South runner-up, the Florida Flight, which was won by the Invasion, 131-101. No official explanation was given why the winner of the South Division, the Heartland Prowl, did not play in the game. The Wilmington Sea Dawgs and the Cary Invasion announced the formation of the Tobacco Road Basketball League and their membership therein, thus leaving the CBL. The Fayetteville Crossover then announced their move to this league as well. The Florida Flight moved to the newly formed Florida Basketball Association, and the Miami Stars and Palm Beach Titans went with them.\nIn 2012, the Raleigh Rough Riders were added to the league. However, the 2012 season was never played. The league planned to return in the spring of 2013, but a lack of teams prevented that."

        "text": "Israel has participated at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, which occurred from February 12–28, 2010. This was the fifth time Israel took part in the Winter Olympics. The Israeli delegation consisted of alpine skier Mykhaylo Renzhyn and ice dancing duo Alexandra Zaretsky and Roman Zaretsky. Tamar Katz qualified, but the Israeli National Olympic Committee (NOC) did not permit her to compete. They did not bring home a medal during these Olympics.\nBackground.\nIsrael participated in every Winter Olympics since the 1994 Olympics in Norway. The country has never won a Winter Olympics medal.\nThree athletes represented Israel in the 2010 Olympics: two in figure skating and one in alpine skiing. Mykhaylo Renzhyn was Israel's first-ever Olympic alpine skiing competitor during the 2006 Winter Games. Brother and sister ice skating duo Alexandra Zaretsky and Roman Zaretsky also competed for Israel at the 2006 Winter Olympics. Alexandra Zaretsky was the flag bearer for the opening ceremonies and Mykhaylo Renzhyn had the honor for the closing ceremonies.\nAlpine skiing.\nMykhaylo Renzhyn was the lone Israeli alpiner skier. He competed in the men's giant slalom and men's slalom events. He trains in the United States. Renzhyn competed in the men's giant slalom event on February 23, originally scheduled for the 21st. He finished in 55th place, out of 81 competitors that posted a time. He finished the first run in 1:25.77 and the second in 1:28.04, for a total of 2:53.81. He was 15.98 seconds behind the leader. In the slalom event, Renzhyn finished 35th of 48 athletes that completed the event. He posted a time of 52.84 in his first run, and 56.07 in the second. He finished the event 9.59 seconds behind the leader.\nIce dancing.\nIsrael qualified one entrant in ladies singles and two in ice dancing, for a total of three athletes.\nHowever, the Olympic Committee of Israel decided on January 24, 2010, to send only Alexandra Zaretsky and Roman Zaretsky in the ice dancing event, and not send Tamar Katz for the ladies event, because she failed to reach the criteria set by Israel NOC. The Israeli NOC said during an interview that they set targets for their athletes ahead of time, and Katz was required to finish in the top 14 at the European Championships (she finished 21st). The Secretary General went on to say that while some countries' goal is to compete, Israel's goal is to win.\nThe Zaretsky duo was coached by their mother in Israel. They did not get much ice time, and the arena was bombed multiple times. They later moved to the United States and were coached by Galit Chait. They competed in the 2006 Winter Olympics, where they only had two weeks notice but finished 22nd. The competition started with the compulsory dance, and the pair danced to \"Tango Romantica\", as the rest of the competitors did. The romantic music can be awkward for sibling pairs, but the Zaretskys say they act to get through it. They performed to \"Hava Negillah\" for the original dance and \"Schindler’s List\" for the free dance. They performed music from \"Schindler's List\" for remembrance of the Holocaust, and to pay tribute to their family's history. \"Hava Negillah\" is more upbeat, and they hoped to have the audience clap along and get involved. They placed tenth in each dance category, and finished tenth overall."

        "text": "The men's horizontal bar competition was one of eight events for male competitors in artistic gymnastics at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. There were 63 competitors from 18 nations (down sharply from the 185 gymnasts in 1952), with nations in the team competition having up to 6 gymnasts and other nations entering up to 3 gymnasts. The event was won by Takashi Ono of Japan, with his countryman Masao Takemoto taking bronze. Silver went to Yuri Titov of the Soviet Union. Japan and the Soviet Union each earned their first horizontal bar medals.\nBackground.\nThis was the ninth appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Four of the top 10 gymnasts from 1952 returned: fifth-place finisher Viktor Chukarin of the Soviet Union, seventh-place finisher Helmut Bantz of Germany, and ninth-place finishers Berndt Lindfors of Finland and Valentin Muratov of the Soviet Union. Muratov had won the 1954 world championship, with Bantz and Boris Shakhlin of the Soviet Union tying for second.\nAustralia and Canada each made their debut in the men's horizontal bar; East and West Germany competed together as the United Team of Germany for the first time. The United States made its eighth appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics format continued to use the aggregation format, mostly following the scoring tweaks made in 1952. Each nation entered either a team of six gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The 2 exercise scores were summed to give an apparatus total. No separate finals were contested.\nExercise scores ranged from 0 to 10 and apparatus scores from 0 to 20."

        "text": "Belgium sent a delegation to compete at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada from 12–28 February 2010. The nation has been to every Winter Olympics except two, both in the 1960s. The Belgian delegation to Vancouver consisted of eight athletes, competing in four different sports. The delegation did not win any medals, and their best performance in any event was ninth by Pieter Gysel in the short track speed skating 1,500 meters event.\nBackground.\nBelgium has been participating in the Olympic movement almost since the beginning, with their first appearance coming at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris. They have competed in every Winter Olympic Games except for the 1960 and 1968 editions. Coming into Vancouver they had won five medals in Winter Olympic competition, but none since the 1998 Winter Olympics. Belgium qualified eight athletes into the Vancouver Olympics: three in alpine skiing, two in bobsleigh, two in figure skating, and one in short track speed skating. This was Belgium's first time fielding women in bobsleigh competition, Eva Willemarck and Elfje Willemsen were entered in the two-woman race. Figure skater Kevin van der Perren was chosen as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony, his second time doing so. Short-track racer Pieter Gysel was selected as the flag bearer for the closing ceremony.\nAlpine skiing.\nBelgium qualified three athletes in alpine skiing. Karen Persyn was 26 years old at the time of her race in Vancouver, the women's slalom, which was held on 26 February. She was making her first Olympic appearance. She posted run times of 54.09 seconds and 53.87 seconds. Her combined time of 1 minute and 47.96 seconds was good enough to put her in 27th place, out of 55 women who finished both runs of the race. Bart Mollin and Jeroen Van den Bogaert each contested only one event, the men's slalom on 27 February. Mollin was 28 years old at the time, while Van den Bogaert was 30 years old. Both men were making their debut Olympic appearance. Mollin failed to finish the first run of the race, while Van den Bogaert posted a time of 53.99 seconds. In the second run, Van den Bogaert posted a time of 54.57 seconds, making his combined time for the race 1 minute and 48.56 seconds, which put him in 34th place out of 48 competitors who finished the race.\nBobsleigh.\nBelgium qualified one women's bobsleigh team. The two competitors, Eva Willemarck and Elfje Willemsen, were each 25 years old at the time of the Vancouver Olympics. Both were making their Olympic debuts, and Willemsen would again compete for Belgium at the 2014 Winter Olympics. The two-woman competition was held on 23–24 February, with two runs being contested each day. Belgium's sleigh posted times of 54.27 seconds, and 54.40 seconds on the first day. Of the 21 teams competing, Belgium finished the first day in 15th place. On the second day, Willemarck and Willemsen posted times of 54.64 seconds, and 54.17 seconds. Their final time was 3 minutes, 37.48 seconds, which placed the Belgians in 14th position for the overall competition.\nFigure skating.\nThese Olympics were Kevin van der Perren's third Olympic Games. His best finish was ninth at the 2006 Winter Games. He entered these Olympics with the goal of a top five finish. Van der Perren performed the short program in a skeleton costume. He thought it was his best short program he had ever performed, and expected to score higher than his personal best of 75.80 points. He scored 72.90 points, which put him in 12th place.\nTwice during the free skate, he had to balance himself with a hand on the ice after his jump. Since he was nervous, he simplified his jumps for the middle of the program. During the free skate he placed 18th with 116.94 points. He finished with 189.84 total points, finishing in 17th place overall.\nIsabelle Pieman met the criteria for the Olympics in 2009, but the Belgian Olympic and Interfederal Committee delayed in selecting her for her first Olympic Games. She needed to finish in the top 24 to advance to the free skate. She set a new personal record during the short program, scoring 46.30 points. Pieman placed 25th, and did not advance to the free skating segment. She was happy with her finish, saying, \"This was the best short freestyle in my career and I am very happy to have just been able to show that in Vancouver.\"\nShort track speed skating.\nPieter Gysel competed in three short track speed skating events: the 500 meter, the 1,000 meter, and the 1,500 meter. This was his third Winter Olympics; he raced in the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City and the 2006 Olympics in Turin.\nGysel hoped to finish in the top six of the 1,500 meter race, and thought he might medal. There are six athletes per heat in the 1,500 meter, with the top three in each heat advancing to the next round. He finished with the 21st best time in the first round, finishing in 2:18.560. Gysel was second in his heat, behind Apolo Ohno, and advanced to the semifinals. In the semifinals, there were seven athletes per heat, with the top two advancing to the A Final and the next two advancing to the B Final. Gysel was passed near the end of the race and finished fourth in his heat with a time of 2:16.249. This placed him in the B finals, and the best he could finish was seventh place. He finished third in his finals heat with a time of 2:18.773, which placed him ninth overall in the 1500 meter race.\nHe drew a tough matchup in the 1,000 meter race: Sochi 1,500 meter gold medalist Lee Jung-Su and bronze medalist J.R. Celski. He was in second place for most of the race, which would have advanced him to the quarterfinals. Towards the end of the race, he lost some speed coming out of a turn and was passed by Celski. Gysel was eliminated in the first round after finishing in 19th place, with a time of 1:25.113. Even though he had the seventh best time, he placed third in his heat and was eliminated from competition.\nGysel came to the Olympics with the ambition to finish in the top eight in the 500 meter race. He finished second in his heat that featured two strong competitors: vice world champion Kwak Yoon-gy and Jordan Malone. Malone was considered one of the best in the world for this event. Gysel was in third place during the final lap when Malone crashed. Gysel overtook him and finished second in the heat, with a time of 42.443 seconds. He advanced to the quarterfinals with the slowest time of those that advanced. Gysel drew a difficult quarterfinal matchup, which featured the 2006 silver medalist, Canadian François-Louis Tremblay, and another round against Kwak. He was eliminated from the event in the quarterfinals. He placed last out of the four competitors; he needed to finish in the top two in order to advance to the semifinals."

The Brazilian team consisted of five athletes competing in three sports.\nBackground.\nBrazil's first Olympic Games were the 1900 Summer Olympics. Their first Winter Olympics came much later, in 1992, and they have competed in every Winter Games since their debut. As of these Games, they have not won a Winter Olympics medal. Snowboarder Isabel Clark Ribeiro was chosen as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony and cross-country skier Jaqueline Mourão was selected for the closing ceremony. Clark had previously been the flag bearer at the 2006 Winter Olympics opening ceremony. Mourão would go on to be the flag bearer at the 2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony.\nAlpine skiing.\nMaya Harrisson was born in Brazil but was adopted by a Swiss family and grew up in Europe. She competed at these Olympics at the age of 17.\nCross-country skiing.\nLeandro Ribela was 29 years old at the time of these Olympics, and he was making his Olympic debut. He had taken up skiing at the age of 12 following a trip to Argentina. In the 15 kilometre freestyle race, held on 15 February, he finished with a time of 43 minutes and 36.2 seconds. This put him in 90th place, out of 95 competitors who finished the race. He would later represent Brazil again at the 2014 Winter Olympics.\nJaqueline Mourão was 34 years old at the time of these Games, and was making her fourth Olympic appearance. She had previously participated in the 2004 and 2008 Summer Olympics in the sport of cycling, and the 2006 Winter Olympics as a cross-country skier. In Vancouver, she took part in the 10 kilometre freestyle on 15 February. She finished the race in a time of 30 minutes and 22.2 seconds. This put her in 66th place out of 77 athletes who finished the race. Like her teammate Ribela, she would also go on to represent Brazil four years later, this time expanding her efforts to both biathlon and cross-country skiing.\nSnowboarding.\nIsabel Clark Ribeiro started snowboarding at the age of 18, after trying it out in California. She was 33 years old at the time of the Vancouver Olympics, and had previously represented Brazil at the 2006 Turin Olympics. She came in ninth place in the snowboard cross in Turin. In Vancouver, the women's snowboard cross held its qualification round on 16 February. Each competitor raced twice in the qualification round, with only the better of the times counting. The top 16 were able to progress to the next round of the competition. In her first run, she posted a time of 1 minute and 41.10 seconds, followed by a slower time of 1 minute and 51.65 seconds. Her better time still saw her in 19th place, and she was eliminated from the competition. In the run up to her participation at the 2014 Winter Olympics Ribeiro said she had landed flat after a jump and injured her knee in Vancouver."

He won eleven caps for Wales and was part of the first Grand Slam winning side in 1908.\nRugby career.\nAt school and after leaving school, Watts first gained prominence playing for Moonlights, a successful Llanelli junior team, which won the South Wales cup four times in succession. He them became a steelworker and moved to the first-class Welsh team Llanelli team circa 1897 where he played the majority of his rugby career. In the 1903–04 season was given the captaincy of the first team. Despite this accolade, Watts was not selected for the Wales national team until the 1907 Home Nations Championship. However, as part of the Llanelli team, he played against the South African team at Stradey Park in December 1906. His first international was against England, played at home at St. Helen's, and the match ended in a Welsh win. Watts was reselected for the remaining two games of the Championship, an away loss to Scotland, and a crushing home win over Ireland. Watts had joined the Wales team during their first 'Golden Age', and the loss to Scotland would be the only international defeat of his 11-match career.\nWatts was back in the Wales team for the 1908 Home Nations Championship, and played in all three matches of the series and the very first international encounter between Wales and France played in preparation for France joining the competition in 1910. Wales won all three Championship games, winning the tournament and taking the Triple Crown; and in beating France at the Cardiff Arms Park the team also took the first Grand Slam title.\nAt the start of the 1908/09 season, the very first touring Australian team arrived in Britain. Llanelli were the seventh British team to face the tourist, who to that point were unbeaten. Under the captaincy of Tom Evans, Watts was part of the Llanelli team that faced the Australians at Stradey Park; Llanelli winning a memorable match 8–3. Two months later Watts was part of the Wales team to face the same touring Australians, Wales winning thanks to a second-half penalty kick from Bert Winfield.\nWatts' final international campaign was the 1909 Home Nations Championship, which began with narrow wins over England and Scotland. The third game was the last 'unofficial' encounter with the French team, which saw Wales score eleven tries. Ten of the tries came from the three-quarters positions, with Watts scoring the other try, his first international points. Watts final match for his country was the Championship decider against Ireland. An 18–5 win, and his second international try, gave Wales a second Grand Slam win and made Watts a double Triple Crown winner.\nFor the 1910–11 season, Watts was the captain of his home team, Llanelli.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

Up to 4 four players could play a single game playing alternately. The controls feature a trackball which is used to control both direction and power, and two buttons which control left and right spin or hook. Comedic animations play for making certain shots.\nThe game was released in both an upright cabinet and a cocktail version. Most of the upright cabinets are conversion kits for existing cabinets although a limited number of dedicated cabinets were produced. These cabinets featured a birch plywood finish to mimic a bowling lane, a larger marbled trackball and painted side art. The Japanese version featured a different cabinet.\nAn alternate version, \"Coors Light Bowling\", was released the following year. This version features endorsement from the beer Coors Light. The title screen is completely different on this version and some of the animations were changed to add Coors Light references.\nReception.\nIn Japan, \"Game Machine\" listed \"Capcom Bowling\" on their October 1, 1988 issue as being the most-successful upright/cockpit arcade unit of the month. In North America, it was a commercial success, selling about 12,000 arcade units by early 1991.\n\"Your Sinclair\" called the game \"quite fun\" but \"a little quick and easy\".\n\"Bowlingo\".\nIn 1990, Capcom entered the bowling industry with \"Bowlingo\". It was a coin-operated, electro-mechanical, fully automated mini ten-pin bowling installation. It was smaller than a standard bowling alley, designed to be smaller and cheaper for amusement arcades. \"Bowlingo\" drew significant earnings in North America upon release in 1990."

She was ranked first among league rookies in scoring with 34 points and also led the freshman class with 17 goals. She was the fourth leading scorer in the WCHA overall. Duggan tallied five WCHA weekly honors overall, the most ever by a UW player in a single season.\nMark Johnson was awarded WCHA Coach of the Year for the second straight year. Johnson is the son of the late Badgers' men's coach (and Stanley Cup champion) Bob Johnson, and has a career record of 142–28–14.\nPostseason.\nThe game-winning goal was scored by Junior Jinelle Zaugg. She received a pass from Sara Bauer that went over Harvard goalie Brittany Martin's shoulder to end the game after 127 minutes and :09 seconds of play. The Badgers' seven-period game ranks as the second longest game in NCAA history, the longest played in 1996 when New Hampshire defeated Providence 3–2 in five overtimes."

        "text": "Bruce Edward Carter (born February 19, 1988) is a former American football linebacker. He was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the second round of the 2011 NFL Draft. He played college football at the University of North Carolina.\nEarly years.\nCarter attended Havelock High School in Havelock, North Carolina. He played quarterback, safety and running back for the football team. As a senior, he rushed for 1,063 yards with 15 touchdowns as a running back and threw for 585 yards and five touchdowns as a quarterback.\nConsidered a three-star recruit by \"Rivals.com\", Carter was listed as the No. 33 safety prospect in the nation.\nCollege career.\nFreshman year.\nCarter was converted to linebacker in college. In the Tar Heels' season opener, against James Madison, Carter got his first blocked punt. The football was recovered in the end zone by a fellow Tar Heel for a touchdown. Carter started his first game as a Tar Heel in the game against East Carolina, he garnered four tackles during the game. As a freshman in 2007 Carter started seven of 12 games, recording 25 tackles.\nSophomore year.\nAs a sophomore in 2008 Carter started all 13 games at outside linebacker. In the game against Rutgers, Carter intercepted a pass and returned it 66 yards for a touchdown, this was the first touchdown of his career. In the Tar Heels' game against Miami, Carter blocked one punt. The blocked punt proved to be crucial, as the Tar Heels drove 56 yards down the field and scored after the punt was blocked. One of Bruce Carter's best games of his sophomore season was the game against Connecticut. The blocking of three punts in one game earned Carter the ACC record for most punts blocked in a single game. In that game he recorded three blocked punts, all of which occurred during the second quarter of the game. In the Tar Heels' loss to the Virginia Cavaliers, Carter blocked a Cavalier field goal attempt. He finished the season with 68 tackles, five sacks, an interception, which was returned for a touchdown, and a nation leading five blocked kicks.\nJunior year.\nCarter started all 13 games as an outside linebacker. Carter tipped a punt in the Tar Heel's game against the Citadel. In the Tar Heels' game against Georgia Southern, Carter intercepted a pass and returned it 48 yards for a touchdown, this was Carter's second career touchdown. As a junior in 2009, Carter has 48 tackles, a sack, and an interception. Carter earned a career-high 13 tackles in the game against NC State. Carter was voted to Second-team All-ACC. This was Carter's only season where he did not record a blocked punt.\nSenior year.\nCarter returned an interception 55 yards for a touchdown in the third game of the season against Rutgers. In that game Carter also recorded a blocked punt and seven tackles. Carter's senior season was cut short due to a knee injury, which dropped his draft stock. He sustained the injury during the game against NC State. He would miss the last two games of the season against Duke and the 2010 Music City Bowl, which was played against Tennessee Volunteers. \nHe was a finalist for the 2010 Butkus Award, but lost to Von Miller of Texas A&amp;M. He finished his final season as a Tar Heel with 57 tackles, 3.5 tackles for loss, 2.5 sacks, and one forced fumble. Carter was again voted to Second-team All-ACC.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\n2011 season.\nCarter was considered one of the top linebacker prospects for the 2011 NFL Draft. Carter was projected as a first-round draft pick before sustaining an ACL injury in his left knee during his senior season. The Dallas Cowboys selected him in the second round (40th overall) of the 2011 NFL Draft.\nHe spent his rookie season recovering from the injury. On October 29, he was activated from the non-football injury list to the Cowboys active roster, taking the spot of the waived Tashard Choice. His participation was mostly limited to special teams, playing only a total of 41 defensive snaps.\n2012 season.\nEntering the 2012 season the team decided not to resign Keith Brooking and Bradie James, because they considered Carter to be ready to start at inside linebacker next to Sean Lee, after playing outside linebacker for most of his college career.\nThe Cowboys also signed Dan Connor as a free agent to compete with Carter and to protect themselves in case he couldn't earn a starting role. That potential competition never materialized, because Carter would end up having a break out year, even expanding his role after Lee was placed on injured reserve in October. He finished second on the team with 70 tackles, despite being placed on injured reserve for the final five games, after dislocating his left elbow on Thanksgiving Day.\n2013 season.\nIn 2013, defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin was hired to change the defense to a 4-3 alignment, so he was switched to weakside linebacker, which was the same role in the Tampa 2 defense made famous by hall of famer Derrick Brooks. Although he was seen as a natural fit and there were high expectations placed on him, he struggled in preseason, where he started being platooned with Ernie Sims. These difficulties carried on into the regular season and after a poor performance against the San Diego Chargers, he was benched for the first time at any level. After two games he regained his starter role over Sims and finished with 96 tackles (third on the team) and 2 sacks.\n2014 season.\nIn 2014, he was moved to strongside linebacker, so he could line behind the three-technique right defensive tackle position and be free to make plays. He suffered a right quadriceps injury against the New Orleans Saints and was lost for three games. Although his playing time was reduced in November, losing his starting role after the game against the Arizona Cardinals, he would finish strong while concentrating on the nickel defense and special teams, finishing with 68 tackles, 5 interceptions (led the team), 8 passes defensed and a blocked punt.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nOn March 11, 2015, he signed a four-year contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Although he was projected to start at middle linebacker, he was moved to sam linebacker, after rookie Kwon Alexander outperformed him in training camp. He was used mostly as a backup (only 3 starts), finishing with 47 tackles, 2 sacks and 2 passes defensed. On March 8, 2016, he was waived in a salary cap move.\nNew York Jets.\n2016 season.\nCarter signed a one-year contract with the New York Jets on April 2. He appeared in 13 games, registering 13 defensive tackles and 5 special teams tackles.\n2017 season.\nOn May 4, Carter re-signed with the Jets on a one-year contract. He played in 14 games.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nOn September 25, 2018, Carter was signed by the Atlanta Falcons.\nOn February 11, 2019, Carter signed a one-year contract extension with the Falcons. He was released on August 31, 2019."

        "text": "The Irish Exiles is a rugby union representative team featuring players selected from the Irish diaspora, many based in Great Britain. The team was established in 1989 by Tom Kiernan. It was officially recognised by the Irish Rugby Football Union and during the 1990s was effectively a fifth provincial team along with Leinster, Ulster, Munster and Connacht. Between 1992 and 1993 and 1995–96 the Irish Exiles entered the IRFU Interprovincial Championship. The Irish Exiles also acts as an academy system for players from the Irish diaspora who wish to play for the men's national team and other IRFU national teams including the women's national team, the men's sevens team and the women's sevens team. \nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe Irish Exiles organisation was originally established by Tom Kiernan in 1989 following a meeting in London. The aim of the Irish Exiles was to give Irish diaspora players wishing to represent the Ireland national rugby union team the opportunity to play for a representative team. The Irish Exiles subsequently became a formal sub-committee of the Irish Rugby Football Union. Kiernan became the first chairman of the Exiles organisation. His successors included Barry O'Driscoll. The Exiles would eventually become a full branch of the IRFU.\nIn addition to establishing a senior representative team, the Exiles also established under 21 and student teams. During their first two seasons the Exiles played friendlies against Ulster at Ravenhill and a Welsh Exiles XV. The first senior XV coach was Ken Kennedy. An under 21/student team also played the Ireland U21s at the London Irish ground in Sunbury-on-Thames. \nDuring the 1992–93 season an Irish Exiles XV also played an away friendly against the Basque Country national rugby union team.\nIRFU Interprovincial Championship.\nBetween 1992 and 1993 and 1995–96 the Irish Exiles entered the IRFU Interprovincial Championship. Before this Irish diaspora players, including Jim Staples, Simon Geoghegan and John O'Driscoll were usually invited to represent Connacht in the championship.\nStaples and Geoghegan subsequently represented the Exiles and O'Driscoll coached the team. Other Ireland internationals to represent the Exiles in the championship included David Curtis, Gary Halpin and Rob Saunders. Mat Keenan, a Western Samoa international also played for the Exiles in the competition.\nInterprovincial Championship Record (1992–1996).\n\"†Matches were played as part of the Irish Interprovincial Rugby Championship.\" &lt;br&gt; \n\"Correct as of 9 February 2021.\"\nAcademy.\nThe Irish Exiles operates as a scouting and recruitment programme for Irish diaspora players interested in playing for the Ireland national rugby union team, the Ireland women's national rugby union team, the Ireland national rugby sevens team and the Ireland women's national rugby sevens team. In addition to producing nearly thirty Ireland men's internationals, the Exiles programme has also produced three British and Irish Lions – Simon Easterby, Rob Henderson and Nick Popplewell. A number of Irish Exiles players have \"slipped through the net\" and have subsequently gone on to play for the England national rugby union team. These include Kieran Brookes, Paul Doran-Jones and Shane Geraghty. Recent graduates of the programme include Rhys Ruddock and Kieran Marmion.\nIn 2017 the IRFU attempted to \"professionalise\" the Exiles and introduced \"IQ rugby\" to the UK, managed by the High performance unit in Dublin. This was initially sold to supplement the Exiles operation, but soon disposed of the large volunteer base and caused a breakdown in long term relationships with areas previously deemed hotbeds of Irish rugby talent. This experiment has been viewed by many, both at home and in the UK, as a failure given the lack of players it has produced for age grade, provincial or senior international sides and is currently under review. There has been some vexation within the Irish rugby community at the continued funding of IQ rugby, who are deemed to have an excessive operating budget through the 20/21 pandemic, while failing to meet their sole objective. At a time when the union and provinces have seen multiple voluntary and compulsory redundancies, there has been an outcry to suspend their operations and use the money help fund the faltering grassroots game in Ireland, who have been hit hard by losses during the pandemic, and fully reinstate the Exiles control of talent identification in the UK which for many years was the envy of both the Scottish and Welsh unions.\nWomen's team.\nThe Irish Exiles also field a women's rugby union team. A number of prominent members of the Ireland women's national rugby union team have progressed through the Exiles programme. These include Sophie Spence and Claire Molloy."

        "text": "The General Beauregard Equestrian Statue, honoring P. G. T. Beauregard, was located in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. The statue, by Alexander Doyle, one of the premier American sculptors, was officially unveiled in 1915.\nIt was at the intersection of Carrollton Avenue and Esplanade Avenue at the main entrance to City Park, on Beauregard Circle. The statue was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 18, 1999.\nRemoval.\nOn June 24, 2015, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu acknowledged the impact of the June 2015 Charleston church shooting, and after talking with New Orleans jazz ambassador Wynton Marsalis, Landrieu called for the removal of several city memorials to Confederates.\nAs part of a sixty-day period for public comment, two city commissions accepted the Mayor's call for the removal of four monuments associated with the Confederacy, including statues of Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis and Beauregard, and an obelisk commemorating the Battle of Liberty Place. Governor Bobby Jindal opposed the removals.\nOn December 17, 2015, the New Orleans City Council voted 6-to-1 to remove the Gen. Beauregard Statue, along with three other historical monuments built 100 to 135 years ago. Mayor Landrieu announced that the removal of the monuments would happen within days.\nThe statue's removal began on May 16, 2017, and was completed on May 17.\nAfter the statue was removed, its pedestal remained in place. On July 25, 2018 after the base of the statue was removed, a time capsule was discovered to exist. The capsule was opened on August 3, 2018 and found to contain Confederate memorabilia, including photos of Confederate General Robert E. Lee and Confederate President Jefferson Davis, along with flags, currency, medals, ribbons and other paper items related to the city. Officials stated that the copper box was placed in the statue's pedestal on November 14, 1913, a year before the statue was erected."

        "text": "The Troy Trojans men's basketball program is the intercollegiate men's basketball of Troy University. The program is classified in NCAA Division I and the team competes in the Sun Belt Conference. The team currently plays their home games in Trojan Arena, which was built in 2012 and replaced the old arena known as Sartain Hall.\nHistory.\nTroy's first season was in 1950 under then head coach Buddy Brooks.\nThe Trojans appeared in the 2003 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as a 14-seed after winning the Atlantic Sun Conference tournament and faced 3-seeded Xavier in the first round, losing 71–59. The Trojans were the champions of the Atlantic Sun Conference in 2003 and defeated Central Florida for the conference tournament championship in Atlanta, Georgia.\nIn 2004, the Trojans were the Atlantic Sun Conference Regular Season Champions. That year, the Trojans made it all the way to the Atlantic Sun Tournament Championship game, only to lose a heart-breaker in the last minute to UCF by a score of 60–55. As regular season champions, Troy was given an automatic bid to the NIT Tournament where they would face Niagara in Buffalo, New York. Troy would lose to Niagara in the first round, 87–83. They finished with a 24–7 overall record. Following the season, Troy made the move to the Sun Belt Conference for all sports.\nFrom 2005–2008, Troy struggled to find the success that they enjoyed during their time in the Atlantic Sun Conference. Their new home in the Sun Belt Conference proved to be a challenge, with Troy going 51–69 over a stretch of four seasons.\nIn 2009, after finishing in 3rd place in the Sun Belt Conference, the Trojans would make their first post-season appearance since 2004 in the first annual CBI Tournament, where they would host the College of Charleston, only to lose in a thriller, 93–91. They would finish the season with a 19–13 record.\nIn 2010, Troy won their first ever Sun Belt Regular Season Title and made it to the Finals of Sun Belt Conference Tournament before losing in the last 30 seconds to North Texas, 66–63. The Trojans received an invite to the NIT Tournament where they would fall to Ole Miss in the first round, 84–65. The Trojans finished the 2010 season with a 20–13 (13–5) record, with big wins over in-state rival Auburn and Valparaiso.\nIn the inaugural opening game of the newly built Trojan Arena during the 2012 season, Troy had a record-crowd of 5,120 as they hosted Mississippi State, who was coming off of a 20-win season and an NIT appearance. Troy would upset the Bulldogs to open Trojan Arena, defeating them by a score of 56–53.\nIn 2017, under head coach Phil Cunningham, Troy made their way back to the NCAA tournament by winning the Sun Belt Conference Tournament, defeating Texas State 59–53. The team would be given a 15-seed, playing #2 seed Duke in the first round. Duke defeated Troy in that game by the score of 87–65. Troy finished the season with a 22–15 record.\nThe Trojan basketball team is recognized in recent Division I Basketball history for leading the nation in 3-pointers for seven different seasons (1992, 1994, 1995, 1996, 2004, 2005, and 2006), making 1068 3-pointers over the course of 89 games (11.66 per game) during those three seasons.\nBefore Troy's accession to Division I, Troy was one of the most successful basketball teams in Division II before they transitioned to Division I. In 1988, the team made it to the Elite 8 of the Division II Tournament before falling to Alaska-Anchorage, 77–72. Five years later, the team advanced all the way to the NCAA Division II national championship game against Cal-State Bakersfield, only to finish as runner-up by falling to the Roadrunners, 85–72.\nOne of Troy's most famous claims to fame, however, is their game against DeVry (when DeVry had athletics) on January 12, 1992 when the Trojans came out victorious by the NCAA-record score of 253–141. This game is the current highest-scoring game in NCAA basketball history.\n\"Trey State\".\nUnder head coach Don Maestri, Troy State led the nation in three-point shots attempted and three-point shots made for many years during the program's time in the NCAA's Division II. Maestri's run-and-gun style of play was very effective, even after Troy State transitioned to the NCAA's Division I. Because of this style of play, Troy State amassed 141 games where they scored 100 or more points, with a record of 122–19 when scoring more than 100 points during Maestri's tenure as head coach from 1982–2013.\nWhen Troy State began their first season in Division I in 1994, the program came in with a bang, ranking #2 in the nation in 3-pointers attempted and #5 in the nation in three-pointers made. Maestri and his Trojan teams never looked back from there. From 1994–2006, the Trojans finished #1 in the nation four times in 3-pointers attempted and 3-pointers made. Troy State also placed in the top five nationally of those same statistical categories eight times from 1994 to 2008. This led some newspaper and media outlets to give the basketball program the moniker \"Trey State.\"\nTroy currently holds the all-time NCAA record across all divisions for three-pointers attempted in a season, shooting 1,303 three-pointers during the 1991–1992 season.\nHighest scoring game in NCAA history.\nOn January 12, 1992, Troy State shattered a plethora of records during a match-up against the DeVry University Hoyas of the NAIA. The Trojans sported a 12–3 record while the DeVry Hoyas had a 3–15 record. After tip-off, Troy State scored their first basket after 54 seconds. The Trojans only had 15 points after the first three minutes. As the game settled into its soon-to-be record breaking groove, points came steadily; with 3:14 remaining in the first half, Troy eclipsed the 100-point mark.\nWithin the first three minutes of the second half, the Trojans scored 26 points and had already accumulated 149 overall with 17 minutes remaining. It was not until 6:35 into the second half that Troy State scored their first points of the half that were not three-pointers or dunks. With 10 minutes remaining, Chris Greasham's three-pointer gave Troy 189, eclipsing the previous NCAA single game scoring record of 187. Then, with 7:53 to go, Troy State surpassed the 200-point mark, becoming the first (and only) team in college basketball history to surpass the bicentennial threshold. The scoreboard in Troy's arena was not built to display 200+ points, and so when the moment occurred, it did not display the numbers correctly (their solution was to start over at zero and work their way back up from there). During the second half alone, the Trojans scored 135 points, besting their minutes-old record of 123, and the 30 three-pointers in the second stanza broke the NCAA all-time \"game\" record of 25 (set previously by Troy). Their 51 made three-point field goals more than doubled that record, and the 109 three-point attempts record has never been seriously contested.\nWhen the final buzzer sounded, Troy State had won the game by a record-breaking score of 258–141. The score of the game quickly made national headlines across the United States, from The Seattle Times to the Miami Herald, and even into other countries.\nThe game between Troy State and DeVry remains the highest single scoring game in NCAA history. Seven statisticians worked for 57 minutes after the game ended to complete its box score. Among records considered unbreakable are total points between teams (399), points by one team in one half (135), and three-pointers made and attempted (51/109) by one team in a single game. That season, Troy State compiled a 23–6 overall record while setting many school records along the way, including single season scoring average (121.0), field goals made and attempted (1,274/2,839), three-pointers made and attempted (444/1,303), and steals (460). They also set single game records of points (258), points in a half (135), field goals made and attempted (102/190), rebounds (94), assists (65), and total points between teams.\nConference titles.\nTroy has won a total of 14 combined conference regular season and tournament titles. Troy's most successful stretch of conference titles came while being a member of the Atlantic Sun Conference, winning the regular season titles four out of five seasons from 2000 to 2004.\nFacilities.\nSartain Hall (1962–2012).\nSartain Hall is a 4,000-seat multi-purpose arena in Troy, Alabama. It was home to the Troy University Trojans basketball team until Trojan Arena opened in 2012. It opened in 1962.\nThe building was built as a new Physical Education Building in 1962, with its major facility being a 2,500-seat basketball gymnasium which was ready for the first basketball game that fall. \nBefore Sartain Hall, the university never previously had an adequate gymnasium, and the college administration had the foresight at the time to make it available for high school basketball tournaments as well as college games and tournaments. The building is named in honor of the late Professor Auxford Sartain. \nIn 2012, Sartain Hall was no longer used for basketball activities since the newly built Trojan Arena had opened. It was used as a multi-purpose student recreation facility until its demolition in 2018.\nTrojan Arena (2012–present).\nTrojan Arena is a 6,000 seat arena that is home to the Troy men's and women's basketball, volleyball and track programs. The arena is also used for the university's commencement ceremonies and special events. Trojan Arena replaces the university's longtime basketball and events facility, Sartain Hall, which opened in 1962.\nThe facility was constructed with architectural direction by Goodwyn, Mills and Cawood and design support by venue specialists Populous, noted for its designs of such sporting venues as Yankee Stadium in New York City, the main stadium for the 2012 London Olympic Games and Nanjing Sports Park in China.\nTrojan Arena seating features 5,200 chair-back seats, seven upper-level suites and an exclusive Stadium Club area for donors, while also having floor seating for students. The arena features an LED ribbon board that circles around the entire arena, one of only two of its kind in the Sun Belt Conference. Daktronics designed, manufactured, and installed two 767-square-foot LED video/scoring system boards, the largest end-wall boards produced by Daktronics for an indoor college facility.\nUnder the main playing court sits a 10,000 sq ft area of basketball practice courts. These facilities are shared by both the men's and women's basketball teams, as well as the indoor women's volley team.\nAmong the other features of the new arena are a three-tiered rotunda at the main entrance, an interior concourse with concession stands and a food court-styled dining center with specialty food items.\nPostseason results.\nTroy currently possesses an all-time record of 11–14 in postseason tournaments.\nNCAA Division I Tournament results.\nThe Trojans have appeared in the NCAA Division I Tournament two times. Their combined record is 0–2.\nNIT results.\nThe Trojans have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) two times. Their combined record is 0–2.\nCBI results.\nThe Trojans have appeared in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) two times. Their record is 0–2.\nNCAA Division II Tournament results.\nThe Trojans have appeared in the NCAA Division II Tournament five times. Their combined record is 10–6.\nNAIA Tournament results.\nThe Trojans have appeared in the NAIA Tournament three times. Their combined record is 0–3.\nYearly results.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinal rankings.\nAlthough Troy has never been ranked in the Top 25 since joining Division I, the Trojans were a mainstay in the rankings during their time in Division II. They were typically ranked in the NCAA Top 25 during the regular seasons, but fell out of the rankings toward the end of the season quite a few times. Only twice did the Trojans finish a season ranked in the Top 25 while in Division II.\nSource:\nRivalries.\nTroy vs. South Alabama.\nCurrently, one of Troy's biggest rivals in basketball is with in-state foe South Alabama. The Jaguars currently hold an 11–23 advantage in the all-time series over the Trojans.\nTroy vs. Georgia State.\nTroy and Georgia State have met off and on since 1952. They began to play each other regularly when both programs were members of the Atlantic Sun Conference in the late 1990s, and again when Georgia State joined the Sun Belt Conference in 2013. Both programs have ties because of Charles \"Lefty\" Driesell, who was head coach of Georgia State from 1997 to 2003. Troy's former head coach, Phil Cunningham, was an assistant under Driesell during his time at Georgia State and James Madison. One of Driesell's grandsons, Michael Moynihan, was also a member of the Troy coaching staff under Phil Cunnungham for a few years.\nTroy currently holds a 27–22 edge in the all-time series over the Panthers.\nTroy vs. UCF.\nNow a dormant rivalry, Troy and UCF were once conference rivals and were considered the prominent rivalry during both school's tenure in the Atlantic Sun Conference. Both basketball programs routinely fought for the conference regular season and tournament titles before they both left the Atlantic Sun Conference in 2005. Troy currently leads the series with a 12–8 record."

        "title": "FIS Cross-Country World Cup",
        "text": "The FIS Cross-Country World Cup is an annual cross-country skiing competition, arranged by the International Ski Federation (FIS) since 1981. The competition was arranged unofficially between 1973 and 1981, although it received provisional recognition on the 31st FIS Congress, 29–30 April 1977 in Bariloche, Argentina.\nThe first World Cup races were held on 9 January 1982 and were located in Reit im Winkl, West Germany and Klingenthal, East Germany. Bill Koch of the United States and Berit Aunli of Norway were the overall winners in the first season.\nRules.\nCompetitors attempt to achieve the most points during the season. They compete in two disciplines: Distance and Sprint. Current Distance races are mostly 10 km, 20 km, Skiathlon and 50 km for the men and women. The competitions are held with either individual start or mass start and either classic or free technique. In Sprint races, athletes are organised in heats based on their results in a prologue where the 30 fastest skiers qualify for the sprint's quarter-finals. The 12 best skiers in the quarter-finals advance to the semi-finals and the 6 best skiers in the semi-finals advance to the final. Sprint races are maximum 1.8 kilometres and are competed in either classic or free technique.\nIn ordinary World Cup races, 100 points are awarded to the winner, 95 for second place, 90 for third place, winding down to 1 point for 50th place. In Stage World Cup races; Tour de Ski, World Cup Final and mini-tours, 50 points are awarded to the winner, 47 for second place, 44 for third place, winding down to 1 point for 30th place. The overall winners of the Stage World Cup events are awarded 300 points for Tour de Ski victory and 200 points for an overall win in the World Cup Final or a mini-tour. The athlete with the most points at the end of the season in mid-March wins the Overall World Cup, with the trophy consisting of a 9 kilogram crystal globe. Sub-prizes are also awarded to the winners of the Sprint World Cup and the Distance World Cup, with a smaller 3.5 kg crystal globe.\nRaces are hosted primarily in Europe, with regular stops in the Nordic countries and Central Europe. A few races have also been held in North America and Asia. World Cup competitions have been hosted in 23 countries around the world: Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Czechoslovakia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Soviet Union, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States. (Note that all World Cup races hosted in Bosnia were held when it was still part of Yugoslavia.)\nThe World Cup usually follows a November-March schedule, effectively ruling out hosting races in the southern hemisphere, for example in Argentina or New Zealand. Additionally, races have yet to be hosted in the Central Asia-Himalayas region.\nOverall World Cup standings.\nThe table below shows the three highest ranked skiers each year.\nNations Cup.\nAll results of female and male athletes of a nation are counted for the Nations Cup.\nMost World Cup wins.\nWorld Cup wins by nation.\nThe table below lists those nations which have won at least one individual World Cup race."

It was held from 3 to 7 December at the Melbourne Festival Hall. There were 63 competitors from 18 nations (down sharply from the 185 gymnasts in 1952), with nations in the team competition having up to 6 gymnasts and other nations entering up to 3 gymnasts. The event was won by Helmut Bantz of the United Team of Germany and Valentin Muratov of the Soviet Union, who tied for the top place.

Seven of the top 12 (including ties for 9th) gymnasts from 1952 returned: gold medalist Viktor Chukarin of the Soviet Union, silver medalist Masao Takemoto and bronze medalist Takashi Ono of Japan, and fifth-place finisher Theo Wied of Germany (now the United Team of Germany). The reigning (1954) world champion, Leo Sotorník of Czechoslovakia, did not compete in Melbourne, but the runner-up (Helmut Bantz of the United Team of Germany) did.\nAustralia and Canada each made their debut in the men's vault; East and West Germany competed together as the United Team of Germany for the first time. The United States made its eighth appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe gymnastics format continued to use the aggregation format, mostly following the scoring tweaks made in 1952. Each nation entered either a team of six gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. The event used a \"vaulting horse\" aligned parallel to the gymnast's run (rather than the modern \"vaulting table\" in use since 2004). All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The 2 exercise scores were summed to give an apparatus total. No separate finals were contested.\nExercise scores ranged from 0 to 10 and apparatus scores from 0 to 20."

        "text": "The 2010 Super League Grand Final was the 13th official Grand Final and conclusive and championship-deciding game of Super League XV. Held on Saturday 2 October 2010, at Manchester's Old Trafford stadium, the match was contested by English clubs St. Helens and Wigan Warriors. The final saw Wigan, who also finished League leaders, win 22-10, taking over the crown of Super League champions from the Leeds Rhinos, who had held the title for 3 years. This was St. Helens' fifth consecutive Grand Final and their fourth consecutive Grand Final defeat, having won in 2006 and then lost three Grand Finals to Leeds between 2007 and 2009.\nPre-match.\nPre-match entertainment was provided by a performance from Diana Vickers. Rhydian Roberts sang Jerusalem and then a minute's silence was also observed for Terry Newton who had died the previous weekend before St Helens, wearing blue with white (as both sides' traditional colours are red and white), kicked off.\nMatch details.\nWigan's captain, Sean O'Loughlin, was the only player who also played in his team's previous grand final in 2003.\nIn the fourth minute Wigan were twelve metres out from St Helens' try-line when, on the fifth tackle, they passed it through the hands out to the right side where centre Martin Gleeson forced his way through the defence. The video referee awarded the try and Pat Richards' conversion attempt missed so the Cherry &amp; Whites were in front 4-0. At the fifteen-minute mark Wigan were working the ball out of their own half when they again moved the ball out to the right where Sam Tomkins made a break and then passed back inside to Thomas Leuluai in support. Leuluai then passed to Deacon who passed for Gleeson to cross untouched, putting the ball down behind the uprights for his second try. Richards kicked the simple conversion so Wigan were in front 10-0. About three minutes later Wigan had again made their way up to within spitting distance of St Helens' try line where they passed the ball quickly out to right winger Darrell Goulding to dive over in the corner untouched. Richards' sideline conversion was successful so The Warriors now led 16-0 with little over a quarter of the match gone. In the twenty-eighth minute St Helens had managed to make their way up inside Wigan's ten-metre line where Jon Wilkin got the ball and ran back inside across the defensive line, passing to Andrew Dixon who ran untouched through a gap for a close-range try. The simple conversion was kicked by Jamie Foster so St Helens were trailing 16-6. No more points were scored in the remaining minutes so this was the half-time score.\nPat Richards did not return to the field after the break due to an Achilles tendon injury. In the fourth minute of the second half, Wigan were almost over St Helens' twenty-metre line when the ball went to Leuluai who dummied his way through a gap in the defence and managed to evade several more tacklers before clambering his way to the try line where it was ruled by the video referee that the ball was stripped from him. A penalty was awarded to Wigan and the option to kick was taken, but Riddell missed. St Helens then enjoyed some possession but failed to convert their chances into points before Wigan were on the attack again by the fifty-third minute. From twelve metres out the ball was played and passed right, finding Sam Tomkins who dummied and took on the defensive line, somehow managing to maintain his momentum and reach out of a two-man tackle to plant the ball over the line. Riddell missed the conversion attempt badly so Wigan were leading 20-6. A few minutes later the Cherry &amp; Whites got a penalty in an easy kicking position and Riddell got the two points, extending the lead to 22-6. In the sixtieth minute Wigan crossed St Helens' line again but it was called back by the video referee due to obstruction. Wigan were awarded a penalty ten minutes later and took the kick, but Tomkins' attempt missed, leaving the margin at sixteen points with ten minutes of the game remaining. In the seventy-fourth minute St Helens had made it into the opposition's quarter of the field where they swung the ball out to Francis Meli to score on the left wing. Foster missed the sideline conversion attempt, so the score was 22-10 in favour of Wigan. No more points were scored in the remaining minutes of the match so it was Wigan who celebrated their first championship since 1998.\nThomas Leuluai was awarded the Harry Sunderland Trophy as the Grand Final's man-of-the-match. Wigan's new Australian coach Michael Maguire had won a championship in his first season as a head coach. For St Helens' it was their fourth consecutive grand final defeat and a disappointing exit from the game for their retiring captain Keiron Cunningham in his 496th game.\nWigan's celebrations continued the following day with the team's open-top bus tour from JJB Sports HQ at Martland Park into Market Place, Wigan attracting thousands of fans despite rainy weather.\n2011 World Club Challenge.\nBy winning the grand final, the Wigan Warriors had earned the right to play against the 2010 NRL grand final-winners, the St. George Illawarra Dragons in the 2011 World Club Challenge in February."

It was built for the 2011 Cricket World Cup and hosted two matches, the first being Sri Lanka against Canada, on 20 February 2011. The stadium has a capacity of 35,000 people making It the second largest stadium in Sri Lanka.\nHistory.\nThe proposal for a new International Cricket Stadium at Sooriyawewa was part of the government's programme to develop sports in the Southern Province of Sri Lanka as part of the government's plan to transform Hambantota into the second major urban hub of Sri Lanka, away from Colombo.\nThe following 2011 Cricket World Cup matches were held at Hambantota International Cricket Stadium in February 2011.

The curator of the ground is Ravi Dissanayake and Manager is Colonel Shanaka Ratnayake.\nCriticism.\nWith low coverage of international matches in very rural areas, it has come under extreme criticism and has been called a white elephant as only a few matches were held in the stadium considering the extreme costs for construction and maintenance. The ministers of opposition criticize that former government has hidden the true story of actual cost for its construction. To gain revenue the Stadium is often hired out for wedding receptions, however, former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has proposed that the stadium should be used for training purposes to gain revenue.\nIn 2016, after the inspections by Sri Lanka Cricket, president Thilanga Sumathipala pointed out that the walls, carpets, furniture and equipment in the stadium were in a severe state of neglect and deterioration without any attempt to revive the facility to its earlier status.\nLanka Premier League.\nInitially, 2020 Lanka Premier League was scheduled to be held in Kandy, Dambulla and Hambantota. Due to COVID-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka, health officials agreed to reduce the quarantine period for foreign players from 14 days to 7 days.

        "text": "The 2009–10 Memphis Tigers men's basketball team represented the University of Memphis in the 2009–10 college basketball season, the 89th season of Tiger basketball. The Tigers were coached by first-year head coach Josh Pastner, played their home games at the FedExForum in Memphis, Tennessee and are members of Conference USA. They finished the season 24–10, 13–3 in C-USA play. They were the 2 seed in the 2010 Conference USA men's basketball tournament where they were upset by 7 seed and eventual champion Houston. They failed to be invited to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2005. Instead, the Tigers were invited to the 2010 National Invitation Tournament where they advanced to the second round before losing to the Ole Miss Rebels.\nPreseason.\nThe 2008–09 Memphis Tigers finished the season 33–4 (16–0), as Conference USA regular season and tournament champions. After three early losses, the Tigers went on a 27-game unbeaten streak, finally coming to an end with a season-ending 102–91 loss to the Missouri Tigers in the Sweet 16. Memphis finished the season ranked 9th in the final Coaches' Poll and 3rd in the AP Poll.\nA turbulent offseason for the Tigers began with the news of Billy Gillispie's firing at the University of Kentucky. Despite assurances that “Memphis is where I want to coach,” John Calipari resigned as head coach of the Tigers to take the job at Kentucky on March 31, 2009. After a week-long coaching search, Memphis athletic director R.C. Johnson announced the hiring of former Arizona and Memphis assistant Josh Pastner as head basketball coach. At 32 years of age, Coach Pastner is the second-youngest men's head basketball coach in the NCAA.\nCalipari's departure resulted in the disintegration of Memphis' recruiting class. Signed recruits DeMarcus Cousins and Darnell Dodson were allowed out of their letters of intent and followed Calipari to Kentucky. Xavier Henry was also allowed to leave, and while briefly considering following Calipari as well, ultimately decided to attend the University of Kansas. Guard Nolan Dennis was also allowed to leave, choosing to attend Baylor University. Of Memphis' original 2009 recruiting class, only JUCO forward Will Coleman decided to honor his commitment to play for the Tigers. Sophomore forward Ángel García lost most of the season with an ACL tear, but made an unexpected debut after only five months of recovery. Despite shooting 52% in 2-point field goals and 41% in 3-point field goals, García saw limited action due to the recovery process.\nMemphis' roster was also devastated by other departures not directly related to the coaching change. Redshirt freshman C. J. Henry, brother of Xavier Henry, chose to transfer to Kansas to play with his brother after sitting out the season due to an ankle injury. Memphis recruit Latavious Williams decided not to honor his commitment, instead deciding to play professionally in China; ultimately, Williams was drafted into the NBA Development League. On March 31, 2009, freshman sensation Tyreke Evans declared himself eligible for the 2009 NBA draft, ultimately being drafted 4th overall by the Sacramento Kings. Senior forward Shawn Taggart declared for the draft on June 6, 2009, despite having one year of eligibility remaining. Seniors Antonio Anderson and Robert Dozier also declared for the draft after their graduation from the University; Chance McGrady, brother of Houston Rockets guard Tracy McGrady also graduated, but did not declare for the draft.\nThe Tigers began the 2009–10 season on October 16, 2009 with Memphis Madness. Over 18,000 fans attended the free event at FedExForum, with several hundred fans turned away at the door by the Memphis Fire Department for safety reasons. The capacity crowd was the largest to ever witness a Memphis Madness event.\nDepartures.\n\"Statistics accurate as of 29 March 2010.\"\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9| Exhibition\n!colspan=9| Regular Season\n!colspan=9| 2010 Conference USA tournament\n!colspan=9| 2010 National Invitation Tournament"

        "text": "The Chinese Basketball Association (), often abbreviated as CBA, is a national non-profit sports organisation in China. It represents China in the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) and FIBA Asia, as well as the sport of basketball in the All-China Sports Federation.\nGovernance.\nBasketball in China is officially governed by both the Chinese Basketball Management Centre (CBMC), a division of the State General Administration of Sports and the CBA, which is the nationwide non-governmental sports organisation and non-profit association that manages the country's premier CBA League (and not the same as this organization). In practice the same officials are at both organisations, ensuring government control of the supposedly commercial operation.\nChinese basketball legend and former Shanghai Sharks owner Yao Ming has long held ambitions to reform the structure of Chinese basketball to address shortcomings in team management, development, training and facilities and to make it more commercially successful. As a member of the CPPCC he has each year since 2013 proposed reforms, unsuccessfully.\nIn February 2017 at the CBA national congress, Yao was unanimously elected president of the association – the first time a non-official had ever taken up the post. Five days after taking up the post, Yao submitted a proposal to the Chinese Basketball Association comprising three major reforms: split the league into two conferences and increase the number of games; limit the time that players spent training for the national team and adopt the invitation system used by the NBA; and put a cap on the court time of non-Chinese Asian players.\nThe plan was reportedly rejected and hushed up. However, at least one of the proposals was eventually implemented—an expansion of the CBA league schedule from 36 to 46 games."

It hosted maritime artworks, lifelike wax figures of sailing icons (a saluting Dennis Conner, John Cox Stevens, Sir Thomas Lipton &amp; more), while the main exhibition area was circled with pennants from clubs around the world. The Museum also housed the Peninsula Art Gallery which sold prints, the Boardwalk coffee shop and Rolly Tasker Sails Australia which offered sails made by Rolly.\nThe opening address on Monday 7 April 2008 was made by Major General Michael Jeffery AC CVO MC, Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, who opened the museum on Rolly and Kerry Tasker's behalf.\nThe Museum housed an extensive array of built-to-scale model yachts in glass cases. The models were representative of most of the Australian and many international classes of yachts. The Australian sailing and Olympic sailing champions' achievements were listed. Wax figures circled the centre of the Museum while sailing history in text and pictures lined the walls.\nIt was listed as a 2009 WA Tourism Awards Finalist.\nFollowing the death of Rolly Tasker at the age of 86 in 2012, and after failing to find an organisation to take over the collection, his family transferred many of the contents to the WA Museum and Fremantle Maritime Museum, while others were sold at auction."

Nicknamed \"The Wall\" for his ability of \"... fending off the fiercest, the fastest and the wiliest of bowlers around the world\", he scored 36 centuries (scores of 100 runs or more) in Test cricket and 12 in One Day Internationals (ODI) between his debut in 1996 and retirement in 2011. He was named as one of the five \"Wisden\" Cricketers of the Year in 2000, as well as the ICC Test Player of the Year and ICC Player of the Year in 2004.\nDravid scored his first Test century in January 1997 against South Africa. In a man-of-the-match performance, he made 148 runs spanning nine hours and took India to their only draw of the series. He made centuries in both innings of a match when he scored 190 and 103 not out in the final Test of the 1998–99 series against New Zealand. He repeated the feat in March 2005 when he scored 110 and 135 against Pakistan in another man-of-the-match performance, leading India to victory in the second of the three-match series. Scoring 180 in a fifth-wicket partnership of 376 with VVS Laxman, in the Second Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in 2001, Dravid helped lead India to victory by 171 runs despite being asked to follow-on by the Australians. His partnership with Laxman was the third-highest for the fifth wicket in Test cricket history. Dravid's highest Test score of 270, achieved in April 2004 in Rawalpindi, helped India to an innings victory against Pakistan. The performance was the fourth-highest score by an Indian batsman in Test cricket. He scored centuries against all Test playing nations and was the first cricketer to score centuries in all 10 Test playing nations.\nDravid's first ODI century was made against Pakistan in May 1997. He followed that with six centuries in 1999, including two in the 1999 World Cup (against Kenya and Sri Lanka); in the latter he was involved in a then-record 318-run partnership with Sourav Ganguly. His highest score of 153 was made the same year against New Zealand. His total came as part of a record second-wicket partnership of 331 with Sachin Tendulkar and led India to the second-highest ODI total at that time."

A right-handed pitcher, he stood and weighed . Born in Hindsboro, Illinois, he was the father of professional baseball pitcher Rich Hyde.\nProfessional career.\nAfter going to tryout camps for the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals in 1947, Hyde was signed by the Washington Senators in 1949, pitching for their D level (then lowest) minor league team that year and the next before military service in Korea, followed by two more seasons of minor league ball for Washington. By 1954, Hyde had made very little progress in Washington's farm system. One day after watching him throw, Calvin Griffith suggested Hyde might become more effective if he came down a little in his pitching motion when he threw. Hyde eventually adopted the submarine style of pitching.\nWhile he made three appearances with the Senators in 1955, Hyde spent all of 1956 in the minors and it was only in 1957 that he established himself in the major leagues. His best year was 1958, when he went 10–3 with 19 saves and a 1.75 earned run average. He also finished 12th in the voting for Most Valuable Player. Hyde's Major League playing career ended with the Baltimore Orioles in 1961, though he finished his career in the Orioles' minor league system in 1962. Of the 169 games Hyde appeared in, all but two were as a relief pitcher.\nTransactions.\nHyde was purchased by the Baltimore Orioles from the Washington Senators on July 2, 1960. In 1959, Hyde was included in a trade between Washington and the Boston Red Sox. On June 11, Hyde and Herb Plews were sent to Boston for Murray Wall and Billy Consolo. When it was discovered Hyde had a sore arm, he and Wall were returned to their original teams.\nHyde died on April 15, 2020."

        "text": "Russia has participated in 4 FIFA World Cups since its independence in December 1991. The Russian Federation played their first international match against Mexico on 16 August 1992, winning 2–0. Their first participation in a World Cup was in the United States in 1994 where they achieved 18th place.\nIn 1946, the Soviet Union was accepted by FIFA and entered their first World Cup in Sweden 1958. The Soviet Union national football team played in 7 World Cups. Their best performance was reaching fourth place in England 1966. The USSR was dissolved in 1991 when Belarus, Russia and Ukraine declared independence under the Belavezha Accords, along with Georgia. The CIS national football team (Commonwealth of Independent States) was formed with other independent nations in 1992 for the purpose of competing in UEFA Euro 1992. Russia was recognized as the official successor of the Soviet Union by FIFA and inherited the records of the Soviet Union.\nRussia most recently qualified for the 2018 edition as hosts. They were banned from the 2022 edition during qualification. The last time Russia failed to qualify after a full qualification round was in 2010.\nOverview.\nHistory.\n Champions   Runners-up   Third place   Fourth place  \nRussia in Brazil 2014.\nRussia vs South Korea.\nThis was the first time the two countries have played each other in the FIFA World Cup, though they did play a friendly in 2013, which Russia won 2–1.

The 1958 FIFA World Cup in particular, which was the first one to be widely broadcast on television, had a major part in introducing Yashin's active and demanding goalkeeping style to the world at large.

        "title": "2012 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament",
        "text": "The 2012 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament began March 17 and concluded April 3, 2012. The Final Four was played at Pepsi Center in Denver. For only the second time in history, and the first time since 1989, all four of the number one seeds made it to the Final Four. Baylor won its second national championship, defeating Notre Dame 80–61 in the championship game. They were the only team to win 40 straight games in a season until Connecticut matched it in 2014.\nTournament procedure.\nPending any changes to the format, a total of 64 teams will enter the 2012 tournament. 32 automatic bids shall be awarded to each program that wins their conference's tournament. The remaining 36 bids are \"at-large\", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee. The tournament is split into four regional tournaments, and each regional has teams seeded from 1 to 16, with the committee ostensibly making every region as comparable to the others as possible. The top-seeded team in each region plays the #16 team, the #2 team plays the #15, etc. (meaning where the two seeds add up to 17, that team will be assigned to play another).\nThe basis for the subregionals returned to the approach used between 1982 and 2002; the top sixteen teams, as chosen in the bracket selection process, hosted the first two rounds on campus.\nThe Selection Committee will also seed the entire field from 1 to 64.\n2012 NCAA Tournament schedule and venues.\nThe format is similar to the Men's Tournament, except that there are 64 teams; this in turn means there is no \"First Four\" round. Thirty-one automatic bids for conference champions and 33 at-large bids were available.\nSubregionals were played from March 17 through March 20.\nFirst and Second rounds (Subregionals)\nThe following 16 sites were used for first- and second-round games:\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nThe Regionals, named for the city rather than the region of geographic importance since 2005, were held from March 24 to March 27 at these sites:\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)\nIt was the first time that Denver had hosted a Women's Final Four Basketball tournament.\nGame summaries.\nDes Moines Region.\nFirst round.\nBYU held a small, two-point lead at half-time, which evaporated when DePaul opened the second half with a 14–0 run. BYU chipped at the lead, and cut the lead to three points late in the game. With one second left in the game, the lead was three, and Haley Steed launched a three-point attempt that many, including BYU coach Jeff Judkins, thought it was going in. It did not, and DePaul secured the round, and hit a final foul shot to win the game, 59–55.\nThe last time Tennessee-Martin beat Tennessee, Pat Summitt, then Pat Head, was playing for the Tennessee-Martin team. Tennessee held Heather Butler to 14 points, almost ten points below her usual average, which made her the third leading scorer in the nation. Tennessee-Martin was held to under 30% shooting, and Tennessee won the opening round game 72–49.\nFlorida opened the game with a 9–0 run and lead 12–2 early in the game. Ohio State would play roughly even with Florida the rest of the way, occasionally cutting the margin, once to two points, but never taking the lead. Florida won in the match up between eight and nine seeds, 70–65.\nGeorgetown extended a ten-point halftime lead to 17, but gave most of the lead back. Fresno State cut the lead to three, and had possession of the ball with a chance to tie the game. Fresno State turned the ball over on several of their final possessions, while Georgetown missed free throws to keep the outcome in doubt until the final seconds. The Hoyas hung on to win 61–56.\nBrittney Griner only played 22 minutes, but she wasn't needed in an easy win against UC Santa Barbara. The Bears cruised to a 30 points margin in the first half and Baylor easily beat the Gauchos 81–40.\nSydney Wallace, a freshman at Georgia Tech, scored 28 points, in a match up against Sacred Heart. The Yellow Jackets build a large lead early, and were never threatened again by the Pioneers, who were playing in their third NCAA tournament since 2006 but still looking for their first won. The final score was 76–50.\nIn her first NCAA appearance, Elena Delle Donne had 39 points when she was removed from the game by her coach. At the time, the opposing team, Arkansas, Little Rock, had not yet scored 39 points. They would go on to score a total of 42, but the Fightin' Blue Hens of Delaware scored 73, to win their first ever NCAA tournament game.\nKansas hasn't been to the NCAA tournament since 1999. They narrowly made the field, but were going through a rough patch, losing all but two of their final eight games, and losing their leading scorer, Carolyn Davis, to a season-ending knee injury. Despite facing a higher seeded team in Nebraska, they managed to outscore their opponents and beat the Huskers 57–49.\nSecond round.\nThe game between Tennessee and DePaul was a rematch of an earlier season game played at the Maggie Dixon Classic, won by Tennessee 84–61. In that game, starting point guard Ariel Massengale was not available due to injury, while DePaul's Keisha Hampton scored 14 for DePaul. Since that match up, Massengale returned from injury, and Hampton was lost to a season-ending injury. Despite the changes in available players, DePaul stayed close to the Volunteers in the first half, ending the half with a five-point deficit. Tennessee's Glory Johnson had a career-high 21 rebounds to help Tennessee pull away in the second half, and the Volunteers won, 63–48.\nBrittney Griner went almost twelve minutes before scoring, but ended up with 25 points. She only had eight points in the first half, when Baylor pulled to a nine-point margin over Florida. The Lady Bears extended the margin to 13 in the opening minutes of the second half, and the Gators were never close again. The final score was in favor of Baylor, 76–57.\nGeorgia Tech is no stranger to the NCAA tournament, but had never advanced beyond the second round. This year's team set a record for victories in their conference, and overall victories, and received a 4 seed, their highest seed ever. The game against 5 seeded Georgetown was close early, but the Yellow Jackets pulled to a ten-point margin at halftime. The Hoyas were never closer than ten points in the final twelve minutes of the game, and Georgia Tech went on to win, 76–64.\nDelaware reached halftime with a six-point lead over eleventh seeded Kansas, but the Jayhawks came on strong in the second half. Even though The Blue Hens Elena Delle Donne would score 34 points, her teammates combined would contribute fewer points, and Kansas would start the second half with a 19–6 run to take the lead, which they would never relinquish. Kansas won 70–64 to advance to the Sweet Sixteen.\nSweet sixteen.\nKansas started the game against Tennessee with a strong performance, working their way out to a 14-point lead. The Volunteers would cut into the lead and reduce it to five at halftime. In the second half, the Tennessee team, behind 22 points off the bench from Meighan Simmons, and took over the lead, then extended it to double digits. Tennessee ended up with the win, 84–73.\nGeorgia Tech out scored Baylor by one in the second half, but that result was academic, as the Bears had out together a 16-point lead by halftime. Georgia Tech's Sydney Wallace scored 32 points, but Brittney Griner had 35 for Baylor to help lead them to a win, 83–68.\nElite eight.\nTennessee pulled out to an early 9–5 lead, but Baylor quickly responded. Brittney Griner was one block short of a triple double, and Baylor ended up winning by 19, 77–58. An incident occurred in the last minute of the game between Odyssey Sims and Shekinna Stricklen, resulting in a technical foul for each. Three players, including Griner, came off the bench, and were ejected. At the pro level, an ejection for leaving the bench brings with it a suspension for the subsequent game, but the rule is different in the NCAA. The loss prevented the Tennessee team from reaching the Final Four; the seniors in this class are the first class in Tennessee history to fail to make it to a Final Four.\nFresno Region.\nFirst round.\nEarly in the match up between top seeded Stanford and 16th seeded Hampton, the Pirates were staying close to the Cardinal, trailing at one time by one point, 22–21. However, Stanford then went on a 13–0 run, and the Pirates were never close again, falling 73–51.\nWest Virginia's leading rebounder, Ayana Dunning, picked up her fourth foul and headed to the bench less than six minutes into the second half. Texas, who were down 13 points at halftime, climbed back into the game, and cut the lead to three points. WVU's Taylor Palmer scored 13 of her overall 18 points in the second half, with one three-pointer coming after a five-minute stretch without any score by the Mountaineers. West Virginia then stretched out the lead, and won the game, 68–55.\nSouth Carolina faced Eastern Michigan, whose Tavelyn James is the second leading scorer in the nation at 24 points per game. The Gamecocks were effective on defense, holding James to just 11 points, and the entire team to 48. South Carolina went on to win 80–48.\nThe game plan of South Dakota State's head coach Aaron Johnston including containing Purdue's leading scorer Brittany Rayburn. That part of the plan was executed, as Rayburn scored 12 points. However, Johnston hadn't planned on the Boilermakers' Courtney Moses setting an NCAA record for three-pointers in a game. She hit nine, for 27 of her 29 points, helping lead the team to an 83–68 victory.\nVanderbilt is about forty miles from Middle Tennessee, but the two teams haven't played in twenty years. Vanderbilt moved out to a small seven-point lead at halftime, then went on a 20–5 run in the second half to put the game out of reach. Vanderbilt prevailed, 60–46.\nThe fourteen seed has never beaten a three seed, but Creighton came very close to breaking that streak. St. Johns had the ball and a two-point lead when pressure defense appeared to force the ball out of bounds. The St. Johns coach had called time out in time, but when the officials reviewed the replay, they noticed an elbow to the face by a St. Johns player. That gave two free throws to Creighton, and the ball. Creighton tied the game, but was unable to score on that possession. St. Johns had the ball with about five second left in the game, when Nadirah McKenith ran the length of the court, putting in a basket with 0.1 on the clock, securing the 69–67 victory.\nDuke's Elizabeth Williams is nursing a stress fracture, but still managed to be one of four Blue Devils with double-digit scoring. The game started with Duke pulling out to a 23–7 lead; Samford was never able to make the game close, in just its second appearance in the tournament.\nOklahoma's Aaryn Ellenberg played only seven minutes in the first half of the game because of foul trouble, but made up for it in the second half. She scored 28 points, playing on her home court, to help lead the Sooners to an 88–67 victory over Michigan.\nSecond round.\nWest Virginia played Stanford even in the second half, but they had been out scored by 17 in the first half, so the second half did not move them closer to their goal. Stanford had put together a 17–0 run in the first half, and that would match the halftime and final margin. The freshman point guard for the Cardinal, Amber Orrange took home scoring honors with 18 points, and had five assists while committing zero turnovers. The Cardinal beat the Mountaineers 72–55.\nDawn Staley, the South Carolina head coach, made it to the sweet sixteen several times as a player, but had not reached that level as a coach. They faced fourth seeded Purdue in a match up to determine who would advance to the sweet sixteen in the Fresno region. The Gamecocks held the Boilermakers to under 40% shooting for the game, and extended a seven-point half time lead to an eleven-point final margin, winning the game 72–61, and advancing to the regional game in Fresno, California.\nIt was unseasonably hot in Vanderbilt's Memorial Gym, both in terms of temperature and shooting. The gym does not have air conditioning, resulting in temperatures reaching the 90's. Duke hit 42 baskets in 65 attempts, just short of 66%. While the Commodores would score 80 points, the Blue Devils scored 96, to end up with a 16-point margin. Duke's Haley Peters set a career high mark with 25 points.\nSt. Johns took on Oklahoma on their home floor, where they were 8–1 in previous NCAA Tournament games. They allowed the Sooners to shoot almost 48% from the field and score 70 points. St. Johns had not won a game this year when giving up 70 points. Despite that, the Red Storm managed to score 74, so ended up with a win and a trip to the Sweet Sixteen.\nSweet sixteen.\nSt. John's would have the leading scorer of the game with Da'Shena Stevens, who scored 19 points, but the team as a whole shot under 35%, against Duke's 54%. The Blue Devils scored sixteen consecutive points in one run spanning halftime which put the game out of reach. Duke won 74–47.\nSouth Carolina stayed close to Stanford for much of their game, but could not overcome the Cardinal. The Ogwumike sisters filled the stat sheet with Nneka scoring 39 points and pulling down ten rebounds, while sister Chiney lead the team in blocks and steals. Stanford pulled away late, then used a 9–0 run to put the game out of reaching, winning the game 76–60.\nElite eight.\nOnce again, the Ogwumike sisters contributed significantly to a Stanford victory. Nneka scored 29 points, while younger sister Chiney was the rebounding leader with 17. The Cardinal pulled out to a 15-point lead at halftime. Although the Duke Blue Devils were able to outscore Stanford in the second half, they only reduced the final margin to twelve, 81–69.\nRaleigh Region.\nFirst round.\nArkansas faced a double-digit deficit in the first half, but pulled even by halftime. In the second half, the defense of Arkansas prevailing, holding the Dayton flyers to zero field goals in the last twelve minutes of the game. The Razorbacks won, 72–55.\nThe defending national champion Aggies held only a four-point lead at halftime over Albany, playing in its first ever NCAA Tournament appearance. The Great Danes were on a ten-game winning streak, but were unable to extend the run to eleven, as Texas A&amp;M extended the lead in the second half, and won 69–47.\nAfter not sleeping well, Maryland's Alyssa Thomas struggled in the first half. She only had five points in the first half, while her team missed five of its first seven shots and fell behind early 8–4. The Terrapins moved out to a seven-point lead over Navy by the half, and after coach Brenda Frese urged Thomas to settle down, Thomas scored a dozen in the second half, and help lead the team to a 59–44 victory over the Midshipmen.\nThe venue for Louisville's head coach Jeff Walz was familiar, as they were playing at Maryland, where he had served as an assistant coach for several years, including a national championship. The opponent were the Spartans, whose senior class had won at least one game in each of the prior three NCAA tournaments. The Cardinals would frustrate that streak, holding Michigan State to 55 points, and winning the game 67–55.\nThere have been nine wins by thirteen seeds in history, and Marist now has three of them. Free throws shooting (21–25) helped the Red Foxes win the biggest upset of the tournament so far. The Georgia Bulldogs out-rebounded Marist 33–27, and took 21 more field goal attempts, but over 50% shooting by Marist helped the Red Foxes defeat Georgia 79–70.\nNone of the players on the California team have competed in an NCAA tournament game, but the team did not show it early on, as they took a nine-point lead at the half, and built it to a 16-point lead in the second half. Iowa made a run, and cut the lead to seven, but cut not get closer, and lost to the Golden Bears, 84–74.\nNotre Dame scored the first eleven points before the two-minute mark, giving the Irish a chance to rest starters. The lead was 25 at halftime, and extended to a 31-point margin at the end, as Notre Dame beat Liberty 74–43.\nFlorida Gulf Coast, transitioning into NCAA Division I, took St. Bonaventure to overtime in the first NCAA appearance for both teams. The Eagles were on a 21-game winning streak and hit their 341st three-pointer of the season, setting an NCAA season record, but were unable to hold on to a double-digit lead. They were outscored in overtime by seven and ended up losing 72–65.\nSecond round.\nArkansas fell behind by double digits, then rallied against Dayton to win their first-round game. Against, Texas A&amp;M they fell behind by double digits again, with a 14-point deficits in the second half and rallied again, taking a one-point lead late in the game. However, this time the Razorbacks could not hold the lead, and the Aggies' Sydney Carter hit two free throws with 23 seconds left in the game to give the Aggies the win 61–59.\nThe Maryland-Louisville game set up a rematch between Jeff Walz, the head coach of Louisville, but former assistant at Maryland to Brenda Frese. Louisville had knocked Maryland out of the 2009 NCAA tournament, but this time the Terrapins would prevail. It was a close battle with an early lead by Louisville, then small leads by Maryland in the second half. Maryland held a three-point lead in the closing seconds when Becky Burke launched a potential tying shot that was tipped by Maryland. The Terrapins hit a final foul shot to win 72–68.\nSt. Bonaventure faced Marist in the second-round game. It is the first visit to the NCAA tournament for the Bonnies. Marist has been here before, but was the lowest seed left in the tournament. The two teams faced each other in the regular season, with St. Bonaventure winning by eleven in their December game. The result would be the same this time, but much closer, as Marist missed a closing seconds three-point shot that would have tied the game. The Bonnies beat the Red Foxes 66–63.\nCalifornia scored more field goals than Notre Dame, and made more three-pointers, but the Fighting Irish, playing on their home court, had more points from the free throw line. The game was tied at 31 all at halftime, but Notre Dame had an 8–2 run to open the second half. The Golden Bears tried to come back, but did not get closer than nine points in the late part of the game. Natalie Novosel hit 18 of her 20 free throw attempts, while the entire team hit almost 80% (26 for 33) in the game to end up with the win, 73–62.\nSweet sixteen.\nThe defending national champion Texas A&amp;M pulled out to an 18-point lead against Maryland. Although the Terrapins would cut the lead to three at the break, the Aggies stretched the lead back to 11 early in the second half. Maryland used a rebounding margin of 42–30 to earn more second chance points, and went on to win 81–74.\nSt. Bonaventure was never in the game with Notre Dame. The Irish started out on a 16–2 run. The Bonnies didn't get their second basket until more than halfway through the first half. Notre Dame shot over 50%, while holding the Bonnies to 19%. The Irish would go on to win easily 79–35.\nElite eight.\nNotre Dame's Skylar Diggins had a triple-double in points assists and rebound to help lead the Irish to a 31-point victory over Maryland. Although the game was close for the first few minutes, Notre Dame went on a 26–7 run to reach a 19-point margin by halftime, and stretched the margin in the second half, winning 80–49.\nKingston Region.\nFirst round.\nConnecticut started the game like they have in so many other first-round games, looking like a potential blowout. UConn scored the first eight points, before Prairie View hit an awkward three-pointer off the glass. However, The Lady Panthers stayed relatively close in the first half, cutting the lead to eight well into the game. Senior Tiffany Hayes, nursing a stress injury, played 17 minutes in the first half, but sat out the second half. Freshman Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis stepped up, scoring 21 points, tying a UConn record for points in their first NCAA appearance, held by former UConn player and current Cincinnati coach Jamelle Elliott. UConn stretched out the lead in the second half and won 83–47.\nPrinceton won the last three IVY league regular-season titles, which earned them an invitation to the tournament, but their regular-season performance earned a national ranking, the first time an Ivy League school has been in the AP ranking, so they were a nine seed, rather than the double-digit seeds usually awarded to automatic bids by the Ivy league. They played well against the eight-seeded Kansas State Wildcats, going on a 10–2 run to start the second half, and turn a small halftime deficit into a lead. However, Kansas State's Branshea Brown set a career record for points with 22 and helped the Wildcats hold on for a 67–64 victory.\nGonzaga, which had ridden graduated superstar Courtney Vandersloot to the regional final in 2011, picked up where it had left off a year earlier, achieving the only upset of the day. The Bulldogs, playing on their home court for the second straight year, pulled out to an early lead, with a score of 20–4 ten minutes into the game, and never relinquished the lead. Rutgers managed only one field goal in the first ten minutes of the game. Rutgers scored 50 points in the second half, but even the 28 points by Erica Wheeler were not enough to take over the lead. Gonzaga won, 86–73.\nMiami played without one of their top players, Riquna Williams, not present as a result of violating a team rule, but Shenise Johnson scored 20 points to help lead the team to victory over Idaho State. In addition to her points, Johnson had four steals, which made her only the second player in Division I NCAA history to record at least 2,000 points, 1,000 rebounds, 500 assists and 400 steals in a career. The only other player to achieve that level is Nancy Lieberman. The Hurricanes won the game, 70–41.\nAfter winning all but one game in the regular season and conference tournament, Green Bay felt they deserved better than a seven seed. The Phoenix opened the game playing better than a seven seed, and reached a 19-point lead by halftime. The Cyclones scored more points than Green Bay in the second half, but it was not enough to overcome that large lead, and Green Bay went on to win, 71–57.\nMcNeese State entered the tournament as a fifteen seed, knowing that a fifteen seed had never beaten a two seed in the women's tournament, and remembering that they lost in the opening round in the prior year by 40 points. Despite that, the Cowgirls were only down by three points at the half, and were within six points very late in the game, but could not complete the upset. Kentucky held on to win, 68–62.\nUTEP took more shots at the basket than Penn State, made a higher percentage of their shots, had a higher free throw percentage, out rebounded the Lady Lions by nine, had more assists and steals, yet did not outperform their opponents in the most important statistic: points. Penn State was behind much of the first half, and tied at halftime, but took a lead in the second half and ended up winning 85–77.\nSan Diego State was tied at halftime against LSU, then went on a 7–0 run to take a seven-point lead, but could not hold on to the lead. The Tigers came back, and pulled to an eight-point lead, which matched the final margin of the game, 64–56.\nSecond round.\nGonzaga was seeded eleventh, despite making it to the Elite Eight in 2011, possibly because Vandersloot had graduated. They still managed two upset wins to advance to the sweet sixteen. This time, they defeated Miami, holding the Hurricanes to under 33% shooting. Home floor and home fans may not have hurt either, as they beat Miami 65–54.\nKentucky pulled out to a 17-point lead at halftime against Green Bay, but managed to give up the entire lead in the second half. Turnovers plagued both teams, with 24 committed by the Phoenix and 34 by the Wildcats. Kentucky shot over 50% from the field, which helped to overcome the turnovers. Green Bay pulled ahead by one point with just under two minutes to play, but Kentucky responded with a basket, and Green Bay's final shot missed everything.\nAfter Connecticut scored the first basket of the game, Kansas State responded with a three-pointer taking a 3–2 lead. It would be their last point for over eleven minutes, and their last lead of the game. UConn played a game described as \"nearly...flawless defensive game\". The Wildcats scored just before halftime to increase their point total to ten, narrowly missing a tie for fewest points in the first half of an NCAA tournament game. They would not be so fortunate in avoiding the complete game record, set by Southern when they scored only 27 points in a game. The Kansas State team reached 26 points with almost three minutes left to play, but would not score again. The Huskies won 72–26.\nEven though Penn State started the game on a 9–0 run, the game against LSU game was close through much of the game, with a tie score ten different times. LSU was playing on their home floor, and managed a slim, one-point led at halftime. Their lead was as much as six points in the second half, but the Lady Lion's Maggie Lucas hit five of seven three-pointers, as part of a 30-point scoring effort, to help lead Penn State to a ten-point margin over LSU.\nSweet sixteen.\nGonzaga's Kayla Standish would score 25 points to be the high scorer in their game against Kentucky, but the threes of Kentucky, including five by Keyla Snowden, helped Kentucky win. The Wildcats hit 57% of their three-point attempts, almost as high as their (59%) free throw shooting. Kentucky would lead the game the entire way, winning 79–62.\nPenn State's Alex Bentley was asked about UConn after their win over Kansas State, and she said \"I don't think [the Huskies] played against a real, true scoring team\". UConn held the two guards, Bentley and Lucas to seven made shots on 31 attempts. In one notable sequence, Kelly Faris leaped to block a three-point attempt by Lucas. Caroline Doty grabbed the ball, and, with her back to her own basket and closely covered, leapt and spun to heave the ball to a streaking Faris, who had to be fouled hard to prevent a score. Bria Hartley would lead all scorers with 20 points, while Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis had a double-double in points and rebounds off the bench. The game was the 100th NCAA Tournament game in UConn history. UConn has a record of 84–16 in NCAA Tournament games.\nElite eight.\nConnecticut opened with a 9–0 run, but Kentucky did not quit, and responded, first closing the gap, then taking a small lead. When the Wildcats hit two free throws with 2.1 seconds in the first half to make the score 39 all, it looked like the score would be tied at halftime, but Tiffany Hayes hit a streaking Kelly Faris who put in a shot at the halftime buzzer to take a two-point lead. In the second half, the Huskies expanded the margin to 20 points, then ended with a 15-point victory, 80–65, to propel the UConn team to their fifth consecutive Final Four, tying an NCAA record.\nFinal four.\nSemi-finals.\nIn the first semi-final game of the evening, UConn faced Notre Dame for the fourth time this season. Notre Dame prevailed in the two regular season games, one of which went to overtime, while UConn won the match-up in the Big East tournament Finals. The Huskies scored first, but Notre Dame quickly responded with seven straight points. The game was close through most of the first half, with UConn holding on to a small three-point halftime lead. The Irish scored the first five points of the second half to take the lead, and would hold on to a slim lead for much of the rest of the half. With under three minutes left in the half, Notre Dame had a six-point lead, but UConn managed to come back and took a two-point lead with eleven seconds left, but Notre Dame responded to force overtime. Although UConn started the overtime period with a three-point basket, the Irish responded with three-point baskets, one by Diggins, then two by Mallory, to put the game out of reach. The final score in favor of Notre Dame was 83–75.\nIn the second semi-final, Baylor faced Stanford. Baylor had played, and beaten the other two Final Four participants, but had not played against the Cardinal. The Stanford team was playing in their fifth consecutive Final Four. Stanford's coach, Tara VanDerveer was faced with the challenge of stopping a team with outside and inside threats. The inside threat, Brittney Griner, would be named (the following day) the winner of three national player of the year awards, the Naismith, the Wade Trophy and the WBCA defensive player of the year. VanDerveer chose to emphasize defense on Griner and it had some success, as Griner was limited to seven points in the first half, and the outside shooters did not take advantage. The Cardinal were down at the half, but by only two points. Stanford's Nneka Ogwumike would be the leading scorer for the game, with 22 points, but she was the only double-digit scorer for the Cardinal, while Baylor had three players in double digits. Baylor would go on to the national championship game with a 59–47 victory.\nBracket.\n\"Unless otherwise noted, all times listed are Eastern \"Daylight\" Time ()\"\nAll first- and second-round games aired on ESPN2.\nRecord by conference.\nSource\nMedia coverage.\nTelevision.\nESPN had US television rights to all games during the tournament.

        "text": "The 2013 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament was played from March 23 through April 9, 2013. Tennessee continued its streak of making every NCAA women's basketball tournament at 32 consecutive appearances. Kansas made the regional semifinals for the second year in a row as a double-digit seed, UConn made it into the Final Four for the sixth consecutive year, the longest such streak, and Louisville became the first team seeded lower than fourth in a region to advance to the championship game. For the first time in tournament history, the same four teams were #1 seeds as in the previous year.\nTournament procedure.\nPending any changes to the format, a total of 64 teams will enter the 2019 tournament. 32 automatic bids shall be awarded to each program that wins their conference's tournament. The remaining 32 bids are \"at-large\", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee. The tournament is split into four regional tournaments, and each regional has teams seeded from 1 to 16, with the committee ostensibly making every region as comparable to the others as possible. The top-seeded team in each region plays the #16 team, the #2 team plays the #15, etc. (meaning where the two seeds add up to 17, that team will be assigned to play another).\nThe Selection Committee will also seed the entire field from 1 to 64.\n2013 NCAA Tournament schedule and venues.\nThe format is similar to the Men's Tournament, except that there are 64 teams; this in turn means there is no \"First Four\" round. Thirty-one automatic bids for conference champions and 33 at-large bids were available.\nThe subregionals were played from March 23 through March 26.\nSites chosen to host first- and second-round games in 2013 include:\nFirst round and Second Rounds (Subregionals)\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nThe Regionals, named for the city rather than the region of geographic importance since 2005, held from March 30 to April 2, were at these sites:\nA regional had been scheduled at Sun National Bank Center in Trenton, New Jersey. However, the NCAA moved the regional to Connecticut because of a recently passed state law allowing single-game betting for professional and collegiate games. NCAA rules do not allow tournament events to be held in states that allow single-game betting.\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)\nThis is the third time that New Orleans has been selected as a women's Final Four location (previously, in 1991 and 2004) and second time at the Smoothie King Center (previously named Kiefer Lakefront UNO Arena); the 1991 Final Four was contested at the University of New Orleans' Lakefront Arena.\nQualified teams.\nAutomatic qualifiers.\nThe following teams were automatic qualifiers for the 2013 NCAA field by virtue of winning their conference's tournament (except for the Ivy League, whose regular-season champion received the automatic bid).\nTournament seeds.\n\"Kentucky vs. Navy, Oklahoma State vs. Duke, and Notre Dame vs. Iowa aired on ESPNU. Purdue vs. Louisville aired on ESPNEWS. All other first and second round games aired on ESPN2\"\nGame summaries.\nOklahoma City Regional.\nAlmost all first-round games were won by the higher-seeded team except for Creighton, the 10 seed who upset Syracuse 61–56. The top seed, Baylor won easily, by 42 points over Prairie View A&amp;M. The only other game within single digit margin was 6 seed Oklahoma beating Central Michigan by five points.\nIn the second round, three of the four games followed expectations, with the only upset being the 5 seed Louisville over 4 seed Purdue. In the third round, 2 seed Tennessee beat 6 seed Oklahoma as expected, but Louisville upset top seeded Baylor in a result some have called one of the greatest upsets in women's basketball history. Baylor won the national championship in 2012, going undefeated during the season, and had returned every starter. While they lost one game in the current regular season, point guard Odyssey Sims was injured early in that game. The team had not lost a game in two years when playing at full strength. Louisville, the third best team in the Big East, hit sixteen of 25 three-point attempts, and held Griner to 14 points, after she had averaged 33 points in the first two games.\nRecord by conference.\nSource\nMedia coverage.\nTelevision.\nESPN had US television rights to all games during the tournament.

The tournament took place at the conclusion of the 2009 season. Caledonia AIA entered as the tournament's defending champion. The tournament commenced on 17 November 2009 with 10 teams competing in single elimination matches and concluded with the final on 11 December.\nQualification.\nEvery team based on the island of Trinidad took part in the tournament, with Tobago United as the lone Pro League representative that did not participate. Seeding for this year's competition was determined by each team's league position following the 2009 season. The bottom four teams in the table, United Petrotrin, FC South End, St. Ann's Rangers, and Police entered the tournament in the qualifying round.\nThe two winning teams from the qualifying round will take on the top two seeds Joe Public and Caledonia AIA, respectively. The other four clubs that qualified for the Pro League Big Six also entered the Pro Bowl directly in the quarterfinals.\nSchedule.\nThe schedule for the 2009 Digicel Pro Bowl, as announced by the TT Pro League:\n†\"The winner will also receive an additional prize amount based on gate receipts from each match.\"\nResults.\nAll matches were played for 90 minutes duration, at the end of which if the match was still tied, penalty-kicks were used to determine the match winner.\nQualifying round.\nOn 17 November, St. Ann's Rangers pulled an upset over FC South End 1–0 with Josimar Belgrave providing the lone goal. In the other qualifying round match, Police also stunned United Petrotrin 2–1 to complete the teams in the quarterfinals.\nQuarterfinals.\nIn the quarterfinals on 20 November, Joe Public used four goals from 2009 Golden Boot winner, Kerry Baptiste, to a 9–1 win against Police. Ma Pau joined the \"Eastern Lions\" in the semifinals, with a win over W Connection at Manny Ramjohn Stadium. On the other side of the bracket, Caledonia AIA defeated St. Ann's Rangers by a score 5–0 following a hat-trick from Kendall Velox, while Defence Force provided the closest match in the round with their win over San Juan Jabloteh 2–1.\nSemifinals.\nOn 4 December, Joe Public and Caledonia AIA both registered 1–0 victories in the semifinals to advance to the final. The \"Eastern Lions\" used a Hayden Tinto goal in the thirteenth minute to upend Ma Pau. However, Caledonia AIA needed an 81st minute free kick from winger Kareem Joseph to defeat Defence Force.\nFinal.\nIn the final, Joe Public came from behind to earn a draw 1–1 in regulation time before Colombian goalkeeper Alejandro Figueroa saved a Caledonia AIA's Keon Daniel penalty kick to give Joe Public a 5–3 win from the penalty spot."

        "text": "The All-College Basketball Classic was a college basketball event that was played during the winter holidays in Oklahoma City from 1935 to 2016. The final events were held at the Chesapeake Energy Arena. The All-College followed a tournament format until 2000, it was replaced by non-conference games featuring the Oklahoma Sooners and Oklahoma State Cowboys. The All-College Basketball Classic preceded the NCAA, NIT, NAIA, and NBA tournaments.\nThe All-College Tournament was originally conceived by Henry P. Iba, the coach at Oklahoma A&amp;M, and Bus Ham, sports editor of \"The Oklahoman\". The original purpose of the tournament was to increase interest in high school basketball in Oklahoma, and thereby to improve the quality of the college teams in the state. The first tournament included 16 teams from Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas, and was played at Classen High School; Oklahoma A&amp;M won the first title game over Tulsa, 40–17. Two years later the tournament had grown to 32 teams. When the publisher of \"The Oklahoman\" made known its intention to end its sponsorship, the Oklahoma City All Sports Association was formed in 1957 to take over the tournament.\nThe size, sponsorship, and success of the tournament varied over the years, shrinking to four teams in 1981. In 1999 it had what one report called \"one of its worst fields ever\" with three small college programs along with Oklahoma. The last traditionally-formatted tournament was played in 2000, with Oklahoma beating SMU 79–78 in the title game. Beginning in 2001, the event switched to a \"classic\" format, with a pre-determined schedule and no title game. In 2013 the event included women's basketball for the first time, presenting a doubleheader featuring the Oklahoma State men's and women's teams each playing a game against an out-of-state foe."

        "title": "Terrence Lewis (basketball)",
        "text": "Terrence Lewis (born 20 October 1969) is an American-New Zealand former professional player who played the majority of his career in the National Basketball League for the Wellington Saints. He played two years of college basketball for Washington State before venturing to New Zealand. He also had stints in England, Taiwan, Turkey and the Philippines.\nCollege career.\nGraduating from Ramsay High School as the 1988 Alabama Mr. Basketball, Lewis was set to join Providence for his freshman college season, but later failed to meet the academic requirements of Proposition 48 after recording an ACT score of 14. Instead of sitting out a year at Providence, Lewis opted to go the junior college route and enrolled at Howard JC in Big Spring, Texas, where he earned first-team JUCO All-America honors after shooting 62.5 percent from the field and averaging close to 27 points per game as a sophomore in 1989–90. After his junior college eligibility ran short, Lewis committed to play for Washington State.\nIn two seasons for the Cougars, Lewis shot 40% (137-of-343) from three-point range. After helping WSU to the NIT in 1992, Lewis got a training camp look with the Seattle SuperSonics and then was steered by his agent to New Zealand.\nProfessional career.\nLewis landed with the Wellington Saints and averaged 29 points per game in his first season in 1993. He subsequently earned NBL All-Star Five honors that year, but noted his displeasure of the league's import focus, stating \"You were only allowed two imports per team and everything was focused on the imports and it could be frustrating because I'd get a teammate an open shot – an easy layup – and he'd give the ball right back to me. I wasn't there to be arrogant and take every shot.\"\nIt took four seasons for Lewis to run into an overseas basketball turmoil experience. Following the 1996 season, sponsorships dried up and the Saints merged with a team in nearby Hutt Valley – whose owner didn't have any use for Lewis. So he returned to the United States, had knee surgery and in the meantime – as he had during New Zealand off-seasons – he made cameos in other countries. He had a brief stint in the Philippines in 1994 and spent the 1995–96 season in Turkey.\nHaving earlier married a New Zealander, a return to the country seemed inevitable – and, sure enough, after another ownership shuffle, Lewis was a Saint again for the 1999 season. He later spent the 1999–2000 season in England playing for the Chester Jets.\nFollowing a salary dispute, Lewis jumped ship and joined the Canterbury Rams for the 2002 season where he dominated playing alongside John Whorton. He returned to Wellington in 2003 where he claimed his first and only championship, despite having two coaches quit and the team nearly folding for lack of money. Lewis finally left the Saints following the 2008 season after butting heads with coach Doug Marty.\nAfter hanging up the boots in late 2008, retirement did not sit well with Lewis, and in July 2009, he signed with the Southland Flyers for the National Provincial Championships. The Flyers went on to win the Open Men's championship with the help of Lewis.\nInternational career.\nIn 2000, Lewis began the process of becoming a naturalized citizen of New Zealand, and two years later joined the national team, the Tall Blacks – the highlight being a best-of-three tour against Yao Ming and the Chinese national team.\nPersonal life.\nLewis and his wife, New Zealander Alinthian Reedy, have two children: Terrence Jr. and Ebony Jordon. Lewis is now employed as an officer for the Aviation Security Service based at Wellington International Airport, New Zealand"

        "title": "Episode 1 (Ashes to Ashes series 1)",
        "text": "Episode 1 is the first episode of series 1 of the British science fiction/police procedural/drama television series \"Ashes to Ashes\", which is the sequel to \"Life on Mars\". It began broadcasting on BBC One on 7 February 2008.\nSynopsis.\n\"Ashes to Ashes\" tells the fictional story of Detective Inspector Alex Drake (Keeley Hawes), a police officer in service with London's Metropolitan Police. After being shot in 2008, Drake awakens in 1981.\nPlot.\nDI Alex Drake is driving her car, while her daughter Molly is reading Sam Tyler's experiences in 1973 in a Police document. It is revealed that he committed suicide. Alex gets a call that a man has taken someone hostage. She tells Molly to stay in the car.\nA police sergeant informs her that the hostage taker is Arthur Layton and that he had recently left prison. Drake tries to tell the sergeant that she was driving her daughter to school. But the sergeant informs her that Layton had asked for her.\nDrake approaches Layton while the armed response team arrives. She helps the hostage escape but is taken herself. Molly runs out worried for her mother. Layton takes Molly hostage and escapes. Drake gives chase and hears a bullet. Layton had disappeared and Molly was okay.\nLater on Drake by herself sits in her car and repeats the lyrics \"I'm happy. Hope you're happy too\" that Layton had spoken earlier. Then she discovers Layton in her back seat. He orders her to relax and drive.\nHe leads her through the docks. He rings up an unknown person and tells them that he has Tim and Caroline Price's daughter; Drake asks Layton, \"How do you know my parent's names?\" But the call brings up nothing. Drake tries to question him when they are in a disused ferry on the Thames, where she is shot.\nDrake sees images of the bullet and Layton, herself younger, her mum, a balloon, a clown, Layton, and the bullet. She begins to hear music (\"Vienna\" by Ultravox) and awakens on a brothel boat. She briskly runs off the boat as policemen rush past her. She tries to get help, believing herself to just been shot, but they believe she is a prostitute and ignore her. She makes her way to a road, where the Quattro appears speeding with music playing (\"Careless Memories\" by Duran Duran).\nShe is taken hostage by Edward Markham, when she is surprised that DCI Gene Hunt, DS Ray Carling, and DC Chris Skelton appear, looking exactly like Sam described except for the updated clothes (1980s). She convinces Markham to surrender and is taken to the Metropolitan police station, where she discovers that she has a life set up just like Sam Tyler did. She believes she is hallucinating and that everyone is just imaginary constructs. The CID and Alex Drake discover that Drake is their new DI, much to the CID's surprise (as they had thought that Drake was a prostitute). Drake finds out that the year is 1981.\nDrake, believing that Layton is the key, follows evidence to convict Layton in 1981 as the CID is trying to uncover a crime gang. Layton is taken down by Hunt, much to Drake's anger, as she believes that she had to tackle Layton herself to return to the future.\nContinuity with \"Life on Mars\".\nAs with its predecessor, the show's name originates from a David Bowie song from the era in which the programme is set. In this case, it is the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\".\nIn the final episode of \"Life on Mars\", Sam Tyler is shown recording his thoughts and experiences in 2006 for an unnamed colleague in psychological services. Dropping his final tape in the post, he explains that she is studying police officers who have undergone trauma.\nDuring the opening scenes of the first episode, it is revealed that Alex Drake is a police psychologist who has been studying Sam Tyler's suicide and the records of his life in his 1973 world. The episode begins with Alex's daughter, Molly, reading the transcription from Sam's tapes (his opening monologue from the \"Life on Mars\" episodes).\nUpon Drake being shot during a hostage situation in 2008, she awakens in 1981, where she is amazed to meet Gene Hunt, who was mentioned in Sam Tyler's case notes. As Drake has read the report of Sam Tyler's reality, she knows that telephones and radios carry messages from the present day to her and how she can see hallucinations of those that she loves.\nDuring the course of the first series, it is revealed that Sam Tyler returned to Manchester in 1973 after committing suicide in 2006. Tyler spent a further seven years in this alternate timeline, before crashing his car while pursuing robbery suspects, with his body never being recovered.\nThe 2nd-through-final episodes' opening credits begin with an explanatory monologue by Alex, closely following that of Sam on \"Life on Mars\".\nThe first season of each series repeatedly features fractured memories of the murder of a woman each protagonist witnessed his or her father commit when the protagonist was a child. Sam's memories, from 1973, are shown as grainy film; Alex's, from 1981, are depicted as home video complete with whirling sound of a VCR fast-forwarding and reversing the tape. Sam and Alex each re-live the scene as adults at the climax of the first-season finale.\nIn addition to DCI Gene Hunt, DS Ray Carling, and DC Chris Skelton being regulars on both series, other \"Life on Mars\" characters Nelson, Jackie Queen, and DCI Derek Litton make guest appearances. Sam and his widow, DC Annie Cartwright, are repeatedly referred to.\nSam and Alex each meet their respective parents and visit their own childhood homes and bedrooms. They both encounter other family and significant places, such as Sam's favourite aunt, the record store where he bought his first record, and the factory that will one day be the loft where he will live as a DCI; and Alex's foster father, future ex-husband, parents-in-law, and the bed on which she implies her younger self will be intimate.\nCultural references.\nThere is an entire scene with the children's characters Zippy and George (from \"Rainbow\") talking to Molly Drake.\nThe Clown Angel of Death's pierrot costume is modeled on David Bowie's costume in the music video and record jacket of \"Ashes to Ashes\".\nChris Skelton (Marshall Lancaster) and others sing \"Shaddap You Face\" by Joe Dolce, a 1981 novelty hit which parodies Italian English.\nThe scene where Alex Drake first meets Gene Hunt has a shot framing Hunt between Alex's legs. This is a reference to the promotional poster for the 1981 James Bond film \"For Your Eyes Only\". The poster is seen later on the wall of Hunt's office.\nThe boat on which Alex awakens in the middle of a party is named \"Lady Di\", according to the large name plaque she passes topside, and PS Viv James informs Gene by radio that Arthur Layton has a boat named \"Prince Charlie\". The episode takes place in July 1981, days prior to the 29 July 1981 wedding of Lady Diana Spencer to Prince Charles, which serves as a backdrop for the following episode.\nMusic.\nMusic featured in the episode includes :\nReferences.\nDVD – Ashes To Ashes Series 1, 2008, Kudos"

        "text": "\"Episode 2\" is the second episode of series 1 of the British science fiction/police procedural drama television series \"Ashes to Ashes\", which is the sequel to \"Life on Mars\". It began broadcasting on BBC One on 14 February 2008.\nSynopsis.\nAs the royal wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Di approaches, Hunt is determined to keep a protest about the Docklands redevelopment under control. Meanwhile, a DeLorean-driving playboy attracts Alex's attention and Danny comes up with the goods on a New Romantic night out. Guest starring Rupert Graves and Steve Strange.\nPlot.\nAlex is watching television when she sees her mum on the TV talking about a case she has done. All the officers are on high alert as Prince Charles and Lady Di are to be married in a couple of days. Gene and Alex go to talk to David Bonds who is protesting in his pub on the refurbishment of the East End. He agrees to not cause any trouble until after the royal wedding. Gene tries to force Alex to have her bottom stamped as property of the station, an apparent tradition in the Metropolitan Police where the male officers moon her afterward. Alex refuses. A message comes in from an apparent bomber after a stray dog is blown up by dynamite. The message says that 'next time it's moore' and although everyone else assumes it to be a spelling mistake, Alex notices the note's perfect grammar and says if they can get that right then they can spell correctly. Chris says Moore might refer to Bobby Moore but is dismissed. Shaz suggests Daniel Moore, a man who is redeveloping parts of the East End. Hunt assigns Chris to find which magazines the letters in the note came from.\nGene and Alex go to visit Moore who declines their offer of protection. Alex is immediately attracted to him. Back at CID, Chris has found the source of all the letters except the O's. Moore appears at the station and takes Alex for a drive in his De Lorean. When they park, Alex says she hears a ticking sound and they both struggle to get out of the locked car. The bomb turns out to be a fake to scare Danny and asks if the offer of protection still stands. Alex is visibly shaken by the fake bomb. Gene sends Alex home saying she is no good to them being in the state she's in. At a restaurant Alex asks if Danny will be able to surprise her and he takes her to the Blitz, a famous London nightclub of the era. They meet Shaz and Chris there and Alex is having a great time. She sees the Clown on the stage and follows him only to find him gone. The next day Alex tells Gene she recognises the weird 'O's in the letter and that they were on the shirt of Bonds' son. Gene is reluctant to bring the boy in until Alex agrees to let him stamp her bottom. He is arrested and questioned but doesn't say anything. Whilst Gene is trying to stamp Alex, the Bonds' representative arrives: Caroline Price, Alex's mother.\nChris comes back from Bonds' pub with another stick of dynamite and they question George again with Price in the room. The suspect is charged and Caroline asks Alex for a drink. She asks Alex to spy on her fellow male workers and when she refuses Caroline says she's glad the only thing Alex shares with her daughter is her name because she would be ashamed to have Alex as a daughter. In revenge, Alex goes to sleep with Danny but when reaching his office discovers him having sex with someone else. Gene suspects that George's father, David Bonds, is the actual bomber and brings him in for questioning. George confesses to protect his father. As George is being booked, Hunt pulls out a plastic bag and tosses it to Mrs Bonds and Mr. Bonds ducks under a desk thinking it to contain dynamite. Mr. Bonds was the actual bomber (having previously been an explosive expert serving in North Africa during the Second World War). At Danny's party to celebrate the wedding, however, Alex notices Bonds' son acting suspiciously. Alex and Gene shout to everyone to run and Bonds shouts \"we are all prostitutes\", a reference to his favorite song by The Pop Group, before blowing himself up. Caroline comes to apologise to Alex for misjudging George's character and then announces she is going to spend time with her daughter. Alex looks out to see Gene and the rest of the squad mooning her as part of the deal.\nCast.\nMain\nGuests\nMusic.\nMusic featured in the episode includes:\n\"Swords of a Thousand Men\" – Tenpole Tudor\n\"The Prince\" – Madness\n\"Body Talk\" – Imagination\n\"Money (That's What I Want)\" – The Flying Lizards\n\"Planet Earth\" – Duran Duran\nHappy Birthday – Altered Images\n\"Fade to Grey\" – Visage – Steve Strange appears in this episode playing himself performing the number on stage at The Blitz\n\"Souvenir\" – Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark\n\"We Are All Prostitutes\" – The Pop Group\n\"(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang\" – Heaven 17\n\"I Hear You Now\" – Jon and Vangelis\n\"Geno\" – Dexys Midnight Runners\n\"Gertcha\" – Chas &amp; Dave\nReferences.\nDVD – Ashes To Ashes Series 1, 2008, Kudos"

        "title": "George Armstrong Custer Equestrian Monument",
        "text": "The George Armstrong Custer Equestrian Monument, also known as Sighting the Enemy, is an equestrian statue of General George Armstrong Custer located in Monroe, Michigan. The statue, sculpted by Edward Clark Potter, was designated as a Michigan Historic Site on June 15, 1992 and soon after listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 9, 1994.\nBackground.\nWhile Custer was not born in Monroe, he lived much of his early childhood there with relatives and attended the schools in Monroe. During his youth, he met his future wife Elizabeth Bacon, whom he returned to marry in 1864. Custer left Monroe to attend the United States Military Academy and fight in the Civil War. Because of his hard work and success during the war—as well as the Union's need for officers—he was promoted to the rank of major general and became a very well-known military figure. After the Civil War, he fought in the Indian Wars in the West. His previous accomplishments in the Civil War, however, were overshadowed by his catastrophic defeat and death at the Battle of the Little Big Horn on June 25, 1876.\nTo honor him, a $24,000, 14-foot (4.27 m) bronze equestrian statue, sculpted by Edward Clark Potter, was unveiled in Monroe in June 1910 by President William Howard Taft and the widowed Elizabeth Bacon Custer. The statue commemorates his successful actions during the Civil War and not his more well-known defeat in 1876.\nLocation.\nIn the century since the statue was installed, it has been placed at three different sites. It was originally located in the middle of the brick-paved intersection of First and Washington streets in front of the ; this area is part of the present-day Old Village Historic District. His widow Elizabeth Custer, who spent much of her later life improving Custer's reputation and public image, argued that the statue deserved a better location. Some residents complained that it was a traffic hazard in the middle of an intersection. When the statue was first erected, traffic was sparse in Monroe, but automobile traffic was markedly increasing. On June 20, 1923, the statue was moved to a new location in Soldiers and Sailors Park along the River Raisin. There, the statue stood in relative isolation and was eventually obscured by unkempt scrubs and trees.\nBecause of public protests, the city moved the statue to a better location in August 1955. When movers arrived to take the statue to a new location, they originally could not find it within the overgrown vegetation. The statue was moved to its current location on the southwest corner of Elm Avenue and North Monroe Street along the River Raisin. This is one of the most prominent intersections in the city, and the statue is well-lit at night. The statue is now one of the most recognizable objects in Monroe. The George Armstrong Custer Equestrian Monument is located across Elm Street from the St. Mary's Church Complex Historic District and adjacent to the East Elm-North Macomb Street Historic District.\nMonument.\nProponents of the statue argue that it commemorates Custer's spectacular service to the Union during the Civil War and not his failure at the Battle of the Little Big Horn. The statue shows Custer wearing his Civil War uniform. In keeping with sculptural convention, his horse has all four feet on the ground, as Custer did not die during that period of service. The historical marker commemorating the statue reads:\nBorn in New Rumley, Ohio, George A. Custer grew up in Monroe in the home of his half-sister, Mrs. David Reed. On February 9, 1864, in the Presbyterian Church here, he married Libbie Bacon, the only daughter of Judge and Mrs. Daniel S. Bacon. During the Civil War, Custer served with distinction, including at the Battle of Gettysburg. He received six brevets and was made brigadier-general before he was 26 years old, a rare distinction. From 1866 until his death at the Battle of the Little Big Horn, Custer commanded the famous Seventh Cavalry Regiment, leading them in scouting and Indian fighting throughout Kansas and the Dakota Territory. His rank at death was lieutenant colonel, as he reverted to colonel from brigadier general at the end of the Civil War. (He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1866, at Ft Riley, Kansas.) This statue of General Custer, created by Edward C. Potter, was erected by the State of Michigan, unveiled by Mrs. Elizabeth B. Custer and dedicated by President William Howard Taft on June 4, 1910. The statue was rededicated September 3, 1955, by the members of the First Cavalry Division, of which Custer's Seventh Cavalry Regiment was a part."

The game was released on March 2, 2010.\nUpdates.\nNew to the series is the \"My Player\" feature, a career mode in which the player shepherds a player's career from the minors to the majors. Other features from the previous game have been improved or tweaked, including hitting and pitching. The game also features \"MLB Today\", an online ticker that tracks real-life Major League Baseball news and scores. With the MLB Today feature you can also play the same game that is being played in the real MLB. For example, if the New York Yankees are playing the Boston Red Sox and CC Sabathia is pitching, in the game he will be pitching along with the same lineup that is being used.\nThe commentary has been improved as well, which analyze stats from the current year, the previous year, the previous series, and so forth. The crowd noise has also been reworked and sounds better than any previous version.\nThe Franchise Mode has been enhanced as well. Players can choose multiple teams and run their franchise, and can make staff personnel decisions. There are now 40 man rosters for Spring Training and September call ups. Players also have a minor league system that run from Single A through Triple A. Players can draft players from the high school, college, and amateur league level. Teams now receive compensatory draft picks from Type A and B free agents as well. Players can invite friends to play against them within the Franchise Mode, as well as online player updates.\nLike \"NBA 2K10\", \"Major League Baseball 2K10\" celebrates its 10th anniversary, going back to its Sega Dreamcast origins as \"World Series Baseball\", though the series began in 1994 with the Sega Genesis release of World Series Baseball.\nCommentators.\nThe commentary is delivered by Steve Phillips, Gary Thorne, and John Kruk. For the Wii version, Kruk is not in the commentary booth.\nCover athlete.\nTampa Bay Rays third baseman and Gold Glove Award winner Evan Longoria was announced as the cover athlete for \"2K10\", replacing two-time NL Cy Young Award winner Tim Lincecum from \"MLB 2K9\".\nReception.\n\"MLB 2K10\" received mixed to positive reviews. \"GameZone\"'s Michael Lafferty gave the game a 7/10, saying \"In the past, the 2K series was hampered by a lot of little things. The developers obviously put a lot of time in improving the overall gameplay and it shows. The new modes are fun but need some attention to iron out bugs, and there are some areas where the errors are just downright contrary to the game of baseball. On the surface, baseball seems a simple game, but to the baseball fan, the layers of complexity are what create that overall feeling that is Major League Baseball.\"\nPromotion.\nIn early February, game publisher 2K Sports announced a contest where players had a chance to win $1,000,000 for pitching a perfect game on the Xbox 360 or PS3 versions of the game.\nThe feat was finally achieved by Wade McGilberry of Mobile, Alabama who used the Atlanta Braves pitcher Kenshin Kawakami."

The Washington Huskies of the Pacific-10 Conference shut out the Iowa Hawkeyes of the Big Ten Conference, 28–0, the first in the Rose Bowl in 29 years.\nFreshman running back Jacque Robinson gained 142 yards on 20 carries and set up or scored three of the Huskies' four touchdowns. A non-starter, he had entered the game in the second quarter and did not play in the third; he was the first freshman named Player of the Game. Washington quarterback Steve Pelluer was 15 for 29 passing, end Paul Skansi had four big catches, and linebacker Mark Jerue made thirteen tackles.\nWashington Huskies.\nThe defending Pac-10 champion, Washington began the season ranked fifteenth. After winning their first three games to rise to #12, they were knocked off by Arizona State in Seattle, 26–7. They won their next four games, heading into crucial matchups with UCLA and USC. UCLA shut out the Huskies 31–0 in Los Angeles but Washington shut down USC and Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Allen 13–3 in Seattle. Washington then claimed the Pac-10 title by beating rival Washington State 23–10, while USC knocked UCLA out of first place with a 22–21 win in which they blocked a Bruins' last second field goal attempt.\nIowa Hawkeyes.\nIowa started the season by upsetting #7 Nebraska, losing to Iowa State, then upsetting #6 UCLA. The Hawkeyes took over first place in the Big Ten with a 9–7 win over Michigan in Ann Arbor, but fell to third place behind Ohio State and Michigan with back to back losses to Minnesota and Illinois. They rose back into a tie for second place when Minnesota upset Ohio State. When Ohio State beat Michigan 14–9 in Ann Arbor, that knocked the Wolverines out of first, and left Iowa and Ohio State tied atop the Big 10 standings. Because they did not play each other, Iowa was awarded the Rose Bowl berth since Ohio State had been to the Rose Bowl more recently (1980; the Hawkeyes' most recent trip was in 1959).\nWith an 8–3 regular season, it was Iowa's first winning record in twenty years. They were the first team other than either Michigan or Ohio State to represent the Big Ten in the Rose Bowl in fourteen years, since Indiana in January 1968."

Stages 12 and 13 were flat and did not change the overall standings, but stages 14, 15, 19, and 20 all contained many high climbs.\nIt was after stage 15 that Alberto Contador first took the overall lead that he would eventually hold through the completion of the Giro, finishing fifteen minutes ahead of Gabriele Bosisio, who had won the pink jersey from Visconti the day before. Through the final mountain stages and two individual time trials, Contador held off the challenges of defending champion Danilo Di Luca and eventual runner-up Riccardo Riccò.\nEmanuele Sella of the team won three stages in the Giro's final week, as well as the overall victory in the mountains classification. He would later test positive for and confess to the use of performance-enhancing drugs, casting extreme doubt on the legitimacy of these performances.\nStage 12.\n22 May 2008 — Forlì to Carpi, \nThis stage was flat, and was designed to end in a mass sprint finish. The final occurred on a popular Italian marathon course, with the stage dedicated to Italian marathoner Dorando Pietri.\nDionisio Galparsoro of broke away from the peloton immediately after the true start of the stage. As rain began to fall on what had previously been a sunny day, no one joined the Basque in his escape, and for much of the stage, the peloton let his advantage balloon. His maximum time gap, fourteen minutes, gradually fell to nothing as the rain intensified as the stage went on. A crash with to go thinned the field somewhat, but it was no hindrance to the peloton catching Galparsoro and a sprint finish occurring. Points classification leader Daniele Bennati started the sprint first, making his attack before the race's final left-hand turn. 's Mark Cavendish reacted to Bennati's quick acceleration once around that turn and almost overtook him in the final meters, but the photo finish resulted in a third stage victory for Bennati in this Giro.\nStage 13.\n23 May 2008 — Modena to Cittadella, \nThis stage was as flat as any could conceivably get. It ended with a circuit around the walled city of Cittadella, a medieval military outpost guarding Padua.\nIt took several tries for a breakaway to successfully come clear of the peloton in this stage. The leader of the \"Trofeo Fuga Cervelo\" (the award giving points for kilometers spent in a breakaway) Mickaël Buffaz finally got away after and nearly an hour spent riding. Josu Agirre and Paolo Bettini followed him, though Bettini quickly dropped back to the peloton. Buffaz and Agiree took a maximum lead of 8'24\", at the mark, but the stage's incredibly flat profile meant any breakaway was exceedingly unlikely to survive to the finish line. At the to go mark, the peloton was all together again. and led the field in through the stage's final , much as they had in previous sprint stages. Daniele Bennati again started the sprint early, as he had the previous day, but this time Mark Cavendish had enough road to easily overtake him for the victory. The victory came two days after Cavendish's twenty-third birthday.\nThe day unexpectedly caused a minor change to the overall standings. An extremely fast leadout, coupled with a crash with remaining meant only 48 riders had the same time as the stage winner. The rest of the main field, another 108 riders, were 13 seconds back. Andreas Klöden, Danilo Di Luca, Vincenzo Nibali, and Gilberto Simoni were able to make the selection and gained a little time over their competitors.\nStage 14.\n24 May 2008 — Verona to Alpe di Pampeago, \nThis was the Giro's first stage classified as a mountain stage, though several of those previous had contained selective climbs. The first half of the stage contained three uncategorized rises in elevation, including one to . In the stage's final , there were two categorized climbs, the first-category Passo Manghen, featuring gradients of up to 15%, and a second-category summit stage finish at Alpe di Pampeago. The same climb featured in the 2003 Giro d'Italia, where the stage winner was eventual Giro winner Gilberto Simoni. Simoni had said before the stage that he would again try for victory on this climb.\nThe day's breakaway was large, comprising 13 riders from 11 teams. The only team with more than one rider in the group was , who had three - Joaquim Rodríguez, José Rujano, and Francisco Pérez. Other notables in the group included Christian Vande Velde, Emanuele Sella, Paolo Bettini, and Jens Voigt. The group's maximum advantage, for the time when they were all together, was 7'40\", after . When Sella attacked out of this group to try for maximum mountains points on the Passo Manghen, it was totally shattered, sending some riders, including Vande Velde, back to the peloton and gapping others on the road.\nAt the top of the Passo Manghen, the following groups had formed: Sella alone in front, followed at 2'42\" by Vasil Kiryienka and Rodríguez, then Jure Golčer at 3'00\", Rujano at 3'40\", Bettini, Voigt, Rinaldo Nocentini, and Charly Wegelius at 5'28\", with a group of overall favorites including Alberto Contador, Riccardo Riccò, Gilberto Simoni, and Franco Pellizotti at 10'57\", and race leader Giovanni Visconti and his team a further two minutes back. Simoni's team was the one pacing the group of favorites, indicating that Simoni may have been intending to make good on his pre-stage promises to try for the win again.\nThe groups simplified on the Pampeago climb, with Sella still well ahead out front. from the top, the first on the road 2'24\" behind him were Kiryienka, Rodríguez, Rujano, and Bettini, who had consolidated into one group while Golčer, Nocentini, and Wegelius were dropped. The group of overall favorites was ten minutes back, and Visconti was eighteen minutes back, meaning his pink jersey was in jeopardy. Sella rode most of the rest of the climb out of the saddle, continuously adding to his advantage, which was four and a half minutes over Kiryienka in second on the stage. The four chasers behind him did not remain as a cohesive group; Kiryienka and Rodríguez came ahead of Rujano and Bettini, with Kiryienka attacking in the final kilometer to gain 30 seconds over Rodríguez. Bettini scarcely stayed ahead of the fast-charging group of overall favorites, finishing 49 seconds ahead of Denis Menchov, who led that group home. After the stage, Simoni criticized a perceived lack of combativeness in the riders who had been in the same group as him, calling them \"a bunch of lambs.\"\nAs was expected, the stage greatly changed the overall classification, with 's Gabriele Bosisio becoming the new race leader by a margin of five seconds over Contador. Contador had been unable to respond to attacks made by Menchov, Pellizotti, Riccò, and Simoni in the final kilometer, conceding some 45 seconds to them, but he was still the highest placed rider from that group in the overall standings at the end of the day.\nStage 15.\n25 May 2008 — Arabba to Passo Fedaia, \nThis stage was one of the most climbing-intensive in the race, featuring six categorized climbs. These included three second category climbs, two in the third category, and a never before used uphill finish at Passo Fedaia, a first category climb.\nA flurry of attacks and counter-attacks on the slopes of the day's first climb, the second category Passo Pordoi, reached after just spent racing, resulted in a nine-man leading group forming. The first attacker was Joaquim Rodríguez, who drew mountains classification leader Emanuele Sella with him. Their leading group also included Félix Cárdenas, Jens Voigt, Vladimir Miholjević, Evgeni Petrov, Vladimir Karpets, Fortunato Baliani, and Paolo Bettini. Through the second category Passo San Peligrino and the third category San Tomaso Agordino, the group's advantage hovered at around two minutes, as Sella, Bettini, Rodríguez, and Karpets all potentially posed threats to the GC should the group get a large advantage.\nOn the Passo de Giau, the course's third and final second category climb, the leading group splintered. Rodríguez, Baliani, and Sella came clear, and the other six members of the initial breakaway were absorbed by a chase group composed partly of overall contenders Alberto Contador, Danilo Di Luca, Franco Pellizotti, and Gilberto Simoni. Notably missing from this group was overnight race leader Gabriele Bosisio, who would finish the day eighteen minutes behind the stage winner and lose the pink jersey. Contador was briefly gapped on the climb, but he and Jurgen Van den Broeck caught up to the 15 others in the leading group after the summit, approximately three minutes behind the three leaders.\nVincenzo Nibali and Julio Alberto Pérez came out of this group and after a lengthy chase bridged to the leaders. This gave three riders in the leading group, and Baliani and Pérez worked to get Sella to the top of the Passo Falzarego first for maximum mountains points and a leading gap. Sella stayed away for the stage win, while the group of favorites caught his two teammates and Nibali, and stayed between two and three minutes behind him for the remainder of the stage. In the steep final kilometer before the summit of the Passo Fedaia, Riccardo Riccò put in an attack that Di Luca, Contador, and Denis Menchov were unable to answer, gaining him time on his competition. Contador, however, took the pink jersey, by a margin of 33 seconds over Riccò.\nStage 16.\n26 May 2008 — San Vigilio di Marebbe to Plan de Corones, (individual time trial) \nThis race against the clock was all uphill. It consisted entirely of the first category climb to Plan de Corones. Race organizers had tried to include this climb in 2006, but had to cut it short to a pass on lower elevation because of snow at the summit. The final were on a gravel road, and the last few hundred meters featured a grueling maximum gradient of 24%.\nA strict 25% time cut was enforced on this stage, meaning that the less skilled climbers and time trialists needed to put in strong efforts just to be eligible to remain in the Giro. The first man to take the course, Markus Eichler, posted a time of 49' 58\". This would more than likely survive any time cut, but the second, Thomas Fothen, did not stop the clock until 53' 48\" had ticked by. This was the slowest time of the day and put Fothen, along with five others, outside the time limit, leading to their disqualification from the race.\nThe first competitive time was posted by rider Julio Alberto Pérez, who finished the course in 43' 22\". The riders were staggered into three groups, and Pérez's time stood as best through the first two, after riders such as David Millar, Philip Deignan, and Vladimir Gusev came close but did not best it. The second rider of the third and final group was José Rujano, who posted a time of 41' 15\", which easily beat the times that came before and held up for sixth at day's end. Emanuele Sella was the first rider to beat Rujano, as the top riders in the overall classification took to the course. Sella's time was 40' 32\"; only Franco Pellizotti, at 40' 26\", could beat him. For his stage win, Pellizotti was awarded a distinctive crown on the podium, as \"King of Corones.\"\nThe remaining highly placed riders in the overall classification rounded out the top ten on the day, with race leader Alberto Contador gaining 8 seconds on Riccardo Riccò, more than 30 seconds on Marzio Bruseghin, and more than a minute on Danilo Di Luca and Denis Menchov, after they faltered on the unpaved section of the course.\nStage 17.\n28 May 2008 — Sondrio to Locarno (Switzerland), \nAfter the second rest day, the peloton faced the Giro's shortest road race stage, and the only stage which took the race out of its home country. It was categorized flat, with the third category Passo Monte Ceneri the only recognized climb on the course, coming before the finish in Switzerland.\nA little after the mark of the stage, three riders broke away. These were Francesco Gavazzi, Mikhail Ignatiev, and Yann Huguet. The peloton let them get a big advantage quickly, 8'10\" by the mark. At that point, the chase began in earnest. As the stage was quite short, it was unclear at first whether they would be caught, particularly as time trial specialist Ignatiev proved an effective pace setter for the break. Huguet was dropped on the Passo Monte Ceneri, and the flat section that followed the climb proved to be all the peloton needed to bring Ignatiev and Gavazzi back into the fold. Gavazzi was caught with left to race, while Ignatiev fought on, but was caught with to go. Alberto Ongarato started his sprint with nearly a full kilometer left to race, but he was chased down by Tony Martin, as controlled the race's final kilometers much as they had in previous flat stages. André Greipel was the first around the final turn on the course, from the finish line, but instead of giving way to Mark Cavendish, the big German instead took the stage win himself, which had been Team High Road's plan. Thirteen riders who aggressively sought the stage win finished 4 seconds ahead of the rest of the peloton, but the overall classification was not changed in any significant way by the day's results.\nStage 18.\n29 May 2008 — Mendrisio (Switzerland) to Varese, \nThis stage was also quite short, though it was hilly enough to be categorized medium-mountain. It used much of the same course that was used later in 2008 in the world championships road race. Favorites for the stage win thus included riders believed to be favorites for the world championships, such as two-time defending world champion Paolo Bettini.\nA 12-rider group broke away after spent racing. This group included several notable riders – Bettini, Jens Voigt, points classification leader Daniele Bennati, and former race leaders Gabriele Bosisio and Giovanni Visconti. Voigt, the eventual stage winner, remarked after the stage that he had made it into \"a good group.\" The peloton was uninterested in bringing them back, as none posed overall threats on such a short stage. Their advantage was just over six minutes, at the to go mark, when Voigt broke free of his mates and soloed over the last two laps of the circuit in Varese to reach the finish line. The remainder of the morning's escape finished scattered behind him, with Visconti 1'07\" back and Nikolay Trusov in twelfth 5'19\" back, as the hilly parcours took its toll on some riders. The peloton, led across the line by Lilian Jégou, finished 7'51\" back.\nStage 19.\n30 May 2008 — Legnano to Presolana, \nIt was back to the high mountains for Stage 19, the longest in this Giro. While the first of the course were mostly flat, the final featured three categorized climbs, two second category hills before the first category arrival at Monte Pora in Presolana. This climb had never before been visited in the Giro.\nThe first hour of the stage covered and kept any escape attempts from coming clear. The seven who broke away at that point were Alexander Efimkin, Steven Cummings, Kanstantsin Sivtsov, Gabriele Missaglia, Nicki Sørensen, Giairo Ermeti, and Vasil Kiryienka. An advantage that was at first hard-fought ballooned to 21 minutes at the mark. Rain began to fall as the breakaway started up the Passo del Vivione, still with an advantage of nearly 20 minutes. A selective chase group of some 40 riders formed when the peloton hit the climb.\nAt this point, Danilo Di Luca and teammate Paolo Savoldelli attacked from the group of 40 and managed to come clear, keeping an advantage of close to two minutes through the conclusion of the stage. As Di Luca began the stage 2'18\" behind race leader Alberto Contador, the Spaniard's pink jersey was in jeopardy, and Di Luca was at times the \"virtual\" race leader, when he held an advantage of more than 2'18\" over Contador's group. With left, Contador himself launched an attack, but he was unable to get away. Riccardo Riccò counter-attacked when Contador was brought back, and nearly put enough time into him to take the pink jersey.\nIn the leading group, Kiryienka attacked his six breakaway companions at the foot of the Monte Para climb and soloed to the finish for the win, by a margin of over four minutes. Di Luca passed the other remaining breakaway riders and took second on the stage. Di Luca finished 1'45\" ahead of Contador's group and Riccò crossed the line 37 seconds before them, meaning the top three were again very tightly bunched.\nStage 20.\n31 May 2008 — Rovetta to Tirano, \nThis stage offered one last visit to the high mountains for the 2008 Giro. While it was the only classified mountain stage not to end on a climb, the categorization as a high mountain stage came about because it featured the highest point reached in the Giro and its steepest climb, respectively the Passo di Gavia and the Passo del Mortirolo. The visit to the Passo di Gavia marked twenty years since it was famously conquered by Andrew Hampsten in a driving blizzard en route to his overall victory in the 1988 Giro d'Italia.\nFor over two hours, no one so much as attempted a breakaway on this stage. Gabriele Bosisio was the first rider to come clear, at the mark, but , unwilling to let him potentially help teammate Danilo Di Luca, kept his advantage at under 30 seconds before he was eventually caught. Finally, after had already been covered, eight riders established leading groups. Three, Julio Alberto Pérez, José Rujano, and Evgeni Petrov were in the lead with the other five, Alessandro Spezialetti, Antonio Colom, Félix Cárdenas, Fortunato Baliani, and Charly Wegelius, behind them chasing. They did not stay as two cohesive groups for very long, and they climbed the Passo di Gavia in pairs or alone. Pérez was the first to its summit, claiming maximum points for conquering the \"Cima Coppi\".\nAs the ascent to the Passo del Mortirolo began, three groups had formed. Pérez, Baliani, and Colom were in the lead, as the latter two had caught Pérez shortly after he crested the Passo di Gavia. Trailing by 3'35\" were Petrov, Cárdenas, Wegelius and Rujano, with a group of overall favorites and support riders from their teams at 5'20\". A short while into the climb, the favorites caught the group of five. Pérez was unable to stay with either the leaders for long on the Mortirolo, and he would be dropped by the pink jersey group as well, eventually finishing the stage eleven minutes back in the first large group. Baliani was then dropped from the lead, though he was able to stay with the pink jersey group and finished the stage seventh. Eventually Colom was also caught, though he too stayed with the overall favorites to the finish.\nEmanuele Sella and Riccardo Riccò traded attacks and verbal jabs at the head of the group of favorites as they began the Mortirolo climb. This dropped a few riders from the pink jersey group, but most of the overall favorites remained. The notable exception was Danilo Di Luca, who lost nearly four minutes on the stage and any chance to repeat as Giro champion. Sella and Gilberto Simoni got a gap on the remaining overall favorites, with Sella safely away for the stage win in Tirano. Riccò narrowly missed the time bonus for third on the stage, which would have given him the pink jersey. He and race leader Alberto Contador entered the final stage individual time trial by only 4 seconds, but with Contador recognized as the far superior rider against the clock, the Giro was all but won by the Spaniard at this point.\nStage 21.\n1 June 2008 — Milan, (individual time trial) \nThe final stage of the 2008 Giro was an individual time trial in Milan. This was the first time since 1992 that the Giro had not concluded with a road race stage. The course was on a slight downhill for its duration and was not technical, featuring only a small number of turns and several long straightaways.\nThough the overall victory was likely decided, as race leader Alberto Contador was seen as a superior time trialist to the second-place man Riccardo Riccò, several lower positions in the classification were up for grabs. Entering the day, Marzio Bruseghin and Franco Pellizotti were separated by only 5 seconds for the last step on the podium. Additionally, Denis Menchov trailed Emanuele Sella by 12 seconds for fifth, and Danilo Di Luca's lead over Jurgen Van den Broeck for seventh was only 8 seconds, all margins which were surmountable in the time trial.\nThe stage was almost won by Mikhail Ignatiev, the second man to start as the second-to-last man in the overnight standings and recognized as a solid time trialist. He finished the course in 32'55\", a time which was only bested Tony Martin and his teammate Marco Pinotti, the stage winner with a time of 32'45\".\nThe overall favorites took the course some time later not to decide the stage, but their own battle for specific placings. Contador, who finished the stage in eleventh, was clearly the strongest of the overall contenders on the day, bettering Riccò at the first time check by 53 seconds, Bruseghin by 33 seconds, and Pellizotti by 28 seconds. This momentarily put Bruseghin and Pellizotti in a tie for third overall. Menchov and Van Den Broeck both comfortably outrode their rivals to claim fifth and seventh overall, respectively. At the second intermediate time check, Pellizotti moved five seconds ahead of Bruseghin, but by the finish, Bruseghin had reclaimed the final podium spot by a margin of just two seconds."

        "text": "The UNC Greensboro Spartans men's basketball team represents the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in NCAA Division I. The school's team currently competes in the Southern Conference.\nHistory.\nThe school, formerly The Women's College of The University of North Carolina, allowed male students beginning 1965-66 and started a men's basketball program the following year. The first coach was an instructor in the Physical Education program, the assistant was an administrator in the Chancellor's office, with some limited experience from the University of Kansas basketball program. Games were scheduled with Belmont Abbey, Elon, Guilford, and a few other small colleges. Players came from already-enrolled students, responding to on-campus ads. No records of results are available. UNC Greensboro formalized their program and entered into a twenty-year period participating as an NCAA Division III member, before moving up to NCAA Division II in 1988, and swiftly ascending to NCAA Division I by 1991.\n1991-1999: Division I Firsts for the Spartans.\nMike Dement served as the architect of the program in its move to Division I. He was the Spartans' head coach from 1991 to 1995, leading them from a team with no conference affiliation to the top of the Big South Conference regular season standings in just four seasons. In his last two seasons at UNCG, Dement's teams went 38–18, including a then school-record 23 wins in 1994–95, along with the Big South Conference's regular season title. That team received votes in the Associated Press and ESPN/USA Today Coaches' polls, a first for the program.\nFollowing the 1994-95 season, Dement left to take over the men's basketball program at SMU and was replaced in Greensboro by Randy Peele. In only the second season in which UNC Greensboro was eligible for Division I postseason competition, the Spartans won the Big South Conference regular season and tournament championship, advancing to the NCAA tournament where they received the 15th seed in the Southeast region. In their first NCAA appearance, they fell in the first round to the Cincinnati Bearcats.\nAfter following up their conference championship season with a 10–20 regular season, however, UNC Greensboro left the Big South in 1997 to join the Southern Conference. The Spartans finished at or near the bottom of their division in both of their first two seasons in the SoCon and, after four years in Greensboro, Peele left the Spartans and took an assistant's job with the Virginia Tech Hokies.\n1999-2005: Fran McCaffery Brings the Spartans Back.\nFran McCaffery hit the ground running in Greensboro, compiling a 15–13 record overall and a 9–7 Southern Conference mark in his first season that was the 18th-most improved record nationally among NCAA Division I teams.\nIn his second season, he guided the Spartans to a 19–12 record and the 2001 SoCon tournament championship. It was the school's second NCAA tournament berth. They received a 16 seed, losing in the first round to overall tournament top seed Stanford.\nThe following year (2001–2002) McCaffery led the Spartans to their first 20-win season since joining the Southern Conference. It marked the first time the program claimed a share of the SoCon North Division title as well. After falling to eventual tournament champion Davidson in the conference tournament semifinals, the Spartans were awarded a berth into the 2002 NIT, where they lost to eventual champion Memphis.\nIn his final year in Greensboro, McCaffery brought the Spartans to the brink of the NCAA Tournament before a SoCon Championship game loss to Chattanooga. He led UNCG to a victory over Davidson in the semifinals, defeating a team that had been 16–0 in conference play. A big part of that success was SoCon Freshman of the Year Kyle Hines. Hines set UNC Greensboro and SoCon records for blocked shots, and also broke several other UNC Greensboro single-game and freshman single-season marks. After the season, McCaffery left UNC Greensboro to take the head men's basketball position at Siena\n2005-2011: Return of Mike Dement.\nIn his first season back at UNC Greensboro, Mike Dement led a young Spartan squad to a 12–19 mark. He had two players earn all-conference status in Ricky Hickman and Kyle Hines, and another earn SoCon All-Freshman honors.\nIn 2006–07, Dement guided the Spartans to a 16–14 mark, including a second-place finish in the Southern Conference's Northern Division. Hines, only a junior, earned Southern Conference Player of the Year and Associated Press All-America Honorable Mention status – both accomplishments were firsts for the UNC Greensboro program. The Spartans were considered by many to be the most dangerous team in that year's SoCon Tournament, but were upended in the final seconds by Furman in the quarterfinal round.\nDespite milestones like the program's first-ever win over an ACC team (Georgia Tech in 2007), and the largest ever home crowd at a UNC Greensboro basketball game (21,124 vs Duke in 2005), Dement's teams saw little success in his return. After several seasons with fewer than 10 victories, Dement eventually resigned in the middle of the 2011-12 season.\nMove to Greensboro Coliseum.\nBeginning with the 2009–10 season, the men's basketball team plays all of their home games in the Greensboro Coliseum. The arena, which holds over 23,000 seats, is configured to hold around 7,500 spectators for most games.\nAs part of the move, the Coliseum remodeled a floor to become a Spartan home floor and also completely renovated a massive locker room space for the team, complete with training room, meeting facilities, coaches offices and a players' lounge.\n2011-2021: Sustained Success Under Wes Miller.\nFollowing the mid-season resignation of Mike Dement in December 2011, Wes Miller was given the reins of the program on an interim basis. At the time, the Spartans had a record of 2-8 and were in the midst of an eleven-game losing streak. Under Miller, the team finished Southern Conference play with a 10-8 record, 13-19 overall, winning first place in the Southern Conference North Division. Miller was named the 2012 Southern Conference Coach of the Year and was hired officially as head coach.\nThe Spartans struggled in Miller's first few years, but he soon brought UNC Greensboro an unprecedented run of success. The Spartans reached 25 wins for three successive seasons between 2016 and 2019, won three Southern Conference championships, reached the NCAA tournament in 2018 and 2021, and recorded the program's first postseason victory in the 2019 NIT. Miller is currently the winningest coach in the program's history.\nPlayers recruited by Wes Miller regularly set new Spartan records. Guard Francis Alonso became UNC Greensboro's all-time leader in made 3-pointers and was a two-time first-team All-SoCon selection (2018, 2019). The Spartans also boasted four consecutive Southern Conference Defensive Players of the Year in forward James L. Dickey III (2018) and guard Isaiah Miller (2019, 2020, 2021). Isaiah Miller would go on to become the most decorated player in program history, being named Southern Conference Player of the Year in both 2020 and 2021, the first player to earn back to back SoCon Player of the Year awards since Stephen Curry at Davidson.\nThe 2018–2019 Spartans enjoyed what was arguably their most successful season under Wes Miller. The team went 29–7, finishing 2nd in the Southern Conference and receiving the #1 overall seed in the NIT tournament where they beat Campbell in the First Round before losing to eventual tournament runners-up Lipscomb.\nOn April 14, 2021, Miller left UNC Greensboro to become the head men's basketball coach at the University of Cincinnati.\n2021-Present: After Wes Miller.\nOn April 19, 2021, UNC Greensboro hired Mike Jones as head men's basketball coach.\nRetired numbers.\nThe Spartans have retired three jersey numbers.\nScott Hartzell #5.\nHartzell was inducted into the UNCG Athletics Hall of Fame in 2006. He led UNCG in three-point field goals, three-point shooting percentage, and free throw shooting percentage all four seasons he played. He graduated in 1996 as the school's all-time leader in points at 1,539 and assists at 552. Though those marks have since been eclipsed, he still holds the UNCG record for career three-point field goal percentage (43.9%).\nIn 1995–96, Hartzell led the Spartans to their first NCAA men's basketball tournament appearance after winning the 1996 Big South Championship. During that memorable run, Hartzell ran his streak of consecutive games with a three-point field goal to 42 straight.\nCourtney Eldridge #23.\nEldridge led the Spartans to the 2001 Southern Conference tournament championship against University of Tennessee at Chattanooga and their second NCAA tournament appearance. \nDuring the 2001–2002 season, he was ranked 9th in the Nation and 1st in the SoCon in steals, 23rd in the nation and 3rd in the conference in assists., leading that team to the 2002 Southern Conference regular season title and earning a bid to the NIT.\nEldridge is the Spartan's all-time career leader in assists (584). \nKyle Hines #42.\nIn the 2006–07 season, Kyle Hines became the first player in UNCG history to receive the Southern Conference Player of the Year honor and to be named to the Associated Press All-America Honorable Mention. He became only the sixth player to score 2,000 points, grab 1,000 rebounds and block 300 shots in his college career, joining the ranks of David Robinson, Alonzo Mourning, Tim Duncan, Pervis Ellison and Derrick Coleman.\nHines is the Spartan's all-time leader in a number of statistical categories, including points (2187), blocks (349), points per game (18.2), and rebounds per game (8.7).\nPostseason.\nNCAA Division I Tournament results.\nThe Spartans have appeared in the NCAA Division I tournament four times. Their combined record is 0–4.\nNIT results.\nThe Spartans have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) three times. Their combined record is 1–3.\nCBI results.\nThe Spartans have appeared in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) twice. Their record is 1–2."

        "title": "2010 Arkansas Razorbacks baseball team",
        "text": "The 2010 Arkansas Razorbacks baseball team represented the University of Arkansas in baseball at the Division I level in the NCAA for the 2010 season. Dave van Horn, a former Razorback player, was the coach in his sixth year at his alma mater. The 2010 club hosted and won the Fayetteville Regional, but fell in the Tempe Super Regional to the top-seeded Arizona State Sun Devils. The team was led by two All-Americans, Brett Eibner and Zack Cox.\nPre-Season.\nThe Razorbacks return several key members of the 2009 Arkansas Razorbacks baseball team that went to the 2009 College World Series. A key returner is Andy Wilkins, who was named the Norman Regional Most Outstanding Player. The first baseman Wilkins brings a team-high .319 average to the table, also chipping in 19 home runs and 58 RBI in 2009. Freshman All-American Zack Cox returns to play third base for the Razorbacks. He hit .266 with 39 RBI and freshman school record 13 home runs. Center fielder Brett Eibner, a native of The Woodlands, Texas, also brings power with 12 long balls and 34 RBI. Eibner also returns as a pitcher, going 5–5 in 17 games with a 5.00 ERA. Senior pitcher Mike Bolsinger returns from the bullpen, bringing a great slider and 2.99 ERA to the Razorbacks.\nCoaches.\n\"Source: Baseball – 2010 Coaches\"\nSchedule.\nFebruary.\nBall State.\nThe Razorbacks began the 2010 campaign on February 19 with a 10–2 victory over the Ball State Cardinals. Hogs starter Mike Bolsinger earned the win, and Andy Wilkins provided two hits, 2 RBI, and a solo home run. Every Razorback starting player recorded at least a base hit in the contest. It was a different story in game two, however, as Ball State took a lead in the first inning and did not relinquish it. Geoffrey Davenport would continue after the shaky start to pitch effectively for four innings, including striking out the side in the fourth. The Razorbacks left twelve runners on base, and committed four defensive errors. Game three was initially delayed fifteen minutes due to rain, but once the game started, Brett Eibner and Drew Smyly pitched well. Designated hitter Monk Kreder, a junior college transfer native to Keller, Texas, collected three hits. Six different Razorbacks scored in the 9–3 victory.\nTroy.\nAndy Wilkins, James McCann, and Brett Eibner all went deep in game one of a three game series against the Troy Trojans. Zack Cox was 2–2 with one RBI and two runs scored as the Razorbacks prevailed 10–1. Wilkins, Eibner, and Cox would hit home runs in game two, as the No. 16 Diamond Hogs took a 10–8 slugfest. Redshirt sophomore Drew Smyly started the game, Jeremy Heatley earned the win, and DJ Baxendale, the Arkansas Gatorade Player of the Year as a high school senior, earned his first career save. The Razorbacks started game three with seven runs in the first two innings, but then the bats fell silent. Troy posted six runs, but the Trojans couldn't complete the comeback and lost 7–6.\nMarch.\n#25 Kansas.\nArkansas hosted the No. 25 Kansas Jayhawks at Baum Stadium on March 2. The Razorback offense exploded, with Jarrod McKinney and Monk Kreder both leaving the yard for the first times in their careers. TJ Forrest began the game for the Hogs, and Geoffrey Davenport earned the win in relief.\n#22 California.\nIn the year previous, the Hogs took two of three home games from Cal. This year, the Razorbacks would travel to Evans Diamond in Berkeley, California for the first time ever to take on the No. 22 California Golden Bears. Game one featured a five-run eighth inning for the Razorbacks, including a three-run home run by James McCann. Mike Bolsinger went seven innings (his longest outing) to earn the win. The subsequent day, Fayetteville-native Tim Carver hit two home runs, the first two of his career. Zack Cox going 3 for 4 with 2 RBI, combined with Carver's power, propelled the Hogs to a 9–5 victory. Game three was not as kind to the visiting Hogs, as three errors and eight men left on base would prove vital in a 6–0 loss. The loss snapped the Razorbacks' seven-game winning streak, the University's longest since 2006.\nSouth Dakota State.\nThe South Dakota State Jackrabbits began the 2010 season on a 27-game road trip, including two games in Fayetteville against the No. 14 Razorbacks. Game one against the Jackrabbits produced a disappointing 3–2 loss for the Razorbacks. The Diamond Hogs loaded the bases with no outs in the final frame, but only pushed across one run. Collin Kuhn stole three bases in the loss. The Razorbacks would exact revenge the following day, scoring twenty one runs. Bo Bigham went 3 for 5 with 4 RBI, with home runs coming from Collin Kuhn and Zack Cox. Seven Razorbacks had 2+ hits, and six posted one or more RBI.\nWisconsin-Milwaukee.\nEntering the series against Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Collin Kuhn had reached base in all twelve games, and leads the team with a .395 batting average. The Razorbacks' 17 team home runs leads the SEC. The Razorbacks used eight runs in the seventh inning to rally past the Panthers. The game featured catcher James McCann hitting a grand slam and Zack Cox's hitting streak extending to thirteen games. Game two belonged to Drew Smyly, as the Little Rock native struck out 11 in seven innings, walked two, and giving up four hits. Offensively, Collin Kuhn and Andy Wilkins both homered in the 7–0 victory. The Razorback offense would produce plenty of drama in game three, turning a two-run deficit in the ninth inning into a tenth inning walk-off home run courtesy Matt Vinson. The Alma, Arkansas native would earn SEC Player of the Week honors for his efforts against Wisconsin–Milwaukee, the alma mater of legendary Razorback baseball coach Norm DeBriyn.\n#2 Louisiana State.\nThe highly anticipated series began March 19 at Alex Box Stadium. It was carried on Cox Sports Television. Arkansas took game one, 6–3, behind Brett Eibner's two home runs and a strong seven inning pitching performance from Mike Bolsinger. In game two, Arkansas gave up a four-run lead in the seventh inning to lose 7–8. Collin Kuhn had four RBI and a home run, and Zack Cox also left the yard. Game three went to the Bengal Tigers by a 5–1 final, with Eibner's solo shot providing the only run for the Hogs.\nMcNeese State.\nArkansas' road trip through Louisiana continued to Lake Charles, where the Hogs took on McNeese State University. TJ Forrest, a Louisiana native and LSU transfer, picked up the win in relief. Monk Kreder's RBI single in the sixth inning would prove the game winner, as the Razorbacks took a 3–2 win. Game two also went to the Razorbacks, by a score of 7–6. Matt Reynolds hit his first home run as a Razorback, and Zack Cox extended his hitting streak to 20 games. Razorback pitchers struck out fourteen Cowboys in the contest.\n#16 Alabama.\nThe Razorbacks, ranked as high as 15, took on the No. 16 Alabama Crimson Tide in Baum Stadium for their SEC home opener. Arkansas scored four runs in the eighth inning of game one, leading to a 9–8 victory. Game two also ended in a Razorback comeback. The Hogs, down 3–0 in the seventh inning, got a big hit from pinch hitter Thomas Hauskey. The senior catcher stepped to the plate with a runner on second base and two outs in the bottom of the ninth, and delivered a clutch RBI single to win the game. Collin Kuhn, Zack Cox, Andy Wilkins and Brett Eibner each hit home runs in game three to give the Hogs a 10–5 win. The sweep was the first of Alabama since 2006.\nCentenary.\nArkansas mauled Centenary in game one, scoring thirteen runs in the fourth and fifth innings on the way to an 18–2 win. Bo Bigham and Matt Vinson both recorded three hits apiece, with Andy Wilkins recording 4 RBI and Kyle Robinson chipping in three more RBI. Centenary led by as many as four runs in game two, but Wilkins, James McCann and Bigham each hit RBI doubles in the sixth inning to take control. The win gives Arkansas another seven-game winning streak to close out March.\nApril.\nEntering April, Arkansas is led at the plate by Zack Cox, who is hitting at a .414 clip. Andy Wilkins leads in home runs with 10, followed by Brett Eibner with 7. Wilkins also leads in RBI with 34, and total bases with 69. Drew Smyly leads the starters with a 1.69 earned run average (ERA) over innings. Dual threat Eibner is second with a 2.28 ERA. Arkansas' 3.24 team ERA is the second-best in the SEC (behind Vanderbilt).\n#18 Kentucky.\nThe No. 18 Kentucky Wildcats baseball team came to Baum Stadium for a three game series, starting April 2. In game one, Braden Kapteyn of Kentucky hit a two-run home run in the first inning, and the Wildcats went on to win 12–8. Mike Bolsinger lasted only innings, and the Hogs' seven-game winning streak came to an end. Arkansas would collect seventeen hits in game two, with Drew Smyly pitching seven innings of one-run baseball, as the Razorbacks won 10–1. Collin Kuhn, Zack Cox, Brett Eibner, Tim Carver and James McCann all had multiple hits in game two. Andy Wilkins would leave the game due to a hamstring injury. Game three, played on Easter Sunday, began with the Wildcats jumping out to five-run lead to start the game. In the bottom of the second, Razorbacks catcher James McCann powered a three-run homer over the fence, and coupled with some Kentucky miscues, the Razorbacks took an 8–5 lead. The UK offense would strike again for seven runs in the seventh off of Razorback reliever DJ Baxendale to make it 16–13 Wildcat lead. In the ninth, Jarrod McKinney drew a walk, followed by a McCann single and Andy Wilkins pinch-hit walk. Collin Kuhn was due up, and with two outs and two strikes, Kuhn took the pitch from Matt Little over the left field fence for a walk-off grand slam. The 17–16 final capped a very offensive weekend for the Hogs, including 35 runs and 48 hits.\nSaint Louis.\nArkansas scored fourteen runs, a school record, in the first inning, and won easily, 32–8, in seven innings. The Razorbacks first twelve batters reached base before the Billikens recorded an out. Collin Kuhn, Kyle Atkins, Bo Bigham, Zack Cox, Derrick Bleeker, Matt Vinson, Monk Kreder, Travis Sample, Tim Carver, Kyle Robinson, and Tom Hauskey all had multiple hits for the Razorbacks, with home runs from Kuhn, Bigham, Brett Eibner, and Vinson.\nMississippi State.\nArkansas earned its first ever road sweep in Starkville when they took all three games from Mississippi State.

In game one, televised by ESPN2, Drew Smyly limited the Bulldogs to five hits with seven strikeouts and no walks as he went the distance. He got ten runs of support from the Razorback offense, led by an Andy Wilkins home run in the first inning and Bo Bigham, who reached base five times. Game two was another 10–2 win for the Razorbacks behind a strong seven-inning outing by Brett Eibner. The junior from Houston also had four RBI to help his cause. Collin Kuhn went 4 for 5 at the plate, falling a home run short of the cycle. The Razorback offense continued to excel in game three.

After receiving criticism from horseplayers, Chaney famously stated that he knew nothing about handicapping. From Bloodhorse.com criticism that the incident changed the race by eliminating the pace rival Moreno, Chaney said, \"Did it change the outcome? Any interference could.

        "title": "2009–10 Temple Owls men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2009–10 Temple Owls men's basketball team represented Temple University in the 2009–10 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. They were led by head coach Fran Dunphy and played their home games at the Liacouras Center. The Owls are members of the Atlantic 10 Conference. They finished the season 29–6, 14–2 in A-10 play to claim a share of the regular season championship. They won the 2010 Atlantic 10 men's basketball tournament for the third consecutive year to receive the conferences automatic bid to the 2010 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. They received a 5 seed in the East Region where they were upset in the first round by 12 seed Cornell.\nPreseason.\nThe team is set to play their home games at Liacouras Center, which has a capacity of 10,206. They are in their 28th season as a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference. Coming back from their 2008–09 season, they compiled a record of 22–12 and won the Atlantic 10 men's basketball tournament for the second consecutive year.\nHowever, Temple lost star player Dionte Christmas to graduation, whom Blue Ribbon Yearbook said that, if \"anything good that happened to the Owls last year, Christmas had a hand in it.\" He led Temple in three statistics: points per game (19.5), three-pointers completed (107), and total steals (51); he finished second in two more: rebounds per game (5.5) and assists (28). In addition, he was an honorable mention All-American and scored 2,000 points over his college basketball career. Also graduating were two other starters: 7–0 center Sergio Olmos, who was selected as an All-A10 Tournament player, and point guard Semaj Inge.\nTemple's schedule was announced on September 3, 2009, consisting of a school record-tying 31 games in the regular season. The out-of-conference portion, adopted on July 21, was regarded as one of the toughest in college hoops. The highlights of it include: Georgetown and Siena, which began the season ranked; Virginia Tech, a competitor in the Atlantic Coast Conference; Penn State, who won the 2009 National Invitation Tournament; and Villanova and Kansas, two top 10 teams.\nDue to these factors, Temple was picked to finish fifth in the conference by the Atlantic 10 Preseason Poll, tied with Duquesne. Lavoy Allen was the only team member selected on the Preseason All-Atlantic 10 First Team. The Blue Ribbon Yearbook gave the backcourt a grade of B, the frontcourt a B, the bench/depth a C+, and the intangibles a B+. They commented that \"the Owls have had a way the last couple years of surprising people,\" and that while Temple \"might still surprise some people, but don't expect it to be with an NCAA Tournament berth.\"\nSeason.\nPreconference season.\nThe Owls kicked off their season on November 14, 2009 with a 76–56 win against the University of Delaware, sending the Fighting Blue Hens to their fourth straight loss as a home opener. On November 17, the Owls failed to capitalize on preseason No. 19 Georgetown Hoyas' sloppy play, as the Hoyas were victorious 45–46. The game featured more fouls (18) and turnovers (16) than completed baskets (15) for Georgetown, playing their home opener at the Verizon Center. Georgetown led 19–13 at halftime, but Temple managed to mount a comeback, as they led with 6 seconds left in regulation until Hoya Greg Monroe scored the winning 3-pointer. After the game, Temple's 68-game winning streak when opponents scored less than 50 points was crushed.\nOn November 21, Temple beat the Siena Saints, after overcoming a six-point deficit at the half to end the game at 73–69. As a result, the Owls began receiving votes in the 2008-09 NCAA Division I men's basketball rankings for the week of November 23. After an easy win against Ball State on November 24, the Owls next faced Virginia Tech in the semifinals of the Philly Hoop Group Classic. Temple overcame Malcolm Delaney's 32 points to defeat the Hokies 60–51 on November 27. Their 4–1 start was the Owls' best since 2000.\nThe team suffered their second loss of the season by the undefeated Red Storm of St. John's on November 28, in the championship game of the Philly Hoop Group Classic. Temple led 22–21 at the half, but the Red Storm went on a 14–2 run in the beginning of the second half from which the Owls could not recover, and St. John's won 55–48. This caused Temple to lose all support in the national rankings. The Owls rebounded with three consecutive wins: against Western Michigan, Penn State, and Miami (Ohio). The Penn State game was notable in that it was the second lowest scoring game in the 13-year history of the Liacouras Center. Ryan Brooks's 19 points, the only Owl scoring in double figures, helped lead Temple over the Nittany Lions 45–42 in the largely defensive matchup.\nTemple entered the top 25 in national rankings for the first time since 2001."

        "title": "The Book of Basketball",
        "text": "The Book of Basketball: The NBA According to the Sports Guy is the second book by former ESPN columnist Bill Simmons. Published in 2009, it covers the history of the National Basketball Association (NBA). In 2019, Simmons launched a sequel podcast series, Book of Basketball 2.0, which analyzes the evolution of the league since the book was published.\nBackground.\nAt the time of the book's publishing, Simmons had been writing under the name “The Sports Guy” for 12 years, 9 of them with ESPN, and was receiving 1.4 million page views per month. In 2006, he started developing the idea for \"The Book of Basketball\", spending three years reading over 80 books on basketball and watching 400 game tapes.\nSimmons's goal in the book was to figure out why some players or teams matter more than others. The original premise for the book was to \"blow up the Basketball Hall of Fame and reconstruct it like an Egyptian pyramid.\" As he continued his research, he realized that there was \"no real way to compare players from different eras without a common theme in place.\" Simmons derived an idea that he admitted was not perfect, but helped in finding a fair ranking system for players past and present. He took into account NBA championships, regular season and playoff statistics, as well as longevity and flair. Simmons chose Tom Chambers as the first player in his new Pyramid (96th out of 96) because he saw Chambers as the \"Was Player A better than...?\" example for power forwards, and wanted to establish that baseline to underline the multi-tiered structure of his reimagined, moved-to-Indiana Hall of Fame. \nWhile the book's Hall of Fame-related sections comprise about half the pages used (from 263 to 627, spanning chapters six through 11, in the paperback), the book leads into this by covering several key matters in NBA history. These involve Simmons' recounting of his father (Bill Sr.) purchasing a season ticket for only $4 a game as the Celtics rose and fell and rose (and critically rose when Larry Bird arrived in Boston); a meeting with Simmons' non-fan Isiah Thomas that turned into a surprisingly friendly discussion about \"The Secret of basketball\"; an overview of how Bill Russell was the greatest center of all-time (and NOT Wilt Chamberlain); a history of how the NBA evolved between 1949 and 1984 into what it is today; dozens of what-if scenarios for the NBA (including \"What if the Detroit Pistons had drafted Carmelo Anthony instead of Darko Milicic in 2003?\" and \"What if the 1984 NBA Draft had unfolded differently?\"); and a breakdown of past Most Valuable Player awards that were divided into completely deserving winners (all five trophies won by Michael Jordan), winners who were questionable but ultimately all right (such as Bill Walton's win in 1978) and winners who were travesties of justice (Jordan losing out to Charles Barkley in 1993 and Karl Malone in 1997). Stories are included of \"The first time I witnessed this player live\" moments that Bill recounts from his childhood, as well as anecdotes from his professional career in sports writing.\nIn 2010, Simmons released an updated paperback version of the book, cutting 30 pages from the original, fixing factual errors, adding new material, including fixing footnotes, updating his Hall of Fame Pyramid, and including a virtual guide. This updated version was released on December 7, 2010.\nSynopsis.\nFrom \"The Wall Street Journal\":\nReception.\n\"The Book of Basketball\" debuted at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list and spent 6 weeks in the top 15. It was named to Amazon's \"Best Books of the Month\" for October 2009. \"The Book of Basketball\" has been profiled in \"The Wall Street Journal\", Deadspin, \"Dallas Morning News\", \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\".\nReviews for \"The Book of Basketball\" have been mostly positive, although it has been criticized for its length and editing. The \"Wall Street Journal\" notes that \"Mr. Simmons may not resolve every long-standing hoops debate—who could?—but he compensates with plenty of detail and humor. And he has produced enough provocative arguments to fuel barstool arguments far into the future.\"\nSeveral writers in \"New York\"'s Vulture Blog objected to sexism in the book. Tommy Craggs found Simmons' sexism \"astounding\", citing Simmons' quote: \"Every time I watch Jason Kidd play, initially it's like seeing a girl walk into a bar who's just drop-dead gorgeous, but then when he throws up one of those bricks, it's like the gorgeous girl taking off her jacket and you see she has tiny mosquito bites for tits.\" Ben Mathis-Lilley found Simmons' sexism \"intrusively abhorrent\", stating that \"I actually stopped bothering to copy down the most egregious comments and figured I'd just note when Simmons mentioned a woman for any reason other than evaluating her appeal as something to put a penis in. I'm open to correction on this, but I believe it was when he praised Meryl Streep's acting somewhere around page 500.\"\nBook of Basketball 2.0.\nOn October 30, 2019, Simmons announced the sequel, \"Book of Basketball 2.0\", as a podcast which would consist of interviews with players, coaches, and top media members to determine how the league has evolved and where it’s headed."

        "title": "Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 1994",
        "text": "Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 1994 achieved the unprecedented feat of winning three trophies in an English domestic season. The treble included titles in the County Championship, Sunday League and Benson &amp; Hedges Cup while the grand slam was narrowly missed as they lost to Worcestershire in the final of the Natwest Trophy. \"Wisden\" described it as the 'most remarkable season by any side in the history of county cricket'.\nWarwickshire, captained by Dermot Reeve and coached by Bob Woolmer, won the County Championship by 42 points from second placed Leicestershire, the largest winning margin since 1979. During the 17 match season Warwickshire won eleven and lost just once, with the remainder draws. The solitary defeat came at home against Nottinghamshire when they lost by an innings. In one-day competitions they won 21 of their 26 matches.\nThe signing of Brian Lara as overseas player played a key role in the success, arriving days after recording a Test record innings of 375 he began the season with six centuries in seven innings which culminated against Durham County Cricket Club when he scored a first-class record 501 not out. He finished the season with nine centuries and a total of 2,066 runs at an average of 89.82, topping both run scoring and average lists for the season. His one-day performances paled in comparison, he scored 634 runs at 28.81 with a best of 81.\nBackground.\nIn the 1993 season Warwickshire finished the County Championship in 16th position amongst the 18 counties. Two batsmen, Andy Moles and Dominic Ostler passed 1,000 runs while only Neil Smith, with 44, took more than 30 wickets. In one-day competitions they finished 10th in the National League, were knocked out of the first round of the Benson and Hedges Cup, and won the Natwest Trophy. They beat Sussex by five wickets in the Lord's final, chasing down 322 with Asif Din scoring a century and Dermot Reeve finishing unbeaten on 81.\nThe main pre-season interest surrounded which overseas player the county would sign. South African fast bowler Allan Donald had been at the club since 1987 but with South Africa touring England in 1994, the first time since re-admission, he would be unavailable for much of the season. The initial target was Indian all-rounder Manoj Prabhakar but he failed a fitness test on 6 April because of an ankle injury. The second choice was West Indian batsman Brian Lara and he signed a contract just two days later. Lara was playing in the Caribbean against England at the time and during the fifth Test of the series he scored 375, breaking the Test record for highest individual score.\nThe other significant signing in the close season was left arm spinner Richard Davis from Kent. Despite the acquisitions the club were not expected to mount a Championship challenge and were 25/1 to win the title. Warwickshire's coach for the season was Bob Woolmer who had joined the club in 1991 on a three-year contract. England all-rounder Dermot Reeve was captain for a second season.\nCounty Championship.\nResults.\nTest record holder Brian Lara's county debut meant increased media presence for the first game of the season. The crowd was left disappointed on the first day as Glamorgan won the toss and chose to bat. The scoring rate on the first day was slow apart from Bermudian David Hemp who scored a maiden first-class century. In response to Glamorgan's 365 Warwickshire scored a total of 657/7 declared which equalled the county record for highest innings. The total was built on a career-best innings from opener Roger Twose, his score of 277 not out also was the second highest by a Warwickshire player. Twose had endured a poor 1993, scoring 224 runs in 11 matches, and surpassed that season's total in his dogged and determined innings which lasted more than ten hours. He shared a 215-run second wicket partnership with Lara, who scored 147 from 160 balls becoming the seventh Warwickshire player to score a hundred on debut. Needing to bat for longer than a day to draw the match Glamorgan lost two early wickets before the close of the third day. They were bowled out mid-afternoon on the final day with Gladstone Small claiming his first five wicket haul since 1990. Richard Davis, on his county debut, took three wickets.\nRain and bad light allowed only 14 balls to be delivered on the first day with Leicestershire, put in, remaining unscathed. On the second day opener and captain Nigel Briers scored his 27th century and first since his return from rupturing an Achilles tendon. He shared a partnership of 108 in 27 overs with Ben Smith (78). Leicestershire batted onto the third morning with Warwickshire's bowlers being too wayward to exploit the helpful conditions. Brian Lara continued his good form by scoring a third consecutive century but Warwickshire were only able to save the follow-on by one run. Roger Twose, with 51, was the only other player to pass 18 as the hosts collapsed from 201/2 to 254, all eight wickets falling to former Warwickshire spinner Adrian Pierson. On the final day Leicestershire batted on until 35 minutes after lunch before declaring to leave Warwickshire a target of 285 from 57 overs. They survived with three wickets remaining but owed a great deal to Lara who was the only person to pass 20, his score of 120 not out made him the first Warwickshire batsman in 10 years to score hundreds in both innings of a match.\nAfter winning the toss and batting first Somerset closed the first day on 255/5, the highest scorer being opener Mark Lathwell who made 86 in nearly four hours. Following his dismissal captain Andy Hayhurst and wicket-keeper Robert Turner shared a fifth wicket stand of 100 which was ended shortly before the close. Hayhurst completed a slow-paced century on the second day, before afternoon showers led to the hosts’ declaration. The wickets were shared amongst the Warwickshire bowlers but Richard Davis did take five catches, one short of a county fielding record. Warwickshire closed on 57 without loss. The third day witnessed no play because of rain so to generate a result both teams declared early on the final day leaving Warwickshire a fourth innings target of 321 from 95 overs. They were well placed on 87/1 at lunch but rain returned to wash out the afternoon session leaving the visitors 33 overs to score the 234 more needed to win. Brian Lara set about the unlikely chase by sharing partnerships of 74 in 9 overs with Paul Smith and then 126 in 14 overs with Asif Din. Lara reached his century, his fifth in consecutive innings, off 72 balls and was dismissed for 136 off 94. Warwickshire completed the victory with 20 balls remaining.\nThe pre-match interest surrounded Brian Lara and his attempt to equal the first-class record of scoring six centuries in consecutive innings. After rain wiped out the first day Lara soon found himself in the middle as Middlesex chose to field first and Warwickshire lost an early wicket. He made 26 before edging a leg side delivery from Richard Johnson through to the wicket-keeper. The visitors were all out for 211, with no batsman passing fifty. Desmond Haynes was dismissed off the first ball of the reply but Middlesex lost no further wickets in the remainder of the day. Mike Roseberry and Mike Gatting, not out overnight, shared 77 for the second wicket before the latter was dismissed for 52. Roseberry also shared 79 with Mark Ramprakash (37) before going on to complete a 17th first-class century. He was ninth out as the middle and lower order offered little resistance and Middlesex's lead was restricted to 38. The deficit was turned into a lead by the close with Lara scoring a 52-ball half-century. He completed a sixth century in seven innings on the final morning, adding 85 from 84 balls, that quick scoring enabled a declaration leaving Middlesex a target of 269 from 50 overs. They began well, reaching 129/1 before Tim Munton took the wickets of Gatting and Ramprakash in consecutive deliveries followed by Roseberry in his next over. The chase continued but another double strike from Munton left Middlesex to settle for the draw.\nDurham won the toss and on an easy paced pitch chose to bat first. After both openers were dismissed inside the first 75 minutes, number three John Morris shared century partnerships with Stewart Hutton (61) and Phil Bainbridge (67). Morris was dismissed early on the second day but his innings of 204 was the highest by a Durham player at the time, it was also his first century for Durham since moving from Derbyshire. An eighth wicket stand of 134 between Anderson Cummins (62) and David Graveney (65*) boosted the total before a mid-afternoon declaration. The early wicket of Dominic Ostler brought Brian Lara to the crease, dropped on 18 by wicket-keeper Chris Scott at the close Lara was 111 not out and had become the first player to score seven centuries in eight innings. The third day of the match was rained off and with the captains unable to agree on a target, Lara had free rein to bat on. He took the opportunity by scoring 174 runs in the pre-lunch session, in the afternoon he added a further 133 and in the process beat the previous best by a Warwickshire player (305* by Frank Foster) and passed 1,000 runs for the season in only his seventh innings. After tea he passed Archie MacLaren's 424, the highest score in England, and progressed to 497 by the time of the final over. Still two runs short of the first-class record, Lara was made aware it was the last over of the match by batting partner Keith Piper after the fourth ball, the next delivery was driven for four to break the record. Lara's innings took 427 balls and lasted less than eight hours. He broke the records for most boundaries in an innings (72) and most runs in a single day (390). Trevor Penney contributed just 44 to a third wicket partnership of 314 with Lara while the unbeaten fifth wicket partnership between Lara and Piper was worth 322. The team total of 810/4 bettered the county record by over 150 runs.\nHaving won the toss and batted first, Warwickshire pair of Roger Twose and Dominic Ostler (94) put on 196, their largest opening partnership of the season. The stand delayed the appearance of Brian Lara, in his first Championship innings since his record-breaking innings he made a sketchy 19. Contributions down the order took the total past 400 by the time of their dismissal shortly after lunch on the second day. After the early loss of Mark Benson, Kent batted cautiously until Carl Hooper's arrival at 60/2. He batted fluently in reaching a century from 131 balls and shared 109 in 28 overs for the third wicket with David Ward (63). On the third day Richard Davis took a sharp return catch to dismiss Hooper and although Matthew Fleming struck an aggressive 73, Warwickshire were able to gain a first innings lead. The hosts openers put on a second century stand of the match, before 86 runs in 55 minutes on the fourth morning allowed a declaration. The target of 347 off 82 overs on a turning pitch proved too much as Kent's batsmen were unable to go on after making starts. Neil Smith's figures of 7/133 were a career best while fellow spinner Davis took the other three wickets.\nWarwickshire won the toss and built a formidable first day total of 448/9 after Brian Lara scored an eighth century in eleven innings. His score of 197 took 195 balls and contained 30 fours and 3 sixes. The only bowler to contain Lara was Curtly Ambrose who conceded 12 runs from the 45 balls he delivered to him. The second highest score was 39 from Trevor Penney who put on 168 in 31 overs with Lara. The last wicket partnership between Graeme Welch and Tim Munton grew to 68 before the innings was ended. Early in the reply Munton took the wickets of both openers before a 137 run partnership between Allan Lamb and Rob Bailey (54) recovered the situation. Welch, on his Championship debut, took the wickets of Lamb, Bailey and Mal Loye in a 22 ball spell and Northamptonshire lost their last 5 wickets for 27 runs allowing Warwickshire to enforce the follow on. Northamptonshire fared better second time around despite losing their first four wickets by the time the score reached 83. Loye and Kevin Curran (56) repaired the innings so the hosts ended day three with a lead of 84 runs and three wickets remaining. Loye, 99 overnight, reached his century before his seven-hour innings was ended. The resistance was continued by Russell Warren (94) and tail-ender Paul Taylor who took 113 balls for his 26. Needing 228 in 38 overs, Warwickshire won with three balls to spare. Dominic Ostler and Roger Twose (39) shared a fourth consecutive century opening stand while Penney, promoted to number three, added 43.\nLancashire won the toss and chose to bat first. After losing both openers cheaply, John Crawley and Neil Fairbrother (76) put together a third wicket partnership of 164. Crawley's innings took him past 1,000 runs for the season, the third man to pass the landmark in 1994. Lancashire collapsed from a strong position of 274/3 to 342/9 with Welch taking three wickets in 19 balls. Despite missing Brian Lara the match with a knee injury, Warwickshire's top order performed well ending day two on 350/3. Opener Andy Moles scored 87 from 222 balls while Trevor Penney reached a sixth first-class hundred. Jason Radcliffe, making his first appearance of the season, added 69. The hosts collapsed on the third morning losing their last seven wickets for 28 runs, four of those fell to Glen Chapple. The clay pitch was now offering indifferent bounce and after making a good start to their second innings Lancashire themselves collapsed from 100/1 to 194 all out. Neil Smith took 7/42 and bettered his career best figures for the second successive home match. With rain threatening, the target was chased urgently, the last 72 runs being scored in 12 overs. Roger Twose's top score of 90 contained eleven fours and two sixes.\nSurrey chose to bowl first on a green pitch and made use of the conditions to reduce Warwickshire to 52/5. Paul Smith suffered injuries to his hand and elbow but batted on to score 34 in two hours while Graeme Welch and Dougie Brown (54) both scored maiden first-class fifties putting on 110 for the ninth wicket. Alec Stewart and Graham Thorpe (38) added 107 for the second wicket before losing five wickets to the medium pace of Roger Twose in a nine over spell on the first evening. The last four wickets fell inside half an hour on the second morning, Tim Munton took three of those while Twose took the other to finish with career best figures. Opener Andy Moles scored his first century of the season and with contributions from Brian Lara (44) and Twose (31), Warwickshire built a substantial lead by the end of the second day. The best support came from Neil Smith who scored 57 and added 131 with Moles for the sixth wicket. Moles remained unbeaten, his innings breaking the record for the highest at the ground. By the close of the third day Surrey had lost five wickets. The lower order scored quickly on the final morning but could not prevent a heavy defeat. Munton and Neil Smith bowled throughout the final session, Munton took 5/96 to end with match figures of 9/137 and Smith took four wickets.\nWinning the toss, Warwickshire batted aggressively in their first innings. Brian Lara top scored with 70 from 81 balls, which included 11 fours and a six; there were also fifties from Andy Moles and Neil Smith. In the field Nick Knight took five catches, equalling the county record, and affected a run out. Before the close Essex had lost two wickets to Graeme Welch. Essex batted unconvincingly and only saved the follow-on by four runs. Knight scored his first championship half-century for two years and Nasser Hussain added 53 but both were caught by Keith Piper who took seven catches in the innings, a county record. Tim Munton took the last six wickets to fall, five in a twelve over spell after lunch. Moles and Roger Twose shared a century opening stand and Warwickshire closed the second day on 156/3, a lead of 302. Twose was dismissed early on the third day and the last seven wickets added 106 to increase the lead past 400. Opener Knight was the mainstay of Essex's second innings, he scored more than half the total and was last man out for 113. The second highest score was 26 from Jonathan Lewis who added 79 with Knight for the second wicket. Munton dismissed Lewis and Hussain before Dougie Brown was introduced and took four quick wickets, Munton returned to take Knight, his tenth wicket of the match.\nDerbyshire won the toss and on a green pitch bowled first. Brian Lara struck his eighth century of the season including a hundred, off 94 balls, before lunch. He put on 160 for the fourth wicket with Trevor Penney (41) who was the only other batsman to pass 17. Tim Munton took three wickets as Derbyshire closed day one on 165/6. On the second morning Munton took the remaining four wickets in 23 balls to finish with 7/52, his seventh five wicket haul and best figures of the season. Dominic Ostler and Andy Moles (63) added 114 in 29 overs for the third wicket after the fall of Lara for 51 off 45. Derbyshire captain Kim Barnett took the wicket of Moles which sparked a collapse from 190/2, his leg-spin took five wickets while off-spinner Matthew Vandrau claimed three. The second day closed with Derbyshire on 26/1 in pursuit of 342. Munton took two wickets in his opening spell to reduce the hosts to 35/4, from there wickets fell regularly with off-spinner Neil Smith taking 5/69. Wicket-keeper Keith Piper took seven dismissals in the innings, equalling the Warwickshire record for the second match running. He also took 11 dismissals in the match which broke the county record and was one short of the first-class record.\nWorcestershire chose to bowl first on a gloomy first day which saw 62 overs lost to the weather. Warwickshire lost three wickets on the opening day, openers Andy Moles and Roger Twose both scored 39 with Brian Lara making five. On the second day Warwickshire lost their last seven wickets for 87 in 44 overs, Stuart Lampitt was the pick of the bowlers taking three wickets to finish with figures of 4/32. Worcestershire openers Philip Weston and Tim Curtis had both scored unbeaten half-centuries before the close. The pair had shared 208 for the opening partnership when Weston fell six short of a first century of the season, Curtis went on to score 180 in over eight hours of batting. In the post-tea session David Leatherdale (71*) and Lampitt (56*) capitalised on poor bowling to boost the total by 133 in 25 overs. A declaration left Warwickshire with a deficit of 257 and 116 overs to play, in a 14 over spell on the third evening they lost two wickets. Nightwatchman Graeme Welch (66) and Moles (67) put on 135 for the third wicket and with further half-centuries from Trevor Penney and Lara (57) Warwickshire comfortably survived the final day to draw the match.\nWarwickshire won the toss and fielded first on an overcast day and slow pitch. Stand-in captain Tim Munton took an early wicket but Nottinghamshire dominated the first day with Paul Pollard scoring a century in 295 minutes. He shared hundred partnerships with both Graeme Archer (41) and Paul Johnson (63) as the visitors closed a curtailed opening day on 268/4. Chris Lewis dominated the scoring on day two, taking his overnight score of 20 to 220 not out by the time of the declaration. He scored 21 fours and 6 sixes in his innings, and added 157 in 27 overs with Kevin Evans. Warwickshire lost three wickets in the remaining 20 over session. Warwickshire were made to follow on despite lower order resistance from Graeme Welch. He scored a career best 84 not out sharing in an eighth wicket stand of 68 with Neil Smith and added 86 with tail-enders Gladstone Small and Munton. Following on, Brian Lara was dismissed for a duck which brought his season average below 100 for the first time. The hosts closed day three on 134/3 with Roger Twose unbeaten on 74. Twose and overnight partner, Trevor Penney, were both dismissed inside the first 10 overs of the final day to reduce hopes of drawing the match. Three other wickets fell before lunch and Nottinghamshire's victory was achieved 45 minutes after the interval when Munton fell to Lewis, his sixth of the match.\nYorkshire won the toss and batted first on a slow but flat pitch. They had lost five wickets for 175 by mid afternoon but a sixth wicket stand of 94 between Bradley Parker and Peter Hartley (61) boosted the total. Parker's innings was a career best and contained eight fours. Debutant Alex Wharf claimed Brian Lara as his maiden wicket in first-class cricket, to leave Warwickshire on 44/2. Opener Andy Moles (65) and Dominic Ostler put on 191 in 67 overs for the third wicket, building the platform for a significant first innings lead. Twose innings included 21 fours and a six and fell six runs short of a career best score. The visitors closed day two with a lead of 36 and five wickets remaining. Welch scored a third fifty in consecutive matches and aided by contributions from the lower order the lead was increased to 149. Yorkshire began well in response, openers Martyn Moxon and Michael Vaughan (49) put on 93 before the latter was bowled by Richard Davis. Davis took two further wickets in quick succession to reduce them to 109/3. Moxton reached a third century of the season and alongside Richard Blakey put on 92 before play ended. Moxton added 10 to his overnight score but a fluent 77 from Blakey and a spirited 46 by Wharf saw the innings well into the final afternoon. Davis took three further wickets, finishing with his first five wicket haul for the club. The target for Warwickshire was 199 in 49 overs and an opening stand of 89 in 16 overs between Moles (48) and Twose ensured it was a comfortable chase, achieved with eight and a half overs in hand.\nAfter rain delayed the start until 2.30pm, Sussex won the toss and batted first. They made a solid start, reaching 59/1 after 90 minutes of play before Roger Twose in his fourth over took three wickets. Jamie Hall and Peter Moores (29) steadied the innings with a partnership of 42 but the wicket of Hall caused a collapse from 103/4 to 131 all out. Warwickshire lost two wickets in the remaining three overs. With the visitors on 67/5 the match was evenly poised but Dominic Ostler and Trevor Penney (24) put on 67 for the sixth wicket, Ostler was the only player to score a half-century in the match. A ninth wicket stand of 30 between Graeme Welch and Gladstone Small increased the lead past 50, substantial under the circumstances. Sussex lost regular wickets in their second innings and closed day two on 107/8 with top scoring Martin Speight unbeaten on 38. Tim Munton dismissed Speight with the second ball of the third day and shortly afterwards took the final wicket to finish with eight wickets in the match. Requiring 76 to win, openers Andy Moles and Twose saw Warwickshire to victory without loss.\nHampshire chose to bat first on winning the toss; they began slowly before a collapse of five wickets for ten runs in eight overs. The position of 129/1 had been built by Paul Terry who scored 71 and shared stands of 74 and 55 with Tony Middleton (18) and Giles White (30) respectively. They recovered from 139/6 with Shaun Udal adding 64 and Rajesh Maru scoring 32. By the close Hampshire had been dismissed, Tim Munton finishing the innings with his fourth wicket of the day and 500th of his career. Warwickshire dominated a curtailed second day, scoring 210 in three hours of play. Andy Moles was the sole wicket to fall, and that brought together left-handers Roger Twose and Brian Lara who shared an unbeaten second wicket stand of 156 in 28 overs. When play was abandoned Lara had scored 89 from 93 balls and Twose 84 from 121. The partnership was extended to 295, the highest for any Warwickshire wicket against Hampshire. Lara's score was his ninth century for the club and took him past 2,000 runs for the season. Twose's innings of 137 took five hours and contained 19 boundaries. After their dismissals the middle order looked to score quickly but rain again restricted play. Warwickshire closed with a lead of 205 and four wickets remaining. They batted on for 40 minutes into the final morning increasing the lead by 53 runs. Munton dismissed both openers before spinners Neil Smith and Richard Davis took over, taking the remaining eight wickets including a spell of five wickets in five overs. The innings victory secured the County Championship title for Warwickshire, their first since 1972.\nThe fixture was drawn with only one day, the third, of play possible. Gloucestershire won the toss and chose to bat first, Dean Hodgson scored a century having endured a poor season. He added 110 for the second wicket with Matt Windows (63) and there were contributions down the order from Tim Hancock (70) and Martyn Ball (38). Richard Davis bowled a long spell to take his second six wicket haul in four matches. The declaration came 40 minutes before the close and Warwickshire remained unscathed.\nAftermath.\nDespite Warwickshire's success, none of the players were selected for the 1994–95 Ashes series while just one, Keith Piper, was selected for the England A team's tour of India. Captain Dermot Reeve described this as \"extremely disappointing\" mentioning the names of Tim Munton, Roger Twose, Dominic Ostler and Neil Smith as surprising omissions. Coach Bob Woolmer said it was \"unbelievable\" and also picked out Twose, Ostler and Smith as deserving of a place in the A team at least. Journalist Alan Lee selected a possible 15 man squad before the announcement and chose Twose, Munton, Ostler and Piper.\nFor their performances in 1994 Brian Lara and Tim Munton were both named amongst the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in the 1995 Wisden. Pat Murphy wrote of the Championship celebrations:\nThe biggest cheer, one laced with affection and respect, went to Tim Munton. That was not just for an outstanding personal season, nor for his golden run as stand-in captain for the injured Dermot Reeve, but also for Munton's high standards of professionalism, his durability and his approachability. The supporters had not forgotten Munton selfless performances in many undistinguished seasons for the club, his tireless commitment to his job, his willingness to meet every autograph request and to exchange cheery banter at any time of his working day.\nFollowing the end of the season Bob Woolmer left the club to coach South Africa, his successor was Phil Neale who alongside captain Dermot Reeve led Warwickshire to another successful season. They won two trophies, retaining the County Championship and winning the Natwest Trophy and narrowly missed a third by finishing second to Kent in the Sunday League, losing out on run rate. Allan Donald returned as overseas player and took 88 Championship wickets at 15.48. The major close season signing was Essex opener Nick Knight."

        "title": "Accommodation for the 2003 Afro-Asian Games",
        "text": "Accommodation for the athletes, foreign officials, dignitaries and media personnel attending the 2003 Afro-Asian Games, held in Hyderabad, India, was a major point of difference between these Games and other multi-sport events. Unlike in other major events such as the Olympic Games or the Asian Games, there was no separate \"Games Village\" as such for providing accommodation. This posed a serious problem to the organisers.\nReason and solution.\nThe Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh (SAAP) had initially wanted to have a separate Games Village for the Games, but could not arrange for it. Even though Hyderabad had hosted the 32nd National Games of India in 2002, for which a Games Village had been built, the organizers could not utilise it due to severe financial problems. It was estimated that about Rs 800 million (US$16 million) would be required to upgrade the existing Games Village. The Government of Andhra Pradesh and the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh (SAAP) instead opted to obtain bulk bookings from all the major hotels in the city so as to provide accommodation for the athletes, foreign dignitaries and the media.\nHotels.\nThe total requirement for accommodation was around 4,500. This included various groups of people such as the media, the visiting officers, foreign dignitaries, athletes and coaches etc. These groups of people had to be allotted various hotels in the city.\nTo ease the process of allotment, the people to be accommodated were divided into four broad groups:-\nCategory - 1.\nThis category comprised foreign ministers who were visiting the city to observe the Games, members of the African and Asian committees and certain other representatives. The number of people under this category came to about 550.\nThese people were accommodated in several five-star hotels including the Taj Krishna, ITC Grand Kakatiya and Hotel Sitara.\nCategory - 2.\nThis category comprises all the athletes and non-competing participants (i.e., extras), coaches and team managers. This category comprises the largest chunk of accommodees, numbering to about 2,040. Since this category is itself a \"mixed bunch\", it was further divided according to the participant's sport. Each sport's participants were accommodated in different hotels, hostels and inns. The list of hotels utilized for this purpose is given below:-\nCategory - 3.\nThis category comprises technicians, technical operators, overseers, etc., who had come to supervise the functioning of the technical infrastructure put into place for broadcasting, scores, etc. These people were accommodated in a number of hotels, guest houses, institutes and inns.\nCategory - 4.\nThis category comprises the entire media - newspaper reporters, television reporters, cameramen, their assistants, etc., as well as people from the foreign media who were coming to give exclusive coverage of the Games outside India. These people were accommodated in the Whisper Valley apartments in the posh Jubilee Hills area.\nProblems.\nThe plan of mass hotel bookings, which is a new concept, met with a great deal of problems and criticism. Before the beginning of the Games, the problems were so acute that many people thought that the room shortage would be very large.\nAthlete objections.\nThe allocation of hotels to the athletes was received with a mixed response, with objections from several contingents participating in the Games. The boxing athletes reportedly said that it was \"beneath their dignity\" to be accommodated in Amrutha Castle. Similarly, the swimming officials plainly refused to stay in Hotel Asrani International.\nAvailability.\nThe availability of rooms for the Games was one of the more serious problems affecting the accommodation authorities. In spite of the fact that the Government of Andhra Pradesh had given strict orders to all hotel managements in the city to not accept bookings from anyone else during the period of the Games, the number of rooms required was still not satisfied.\nOther problems.\nThe firm in-charge of conducting the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games made a demand of 500 rooms to be booked only five-star hotels \"and nothing else\". Besides, the hotel managements contracted to provide the accommodation facilities threatened to withdraw the facilities if the promised 50% advance was not paid on time."

        "text": "Pte. Andrew Ross (15 May 1879 – 6 April 1916) was a Scottish rugby union player from Edinburgh. He worked in the Merchant Navy as a marine engineer. He played for Royal High School FP and was capped several times for between 1905 and 1909.\nIn 1910, Ross moved to Vancouver and enlisted with the Canadian Expeditionary Force after the First World War broke out, and was sent to Belgium with the 29th Canadians (Tobin's Tigers). Wounded during the Actions of St Eloi Craters, Ross risked his life to aid other wounded men under heavy fire when he was hit by a shell and killed. He is buried in Ridge Wood Military Cemetery, Belgium.\nEarly life.\nAndrew Ross was born in Newington, Edinburgh, the oldest surviving son of solicitor Andrew Monro Ross, the Ross Herald, and his wife, William Frances Ross (\"née\" Gillon). He had seven siblings. He attended the Royal High School, Edinburgh, where he proved to be an all-round athlete, and an excellent swimmer.\nAged sixteen, he was apprenticed on the \"Glenfyne\", sailing from Dundee, round Cape Horn, to Iquique. After returning to school for a year, he was apprenticed to a firm of engineers. He was also a keen oarsman, rowing with the East of Scotland Rowing Club of Leith.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nAfter leaving school, he played for the Royal High School former pupils team, gaining a reputation as a fast and courageous forward.\nProvincial career.\nHe earned selection for Edinburgh, and on 2 December 1899 played in the Inter City game against Glasgow: it was the first time in ten years that Edinburgh beat Glasgow.\nRoss's career as a marine engineer took him overseas, but returning home in 1904, he played again for Edinburgh, beating Glasgow 6–3. Following this match, he was selected for the Cities District team to play against the Rest on 14 January 1905.\nInternational career.\nHis performance earned him selection for in the Home Nations fixture against at Inverleith on 4 February 1905. Ahead of the game, the press was divided on which side would win, with the Scots having the home advantage and the better forwards, and the absence of Wales's Dick Jones at half back was seen as detrimental. Yet it was reckoned that if the Welsh backs got sufficient ball, they would be too clever for Scotland. The weather would also play a crucial role. For his part, Ross was expected to make \"strong impressions in more than one sense\". Before the game, the \"Evening Express\" said of him: \nIn the event, the weather was fine and favoured Wales, which beat the home team 3–6, in front of 20,000 spectators. The Scottish forwards \"looked a fine, powerful lot\", with their average estimated to be 10 lbs greater than the Welsh. The Scots scored first, through Little, but the Welsh captain, Willie Llewellyn, evened the scores before half time, and sealed the Welsh victory with a second try in the second half.\nRoss was kept on for the rest of the championship, playing against on 25 February, and on 18 March. Against England, he broke his ribs early in the game but played on to the end.\nReturning once again to Scotland in 1909, Ross was recalled to the Scottish XV, playing against Wales on 6 February, and against Ireland on 27 February. Having lost to Wales at home for only the second time in 1905, Scotland repeated the defeat in 1909, losing 3–5 (a penalty to a converted try), in a game that was noted chiefly for poor refereeing.\nMilitary career.\nRoss emigrated to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in 1910, where he was working as a marine engineer. At the outbreak of the First World War, Ross was working near the Arctic Circle. He travelled back to Vancouver from Albert Bay, arriving on 14 November 1914. Two weeks later, according to his correspondence, he was in training with the Second Canadian Division, having joined the 29th Battalion (Vancouver), of the Canadian Expeditionary Force: the battalion was nicknamed \"Tobin's Tigers\" after Lt.-Col. Henry Seymour Tobin, who began recruiting on 14 October 1914. The 29th Canadians embarked for Britain on 20 May 1915, arriving in Devonport in June 1915. After a visit home, Ross joined camp on 30 July. He competed shortly after in the regimental sports at Stamford Bridge, London, before departing for the Western Front, reaching France on 17 September.\nThe normal practice for a division arriving in France was for it to be kept in reserve, for further training in trench warfare, but the 2nd Canadian Division was sent almost immediately into the front line, under the newly formed Canadian Corps. On 28 September, Ross writes that their line is 30 to 250 yards from that of the Germans. He writes again on 23 November of a ruse to bring out the Germans from behind their defences:\nThe role of the Canadians was to execute a policy of \"wearing down\" the enemy, and early on 31 January 1916, the 6th Brigade, including the 29th Battalion, staged a raid on the German position at the Spanbroekmolen salient. The 29th encountered little resistance, and it took them just four and a half minutes to capture three prisoners, bomb the dugouts and return to their own trenches. This action earned the battalion, and other units, recognition from Sir Douglas Haig in his first despatch for \"good work in carrying out... local attacks and raids\".\nAction at St Eloi Craters.\nOn 27 March 1916, following an artillery bombardment, combined with the detonation of mines beneath the German trenches, the British 5th Corps attacked the St Eloi salient. On the night of 3–4 April, the Canadian Corps relieved the British, with the 6th Canadian Brigade taking up positions in front of the craters created by the detonations.\nThe last letter from Ross is dated 4 April 1916. He reports: \"there's lots of fighting where we are at present, and just now we are in the German trenches, so have a busy time... I'd like to see you all again...\" For the next two days, the Canadian front line was under almost continuous bombardment. The 27th Battalion fared particularly badly, and on the night of 5–6 April, the 29th began relieving them, slowed down by the mud, extra equipment and a congestion of troops.\nThe corporal of Ross's section reported his death: \"On the morning of 6 April we were serving together in the trenches. While attending devotedly and most courageously, under heavy artillery fire, to our wounded men, he was himself hit, and falling over a man he was dressing, died instantly. Quite reckless as regarding his own life, he exposed it, and gave it to save, as his quick attention undoubtedly did, the lives of a great number of our men.\" It transpired later that Ross was already wounded before he was himself killed.\nRoss is buried at the Ridge Wood Military Cemetery (Grave IR9), West Flanders, Belgium."

The course was redesigned by renowned golf course architect James Braid in the early 1930s, and was reopened by Vardon.\nThe course was virtually laid waste during the World War II occupation of Jersey by the German Army. Major renovations took place during the 1960s and 70s under the guidance of Henry Cotton, and the course went on to play host to some of the world's top golfers as the venue for tournaments on both the European Tour and the European Seniors Tour. In 2011 Golf Course Manager Richard Cutler led the start of a major redevelopment of the course. It is due to be finished before Christmas 2011."

        "text": "Water Polo has a long and distinguished history in Dorset, and is arguably the location for the world's first ever structured Water Polo match - held in 1876 off Bournemouth Pier.\nThe Dorset &amp; District Water Polo League was set up in 1898 with the sport played in rivers and harbour inlets in the county throughout most of the 20th Century, often in front of crowds of up to 1500 spectators.\nTeams played in county competitions, against touring teams and occasionally went on tours, however the sport faded towards the end of the 20th Century as swimming moved indoors, however a new league was formed in 2004 with a large junior competition based in swimming pools. Coastal Water Polo continues in the summer at both West Bay and Weymouth.\nClub teams in the county compete in a variety of competitions within and outside the county, whilst Dorset county teams compete in the ASA South West Regional Championships annually. Junior, Senior Mens and Senior Ladies County teams also play a fixture against Devon on an annual basis.\nHistory.\nThe World's First Organised Water Polo match - 1876.\nArguably the very first structured form of the modern game ever played was on 13 July 1876 off Bournemouth Pier between seven \"competitors\" on each side. The goals were marked by four flags and positioned to the west of the pier 50 yards apart. After a \"severe struggle the ball burst but the players were undaunted and went on to display their aquatic accomplishments for some time\". Another fixture was held a week later where again the India rubber ball (inside of a football) burst in a game, which was described as \"aquatic handball\". The occasion is now marked with a plaque at the end of the pier.\nThe Dorset &amp; District Water Polo League - 1898.\nThe \"Dorset &amp; District Water Polo League\" was formed around 1898 between Bridport, Dorchester, Weymouth and Yeovil, with Yeovil winning the 1899 league and Weymouth the 1900 league. Fixtures were held on a Thursday evening, with Yeovil playing in their \"Baths\", Dorchester in the \"Poundbury Stream\" and Bridport in the \"Polo Basin\" at West Bay. At the end of each season, the Champions played a combined team from the \"Rest of the League\". Lyme Regis also had a team, although they didn't play in the league.\nOne of these teams, Bridport Swimming Club was formed in 1898 following a meeting at the town hall. An area of the harbour at West Bay was named the \"Polo Basin\" to play in, and a referee's stand was built on the piles, with a goal tied to the outside of one of the piers for practice. An annual club \"regatta\" was held in the summer, which lasted until the late 20th Century, of which the water polo match in front of huge crowds was reported as being the prime event, following the swimming gala. Other than the league matches, various friendly games were played, against teams such as 'A' Company VBDE, Captain v Vice Captains teams, and Residents v Visitors. In 1910 two thousand spectators turned up to watch the town team play Frome, and TV footage from the 1920s/1930s shows Bridport, having moved their pitch from the 'Polo Basin' in the harbour to the river, playing in front of huge crowds of around 1500. A spectator stand was built with regular matches played against local and touring teams there until the late 1980s.\nDorset Water Polo League.\nWe can only assume that water polo continued to flourish when the soldiers returned from the First World War because when the Dorset County Amateur Swimming Association was formed in 1931 it paid for a senior men's championship shield which is still competed for today. The first winners on this trophy were Bridport, the only time the town lifted the championship.\nAfter the Second World War, Portland became the supreme force in Dorset water polo winning the championship shield 21 years on the trot. Weymouth also had a strong water polo side during this time and there was a great deal of local rivalry. It was also a time when water polo was the main event and the crowd was attracted to the game more than the swimming gala, which often preceded it. Weymouth went on to win in 1971 and 1972.\nBridport, another leading club at the time, ran three teams and had regular visits from clubs like the mighty Cheltenham and Weston-super-Mare and touring London sides. During the summer, the team was cheered on by hundreds of holiday makers and locals alike with a match collection making the club very wealthy. Sometimes, Dorset's water polo players had more than their opponents to contend with. During one match at West Bay, a dead sheep floated into the playing area and on another occasion a dog decided to jump in and become one of the players.\nThe Dorset League was at the time a flourishing annual competition with teams from Bridport, Portland, Weymouth, Wareham, Lyme Regis and Swanage taking part. The sport continued to flourish through the post-war period. By the beginning of the 1970s, new indoor pools were being built in most major towns in the county and indeed all over the country. Ironically, this contributed to the decline of water polo as the river and the sea was no longer so attractive to play in. It meant also that for those clubs that still played the game in swimming pools, their playing time was often relegated to less sociable hours with games and practices often ending at 10pm.\nThe Lean Period - 1980s &amp; 1990s.\nAll through the 1980s and 1990s, Bournemouth continued to play in the Hampshire League and still does today. However, from around 1972, the Weymouth and Portland clubs only played the odd game and some players went off to play for Yeovil just over the Somerset border. Bridport continued to play in the River Brit until the late 1980s when flood alleviation work was undertaken.\nHowever, in the mid 1990s there were the \"green shoots\" of revival, as the Wessex Water Polo Club reformed in 1983 started to play in the Wiltshire league and then in the Bristol &amp; West league, winning promotion to Division One in the 1994/95 season. The club reformed in 2001 becoming Weymouth &amp; Portland playing in the Hampshire league and becoming either winners or runners-up many times. Bridport formed a new team at their new swimming pool in 1994, playing friendly matches.\nThe Revival - 2000s.\nIn 2004 a group consisting of existing clubs and new clubs around the county got together to form a new Dorset Water Polo League. In addition to Senior Mens Water Polo, the league added a large mixed Junior element as well as a Senior Ladies competition. The sport has continued to grow and teams are now competing outside the county.\nCompetitions.\nDorset Water Polo League.\nThe Dorset Water Polo League runs from October to June and leagues currently run for the following categories:-\nDorset Water Polo Senior Mens Championship Shield.\nA trophy first competed for in 1931. The current holders are Bournemouth Swimming Club.\nDorset County Team.\nThe county operates a development day once a term basis at St Mary's School, Shaftesbury for players looking to develop their skills. Top level coaches are often brought in to give players a level of training above their clubs.\nCounty teams play at ASA South West Regional Championships on an annual basis in the following categories:-\nIn addition, Dorset resurrected a traditional fixture against Devon in 2008, with Senior Mens, Senior Ladies &amp; Junior Boys competing."

        "title": "John McMullin (baseball)",
        "text": "John F. McMullin (April 1, 1849 – April 11, 1881) was an American professional baseball player. During the first professional league season in , he was the only regular left-handed pitcher, while in later seasons he mainly played the outfield. After playing almost every game throughout the five National Association seasons (1871–1875), he did not play a single game in the National League that succeeded it. He died in his native Philadelphia five years later, only 32 years old.\nEarly life and amateur career.\nMcMullin was born on April 1, 1849, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nIn 1867 the 19-year-old McMullin was a regular outfielder for the Keystone club of Philadelphia in the nominally amateur National Association of Base Ball Players. Keystone fielded Philadelphia's second team by playing strength, behind the Athletics. Half the team scored more than three runs per game, including McMullin with 47 in 13 games now on record.\nProfessional career.\nEarly career.\nFor the 1868 season, two Cincinnati clubs both acquired four or five players from the east; presumably they were compensated somehow. John McMullin joined the Buckeyes and played catcher more than any other position. Evidently the second-best team in the west, they proved (fatally) to be second-best in the city behind the Cincinnati Red Stockings, and did not survive to contest the first openly professional pennant race next season. McMullin returned to his native city, now to be catcher, pitcher, and shortstop for the supreme Athletics. He played 49 of 53 known games in 1869, the leading number, and held his own in the powerful lineup.\nTroy Haymakers.\nFor the 1870 season at age 21, McMullin became a regular pitcher for the Haymakers of Troy, New York, a pro team of average strength, with a powerful lineup but not much pitching. Although there was at least one other regular lefty pitcher on the professional teams of 1870 (Charlie Pabor of the Union of Morrisania), McMullin was the only regular left-hand pitcher in the 1871 National Association (the first pro \"league\" season). McMullin started all 29 games of the 1871 Troy Haymakers season and completed 28, including a game against the Philadelphia Athletics on June 28 which ended with a score of 49–33. In the slugfest, the Troy pitcher gave up all 49 Philadelphia runs (31 of which were earned) on 42 hits and seven walks, while striking out none. The lone game McMullin did not complete took place on September 5 against the Rockford Forest Citys, when he gave up 15 runs (nine earned) in the first eight innings and switched positions with shortstop Dickie Flowers for the ninth. In total, McMullin pitched 249 innings in 1871 and compiled a 12–15 won–lost record, a 5.53 earned run average, and 12 strikeouts. He gave up the most hits (430), walks (75), and earned runs (153) of any pitcher in the National Association. As a batter, he produced a .279 batting average with 32 runs batted in, and stole 11 bases. After this season, McMullin would be limited to occasional appearances as a pitcher.\nNew York Mutuals.\nIn , McMullin played for the New York Mutuals, mainly as a left fielder. In 54 games, his batting average sunk to .254, although he led the Mutuals in walks with 11. McMullin made 3 appearances at pitcher during the year, the first being a start on April 24 against the Washington Nationals, in New York's third game of the season. He pitched a complete game, gave up eight hits and seven runs (two earned) in nine innings, and was credited with the win. His next pitching appearance came on May 18, when he pitched the last four innings of a 24-6 rout against the Brooklyn Eckfords. Although the statistic did not exist then, McMullin was retroactively credited with the save, the only one of his career. His final appearance as a pitcher in 1872 came on June 8, on the other side of a lopsided game, as he entered with a 15-run deficit and pitched the last two innings of an eventual 19-0 loss to the Philadelphia Athletics. McMullin finished the season with a 3.60 ERA in 15 innings.\nPhiladelphia Athletics.\nIn , McMullin joined his hometown Philadelphia Athletics. Again playing mostly left field, he batted .273 with 28 RBIs and 9 stolen bases in 52 games. He made one appearance at pitcher, a complete game victory in which he pitched eight innings and allowed five runs (two earned) on ten hits and a walk.\nMcMullin remained with the Athletics in . Playing mainly in center field, he hit a team-best .346, slugged 10 doubles, two triples, and the first two home runs of his career, scored 61 runs, and drove in 32. Besides batting average, he led the Athletics in hits (90), walks (8), on-base percentage (.366), and on-base plus slugging (.789). McMullin finished fifth in the league in batting average, and third in on-base percentage. However, his 13 strikeouts tied him with Johnny Ryan and Billy Barnie for the most by a batter.\nAlso in 1874, McMullin served as the home plate umpire for a game on October 19 between the Philadelphia White Stockings and the Boston Red Stockings.\nPhiladelphia White Stockings.\nIn , McMullin moved to the crosstown Philadelphia White Stockings. Although his batting average slipped to .257, he continued to hit for power, with nine doubles, four triples, and two home runs among his 57 hits. His two homers led the White Stockings, and his slugging percentage of .360 was second on the team, but he also led the team in times caught stealing, with 10, and strikeouts, with 12. After not pitching at all the prior year, McMullin made four relief appearances for the Whites, posting a 7.94 ERA in 11.1 innings.\nLater career.\nAlthough McMullin did not play in the new National League in , he umpired three games in Philadelphia during the season, on June 14, June 15, and July 21.\nMcMullin played for and managed a Philadelphia-based team in the League Alliance, baseball's first semi-affiliated minor league, in .\nDeath.\nMcMullin died of pneumonia on April 11, 1881, in Philadelphia, and is buried there in Old Cathedral Cemetery."

He was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the first round, 27th pick overall, of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft. He attended Lake Brantley High School where he won numerous awards, including being named the player of the year by the \"Orlando Sentinel\" in 2009. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Seattle Mariners, Tampa Bay Rays, Milwaukee Brewers, and Los Angeles Angels.\nAmateur career.\nIn 2007 and 2008, Franklin played for the USA Baseball Youth National Team, which played in Canada and Venezuela. Franklin attended Lake Brantley High School. He took two months off of baseball after his junior season to weight train. On April 16, 2009 \"Orlando Sentinel\" named Franklin the \"Boy Athlete of the Week\". Franklin was named the \"\"Orlando Sentinel\" Baseball Player of the Year\" in 2009 after he batted .538 with 11 home runs. During his time in high school, a professional baseball scout compared Franklin's skills to that of a \"switch-hitting Michael Young\".\nProfessional career.\nSeattle Mariners.\nFranklin was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the first round of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft. Before being drafted, Franklin committed to play baseball at Auburn University. On August 16, 2009, the Mariners signed Franklin to a contract with a $1.28 million signing bonus. Franklin began his professional career in 2009, splitting the season between the rookie-league AZL Mariners of the Arizona League, and the Class-A Short-Season Everett AquaSox of the Northwest League. In the Arizona league, Franklin batted .302 with six runs, 13 hits, two doubles, one home run, and four runs batted in (RBIs) in 10 games.

Jonathan Mayo, also of MLB.com, said that Franklin has the potential for power, and also noted that \"[Franklin's] got wiry strength and decent speed\". MLB.com rated Franklin a \"solid defender\" and his arm strength \"average\". Seattle Mariners' general manager Jack Zduriencik and scouting director Tom McNamara were reportedly impressed by Franklin's dedication to the game of baseball. On January 25, 2011 MLB.com revealed their top 50 best prospects in baseball list, in which Franklin was listed as the 38th best prospect in Major League Baseball. With the Mariners, Franklin was a relative rarity among big league players in using a batting helmet with two ear flaps (others to use this sort of helmet include Shane Victorino and Shin-Soo Choo). Since joining the Rays he has started using a more conventional one-flap helmet."

Martin played for the Chicago Cardinals, Boston Yanks and \"Card-Pitt\", a team that was the result of a temporary merger between the Chicago Cardinals and the Pittsburgh Steelers. The teams' merger was a result of the manning shortages experienced league-wide due to World War II. He was released from \"Card-Pitt\" after the team's game against the Green Bay Packers, when it was discovered that John McCarthy could average 35 yards per punt. He then signed with the Boston Yanks."

The post-season Play-offs began on April 9 and culminated in the end-of-season finale on May 2 at Wembley Arena.\nStart-up franchise Edinburgh Rocks became the League's newest member following their addition as the 14th franchise during the pre-season and the first Scottish team to appear in the top-flight since Glasgow Rangers' participation in the 1988–89 season. The League membership was reduced to 13 teams shortly after following the merger of the London Towers and Crystal Palace franchises, whilst another notable change was the uprooting of Watford Royals, who moved to the Bletchley Centre in Milton Keynes to become the Milton Keynes Lions.\nSheffield Sharks were a dominant force throughout the season, winning the Sainsbury's Classic Cola Cup whilst storming the Budweiser League and taking the Championship to complete the \"Double\". The campaign came down to a memorable final game where Sharks claimed the title from rivals Manchester Giants with the last shot of the game, winning 85–87 to take the crown.

        "title": "Sydney Rowing Club",
        "text": "Sydney Rowing Club is the oldest rowing club in New South Wales, Australia formed in 1870. It has occupied its current site on Port Jackson's Parramatta River at Abbotsford Point since 1874. The club has a focus on its high performance and elite rowing programs and as of the 2021 Olympic Games, sixty-eight rowers from the club had competed at the Olympic Games rowing in one hundred and two of the seats raced by Australian Olympic crews. Over one hundred club members have achieved national selection.\nClub history.\nA group of sportsmen interested in the advancement of amateur rowing met at the Oxford Hotel in Sydney on 6 March 1870 and the Sydney Rowing club was born. George Thornton a former mayor of Sydney was the club's first President. Its first club house was on a site adjacent to the current Sydney Opera House at Bennelong Point. That clubhouse was opened in August 1870 by His Excellency, the 4th Earl Belmore, the then Governor of New South Wales.\nThe club was founded on the principle of amateurism under the notion popular at the time, that manual labourers being as they were paid for their effort and toil had an unfair advantage in races involving physical exertion. When the New South Wales Rowing Association was formed in the 1870s with some of the SRC directors as driving forces, races were to be conducted by bona-fide amateurs only. The colours of the Sydney Rowing Club were initially blue and white. They were altered to light blue before 1886. The club motto, \"Mens sana in corpore sano\" (\"A healthy mind in a healthy body\") was adopted at the very outset while the club's crest was adopted in 1910.\nIn 1874 the club's Directors arranged for the purchase of a property known as the Red Cow Inn on the point at Abbotsford, seven miles up river from Circular Quay. The Inn had abundant accommodation being located at the end of Great North Road where it met the ferry from Bedlam Point (Gladesville). The site was initially a training and recreation \"branch\" facility with accommodation for members to stop-over. In 1888 the club received notice from the Government to quit its site at Circular Quay and secured another site on the western side of Woolloomooloo Bay between Mrs Macquarie's Chair and the Domain Baths, where the headquarters of the Club remained until 1947.\nThe branch site had been significantly developed in the interim 70-year period and in 1947 the boatshed at Woolloomooloo was dismantled and rebuilt at Abottsford which marked the relocation of all club facilities to Abbotsford.\nCompetition history &amp; representative success.\nFor eight successive years from 1880 to 1888 the SRC won the New South Wales Rowing Association's premiership pennant, a run that wouldn't be matched until 1929 by the Mosman Rowing Club. The Association's premiership was again won continuously from 1903/04 to 1908/09 and when a junior pennant was introduced in 1908/09 that was won too.\nBobby Pearce was the dominant world sculler from the late 20s and along with Herb Turner at the national level in the early 30s, they established Sydney's credentials as a force in single sculls. Merv Wood continued to shine the club's light in sculling in the 40s and 50s.\nFollowing World War II, Australian Olympic teams increased in size; the rowing squad began to send larger crews &amp; boats and Sydney club rowers contributed significantly to representative squads up till the mid 1970s and to a lesser extent ever since.\nSydney and Leichhardt men made up the entire contingent of the squad of thirteen who travelled to Helsinki 1952 with Sydney contributing nine of those athletes. This pattern continued in the next two decades with an entire Sydney coxed four of Alf Duval, Alan Grover, Mick Allan, John Campbell and Gary Herford selected to compete at Tokyo 1964 under coach Phil Cayzer who a few years later recruited a number of national senior rowers to join Duval, Grover, Joe Fazio and Michael Morgan at Sydney to create the men's eight for the 1968 Summer Olympics. Eight of the sixteen man squad for Munich 1972 plus coach Allan Callaway were from the club followed by five of the twelve man squad for Montreal 1976 plus coach Morgan and team official John Coates.\nFrom Amsterdam 1928 until Tokyo 2020 the Sydney club had at least one representative in every Australian Olympic rowing squad with the single exception of Barcelona 1992.\nMembers.\nMembership of the club was male-only until 1993, when the Club decided that it would allow women to become members.\nNotable past members include:\nOlympic representative members include:\nWorld champions include:"

The team played its home games in the Pete Maravich Assembly Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and is a member of the Southeastern Conference. They finished the season 11–20, 2–14 in SEC play and lost in the first round of the 2010 SEC men's basketball tournament.\nPrevious season.\nTrent Johnson completed his first season as head coach of the Tiger men's basketball team in 2009. His first season was very successful as the Tigers won the SEC West division title and the overall SEC regular-season title which earned them the #1 seed in the 2009 SEC men's basketball tournament. As a result of earning the top seed, the Tigers received a first-round bye. The Tigers defeated the Kentucky Wildcats in the second round 67-58. However, Mississippi St. proved to be too much in the semi-finals eliminating the Tigers 57-67.\nAfter the SEC Tournament, the Tigers' fate was in the hands of the NCAA Tournament selection committee. The Tigers were awarded the #8 seed in the South bracket for the 2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. This was the first time the Tigers had made the NCAA tournament since making it to 2006 Final Four. The Tigers had to travel to Greensboro, North Carolina to play the first two rounds of the tournament.\nIn the opening round of the tournament, LSU squared off against the #9 seed Butler, who finished the regular season 26-5. The Tigers seemed to be in control of the game leading by as much as 13, and by a score of 35-29 at the half. However, Butler continued to fight their way back using the size of Matt Howard who finished the game with 22. In the end, though, the Tigers were able to prevail 75-71 behind Marcus Thornton's 30 points.\nThe 2008-09 squad compiled and overall record of 27-8, including a 13-3 mark in SEC play.\nPreseason.\nThe 2009–10 Tigers men's basketball team had a much different look than the team that competed in the previous season. The Tigers replaced the following seniors from 2008–09:\nHowever, Tasmin Mitchell decided to withdraw his name from the 2009 NBA draft and return to LSU for his red-shirt senior season. He joined junior Bo Spencer as the only two starters returning from last year.\nHonors.\nSenior forward Tasmin Mitchell was the only Tiger to receive any preseason accolades. Mitchell was recently named to watchlist for the 2009–10 Naismith Award, as well as being rated the #4 small forward in college basketball by Rivals.com. During SEC media days prior to the season, Mitchell was named a unanimous First Team All-SEC selection by the SEC coaches.\nSchedule.\n! style=\"background:#FFF;color:#461D7C;\"| Regular Season\n! style=\"background:#FFF;color:#461D7C;\"| Post-Season"

        "title": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1898",
        "text": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1898 was the cricket season when the English club Derbyshire had been playing for twenty-seven years. It was their fourth season in the County Championship and they won three matches to finish ninth in the Championship table.\n1898 season.\nDerbyshire played sixteen games in the County Championship in 1898 and one match against MCC. The captain for the year was Sydney Evershed in his eighth season as captain. William Storer was top scorer with three centuries which he achieved while also bowling to take 28 wickets and being a useful wicket-keeper. George Davidson took most wickets at 65 as well as scoring a century. The season saw many high scores, and against Hampshire in August, four Derbyshire players Levi Wright, William Storer, William Chatterton and George Davidson scored centuries followed by two more from the Hampshire players in the same match. The Derbyshire total of 645 runs was to remain their highest match score until it was surpassed in the 2007 season. Two matches later, Yorkshire set a record score against Derbyshire of 662 runs when Jack Brown scored 300 and John Tunnicliffe 243 in Walter Sugg's benefit match before Brown deliberately knocked down his wicket. It remained a national partnership record until two more Yorkshiremen, Percy Holmes and Herbert Sutcliffe, made 555 for the first wicket against Essex at Leyton in 1932.\nThe Yorkshire match was Derbyshire's second match at Queen's Park, Chesterfield, the first being earlier in the season against Surrey. The size of the crowd at that game made the experiment well worth while and the ground, described as mre pleasing to the eye than the County Ground, became a regular venue for several matches a season. The game against Surrey was not without incident as superb lob bowling by D. L. A. Jephson, gave him nine Derbyshire wickets for 55 runs in the two innings, Derbyshire supporters were upset by Jephson's lobs, and protested vigorously against them, saying that this was unfair bowling.\nThe most significant addition to the Derbyshire squad in the season was Billy Bestwick as well known for his antics off the pitch as his demon bowling. William Ellis played the first of several seasons at the club when he played occasional games. Alfred Charlesworth and James Wright also made their debuts and played several matches in the season, although only Wright played in a subsequent season. William Prince, John Bourne and Solomon Hardy each played just one career match for Derbyshire in the season"

        "title": "Malaysian Open (tennis)",
        "text": "The Malaysian Open was a combined men's and women's professional tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts that was originally founded the Malayan Championships. The event has been held at the Bukit Kiara Equestrian &amp; Country Resort and The Royal Selangor Golf Club. The tournament ran from 1921 to 1978. It was revived for a second time from 1992 through to 1995. It was staged for the third and final time from 2009 to 2018.\nHistory.\nThe first edition of the Malayan Championships was played in 1921 in Singapore. Women participated for the first time in 1925. In 1942 the event was suspended due to World War II, it resumed in 1947. In 1949 the tournament was rebranded as the Malaysian International Championships. On 16 September 1963 the country changed its name, from Malaya to Malaysia. In 1971 the tournament was rebranded as the Malaysian Open Tennis Championship, which continued through till 1978 before it ceased to be held.\nIn 1992 the women's tournament was reestablished as the Malaysian Tennis Classic. It was competed on indoor hard courts in Kuala Lumpur. The tournament was part of the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) Tour, and was designated as a Tier IV event. Winners received $18,000. In both years it was held from 19 April to 26 April. The event was discontinued from 1993 onwards. In 1993 the men's tournament was revived as the Kuala Lumpur Open (aka Malaysia Salem Open) which ran until 1995. The men's event was played on hard courts in 1993 and on indoor carpet courts from 1994 to 1995. It was an event on the ATP World Series, replacing the Singapore Open for this period. Four Malaysian Players (V. Selvam, Mon S Sudesh, Martin. A and A. Lourdesamy) were banned for participating in the Bridgestone Open that was simultaneous with the Kuala Lumpur Open, as the Bridgestone Tournament wasn't sanctioned by the LTAM. Selvam's banned was lifted after two years by the LTAM.\nIn 2009 the men's tournament was revived as the Proton Malaysian Open that ran until 2015 as an ATP World Tour 250 fixture. In 2016 the men's event was replaced on the ATP tour by the Chengdu Open. In 2010 the women's tournament was revived for the second time. Initially, the organisers operated with a license directly from WTA. However, later on they cut a deal for a lease of WTA Palermo's license in late-2013.\nIn 2017, the Women's Tennis Association deleted reference to Israeli player Julia Glushko's nationality and Israel's flag from Glushko's profile on their website ahead of her scheduled participation at the Malaysian Open, when event organizers requested all references to her being Israeli be removed from the WTA website in order for her to be allowed to take part in the event. The WTA subsequently reinstated them.\nThe last men's Malaysian Open was held in 2015 and the women's in 2017, after which, WTA Palermo returned to the tour calendar in 2019. The event was affiliated with the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), and is an International-level tournament on the WTA Tour."

For the first time in the league’s history, the 13 teams were split into two geographically divided Conferences, seven in the North and six in the South, with northern teams playing 36 games and southern teams playing 34 games each. The season was dominated by the success of Manchester Giants, conquering the Northern Conference and Championship Play-offs, whilst London Towers were victorious in the Southern Conference and the uni-ball Trophy. Sheffield Sharks were also successful in defending their Sainsbury's Classic Cola National Cup.\nLondon Towers featured in European competition, participating in the Saporta Cup, though with a 3-7 record they finished at the bottom of Group G and thus failed to progress beyond the Group stage. Cross-town rivals Greater London Leopards also made a brief appearance in the Korać Cup but following a 155-189 aggregate defeat to ÍRB Reykjanesbær in the Preliminary round, their first foray into Europe was merely a cameo.\nThe Southern All-Stars beat their Northern rivals in the eleventh annual All-Star Game with a 177-180 victory, the closest result in the League's history.

        "title": "Structure of rugby union in New Zealand",
        "text": "Rugby union in New Zealand is structured into four tiers. The top tier is composed of the national representative teams, with the men's team – known as the All Blacks – and the women's team - known as the Black Ferns, at the top, followed by other representative sides such as the Junior All Blacks and Māori All Blacks. These national sides are administered by the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU). Below this level is Super Rugby, where there are five New Zealand sides, each representing a different region of the country. Below this level is provincial rugby, the third tier – each province has a representative side that plays in either the semi-professional Bunnings Warehouse NPC, or amateur Heartland Championship. These provincial sides are selected of Super Rugby players, and club players from within the province. Club rugby is the fourth and lowest tier, and consists of clubs competing in local leagues organised by a provincial union.\nThere are 26 provincial unions and each administers their own club competitions. Within these provinces there are over 520 clubs who are affiliated both to their province and the NZRU. The number of clubs in each province varies from six for the smallest unions such as West Coast to more than 30 for bigger unions such as Canterbury and Auckland. Many clubs pre-date the existence of the provincial or national unions.\nLevel 1: Bunnings Warehouse NPC.\nThe National Provincial Championship (NPC) was founded in 1976.\nThe Bunnings Warehouse NPC, previously known as the Mitre 10 Cup, which was renamed from the ITM Cup after a 2016 sponsorship change, is fully professional and the competition usually runs from late July or early August to late October. From 2006, when the then Air New Zealand Cup replaced NPC division one, through to 2010, the competition contained 14 teams in a nationwide tournament. Starting with the 2011 season, the ITM Cup was split into two divisions, each with seven teams—the top-level Premiership and second-level Championship. Each division remained a nationwide tournament, although one that declined in perceived importance, as Ron Palenski described: \"For all its success, the NPC is now seen as a lesser competition by New Zealand Rugby (formerly the New Zealand Rugby Union), which gives priority to the Super Rugby teams.\"\nWith the split into two divisions, promotion and relegation was reintroduced into the top level; the bottom side in the Premiership is relegated to the Championship and replaced by that division's champion.\nIn 2021, Bunnings Warehouse were named as the new sponsors for domestic rugby in New Zealand on a three year deal. They restructured the NPC with all 14 teams now united in the same division but now with two conferences called 'Evens' and 'Odds' which was derived from their previous final placing. The promotion and relegation that was present before was therefore removed. \nThe previous season's playing schedule would remain of ten regular season games, with five each both home and away and four crossover matches involving randomly drawn opponents from the other conference alongside the other six teams in each team's own conference. As all fourteen teams are now in the same competition, they will now compete for a quarter-final berth as opposed to a semi-final berth previously. \nThe current Bunnings Warehouse NPC teams, as of the 2022 season, are:\nLevel 2: Heartland Championship.\nThe Heartland Championship is not fully professional. Like the Bunnings Warehouse NPC, the Heartland Championship is also a nationwide competition. The winners do not gain promotion to the NPC, so the Heartland Championship teams have remained the same since 2006. The Championship generally runs from late August to late October. The Heartland Championship contains 12 teams, 8 of which came from the NPC 3rd division in 2006 with the other already in the NPC 2nd division. The 12 teams in the Heartland Championship are:\nLevel 3 and below: Regional Leagues.\nThe club season in New Zealand usually runs from March until late July or early August in any given year and amateur clubs compete on a regional basis. The sides play in intra provincial competitions against other teams from within their own provincial unions boundaries and this is the highest level of club play possible. There is no National club league, or nationwide competition for amateur club rugby.\nMost of the 26 provincial unions have a number of divisions of club rugby within their province, particularly larger unions who may have as many as 6 or 7 tiers of club leagues. Some smaller Unions only have 1 division however. Some unions have promotion and relegation between their divisions, while in others, clubs are represented in several divisions, and in those cases, the players are promoted or demoted within their own club to/from that club's higher level team. Playing premier division one club rugby (also called \"Seniors\" in some provinces) in any union is the highest level of club rugby in New Zealand. In order to play in the Nationwide Representative competitions, The Bunnings Warehouse NPC and Heartland Championship players must be selected, usually due to their form during the club season which precedes the Provincial representative season. Therefore, a representative player will play both for a club and a provincial team in the same season. This is grassroots rugby."

Their head coach was Brad Stevens, serving his 3rd year. The Bulldogs played their home games at the Hinkle Fieldhouse, which has a capacity of approximately 10,000.\nThe Bulldogs won the 2010 Horizon League men's basketball tournament to receive the Horizon's automatic bid to the 2010 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, earning a 5 seed in the West Region.

The team next defeated 1 seed Syracuse to advance to the Elite Eight for the first time in school history, and then defeated 2 seed Kansas State to earn their first Final Four appearance in school history. They were only the second team from a mid-major conference to \"officially\" advance that far in the tournament since UNLV made the Final Four in 1991.\nOn April 3, 2010, Butler defeated Michigan State and advanced to the National Championship game against Duke. On April 5, just a few miles away from the Bulldogs' home court, Duke defeated Butler 61-59 in a back and forth game that ratings showed was the highest-rated Championship game of the decade.\"\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Italy Exhibition Trip\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Horizon League Play\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Horizon League Tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| NCAA tournament\nPreseason.\nFueled in large part by Gordon Hayward's and Shelvin Mack's roles leading team USA to the gold medal in the FIBA Under-19 World Championship during the off-season, Butler began the season ranked 10th in the Coaches' Poll and 11th in the AP Poll.

The win extended Butler's nation-leading winning streak to 20 in a row.\nNCAA tournament.\n3/18 – Butler vs #25 (12 seed) Texas-El Paso (NCAA tournament – round 1)&lt;br&gt;\nBulldogs Advance Past UTEP To NCAA Second Round\nOf the 32 first-round games, the match up between Butler and UTEP was the only one featuring two nationally ranked teams (UTEP was ranked 24th entering the game). Many basketball commentators picked UTEP to pull the upset, and in the first half of the game it looked like they might be right. UTEP outplayed Butler to take a 33–27 halftime lead. Stevens rallied the team, and the Bulldogs came out firing on all cylinders in the second half. Shelvin Mack hit two three-pointers within 90 seconds to tie the game and ignite a 22–4 run to start the half. Butler won the game 77–59 sinking 13 three-pointers. Shelvin Mack led the team with 25 points.\n3/20 – Butler vs (13 seed) Murray St. (NCAA tournament – round 2)&lt;br&gt;\nLate Defense Sends Bulldogs To Sweet 16\nIn the second round, Butler faced off with 13th seeded Murray State. The game was close throughout and was tied at 50 with a minute to go. Ronald Nored put Butler ahead with a layup and added a free throw to make it 53–50 with 25.4 seconds remaining. Murray State made two free throws to cut the gap, but was forced to foul Matt Howard to extend the game. Howard hit 1 of 2 free throws, giving Murray State a chance to tie or win the game on its final possession. With less than five seconds on the clock, Hayward deflected a Murray State pass into the back court. By the time the ball was recovered, the game was over and Stevens was heading to his first Sweet Sixteen.\n3/25 – Butler vs. #4 (1 seed) Syracuse (NCAA tournament – Sweet Sixteen)&lt;br&gt;\nButler Headed To Elite Eight\nButler faced top-seeded Syracuse. Unlike their first two games, the Bulldogs got off to a good start, jumping out to a 12–1 lead and taking a 35–25 lead to the break. Syracuse rallied in the second half, taking its first lead of the game, 40–39, off a Wes Johnson three-pointer. Stevens called timeout and Butler regained the lead on its next possession. The game remained tight for the next several minutes. At the 5:32 mark, Syracuse got a rare fast break opportunity that ended with a dunk and 54–50 lead. Stevens again called time out and Butler responded by holding Syracuse scoreless for the next 5 minutes. Butler took a 60–54 lead on a Willie Veasley tip in at the 0:59 mark and held on to win 63–59. The win allowed Butler to advance to the Elite Eight for the first time in school history.\n3/27 – Butler vs. #7 (2 seed) Kansas St. (NCAA tournament – Elite Eight)&lt;br&gt;\nBU's NEXT STOP: Final Four In Indy!\nThe Bulldogs met 2nd-seeded Kansas State in the regional finals. Perhaps feeling the effects of their double overtime 101–96 win two days prior, Kansas State got off to a slow start, scoring just 20 points in the first half to trail 27–20. Butler kept the lead in the upper single digits for most of the second half and led 49–39 with 7:38 to go. Kansas State then went on a 13–2 and took a 52–51 lead on a Denis Clemente 3-pointer with 4:50 to go. Brad Stevens immediately called time out and re-focused the team. \"Play your game. Just play your game\" he told the team. On the ensuing possession, Hayward pulled down an offensive rebounded on a Mack miss and was fouled. He hit both free throws and Butler didn't trail again, out-scoring Kansas State 12–2 before the Wildcats hit a meaningless shot at the buzzer to make the final margin 63–56. When asked how Butler won the game, Howard said \"It’s all five guys out there defending, helping each other\".\nIn the post game celebration, Stevens and walk-on forward Emerson Kampen connected on a flying back-bump that soon became one of the iconic images of the tournament. Stevens adopted the move after he saw it bringing together teammates during pregame rituals. Stevens and Kampden did a back-bump in the locker room after the Murray State and Syracuse games, revealing it to the public after beating Kansas State.\nThe win earned the Bulldogs a trip back to Indianapolis for the first Final Four appearance in school and Horizon League history. The win made Stevens, at age 33, the youngest coach to lead a team to the Final Four since Bob Knight made his first Final Four appearance at age 32 in 1973. Butler became the smallest school (enrollment 4,200) to make the Final Four since seeding began in 1979.\n4/3 – Butler vs. #13/#12 (5 seed) Michigan St. (NCAA tournament – Final Four)&lt;br&gt;\nBulldogs Advance To National Title Game\nBrad Stevens and the Butler Bulldogs faced off with Michigan State in the national semi-finals. Korie Lucious opened the game by hitting two straight three-pointers, but Gordon Hayward responded with two three-pointers of his own to tie the score at 6. Butler took a 7–6 lead on a Shelvin Mack free throw before Michigan State went on an 8–0 run. Matt Howard got in early foul trouble and sat most of the first half. Butler fought back though, tying the game at 28 on a Mack three-pointer with 35 seconds left in the first half.\nLucious hit another three to open the second half, giving Michigan State a 31–28 lead. The teams traded the lead a few times before Mack hit a layup to put Butler up 34–33 with 17:43 to go. Butler then held Michigan State scoreless for the next 3:30, pushing the lead to 38–33. After two free throws by Howard made the Butler lead 46–41 with 9:24 to go, both teams locked down on defense. The score was 47–44 with 2:45 to go in the game when Michigan State called a time out to set up a play. Stevens correctly anticipated the play call and had Ronald Nored, the team's best defender, switch onto Lucious off a screen. Nored stole the ball and Shawn Vanzant got fouled on the resulting run out, hitting 1 of 2. After a Draymond Green jump shot cut the lead to 48–46, Hayward got a layup off an offensive rebound by Willie Veasley. Durrell Summers then got fouled with 1:18 remaining. He hit the first free throw, but missed the second. However, Michigan State got an offensive rebound and Green was fouled. He made both foul shots to bring Michigan State within a point with 56 seconds to go. Butler came up empty on its possession, giving Michigan State a chance to take the lead. Green missed a layup with 8 seconds on the clock and Nored came down with the rebound. He was quickly fouled. Nored, who had shot only 61% on the year and 3 of 12 during the tournament on free throws, hit both shots to give Butler a 52–49 lead. After a Michigan State time out, Butler intentionally fouled Lucious with 2 seconds remaining to prevent a potentially game tying 3-pointer. After making the first, Lucious intentionally missed the second free throw. Hayward came down with the rebound, his ninth of the game, to seal the victory.\nButler won the game despite shooting just 30.6% for the game and going without Howard and Mack for a large portion of the second half. Howard hit his head and left the game dazed, while Mack was experiencing leg cramps. Michigan State coach Tom Izzo called it \"one of the more physical games we've been involved in.\" He added \"I like the way they play, I like their story. They play like a Big Ten team.\" Of 595 games played on neutral courts during the 2009–10 season, Butler's 30.6% was the third-lowest shooting percentage by a winning team. Butler became the first team since the shot clock was adopted for the 1985–86 season to hold five straight tournament opponents under 60 points.\n4/5 – Butler vs. #3 (1 seed) Duke (NCAA tournament – Championship Game)&lt;br&gt;\nOn April 5, 2010, Butler became the smallest school to play for a National Championship since Jacksonville in 1970, facing Duke, who was seeking its fourth national championship. \"The New York Times\" called the game \"the most eagerly awaited championship game in years\".\nDuke jumped out to a 6–1 lead to start the game, but Butler rallied back, taking a 12–11 lead at the 12:28 mark of the first half. At the under eight-minute TV timeout, Butler held a 20–18 lead. After the timeout, Duke went on an 8–0 run to take a 26–20 lead. Coach Stevens then called a timeout. With starters Matt Howard and Ronald Nored on the bench in foul trouble, backup center Avery Jukes hit two three-pointers and a made tip-in en route to 10 first half points, tying his single-game season high. At half time, Duke's lead stood at 33–32.\nThe second half was played very closely, with neither team taking a lead larger than two points until a Brian Zoubek layup put Duke up 47–43 with 12:27 remaining. Butler stayed within 5 points the rest of the way. With 3:16 to play, Duke took a 60–55 lead on two made free throws by Nolan Smith. Butler missed its next shot, but forced a missed shot and turned Duke over after an offensive rebound. Matt Howard made a layup for Butler to make it a 60–57 game with 1:44 remaining. Smith missed a layup for Duke and Howard made another layup after collecting an offensive rebound on a missed three-pointer by Shelvin Mack. Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski then called a time out. Kyle Singler missed a jump shot from the right corner with 36 seconds remaining, giving Butler a chance to take the lead. Butler was unable to initiate their offense and Stevens called a timeout to set up a play. They were then forced to call their last timeout when they were unable to get the ball in-bounds. Next, Gordon Hayward missed a short fade-away jumper while being defended by center Brian Zoubek. Zoubek came down strong with the rebound, forcing Butler to foul with less than 3.6 seconds remaining. Zoubek made the first foul shot and then intentionally missed the second, likely knowing Butler had no timeouts remaining. Hayward threw a desperation shot from half court. The ball bounced off the backboard and then the rim. According to an analysis by ESPN, Hayward's aim was off by three inches (7.6 cm), or less than one degree, on the x-axis.\nThe loss ended the winningest season in school history. It also snapped Butler's 25-game winning streak, which was also a school record. The following day President Barack Obama called and congratulated the team, despite the loss. \"I just didn't want to call the winner because you guys grabbed the nation's attention. We appreciate the way you guys play.\" he told the team."

        "title": "Swimming at the 1972 Summer Olympics – Men's 200 metre backstroke",
        "text": "The men's 200 metre backstroke event at the 1972 Summer Olympics took place on September 2 at the Olympia Schwimmhalle. There were 36 competitors from 23 nations, with each nation having up to 3 swimmers. The podium was very similar to the previous Games in 1968, with Roland Matthes of East Germany winning gold and the United States taking the other two medals, including one going to Mitch Ivey. Matthes and Ivey were the first two men to earn multiple medals in the event, with Matthes the first to win back-to-back championships and Ivey adding his 1972 bronze to his 1968 silver. Mike Stamm was the silver medalist in Munich. Matthes also defended his 1968 100 metre backstroke title, giving him the backstroke double a second time.\nBackground.\nThis was the fourth appearance of the 200 metre backstroke event. It was first held in 1900. The event did not return until 1964; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games. From 1904 to 1960, a men's 100 metre backstroke was held instead. In 1964, only the 200 metres was held. Beginning in 1968 and ever since, both the 100 and 200 metre versions have been held.\nTwo of the 8 finalists from the 1968 Games returned: gold medalist Roland Matthes of East Germany and silver medalist Mitch Ivey of the United States. The American team also included Mike Stamm, who had briefly held the world record in the event in 1970 before Matthes broke it in 1970 (and then bettered his own record in 1971 and at the East German Olympic trials in 1972).\nBrazil, Cambodia (then Khmer Republic), El Salvador, and Yugoslavia each made their debut in the event. Italy and the Netherlands each made their fourth appearance, the only two nations to have competed at each appearance of the event to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a two-round (heats and final) format. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. There were 5 heats of up to 8 swimmers each. The top 8 swimmers advanced to the final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used backstroke. Because an Olympic-size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nThese were the standing world and Olympic records (in seconds) prior to the 1964 Summer Olympics.\nMike Stamm broke the Olympic record with a time of 2:07.51 in the second heat. Roland Matthes broke that record with 2:06.62 in the fifth heat. Matthes's final time of 2:02.82 is considered equal to his prior world record of 2:02.8. In all, six of the finalists beat the old Olympic record set in 1968; four were better than the record set in the heats."

        "text": "The men's 500 metres speed skating competition of the Vancouver 2010 Olympics was held at Richmond Olympic Oval on 15 February 2010.\nTrack maintenance issues.\nCompetition was stopped for approximately ninety minutes during the first run, due to concerns over the naturally deteriorating quality of the ice after so many skaters had raced on it and the seeming inability of resurfacing equipment to do anything about it. The two ice resurfacing machines prepared to maintain the surface of the ice track both malfunctioned. A reserve machine was employed, but it left the ice surface too rough and pitted to permit safe racing by the athletes. Finally, one of the original two machines was repaired sufficiently to fix the track. Said Arie Koops, director of Dutch speed skating of the delay and who felt that the third machine wasn't properly prepared, \"When skaters are not prepared for a race you don't send them out. It should be the same with the resurfacing machine. If one machine was broken, they should have prepared the third. It was standing there in the garage. I have never seen anything like this.\" A Zamboni brand resurfacer is being brought in from Calgary for the remainder of the games. American skater Shani Davis withdrew from the event, citing fatigue.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\n500 meters (1 race)\n500 meters x 2 (2 races)\nNo new world or Olympic records were set during this competition. The track records of 34.80 s and 69.73 s set by Lee Kang-seok on 15 March 2009 were also not broken."

Kramer finished the race in a time of 12:54.50, under the impression that he had won the gold medal in a new Olympic and track record, but was then told by his coach, Gerard Kemkers, that he had been disqualified. Kemkers took the blame for the gaffe, as he had directed Kramer into the inner lane, even when Kramer was attempting to take the correct outer lane.\nThe gold medal instead was won by Lee Seung-hoon in 12:58.55, edging the existing Olympic record by 0.37 seconds. Despite Lee's earlier silver medal at the 5000 m race, his achievement was a surprise, since, before 2010, he had never skated a 10,000 m race under 14 minutes. He broke his personal and the Korean national record, set on 10 January 2010, by 22.5 seconds. Kramer's disqualification allowed Bob de Jong to earn his third Olympic medal on the 10,000 m (he won silver in 1998 and gold in 2006), a feat only equalled by Knut Johannesen, who won silver, gold and bronze at the Olympics in 1956, 1960 and 1964.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following new Olympic record was set during this competition.\nThe Richmond Olympic Oval track record remained at 12:55.32, set by Sven Kramer on 14 March 2009."

The club plays in the Lancashire League, and has done so since its formation in 1892. The Lancashire League requires that each club plays one professional in each match. Traditionally, clubs in the league have hired a number of international and first-class players. Nelson's first professionals, for the 1892 season, were England Test player, Willis Cuttell and Derbyshire bowler, John Hulme. In 1900, the league rules were amended so that only one professional could be appointed per season. Since then, a number of famous players have represented the club, including Learie Constantine, Kapil Dev and Steve Waugh. Current Australia spin-bowler Nathan Hauritz played for the side in the 2005 season.\nAs of 2011, former West Indies batsman Keith Arthurton has the highest batting average of all the professionals, attaining an average of 113.66 in 10 matches in the 2000 campaign. Fellow West Indian, Learie Constantine, achieved the highest individual score to date of 192 not out against East Lancashire on 2 August 1937. Australian Joe Scuderi, who played over 120 games for the side in 12 seasons, holds both the professional and amateur records for the most runs in a single season. In 1991, he broke the professional record, amassing 1,414 runs in his first year with Nelson. He went on to surpass the amateur tally in 2005, scoring 1,135 runs. So far, the only professional bowlers to have taken all 10 wickets in an innings were Constantine, who conceded only 10 runs in the process against Accrington on 12 May 1934, and South African medium-pacer Anthonie Ferreira, who achieved the feat against the same club on 25 June 1988.\nKey.\nBatting:\nBowling/Fielding:"

        "title": "2010–11 Ashes series",
        "text": "The 2010–11 Ashes series (known as the Vodafone Ashes Series for sponsorship reasons) was the 66th series of Test cricket matches played to contest The Ashes. The series was played in Australia as part of the England cricket team's tour of the country during the 2010–11 season. Five Tests were played from 25 November 2010 to 7 January 2011. England won the series 3–1 and retained the Ashes, having won the previous series in 2009 by two Tests to one. It was the first time in 24 years that England had won the Ashes in Australia. As of 2023, it remains the most recent occasion that a visiting team has won an Ashes series, and the last time that England has won a Test series in Australia.\nBackground.\nPrior to the start of the 2010–11 Ashes series, Australia had won 31 series to England's 29. The remaining five were draws. England won the most recent series in 2009 by two Tests to one, but Australia had whitewashed the last one held on Australian soil (the 2006–07 series), winning 5–0. The last time England won the Ashes on Australian soil was in 1986–87.\nThe two countries also met in the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 final in Bridgetown, Barbados on 16 May, with England winning by seven wickets with three overs to spare to claim their first ICC world championship. The two sides also played each other in England in June and July 2010 in a five-match ODI series as a prelude to the upcoming summer. England won the first three ODIs to claim the series, but the Australians won the last two.\nThe Australians remained in England to face Pakistan, losing both Twenty20 Internationals and drawing a two-Test series 1–1. England, meanwhile, beat Bangladesh 2–1 in a three-match ODI series and beat Pakistan in a controversial series – 3–1 in a four-match Test series, 2–0 in two T20Is and 3–2 in a five-match ODI series.\nIn the weeks leading up to the Ashes, Australia faced both India and Sri Lanka in India and Australia respectively. Australia played India in two Tests and three ODIs during October. They lost both Tests, and lost the ODI series 1–0, with the first and third games washed out without any cricket played. Sri Lanka faced Australia during the early part of November with Sri Lanka winning the only Twenty20 International and winning the ODI series 2–1.\nVenues.\nAs with other recent Ashes series in Australia, this series was played at the main cricket grounds in Australia's five largest cities. Tickets for the Ashes series started selling on 25 July 2010, and within a week many Test days were sold out.\nSquads.\nThe England squad was announced on 23 September 2010. In addition to England's 16-man squad, a 15-man Performance Programme squad was named that also toured Australia during the series. That squad arrived in Brisbane on 13 November, before playing a four-day match against a Queensland XI (25–28 November) and a Western Australia XI (7–10 December) in Perth before departing on 16 December.\nA 17-man Australian squad was announced on 15 November 2010 for the first Ashes Test, and the squad was reduced to 13 five days later. The players included in that initial squad but who were not part of a final Test squad are marked with an asterisk below. In addition to the original 17-man squad, left-arm spinner Michael Beer and left-handed opening batsman Phillip Hughes were later called up for the final three Tests. When captain Ricky Ponting was ruled out of the final Test with a broken finger, Michael Clarke took over as captain and Brad Haddin became vice-captain.\nMatches.\nFirst Test.\nOn the opening day, Peter Siddle – celebrating his 26th birthday – took a hat-trick and achieved his best Test career figures to date with 6/54. He dismissed Cook (caught Watson), Prior (bowled) and Broad (lbw) to take the first Ashes hat-trick since Darren Gough took three wickets in Sydney in 1999. The hat-trick reduced England from a comfortable 4/197 to 7/197, and England were eventually all out in their first innings for 260. Debutant Xavier Doherty took his first Test wicket by dismissing Ian Bell during the innings.\nIn reply, Australia were reduced to 5/143, before Michael Hussey (195) and Brad Haddin (136) compiled a partnership of 307 runs, a record sixth-wicket partnership at the Gabba, to guide Australia to finish on 481 all out. Although bowler Steven Finn finished with figures of 6/125 on his Ashes debut, England conceded a 221-run first innings deficit.\nBut in the second innings, England responded with an impressive top-order performance. Strauss (110) and Cook (235 not out) made a 188-run opening partnership; an English record at the ground, during which they overtook Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe as England's highest-scoring pair of opening batsmen. Jonathan Trott (135 not out) then joined Cook for an unbeaten 329-run partnership before England declared on 1/517 in anticipation for a draw. Cook's score of 235 not out broke Don Bradman's record for the highest Test score at the Gabba.\nWith the target at 297 runs from 41 overs for victory, Australia moved to 1/107, with Ricky Ponting making a quick 51, before a draw was declared.\nSecond Test.\nFor the second Test, Australia made two changes to its fast bowling attack; dropping Mitchell Johnson and Ben Hilfenhaus and bringing in Doug Bollinger and Ryan Harris. England fielded an unchanged side. After electing to bat first, Australia made their worst start to a Test match in 60 years. Simon Katich hesitated when Shane Watson called for a single and was run out without facing a ball by Jonathan Trott, who registered a direct hit with just one stump to aim at. Anderson then had Ponting caught by Graeme Swann at second slip with the next delivery for a golden duck. Katich's diamond duck was the first by an Australian since Wayne Phillips against the West Indies in Port of Spain in 1983-84. In his next over, Anderson then got Clarke to edge to Swann to leave Australia at 3/2. Michael Hussey made 93 before Swann had him caught by Collingwood and Australia were bowled out just before stumps on Day 1 for 245.\nOn the second day, England captain Andrew Strauss was dismissed for a single in the first over of the day's play, bowled by a Bollinger delivery that he left alone. At the close of day two, Alastair Cook had made 136 not out; when combined with his score of 235 not out in the second innings of the first Test, Cook broke the England record for runs scored and minutes at the crease without being dismissed. This consisted of 371 runs in 1,022 minutes of play.\nEarly on the third morning, Kevin Pietersen reached his first century since March 2009 before Cook was out for 148. Supported first by Paul Collingwood (42) and then Ian Bell (68 not out), Pietersen reached the second double-century of his career. Pietersen was finally out for a Test-best 227 before England declared on 5/620. This was the first time that the England team had passed the 500 run mark in successive innings in the Ashes and left Australia needing 375 runs to make England bat again.\nAustralia began batting early on day four and started a fightback before losing the wicket of Michael Clarke (80) off the last ball of the day from Pietersen's part-time off-spin. Although Hussey completed a half-century, England took the final six wickets in the final morning session to win by an innings and 71 runs, beginning with Steven Finn taking the key wicket of Hussey by getting him into a mistake on a pull shot that went to Anderson at mid-on. Anderson then claimed the next two, including notably Ryan Harris on a first-ball LBW. With two first-ball ducks, Harris became only the second Australian in Test cricket to earn a king pair (the first being Adam Gilchrist against India in Kolkata in 2000–01). Swann then provided the finishing touch with his 10th five-wicket haul in Tests and first against Australia by claiming the last three wickets of North, Doherty and Siddle; the wicket of North was originally not called but confirmed LBW by DRS. The result was the 100th time England had beaten Australia in a Test match.\nThird Test.\nFollowing an innings defeat, Australia made four changes, with pace bowlers Johnson and Hilfenhaus returning in place of Bollinger and Doherty, Steve Smith (at that time considered an all-rounder) replacing North in the middle-order, and opener Phillip Hughes replacing the injured Katich. Australia's bowling attack comprised four main pace bowlers and Smith as the main spinner. England made one change, with Chris Tremlett chosen to replace the injured Broad.\nOn the first day, Tremlett marked his return to Test cricket with three top-order wickets as Australia were reduced to 5/69. However, the middle-lower order rescued Australia with Michael Hussey, Brad Haddin and Mitchell Johnson scoring half-centuries. Australia were finally bowled out for 268 runs.\nOn the second day, England reached 0/78 before suffering a batting collapse with Johnson taking 6/38. In a spell costing just 7 runs, he accounted for Cook (32), Trott (4), Pietersen (0) and Collingwood (5) to leave England 5/98. Strauss and Bell made half-centuries before Johnson took two further wickets as England were all out for 187.\nStarting their second innings with a lead of 81 runs, Australia lost Hughes, Ponting and Clarke cheaply before Hussey and Watson steadied the innings with a 113-run partnership. Watson fell five short of his century, but Hussey recorded his second century of the series before a late flurry of wickets left Australia being bowled out for 309. Hussey was last-man-out for 116 and that wicket completed Tremlett's maiden Test five-wicket haul.\nNeeding 391 runs for victory, England quickly collapsed to 5/81. Johnson picked up two more wickets, and Ben Hilfenhaus collected his first since the opening over of the series as the openers and Pietersen fell cheaply. Ricky Ponting damaged a finger parrying Trott to wicket-keeper Haddin in the penultimate over, before Paul Collingwood was caught behind off Harris from the last ball of the day. On day four, the remaining England batsmen were quickly bowled out within ten overs. The final five wickets fell for just 42 runs with Ryan Harris taking 6/47. England were all out for 123 and lost the game by 267 runs. For his combined 63 runs and 9/82, Johnson won the Man of the Match award.\nFourth Test.\nDespite being the series' leading wicket-taker, Steven Finn was rested by England for the much-anticipated Boxing Day Test and replaced by Tim Bresnan, who had been with Collingwood, Broad and Swann in the T20 side that had beaten Australia in the ICC World Twenty20 Final back in May. James Anderson was cleared to play after a slight side strain. Australia were unchanged, with Ricky Ponting also cleared to play despite a fractured little finger on his left hand.\nStrauss won the toss and elected to bowl. Watson was dropped twice without scoring off Anderson before Tremlett claimed his wicket. Tremlett later had Ponting caught behind before Anderson took the vital wicket of Hussey, who had achieved at least fifty in every innings of the series, in the last over before lunch. None of the Australian batsmen offered much resistance as they were bowled out for 98 before tea: their lowest Ashes total at the MCG. All ten dismissals were catches behind the stumps, with Matt Prior becoming the fourth English wicket-keeper to take six catches in an innings; of the remaining catches, two were taken at slip and two at gully. Anderson and Tremlett took four wickets each while Bresnan took the remaining two.\nIn reply, England's openers advanced to 0/157 at the end of the first day's play before both fell early the following morning. Australia reviewed a caught-behind appeal for Pietersen when on 49, which upheld Aleem Dar's not out verdict; however, Ponting continued to debate the decision with both umpires and was fined 40% of his match fee. Pietersen was out soon after for 51 and was followed by Collingwood (8) and Bell (1). Prior was then given out caught behind early in his innings; however, Dar called for the third umpire for a suspected no ball. This was confirmed and Prior continued to support Trott, eventually making 85 while Trott achieved his fifth Test century and eventually finished not out on 168 as England reached 513 all out. Australia had a bright spot in Victoria native and state captain Siddle, who took a six-wicket haul, but they lost Harris for the rest of the series when he fractured his ankle in a run-up.\nBy the time they began their second innings, Australia were in a worse situation than at Adelaide, needing to make 415 runs just to make England bat again, a man down (Harris being unable to bat after his ankle injury), and with more than half the match left to play. Australia got off to a quick start before Hughes was run out off Swann's bowling. Bresnan then took three wickets – Watson lbw, captain Ponting bowled and Hussey caught for a duck – to leave Australia 104/4. Australia finished day 3 on 169/6, 246 runs behind. An 86-run partnership on the fourth morning between Haddin and Siddle delayed the inevitable, but after Swann had Siddle caught by Pietersen at long-on, Bresnan dismissed Hilfenhaus for a pair to seal the match. Australia were bowled out for 258 and England retained the Ashes, winning by an innings and 157 runs to go up 2–1 in the series with one match left to play.\nThe losses at Adelaide and Melbourne also meant that it was the first time that Australia had ever lost two Tests in a home series by an innings.\nFifth Test.\nPrior to the fifth Test match, Ricky Ponting was declared unfit to play due to the injury to his left little finger. Michael Clarke became Australia's 43rd Test captain, while Brad Haddin assumed vice-captain responsibilities. Usman Khawaja made his Test debut in place of Ponting and became the first Pakistani Australian to play for Australia. Spinner Michael Beer also made his Test debut, and became the 10th spinner to feature in the Australian side since Shane Warne's retirement in 2007.\nClarke won the toss and elected to bat in overcast conditions. Watson, Hughes, Khawaja and Clarke all passed 30, but none of the top order reached a half-century. After Hussey was dismissed by all-rounder Collingwood, playing in his final Test having announced his retirement from Test cricket on the fourth morning, Smith and Siddle soon followed to leave Australia at 8/189. However, 53 from Johnson and 34 from Hilfenhaus allowed Australia finish on 280 all out.\nEngland's openers batted positively, with Strauss making 60 off 58 balls before being bowled by Hilfenhaus. Fellow opener Cook continued his excellent form, making his third century and passing 700 runs for the series. After Cook departed for 189, Ian Bell made his first century in Ashes cricket in his 18th Test match against Australia. There was minor controversy when Bell overturned a caught-behind dismissal whilst on 67 – it was overturned because \"Hotspot\" showed no edge on the bat, but Snickometer (which was shown by the broadcaster, but at that time was not used in the referral process) detected an edge. After England passed 500 for the fourth time in the series, wicketkeeper Matt Prior reached his fourth Test hundred, his first against Australia, from just 109 balls – the fastest English Ashes century since Ian Botham in 1981 at Old Trafford. His century meant that six out of England's top seven had made centuries during the series. England reached 644 before being bowled out, their highest ever total in an Ashes Test in Australia.\nNeeding 364 to make England bat again, several Australian batsmen again made starts before getting out. Watson made a brisk 38 before a mix-up left both him and Hughes at the same end for an easy run-out, the third run-out of the series that he was involved in. Clarke scored 41 in his second innings as captain and Haddin made 30, but Tremlett then tempted Haddin into playing a bouncer behind to Prior before clean-bowling Johnson with his next delivery, prompting an extra half hour of play on Day 4. In an eighth-wicket partnership worth 80 runs, Smith made an unbeaten half-century and Siddle made 43; however, after Siddle was removed, Hilfenhaus soon departed for just 7 before Tremlett took the final wicket: Beer bowled, playing on, for 2. Australia's total was 281 and England won by an innings and 83 runs. This was the third time they had won by an innings in the series – the first time a touring side had ever won three Tests by an innings during a single series.\nCook was named Man of the Series after scoring 766 runs for England, and also Man of the Match for his 189 runs in the first innings."

        "title": "Canada national under-20 rugby union team",
        "text": "The Canada under 20 rugby team is the junior national rugby union team from Canada. It replaced the two former age grade teams, the under 19s and under 21s, in 2008. The team competed at the IRB Junior World Championship in 2008 and 2009 but were relegated to the IRB Junior World Rugby Trophy for 2010. The team has yet to make their way back to the top competition.\nHistory.\n2008 and 2009 IRB Junior World Championships.\nIn June 2008 Canada participated in the 2008 IRB Junior World Championships held in Wales. The team competed in Pool C with all of their pool games being played at Rodney Parade in Newport. Canada lost their matches to Australia 81–12 and to England 60–18 but were able to earn a 17–10 win against Fiji which placed them 3rd in their pool. Canada would go on to lose their next two games to Scotland 15–10 and to Italy 33–10. The team ended the tournament in 12th place.\nThe following year Canada competed in the 2009 IRB Junior World Championships hosted by Japan. Canada began pool play with an 86–0 loss to Australia. The team went on to lose their next two pool play matches to Wales 51–15 and to Tonga 36–20. Canada then went into the play off stages and beat Uruguay 29–11 but suffered a 32–22 loss in their final match. Canada's final position was 14th and therefore the team was relegated to the IRB Junior World Rugby Trophy for 2010.\n2010 and 2011 IRB Junior World Rugby Trophy.\nCanada went into the 2010 IRB Junior World Rugby Trophy as one of the favourites to play in the final. However, Canada suffered a 17–15 loss to Russia and another loss to Japan, 38–17. Canada's only win came from a 22–6 defeat of Zimbabwe placing them 3rd in Pool B. The team eventually lost in a dramatic 5th place final 13–11 to Uruguay giving Canada the final position of 6th.\nOn May 24, 2011, under new head coach Mike Shelley, Canada took on the 2011 IRB Junior World Rugby Trophy hosts Georgia to begin pool play. The Canadians were outmatched by the formidable Georgians and lost their opening match 38–9. Canada played their next game four days later against a Japanese team who had previously defeated Zimbabwe four days earlier. The Canadians showed improvement upping their offensive production to 15 points. However, The Japanese proved to be too much for Canada winning the match 30 points to 15. Canada then played their final pool match versus Zimbabwe on June 1, 2011. Canada defeated Zimbabwe 49-23 to record their first Pool B win. Canada would go on to defeat Russia 49–24 in the 5th-place playoff, improving their ranking one spot from last year.\n2012 Junior World Rugby Trophy.\nPrior to the 2012 Junior World Rugby Trophy, Rugby Canada announced an unprecedented series of matches against fellow under-20 national squads from Romania and the United States.\nMarch 2012 saw Canada match up against a formidable Romanian side for two matches the first being played at Shawnigan Lake School. The Romanians had just missed qualification for the 2012 Junior World Rugby Trophy by placing third behind Georgia and Russia in the European qualifiers and so had much to prove. Romania came out firing with physical play, out-muscling the Canadians in the forwards and secured a 30–22 victory. The Canadians and Romanians came together on 10 March for a rematch, and again the Romanian forward pack proved dominant over the Canadians. Romania completed the sweep with a 23–6 defeat over an outworked Canadian squad.\nCanada then met traditional rivals U.S.A. on 23 May 2012 at Shawnigan Lake School for the first of a two-match series. Both squads contained players still vying for spots on their respective nation's final roster for the 2012 IRB Junior World Rugby Trophy. The game proved to be a back-and-forth affair as the Canadians and Americans traded scores. At the end of the first half, the Canadians led the Junior All-Americans by a score of 15–8. Early substitutions at the beginning of the second half proved fruitful for the United States as they scored off a quick tap from an American front row reserve. Quickly after the United States struck again off a counter-attack, taking an important 20–15 lead. Canada would hit back soon after with a try from replacement centre Michael Fuailefau which was well converted by Conor McCann; however, the Americans would find time to score one more try, finishing the match with a 27–22 victory. The teams would meet three days later. Canada would come out with 21 unanswered points before the United States completed the comeback and picked up a 34–28 win.\nCanada would play one more preparation game against a touring university side from Scotland, St. Andrews University. The Scottish university side proved to be a mismatch with the Canadian under-20s coming out 118-0 winners. Canada's preparation would conclude with a 1–4 record.\nCanada's pre-tournament matches would prove prophetic as Canada struggled throughout, losing their first game 31–17 at the hands of a very physical Georgia side. Four days later, on 22 June 2012, the young Canadians would once again go down in defeat, this time losing to a rising Japan team, 38–35. Canada would end pool play on a positive note, picking up a 66–45 win in a high-scoring affair against Zimbabwe. The fifth-place decider saw the Canadian team face a spirited Chile side. Once again the Canadian defense was lacking, and the Chileans would take a 20-point lead in the second half of the match. Canada came back with a series of tries but ultimately came up short, the game finishing 43–31 in the Chileans' favour. With the loss to Chile, Canada finished 6th in the tournament. Taylor Paris would finish the tournament with 5 tries, the second most in the tournament.\n2013–2015 Junior World Rugby Trophy.\nDuring this period, the Canadian junior team saw highs and lows which included two second-place finishes in the 2013 and 2015 Junior World Rugby Trophies and a dismal seventh-place finish in the 2014 edition of the tournament. Canada would go a perfect 3–0 in pool play in 2013, beating out formidable opponents in Tonga, Japan, and Uruguay. The team would eventually fall heavily, 45–23, in the final to a very strong Italian side. This second-place finish, however, would be Canada's best result in the second-tier tournament.\nUnable to match their successes of the 2014 tournament, the 2014 Junior World Rugby Trophy saw Canada finish with two losses and a tie against Uruguay. They finished the tournament on a high note, defeating hosts Hong Kong 33–30 to finish seventh overall. Following the tournament Mike Shelley was relieved of his head coaching duties of the Canada U20 team.\nWith a brand-new head coach in former Canadian national player, Jeff Williams, Canada seemed revitalized, going through pool play of the 2015 tournament with a 3–0 record, knocking off Namibia, Hong Kong, and a close win against Tonga. However, Canada would yet again miss out on promotion to the Junior World Rugby Championship as the team were unable to get by a powerful Georgian side. Canada lost the final match 49–24.\nResults and statistics.\nOverall.\nCanadian U-20 rugby record against other U-20 national teams.\nPersonnel.\nCurrent squad.\nCanada's squad for the 2023 World Rugby Under 20 Trophy North American Qualifier two-match series in Spartanburg, South Carolina."

Scotland had pushed a scrum over the English try-line, and Buchanan had fallen on the ball.\nThis was converted by William Cross, which created the score (crucially because it was goals that counted, not tries). The English argued that the try should not stand, but it was awarded by the umpire Dr Hely Hutchinson Almond (also a Scot - the umpires were two on the field: one from each side)\nAlmond made a questionable justification of his decision:\nAccording to one of the English players:\nAccording to confirmed records, Buchanan was the first Scotland player born, in January, 1847, and was twenty four years and two months old when capped.\nReferee career.\nBuchanan became an international referee.

Of the Scottish score, one of the English players wrote: \"after a maul, just outside the English goal-line the umpires ordered the ball to be put down in the scrummage five yards outside the line. It was taken was out accordingly, but, instead of putting it down, the Scottish forwards drove the entire scrummage into goal, and then grounded the ball and claimed a try. This, though illegal according to English laws, was allowed by the umpires and the goal was kicked by Cross.\"\nAt the time, conversions and goals, not tries produced a score, so in fact Cross, not Buchanan was the first to put points on the board. In fact, this was the only score in the match.\nCross rounded off the game with a second try, ninety seconds before the final whistle, when with their forwards running riot, J.W. Arthur knocked on from a line-out and the ball looped over the English defenders, with the quick thinking Cross picking it up for Scotland's second try.\nHe played one more international in 1872.\nReferee career.\nAfter his international playing career was over, Cross became Scotland's second international rugby referee when he officiated an early encounter between Scotland and England. This was his only international game as a referee.\nHe refereed the 1882 inter-city match between Glasgow District and Edinburgh District.\nAdministrative career.\nCross took up a role within the Scottish Rugby Union and he continued promoting Scottish rugby, becoming President of the Scottish Rugby Union for the 1882–83 season.\nFamily.\nHis brother Malcolm Cross gained nine caps for Scotland."

        "text": "The men's 1500 metres in short track speed skating at the 2010 Winter Olympics took place on February 13 at the Pacific Coliseum. Heats took place at 5:00 PM PST, while the semifinals took place at 6:18 PM PST and the final event one hour later at 7:18 PM PST.\nPreview.\nGoing into the competition, speculation about possible winners focused on the strong South Korean contingent and on American skater Apolo Ohno. The South Korean team dominated short track speed skating at the 2006 Winter Olympics, winning six gold, three silver, and two bronze medals in the eight events. Their team at the 2010 games also included a number of skaters who were reigning world champions. Ohno received significant media attention both because of previous successes at the 2002 Winter Olympics and 2006 Games and because he was in a position to break two records, the most medals won by a short track speed skater, and the most medals won by any winter Olympian from the United States.\nQualifying heats.\nFollowing the semifinal round, seven skaters qualified for the final medal round: Lee Jung-su, Lee Ho-suk and Sung Si-bak of South Korea, Apolo Ohno and J. R. Celski of the United States, Liang Wenhao of China, and Olivier Jean of Canada. Jean actually placed seventh in his semifinal heat, but advanced to the medal race after judges ruled that he had been interfered with during the race.\nFinal heat and results.\nThe South Korean skaters and Ohno jostled for the lead during much of the race, switching lead positions multiple times. Entering the final lap, the three South Koreans had passed Ohno and were in a position to sweep the medals in the event. However, at the entrance of the last corner on the final lap, Lee Ho-suk made a last-minute daring inside pass on Sung Si-bak, only to have his blade collide with Si-bak to cause both skaters to fall and slam into the barriers. This allowed Ohno and his fellow American skater J. R. Celski to move into second and third positions behind the eventual winner, Lee Jung-su. Lee Ho-suk was later disqualified by judges for causing the crash, and Sung Si-bak took fifth place.\nFollowing the race, gold medalist Lee Jung-su told the media that he did not feel good about his win because of his teammates' misfortune. He credited his win to a decision to start the race in the front of the pack, which was not his usual technique. With his second-place finish and his sixth medal, Ohno became the most medaled short track speed skater in Olympic history, and tied Bonnie Blair's record as the most medaled American winter Olympian. Celski, who was skating after recovering from an accident the previous fall in which a skate's blade had sliced into his leg, earned his first medal.\nHaralds Silovs became the first athlete in Olympic history to participate in both short track and long track (5000 m) speed skating, and the first to compete in two different disciplines on the same day. He competed in the 5000 m and then raced across town to the 1500 m event."

The highest-scoring run determined whether or not the competitor continued to the next round (or medaled, in the final round). In each round (except for the first run of the qualifying round) the order of performance was based on the inverse order of scoring (i.e., the competitor with the lowest score went first and so forth with the highest-scoring competitor going last).\nThe first round was the qualifying round, with 40 snowboarders divided into two heats. The top nine scorers from each heat advanced; the top three scorers went straight to the final round while the fourth- through ninth-place scorers went to a semifinal round.\nThe semifinal round consisted of twelve snowboarders. The top six from that group joined the six top scorers from the qualifying round for the finals.\nIn the final round, Shaun White had already wrapped up the gold medal performance with his first run (none of the other competitors' second-run scores exceeded White's 46.8 score), but performed his second run anyway, successfully completing a double McTwist 1260 and improving on his initial score.\nIt is currently the only Olympic halfpipe final to take place at night."

        "title": "Swimming at the 1972 Summer Olympics – Men's 100 metre freestyle",
        "text": "The men's 100 metre freestyle event at the 1972 Olympic Games took place between September 2 and 3. There were 48 competitors from 29 nations. Nations had been limited to three swimmers each since the 1924 Games (except in 1960, when the limit was two). The event was won by Mark Spitz of the United States, his then-record sixth gold medal in a single Games (he would add a seventh in the medley relay, for a record that stood until Michael Phelps won eight in 2008). It was the ninth victory in the event for an American, most of any nation. Jerry Heidenreich, also of the United States, took silver. Soviet swimmer Vladimir Bure (father of future hockey hall of famer Pavel Bure) earned bronze, the nation's first medal in the men's 100 metre freestyle.\nBackground.\nThis was the 16th appearance of the men's 100 metre freestyle. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.\nThree of the eight finalists from the 1968 Games returned: gold medalist Michael Wenden of Australia, bronze medalist Mark Spitz of the United States, and sixth-place finisher Georgijs Kuļikovs of the Soviet Union. Spitz had already won five gold medals in 1972, matching the record, and had two events left: the 100 metre freestyle and the medley relay. The American team was not expected to have any difficulty with the relay, so this event was the last one in which there was any substantial drama as to whether Spitz could take 7 gold medals in Munich. Spitz, who had set the world record at the U.S. trials, was favored, though fellow American Jerry Heidenreich was a serious contender, as were Wenden and the Soviet team.\nCambodia (then Khmer Republic), Kuwait, and New Zealand each made their debut in the event; East Germany competed separately for the first time. The United States made its 16th appearance, having competed at each edition of the event to date.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a three-round (heats, semifinals, final) format. The advancement rule mostly followed the format introduced in 1952, though the number of semifinals was reduced from 3 to 2 and qualification for the final was done via place with wild cards in the semifinals. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nA swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. There were 7 heats scheduled, with 7 or 8 swimmers each. Due to withdrawals, some heats had as few as 6 swimmers. The top 16 swimmers advanced to the semifinals.\nThere were 2 semifinals of 8 swimmers each. The top 3 swimmers in each semifinal as well as the next 2 fastest swimmers advanced to the final.\nThis swimming event used freestyle swimming, which means that the method of the stroke is not regulated (unlike backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events). Nearly all swimmers use the front crawl or a variant of that stroke. Because an Olympic size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of two lengths of the pool.\nFor the first time at the Olympics, times were reported to the hundredths of a second.\nRecords.\nThese were the standing world and Olympic records (in seconds) prior to the 1972 Summer Olympics.\nMark Spitz broke the world record in the final, swimming in 51.22 seconds. This also set a new record for most gold medals in a single Olympics, with six.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe 16 fastest swimmers from seven heats advanced to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nThe top three swimmers in each semifinal and the next two fastest overall advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nSpitz started fast, surprising Heidenreich. Heidenreich gave chase and closed during the final stretch, but was unable to catch Spitz."

The event was won by Mark Spitz of the United States, the nation's second victory in the event (68 years, but only two appearances of the event, apart). It was the third gold medal for Spitz in 1972, halfway to his goal of six (he would ultimately finish the Games with seven). His teammate Steve Genter took silver, with Werner Lampe of West Germany earning bronze. Defending champion Michael Wenden of Australia finished fourth.\nBackground.\nThis was the fourth appearance of the 200 metre freestyle event. It was first contested in 1900. It would be contested a second time, though at 220 yards, in 1904. After that, the event did not return until 1968; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games.\nTwo of the 8 finalists from the 1968 Games returned: gold medalist Michael Wenden of Australia and fourth-place finisher Ralph Hutton of Canada. Mark Spitz was the world record holder and a heavy favourite coming into the Games, aiming for at least six gold medals. He had won the 200 fly and 4x100 free relay the day before this event. His biggest challenger was countryman Steve Genter, though Genter was hampered by pneumothorax while in Munich.\nBrazil, Cambodia (then Khmer Republic), East Germany, Egypt, Iceland, Kuwait, Mexico, New Zealand, Romania, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia each made their debut in the event. Australia and the United States made their fourth appearance each, the only two nations to have competed in all prior editions of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a two-round (heats, final) format. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. There were 7 heats of between 5 and 8 swimmers each. The top 8 swimmers advanced to the final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used freestyle swimming, which means that the method of the stroke is not regulated (unlike backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events). Nearly all swimmers use the front crawl or a variant of that stroke. Because an Olympic-size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nThe standing world and Olympic records prior to this competition were as follows. Clark's Olympic record was set as the first leg in the 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay final.\nMark Spitz beat his own world record in the final, swimming 1:52.78.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe 8 fastest swimmers from the seven heats, without regard to place in heat, advanced to final.\nFinal.\nSpitz led at the first turn, followed by Bure. Genter, still recovering from his collapsed lung, took the lead at the halfway mark by .13 seconds (54.93 to 55.06 for Spitz). Genter held the lead through the final turn at 150 metres. Wenden, the defending champion, worked his way up to third by that mark. Spitz finished strong to win by a full second over Genter. Lampe also finished strong, beating Wenden for bronze."

        "title": "Pub golf",
        "text": "Pub golf or bar golf is a recreational drinking game involving a selection of either nine or eighteen pubs (Public House/Bar), creating a \"course\" to be played by two or more people. It is essentially a pub crawl made into a game. Unlike the actual game of golf, pub golf involves no ball or fairway.\nRules.\nLike the game of golf, pub golf has the standard 9 or 18 different \"holes\", wherein each bar is considered a \"hole\". The bars to be visited during the game are predetermined and numbered. These numbers determine the order in which each bar will be visited. Prior to playing the game, a par number (ranging from 1 to 5) also needs to be determined for each bar. E.g. Hole \"5\" (at Pub #5)- Par 4= One pint of beer.\nThe par number represents how many drinks/sips/gulps it should take to complete the drink assigned. Therefore, in the example given, at hole 5, if the pint of beer is completed in 4 drinks, the person drinking that pint is awarded a par. However many drinks it takes to complete the assigned drink should be recorded on a scorecard. (Thus, 5 drinks @ Hole 5= +1 to your score).\nThe drinks assigned to the different \"holes\" (pubs) should vary, and should be reasonable when taking into account the par number (number of gulps it takes to finish). A simple shot, for example, should suffice for a par one.\nA time limit for each hole must also be determined before the game is played. Thirty minutes is generally sufficient, but it can vary depending on your party size and focus.\nThere are many different variations of pub golf played, and some games add hazards to the course. E.g. Certain holes can be assigned as having a water hazard. This means that the restroom cannot be used while playing that hole, or else a penalty stroke is given.\nScoring.\nScores are kept on individual score cards, and each person keeps track of how many drinks/sips/gulps taken to finish the assigned drink for that hole. If the number of drinks/sips/gulps is the same as the par number, then that participant receives a par for that hole. Assigned drinks can be finished with fewer or more drinks/sips/gulps than the par number assigned, and so a contestant will receive their hole score as such. The goal is similar to golf in that it is to end the game with the lowest score. Prizes are often awarded in the end as an incentive to strive for a lower score.\nIn the event of a tie, the winner shall be determined by an arm wrestle to be conducted on the footpath outside the final pub. \nOften the individual who comes last in pub golf is expected to do a forfeit. This makes the game more intense as it creates drama. Participants obviously don't want to forfeit as it is often embarrassing. One of the most popular forfeits is the person that finishes in last place has to go in their pub golf costume to a public place, such as universities or a place of work."

        "title": "2003 Rugby World Cup",
        "text": "The 2003 Rugby World Cup was the fifth Rugby World Cup and was won by England. Originally planned to be co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand, all games were shifted to Australia following a contractual dispute over ground signage rights between the New Zealand Rugby Union and Rugby World Cup Limited. The pre-event favourites were England, regarded by many at the time as the best team in the world. New Zealand, France, South Africa and defending champions Australia were also expected to make strong showings, with New Zealand being second favourites after victory in the southern-hemisphere Tri-Nations championship.\nThe tournament began with host nation Australia defeating Argentina 24–8 at Stadium Australia in Sydney. Australia went on to defeat New Zealand 22–10 in the semi-final, to play England in the final. Along with a try to Jason Robinson, Jonny Wilkinson kicked four penalties and then a drop-goal in extra time to win the game 20–17 for England, who became the first northern hemisphere team to win the Webb Ellis Cup.\nQualifying.\nThe following 20 teams, shown by region, qualified for the 2003 Rugby World Cup. Of the 20 teams, eight of those places were automatically filled by the teams that reached the quarter-final stages in 1999, including hosts and world champions Australia and did not have to play any qualification matches. A record 81 nations from five continents were involved in the qualification process designed to fill the remaining 12 spots, which began on 23 September 2000.\nHost.\nHosting rights to the tournament were initially awarded to both Australia and New Zealand; Australia would serve as the primary host, staging 25 of the 48 matches, while the other 23 would be played in New Zealand. Concerns were expressed in January 2001 that Australia might have been stripped of hosting rights after the International Rugby Board (IRB) removed official status from the 2001 Brisbane Sevens in response to the Australian government denying entry visas to the Fiji team; despite this, the IRB confirmed that Australia was still confirmed as host nation.\nIn March 2002, the Australian Rugby Union withdrew its offer to allow New Zealand to co-host the tournament after New Zealand Rugby failed to return the sub-host agreement by the deadline of 04:00 GMT on 8 March 2002. The New Zealand governing body had returned the documents, but with substantial changes relating to signage inside stadiums. New Zealand Rugby had intended for the annual National Provincial Championship to take place during the World Cup, and insisted on being able to honour its agreement with local sponsors, but this was not acceptable to the IRB. The ARU was then given 21 days to come up with alternative arrangements. Australia's new plans were ratified at an IRB meeting on 18 April 2003, confirming them as sole hosts of the tournament. The IRB was criticised from some quarters for its decision to strip New Zealand of the World Cup, and speaking to \"BBC Sport\", former New Zealand number 8 Zinzan Brooke called on his former team to threaten a boycott of tournament. New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said the IRB and the ARU had not given enough time to find a solution; however, the head of the ARU, John O'Neill, said he feared Australia could lose the World Cup entirely as a result of the disagreement.\nVenues.\nThe overall stadium capacity was 421,311 across 11 venues. This was a reduction from the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales (with games also held in England, France, Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland) which had a total capacity of 654,677 across 18 venues.\nThe Adelaide Oval underwent a AU$20 million redevelopment for the 2003 Rugby World Cup, financed entirely by the South Australian Cricket Association, with two new grandstands built adjacent to the Victor Richardson Gates. Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane (formerly Lang Park) was a new A$280 million venue designed specifically for rugby league, rugby union and soccer, and was opened just prior to the start of the 2003 World Cup with a capacity of 52,500, some 12,000 more than the old Lang Park could hold. The Central Coast Stadium was also a newly built rectangular venue built for union, league and soccer. It was built on the site of the old Grahame Park ground and was opened in February 2000 at a cost of A$30 million.\nThe Sydney Football Stadium was one of two venues in Sydney that were used for football during the 2000 Olympic Games. The other venue in Sydney was Stadium Australia, which was the centrepiece of the 2000 Olympic Games. It was built as the main stadium of the 2000 Olympics at a cost of $690 million and with a capacity of 83,500 was the biggest stadium used in the 2003 World Cup (the stadium had an original capacity of 110,000 before undergoing a post-Olympics redevelopment from 2001 to 2003). The only stadium with a retractable roof used was the Docklands Stadium in Melbourne. Although the Docklands Stadium has movable seating which brings four sections of the lower bowl forward by 18 metres to create a more rectangular surround for the pitch, this was not used during the World Cup as it reduces the seating capacity of the stadium by approximately 3,500.\nPools and format.\nFollowing criticism of the complex format used in the 1999 Rugby World Cup a new simpler format was introduced and the twenty teams were divided into four pools of five nations, with the top two in each pool moving on to the knock-out quarter-final stage. With forty matches to be played in the pool stage on top of the knock-out matches would make the event the largest Rugby World Cup tournament to be played to date. For the first time, a bonus point system was implemented in pool play. This system is identical to that long used in Southern Hemisphere tournaments, and was soon adopted in most European competitions (though not in the Six Nations until 2017):\nA total of 48 matches (40 pool stage and eight knock-out) were played throughout the tournament over 42 days from 10 October to 22 November 2003.\nSummary.\nPool stage.\nThe Australian media criticised the competition early in the tournament as the smaller nations were crushed by the rugby superpowers by 60 points or more, in particular a 142–0 victory by the host nation over Namibia, the largest winning margin in Rugby World Cup history. However, some of these smaller, third-tier nations, such as Japan, acquitted themselves well in their opening matches. The South Pacific island countries of Fiji, Tonga and Samoa were reported as being handicapped by several of their foreign-based key players being warned by their clubs that their contracts would not be renewed if they played in the competition.\nThe pool stage of the competition played out largely as expected, with some tension as to whether some of the \"developing\" nations would overtake some of the weaker major countries for the second quarter-final qualification place in each pool – in Pool A, Argentina lost to Ireland by only one point, when a victory would have carried them into the quarter-finals in Ireland's place; in Pool B, Fiji narrowly missed out on a quarter-final berth, having led Scotland 20–15 with five minutes to go in their deciding match, only for a yellow card to lock Apenisa Naevo to allow Scotland to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat with a late converted try; in Pool D, Italy, despite missing the knockout stage, put up a good performance with two victories. In Pool C, Samoa gave England a fright with an adventurous approach that allowed them to take an early lead, but England overcame the early deficit and eventually won. This match was marked by controversy, as England technically fielded 16 players for 30 seconds during the game when Dan Luger came onto the pitch in substitution for Mike Tindall, who was receiving treatment for an injury but still on the pitch. England were fined £10,000 as a result.\nThe big clashes ran mainly to form. South Africa came through the pool in second place, after they lost to England, which meant a quarter-final against New Zealand. Australia, however, only beat Ireland by one point to top their pool, while Wales pushed the All Blacks to the wire in arguably the most entertaining game of the entire tournament; adopting a hyper-attacking style of play, they led 37–33 with just 20 minutes left, but New Zealand eventually proved too much in the 12-try thriller. France meanwhile routed Scotland to set up a quarter-final against Ireland.\nKnockout stage.\nThe quarter-final stage produced the widely predicted set of semi-finalists, although England again made heavy weather of defeating a resurgent Wales. England were widely rated the world's best team, but they struggled, at least in the first half, against a Welsh side full of belief after their game against New Zealand. However, spurred into action after the tactical substitution of Catt for Luger and by a Will Greenwood try, set up by a remarkable run by Jason Robinson from inside his own half, England pulled away in the second half, until a late Welsh try gave the scoreline the respectability that their first-half performance had deserved. France destroyed an Irish side who had gone into the match hopeful of a win, scoring 31 early points to put the game out of reach. In the other quarter-finals, a disappointing South Africa fell to a clinical New Zealand and Australia comprehensively defeated the Scots.\nThe first semi-final produced the first significant upset of the tournament, when Australia defeated the fancied New Zealand to become the first defending champions to reach the following championship final. Unfortunately, it was the last match for Australian star Ben Darwin, who badly injured his neck in a scrum. Although Darwin never played rugby again, the actions of Kees Meeuws – who immediately stopped exerting pressure when he heard the call \"neck neck neck\" – may well have saved his opponent's life and certainly prevented further injury. The match was decided by a Stirling Mortlock interception try, after a loose pass from highly rated All Blacks fly-half Carlos Spencer, and the excellent kicking of inside-centre Elton Flatley. George Gregan taunted his opponents in defeat with the comment, \"Four more years boys, four more years\".\nThe second semi-final saw France face England. The boot of Jonny Wilkinson was the difference between the two sides, with England coming out victors in torrential rain: although France scored the game's only try after an early English line-out error, they never seriously threatened the English line otherwise. With handling and place-kicking being so difficult in the wet and windy conditions (Wilkinson missed three kicks at goal, and Michalak missed four), England's superior forward pressure and territorial control forced France to concede a slew of penalties, of which Wilkinson kicked five, also adding three drop goals (two off his less-favoured right boot) - a remarkable display considering that the swirling winds made accurate kicking as difficult as the rain and mud made passing and running. French ill-discipline also cost them dear, with winger Christophe Dominici and flanker Serge Betsen both receiving yellow-cards for foul play: the former for a cynical trip on Jason Robinson, the latter for a late tackle on Wilkinson.\nNew Zealand played France in the third-place playoff, and New Zealand avenged their shock defeat to France in the semi-finals at the 1999 World Cup, running in 6 tries in a 40-13 demolition. Mils Muliaina and Doug Howlett scored a try a-piece, finishing as the tournament's joint-leading try-scorers with 7 tries.\nFinal.\nThe final between Australia and England was played at Sydney's Stadium Australia in front of a crowd of 82,957, and was refereed by veteran South African official André Watson, in so doing becoming the first, and so far only, referee to officiate two Rugby World Cup finals. Australia opened the scoring after they decided to run a penalty instead of kicking for touch. Lote Tuqiri beat England's right wing, Jason Robinson, to a high cross-field kick and went over for the first try, but Elton Flatley was not able to add the conversion.\nThe rest of the half was a tight affair, with England edging in front from applying pressure and Jonny Wilkinson's boot put them up to a 9–5 lead after Australian indiscipline gave away several penalties, but were unable to capitalise on their territory. Towards the end of the first half, England stretched their lead further. Lawrence Dallaglio made a break and popped the ball inside to Jonny Wilkinson, who drew the defence before putting Robinson away in the corner for a try. The conversion was missed, but England went in at half time leading by 14–5.\nIn the second half Australia tightened their discipline, and solid play forced mistakes from England. The game swung from end to end, with both sides having try-scoring opportunities, but neither able to take them. Australia managed to get points on the board and Elton Flatley scored two penalties to make the score 14–11 to England. In the 79th minute, Australia were putting pressure on England in their half, and Australia were awarded a penalty right before full-time, with the potential to tie the scores. Flatley converted it to make the score 14–14 and take the game into an additional 20 minutes' extra time.\nEngland opened the scoring in extra time with another Wilkinson penalty, but with two and a half minutes of extra time remaining Australia were awarded another penalty, which Flatley kicked successfully. With 20 seconds left before sudden death, Wilkinson scored a drop goal to win the match and with it the world championship.\nPost-final.\nAfter the final, Australian Prime Minister John Howard was widely criticised for his behaviour during the presentation ceremony. The offhand manner in which he presented the Webb Ellis Cup to the England captain was seen by many as a graceless piece of bad sportsmanship not befitting such a climactic sporting spectacle.\nThree days after the final, the World Cup winning England team landed at Heathrow Airport in the early hours of the morning, emerging from their plane to a huge reception, despite the time. On 8 December, a national day of celebration took place in the form of a massive victory parade in the streets of London.\nPool stage.\nPool A.\n&lt;section begin=\"PoolATable\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"PoolATable\" /&gt;\n\"Largest winning margin in Rugby World Cup history.\"\nPool B.\n&lt;section begin=\"PoolBTable\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"PoolBTable\" /&gt;\n\"Andy Miller's drop goal, at 52 metres, remains the longest in Rugby World Cup history.\"\nPool C.\n&lt;section begin=\"PoolCTable\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"PoolCTable\" /&gt;\nPool D.\n&lt;section begin=\"PoolDTable\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"PoolDTable\" /&gt;\nStatistics.\nThe tournament's top point scorer was England's Jonny Wilkinson, who scored 113 points.

        "text": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1919 was the first cricket season after a four-year break from first class cricket during World War I. The English club Derbyshire had been playing for forty-eight years with their twenty first season in the County Championship being notable that they won three matches in the County Championship to come ninth.\n1919 season.\nAfter the First World War, county cricket resumed in 1919 but everyone connected with the game had to put in much effort to create a very basic competition. Matches were restricted to two days to begin with, but the experiment was not repeated. Derbyshire played 14 matches in the County Championship and one against the Australian Imperial Forces. Derbyshire struggled to create a team, drawing in several youngsters, and also calling upon players who had last represented the club years previously. As a result, they managed three wins in the County Championship and four matches altogether - their particular accomplishment was to defeat the Australian Imperial Forces XI, Derbyshire being the only county side to do so.\nRichard Baggallay had been the last captain before the war and he led the team in the resumption of the game although he only played in three matches. John Chapman was the most frequent substitute. Leonard Oliver was top scorer and Billy Bestwick took most wickets with 89. Bestwick had made his debut for Derbyshire in 1898; he had not played for them since 1909 and had a reputation for unreliability on account of taste for beer. He was brought back into the team in 1919 at the age of 43, with Arthur Morton as his minder. Although it was thought he would be past first-class cricket his capability surprised everybody. The 36 runs victory over the Australians was achieved without Bestwick, who, was making his first appearance for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's. James Horsley managed a hat-trick, and with Arthur Morton shared nineteen wickets in the two Australian innings. George Beet stepped in behind the stumps, bridging the gap between the stalwarts Joe Humphries and Harry Elliott.\nThe season marked the beginning of Guy Jackson's long association with the club. Other new players included the Hill-Woods - Basil and Wilfred, Arthur Severn, Louis Flint, Geoffrey Bell and William Malthouse. In addition George Ratcliffe made his single appearance for Derbyshire against the Australians, and John Dunlop Southern made the first of his occasional appearances, also against the Australians.\nStatistics.\nWicket Keeper.\nG Beet Catches 25, Stumping 7"

        "text": "The 1889 World Series was an end-of-the-year baseball playoff series between the National League champion New York Giants and the American Association champion Brooklyn Bridegrooms (later known as the Dodgers).\nThis Series was part of the pre-modern-era World Series, an annual competition between the champions of the National League and the American Association. The Giants won this best-of-11-games series, 6 games to 3. The 1889 Series was the first involving solely New York City area clubs, and was part of the continuum of a long-standing rivalry that developed between the clubs in New York, particularly the Giants and the Dodgers. Brooklyn was then a separate city from New York; Brooklyn (and the other three boroughs) would merge with New York City in 1898. (see Timeline of New York City)\nDespite this Series setback, the Brooklyn team would come back strong in 1890. The club transferred to the National League, and with the Giants suffering raids by the Players' League, would win the league championship; it was the first major league club to win consecutive pennants in two different leagues.\nWorld Series summary.\nThe New York Giants defeated the Brooklyn Bridegrooms in the 1889 World Series, 6 games to 3.\nOn October 17, the two clubs owners, John B. Day of the New York club and Charles H. Byrne of the Brooklyn club, met to arrange a post-season series. They agreed that the Series would end when one club had won six games. The Series commenced the next day, and continued through October 29, when the Giants won their sixth game, ending the Series.\nAttendance was good for the first two games, at the Polo Grounds and Washington Park, respectively, but the weather turned cold and rainy, and the remainder of the Series was sparsely attended.\nGame 1 saw a Seventh-inning stretch after somebody yelled \"Stretch for luck.\""

        "text": "The 1890 World Series was an end-of-the-year baseball playoff series between the National League champion Brooklyn Bridegrooms (later known as the Dodgers) and the American Association champion Louisville Colonels.\nThis Series was part of the pre-modern-era World Series, an annual competition between the champions of the National League and the American Association. The best-of-7 games Series ended without resolution. Each club won 3 games, with 1 game ending in a tie.\nAfter losing the 1889 World Series to their \"cross-town\" rivals, the New York Giants (Brooklyn was actually a separate city until 1898), the Bridegrooms came back strong and won the National League pennant in 1890, the first major league club to win consecutive pennants in two different leagues (the only other being the Boston Reds (1890–91)).\nThe major league world was in turmoil in 1890, as many of the best players had jumped to an outlaw organization called the Players' League. Although the Brotherhood only lasted the one season, it had a detrimental financial effect on the other two leagues, especially the Association.\nAlthough the Boston Reds of the Players' League were probably the best team in the majors, and had floated the idea of a three-way World Series, the established leagues ignored them and made arrangements for the usual NL-AA contest, this time to be a conventional best-4-of-7 Series.\nThe games were held at the Bridegrooms' home field, Washington Park, and the Colonels' home field, Eclipse Park. The first four were played in Louisville (including a tie in Game 3), and the remainder of the Series was scheduled for Brooklyn.\nThe Series commenced on October 17 and concluded on October 28. The weather had become progressively worse as the Series wore on, and prior to Game 7, the two managers agreed that this would be the final game, and if Louisville won the game to square the Series at 3–3–1 (which they did), that there would be a deciding championship game the following spring.\nUnfortunately for that plan, the championship game was never held. Disputes arose between the National League and the American Association during the winter about the redistribution of players following the dissolution of the Players' League. The Association ended its relationship with the League before the spring of 1891, so the anticipated championship game was canceled, and no World Series was held in 1891. The 1891 pennant winners would be the Boston Beaneaters of the NL and the Boston Reds of the AA, who had joined the Association from the Players' League. This would turn out to be the only time two Boston clubs would win their respective league championships. It would also turn out to be the second (and last) time that a club won pennants in consecutive years in different leagues.\nFollowing the 1891 season, the Association folded, and four clubs were brought into the League. The League would attempt a championships series during the 1890s called the Temple Cup Series, which would prove to be better organized and better attended than the NL-AA contests, and would help pave the way to the modern World Series that would begin in 1903."

        "title": "Boxing on NBC",
        "text": "Boxing on NBC is the de facto title for NBC Sports' boxing television coverage.\nHistory.\nOn July 2, 1921, NBC's future owner RCA and its Hoboken, New Jersey, radio station WJY presented live coverage of the Jack Dempsey vs. Georges Carpentier heavyweight title fight. In the first major sporting event to be broadcast to a regional audience, ringside announcer J. Andrew White called Dempsey's fourth-round knockout victory.\nOn June 1, 1939, NBC (or technically, WNBT, which would eventually becoming NBC's flagship affiliate, WNBC) became the first American television network to broadcast a boxing match. Emanating from Yankee Stadium in New York City, Bill Stern provided the blow-by-blow commentary for the fight between Lou Nova and Max Baer.\n\"Gillette Cavalcade of Sports\".\nThe earliest incarnation of NBC's boxing telecasts could be traced back to 1944. Although technically, an anthology program, the \"Cavalcade of Sports\" was best known for Friday night boxing (from Madison Square Garden) on NBC from 1944 through 1960, and (after NBC decided against featuring boxing due to sensitivity over criminal allegations in the sport) then for several more years on ABC. When \"Cavalcade of Sports\" closed up shop on June 24, 1960, after a 14-year period, it marked the longest continuous run of any boxing program in television history.\nOn the premiere episode of \"Cavalcade of Sports\" (airing on September 29, 1944), NBC broadcast a 15-round bout between Willie Pep and Chalky Wright.\nOn June 19, 1946, at Yankee Stadium, Joe Louis defeated Billy Conn in the first televised World Heavyweight Championship bout ever. 146,000 people watched it on TV, also setting a record for the most seen world heavyweight bout in history. One year later on NBC on December 5, Joe Louis defeated Jersey Joe Walcott to retain the world heavyweight title.\nOn February 14, 1951, Sugar Ray Robinson defeated Jake LaMotta in 13 rounds for the world middleweight title.\nOn the March 26, 1954, edition of \"Gillette Cavalcade of Sports\" from New York City's Madison Square Garden, Al Andrews and Gustav Scholz fought in NBC's first color transmission of a sporting event.\n\"Boxing from St. Nicholas Arena\".\nAnother boxing program called \"Boxing from St. Nicholas Arena\" aired on NBC during the same period (more specifically, from 1946 to 1948) as the \"Cavalcade of Sports\".\n\"Sportsworld\" and partnership with Telemundo.\nOn the July 14, 1979, edition of \"NBC SportsWorld\", NBC aired an eight round long exhibition match from Denver's Mile High Stadium between former Broncos defensive lineman Lyle Alzado and Muhammad Ali. Sam Nover provided the blow-by-blow commentary with Dick Schaap reporting. Two years later on June 25, \"NBC SportsWorld\" aired Sugar Ray Leonard's victory in the ninth round against Ayub Kalule to become the WBA World Light Middleweight champion. Marv Albert and Ferdie Pacheco called the action from Houston's Astrodome.\nMichael Weisman became the executive producer of NBC Sports in 1982. In boxing, Weisman introduced the use of the three minute clock on-screen to mark how much time remained in a round and placed microphones in the boxers' corners between rounds.\nOn May 20, 1985, NBC broadcast in prime time the IBF Heavyweight Championship of the World bout between Larry Holmes and Carl Williams. In what would become NBC's final prime time boxing broadcast for 30 years, Dick Enberg hosted while Marv Albert provided blow-by-blow coverage with analyst Ferdie Pacheco.\nIn 2003, NBC picked up a package of three bouts from the promotional group Main Events, which aired on May 3, 10 and 17, 2003. All three matches were also aired in Spanish by NBC's sister network Telemundo. It marked the first time that NBC broadcast professional boxing since 1992, when \"Sportsworld\" ended its run after 14 years. The following year, NBC and Telemundo renewed the partnership with a series of five Saturday cards beginning April 17.\nNBCSN's \"Fight Night\".\nBeginning in 2006, when the NBCSN was known as Versus, they began airing matches from Bob Arum's Top Rank group. Nick Charles was one of the announcers. In 2010, Versus broadcast the World Series of Boxing.\nNBCSN's \"Fight Night\" series premiered on January 21, 2012, from 2300 Arena in Philadelphia with Kenny Rice and trainer Freddie Roach on the call and Chris Mannix of \"Sports Illustrated\" serving as reporter and researcher.\nPremier Boxing Champions.\nIn January 2015, NBC announced that Al Michaels would host ringside along with blow-by-blow man Marv Albert and color commentator Sugar Ray Leonard for the \"PBC on NBC\" Saturday night bouts. In partnership with Haymon Boxing, NBC would televise 20 \"PBC on NBC\" events (beginning on March 7), including five to be shown in prime time on Saturday nights.\nIn its review of the inaugural \"Premier Boxing Champions\" event on NBC, \"Bad Left Hook\" praised the event's on-air production style for feeling more like a \"modern\", \"true mainstream sports show\" than the boxing events of HBO and Showtime, along with the performance of Al Michaels, Steve Smoger, and BJ Flores. The performance of Marv Albert was panned, noting that he \"[missed] a lot of the action\", along with Steve Farhood's lack of contributions beyond scoring the fights. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack was also criticized for being \"generic\" and \"[robbing] fighters of their own personalities.\" \"Bleacher Report\" was similarly mixed, describing the atmosphere as being too \"sterile\" for a sport that \"thrives on chaos\", and that \"the bland short walks to the ring and generic music presenting the fighters as interchangeable automatons [are] more NFL than WWE\". NBC's on-air talent also received mixed reviews, especially the poor performance of Albert, explaining that \"Albert, who hasn't called boxing since 1985, sounded like a guy who hadn't called boxing in 30 years. He had a hard time keeping up with the action, eventually giving up on play-by-play and occasionally adding a booming 'Yes!' whenever a particularly telling blow landed.\"\nBoxxer.\nIn October 2023, United Kingdom based boxing promoter Boxxer announced an agreement with NBC Sports. NBC Sports will air select bouts, primarily on its streaming service Peacock, with some also on NBC."

His last was played against the US Eagles in 1994. He was known for his hard tackling and rugged style of play and was one of very few internationals of his time that came from a non-rugby playing school. He went to Bishop Ward secondary school in Dagenham where he excelled as a cross-country runner.\nO'Hara moved to Ireland in 1973 and finished his schooling at Ashton Comprehensive School in Blackrock. His early years were spent with the Sundays Well rugby club where he joined the youth section as a 12-year-old. He started his rugby career as a tight head prop before moving to the open side of the scrum the following year. He was playing senior rugby with the club as a 17-year-old and won his first senior cap for Munster against Connacht in 1983 at 22. He played on many winning Munster sides but never managed to win an interprovincial medal. Some notable wins during his time with Munster included both Gloucester and Middlesex while they were current county champions and he also played against such touring sides as the All Blacks, Australia and Fiji. He played with such players as Donal Lenihan, Michael Bradley, Moss Keane, Ralph Keyes and Tony Ward, and was in the 1991 Irish world cup squad.\nO'Hara had the distinction of winning the Irish rugby writers' \"player of the year\" award for the season 1989/1990 and won the Texaco rugby sportsperson of the year award for the same year.\nHe is now sales director of Architectural and Metal Systems based in Cork, a company that he helped establish in 1990."

The player-turned-pundit was speaking on Newstalk's \"Off the Ball\" and when asked by presenter Joe Molloy if he \"believed the percentage of gay people involved in sport was lower than the 10 per cent which is the estimate of the general population who are gay\", he said he suspected that the percentage was \"nowhere near 10 per cent. I would say in the smaller margin of 1 per cent\".\nIn November 2019, he suggested South Africa's win in the Rugby World Cup was \"tainted by steroids\".\nOn 23 July 2021, the \"Irish Independent\" newspaper terminated his contract, where he had been a columnist, following his remarks on one of their podcasts about British and Irish Lions player Marcus Smith. Francis described Smith, a half-Filipino, as having a \"David Beckham haircut and an Oompa Loompa tan\". Smith's club, Harlequin F.C., criticised the remarks as \"offensive\" and \"racist\". The Lions also criticised the remarks as \"offensive\". Francis apologised for any offence taken and for the fact that the comments were interpreted differently from what he intended."

This swimming event used medley swimming and this was the first time for this event in this distance for the women swimmers. Because an Olympic size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of eight lengths of the pool. The first two lengths were swum using the butterfly stroke, the second pair with the backstroke, the third pair of lengths in breaststroke, and the final two were freestyle. Unlike other events using freestyle, swimmers could not use butterfly, backstroke, or breaststroke for the freestyle leg; most swimmers use the front crawl in freestyle events.\nResults.\nHeats.\nHeat 1\nHeat 2\nHeat 3\nHeat 4\nFinal.\nKey: OR = Olympic record"

The knockout stage involved the eight teams who finished in the top two in each of their groups in the second group stage.\nEach tie in the knockout stage, apart from the final, was played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that has the higher aggregate score over the two legs will progress to the next round. If aggregate scores finish level, the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs will progress. If away goals are also equal, 30 minutes of extra time are played. If there are goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score is still level, the visiting team qualifies by more away goals scored. If no goals are scored during extra time, there will be a penalty shoot-out after extra time.\nIn the draw for the quarter-finals, matches are played between the winner of one group and the runner-up of a different group, with the group winner hosting the second leg.\nIn the final, the tie was played over just one leg at a neutral venue. If scores were level at the end of normal time in the final, then 30 minutes of silver goal extra time was applied, whereby the team who leads the game at the half-time break during the extra period would be declared the winner. If the scores were still level after the initial 15 minutes of extra time, the play would continue for a further 15 minutes. If teams still tied, the tie was decided by penalty shoot-out.\nTimes are CEST () as listed by UEFA (local times are in parentheses).\nQuarter-finals.\nSecond leg.\n\"Juventus won 3–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"2–2 on aggregate.

The International Federation of Football Association (FIFA) invited its member associations to bid for either the 2018 or the 2022 final tournaments, or both. The Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) and the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) submitted together a bid for both editions, but with the focus on winning the privilege to host the 2018 finals. Due to the withdrawal of all non-European bids for the 2018 edition, the Spanish-Portuguese bid, and that of all other European bidding nations, were effectively considered ineligible for the 2022 campaign.\nOn December 2, 2010, after a vote of the FIFA Executive Committee at its headquarters in Zürich, the Iberian bid lost the 2018 hosting rights to Russia, in a two-round voting, collecting seven votes against Russian's thirteen in the final round.\nDetails.\nEighteen venues across sixteen cities in Spain made the final bid package as potential host venues for the tournament. In Portugal, only the two most populous cities - Lisbon (2 venues) and Porto - earned a place in the final bid package. In all likelihood, based on the assumption that FIFA allows twelve venues for the tournament, nine venues would be allocated to Spain and the remaining three would go to Portugal.\nPotential venues.\nSubmitted bid venues.\nThe following are the 21 venues that were submitted to FIFA on 14 May 2010 as part of the FPF–RFEF's bid to host the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cup:\na: Stadium/site used in the 1982 FIFA World Cup.\nb: Stadium/site used in the UEFA Euro 2004.\nRejected bid venues.\nThe following is a list of stadiums that were considered at one time as part of the FPF–RFEF's bid to host the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cup, but did not make the final cut:"

For the #3 seed, Akron and Miami were tied with a 14–4 conference record. They had also split their two regular season matches. The next tiebreaker is to determine the teams performance against ranked teams in order. Akron was able to win one game against the Golden Flashes while Miami was unable to win one, so Akron was given the fourth seed and Miami was given the final bye in the tournament. The #5 seed was determined through a three-way tie between Ohio, Toledo, and Western Michigan. Ohio had won its matches against Western Michigan and Toledo so they were given the #5 seed. Since Toledo was able to defeat Kent State in the regular season and Western Michigan was not, they were given the #6 seed. Buffalo was seven games behind Kent State and had earned the eighth seed. Ball State was the #9 seed and the final East Division team, Bowling Green was the #10 seed.

        "title": "History of rugby union matches between France and Wales",
        "text": "France and Wales have played each other at rugby union since 1908. A total of 104 matches have been played, with Wales winning 51 times, France 50 times and the remaining three finishing as draws.\nThe early years of the fixture were dominated by Wales, who won 18 of the first 19 matches before France were expelled from the Five Nations Championship after the 1931 tournament. Since France rejoined the competition in 1947, they have won 49 of the 85 matches played, including a 12-match winning streak between 1983 and 1993. The teams have met twice in the Rugby World Cup, firstly in the semi-finals of the 2011 tournament, which France won 9–8, then in the quarter-finals of the 2019 Rugby World Cup, which Wales won 20–19.\nBreakdown.\nEarly history: Welsh domination.\nEarly in the history of the France–Wales match-up, Wales dominated the encounters with big victories from the 1908 Home Nations Internationals to the 1911 Five Nations Championship. Between 1910 and 1929, France finished wooden spooners six times in the competition, more than any other team, going back-to-back on two occasions (seasons 1912–1913 and 1925–1926). During this period France only managed to beat Wales once from a total of seventeen games. Indeed, Wales was France's most difficult Five/Home Nations Championship opponent at the time, holding just a 5.88% win percentage against them, whereas they held a 6.67% win percentage (1/15) against England, a 20% win percentage (3/15) against Ireland, and a 21.43% win percentage (3/14) against Scotland. Wales, by contrast, held a win percentage above 39% against all other Home/Five Nations Championship opponents. By the end of 1959 France and Wales had played against each other a total of thirty-two times. And although France's win percentage had improved (to 18.75%), it was still significantly lower than their win percentage against the other Five Nations Championship opponents (their lowest being 26.67% against England; their highest being 37.93% against Scotland).\n1960–1980: Turning the tide.\nFrom 1960 to 1980 the two sides had played each other on twenty-one occasions. The record was split 9–9, with three draws. By this point the tide had slowly turned to being a one-sided affair to a more competitive one. Up to that point Wales won 66.04% of their encounters and still remained France's most difficult Five Nations Championship opponent. French improvement remained consistent against all other Five Nations Championship competitors as well. Their win percentage at 1980 was 35.29% against England, 48.08% against Ireland, and 48% against Scotland.\n1980s–1990s: French command.\nSimilar to the first two decades between France and Wales, in which Wales won an overwhelming majority of fixtures played between the pair, between the years 1980 and 1999 France dominated the Welsh; they won seventeen out of twenty-three meetings (73.91%), including a twelve-match win streak between the years 1983 and 1993.\nSix Nations era: 2000–present.\nSince the introduction of the Six Nations Championship, both France and Wales have won six titles each, including four Grand Slam's. Early during the 2000s France largely maintained the stronghold that they gained throughout the previous decade, winning eight out of eleven matches. Following Wales' 2008 Six Nations Championship win over France, it took Wales four years before they would win another match (2012). In both years Wales were crowned Six Nations Champions.\nAs of 2024, both teams are each others most competitive test side, with France holding a 48.08% win percentage against Wales in their match-ups, and Wales holding a 49.04% win percentage.\nXV results.\nBelow is a list of matches that France has awarded matches test match status by virtue of awarding caps, but Wales did not award caps."

        "text": "Wasim Akram, a former Pakistani cricketer, took 31 five-wicket hauls during his career in international cricket. In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five–for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and as of 2014 only 41 bowlers have taken more than 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. A left-arm fast bowler who represented his country between 1984 and 2003, the BBC described Akram as \"one of the greatest left-arm bowlers in the history of world cricket\", while West Indian batsman Brian Lara said that Akram was \"definitely the most outstanding bowler [I] ever faced\".\nAkram made his Test debut in January 1985, in an innings defeat by New Zealand in Auckland. The following Test, in a man-of-the-match performance, he took ten wickets over the two innings, securing his first two five-wicket hauls but still ended on the losing side. He took another pair of five-wicket hauls in a single match five years later, against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). His career-best figures for an innings were 7 wickets for 119 runs against New Zealand in Wellington, in February 1994.\nMaking his One Day International (ODI) debut in 1984 against New Zealand in Faisalabad, Akram's first ODI five-wicket haul came the following year against Australia in a match which Pakistan won at the MCG. In 1989, he took five wickets in an innings, in a performance that included a hat-trick (three wickets in consecutive deliveries), against the West Indies. His career-best bowling in ODI cricket was 5 wickets for 15 runs against Zimbabwe in Karachi, in December 1993.\nRetiring from international cricket in 2003 after nearly 20 years, Akram took 25 five-wicket hauls in Test cricket and 6 in ODIs. As of 2014, his position in the all-time lists for taking five wickets in an innings the most times is seventh overall in both Tests and ODIs."

        "text": "The draw for the 2010 FIFA World Cup occurred in Cape Town, South Africa, on 4 December 2009, at 19:00 local time (UTC+2). In preparation for the draw, the qualified teams were seeded and organised into pots.\nSeeding.\nThe criteria for the seeding was released on 2 December and was, in contrast to previous World Cup seeding criteria, based solely upon the October 2009 FIFA World Rankings. Use of the most recent rankings prior to the draw (November 2009) was thought to unfairly benefit those nations who had played competitive fixtures in qualification playoffs during that month, at the expense of those who had already booked their place in the tournament.\nThe seven highest seeded teams according to the ranking criteria were placed in Pot 1, alongside the host nation South Africa (who were predetermined to be in Group A).\nThe draw.\nTeams were organised into four pots of eight teams. The seeded teams were placed in Pot 1 and the remaining teams were placed into Pots 2–4 on a geographical basis, as below.\nThe basic draw procedure was to draw out the pots starting from Pot 1. One team from each pot would be placed, in order of being drawn, into one of eight groups from A to H. After each team was allocated to a group, its position in the group was also drawn. This determined the team's placement in the predetermined fixture schedule. This was with the exception of the seeded teams, who were automatically placed in their group's Position 1.\nIn order to maintain geographical separation of teams, the basic draw procedure had to be modified for the drawing of Pot 3. No South American teams could be placed into Brazil or Argentina's groups, and no African team could be placed in South Africa's group. In order to accommodate this, the first two African teams drawn would be placed immediately into Brazil and Argentina's groups. South Africa's group (predetermined to be Group A) was to be left vacant until filled by the first South American team drawn. Beyond these considerations, the principle of filling from A to H applied.\nIn the event, the first two teams drawn from Pot 3 were Nigeria and Ivory Coast, who were placed in Argentina's Group B and Brazil's Group G respectively. Algeria were then placed in Group C so that a South American team, Uruguay, could be placed with South Africa in Group A."

        "title": "Water volleyball",
        "text": "Water volleyball (also called pool and acqua volleyball) is a competitive middle-court oriented water game. It can be played between two teams, each team consisting of 1 to 4 players, depending on the area of water in which the game is being played.\nHistory.\nWater volleyball has emerged from recreational pool activities, sports, aquatic clubs, water parks, through the practice of unification of the beach and water tournaments. In the 1990s, Disney water parks had pool volleyball entertainment. DLRG- Ortsgruppe Havixbeck, has organized first water volley tournament in 1985, creating by-so water volleyball club. US has on its own developed powerful swimming pool play, creating volley standards. Water Volleyball is played throughout US Universities, such as: University of San Diego, California, Iowa State University, Iowa, University of South Florida, St. Petersburg, Lenoir-Rhyne University, N. C., Lindsey Wilson College.\nAqua-volei.\nThe sport is known differently as aqua-volei (Brazil), voleibol acuático (Spain), Wasser-Volleyball (Germany), acqua pallavolo (Italy), vodní volejbal (Czech), splash/ pool/water volley (United States).\nRules.\nThe court.\nThe court must be a rectangle a minimum 3 meters in length to a maximum of 6 meters in length. It can be a minimum of 2 meters in width to a maximum of 5 meters in width. The net must run across the width of the court and be centered along the length so that both players have an equal amount of court in which to play. In most pools there is a deep end and a shallow end. If possible try putting the net where both players are in the deep end.\nServing.\nThe server must hit the ball upwards, towards the receiver and it must be within arms length of the receiver when standing still. The serve is not allowed to be a spike and the receiver can not spike of the serve. One team serves for 2 points then the other team serves, and play continues in this fashion. When it is 10 apiece, you start serving 1 serve each. A flip of a coin at the start of the game is used to see who serves first, or else the person in the deep end serves first.\nGame play.\nWater volleyball is played between two teams, usually consisting of 1 to 4 players.\nOne team is chosen to serve first, whereupon they serve twice, then the team which did not serve first serves twice, and play continues in this fashion. The winner is first team to score eleven points. However, if the score gets to 10 apiece, then the team to score either two points ahead of the other team, or else first to fifteen points, wins the game. There are usually 5 games in a match.\nScoring.\nThe first team to reach 11 points wins. If the score reaches 10 apiece, then it is first team to by 2 points or first to 15 points."

        "title": "List of international cricket centuries by Marcus Trescothick",
        "text": "Marcus Trescothick is an English cricketer and former opening batsman for the England national cricket team. He has scored centuries (100 or more runs) on 14 occasions in Test cricket and 12 times in One Day International (ODI) matches.\nTrescothick's first Test century was scored against Sri Lanka at Galle International Stadium in 2001, when he made 122. He then continued to score at least one century every year until his retirement from international cricket in 2006. His highest score of 219 was made against South Africa in 2003 at The Oval, London—his only double century. He has made a century in both innings of a Test match on only one occasion, against the West Indies in 2004 at Edgbaston. Despite being the first batsman to achieve this feat at Edgbaston, Trescothick was not named Man of the Match, as Andrew Flintoff's first-innings of 167 earned him the accolade instead. During the 2005 series against Bangladesh, Trescothick scored centuries in both Test matches against the touring side, helping earn him a Man of the Series award. His 14 Test centuries have been scored at 11 grounds; nine were scored in England and the remaining five were scored at different venues. Trescothick has been dismissed twice between 90 and 99, against India in 2001 and Australia in 2005.\nTrescothick's 12 ODI hundreds remained a record for an English player until Joe Root went past his tally in July 2018. Trescothick passed Graham Gooch's (the previous record-holder) tally when he scored 100 not out against Bangladesh in his 100th ODI in 2005. This was also the fastest of his career, off 76 balls, the third fastest ODI century for an English batsman. Trescothick made his first ODI century against Pakistan, scoring a career-best 137. His century the following year against India in the final of the 2002 NatWest Series, along with two fifties earlier in the competition, saw him named Man of the Series. He was again named Man of the Series in the 2003 NatWest Challenge, finishing the three-match series with a century, a fifty and more than twice as many runs as any other player. Only six days later, captaining his side against South Africa, Trescothick scored another century and, alongside fellow opener Vikram Solanki, set an English record first wicket partnership of 200. His ODI hundreds have been made against 10 different opponents, on seven different grounds. Six of his centuries have been scored in London, equally split between The Oval and Lord's.\nAfter scoring four Test centuries and two ODI centuries in 2004, Trescothick was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 2005. Between the two formats (Test and ODI), Trescothick has scored a century against every opponent he has played except Namibia and Netherlands, each of which he only faced in one ODI. Trescothick did not score a century in any of his three Twenty20 Internationals; his highest score was the 72 he scored against Sri Lanka in 2006."
