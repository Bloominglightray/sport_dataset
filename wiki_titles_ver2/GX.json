        "text": "The 1906–07 Oregon Agricultural Aggies women's basketball team represented Oregon Agricultural College (OAC, today's Oregon State University) during the 1904–05 academic year. It was the ninth academic year in which an organized women's team played games on behalf of OAC.\nThe team was independent of any organized athletic conference and scheduled its games on an ad hoc basis.\nThe team finished its season undefeated, racking up a total of 7 wins en route to an Oregon state championship.\nTeam history.\nOctober 1906.\nDaily practices began for prospective players for the Oregon Agricultural College women's basketball team shortly after school resumed for the 1906–07 academic year. Only two players were returning from the 1905–06 team, Kate Moore and Claire Holgate, with former team member Rilla Peters returning to school but electing not to participate. No final team was chosen at this early date.\nNovember 1906.\nOn November 3, representatives of various Oregon colleges and YMCAs met in Salem to organize a first formal basketball league for the state. This new organization was hampered by the non-participation of three Oregon colleges — the University of Oregon and McMinnville College, which were undecided as to whether they would field university teams in the coming year, and OAC, which was opposed to the new governing organization and boycotted the session. Consequently, it was unclear from the outset whether colleges participating in the league, including Willamette University, Pacific University, and Oregon State Normal School, would be playing the independent Aggies during the 1906–07 season.\nThe team's first game of the season was initially slated for November 17, 1906, in Monmouth against Oregon State Normal School, but the contest was postponed to Friday, November 23, owing to a scheduling conflict with the football teams of the two schools. When finally played the game was won by the visitors from OAC by a score of 8 to 4, with the victors praising the kind reception accorded them.\nDecember 1906.\nDecember was a relatively quite month for the OAC women's basketball team, with only a Friday night mid-month game scheduled against Roseburg High School. The contest was won by the Aggies by a score of 19 to 8.\nRoster.\nThe following were members of the 1906–07 OAC women's team:\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| 1906–07 Season"

        "text": "The 1923–24 Bates men's ice hockey season was the 5th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAfter claiming the state championship the previous year, coach Wiggin was hoping for an bigger profile for the ice hockey team. Unfortunately, at the first meeting of the season, only about 20 men bothered to show up. Wiggin implored any among the student body with skating experience to show up to further practices but, due to a lack of ice before the winter break, all early-season training was done inside the campus gymnasium. Despite the difficulties, many former players were available for the Garnet and the team was well sorted by the time the season began. They opened with a practice game against Jordan High School who, unfortunately, did not have a goaltender on hand. Dave Wyllie agreed to sub into the goal for the opposition and had his hands busy in the match.\nThe first official game for the team happened a few days later when they faced the Association of St. Dominique's. The amateur squad played a fast, physical game but the teamwork and passing employed by Bates helped them carry the day. Cogan's two goals were the only markers in the game and the defense kept Wyllie from seeing too much action. At the end of the week, Bates welcomed Bowdoin to town for a resumption of the annual rivalry. The fast, experienced Garnet were leagues ahead of their black and white foes and took the opening match 7–0. Due to the prowess of the Stanleys and Scott on the blueline, hardly any scoring opportunities made it to the Bates cage and whatever did get through was easily turned aside by Wyllie. Cogan's 5 goals in the game were a sign if things to come and of particular import as Leonardi had missed the game with an illness.\nAfter that strong start, the team travelled south to take on Williams but they ran into a problem. The ice on the Weston Field Rink was too soft so the teams decided to wait until the following day in the hopes of better conditions. Luckily, the rink was serviceable by the next afternoon and the Garnet were able to display their typical effective play. Following the win over the Ephs, Bates met Army for their toughest test of the season. Not only was Army a well-disciplined team, but their ice surface was in poor condition, leaving Bates to battle two different opponents in the match. While the offense wasn't suited to the slog, the Garnet defense was as strong as it had been in earlier games. Bates produced its third shutout in four games while Red Scott score the only goal of the game. Just before the exam break, Bates played a rematch with St. Dominique's and the two were evenly matched throughout. Cogan was the only one to score for Bates, however, Wyllie kept his team in the game and forced overtime. After 11 minutes, the winning tally came from A.S.D. and was the first blemish on the year for the Garnet.\nWhen the team reconvened after exams, they did so without defensive stalwart Red Scott. The captain of the football team had graduated in the interim and was no longer eligible to play, leaving the team to contend with the loss in experience and talent. Maine was next up for the Garnet and they were expecting a hard fight after two close games the year before. Wyllie, however, had other ideas and continued his rare form in goal. The netminder recorded his 4th shutout of the season while the offense did its part. The inspired play continued the next week when Bates dropped both Colby and Maine to all but guarantee themselves another state championship. Cogan had another 5-goal game by scoring every marker against the Mules but could 'only' manage a hat-trick in the rematch with the Orono squad. Wyllie's 5th shutout on the year also set a program record.\nThe rematch with Colby would decide the state championship and both teams showed up to play. The game was much more physical than the earlier meeting but the Garnet netminder was impenetrable once more. Even with poor lighting for the rink, Cogan scored the first goal for Bates and that was all the team needed for the victory. O'Connor's first goal of the season capped off the game and left the team undefeated in intercollegiate play. In the final week of the season, Bates met St. Dominique's for the rubber match to decide the season series between the two. Unfortunately, without Red Scott on hand, the Garnet were unable to hold off the fast aggregation and fell 0–4. The final game came at the Augusta Winter Sports Carnival and they faced Colby for the third time that year. Just like the previous two occurrences, Bates came away as the victor with Cogan leading the scoring charge. The victory left Bates with not only an undefeated season in intercollegiate play, but also allowed them to take home the Governor Baxter trophy as the state champions in ice hockey.\nClarence Gilpatric served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

He led the men's ice hockey team at Hobart to the program's first national championship in 2023 and was named as the national coach of the year for his efforts. Both of these accomplishments were repeated by Taylor in 2024.\nCareer.\nTaylor began his college career at SUNY Canton and played for the club team for two years. He transferred to Elmira College after his sophomore season and continued his playing career with the varsity squad. He helped the team make the NCAA tournament in his junior year but they lost in the quarterfinal round. After graduating, Taylor travelled to Europe and played for Ånge IK in the Swedish Division 2. After two years abroad, he retired as a player and turned to coaching.\nUpon his return to North America, Taylor returned to the college ranks as an assistant at Middlebury. He ended up working on four different staffs over a 4-year period before finally settling into his role at Cornell. He worked under Brian McCutcheon, who had been his head coach at Elmira, for five years but the returns for the big red weren't up to par and the entire staff was let go after the 1995 season. Taylor moved on to Massachusetts Lowell working first under Bruce Crowder and then Tim Whitehead. He was in charge of recruiting for the River Hawks and instrumental in convincing Ron Hainsey, a draft pick of the Montreal Canadiens, to sign on with the program.\nIn 2000, Taylor got his first head coaching job at Hobart and took over a program that had seen very little success in its history. Over 30 years, the team had been able to post just 5 winning seasons and had never won a championship of any kind let alone make and NCAA tournament appearance. In his first few years that trend continued, however, he got the team to post its first 10-win season in 2002 in almost a decade and had them above water the next year. In the team's fourth year under Taylor, they made the NCAA tournament firs the first time on the strength of a conference championship and continued to raise their profile under his leadership. The Statesmen posted their first 20-win season in 2006, making their first Frozen Four in the season season. Several more championships and highlights followed over the next decade plus but the team as unable to make a championship appearance during that successful run. After the pandemic the team was finally able to break through. After posing his 8th 20-win season in 2022, Taylor led Hobart to its best season in history, finishing the regular season with a 23–2 record while being ranked as the #1 team in the nation during the year. The Statesmen received the #3 overall seed for the NCAA tournament and rode a dominating defense to their first championship appearance. The team faced down defending national champions, Adrian and won the title in overtime. a few days before the game, Taylor was named as the recipient of the Edward Jeremiah Award, given annually to the national D-III coach of the year."

In 1962, Montoya registered using his real name and became the Diablos Rojos starting centerfielder, a position he held for the next 15 seasons with the México squad.\nIn 1964, Montoya played in the Texas League for the El Paso Sun Kings, where he appeared in 90 games, but he had to return to Mexico due to a clavicle fracture. \"Diablo\" won four Mexican League championships with the Diablos Rojos, in 1968, 1973, 1974 and 1976. Montoya retired in 1976; that same year, his number, 32, was retired by the Diablos Rojos.\nMontoya also played thirteen seasons in the Mexican Pacific League (LMP), debuting in the 1961–62 season for the Naranjeros de Hermosillo.

The competitor age range is from 19 to 23, and the event is designed to be a development event to aid the transition from junior to senior competition. The inaugural edition in 2023 was awarded to Dublin, Ireland.\nFormat.\nCompetition in the Under-23 championships will be held across three days, much shorter than a traditional continental championships which usually last a week. A special Skins event will be held for freestyle sprinters, as the event proved popular in the International Swimming League. Certain standard relays will not be held.\nIn addition to European nations, the Under 23 Championship rules allow non-European guest nations to be invited to increase competitiveness, at a maximum of one per continent. Swimmers from these nations will be able to win 'commemorative' medals reflecting their position in the physical race as if it was a standard non-championship meet, while the top three European swimmers will receive the championship gold, silver and bronze. As such, some events will award two silver medals, for example, one for a guest who finished second in a final, and one for the second placed European swimmer in the same race. The European swimmer is always taken to be competing in the European Championships, so does not win the lower medal they might receive in the virtual 'open' meet.\nIn the first edition, United States, Zimbabwe and South Africa accepted invitations to the championships.\nThe Championships will be scheduled every two years, immediately after or before the World Aquatics Championships. From 2025, no one eligible for junior competition may compete in the Championships.\nAll-time medal table.\nAfter the 2023 championships :"

        "title": "2023 Wuhan Open (snooker)",
        "text": "The 2023 Wuhan Open (officially the 2023 Panda Club Wuhan Open) was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 9 to 15 October 2023 at the Wuhan Gymnasium in Wuhan, China. The fifth ranking event of the 2023–24 season, it followed the 2023 English Open and preceded the 2023 Northern Ireland Open. The inaugural edition of the Wuhan Open, it was the second professional snooker tournament (following the invitational 2023 Shanghai Masters) and the first ranking event held in mainland China since the 2019 World Open, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The event was broadcast domestically in China by CCTV-5 and in Europe (including the UK) by Eurosport and Discovery+. It was available from Matchroom Sport in all other territories. The winner received £140,000 from a total prize fund of £700,000.\nQualifiers took place from 1 to 5 September at the Morningside Arena in Leicester, England. Qualifying matches featuring the top two players in the world rankings (Ronnie O'Sullivan and Luca Brecel), the two highest ranked Chinese players (Ding Junhui and Zhou Yuelong), and four Chinese wildcards were held over to be played in Wuhan. The reigning world champion Brecel withdrew in advance of the tournament's main stage, as did Mark Williams, Graeme Dott, and David Gilbert.\nJudd Trump won the tournament, defeating Ali Carter 10–7 in the final to secure the 25th ranking title of his career, which put him level with Williams in joint fifth place on the all-time list. Having claimed the English Open title the previous week, Trump won back-to-back ranking events for the fourth time in his career. He became the third player in snooker history to win back-to-back ranking tournaments in different countries, after Stephen Hendry in 1990 and Williams in 2002.\nThe qualifiers in Leicester produced 32 centuries and the main stage in Wuhan produced 69 centuries. The highest break prize was shared by Aaron Hill, who made a 145 break in his qualifying match against Joe Perry, and Carter, who made a 145 in his last-64 match against Jamie Clarke.\nFormat.\nThe tournament, the inaugural edition of the Wuhan Open, took place from 9 to 15 October 2023 at the Wuhan Gymnasium in Wuhan, China. It was the fifth ranking event of the 2023–24 season, following the 2023 English Open and preceding the 2023 Northern Ireland Open. it was the second professional snooker tournament, following the invitational 2023 Shanghai Masters, and the first ranking event held in mainland China since the 2019 World Open, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAll matches up to and including the quarter-finals were best of nine frames. The semi-finals were best of 11 frames, and the final was best of 19 frames.\nThe event was broadcast domestically in China by CCTV-5, Migu, Youku, and Huya Live and in Europe (including the UK) by Eurosport and Discovery+. It was available from Matchroom Sport in all other territories.\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for this event is shown below:\nSummary.\nQualifying round.\nQualifying for the event took place from 1 to 5 September at the Morningside Arena in Leicester, England. \nHe Guoqiang trailed by 62 points in the deciding frame against eighth seed Kyren Wilson, but made a 64 clearance to win 5–4. The 24th seed Joe Perry was whitewashed 0–5 by Aaron Hill, who made a 145 break in the fifth frame, the joint highest of the tournament. The 19th seed Anthony McGill lost 4–5 to Ishpreet Singh Chadha, who won the deciding frame on the final black ball. Other top 32 seeds who lost out during qualifying were Shaun Murphy(7), Hossein Vafaei(17), Gary Wilson(18), Ricky Walden(20), Jimmy Robertson(28), and Fan Zhengyi(31) who were beaten by Ben Mertens, Marco Fu, Ashley Carty, Ian Burns, Rod Lawler, and Stuart Carrington respectively. \nNeil Robertson made his 900th century break in professional competition (a 137) in his match against fellow Australian Ryan Thomerson. He became the fourth player in professional snooker history (after Ronnie O'Sullivan, John Higgins, and Judd Trump) to reach the 900-century milestone.\nEarly rounds.\nThe reigning world champion Luca Brecel withdrew prior to the main stage in Wuhan, as did tenth seed Mark Williams, Graeme Dott, and David Gilbert. Gilbert was replaced in the draw by Daniel Womersley. Due to time and visa constraints, the other players' opponents received walkovers.\nHeld-over qualifying matches.\nThe held-over qualifying matches were played on 9 October as the best of nine frames. O'Sullivan lost the first frame against Ken Doherty but won five in a row with breaks including 88, 89, and 82 for a 5–1 victory. Following Brecel's withdrawal, O'Sullivan's win meant he would retain the world number one ranking after the tournament unless third seed Mark Allen won the event; Allen later lost in the quarter-finals. The 15th seed Ding Junhui defeated Ashley Hugill 5–3. The 11th seed Ali Carter defeated the 2023 British Women’s Open champion Bai Yulu 5–2. Si Jiahui, a 2023 World Championship semi-finalist, made one half-century break as he defeated amateur player Wang Xinzhong by the same score.\nLast 64.\nThe round of 64 was played as the best of nine frames on 9 and 10 October, with the exception of the match between Judd Trump and Oliver Lines, which was played on 11 October due to Trump having arrived in China on 10 October after winning the 2023 English Open on 8 October. Allen trailed Mark Joyce 3–4 but recovered to win in a 26-minute deciding frame. Afterwards, Allen called his performance \"awful\" and commented: \"It's been a very long time since I’ve played that badly\". The 14th seed Jack Lisowski won the eighth frame on the black to defeat Scott Donaldson 5–3. Stephen Maguire defeated Joe O'Connor 5–2. Yuan Sijun whitewashed Ding 5–0, after Ding had whitewashed Yuan in their previous two encounters. World number 86 Martin O’Donnell, who had defeated Mark Selby in the previous week's British Open, defeated ninth seed Higgins 5–1. O’Sullivan defeated Mark Davis by the same score.\nThe fifth seed Selby lost 4–5 to Xu Si, who made a 125 break in the deciding frame. The sixth seed Neil Robertson took a 3–1 lead over Liam Highfield, making a 140 break in frame four, but Highfield won four consecutive frames with breaks of 95, 76, 63, and 68 to defeat Robertson 5–3. It was Highfield's second professional victory since an e-scooter accident that forced him to take several months away from the sport. Following his exit from the event, Robertson revealed that he would miss some tournaments at the end of the year while spending time in his native Australia. Carter made a 145 break in the fourth frame of his match against Jamie Clarke, equalling Hill's break in the qualifiers as the highest of the tournament. Carter went on to win the match 5–1. Lines made a 135 break in the fourth frame of his match against Trump, but Trump made breaks including 75, 91, 100, and 107 as he secured a 5–2 victory.\nLast 32.\nThe round of 32 was played on 11 October as the best of nine frames. Playing his second match of the day, Trump made four half-centuries as he whitewashed Matthew Selt 5–0. Lisowski defeated Sam Craigie and Allen defeated Si, both in deciding frames. Carter trailed 1–4 against Stuart Bingham, but won four consecutive frames to clinch the match 5–4. Highfield defeated Zhou 5–3. O'Sullivan won the first two frames against Pang Junxu with breaks of 68 and 128, but Pang won the next three. O'Sullivan tied the scores at 3–3 with a 93 break, but Pang went 4–3 ahead with a 107 in frame seven. However, O'Sullivan won the last two frames with breaks of 117 and 64. Barry Hawkins defeated Jamie Jones 5–1 and Maguire beat Xing Zihao by the same score.\nLast 16.\nThe round of 16 was played on 12 October as the best of nine frames. O'Sullivan won the first frame against Yuan, who took the second with a 112 century. O'Sullivan made breaks including 130, 64, and 82 as he took a 4–1 lead. In the final frame, O'Sullivan trailed by 58 points and required blacks with all reds, which were in difficult positions on the table. After winning the frame for a 5–1 victory, O'Sullivan said: \"I quite like that sort of challenge sometimes. I didn’t expect to win it, but you know what you have to do and know you need to go red, black, red, black to have a chance. There is nothing to lose in a frame like that\". Hawkins made a 109 century in the first frame against Trump, who won the next two with breaks of 76 and 59. Hawkins tied the scores at 2–2 with an 84 break. However, Trump produced breaks of 97, 67, and 100 as he won three consecutive frames for a 5–2 victory. \nLisowski won the opener against Allen with a 118 century, but Allen won the next four frames with breaks including 54, 76, and 61. Lisowski won the sixth with a 79 break, but Allen took the seventh after a lengthy safety battle for a 5–2 win, reaching his first quarter-final of the season. Allen praised Lisowski afterwards, calling him a \"class player\" and saying: \"You need to play well to beat him and I played better today. He will get me back in the future no doubt\". Playing professionally in China for the first time, 21-year-old Irish player Aaron Hill reached the first quarter-final of his career with a 5–3 victory over He Guoqiang. Carter defeated Highfield 5–1, while Wu Yize defeated Maguire 5–4, winning the deciding frame on a re-spotted black.\nLater rounds.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played on 13 October as the best of nine frames. In the afternoon session Trump whitewashed Tom Ford 5–0, making a 118 break in the third frame. Trump reached the semi-finals of the event having lost only four frames. Wu defeated Hill 5–4, making a 104 break in the deciding frame to reach his first ranking semi-final. In the evening session, Lyu Haotian defeated O'Sullivan 5–1 to reach his fifth ranking semi-final; O'Sullivan praised Lyu afterwards, saying: \"He didn’t miss much, scored well, played good safety and potted some good pressure balls\". Carter made breaks of 78, 63, 77, 52, and 57 to beat Allen 5–2. Allen's defeat meant that O'Sullivan retained the world number one ranking.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played on 14 October as the best of 11 frames. In the first semi-final between Carter and Lyu, the scores were tied at 2–2 at the mid-session interval. Carter produced breaks of 96, 122, 91, and 70 to win four consecutive frames and defeat Lyu 6–2. It was Lyu's fourth loss in his five ranking semi-final appearances. Carter said afterwards: \"Anyone will tell you that it is never easy to get over the line and reach a big final. To clear up and make it a relatively easy day’s work was pleasing\". Trump faced Wu in the second semi-final and made breaks of 110, 53, 77, and 52 as he took a 4–0 lead. Wu won frame five with a 68 break, but Trump made breaks of 127 and 63 as he clinched a 6–1 victory. On facing Carter in the final, Trump said: \"Ali will probably make it a lot more difficult than some of the younger players have done. I think he is similar to Barry Hawkins, in that you have to earn everything\".\nFinal.\nTrump and Carter contested the final on 15 October, played as the best of 19 frames over two sessions. Trump was competing in a second consecutive ranking final, having won the English Open the previous week, while Carter, with two previous tournament wins in China, was playing in his 12th career ranking final and his third ranking final of 2023. Trump won the opening frame with a 72 break, but Carter won the second with a 103 century. Trump won three consecutive frames for a 4–1 advantage, but Carter responded to win four consecutive frames and lead 5–4 after the first session. \nTrump began the second session with breaks of 116, 56, and 71 to win another three consecutive frames for a 7–5 lead. Carter took the 13th with a 56 break, but Trump won the 14th to maintain a two-frame advantage at 8–6. Carter had the opportunity to win the 15th but missed a pot on the green to a middle pocket, which let Trump go 9–6 in front. The 16th frame was decided on the pink, on which both players missed shots before Carter potted it on his second attempt to narrow Trump's lead to 9–7. However, Trump made a 105 century in the 17th frame to secure a 10–7 victory and claim the 25th ranking title of his career, which put him level with Williams at joint fifth on the all-time list. It was the fourth time in his professional career that Trump had won back-to-back ranking tournaments. He became the third player to win successive ranking tournaments in different countries, after Stephen Hendry in 1990 and Williams in 2002. \"My record in finals over the last five to ten occasions hasn’t been as good as it was before, so it was nice to get the win\", Trump said afterwards. \"I gave it my best go and it has been a successful week\", commented Carter, remarking the Wuhan Open was such a big-money event that his £63,000 runner-up prize was \"almost like a tournament win\" in terms of its impact on the world rankings.\nMain draw.\nThe draw for the tournament is shown below.

        "text": "The Pupuke Rugby League Club were a rugby league club which existed briefly in 1917 and competed in the Auckland Rugby League competitions. They were based in Takapuna on Auckland's North Shore in New Zealand.\n1917 season.\nOn May 17, 1917, the Pupuke rugby league club was granted affiliation with the Auckland Rugby League at their weekly management meeting. They entered a single team in the 3rd grade competition. The Observer newspaper reported that “Takapuna is the latest recruit to Northern Unionism. Forty-three lads there have formed a club to be known as the Pupuke Club. One team has been entered in the third grade competitions to play in all red jerseys”.\nTheir first match was against Newton Rangers at 3pm on May 19 at Takapuna with the referee Mr. F. Tyson. There was no result reported in the newspapers for the match. During the following week it was reported that W.E. Thorpe had transferred to the club from Newton. They then played City Rovers on May 26 and lost 5–12. The Auckland Star reported that McGirr scored their try and Thorpe converted it.\nThey then lost to North Shore Albions on June 2 by 6 points to 0 before registering their first win, over North Shore rivals Northcote &amp; Birkenhead Ramblers by 5 points to 0. During the week their team list was published in the Auckland Star newspaper and was as follows: Adams, Quedley, Creamer, De Piua, Warinan (captain), Stewart, Henderson, Thorpe, Dunn, Brown, Gibbons, Sheriff, Holmes, Patrick, Brunton, and Moseley. They were scheduled to play North Shore again on June 23 but there were no matches played due to poor weather. Their 5th match was eventually played, against North Shore after being rescheduled for June 30. They lost by 11 points to 5.\nThere were very few results reported over the remainder of the season. They played matches against Northcote on July 7, City on July 14, North Shore on July 21, and City once again on July 28 with a 28–0 loss. Their last competition match of the season and ultimately ever, was against Northcote on August 11. As this was beyond the end of the championship matches it is possible that this was a rescheduled match from earlier in the season. Then on August 23 the Pupuke club wrote a request to the Auckland Rugby League to play a fancy costume match “in aid of the Navy League” and permission was granted provided the match was under the supervision of officials from the league. The events of the match were not reported.\nAt the start of the 1918 season it was reported in the Auckland Star that the club was scheduled to have their team weighed in on Thursday, April 18. However they ultimately never entered a team in any grade and they thereafter ceased to exist.

        "text": "The 1965 Television Tournament was an invitational amateur snooker tournament. Apart from one of the semi-finals, it was held at the National Liberal Club in London, UK, as a series of matches starting on 5 December 1963 and with the final held on 3 April 1965. The competition was organised by the Billiards Association &amp; Control Council and shown on ITV in the United Kingdom.\nJonathan Barron had won the invitational pro-am 1962–63 Television Tournament by defeating 4–3 Ron Gross 4–3 in the final, and also its successor, the 1964 Television Tournament, that time with a 4–3 defeat of Mario Berni in the final. Barron was not among the eight participants in 1965.\nThe 1965 final was played on 3 April at the National Liberal Club, between Pat Houlihan and Eric Stickler. Houlihan won 4–1 to take the title. \nSummary.\nThe first round and semi-finals were played as best-of-five s matches. The first match, on 5 December 1964, saw Houlihan eliminate John Spencer 4–2; it was the first time that either player had been in a televised match. The highest of the encounter was Spencer's 60 in the fifth frame. Berni defeated Dennis Robertson 4–1, and made the match's highest break on 66 in frame three; television commentary was provided by Ted Lowe. In the first frame of his contest against Mark Wildman, Marcus Chapman made the match's highest break, 35, but he lost 4–1 overall. Eric Stickler eliminated Ron Gross.\nRusholme Conservative Club, Manchester was the venue for the semi-final between Houlihan and Berni on 13 February; it was the only match in the tournament not played at the National Liberal Club. Houlihan won 4–0. The match referee, Fred Mayall, commented that he thought Berni was \"under his usual form\". Billiards Association &amp; Control Council Chairman Harold Philips agreed, but felt that Houlihan was \"playing better than ever before\". In the other semi-final, Stickler defeated Wildman 4–1.\nJust over two weeks before the Television Tournament final, Houlihan had won the English Amateur Championship, after an 11–3 victory against Spencer in the final. In many British newspapers, this received more coverage than the professional World Snooker Championship title match between John Pulman and Fred Davis held at the same time. Houlihan won the Television title by defeating Stickler 4–1 in the final. It was his 17th consecutive competitive match win, in a sequence dating back to 1964.\nReferences.\nBook"

        "title": "1926–27 Bates Bobcats men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1926–27 Bates men's ice hockey season was the 8th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAfter two forgettable seasons for the Bobcats, the ice hockey team was chomping at the bit to recover its past glory. A mostly veteran lineup returned and while the defense had to be remade, the forward contingent was the same that led the turnaround at the end of the previous season. Lou Foster centered Howard White and team captain Al Lane with all three expected to continue their scoring exploits. With no experienced goaltender on the team, coach Wiggin turned to Manny Palmer in goal and hoped that the new recruit would hold up under pressure.\nThe first game for the team happened just after New Years against an amateur club led by the four Turcotte brothers. The game had a late start and was dominated by physical play and diminishing light but the Bobcats were still able to pull of the win. Palmer was busy in the match but acquitted himself well with his first career shutout. A few days later the team travelled to Durham to battle New Hampshire but were done in by a small rink and unfamiliar tactics. The Wildcats fired several long shots on goal and the defense was unable to get control of the puck time and again. The offense for Bates was apparent, however, the opposing goaltender played a masterful game and only allowed a single goal to the Garnet.\nThe following week, Bates was again on the road, this time facing the UMass Aggies. The game was a close-fought battle that required 2 overtime periods to decide. In the first extra frame, the Bobcats found themselves down by 2 men on the penalty kill but managed to survive. Unfortunately, in the second overtime, the opposing captain netted the winning goal and gave Bates another loss. A few days later, a winter storm swept through the region that damaged the ice surface at Army. The entire pleb class was called out to sweep the rink in the hoped of making it usable but there was nothing that could be done in time. Army offered to hold the game early the following week, however, because Bates was scheduled to play Bowdoin on Tuesday, the team was forced to decline and the game was cancelled.\nThe exhibition match with Bowdoin started off with the Polar Beas taking a 3-goal lead after the first. Bates then stormed back with 6 goals, the final with only a few minutes remaining, to take the game and send their old foes packing. That game seemed to be the turning point of the season and the Garnet began to show a greater level of teamwork than they had previously. Against a much larger squad from Colby, the Bobcats skated rings around the Mules, peppering the net with 34 shots. Bates built a 2-goal lead by the start of the third period. However, Colby was able to score twice in the final period to force overtime. The extra period was a fast and durious affair with both teams scrambling to get the winning goal. White ended up being the hero for the Bobcats, firing the puck through a maze of bodies. Winter storms affted the next few games, which were all played at the covered Bartlett Street Rink as a result. After playing in a swamp against the Aggies, Bates put up solid performances in games against St. Dominique's and their alumni squad and the team was looking good as they headed into the exam break.\nUpon their return, the team was buoyed by the addition of several freshman who, having now passed their first semesters, were now eligible for varsity play. Cruiser Cogan, younger brother for former standout Joe Cogan, took over at center. This allowed Foster to drop back to defense, where he had played previously. Secor joined a deep defensive corps while Raoul Violette took over in goal. The new-look Bobcats met Colby in a snowstorm and, as a result, the two played four 15-minute periods so that they could remove the precipitation more often. The game was slowed as a result but Bates eked out a narrow win thanks to the infusion of new players. The first true match with Bowdoin was up next and the Bobcats got into another nail-biter. Bates carried the play in the first, getting a goal from Cogan, but the Bears picked up the pace as the game wore on. The physicality increased and saw both teams getting called for penalties in the third. Bowdoin knotted the match in the second and neither team seemed able to win in regulation. With less than two minutes to play, Lane whacked the puck into the Bowdoin cage for the winning marker. The following game against Colby saw the team take a 2-goal lead after the first and then try to coast to victory. Coach Wiggin used several alternates afterwards but the Mules seemed unable to take advantage. Near the end of the third, however, Colby scored twice to send the game into overtime and then netted the winner in the second extra frame.\nWhile Bates was supposed to play Bowdoin a second time after an earlier match had been called off, they weren't able to arrange the rematch. The team tried to convince the Polar Bears to let the exhibition game stand as an official match but Bowdoin declined and insisted a true rematch be held instead. Unfortunately, nothing materialized and the two were forced to settle the series on one match. The result, however, was a state championship for Bates as they had also taken the season series from Colby.\nEmery Goody served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The Brazil bid for the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup is a bid to host the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup by Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF). The single bid will be announced on 17 May 2024. The bid entailed 10 venues in 10 host cities. The bid book was submitted on 9 December 2023. The slogan of the bid is titled: \"A Natural Choice\".\nBackground.\nThe Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF), along with the city hall of Rio de Janeiro, have expressed interest in participating in the election for the 2027 World Cup. The country was already one of the finalists for the 2023 edition, but had to withdraw its candidacy due to the lack of support from the federal government, in addition to the financial crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The project is part of a study carried out by the Rio Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau (RCV), which also makes possible other events with Olympic sports and FIFA tournaments in Rio de Janeiro until 2032, including the 2031 Pan American Games, using the city again as host (since it hosted the competition in 2007), reusing the structures used in the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics.\nIt also highlighted the experience of hosting major events, such as the 1950 and 2014 FIFA World Cup, 2007 Pan American Games and 2007 Parapan American Games, 2016 Summer Olympics and 2016 Summer Paralympic Games, as well events like the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship, the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, the 2019 Copa América and the 2021 Copa América as a replacement of Argentina and Colombia due to COVID-19 pandemic in South America.\nProposed venues.\nOn 1 March 2023, the city of São Paulo expressed interest in participating in the election with Rio de Janeiro, offering the Arena Corinthians and Allianz Parque to receive the matches. The next day, CBF President Ednaldo Rodrigues sent a letter to FIFA, confirming the country's intention to compete in the 2027 World Cup. Other Brazilian cities can also participate in the project, as the event involves the entire country. On 7 March the Brazilian Minister of Sports, Ana Moser, confirmed the country's bid to host the tournament. Then, the cities of Salvador, Brasília, Cuiabá, Belém, Manaus and Fortaleza also offered to host the World Cup in an event on SAFs and the football capital market, organized by the Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV) on 11 March. Among the capitals that offered, only Belém did not host the last men's World Cup in the country in 2014, losing its place to Manaus. \nOn September 28, 2023, the CBF confirmed the cities of Belo Horizonte, Brasília, Cuiabá, Fortaleza, Manaus, Porto Alegre, Recife, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Salvador as the capitals that will make up the official Brazilian candidacy document, with Belém leaving the project and the inclusion of the capital of Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul, increasing the number of candidates for the World Cup to ten. The locations are similar to those of the 2014 men's edition, but without the inclusion of Curitiba and Natal in future matches.\nMarketing.\nThe logo of the bid was unveiled in 5 December 2023. The logo, symbolizing equality, nature, and sustainability, features organic shapes resembling water flow forming a “B” for Brazil, with curves suggesting a footballer performing a “keepie-uppie” move. Blue symbolizes purity and green denotes nature and sustainability, reflecting the tournament’s environmental commitment. Modern typography complements the organic symbol, resulting in a memorable visual identity. The design underscores the essence of Brazilian women’s football, emphasizing its role in gender equality and the broader societal importance of sports. The brand identity celebrates both Brazil and women, encapsulating their significance in the project’s mission. This concerted effort in crafting a visually appealing and meaningful brand identity is integral to the success and impact of the project, ensuring it resonates with its target audience and effectively communicates its message of empowerment and equality in women’s football. Through meticulous attention to detail and thoughtful design choices, the brand identity encapsulates the spirit and values of Brazilian women’s football, reinforcing its position as a symbol of strength, resilience, and progress in the face of adversity. By leveraging the power of branding and visual communication, the project aims to elevate the visibility and recognition of women’s football in Brazil and beyond, fostering a culture of inclusivity, diversity, and empowerment within the sport and society at large, the slogan \"A Natural Choice\" was unveiled on 25 August 2023. The logo was designed by British agency Luiza Iglesias Design Studio."

        "text": "The South Africa bid for the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup was a bid to host the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup by South African Football Association (SAFA). The single bid was announced on 20 September 2022. The bid entailed 10 venues (8 used in 2010 FIFA World Cup) in 9 host cities. On November 24, 2023, SAFA announced that they have withdrawn their bid and will instead focus on submitting a bid for the 2031 tournament.\nBackground.\nMotivated by the success of the country's recent participation in FIFA women's tournaments, the South African Football Association (SAFA) previously submitted a bid for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, but withdrew its bid in December 2019. SAFA CEO Hay Mokoena stated that South Africa would consider bidding for 2027 after the women's league and national team become more competitive.\nSouth Africa has hosted the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2010 FIFA World Cup and could use the infrastructure that was built for the tournament. In September 2022, South Africa announced its bid to host the 2027 women's edition. A successful bid would be Africa's first time hosting the Women's World Cup.\nProposed venues.\nOn 13 June 2023, the South African Football Association announced the ten stadiums selected for its bid. Eight out of the ten stadiums used for the 2010 FIFA World Cup would be in use for the tournament; of those ten, Ellis Park and Loftus Versfeld were not selected, while Orlando Stadium and Griqua Park were added to the bid.\nConcerns.\nAfter violence and gunshots during the 2022–23 SAFA Second Division playoffs, SAFA expressed concern about the impact of the violence on the bid."

The bid was announced on 24 March 2023. The slogan of the bid is titled: \"Breaking New Ground\".\nBackground.\nNetherlands originally wanted to bid by themselves as early as 2018. They later asked Belgium and Germany about potentially co-hosting the tournament. In October 2020, their intent to bid was officially announced.\nBelgium and the Netherlands have previously co-hosted the UEFA European Championship in 2000, and Belgium had hosted it earlier in 1972. Germany has been the host for the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011, the UEFA Women's Euro 2001, the FIFA Men's World Cup in 1974 and 2006, and the men's UEFA Euro 1988. Germany is also slated to host the men's UEFA Euro 2024. Both Germany and the Netherlands hosted several matches during the multi-national UEFA Euro 2020. The Netherlands was the host nation for the UEFA Women's Euro 2017.\nProposed venues.\nOn the 9 August, Germany proposed the host cities are Cologne, Dortmund, Duisburg and Düsseldorf, all located in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Aachen, Gelsenkirchen and Mönchengladbach were not chosen. However, on 6 September 2023, Duisburg withdrew due to problems with their stadium not meeting requirements. Gelsenkirchen was named the replacement on the 27 September 2023.\nThe proposed host cities in the Netherlands would be Amsterdam, Eindhoven, Enschede, Heerenveen, and Rotterdam. \nThe proposed host cities in Belgium are Genk, Anderlecht, Gent and Charleroi. While Brussels, Brugges and Liège, who all possess the three biggest stadium in the country, were not selected as cities for Belgium. Regarding the capital Brussels, the King Baudouin Stadium did not meet some requirements and the local government didn't think there was enough time fix the problems, leading to Brussels' exclusion. Charleroi will have a new stadium to be built in time should the Belgium-Germany-Netherlands bid be awarded. \nEither Amsterdam or Dortmund could host the final."

The Bulldogs represented the University of Minnesota Duluth in the 2023–24 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season, played their home games at AMSOIL Arena and were coached by Scott Sandelin in his 24th season.\nSeason.\nIn August, junior defenseman Will Francis announced that his cancer had relapsed. Due to treatment, he would miss at least the first half of the season but was hoping to return to the lineup by January. Unfortunately, he ended up sitting out the entire season. Unfortunately, they wasn't the only bad bit of news for the Bulldogs this year. Just 3 games into the season, Dominic James dislocated his shoulder and tore cartilage in the process. The injury required surgery to fix and he would miss the remainder of the year. And then, in December, the NCAA ruled Cole Spicer academically ineligible for the remainder of the season.\nThe loss of those three players, all NHL draft picks, hamstrung the Bulldogs from the start of the season. Duluth was able to get off to a decent start, going undefeated in their first 5 games, but everything changed when they travelled to play Cornell. The Big Red were one of the top defensive teams and demonstrated as much by holding UMD to a single goal over the weekend. That began a string of five weeks against ranked teams and the Bulldogs were only able to win one game. Though the goaltending tandem of Zach Stejskal and Matthew Thiessen wasn't quite up to par, the bigger problem for Duluth was the lack of scoring. The offense was run through Ben Steeves, who led the team in scoring for the second straight year, but beyond him the team didn't have much in the way of goal scoring.\nAfter the terrible stretch in the first half, Duluth looked much better in January and was able to get two wins over ranked teams when its offense finally woke up, albeit on an inconsistent basis. At the start of February the team was nearly at .500 and still had a slim chance at an NCAA tournament berth but they were staring down a gauntlet of lethal opponents. The final 10 games for UMD were all against ranked teams and the Bulldogs went winless in the first eight matches. Both the offense and defense weren't up to the challenge and despite Minnesota Duluth sweeping St. Cloud State to end the regular season, the team was dropped to 7th in the conference and had no chance at securing an at-large berth.\nDuluth's opponent for the first round of the conference tournament was Denver and the #3 Pioneers took no pity on the Bulldogs. After getting shutout in the first game, Denver had a 3-goal lead in the rematch and looked to be sailing to the semifinals. Goals from Luke Loheit and Kyle Bettens pulled Duluth within one with just over 2 minutes to play. Duluth pulled Thiessen for an extra attacker for their second marker but they were unable to get a third. Instead, Denver scored two empty-net goals and ended Duluth's season. \nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "1922–23 Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1922–23 Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey season was the 6th season of play for the program. The Eagles were coached by Fred Rocque in his 3rd season.\nSeason.\nBoston College entered its third season under Fred Rocque with a vastly expanded schedule. Team captain Ed Garrity wrote an op-ed in the student newspaper, presenting a case for great optimism for the program. One of the biggest reasons for his assertion was that all of the players who were on the previous year's (claimed but unrealized) championship team were back with the Eagles. Coach Rocque echoed his captain's sentiment and pushed the team heard through their training sessions in December. While a number of new freshmen were keen to join the team, the starting lineup was almost unchanged from a year ago. Once more, BC attempted to lure Harvard into an official game rather than the exhibition match that the Crimson had accented to a year before. As Harvard were the three-time defending champions, the Eagles saw this potential game as key to their claim for a championship. The Crimson, however, remained coy about the match and never agreed to term with BC.\nOn Christmas day, Boston College opened its season with a preliminary match against the Boston Hockey Club. The team they faced was composed of former college players and the Eagles did well to come out of the game with a tie. A bigger test came three days later when McGill arrived for their seemingly annual trip south. The Redmen had taken BC to task a year before but the Eagles were well prepared for the Canadian invaders. BC outplayed the men from Montreal and strangled the McGill offense with the outstanding play of Garrity and Leo Morrissey. Fitzgerald, too, was stout in goal and limited the reds to just a single goal. The BC offense was in full flight and ended the night with three goal to avenge their loss from '21.\nThe Eagles were feeling even better about their prospects after the auspicious start and seemed to take MIT a bit lightly a few weeks later. While BC was in control for the entire game, the Eagles didn't show the same fight they had in December. Fortunately, the defense was still on point and prevented any lapses by the forwards from triggering an upset. Bill Morrissey, Len's younger brother, played opposite to Garrity in Len absence and didn't look out of place on the blueline. The following night, the team faced Red Synnott's Victorias Hockey Club and the Eagles resumed their early-season form. Despite some doomsayers projecting a loss on the Eagles, BC got off to a quick start and Culhane had the Maroon and Gold on the scoresheet in under 2 minutes. Sonny Foley scored on a pass from Culhane in the second and was the darling of the crowd, skating in a flourish all night. Unfortunately, he took a hard tumble in the later portion of the match that cost him a tooth and forced him to miss the end of the game. Luckily, Boston College was ahead by then and the total team defense was effective in keeping the Victorias back. Culhane's second goal of the evening finished off the scoring and turned BC into the prohibitive favorites for the intercollegiate title.\nDespite a two-week gap in their schedule, the Eagles were unable to add any games and had to contend themselves with practice sessions until the 26th when they met Boston University. Even with Culhane out of the lineup, the Eagles' attack was impressive. The BU goalie, however, put on a masterful performance and kept a sure goal out of the net time and again. The Eagles' defense, however, didn't seem to take the scarlet skaters seriously and took it easy in the first part of the match. BC received a shock at the start of the second when it suddenly found itself down by a goal. While the team shored up its defenses, there was no panic on the offensive side as the Eagles believed they could score at will against their Bostonian counterparts. However, Boston University pulled its forwards back afterwards and played a 5-man defense in the hopes of carrying their lead to the end. Nearly two periods passed before the eagles could respond and it was former captain, Leo Hughes, who was the hero of the night by tying the match in the waning moments. Two 5-minute overtime sessions were agreed upon which was to be followed by a sudden death period if the score remained even. In the first mist of extra play, BU regained the lead and once more tried to hold off the Eagles. This time it was current captain Garrity who knotted the score with seconds to spare in the second overtime. By the time the third overtime began, both teams looked exhausted. The only sub that BC had used in the match was Groden, but BU wasn't in much better shape. After about 15 minutes of play from the tired men, Len Morrissey stole the puck, made a desperate rush towards the net and fired the puck into the goal for the winning score. A week later the teams met in a rematch with Culhane back on the ice. BU was unable to get a repeat performance from their goaltender and surrendered 7 goals to fully-powered eagles, extending BC's unbeaten streak to six.\nWith the Eagles as the front-runners for the title, they accepted a game with the Canadian collegiate champions, Queen's. Even if Boston College couldn't schedule a match with Harvard, they could at least get in a match with a squad that was no worse than the Crimson's equal. The anticipation for the game caused spectators to pack themselves into the Boston Arena and watch as the large Canadians took on the smaller, but faster, Eagle sextet. Foley and Culhane appeared to skate rings around the Gaels and distracted the Queen's defenders long enough for Hughes to pot two goals. Meanwhile, Len Morrissey, Garrity and Fitzgerald played one of the best defensive games ever seen from a college team and held the Gales to a single goal. The mildly stunning win gave Boston College a claim on an international college title so long as they could hold onto their domestic crown.\nA little over a week later, BC headed out on its only road trip of the season. The team was set to play four games in four days starting with a match against Army. This was the final game in a long season for the Cadets, who had posted a respectable record. The West Pointers were no match for the Eagles, however, and BC hammered their opponents 9–1. The next day the team was set against Hamilton who were at the end of a rather down year. Boston College were again victors in a lopsided match. The games were so controlled by BC that Dan Murphy was inserted into the goal in both matches. Probably the biggest note of the weekend was the return of John Curry, who had missed most of the season due to injury. The Eagles ended their trip with a two-night stay in Buffalo against the Nichols Club. Similar to the Boston Hockey Club, Nichols was stocked with former college stars and would prove a much tougher challenge than the other two New York teams. Fitzgerald proved to be the deciding factor in both games, holding on to a narrow lead in the first that was provided by Leo Hughes, the BC netminder then shutout Nichols in the rematch to give the team a clean sweep of their road trip.\nAfter returning home the team was able to get in some needed rest before a match against the Boston Athletic Association. Once more, the defense was impenetrable and Fitzgerald earned his third shutout of the year. Culhane was injured by a hard check in the middle of the game and Groden stepped in to take his place. By the third, however, Culhane was back on the ice and he teamed up with Foley to score the first goal of the game and break the deadlock. Len Morrissey added another to end the scoring and give the Eagles the unquestioned title of 'Eastern Intercollegiate Champions'.\nThe newly minted champions were not finished with their season, however, and played a match against a club team from Duluth. The Eagles were slow out of the gate and found themselves down by a goal just 30 seconds into the match. Culhane evened the score several minutes later but BC knew they had a fight on their hands. The Minnesotans were at least as fast as the Eagles and Boston College was not able to simply outskate their opponents as they had done all season. Just before the close of the first, two Duluth skaters broke through the BC defense and scored to regain the lead. The two team battled to get the next goal but neither netminder was accommodating. BC was constantly having to play a stout defense to hold off Duluth that, though it succeeded, curtailed their efforts to tie the game. In the end the team ran out of time and opportunity and were never able to overcome the second deficit.\nThough no longer undefeated, the team still had one final game to play and met the New Haven Hockey Club for their season finale. Taking a page from Duluth, BC got off to a quick start and scored three goals in the first few minutes of the game. New Haven responded with a redoubled defensive effort and then cut into the lead but the Eagles' advantage was too much. BC ended the year with their twelfth win and set a program record that would stand for almost 20 years.\nTom Cannon served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "Thomas O. Schneider (July 14, 1946 – March 17, 2015) was an American basketball coach and player. From 1983 to 1993, he was a men's basketball head coach at NCAA Division I Mid-Atlantic mid-majors Lehigh, Penn and Loyola, with the first two each making a national tournament appearance.\nEarly life.\nSchneider was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on July 14, 1946. He matriculated at Bucknell University where he was a three-year letterman on the Bison men's basketball team from 1966 to 1969. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science in 1969. He later earned a Master of Arts in History from Georgetown University.\nCoaching career.\nSchneider began his coaching career at Rockville High School for one year in 1970–71. He stayed in the Washington metropolitan area when he returned to college basketball as an assistant coach with American in 1971–72 and George Washington from 1972 to 1979. His one year at American coincided with his graduate studies at Georgetown. He moved to the University of Pennsylvania in a similar capacity on the staffs of Bob Weinhauer for three seasons from 1979 to 1982 and Craig Littlepage for the 1982–83 campaign.\nHis first head coaching appointment was at Lehigh University where he was named on June 16, 1983, to succeed Brian Hill who had left to join the Penn State coaching staff two months earlier on April 13. In his second and last year at Lehigh in 1985, the Engineers qualified for its first-ever NCAA tournament by winning the East Coast Conference tourney despite a 12–18 overall record. Its season ended with a 68–43 East Regional first-round defeat to top-ranked defending national champion Georgetown. Assistant coach Fran McCaffery was promoted on September 14, six days after Schneider's departure from Lehigh.\nSchneider returned to Penn on September 8, 1985, succeeding Littlepage who had left for Rutgers University two days earlier. In his second year at Penn in 1987, the Quakers captured the Ivy League championship before a 113–82 East Regional first-round loss to North Carolina at the NCAA tournament. Prior to assistant coach Fran Dunphy being promoted to replace him, Schneider compiled a 51–54 overall record in his four years with the Red and Blue.\nHe announced on March 15, 1989, his departure from the Quakers to succeed Mark Amatucci in a similar capacity at Loyola College in Maryland. A 1–10 start to the 1992–93 season resulted in Schneider's resignation prior to the opening of conference play. Athletic director Joe Boylan replaced him on an interim basis to complete a 2–25 campaign. The most notable player during Schneider's years with the Greyhounds was starting point guard Michael Malone.\nHe was an assistant with John Shumate's staff at Southern Methodist University for one campaign in 1993–94. He was also a volunteer assistant with the Polk State College Eagles men's basketball team from 2005 to 2012.\nLater years and death.\nSchneider was a history professor at Polk State Lakeland Collegiate High School from its inception in 2005 to his death at age 68 of coronary artery disease on March 17, 2015."

The Vikings will play a transitional conference schedule in their first two seasons, meeting each CCHA opponent for one weekend series each year (16 games). None of the games against their conference opponents were counted in the league standings. As a result, Augustana is ineligible for the conference tournament until 2026. Despite this, because Augustana was starting its program at the Division I level and not moving up from a lower level, they were eligible for the NCAA tournament in their first season.\nUnsurprisingly, Augustana finished with a losing record in their inaugural season but the team was anything but unsuccessful. Early in the season, a tie against one of the top teams in the nation, Denver was followed up by defeating another tournament-hopeful in Colorado College. While the Vikings weren't able to sustain that level of play, the team did demonstrate that they were more than just a collection of spare parts and castaways. The team had many close losses throughout the year, several against well-regarded programs such as Notre Dame. The season's biggest win, however, came against #16 Arizona State, the first victory for the Vikings over a ranked opponent.\nDepartures.\nNone; Augustana did not field a club team prior to their first varsity season.\nRecruiting.\nThe entire roster was complied of new entries to the program.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "Russ Taylor (baseball broadcaster)",
        "text": "Russell Taylor (August 19, 1926 – August 19, 1977) was a Canadian Major League Baseball play-by-play broadcaster who worked alongside lead announcer Dave Van Horne on the Montreal Expos’ English-language radio network for the first eight years of the expansion team’s existence, through . Taylor also was a notable sportscaster for Montreal’s CFCF radio and CFCF-TV television outlets. His daughter is actress and comedian Carolyn Taylor. \nTaylor began his radio career with CFCF in 1948 as a control-room engineer. During the 1950s, he called play-by-play action—including studio recreations of road games—for the Montreal Royals of the International League, one of the Triple-A affiliates of the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers. When the Royals left Montreal after the 1960 season, the city and Taylor were bereft of professional baseball for eight years. \nMontreal Expos.\nThen, in , Montreal unexpectedly was awarded one of two new National League expansion teams—and the Expos became Canada's first MLB franchise. Taylor, by then a sportscaster for CFCF, was instrumental in identifying Jarry Park to city and team officials and league president Warren Giles as a potential location for a temporary ballpark to house the club while a new stadium was constructed. Montreal’s lack of a suitable interim facility endangered the city’s franchise award, but the last-minute selection of the municipal site, and the decision to expand a small sports field to a 30,000-seat temporary venue, staved off the crisis. \nThe Expos' first major-league game took place on April 8, 1969, at Shea Stadium against the New York Mets. As \"O Canada\" was being sung during the pre-game ceremonies, Pennsylvania native Van Horne “looked over at his broadcast partner, born-and-bred Montrealer Russ Taylor, and saw tears streaming down his cheeks. ‘I thought, “Wow!\"' remembered Van Horne. '\"This is much bigger to every Canadian, not just Montrealers and Quebecers, than I had anticipated\".'”\nTaylor’s eight-season tenure as a member of the club’s radio team coincided with its tenancy at Jarry Park before the Expos moved into Montreal’s Olympic Stadium in 1977. That season, Taylor also moved—from the radio booth to the Expo front office as director of communications. However, he was not able to serve a full year in his new post, succumbing to a heart attack on his 51st birthday on August 19.\nSaid fellow Montreal sportscaster Dick Irvin Jr. in a tribute that was aired on the day of Taylor’s death: “Russ loved Jarry Park, he loved the broadcasts, and he loved baseball—he loved the life, he loved the travels, he loved sitting around talking baseball [and] playing trivia, and he loved the Expos.”\nIrvin also recalled that a youthful Taylor had recommended a future Hockey Hall of Fame broadcaster, Danny Gallivan, to the Montreal Canadiens and Hockey Night in Canada, when they were searching for a play-by-play announcer. While Taylor was working as a radio technician at the Montreal Forum in the late 1940s, he had been impressed when he heard Gallivan—who hailed from Nova Scotia and was then little known outside his native province—describe an amateur hockey match."

        "text": "The 2023–24 Bemidji State Beavers men's ice hockey season was the 68th season of play for the program, the 24th at the Division I level and 3rd in the CCHA. The Beavers represented Bemidji State University, played their home games at Sanford Center and were coached by Tom Serratore in his 23rd season.\nSeason.\nBemidji State's primary concern entering the season was how to replace four of their top five scorers from 2023. Though the leading scorer, Lleyton Roed, was back for his sophomore season, the Beavers would need the rest of the team to step up as well. With the offense still a work in progress, the team had trouble winning early in the season. The team was competitive in most of their games, playing three overtime matches in the first two weeks, but they were only able to win once. Once the team began its conference schedule, Bemidji's hopes were diminished when starting goaltender, Matias Scholl, suffered a lower body injury and was forced to miss several weeks. Though Gavin Enright stepped up against St. Thomas, he wasn't able to sustain that level of play and the team's goals against ballooned. \nDuring that time the offense began to figure itself out. Though they also lost Jackson Jutting for over 2 months due to injury, Bemidji State started seeing major contributions from new quarters. Several returning players posted new career highs and the Beavers were buoyed by the addition of Eric Pohlkamp. When Scholl returned The team was treading water but remained in the hunt for the conference title. He helped the team post a weekend sweep but because of the winter break, the Beavers weren't able to build on that momentum. Instead, Bemidji State lost four of five to kick off the second half of their season.\nAt the beginning of February, the team was 4 games under .500, however, because many of their losses were in non-conference games, the Beavers still had a good chance to get home ice in the first round of the conference tournament. However, over the final four weeks of the regular season, Bemidji State tore through its opposition. Scholl finally looked to have recovered from his injury while the offense found a consistency that had eluded them all season. The Beavers won eight games in a row (one in a shootout) and missed only two points in the standings. The streak sent BSU rocketing up the rankings and after they shutout Minnesota State in back-to-back games, the Beavers found themselves 9 points ahead of second place.\nBemidji State entered the postseason as one of the hottest teams in the country and they continued to roll over their competition. Though they got a slight scare from Ferris State in the first game, the Beavers swept their quarterfinal match and then easily dispatched Lake Superior State in the semifinals. With a conference championship their only path to the NCAA tournament, Bemidji State had even more to play for against Michigan Tech. Kasper Magnussen gave the team the lead in the first but after that the offense was unable to find the net. Despite firing 28 shots in the final two periods, no more scoring came from the Beavers. Tech was able to summon just enough scoring to take the lead and then held on for dear life thanks to a stellar performance from their goaltender.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "Oakdale Golf &amp; Country Club, founded in 1926, is a private, parkland-style golf and tennis club located in North York, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It hosted the 2023 Canadian Open and will host the tournament again in 2026.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded in 1926 and is located about 15 miles north of Toronto's downtown. The course was built on what was farmland decades before the metropolis of Toronto spread and absorbed the property within its limits. Traces of a village have been found on the club grounds, adjacent to the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail. Since its founding, the club has asked its members to give back to the community in one way or another.\nIn 1926 \"The Toronto Star\" ran a story with the headline: \"Hebrews buy farm; build golf course.\" The club is known as predominantly Jewish, as members of the Toronto Jewish community bought the land to establish a Jewish country club in response to antisemitism in Canada in the 1920s and 1930s that strictly excluded Jews from private golf clubs, including the Rosedale Golf Club. Mark Sadowski, former president of the club, said: It was out of necessity that this club came into being. A hundred years ago the world was a very different place, and there were clubs who would not allow Jewish people to join or even play. And it was the same in the medical community and other aspects of business. There were very clear 'no blacks, no Jews, and no Asians' rules. However, religion has never been a requirement or barrier to membership, and anyone can join the club, which includes many non-Jews.\nIt was selected as a new site for the 2023 Canadian Open tournament – the world’s third-oldest national championship – after Golf Canada realized that only a handful of Canadian Opens had been conducted within Toronto itself in the previous several decades. Nick Taylor won the 2023 tournament, becoming the first Canadian citizen to win the Canadian Open since 1954 and the first Canadian-born player to win the event since 1914. The 2026 Canadian Open will be played on the course as well.\nCourse.\nThe golf course has 27 holes, 18 designed by Canadian architect Stanley Thompson in the 1920s and 1930s. A third nine was designed by Canadian Golf Hall of Famer Robbie Robinson, a disciple of Thompson, in 1957. Black Creek runs through the course. Each of the three nines are named for famous figures in Canadian golf: Thompson himself, George Knudson (eight-time PGA Tour winner), and Wilf Homenuik (the club's longtime teaching pro). Knudson won 8 tournaments on the PGA tour, and Homenuik won several tournaments as an amateur and Canadian PGA events. Both men were also club professionals at Oakdale.\nThe June 2023 Canadian Open was played on a 7,460-yard composite routing that used some holes from each of the Homenuik and Thompson nines and all of the Knudson holes as the back nine. It was the first time the course was an RBC Canadian Open host venue. It was the 37th course in the tournament's 117-year history.\nFacilities.\nThe club's tennis facilities feature six outdoor courts, with pro shop and offers lessons and competitions."

        "text": "The 2023–24 Colgate Raiders Men's ice hockey season was the 94th season of play for the program and the 63rd in the ECAC Hockey conference. The Raiders represented Colgate University, played their home games at the Class of 1965 Arena and were coached by Mike Harder in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nAfter 30 seasons behind the bench for the Raiders, Don Vaughan retired following his first conference tournament championship. A few months later, the school decided to bring back former assistant and team captain Mike Harder as the program's 15th head coach. Harder began with a solid foundation as most of the team's roster returned, however, he would have to find a way to replace some missing offense. Three of the Raiders' top four scorers had departed, however, as Colgate was already one of the better offensive teams in the conference, they were well-positioned to handle that loss.\nThe team encountered difficulty early in the season but, surprisingly, it was the defense that appeared to be the culprit. Carter Gylander had an up-and-down start to his season and was unable to string together a consistent run of solid goaltending. With the offense still a work in progress, the team hovered around .500 for the first half of the season despite playing a relatively easy schedule.\nAfter returning from the winter break, the layoff of more than a month didn't appear to help the Raiders and they went winless in their first four games in January. With the season starting to spiral out of control, Colgate recovered against defending national champions Quinnipiac with a surprising 2–1 win in the middle of the month. That proved to be the turning point of the season as Gylander began looking like the starting goaltender that he was and returned to his 2023 form for the remainder of the season. The offense began to function as a cohesive unit in the second half as well. Though the Raiders didn't have the same top-end scoring they did in '23, the team had greater depth to its offense and ended the year averaging nearly half a goal per game better than it had the year before.\nColgate nearly ran through their conference schedule in the latter half of the year, ending the regular season on a 10–3–1 run. As the wins piled up, the Raiders shot up the conference standings. Though hey barely missed out on a 2nd-place finish, the Raiders not only received a bye into the quarterfinal round, but they would kick of the defense of their conference championship at home. When Colgate got back on the ice, they hit the ground running against St. Lawrence. The Raiders were by far the more aggressive team in the first but the Larries were kept in the game by a stellar performance from their goaltender. SLU took advantage of a lull by Colgate in the second to score 2 goals in quick succession but the Raiders were able to recover in the third. Tommy Bergsland had a hand in 2 markers for Colgate to even the score and force overtime. The offense continued to assault the Saints' net in extra time but they could not find the winning goal. It took until the middle of the second overtime for the game to be decided, however, a seemingly harmless shot from the point was not be picked up by Gylander and found its way into the goal. The rematch saw Colgate's offense provide a consistent barrage on the St. Lawrence cage but the opposing goaltender remained stout. Colgate opened the scoring but were again down when the third period began. Ryan McGuire's power play marker even the score but, less then three minutes later, SLU's surging offense netted the go-ahead goal and the Raiders were unable to respond. The final 10 minutes of the game passed without any further scoring and Colgate's season ended with a disappointing thud.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

The Bears represented Brown University, played their home games at the Meehan Auditorium and were coached by Brendan Whittet in his 14th season.\nSeason.\nBrown's season followed nearly the same path that it had in 2023. The Bears began poorly, losing six of their first nine due mostly to a weak offense. The goaltending dual that arose out of training camp was soon settled in favor of Lawton Zacher. However, in spite of stable goaltending, Brown was unable to capitalize on many resulting opportunities. In the first three months of the season, The Bears managed 3 goals in just four of fourteen games.\nWhen the team started the second half of its season, there was a mild uptick in scoring but that was enough to give the Bears four wins in six games. The mini-streak put Brown in the middle of the conference standings and had them briefly competing for a home site in the conference playoffs. Once February rolled around, all of those gains were washed away. The offense slept-walked through the rest of their schedule and Brown didn't win once in their final nine games. The losing skid sent the team plummeting to the bottom of the standings and they finished just a single point out of last place.\nThe postseason opened with Union getting off to a quick start and never looking back. Brown was badly outplayed by the Garnet Chargers in the first two periods and found themselves down by three goals entering the third. The Bears were forced to abandon their defensive structure to try and tie the game but all that did was give Union free reign to all to their lead. When the dust settled, Brown was on the wrong end of a 0–6 score and their lackluster season was over.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 1927–28 Colgate men's ice hockey season was the 5th season of play for the program. The team was coached by James Ballantine in his 3rd season.\nSeason.\nAfter a hiatus of 5 years, the Colgate athletic council voted to bring the ice hockey program back as a minor sport. Lt Col James Ballantine, who had been the head coach in the early 20s, agreed to held the club once more while J. Howard Starr, a former player at YMCA College, would serve as his assistant. About $400 was made available to the team with three quarters of that going to game-related expenses and the remaining fourth reserved for equipment costs.\nThe team began practicing in the Huntington Gymnasium while a temporary rink was built atop the freshman football field. The Maroons did what they could to get ready for their first game, however, the weather was not accommodating and forced the team to cancel or postpone several games in January. The lack of ice also forced the team to take their practices on Taylor Lake as some of the wrinkles with the new rink were being ironed out.\nBecause most of the early games were supposed to take place at home, the hockey team could only sit and wait for the weather to turn. However, in the end, the Maroons wouldn't play their first match until the beginning of February when they travelled to the north country. The opening match with St. Lawrence started badly for Colgate as the team surrendered two goals within the first few minutes. The Maroons settled down after that and slowly crawled back into the game. After tying the score in the second, Colgate found itself down by a goal heading into the third period. Just when it looked like overtime was a sure thing, the Larries scored to take their final lead of the game. The next evening the team was a short distance away facing down a very powerful Clarkson squad. The Maroons fought valiantly but they were clearly overmatched by the Golden Knights. Despite the disparity in play, Colgate only allowed 4 goals in the match which was a decent result for the inexperienced team.\nDue several more cancellations, Colgate did not play another game until the end of the month. Miraculously, the team's rink was usable for the rematch with Clarkson. Unfortunately, the time off had not been kind to the Maroons. Colgate's defense was no match for the stunning Clarkson offense. Chambers was under attack from the Knights all game and made several impressive saves but wasn't able to stop the puck from entering the cage nine times. A few days later a postponed match with Cornell was finally played and the Maroons gave everything they had to the Big Red. The defense was far better than it had been against Clarkson and held Cornell to just a single score in the middle frame. The offense generated several chances, however, nothing was able to find the back of the net and Colgate ended the season without a victory.\nCharles Fistere served as team manager with Paul Wish as his assistant.\nNote: Colgate's athletic teams did not have a moniker until 'Red Raiders' was adopted in 1932.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

Foley served as the head coach of the U.S. Snowboard team starting with when it was founded in 1994, including at three Olympics. In 2001, he was named USSS Coach of the Year, and in 2021 he was selected by USSS as Snowboard Coach of the Year. He was fired by USSS in March 2022, after sexual misconduct allegations were made. He had been the coach of the U.S. snowboarding team for 28 years. On August 8, 2023, SafeSport suspended him for ten years for sexual misconduct.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nFoley is the son of Terry Foley, a Bend, Oregon native, former alpine ski racer, and ski coach. He grew up as a ski racer in Colorado. He initially attended the University of Colorado Boulder, and then transferred to the University of Oregon, where he studied journalism. He began snowboarding in the early 1990s, and raced as a professional for two seasons. As of 2010 he lived in Mt. Hood, Oregon, and in 2014 with his wife and two children in Hood River, Oregon. He is also director of Product Development at Insight Replay, which he co-founded in 2013.\nTeam USA snowboard team head coach.\nFoley served as the head coach of the U.S. Snowboard team starting in 1994, when it was founded, including at three Olympics, through 2022. By 2022, he had led it to seven Olympic Games, at which team members won a combined 35 Olympic medals. Foley was in charge of seeding and deciding which athletes competed in World Cup competitions, in addition to the Olympic team. In 2001 he was named U.S. Ski &amp; Snowboard (USSS) Coach of the Year, and in 2021 he was selected by USSS as Snowboard Coach of the Year.\n2022; Safety plan, dismissal as coach, temporary suspension.\nIn February 2022 former USSS team member and 2010 Olympian Callan Chythlook-Sifsof made social posts on Instagram during the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics accusing Foley of sexual misconduct. She wrote: \"I cannot watch another Olympic Games without saying this publicly.\" Foley denied the allegations vehemently. USSS immediately implemented an \"athlete safety plan\" that prohibited Foley from having \"one-on-one interaction with female athletes,\" and from going into an athlete village. \nUSSS also immediately notified the U.S. Center for SafeSport, an organization authorized by the U.S. Congress to police reports related to sexual abuse in U.S. Olympic sports, upon learning of Chythlook-Sifsof’s Instagram post. But on February 16, SafeSport Center vice president Bobby Click emailed USSS that: \"based on the information the center has, we have chosen not to implement any types of measure.\" \nOn February 21, 2022, USSS placed Foley on a leave of absence. It fired him on March 20, 2022, days after the Beijing Olympics concluded. He had been coach of the U.S. snowboarding team for 28 years.\nIn March 2022, three former athletes and a former USSS employee also filed sexual misconduct complaints about Foley with SafeSport. A former USSS employee said that in 2008 Foley coerced her into taking nude photos, and then sexually assaulted her as she said no and tried to move away from him, and eventually rolled her over and ejaculated on her back. She alleged that he sexually assaulted her on two separate occasions. One former athlete said that she was asleep in a hotel room when Foley slid in behind her, reached his \"arm over my body and put his fingers inside me.” SafeSport temporarily suspended Foley on March 18, 2022, pending its investigation. The SafeSport temporary suspension was handed down over five weeks after the original Instagram post accusing Foley of sexual misconduct.\nUSSS said that it had reported the allegations to the United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee (USOPC), as well as to SafeSport.\n2023; lawsuits, and 10-year suspension.\nIn February 2023, Olympic bronze medalist Rosey Fletcher (parallel giant slalom) and other former USSS team members sued Foley, along with the national federation, its former CEO, and the USOPC, in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles for sex trafficking, harassment, and enabling and covering up repeated acts of sexual assault and misconduct, alleging that the defendants \"conspired and acted in concert with one another to commit unlawful acts.\" They alleged that Foley exploited his position of trust to \"coerce sexual acts through force, manipulation, emotional abuse, intimidation, and retaliation.\" Fletcher said that Foley sexually assaulted her at a U.S. team camp when she was 19, and again at a post-race event at the Olympics. Former national team member Erin O'Malley alleged that she was \"sexually assaulted and harassed ... by Foley, who exploited their unequal power dynamic.\" Foley and the other defendants asked the court to throw out the lawsuit; a hearing is set for October 2023.\nSeparately in February 2023, the former USSS employee who had previously filed a report with Safesport filed a lawsuit against Foley and others for the alleged sexual assaults.\nOn August 8, 2023, after an 18-month investigation, SafeSport suspended Foley for ten years for sexual misconduct."

        "text": "Anthony Gould (born April 6, 2001) is an American football wide receiver for the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Oregon State Beavers as a wide receiver and return specialist.\nGould was drafted into the NFL during the 2024 NFL draft, held in Detroit in April.\nEarly life and high school.\nGould was born and grew up in Leavenworth, Kansas. He attended West Salem High School in Salem, Oregon, where he played football. Gould caught 58 passes for 1,191 yards, and 12 touchdowns, while also being a threat on the ground rushing for 744 yards and seven touchdowns. Gould committed to play college football at Oregon State University.\nCollege career.\nIn Gould's first two seasons he played in eight games, only returning one punt for 14 yards. He would also redshirt in his first season after playing four games. However, in 2021 Gould would take a step up, and two weeks into the season he had a breakout game versus Hawaii. In the game he brought in seven receptions for 119 yards and his first career touchdown, as he helped the Beavers get their first win of the year. In week seven, Gould got his first rushing touchdown, as he took a sweep 14 yards for a touchdown in a 42–34 win over Utah. Gould finished the 2021 season with 13 receptions for 185 yards and a touchdown. \nGould had a breakout season in 2022. In the Beavers opening game Gould had a 74-yard reception to help set up a touchdown, and he finished the day with two receptions for 69 yards, as he helped the Beavers beat Boise State. In the next week Gould had another huge catch, this one going for 42 yards, and setting up a touchdown for Deshuan Fenwick, as Oregon State beat Fresno State on the final play of the game. \nGould would have the best game of his career in the following week against Montana State, as he hauled in five receptions for 77 yards and two touchdowns, along with an 80-yard punt return touchdown. In Week 11, Gould had another outstanding game hauling in two passes for 49 yards, but more importantly he took a punt return to the house for a 54-yard touchdown, his second punt return touchdown on the year. \nGould finished 2022 with 27 receptions for 457 yards and three touchdowns. For his performance on the year, Gould was named first team All Pac-12, and first-team All American, both as a punt returner.\nDuring the 2023 season, Gould played extensively as a wide receiver and a kick return specialist. He played 93% of his snaps from scrimmage as an outside receiver in 2023, as opposed to playing from the slot, and was regarded as one of the Pac-12's best deep threats. He finished the year with 44 receptions for 718 yards (16.3 yard per catch average) and scored two touchdowns for the Beavers. He also returned 7 punts for 113 yards.\nGould tallied a total score of 75 at the 2024 NFL Scouting Combine, ranking 19th among wide receivers who participated. His time of 4.39 seconds in the 40-yard dash was the 19th fastest among all Combine participants and his \"athleticism\" score of 91 was the fourth best among wide outs.\nProfessional career.\nGould was selected in the fifth round of the 2024 NFL draft by the Indianapolis Colts, who made him the 142nd player selected."

The team was coached by Paul Castner in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nNotre Dame began the season by building a temporary rink next to Badin Hall, then a men's dormitory. A warm winter, however, left the rink in a mostly unusable state and the team was forced to train on the frozen sections of St. Mary's Lake. The team wasn't able to form until mid-January when Paul Castner returned from a trip to Chicago with the necessary equipment such as sticks, pucks and pads.\nIn spite of all their problems, the team did manage to secure a pair of games against the Michigan College of Mines in early February. After three seasons and nearly a decade of trying, Notre Dame was finally able to play its first intercollegiate game of ice hockey. Short on both practice and experience, the Irish had few expectations for the team and that was born out in the first game, a 2–7 defeat. The players learned quickly, however, and the very next night saw Notre Dame defeat a college opponent for the first time when they evened the series with the Huskies. After returning home, the team received a rather surprising invitation from Carnegie Tech for a game in Pittsburgh. The Tartans themselves were just returning to the game after several years away and believed that a match with the Irish could help boost the profile of their team. Father Cunningham, who oversaw the team, accepted and Notre Dame travelled east for their third and final game of the year. The match allowed the Fighting Irish to establish another program first as they shutout Carnegie Tech and ended the year with a winning record.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1920–21 Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey season was the 4th season of play for the program. The Eagles were coached by Fred Rocque in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nBoston College received good news before the start of the season with the reconstruction of the Boston Arena continuing apace. Because it would not be quite ready for the start of the season, the university decided to build two temporary rinks on the football field and use those in the interim. Early on, team captain Leo Hughes acted as the team's coach while the Eagles awaited the hiring of a new bench boss. Several men were in the running, including last year's head coach Walter Falvey, however, the school eventually settled on the more experienced Fred Rocque. A big benefit to Rucque was that virtually the same team that had finished with an excellent record was returning. Garrity, Healey and Hughes were back as a threesome on the forward line while the Morrissey brothers were arranged on defense. McCloskey, Ed O'Brien and Urban were all available in goal while Curry would serve as the primary reserve.\nFor the first game, BC headed up to Maine to take on Bates. Because the Garnet still played 7-man hockey, Currey got to start the game at center while Hughes occupied the spot at rover. The change didn't seem to adversely affect the club since it was the Eagles who dominated the game from start to finish. Curry and Healey each scored a pair while Hughes picked up the other marker. The following week, Boston College was back to 6-man play when they took on MIT and appeared a bit slow at the start. Tech scored three goals in the first half of the game with only a single marker from Hughes for the Eagles. Momentum swung to BC in the second half, however, and the Eagles were able to score three goals in the final period and a half. Hughes finished the comeback with just minutes left in regulation to take the match.\nWhile the Eagles had attempted to schedule a Canadian college, no match was able to be played. Instead, the team took on one of Rocque's old clubs, Dartmouth. The Indians were undefeated entering the match and were expected to vie for the intercollegiate title, however, the Eagles were unimpressed by the Greens and sent them packing with a stunning shutout victory. Urban was solid in his first appearance of the season but the balance of play was carried by the BC skaters. The offense hemmed Dartmouth in their own end for much of the match while the defense limited the Greens to just 6 shots on goal. A second 2-goal game from Hughes led the way with some on the BC side calling him the next Hobey Baker.\nBC followed it hot start with a busy week to end January. The team was set to play 3 games in 6 days and kicked things off with a rematch against MIT. With both Urban and O'Brien unavailable, coach Rocque turned to McCluskey and the cold netminder played as best he could. Unfortunately, on the other end of the ice, the Engineer goaltender put up a stellar performance while facing nearly 50 shots. The BC offense was able to get 3 goals on the night but that was matched by Tech and overtime was needed to settle the game. In spite of the barrage from the forward unit, MIT's defense held and a fourth goal from the Engineers couldn't be answered before the final buzzer. Still smarting from the loss, the team returned to campus for the next game. With the Boston Arena being used, the Eagles staged a match with Amherst on Alumni Field. Rocque decided to insert Dan Murphy, a freshman, into the goal. Murphy had a little trouble getting to his game in the first part of the game and allowed two goals to the underpowered Lord Jeffs. By the second half, however, Murphy had grown accustomed to the college game and turned aside all further shots to help the Eagles get back into the win column. The team wrapped up the busy period with a return to the Arena and a meeting with Massachusetts Agricultural. Hughes was nursing a knee injury throughout the match and wasn't able to play his normal fast game, however, he was able to hang back and provide an extra layer of defense for the club. Frank Morrissey chipped in on offense in his stead and helped the team eke out a 2–1 win to end the month on a high note.\nUrban was back for the game against the Shoe Trades but the team was dealt a severe blow when Hughes was injured. The team's star player remained in the game but was a shadow of his former self and could hardly skate with a badly bruised knee and thigh. The lack of speed from the Eagles only helped the Traders but the biggest problem was Urban's inexperience with plays from behind the net. The BC goalie was time and again beaten when one of the opponents skated around the back of the cage and whipped the puck into the net. More than half of the Shoe Trades goals were scored in this manner, however, even without those markers the hamstrung Eagles would still have fallen to the Traders.\nThe team had long layoff afterwards and didn't play another game for more than 3 weeks. Even with the extended rest, Hughes was unable to play in the final game. The BC forwards played a tremendous game in his absence with Healey netting a hat-trick while Garrity potted two more. Curry played at center for the entire game and was superb on both ends of the ice, simultaneously breaking up MIT rushes and assisting on seemingly every Eagle goal.\nHenry McInerney served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1926–27 Massachusetts Agricultural Aggies men's ice hockey season was the 19th season of play for the program. The Aggies were coached by Lorin Ball in his 3rd season.\nSeason.\nBefore the start of the season, MAC was engaged by several other New England schools about the possibility of joining a new conference. Plans for the New England Intercollegiate Hockey League began after the completion of the Rhode Island Auditorium that allowed both Brown and Providence access to consistent ice for the first time. The prospective teams were planning on holding all conference games at either the Auditorium, the Boston Arena, or the Big E Coliseum, which had just recently been converted to allow for ice hockey. While the invitation was tempting, the Aggies decided against joining the conference in 1927 as they already had a 12-game schedule arranged. With their season outlined by early December, the 20 or so candidates for the team met and began off-ice training.\nWith all three groups losing starters (forward, defense and goalie) the team would have to be rebuilt by coach Ball, but he was still a relative novice in the sport. The Aggies would have to rely on team captain Joe Forest all the more to pull them out of a scoring drought that had plagued them all of last season. One bit of good news was that the weather seemed to be accommodating, at least to begin the new year. The players returned from the winter break early to get as much training in as possible prior to the first game. The team was formed around returning lettermen Forest, Abrahamson and Frese with each moving around the lineup to find the best position. The training seemed to be working when the team hit the ice in mid-January for the first match with Bates. Both squads were defensive stalwarts and that play was mostly even throughout the game. Ducky Swan got the Aggies on the board after a slow start but the Garnet defense stiffened afterwards. Bates knotted the score at the start of the second but no more goals were forthcoming. Several penalties were called in the third but neither team could take advantage and regulation ended with the score even. The first 5-minute overtime was unable to settle things so a second session was needed. In a brilliant individual effort, Forest skated through the Bobcats and fired home the winning goal to start the team's season in style.\nThe following week the team set out for a 3-game trip through New York. Unfortunately, the weather had turned and two games were cancelled. The only match the team was able to play came against Hamilton, who used an indoor rink. After a scoreless first period, Hamilton jumped out to a 2-goal lead in the second. Swan cut the lead in half in the third but the Aggies couldn't get a second and fell by a narrow margin. Aside from the loss, the team was bit by the injury bug; Forest was hit in the face with a high stick and had a badly swollen lip while Abrahamson tweaked his knee. Both players were expected to be available for the trip up to Maine the following week. Before their sojourn north, MAC returned home for a match with Amherst. Warm weather forced the game to be played on the campus pond that was played at a fast pace in spite of the ice conditions. Due to an infected lip, Forest was forced to miss the game and his absence had a damaging impact on the Aggie offense. The Lord Jeffs got on the board first and then played a very physical brand of hockey afterwards. One of the Purple wingers received a 3-minute penalty for hitting Galanie in the head with a stick and the rest of the Sabrinas were so oft sent to the box that, at one point, there were only two Amherst players on the ice (one skater and the goalie). The Aggies, much to their chagrin, could not get anything into the Amherst cage. Currier, the Jeffs' netminder, was absolutely perfect in the match and shut down the anemic MAC offense.\nForest was still out when the team headed up to take on Colby. MAC could not generate any offense without their captain and were frustrated by the Muled who employed nearly twice as many players in the game as the Aggies. The rematch with Bates saw much of the same, however, poor ice conditions curtailed any attempts at offense. With puddles littering the ice, the game was slowed to a crawl and neither team managed to score. Even after two overtime sessions the scoresheet remained empty and the match was called.\nMAC went on its third and final road trip at the start of February and tried to escape the poor ice conditions in Vermont. Forest had sufficiently recovered in time and was back with the team on the trip. Unfortunately, both he and the offense were out of sorts in the first game when they took on Middlebury. The Panthers stifling defense game no room to the Aggies and the team was unable to score for the fourth consecutive game, a level of offensive ineptitude that had never been matched. Fortunately, the team was finally able to get the puck into the net the following night against Vermont. Cook and Frese each tallied in the game to give MAC its second win of the year and hopefully turn around their season.\nThe Aggies were scheduled to play four more games in February, however, the warm weather had not abated in the interim. With no ice on which to play games, let alone practice, the athletic department decided to cancel the remainder of the season. MAC had played just 7 out of a scheduled 13 games when the season was abruptly ended.\nAndrew Anderson served as team manager with James Cunningham as his assistant.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1904–05 Oregon Agricultural Aggies women's basketball team represented Oregon Agricultural College (OAC, today's Oregon State University) during the 1904–05 academic year. It was the seventh academic year in which an organized women's team played games on behalf of OAC.\nThe team was independent of any organized athletic conference and scheduled its games on an ad hoc basis. The team played a game in January 1905 reckoned by one local newspaper to be the largest crowd to ever see a basketball game in the history of OAC.\nBased upon newspaper accounts, the 1904–05 OAC team ended with a record of 6 wins and 2 losses, losing to neighboring Albany College in a state championship game held in Portland in March.\nTeam history.\nDecember 1904.\nIn December 1904, the OAC women's basketball team traveled to Southern Oregon to play a back-to-back pair of games. On Friday, December 16, the team played in Cottage Grove, where they won by a score of 13 to 7. The following night the team took the floor against a badly overmatched Roseburg team, whom they drubbed by the lopsided score of 42–5.\nJanuary 1905.\nOn Friday, January 20, 1905, the Aggies faced off against the Lebanon High School girls team in front of a large crowd at the OAC Armory. A local news account noted that this event marked the first appearance of the OAC women's squad in the armory in two years, which generated a higher-than-anticipated level of interest. OAC dominated the contest, taking a 12–2 lead into halftime en route to a 25–5 victory. About 400 fans were in attendance to the see the victory over the Lebanon girls — a crowd reckoned by the local press as \"probably the largest that ever attended a basket ball game at the college.\"\nFebruary 1905.\nOn February 11, the OAC women defeated a girls' team from the Chemawa Indian School, a boarding high school for Native American students located in Salem. Once again a \"large crowd\" was in attendance at the OAC Armory to see the Aggies take down the visitors by a score of 16 to 6. Students from neighboring Albany were in attendance and two home-and-home games were hastily organized between the Albany women and OAC.\nThe first game of the home-and-home battle against Albany College, known today as Lewis &amp; Clark College, took place at OAC Armory on Thursday, February 16. Fully 100 people made the trip from Albany to see the contest, with a sizeable Corvallis contingent also turning out to make the crowd \"a good one.\" The Aggies women won by the narrow score of 4 to 3. One local newspaper remarked for its readers that \"the teams were so evenly matched that scoring was impossible. This fact made it certain from the opening of play that a bit of good luck might throw the result either way, and every movement of the ball was watched with almost breathless interest.\"\nThe game opened with Albany making a free throw on a foul to open up a 1–0 lead, in what would prove to be Albany's only lead of the night. OAC answered a minute or two later making a foul shot of their own to tie the score. \"Then for a while the ball surged back and forth from one goal to the other, with honors fairly even\" until OAC captain Mertie Harrington made a basket from the field, enabling OAC to take a 3 to 1 halftime lead. Albany guard Gertrude Bussard hit a shot to tie the score in the second half — and \"the interest, which had all along been at high pitch, now assumed a tension seldom seen,\" a commentator remarked. A late foul shot was rolled in by OAC, sealing the narrow 4–3 victory.\nA game against Willamette University was scheduled for the OAC Armory on the following night, Friday, February 17. The contest was won by the OAC women by a score of 9 to 5, with the Aggies' scoring powered by three field goals by center Una Stewart and a bucket by forward Edna Smith. The night was shared with the OAC men's team, who demolished their Willamette counterparts by a score of 22 to 3. \"The crowd in attendance was the largest of the season, which by the way has been a season of unprecedented basket ball crowds. The receipts of Friday nights game was above $125,\" one local newspaper approvingly noted.\nA special train leaving Corvallis at 6:30 pm was arranged for local fans interested in making the trip to neighboring Albany for the rematch against Albany College on Saturday night, February 25. Two of the OAC regulars were ill and their places filled by substitutes. In the game at the Albany Armory, played before a packed house, the home team took a 10–5 lead to halftime, en route to an 18–13 victory over OAC. A third and deciding game between the two top teams in the state was planned to be held on a neutral court in Portland. The winner of the \"rubber\" was to be proclaimed as Oregon state women's basketball champions.\nMarch 1905.\nAfter a bit of wrangling between the two sides, the Portland YMCA was chosen as the neutral site and March 10 as the date for the deciding third game between Albany College and Oregon Agricultural College in what was reckoned as the Oregon state championship of women's basketball. A pair of neutral officials were decided upon by the respective managers of the teams, neither of which would have a personal interest in the outcome.\nThe game began at 6:00 pm. A large crowd was in attendance, including a number of former residents of Albany.\nThe orange-and-black took a 9 to 5 lead to halftime, but in the second half Albany College star guard Gertie Bussard got hot and pulled out the victory, with Albany outscoring OAC 15 to 5 in the period en route to a 20–14 victory. Bussard was clearly the player of the game, finishing with three field goals and six makes from the free throw line, accounting for more than half of Albany's scoring in the winning effort.\nRoster.\nAccording to the local press the following were members of the 1904–05 OAC women's team:\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| 1904–05 Season"

As did many college teams at the time, Bates was in the process of switching from a 7-player team to a 6-player team as the position of rover was being abolished, though they did play with the extra man during the season. Bates' first game came against Boston College and the team looked lost against the Bostonian outfit. Bates was whipped 0–5 by their more experienced and better supplied opponents but didn't let the loss scuttle their season. The next week, after addressing some of their issues, the team looked much better against an amateur outfit from Berlin. The defense showed up well and didn't allow a single goal to the men from New Hampshire. The only problem what that Bates couldn't score either. Even after 2 overtime periods the scoresheet remained empty. Captain Cutler won a coin toss and decided to extend the game by two additional 10-minute periods and the gamble paid off. Cutler scored the only goal of the match in the third extra period and the defense held for the remainder of time to give the program its first ever win. Two days later, Cutler scored a pair of goal en route to the team's second win and first over local rival Bowdoin.\nBates continued to roll with a 10–0 win over the St. Dominique team from Lewiston. Many substitutions were used in the game and allowed the regulars to play out of place. Wiggin, the regular goaltender for Bates, got a spell at wing and managed to score one of the team's goals. Bates suffered a setback in their next game and got swamped by the Portland Country Club and then lost the rematch with Berlin in overtime. Despite being without Cutler in the Bowdoin rematch, Bates was able to defeat the Bears once more. In the final game of the season, Bates played under the old rules with two 20-minute periods but still made it a close game. Still without Cutler, the team had trouble scoring and had to rely on acting captain Wiggin in goal. While they ultimately lost the game, Bates was still lauded for putting up a solid performance.\nLeroy Gross served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

These three-game test series were the primary event of the tours and would often be their own competition, the most famous being The Ashes. More modern tours have often skipped non-test matches but have still seen other test match been played outside of the primary event. Tours in rugby league were the main form of international competition before the Rugby League World Cup.\nWomen's tours.\nWomen's tours have operated very similar to men's tours, however many women's tours have seen a two-test series instead of the three-test series common with men's tours."

NCAA Champion Cravont Charleston didn't get out of the heats. Olympic Champion Marcell Jacobs and defending champion Fred Kerley didn't make the final. Meanwhile, 200 metre defending champion Noah Lyles claimed to be in pursuit of three gold medals, even though he had only finished third at the US Championships. Oblique Seville produced the fastest time through the rounds with his 9.86 in the heats.\nIn the final, fast starting 2019 champion Christian Coleman lived up to his reputation, getting out fastest, slightly ahead of U20 Champion Letsile Tebogo and Ryiem Forde. By the halfway point, Coleman had a metre and a half on the next group of Seville, Lyles and Zharnel Hughes, but the three were closing. Over the next 30 metres, Lyles gained a slight edge on Hughes and Seville, pulling even with Coleman and Tebogo. Over the final 20 metres, Lyles continued to increase the narrow gap while Coleman drifted out the back. Lyles crossed the finish as a clear winner, with Tebogo, Hughes and Seville hitting the line together. The photo finish revealed Tebogo in second, one one thousandth ahead of Hughes for bronze with Seville only three thousandths behind him. Tebogo's version of 9.88 improved on his own Botswana national record for the seventh time; his silver medal was the first won by an African man in the 100m at the world championships.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 10.00 seconds.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+2), is as follows:\nResults.\nPreliminary round.\nThe preliminary round took place on 19 August, with the 33 athletes involved being split into three heats of eight athletes each, and one of nine athletes.

Andrew Hudson received minor injuries with broken glass getting into his eye. The first semi was moved to last in the order to give Hudson and the other athletes a chance to recover. A relaxed defending champion Noah Lyles came through as the #1 qualifier. Hudson finished fourth in the semi, but was granted the extra lane in the final.\nIn the final, the start was fairly even, with the exception of Joseph Fahnbulleh's notoriously slow start, accentuated by Hudson's fast start in lane 1 next to him. As they were beginning to exit the turn, the three Americans, Lyles, Erriyon Knighton, and Kenny Bednarek, along with Letsile Tebogo all on the outside of the tracking Zharnel Hughes, were still even. With Lyles' notorious closing speed, that was bad news for the other competitors. From there, true to form, Lyles opened a gap that continued to widen to the finish. The next two runners to gain separation were the youngsters, 19 year old Knighton, then 20 year old Tebogo. Lyles had 3 metres over Knighton at the finish. Knighton was barely a metre clear of Tebogo. Lyles' 19.52 winning time equalled the #14 time in history, tied with two previous efforts from Lyles (but he's also run faster on four other occasions). Knighton's 19.75 means he owns all of the top 12 times ever run by a U20 athlete.

Because the school delayed the decision, the team had only a short time to arrange a schedule and ended up playing Bowdoin in four of their seven games. In spite of the hasty arrangement, Bates played a local aggregation first and won their opening match 3–0. Bates then tortured Bowdoin with a pair of dominant performances. After Sauvage netted a hat-trick in the first meeting, Provost posted 6 goals in the rematch. In between those matches, the team suffered its first loss of the year in overtime. The first road game for the team was a fast match that needed three separate 5-minute overtimes to decide but a shot that deflected off of captain Burns' stick past Wiggin doomed the garnet skaters.\nThe rematch with Portland went about as well as the first while an amateur team from Canada, called the Nibrocks of La Tuque, arrived in early February and handed the team another loss. While Bates was able to keep up with the foreigners in the game, the lack of teamwork allowed the Canadians to block any offense the team managed to put together. Bates then ended its season by splitting a pair of games with Bowdoin during the winter carnival. The score of the each match was 1–0 with Bates taking the first before seeing the Bears finally win one of their own.

O'Sullivan led Zhang 2–1, but Zhang responded with breaks of 97, 50, and 116 to win 4–2. Disturbed by people moving in the crowd, O'Sullivan complained to referee Ben Williams that it felt as if a sponsored walk was taking place at the venue. He bit the tip off his cue at the end of the match and left it on the floor of the arena. Higgins defeated Lines 4–1, making the tournament's highest break of 145 in the opening frame and following it with breaks of 71, 91, and 132.

Williams's winning streak ended when he lost 3–4 to Liu in a match that started after 23:00 BST and finished shortly before 01:30 BST on 6 October. Williams complained on social media about the match's late start time, calling it \"crazy\" and asking how players could be expected to perform well at that hour.\nLater rounds.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played on 6 October as best of nine frames. All quarter-finalists in the bottom half of the draw were Chinese players. Trump won the 30-minute first frame against Selt, but his opponent tied the scores at 1–1.

Higgins made five half-century breaks as he defeated O'Donnell, also by a 5–1 scoreline. Liu won the first three frames against 15th seed Ding, and led 3–1 and 4–2. In the seventh frame, Ding had a 56-point lead, but twice missed pots that would have left Liu requiring snookers. Liu made a 57 clearance to win the match 5–2 and reach his first ranking semi-final. Zhang played Zhou in a match that produced two centuries (both by Zhou) and six other half-centuries. Zhang clinched a 5–4 victory with an 80 break in the deciding frame. He also reached the first ranking semi-final of his 14-year professional career, his previous best performance having been a quarter-final place.\nSemi finals.\nThe semi-finals were played on 7 October as best of 11 frames. Higgins competed in his 82nd ranking semi-final, while Trump contested his 55th. Higgins won the opening frame with a 124 break, but Trump won the second on the colours after Higgins made a safety error on the blue. Higgins made breaks of 53 and 137 to lead 3–1 at the mid-session interval, and also won frame five. Trump won the sixth after the brown while escaping from a snooker, but Higgins went 5–2 ahead with a 77 break. Higgins had a chance to clinch the match in frame eight, but missed the yellow to a and Trump cleared to the pink. Trump then made breaks of 88 and 111 to tie the scores at 5–5. A 68 break helped Trump win the decider for a 6–5 victory. \"Early in the game I was tense and trying too hard, then from 5–2 I changed my mindset and relaxed\", Trump commented. He also stated that support from the crowd when he was 4–5 behind \"inspired me to put on a show for them\". \nIn the other semi-final, Zhang played Liu. Zhang trailed by 46 points in the opening frame, but won it with a 59 clearance. He also won the next three frames to go 4–0 ahead at the mid-session interval. Liu won frame five after Zhang missed a pot on the last red, but Zhang made a 52 break in the sixth to go 5–1 ahead. Liu made a 68 break to win the seventh, but Zhang clinched a 6–2 win with breaks of 31 and 46 in frame eight. \"I’m not feeling surprised, this wasn’t unexpected for me\", commented Zhang about reaching the final. He added: \"This is what I have been trying to achieve for years and I’ve put in a lot of effort\".\nFinal.\nThe final was played on 8 October as best of 17 frames between fifth seed Trump and world number 57 Zhang. Zhang was competing in his first ranking final, while Trump was contesting his 39th. The first two frames were shared, but Trump scored just one point in the next three frames as Zhang made breaks including 85 and 128 to lead 4–1. Trump miscued in the sixth frame while attempting a pot on a red, and Zhang extended his lead to 5–1. However, Trump won the last two frames of the afternoon session with breaks of 56 and 120, reducing Zhang's lead to two frames at 5–3. Between sessions, Trump had tournament director Paul Collier replace his cue tip and remained at the venue practicing with it rather than returning to his hotel. \nZhang began the evening session with breaks of 109 and 98 to lead 7–3. He had a chance to win frame 11, but missed a pot on the blue to the middle pocket. Trump then won six consecutive frames, including a 135 total clearance in frame 12, to win the match 9–7 and secure his second English Open title, having previously won the tournament in 2020. It was Trump's fifth win at a Home Nations Series event, his 24th ranking title, and his first win at a ranking event since the 2022 Turkish Masters 19 months previously. \"I was up against it the whole day\", commented Trump afterwards. \"In the end I managed to find some momentum and clawed it back. Zhang played well until 7–3 and put me under a lot of pressure, it was only when he missed a couple that I started to turn it round\". \"When I was 7–3 up I missed a blue in the middle pocket and Judd came back like a monster\", said Zhang. Despite his loss in the final, Zhang received £35,000 as runner-up, the biggest prize of his career to date, and advanced from number 57 to number 40 in the world rankings.\nMain draw.\nThe draw for the tournament is shown below.

        "text": "The 2023–24 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team represented the University of California, Los Angeles during the 2023–24 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Bruins were led by fifth-year head coach Mick Cronin, and they played their home games at Pauley Pavilion as a member of the Pac-12 Conference. It was the Bruins' final season as a member of the Pac-12 before joining the Big Ten Conference on July 1, 2024.\nUCLA had seven freshmen on their roster, and eight newcomers overall, along with three sophomores. The Bruins won their first three games and started the season 5–2. The team was limited offensively. On January 11, 2024, they lost 90–44 to Utah for their eighth loss in nine games. The 46-point defeat was the second-worst in the program's history, behind a 48-point loss (109–61) to Stanford in 1997. On January 27, UCLA defeated USC 65–50 at the Galen Center. It was the Bruins' first win in their crosstown rivalry under Cronin on the Trojans' home court, ending a five-game losing streak at the site. For the first time since 2004, the teams faced each other both with losing records. UCLA beat Oregon 71–63, dropping the Ducks to second place, for their third straight win and fifth in their last six games. They extended their winning streak to six games, and had won eight of their last nine, leading up to their rematch against Utah. However, the Bruins lost 70–69 to the Utes on a last-second basket. They also lost their following game to USC to fall to 14–13 overall and 9–7 in the conference, needing to win the Pac-12 tournament to advance to the NCAA tournament. UCLA lost their third game in a row, dropping back to .500 after allowing a season high in points in a 94–77 defeat to Washington. The Bruins won their regular-season finale 59–47 at home against Arizona State to end a five-game losing streak, including three at Pauley Pavilion.\nIn their Pac-12 tournament opener, Dylan Andrews scored a career-high 31 points to lead No. 5-seed UCLA to a 67–57 win over 12th-seeded Oregon State. The Bruins were eliminated in the following game in the quarterfinals, losing 68–66 to No. 4-seed Oregon. With 4.4 seconds remaining, Andrews took the inbounds pass, drove downcourt, and shot a floater inside the free throw line over N'Faly Dante as the buzzer sounded, but the ball bounced off the back of the rim. He ended the game with 24 points, and averaged 21.2 points over the final six games. Cronin's personal streak of 12 consecutive NCAA tournament appearances ended.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| Pac-12 regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| "

        "title": "1926–27 Yale Bulldogs men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1926–27 Yale Bulldogs men's ice hockey season was the 32nd season of play for the program. The Bulldogs represented Yale University and were coached by Clarence Wanamaker in his 6th season.\nSeason.\nBefore the team collected for its first meeting in early December, the program had already received news of two very positive developments. First, thanks to the efforts of Abraham Podoloff, the rebuild of the New Haven Arena was set to be finished in January and the school reached an agreement to rent the facility for four months out of the year for a 16-year period. Secondly, and perhaps more surprisingly, Yale University had decided to finally promote the men's ice hockey program to 'major' status in the athletic department. Aside from the prestige that this carried, the school was not fully committed to supporting the team which included a sizable increase in its operating budget. Before those changes took effect, however, the team had to shake off the rust and used both the Eastern States Coliseum and Hobey Baker Memorial Rink as practice venues in December. Because the team was hampered by a lack of practice time last season, the Elis decided against a heavy schedule over the winter break and would instead devote more time to training. This meant that the team would remain in the area over the holidays and played just 3 games during the vacation.\nThe Bulldogs needed the extra practice time as most of the team's started had graduated. John Frey and team captain Lawrence Noble were the only returning starters, though several had seen extra playing time due to injuries last year. Even with a new lineup, Yale was still able to get off to a good start in the season opener against McGill as Frey recorded the first goal of the season. Unfortunately, the Elis were unable to get another goal past the Red goalie. The Canadians picked up the pace in the second and started firing at the Yale cage. One of those pucks caught Richard Hurd in a vulnerable spot and injured the netminder. McGill ended up with 4 goals in the second half while Yale couldn't add to its total and dropped the match. A few days later, the Elis headed up to Springfield and got a tough test from MIT. With Wheelock now in goal, the Elis were able to rely on the more experienced goaltender to turn away several shots from the Engineers. He kept MIT off the scoresheet long enough for Frey's goal in the second period to give the team a lead. After their opponents rallied to tie the game in the third, the two agreed to play a 10-minute overtime period and gave Noble the time needed to score twice and give the Elis a lead they would not relinquish. MIT scored just as the extra time was coming to a close but that didn't stop Yale from posting its first win of the season. A week later, the team met Notre Dame for the first time on the ice and welcomed the visitors with a 5–0 victory. Noble was the star of the game and the score would have been even more lopsided if it weren't for the stellar play of the Irish netminder.\nAfter that solid start, Yale was able to practice at the New Haven Arena after it finally reopened. They were able to use the extra ice time to great advantage over Brown, who were playing their first game in over 20 years. Expectedly, the Elis dominated the match and kept their winning streak alive with a 8–1 win. While the match was played with 15-minute periods, it was also notable for coach Wanamaker swapping Frey and Vaughan, with the former moving to center, and starting Robinson at left wing, who went on to record a hat-trick. The next game saw the team post an even more impressive victory when they took down Princeton 9–1. Noble and Vaughan were key in staking the team to a 3–0 lead just 6 minutes into the game while both were able to complete hat-tricks before the end of the second. The win not only put Yale into contention for a collegiate title but it avenged the season sweep at the hands of the Tigers the year before.\nYale was finally able to play a true home game when they met the St. Nicholas Hockey Club in mid January. They faced off against one of the best amateur teams in the country who were led by former star Bulldog, Alston Jenkins, in goal. In front of 2,500 fans, the Elis' former captain held the Bulldogs back and stopped them from completing a dramatic comeback, handing Yale a 2–3 defeat. Undaunted, the team rebounded with a strong performance against Boston University the following night. Led by a hat-trick from Vaughan, the Elis kept their record against collegiate opponents spotless and move them closer to a title. For their third game in 5 days, the team got a tough fight from Dartmouth. With a crowd of 3,500 supporters to cheer them on, the Elis and Indians battled through stingy defenses and were each only able to score a single goal. Outstanding goaltending was the rule for the day while goals from Vaughan and Noble were called on due to offsides. Hurd was the surprising starter in goal but only surrendered one marker to Dartmouth star, Myles Lane. Both teams appeared tired in the first two 10-minute overtime sessions but rallied for a furious 3rd extra period. However, after neither was able to score, the game was called a draw and both teamed looked forward to the rematch to settle things.\nThe team had some time off before their next match due to the exam break and didn't play again until February. They returned against the University Club of Boston, an aggregation of 13 amateur players who were vying to represent the United States at the next Winter Olympics. The team showed just how good it was by throttling Yale 1–7 with a collection of former college all-stars. Luckily, the Elis lost no standing by responding with a 7–2 win over Williams in a fairly slow match. Noble led the way with his second hat-trick of the season. A few days later the team headed up to Hanover for the return match with the Greens and, once again, Yale and Dartmouth were the equal of each other. With Ryan replacing Manville on the blueline, the game was close throughout. Yale got into the lead in the third period and held it until the final minute when Lane broke through the Bulldog defense to tie the score. Another long overtime was required, however, this time Dartmouth was able to get the game-winner near the end of the second extra session and take the season series.\nWith their championship aspirations suffering a mortal blow, the Elis responded with an overpowering performance against Syracuse, routing the Orangemen 18–1. Even with Noble out of the lineup, Vaughan led the way with 7 goals while Ryan added 4 as the Elis seemingly kept the puck in the Syracuse end for the entire game. Noble was back when the team met St. Nicholas for a rematch but, again, former captain Jenkins was the star of the show. The Elis used the unusual tactic of three defensemen and two forwards to break up the attack from the amateurs but were still able to get 4 goals of their own. Unfortunately, their ploy wasn't as effective as they would have liked and Yale came up short by a goal for the second time that season.\nYale didn't have any time to mull over its missed opportunities as the very next game was against arch-rival Harvard. Even though the Bulldogs wouldn't be able to win an intercollegiate title due to the loss to Dartmouth, the team could still play spoiler and stop the Crimson from winning the championship. Unfortunately, the huge crowd at the Boston Arena were rewarded with a dominant performance by the home town team. Harvard scored 4 goals in the first and then put the game on cruise control. Yale slowly clawed back with a pair of goals by the beginning of the third, however, as soon as there was any danger, the Crimson netted another pair of markers to take the game comfortably. The rematch with Princeton came just a few days later and the Elis found themselves in a tough battle. Despite losing their star player, Davis, early in the match, the Tigers kept close to the Bulldogs for the first two periods. The game was broken open in the third when Yale scored 5 times and ran away with the game. While Vaughan and Frey were the stars of the night, the game also saw Alden Warner play his first full game in goal. With Yale down to its final game of the season, they welcomed Harvard to New Haven and were hoping for a much better outcome against the Crimson. In front of a full arena, Yale attacked the Harvard cage time and time again, only to see Joe Morrill turn everything aside. Noble and Frey were in top form throughout the game as both were playing in their final match for the Bulldogs but the Crimson defense was just too strong. Harvard opened the scoring in the second half with a long shot from center ice that slipped through Warner and dribbled into the cage. Four minutes later, a strong shot from Tudor raised Harvard's lead to two. Noble was able to cut the lead in half with about 4 minutes left in the third but the Elis were unable to get the tying marker and could only watch as Harvard completed an undefeated season to capture another intercollegiate championship.\nG. H. Walker Jr. served as team manager with J. Curtis as his assistant.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#00356B\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nScoring statistics.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 2023–24 EuroCup Basketball season was the 22nd season of Euroleague Basketball's secondary level professional club basketball tournament. It was the 16th season since it was renamed from the ULEB Cup to the EuroCup, and the first season under the new title sponsorship name of BKT The season began on 3 October 2023 and will end at the latest on 17 April 2024 with the Finals.\nDreamland Gran Canaria were the defending champions after refusing to take part in the 2023–24 EuroLeague via spot granted to the title holders, but were eliminated in eighthfinals.\nParis Basketball swept Mincidelice JL Bourg to achieve its first continental crown by winning its first EuroCup title in an almost perfect season with 22 wins and only one loss balance that earned it the right to secure a spot in the 2024–25 EuroLeague. It was also the second French side to win the EuroCup after AS Monaco triumph in the 2020–21 season.\nFormat changes.\nThe format changes consisted of reformatting the Playoffs. Access to the stage has been reduced with only six teams per group qualifying instead of eight, with the top two from each group bypassing the Eighthfinals and proceeding directly to the Quarterfinals. Furthermore, the Semifinals and Finals have been switched back to a best-of-three series format, returning to it after two seasons.\nTeam allocation.\nA total of 20 teams from 14 countries participatedin the 2023–24 EuroCup season. On June 29, 2023, Euroleague Basketball confirmed the team list for this season. Three new teams joined the competition and Wolves will make their debut appearance.\nTeams.\nLeague positions after playoffs of the previous season shown in parentheses (TH: EuroCup title holders).\nRound and draw dates.\nThe schedule of the competition was as follows.\nDraw.\nThe draw was held on 7 July 2023 in Barcelona, Spain.\nThe 20 teams were drawn into two groups of 10, with the restriction that teams from the same league could not be drawn against each other, except when there were more than two teams from the same league participating in the regular season. For the draw, the teams were seeded into 10 pots, in accordance with the Club Ranking, based on their performance in European competitions during a three-year period and the lowest possible position that any club from that league can occupy in the draw is calculated by adding the results of the worst performing team from each league.\nThe fixtures were decided after the draw, using a computer draw not shown to public, with the following match sequence:\n\"Note: Positions for scheduling do not use the seeding pots, e.g., Team 1 is not necessarily the team from Pot 1 in the draw.\"\nThere were scheduling restrictions: for example, teams from the same city in general were not scheduled to play at home on the same round (to avoid them playing at home on the same day or on consecutive days, due to logistics and crowd control).\nRegular season.\nThe regular season started on 3 October 2023 and ended on 7 February 2024. In each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format where only six teams advanced to the playoffs. Moreover, the top two teams in each regular season group received first round playoff byes, skipping the eighthfinals to be placed directly into the quarterfinals. At the tail end of the standings, four teams from each group were eliminated after the regular season. Alongside 17 returning teams from last season, Wolves made its debut appearance, and Aris Midea and Beşiktaş Emlakjet welcomed back to the EuroCup eight years later.\nPlayoffs.\nIn the playoffs, teams played against each other in a knockout tournament into four rounds from eighthfinals to finals. At the end of the regular season, the six teams from each group with the most wins qualified for the playoffs. The two top teams from each regular season group received a bye and qualified directly to the quarterfinals. The remaining eight qualified teams entered the eighthfinals to compete in a single-game format in which the third-placed teams of each group faced off against the sixth-placed teams of the opposite groups and the fourth-placed teams of each group faced off against the fifth-placed teams of the opposite groups. The four winning teams from eighthfinals entered the quarterfinals to faced off in a single-game format in the home of the two top teams from each regular season group. The higher-placed regular season team in each matchup enjoyed home court advantage in eighthfinals and quarterfinals. From semifinals onwards, teams played in best-of-three series with the first leg and third leg, if necessary, in the home court of the higher-placed regular season team to crown the EuroCup champion.\nEighthfinals.\nThe eighthfinals were played on 5–6 March 2024.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe quarterfinals were played on 12–14 March 2024.\nSemifinals.\nThe first legs were played on 26 March, the second legs on 29 March and the third legs on 3 April 2024, if necessary. \nFinals.\nThe first leg was played on 9 April, the second leg on 12 April."

        "title": "List of 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup controversies",
        "text": "There were various controversies relating to the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup; such issues predominantly saw figures within women's football negatively responding to decisions undertaken by FIFA, the world governing body of football, as well as players from several nations taking collective action against their national football associations. Concerns were particularly raised where decisions would clash with LGBT+ rights, something FIFA have acknowledged women's footballers are passionate about, as well as on player welfare and pay. There were also other team-specific issues.\nWomen's football journalist Suzanne Wrack noted that the types of controversial issues at the Women's World Cup were different to those of the Men's World Cup, and were mainly issues related to the gender gap in professionalism of football; she opined that the 2023 Women's World Cup and the controversies surrounding it were deeply connected, that the on-pitch performances would reflect the progress, or not, made with the off-pitch issues, a situation she described as \"fascinating\". Sky Sports noted the breadth of the issues, that similar issues affected teams with different backgrounds from all over the world, even if there was greater focus on the \"star-heavy\" European teams. Some of these issues becoming public controversies ahead of the Women's World Cup was attributed to women's players being vocal about their concerns, due to typically having to advocate for themselves in the sport, with TIME explaining that \"female players, it seems, never have the luxury of just sticking to sports\".\nHosting and organisation.\nEngland host bid vote.\nAfter the 2020 vote on which bid would be awarded hosting rights to the 2023 Women's World Cup, co-winners Football Australia criticised the Football Association (the FA; England). The UEFA Council members, including England, agreed to vote for Colombia together, so the FA had not voted for the Australia-New Zealand bid; Football Australia and media in Australia called England's vote \"disrespectful\" and \"a betrayal\". Due to colonial ties, the two nations traditionally have fierce sporting rivalries.\nTimezones and travel.\nA review of the development of women's football suggested that the location of the tournament so far from the main women's football markets in Europe and the Americas, meaning games will be played at unfavourable times for these audiences (typically overnight or in the early morning), \"does cause some problems\", but there are ways to still drive engagement through investment. It was noted that a major tournament being held in Australia for the first time meant that it was immensely popular in the host country. Brazil also recorded a different problem with the match schedule: anticipating that people would come to work late in order to watch the team play, the government moved the working hours for the civil service to later in the day for Brazil's group stage games. Morning mass in the hometown of one of the Ireland players was moved earlier so that people could watch their games, while several bars in Washington, D.C. operated 24-hour service during the World Cup after the city approved extended alcohol license hours.\nCanadian writer Cathal Kelly was scathing in an opinion piece on the game times, which typically fell in the early morning or late evening in Toronto; Kelly opined that \"North America is not the centre of the world, but it is the centre of the women's soccer world\", and so should have been prioritised when scheduling matches in Australia and New Zealand. He suggested that many fans would want to watch Spanish star Alexia Putellas play but would not be able to without staying up late on weeknights, though some of the Spain matches were at more reasonable times for viewing in Western Europe. He described the fact not all games were played at appropriate times for North Americans as diminishing the importance of the World Cup, saying it was instead \"a half-the-World Cup\".\nThe amount of travel required for teams between host cities was also criticised; due to the size of Australia and the distance between it and New Zealand, all teams playing the group stage in Australia, and all teams from the New Zealand groups that qualify for knock-out stage, will travel over a thousand miles.\nBroadcasting rights controversy.\nAfter FIFA president Gianni Infantino had said that comparatively low broadcasting rights bids for the tournament from the \"big five\" countries was an insult to \"all women worldwide\", and that FIFA had a \"moral and legal obligation\" to demand more money, he and FIFA were faced with criticism for causing the issue themselves and then lecturing on it. Former FIFA Council member Moya Dodd and sponsorship partner Ricardo Fort opined that FIFA should invest money from previous combined bids into the women's game (though past bids were for both Men's and Women's World Cups, FIFA attributed it all to the men's). Dave Roberts, who has worked with FIFA's in-house streaming broadcaster FIFA+, suggested that FIFA created the problem so that they could exclusively broadcast the tournament in the biggest markets themselves, while Glen Killane (executive director of Eurovision Sport) and former player Rebecca Sowden blamed FIFA for not discussing growth of women's football with broadcasters to assure them of financial viability.\nFIFA also expressed similar dissatisfaction from bids from Japanese broadcasters\n with FIFA reasoning the low bids are more unreasonable considering that Japan is in a more convenient timezone than in its European counterparts.\nFIFA had originally tendered for bids for broadcasting rights in June and July 2022, and had not expressed dissatisfaction with these bids until May 2023, almost a year later and shortly before the tournament was set to begin. Ofcom wrote that late rights acquisition was not the fault of broadcasters.\nIn a press conference the day before the tournament commenced, Infantino said that he would only talk about positive things until it was over, but still criticised broadcasters.\nSydney Football Stadium plaques.\nAs part of FIFA's \"clean stadium policy\", host venues are required to remove their own sponsorship and branding (e.g. taking a neutral name for the tournament duration) from ten days before the tournament begins until 24 hours after it ends, in order to protect the commercial interests of FIFA's sponsorship partners. Sydney Football Stadium, commercially known as Allianz Stadium, fulfilled this but was also told to cover the plaques adjacent to some statues of sports personalities surrounding the stadium. Some of the plaques featured logos, which FIFA may have considered to be a commercial interest. From the start, FIFA advisors had suggested not covering the plaques, but FIFA did it anyway. When the plaques were covered in July 2023, it drew outcry in Australia, with people angered that their sporting heroes were being hidden, especially during a related event; the daughter of Johnny Warren, one of the players whose plaque was covered, said that it was \"beyond stupid[,] but it is not the first thing that FIFA has done that is really dumb.\" FIFA immediately backtracked and said the plaques should be uncovered; however, this revealed that many had been damaged in the process, drawing further complaints.\nSponsorship deals.\nCriticism was levelled at FIFA for not giving the tournament \"an opportunity to sell itself\". FIFA only secured sponsorship deals late before the tournament began, not allowing time for adequate promotion of the tournament with commercial partners: major sponsors like McDonald's and Unilever signed up two months before the World Cup, and a TikTok collaboration was announced only a week before. The late threat of not selling broadcasting rights to major markets also stopped advertisers from partnering, at the risk of significantly fewer people tuning in. It was suggested that the late deals pointed to a lack of planning on FIFA's behalf, not considering that brands need time \"to invest and create brilliant campaigns\".\nWellington public transport.\nMetlink, which operates public transport in Wellington, provided free travel to World Cup ticket-holders. However, they underestimated the number of people who would be using this service; Metlink said that the poor weather in Wellington had caused more people to want to take public transport than typical, which was the reason they were not prepared for the number. Trains were overfilled and there were still fans unable to get on, missing the start of games. The public strongly criticised the planning operations, as well as the effect it had in preventing people accessing the World Cup. A separate bus company stepped in to provide replacement transportation, with Metlink saying that they were reviewing the service and would increase train carriages to the maximum possible from the third game onward, after the first two games demonstrated the demand. Metlink then said they would not run additional bus services if knockout games went to extra time; acknowledging that fans would have to leave the match early in order to travel home, Metlink said that adding buses would require reallocating drivers and the change in scheduling would have a knock-on effect to services the next day.\nLegacy plan.\nAustralia.\nThe legacy plan, set to capitalise on the presence of the tournament in its host nations and cities, was criticised by Australian sports personalities and particularly Indigenous Australians. During the tournament, critics said that the Legacy 23 plan did not have enough focus on Indigenous groups in sports. Some criticised Football Australia, while the Indigenous Football Australia group wrote to FIFA, Football Australia, and the government. Football Australia responded by saying that the plan did not have a lack of funding for Indigenous football. Critics still felt that there was not enough designated funding in Legacy 23, and that there was no enduring commitment to First Nations football in the plan. Football Australia responded that there were other projects with funding devoted to football programmes \"that had a specific First Nations element\".\nNew Zealand.\nAs part of the legacy plan, host cities were awarded funding to encourage women and girls into football. The New Zealand city of Hamilton spent $170,000 of their $500,000 grant to build a sculpture of a giant football in bright colours. Only $50,000 went to football programmes in the region. Critics alleged that the funding had been misused, and said the sculpture was unlikely to empower female football players. The sculpture was also unveiled at the same time as one of New Zealand's warm-up matches on 10 July, preventing fans from participating. The planners said that girls taking photos with the sculpture would inspire them.\nInfantino absences.\nWhile Infantino had spent nearly a year before the 2022 FIFA World Cup in its host country Qatar in order to \"fulfill his presidential duties\", he had rarely visited Women's World Cup co-host New Zealand in the run-up to the 2023 tournament, and did not visit Australia at all. During the tournament – despite having made a point of attending every match of the 2022 Men's World Cup, and encouraging fans to buy more tickets to Women's World Cup matches by saying \"do the right thing, come to watch the matches\" – Infantino only watched a few matches in New Zealand at the start of the tournament before leaving for Tahiti. While the distances involved made it impossible to attend every match as he had in Qatar, he was criticised for staying less than a week, avoiding one of the host nations completely, and for cynicism (having said others were disrespectful towards the event).\nPlayer payments rescinded.\nAfter several national associations had not paid their women's team players at previous tournaments, global player union FIFPRO had helped players from around the world organise an open letter requesting FIFA to provide equal pay; though FIFA did not oblige, it did promise ahead of the 2023 Women's World Cup to make sure that some of the prize money would be given to players. Initially stated to be paid separately to the association prize money, it was revealed that the FIFA player payments would instead go to the national associations and FIFA would make sure the associations paid the players. During the tournament, Infantino then further amended this to say that FIFA had \"issued recommendations\" to the associations and did not have the means to check how much money players received, while also suggesting that different tax situations in various countries could be a cause of some players receiving different amounts.\nQualification.\nRussian participation.\nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) initially handed Russia a four-year ban from all major sporting events, after the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) was found non-compliant for handing over manipulated laboratory data to investigators. However, the Russian national team could have still entered qualification, as the ban only applies to final tournaments to decide the world champions. The WADA ruling allowed athletes who were not involved in doping or the coverup to compete, but not a team representing Russia that uses the Russian flag and anthem. The decision was appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which upheld WADA's ban but reduced it to two years. The CAS ruling also allowed the name \"Russia\" to be displayed on uniforms as long as the words \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\" have equal prominence. Had Russia qualified for the tournament, its female players would have been able to use their country's name, flag and/or anthem at the Women's World Cup, unlike their male counterparts, as the reduced ban expired on 16 December 2022.\nHowever, following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, FIFA announced a number of sanctions impacting Russia's participation in international football on 27 February 2022. Russia was prohibited from hosting international competitions, and the national team had been ordered to play all home matches behind closed doors in neutral countries. Under these sanctions, Russia would not be allowed to compete under the country's name, flag, or national anthem; like the Russian athletes' participation in events such as the Olympics, the team would compete under the abbreviation of their national federation, the Russian Football Union (\"RFU\"), rather than \"Russia\". The women's team had remained largely unaffected with participation in qualifications, albeit suspended \"until further notice\". On 2 May, UEFA announced further sanctions regarding the ongoing suspension, ruling the women's team ineligible to compete further in the UEFA qualifiers. As a result, the Russian team were automatically unable to qualify, with Denmark automatically qualifying due to no further competition.\nQualification process.\nUEFA's qualification process for the Women's World Cup did not include preliminary rounds, and as such each group contained both top and low level teams. Due to goal difference being used as a tie breaker, nations would be encouraged to run up the score when facing a weaker opponent; in November 2021, Belgium defeated Armenia 19–0 and England defeated Latvia 20–0, the latter heavily criticised due to England's high global ranking. People from both the England and Latvia camps said that the qualification process was too uneven, not posing a challenge for stronger teams while serving to demotivate weaker ones. UEFA subsequently changed to the Women's Nations League format as qualifiers for future major tournaments, with nations to compete against others of a similar level and able to move up and down in grouping based on performance.\nAll other confederations used their continental tournament as the qualifiers for the Women's World Cup, which global player union FIFPRO criticised, saying that they should be held separately to improve participation. It particularly highlighted CONMEBOL for using the Copa América as qualification into three international tournaments.\nZambia players eligibility.\nAhead of the 2022 Women's Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON), which also served as the Confederation of African Football (CAF) Women's World Cup qualification competition, the CAF requested the participating member associations to perform sex verification (or \"gender eligibility\") tests on all their players, despite FIFA only requiring such testing if concerns are raised about individuals. Four players for Zambia were ruled out due to failing the test administered by the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ), with the most prominent of them being captain Barbra Banda. What test the FAZ used was unclear, but Banda's agent has suggested it was not suitable. The FAZ offered the players hormone medication, but they reportedly all refused due to hearing of side effects in the case of Caster Semenya; Banda already took testosterone suppressant medication. With supporters of Banda displeased that the fan favourite would not be able to compete, the FAZ and CAF both blamed the other: the CAF said that the FAZ had simply not named the four players to their squad, with the FAZ arguing that they did not do so as they expected the CAF to ban them. The FAZ lodged an appeal against the CAF for the tests; the CAF response was brusque and maintained their same argument. Though Banda and the other players were unable to be involved in WAFCON, they were able to participate in the Women's World Cup.\nQualification conditions.\nThe qualification series for the Women's World Cup was criticised by FIFPRO in a report published in June 2023 that assessed the different competitions. It said that players were put at risk through a variety of factors, describing many of the conditions as non-elite, and specifically highlighted that 70% of the players had not received an electrocardiogram – a type of heart health check considered routine in men's football – before continental competitions and 54% had not had any form of pre-tournament medical. Among the open responses, many players surveyed indicated that they were worried about mental load.\nTeams.\nSexual misconduct allegations.\nZambia – Bruce Mwape.\nIn September 2022, the FAZ announced that it had referred accusations of sexual misconduct made against Bruce Mwape, the head coach of its women's team, to the police and FIFA for investigation. In July 2023, several testimonies were published, and a source close to the players revealed that they were receiving threats saying they would be punished for speaking out; the source also said that FAZ continued to employ Mwape because Zambia was performing well. With FIFA's investigation process being opaque and not acknowledged by the organisation, Human Rights Watch (HRW) criticised FIFA for not having \"good governance measures to get sexual abuses out of sport\"; a spokesperson also commented on FIFA's hypocrisy of partnering with UN Women for the tournament in a campaign to end violence against women, while not appearing to follow this itself.\nWhen Zambia exited the tournament, players reported Mwape to FIFA with claims that he had groped a player during a training session before their final game; the players had waited until they were leaving to report for fears of repurcussions. FIFA confirmed they had received this complaint; the FAZ said they had not received a complaint or heard of any issue, and stated their surprise when media asked them to comment about it. The FAZ provided a statement saying that all their training sessions were filmed but they had no footage to share.\nHaiti – Yves Jean-Bart.\nThe president of the Haitian Football Federation (FHF), Yves Jean-Bart, had been banned from football in 2020 after a FIFA investigation determined he had abused his position to sexually harass and abuse \"various female players, including minors\". However, this ban was overturned in early 2023 by the CAS. In July 2023, FIFA appealed the decision but was rejected by CAS. The CAS was criticised by HRW, primarily for not offering identity protection for witnesses and so discouraging them from testifying. HRW also criticised FIFA \"for not ensuring that harm reduction practices were in place\". Haitian players did not want to talk about Jean-Bart when interviewed ahead of the tournament, saying they were united and focused on the present and future to perform well at the World Cup instead.\nSpain – Luis Rubiales.\nDuring the medal ceremony after Spain won the World Cup, Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) president Luis Rubiales kissed Jennifer Hermoso on the lips, despite her visible displeasure. The action drew criticism, particularly towards the continued sexism in the sport, and calls for Rubiales's resignation. In a separate incident at the end of the match, Rubiales was filmed pointing to the Spain players before grabbing his crotch, with the obscene gesture further criticised as he was standing next to the teenage Infanta Sofía.\nAfter Hermoso had said she did not expect or like the kiss, Rubiales entered the players' dressing room, reportedly throwing his arm around Hermoso and joking about marrying her in Ibiza. While on a layover returning from Australia, Rubiales published an apology video in which he said that he had no bad intentions and was sorry for distracting from the celebration, saying: \"I have to apologise, learn from this, and understand that when you are president you have to be more careful.\"\nRubiales faced heavy criticism for his actions, and calls for him to resign from various Spanish footballing bodies as well as the government. He and Vilda tried to make Hermoso support Rubiales, issuing a fake statement when she would not. Hermoso issued a statement through her union, Futpro, with the union saying the kiss was unacceptable and that they were working on seeing it punished.\nThe RFEF called an extraordinary general meeting for 25 August.\nPlayers' disputes with national associations.\nIn the run-up to the Women's World Cup there were multiple instances of disputes between collective players and their national football associations relating to matters of professionalism. \"The Athletic\" noted that these disputes, no matter their scope or resolution status, \"will all have caused disruption of some degree before the World Cup... It is, to say the least, not ideal.\"\nSpain.\nAhead of and during the 2022 Women's Euro, Spanish players attempted to express concerns about the quality of their national team training. Experiencing push-back from the RFEF, fifteen players withdrew from selection in September 2022. Spain manager Jorge Vilda recalled three of the fifteen players to the squad for the Women's World Cup, as well as two players, Alexia Putellas and Irene Paredes, who had supported them. When asked about the squad, Vilda did not talk about the extended absence or the missing players. Putellas and Paredes had both been captains of the squad before the dispute; despite their recall, the captaincy was not returned to them, though Vilda said he hoped they would help lead the team. Reportedly, Putellas' leadership was crucial to the players who returned doing so, and to bringing unity back to the Spanish squad.\nCanada.\nIn February 2023, the Canadian team announced they were planning to strike indefinitely due to unpaid salaries from the Canadian Soccer Association (Canada Soccer) as well as other issues with the association. After sitting out of training ahead of the 2023 SheBelieves Cup, the players returned to the team when Canada Soccer threatened to sue them; Canada Soccer then began mediation with the players to resolve many of the other issues, though pay was still a \"sticking point\" in June 2023.\nIn June 2023, the Canadian government ordered a financial audit of Canada Soccer, labelling this a requirement to receive future government funds due to concerns over Canada Soccer's financial transparency following the team's strike threat. In reference to the issues, captain Christine Sinclair said on 22 June 2023 that the players were \"not at a point where [they're] not getting on a plane, but time's coming where [they] want it done\".\nOn 1 July 2023, Canada Soccer announced that it may need to file bankruptcy, among a list of possible outcomes, as it did not have enough funds to resolve problems, maintain its squads, or develop football in Canada.\nFrance.\nIn March 2023, senior players in the French team said they would withdraw from the squad because of differences. The French Football Federation (FFF) held its own investigation and found that the issues between players and management had \"reached a point of no return\", and that the fracture would negatively impact the team's Women's World Cup campaign. As a result, the FFF fired coach Corinne Diacre later that month.\nJamaica.\nIn June 2023, Jamaican players shared an open letter on social media, criticising the Jamaica Football Federation (JFF) for lack of planning, resources and funding. Indicating that these were longstanding issues, the players highlighted that logistics of training camps should not be their own concern ahead of a World Cup. By the end of June, two online crowdfunding campaigns had been opened to raise a combined $175,000 to fund the training camp and travel expenses. ESPN criticised the attitude of the JFF, which it said gave the sense that the JFF thought the reaction from the players was \"out of the blue\" despite a similar issue occurring at the previous World Cup, and described the need for players' parents to individually crowd-fund as depressing.\nSouth Africa.\nOn 2 July 2023, South Africa were scheduled to play their final warm-up match before the Women's World Cup. Due to disputes with the South African Football Association (SAFA) over issues including pay, with SAFA refusing to include salary in contracts, preparation and training quality, and pitch quality, the entire squad withdrew from the match.\nWithout any World Cup players, the match still went ahead, though was delayed, with SAFA asking local teams to send players so they could field a team; one player was 13. The team lost 0–5 to Botswana, a nation ranked 96 places below South Africa. Coach Desiree Ellis did not comment on the issues in post-match interviews. One SAFA official described the players as unreasonable, saying SAFA did not need to pay them as FIFA was; another official leaked to local press that the organisation thought the players were \"mercenaries\" and \"traitors\".\nFormer captain Portia Modise spoke out against SAFA on 4 July, saying that the same issues had existed when she played and that SAFA always promised to work on them but never did. Modise also criticised Ellis not supporting the players. The next day, the Motsepe Foundation, which had been set up by Confederation of African Football (CAF) president Patrice Motsepe, stepped in to give money to the players. Captain Refiloe Jane later said that the dispute had been settled before the tournament, with the confirmation that the team would receive the standard pay from FIFA and money from the Motsepe Foundation donation.\nEngland.\nMedia publications on behalf of the England team also expressed frustration towards their association on 2 July 2023, following a breakdown in negotiations between player union the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), representing players, and the FA: the FA did not want to give bonuses to the players despite having done so at previous tournaments, feeling that they did not need to pay players now that FIFA was, as well as already funding the team's travel and accommodation. FIFA had said that its payments should be \"the base level and not a ceiling\" for player pay; the England team statement said they felt that the FA was acting like a federation aiming for the bare minimum and not a world leader, with players from other major teams (including the United States, Spain and Australia) at the Women's World Cup set to receive bonuses. The team said they hoped the issue would be resolved before the tournament began and that a collective agreement would be put in place for the future; in 2020, the FA had promised to pay the women's team the same fees and bonuses as the men's team going forward. England head coach Sarina Wiegman said that while she was not part of the payment dispute, and that the players were not letting it affect them during training, she hoped it would be resolved positively before the tournament began.\nThe dispute came as part of wider frustration regarding commercial opportunities for the team, with the FA having also restricted players from making appearances for sponsors ahead of the Women's World Cup, an important marketing period, further limiting their ability to make money. As part of the media announcement on 2 July, the team said they had been pressured \"not to rock the boat\" so close to the tournament. Lucy Bronze later explained that they found having to push \"frustrating\", but said it is the way improvements are achieved in women's sport. Some players had also previously been unhappy at being put in the middle of the release date conflicts between the FA and their clubs, with the commercial strategy said to further strain the relationship.\nOn 5 July, the FA announced that they would allow players to use social media at certain times during the tournament in order to fulfill sponsorship deals, having previously announced a complete social media blackout stated to be in order to prevent distractions. The relaxed terms were agreed to by the team, though with the understanding that there will be further discussions after the World Cup and before any future tournaments. The discussions around bonus pay resumed, with reports that the FA had made an offer for pay supplements from commercial partners. The team was reportedly considering forms of strike action short of affecting their participation, including potentially boycotting England media duties. The FA did not change their stance on paying players, but acknowledged the wider concern of the commercial strategy needed improvement. On 18 July, four days before their first match, the players themselves published an open letter which said they were pausing the discussions until after the World Cup, with the full intention to resume; it also noted that they had first gone to the FA with their commercial concerns in 2022. The PFA chief executive, Maheta Molango, criticised the FA for underestimating the players and for resisting progress. The FA was reportedly taken by surprise that the players would take the \"extraordinary action\" of issuing a statement themselves.\nNigeria.\nIn June 2023, there was controversy when Nigeria coach Randy Waldrum announced his team selection, with suggestion that the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) had pressured him into choices. The player list remained the same as previous selections, except for the omission of veteran player Ngozi Okobi in favour of teenager Deborah Abiodun; the latter had shortly before committed to join the University of Pittsburgh soccer team, which Waldrum also coaches, so he knew her current fitness. There was suggestion that Waldrum received pressure from the NFF to drop Okobi, but an official said that the squad list was all Waldrum's choices. Waldrum said that he was choosing blind due to lack of national training camps, caused by lack of NFF financial support; the Nigeria team was supposed to begin training for the Women's World Cup in June but were unable to, with Waldrum unable to assess the players before needing to announce a squad list and so going off the fitness of players at previous camps. The Nigeria team began training after arriving in Australia in July 2023. It was later revealed that the NFF had canceled the earlier training camp because they considered it a \"waste of resources\".\nOn 7 July, the Nigeria team announced that they were planning to boycott their opening game of the World Cup, set to be against Canada in Group B, due to the NFF informing them that they would not pay the players bonuses, either. The captain later denied rumours that the team had planned to boycott the whole World Cup. Nigeria players had staged a training strike, for the same reasons, in July 2022 ahead of the 2022 Women's Africa Cup of Nations. Upon the team's arrival in Australia, six members of the Nigeria team acted as representatives and held a meeting, during which agreed that they would be prepared to strike, especially as the squad morale \"plummeted\" when they were told they would not receive bonuses nor the 30% cut of FIFA grant money to the federation that was supposed to be earmarked for players.\nWaldrum separately continued speaking out against the NFF, including defending the players and publicly saying that the federation had cut players from the national team unilaterally when they gave feedback that the NFF had requested but did not want to be so negative. He said that his players do not have the same pride in being selected as players for the United States do, as the Nigerians are not treated with respect. The NFF first prevented Waldrum from bringing assistant coach Lauren Gregg to the World Cup, and then gave a statement calling him deficient. Waldrum accused them of stealing money intended for the team, and on 8 July the rumour emerged that the NFF were considering firing him.\nZambia.\nOn the first day of the World Cup, a media publication for the Zambia team reported that the players had not been paid since the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. The players boycotted training for two days ahead of their World Cup warm-up match against Germany, in which Zambia recorded a surprise victory, and mounted silent protests while at training camp in New Zealand. One expression of this was not singing in usual tradition during travel. On 17 July, the president of Zambia, Hakainde Hichilema, held a video meeting with the team and suggested that the payment issue would be resolved, telling them \"Do your part and your government will do its part\".\nThe players were also reportedly made to sign a code of conduct for training camp, imposing restrictions on them.\nPlayers' disputes with coaching staff.\nNorway.\nIn the press room after Norway lost the opening match to New Zealand in a surprise defeat, Norwegian players Caroline Graham Hansen and Ingrid Syrstad Engen spoke about where they felt the approach had been lacking. Ahead of Norway's second match, Graham Hansen missed a training day and a media appearance due to a reported sore throat, though manager Hege Riise said she was fully fit. Reported in the days before, both the players were then removed from the starting lineup for the second match, against Switzerland; there was particular focus on the benching of Graham Hansen, considered one of the best players. News media reported that there were growing tensions between Norway players and coaching staff. Riise received criticism, before and after the match, for benching an important player; she defended it as a tactical decision. Graham Hansen and Syrstad Engen were used as substitutes in the match, but the team still recorded a draw.\nAfter the second game, Graham Hansen answered media questions about how she was frustrated at the benching; that she had felt \"stepped on\" in the national team for a year; that Law of Jante ideals are strong in the team; and that she was shown no respect, in a series of responses that drew significant attention. Though speaking about her experience, she did not answer questions that would implicate anyone in particular. In response to hearing Graham Hansen's comments, Riise told the media \"bluntly\" that she was not stepped on.\nThe next day, Graham Hansen made a surprise appearance in Riise's press conference, reading a statement from a mobile phone to say that she had been too emotional and while she still meant her statements, she was sorry for voicing them and distracting attention from the football. She also gave an explanation for her comment about being \"stepped on\", saying that one of the first things Riise had done when she took over a year earlier was to remove Graham Hansen from the team's leadership group; Graham Hansen said that she still disagreed with this, but should not have mentioned it, either. Graham Hansen had withdrawn from the team with a heart condition shortly after Riise's appointment, returning months later. Riise said that she forgave her, with Guro Reiten adding that Graham Hansen had sent a message to the team asking for forgiveness. Syrstad Engen then told Norwegian media that she agreed with Graham Hansen and was in the same situation, understanding why her teammate had made the statements. Julie Blakstad said that she and the team were not impressed that Graham Hansen had made the statements; Reuters reported that many of the Norway players sympathise with Graham Hansen, even if they did not want her to talk about it. Before Norway's third match, Norwegian media published \"a detailed report\" of issues the players have with Riise's management.\nAda Hegerberg also did not play in Norway's second match after being named to the starting lineup, pulling out with a groin injury after the anthems; her absence was considered suspicious by some, though, which noted Hegerberg had previously spent six years away from the team while vocally criticising them. After the match, Riise said she did not know about Hegerberg's injury and had not spoken to either Hegerberg or medical staff about an injury.\nRepublic of Ireland.\nShortly before the tournament, allegations of the Republic of Ireland's head coach Vera Pauw being abusive while in a former coaching position resurfaced. Whenever this was brought up with Ireland players, they did not give Pauw full support, with their silence reportedly being loud. In July 2023, Ireland captain Katie McCabe admitted that she and Pauw had clashed but kept professional. After Ireland's final game, Pauw admitted that McCabe had asked for changes in the match that Pauw did not allow; McCabe then posted on social media with a zipped face emoji (🤐), with the BBC saying \"You can read into that whatever you want\", but suggesting that it showed the feud between players and Pauw had been made public. Pauw was also, with Ireland being knocked out after two matches, feuding with the FAI Women over her potential renewal. In her last pre-match press conference of the tournament she criticised the FAI Women for being \"unfair\", saying she deserved to know her employment future and suggesting that the FAI Women were also harming the players by leaving them uncertain as to their coach and in the position of being asked about the issue.\nRepublic of Ireland chant video.\nUpon winning a match against Scotland that saw the Republic of Ireland qualify for the World Cup, many Irish players performed \"Ooh, ahh, up the Ra\", a chant that originates from a Scottish football song and which glorifies the guerrilla Irish Republican Army. A video of this was uploaded to social media by one of the players and met with criticism. There was particular criticism from the people of Birmingham; several of the Ireland team play for Birmingham City, and it was the site of the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings. Police Scotland investigated the incident and the Football Association of Ireland, Women's (FAI Women) was fined €20,000 by UEFA for violating rules of decency; the team offered an apology and said they had spoken to the players, with Birmingham City also disciplining players.\nKheira Hamraoui exclusion.\nWhen France's team selection was announced, midfielder Kheira Hamraoui was not included. Manager Hervé Renard said that this was purely a sporting decision, but Hamraoui rejected this, calling her exclusion an injustice; the pair had reportedly had long discussions about the possible selection. In 2021, Hamraoui had been the victim of an attack, with reports the police suspected jealousy from other French players was the motive. The attack and the fallout caused deep fractures between Hamraoui and other players, though former France manager Diacre had included her in the squad in February 2023. Hamraoui and her agent had felt the communication with the team was positive, with the agent giving the example of the United States as a successful team even though \"all the players don't like each other.\"\nColombia flight.\nThe Colombian Football Federation (FCF) had booked the Colombia staff and players on two flights: the staff and some players to depart Colombia on 8 July, with most of the players following the next day. The players were booked into first or business class (a requirement per FIFA's updated rules on player accommodation) but airline LATAM had overbooked the section and moved the team to a later flight, which would interfere with their camp schedule. The FCF managed to move eleven players to an Avianca flight for the original departure time, but was still criticised for their logistics not being able to include everyone on the same flight.\nHaka imitations.\nThe official social media accounts of two football associations, the RFEF (Spain) and the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB; Netherlands), uploaded videos of their training camps in New Zealand that each featured clips of players appearing to imitate haka, specifically the Ka Mate often performed by the New Zealand men's rugby union team (All Blacks). Haka are Māori ritual dances and, while having associations with sports in New Zealand, it is controversial for non-Māori people to perform haka, even when doing so correctly, if they do not have permission. The videos of the Spanish and Dutch players showed them \"attempting\" the haka and then laughing; the RFEF quickly took down their video, but was still heavily criticised in comments. They did not respond to questions about the video, but the Spanish captain apologised to tribal elders ahead of the tournament on behalf of the players. The KNVB also later took down their video, saying that there was no reference to the haka at all and that the video had shown players doing \"an exercise that was focused on channeling your inner strength\". Days later, one of the Dutch players made an apology post for her part in the video, while saying she had meant no disrespect. FIFA responded to questions about the videos by saying they would not comment; they had previously sent communications to teams about cultural respect while in Australia and New Zealand.\nAustralia video.\nOn 17 July, the players of co-hosts Australia, supported by Football Australia, published a video criticising FIFA for the tournament prize money continuing to be several times less than that of the men's competition. They also noted the positive developments in their own pay since establishing a collective bargaining agreement in 2019, criticising other national associations for not negotiating with players over payment. When Infantino was asked about the video and the wider issue of pay disparity on the day before the tournament, he declined to comment, saying \"to focus on the positives\" and that \"if somebody is still not happy about something then I am so sorry.\"\nZambia kit.\nZambia arrived in New Zealand without any football boots or shinpads, as the team does not provide custom kit. They expected to be able to purchase these items while in Hamilton, the city they were based in; football is less popular than rugby union in New Zealand, limiting their options and forcing them to go to other cities to find what they needed.\nReplica goalkeeper shirts.\nOn the first day of the World Cup, it was revealed that Nike does not produce replica women's goalkeeper shirts for commercial sale when an interview with Mary Earps, England goalkeeper and The Best FIFA Women's Goalkeeper, was published. In it, Earps said that she had been trying to find a way for the shirts to be produced, including discussing with both the FA and Nike and offering to front production costs herself, for some time. Acknowledging that it sounded frivolous compared to other issues, Earps said she was quite hurt by the fact that fans cannot buy women's goalkeeper shirts and that it sends the wrong message to young players that goalkeeping is not an aspirational position to play. Nike produce replica men's goalkeeper shirts in limited numbers, with Earps saying that a smaller run is very different to not being available at all. In early matches of the tournament, the starring performance of goalkeepers was a particular trend, and cartoonist David Squires illustrated a comic mocking the irony of this in light of Nike's decision.\nUnited States national anthem.\nMost of the players of the United States team refused to sing their national anthem before matches, part of wider political U.S. national anthem protests that had been ongoing since 2016. The action, like other anthem protests, was widely criticised by different groups in the United States. American journalist Megyn Kelly said that player Megan Rapinoe had driven the protest, saying Rapinoe had \"poisoned\" the rest of the team to hate the United States. In 2019, Rapinoe had said she would never sing the anthem again as a protest against injustice in the United States and the response of sports to punish other players protesting the anthem. Kelly called the team \"morons\" and \"shameful\", while some American fans called them disrespectful on social media; the squad's two captains and Julie Ertz did sing the anthem.\nPlayer welfare.\n\"ACL club\".\nAhead of the Women's World Cup, concerns of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in women's sports grew, with a number of high-profile injuries and noted lack of women-focused research despite the greater likelihood of women suffering the injury. In June 2023 it was reported that there would be at least 36 players likely to have participated in the tournament either missing it with or having just returned from ACL injury, dubbed the \"ACL club\", including England captain Leah Williamson and striker Beth Mead, Catarina Macario of the United States, and France's Delphine Cascarino. The injury being the cause of so many significant players being unavailable for the World Cup was a cause of controversy over the lack of measures taken around the injury, as well as reportedly creating tensions between national teams and the players' clubs.\nWith several injuries affecting the England team ahead of the World Cup, Caroline Nokes, a British MP and chair of the Women and Equalities Committee, petitioned major football boot brands and manufacturers to provide information on their approach to design and any women-specific designs they produce. The poor fit of football boots designed for typical male feet has been suggested as one factor increasing the risk of injury to women's players.\nSwedish coach and pundit Jonas Eidevall criticised the pitch quality of the Allianz Stadium, suggesting the turf was too dry and so studs getting caught in the ground (which can cause injury) was more likely, during the group stage match between England and Denmark. In the first half, Lauren James had attempted a knee slide after scoring but fell over, and Keira Walsh had caught her boot and had to be taken off with a knee, though not ACL, injury. England players who were asked did not think there was an issue with the pitch.\nSquad size.\nDue to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, squads were expanded in 2021 from 23 to 26players, with the new limit applying to various international tournaments, including the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Despite this, FIFA set the squad size limit for the 2023 Women's World Cup at 23players again. It did not give a reason for the decision, but sport media said that FIFA preferred fewer players and suggested that it did not see the same fitness concerns at the 2023 World Cup as at the 2022 World Cup, due to the latter taking place in the middle of many domestic football seasons (in Northern Hemisphere winter), while the former will take place during a typical break in the summer. Several top women's team coaches, including 2022 Euro finalists Wiegman and Martina Voss-Tecklenburg, asked FIFA to allow 26-person squads at the 2023 World Cup, with England manager Wiegman saying in November 2022 that larger squad sizes would be \"a necessity to safeguard players' welfare\". Wiegman reiterated the message when she named her squad in May 2023, saying that a larger squad does not prevent injury, but gives the option to use other players if someone needs rest or has a minor injury. She added that the congested international schedule for women exacerbated the fitness concern, also asking for better scheduling.\nEuropean mandatory release date conflicts.\nWiegman also expressed frustration over the European mandatory release date – when clubs must allow players called up to the World Cup to join their national team – proposed by FIFA, considering it too late to adequately prepare for a major tournament, especially one on the opposite side of the world. The mandatory release date is 10 July 2023; there were initial widespread criticisms from various national teams. These national associations, in particular the FA, objected to the late release date for the reason it may have a negative impact on player welfare if they have inadequate training. European clubs were reluctant to release players earlier, as FIFA's protection programme (which compensates clubs if their players are injured on international duty) would only cover from the release date. Due to the criticism, FIFA announced in May 2023 that the protection would be extended to cover \"from the moment that players leave their club for their duties with their national team until their return\". The European Club Association (ECA), which represents domestic clubs in European leagues, criticised the national associations for ignoring the date and announcing earlier training camps, but acknowledged 10 July was too late. After these criticisms and discussion with the ECA, FIFA announced an extended release window, starting on 23 June 2023. The ECA felt that any earlier and the national teams (several of which did start earlier) could be causing their players mental fatigue.\nThe release date caused even further conflict and debate in England, with their training camp starting on 19 June. The FA and Wiegman had given extensive criticisms of the late release date, saying that their plans for England's preparation had been made by experts months in advance to benefit player welfare and were at risk of being disrupted, adding that the plans would be hard to change due to FIFA announcing the release date so late. England players were drawn into the conflict by being asked outside of their clubs if they would show up for the planned training camp, and told they would not play a preparation match if they did not; Beth Mead, who was not part of the squad due to injury, said that players \"don't want to be the middleman\" in club and country disputes, as it causes them unnecessary stress. While Wiegman was said to be reasonable, FA leaders reportedly \"burned bridges\" with its players' clubs, especially those in the Women's Super League (WSL), by insisting on the earlier release and by involving players; in the hours before the 2023 UEFA Women's Champions League final, the FA held an emergency meeting in Eindhoven (the location of the final) involving representatives from most of the clubs and lead figures in the FA. The clubs were primarily unhappy that they had not been consulted and that the FA was unwilling to compromise, but all WSL clubs as well as Barcelona allowed their players to be released early. Though \"The Guardian\" opined that the FA put its World Cup ambition ahead of good club relations, it pointed out that FIFA was ultimately to blame, as it had created \"a mess of a calendar\" in women's football that was overloaded with tournaments.\nNetherlands training ground.\nThe training ground for the Netherlands team in New Zealand (ahead of travelling to their base camp when the tournament began) was the Bay Oval, a cricket ground. The team had been promised ahead of the tournament that the ground would be made suitable – including removal of the cricket pitch, a hard surface, from the middle of the ground – but this did not happen. Manager Andries Jonker expressed concern for the welfare of his players; highlighting the biomechanical dangers of running from grass onto the hard surface, as well as potential harm if falling onto it, Jonker said the team were unable to do any full pitch practice or play practice games in their training as the pitch would be unavoidable. Other exercises, which could be spaced around the pitch, went ahead. He said the alternative solutions presented to them were to fly to their base camp earlier, which would disrupt the training schedule, or to use a training ground in a city an hour and a half away, which they considered excessive travel.\nIreland–Colombia warm-up match.\nSeveral warm-up matches were played on 14 July 2023 after teams arrived in the host nations. One of these, between the Republic of Ireland and Colombia, was abandoned after 23 minutes of game time due to what the FAI Women called \"overly physical\" play on behalf of the Colombian team; the FCF responded that their players were trained in the spirit of \"healthy competition\" but they respected Ireland \"preferr[ing] not to continue\". The Irish team staff had spoken to match officials about the game being played too physically for a warm-up friendly after several rough challenges and a particularly hard tackle from an unnamed Colombian player that saw Denise O'Sullivan taken to hospital during the early stages of the match. The officials agreed to end the match. Ireland coach Vera Pauw had already asked Colombia coach Nelson Abadía to calm his players after an earlier tackle on Ruesha Littlejohn. After Colombian player Daniela Caracas said that the Ireland players were \"just girls\" who should \"eat shit\" for worrying about the rough play, Pauw noted that her team were known for their physical play themselves, but the level of Colombia's physicality had been \"outside the rules of the game\". Pauw also confirmed that O'Sullivan had not suffered serious injury, but she was still unable to train.\nLinda Caicedo.\nThe Colombia team was criticised first for playing Linda Caicedo in their group stage match against Germany, and then for not taking her off. In training a few days before the match, Caicedo collapsed seemingly unconscious and had to be taken to hospital by ambulance, with the team releasing a statement saying she had only been tired, but had recovered. During the match, in which she scored, Caicedo appeared to collapse again and was attended by medical staff but not substituted until the sixth minute of injury time (90+6').\nHuman rights.\nSaudi Arabia and Qatar sponsorships.\nOn 1 February 2023, it was reported that Visit Saudi, the tourism board of Saudi Arabia, was going to be one of the main sponsors of the tournament. FIFA had pursued the sponsorship without consulting either of Football Australia or New Zealand Football, the host football associations. Shortly after the announcement, the World Cup Organising Committee asked FIFA for clarification on the sponsorship and how the partnership would work. HRW said the decision showed disregard for how Saudi Arabia treats women, with the decision called sportswashing by human rights campaigns. Another major concern was the mixed message of the partnership as many players at the World Cup, as members of the LGBT+ community, would not be able to visit Saudi Arabia without fear of prosecution. Players and coaches including Alex Morgan, Emma Hayes, Becky Sauerbrunn and Megan Rapinoe publicly denounced the deal and urged FIFA not to partner with Visit Saudi. In March 2023, Football Australia and New Zealand Football publicly opposed the potential sponsorship; later in the month, FIFA announced they would drop the sponsorship deal, though this reportedly angered Saudi officials.\nInfantino described the reaction from players and associations as a \"storm in a teacup\", also calling Football Australia hypocrites due to Australia having diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia.\nSome people in Australia criticised the fact that little attention was given to Qatar Airways' late sponsorship of the tournament, especially compared to the backlash for the 2022 men's tournament; Qatar has similar human rights issues to Saudi Arabia and, in 2020, several Australian women were forced at gunpoint to do an invasive gynaecological strip search by the local authorities while on a layover in Doha after an abandoned baby was found in the airport.\nOneLove armband.\nFollowing condemnation of FIFA in the Western world for banning the OneLove rainbow armband at the Men's World Cup in 2022, FIFA agreed to pursue discussion of captains wearing the armband in advance of the Women's World Cup to \"have a solution in place\" before the start of the tournament. In May 2023, two top-level female executives at FIFA, Fatma Samoura and Sarai Bareman, announced to the media that discussions had begun, including consulting with national teams and their captains. On 30 June 2023, FIFA announced that both OneLove and Stonewall rainbow armbands would be banned at the tournament, with the same regulations as the Men's World Cup. They instead provided eight options of armbands: seven resembled the inclusivity armbands of the Men's World Cup, with the other armband, which bears the slogan \"Unite for Inclusion\", featuring a heart logo of the same colours and meaning of the OneLove armband. FIFA said that after \"open talks with stakeholders\" they decided to use the alternative armbands, with the slogans a product of consultation with participating teams and the United Nations. Like the OneLove armband, the Unite for Inclusion armband intentionally does not use the colours of the rainbow pride flag. \"The Telegraph\" debated whether to consider the look-a-like armband a \"significant compromise\" or not, as FIFA's armband regulations were just as restrictive anyway and players would still be sanctioned for wearing the OneLove armband.\nIn the May 2023 announcement, Samoura and Bareman had conceded that football was an appropriate platform for players to advocate for human rights, with Bareman saying that FIFA wants players to \"feel [like] they were able to use their voice\" at the tournament and that they \"understand, very well, that our female footballers like to use the sport as a platform to speak about issues that they're passionate about and one of those is the rainbow\". About 1 in 8 of all players at the tournament were openly LGBTQ+, including a quarter of captains. The host nations also have LGBT rights, with many competing teams having regularly worn rainbow armbands for years.\nSamoura opined that there would be less tension around the armband than at the Men's World Cup due to discussions having taken place beforehand. Despite this, \"The New York Times\" reported that the discussions between FIFA and the women's teams had not run smoothly, with teams frustrated at times after FIFA indicated as early as March 2023 that OneLove armbands would not be allowed. Days after the May announcement, Football Australia CEO James Johnson said that the talks with FIFA were positive and that he expected there would be players wearing rainbow armbands at the World Cup, but did not comment on if OneLove armbands would be permitted. Australian sport network Optus Sport noted that the cultural differences that were part of the controversy for the Men's World Cup in Qatar, where homosexuality is illegal, should not be a factor in a decision for the Women's World Cup. Still, the spokespersons did not indicate that FIFA would permit the OneLove armband, instead saying they were seeking a solution with \"balance\". Samoura told Optus in May 2023: \"if there is a way for us to promote human rights and the One Love band is a way to do it, we should find common ground with whoever would like to flag issues we don't discuss enough.\"\nAhead of the announcement of the permitted armbands on 30 June 2023, FIFA sent a letter to all participating nations with the armband rules, intending to prevent the breakdown in relations that occurred at the Men's World Cup when FIFA had declined to communicate and banned the OneLove armband only hours before matches were played. Johnson, who had been part of the discussions, acknowledged that FIFA had made progress since Qatar 2022 but said that FIFA's armband options \"didn't go as far\" as the representatives wanted or expected.\n\"Outsports\" was pleased that FIFA had not upheld the complete ban of rainbow symbols as in Qatar, but was still disappointed, while the \"i\" opined that FIFA had turned the intended activism into \"meaningless 'live laugh love' symbols\", saying the armbands matter as a point of symbolism, allyship and visibility. It criticised FIFA on several fronts: for not including any meaningful messaging and instead using buzzword slogans on their approved armbands; for restricting armbands in the first place, saying that minorities cannot use their voice or express choices when they only have pre-selected options; and for not explicitly including an armband that mentions sexuality. \"The Athletic\" levelled the same criticisms, and Johnson said he was disappointed in FIFA for banning rainbow armbands and not offering one supportive of LGBTQI. Sam Kerr, the openly lesbian captain of co-host Australia, said ahead of the tournament in July 2023 that every team had wanted to wear the OneLove armband but would not due to FIFA threatening sporting sanctions; Kerr said that they will use their voices in multiple other ways instead.\nActions during the tournament considered to be promoting LGBTQ+ visibility in ways other than an armband, also generally considered criticisms of FIFA's ban, include New Zealand's Ali Riley painting her fingernails in the colours of the transgender flag on one hand and rainbow pride flag on the other; venue Lang Park lighting up in a rainbow at halftime during the England–Haiti match; and South Africa's Thembi Kgatlana dyeing part of her hair in rainbow colours.\nTransgender inclusion debate.\nWhile doing publicity for the tournament and in light of FIFA beginning a review into its transgender policy following a 2022 announcement, American player and LGBTQ+ rights advocate Megan Rapinoe said that she would support the inclusion of transgender players in her squad. As well as advocating for the human rights of transgender athletes, Rapinoe also expressed her anger that women's sports, historically inclusive, were being weaponised to discriminate; that people who do not care for women's sports claim they do when they want to remove transgender athletes; and that these people did not try to achieve equity or fairness in other elements of women's sports, but used the concept of fairness as an excuse.\nRapinoe's comments were unpopular among American conservatives, many of whom responded with insults, comments about Rapinoe's impending retirement, and criticisms of the Nike advert describing her as an \"All-American hero\".\nThe tournament features Canada's Quinn, the first transgender player at a World Cup; Quinn was assigned female at birth. Broadcaster Piers Morgan, a vocal critic of transgender athletes in women's sport, launched a tirade directed at Quinn after Canada's first match. Occasionally misgendering Quinn, Morgan said that he did not believe someone could be non-binary and transgender, and that people who do not identify as women should not play in the Women's World Cup. Canada Soccer said that there will always be people with closed minds.\nIranian protests solidarity.\nThe Brazil team travelled to Australia on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner featuring images of Mahsa Amini, who died in custody of the Iranian Morality Police in 2022, and Amir Reza Nasr Azadani, an Iranian men's footballer serving a 26-year prison sentence for protesting Amini's death, on the tail wing. The plane also included decals along the fuselage with messages saying that nobody should be forced to wear a headdress, and nobody should be killed for speaking out against it. After the action drew attention to the team, \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" reported that the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) had chartered the plane and was not responsible for the decals; the plane reportedly belongs to Argentine aviator and filmmaker Enrique Piñeyro.\nMedia incidents.\nPundits and commentators.\nAhead of Australia's opening match, pundits for free-to-air network Channel 7 in Australia talked over the Welcome to Country speech, an Aboriginal ritual that was performed before the matches held in this nation. A dance from an Aboriginal dance clan accompanying the ritual was not broadcast, with pre-match punditry shown instead. With the World Cup having heavily promoted the inclusion of the native peoples of its hosts, and the hope from the people involved in the performance that it would get more visibility, the network's choice was controversial. Aunty Julie, the speaker for the Welcome to Country, described people speaking over her words as \"culturally devastating\" and a manner of silencing her culture. Australian viewers on social media said that the move, which was generally found disrespectful, was something they expected of Channel 7.\nDuring this match, viewers in Australia noted that the pundits for Channel 7 were constantly discussing how many mothers were playing, with a journalist noting that how many fathers are on the pitch is not mentioned in men's games. There was particular criticism for Channel 7 commentator David Basheer, who said that \"motherhood hasn't blunted [Katrina Gorry's] competitive instincts\". Some viewers considered this to have sexist overtones, including other journalists taking to social media to remark that it is insulting to think a woman's skills would be compromised by giving birth. Others responded to criticism of Basheer by saying that his comments were just clunky and he had supported women's football for a long time. When Gorry was asked about it, she said that she does not let that kind of comment get to her personally.\nOptus Sport, the main Australian broadcaster and a partner of the Women's World Cup, was criticised for using two male pundits to deliver pitchside commentary, with no women. Optus then made a \"fiery\" social media post defending the choice, with the male pundits in question also responding negatively to individual social media users who criticised the lack of female pundits.\nThe New Zealand network Sky Sport received complaints for its lack of New Zealander commentators during matches, especially those contested by the home team, for the opening matches; the broadcaster had not hired any of its own commentators and instead used FIFA's global feed. There was particular criticism that New Zealand viewers could not hear a reaction to the nation's landmark first goal and win from a local. Sky Sport hired Rosie White and Jason Pine as commentators for the remainder of New Zealand's games in response.\nMorocco press conference.\nAt a press conference before Morocco's opening match, a reporter from the BBC World Service asked captain Ghizlane Chebbak if any of her team's players were gay and how they were treated in Morocco, where all same-sex activity is illegal. Chebbak had already refused to answer a different journalist's question about player Nouhaila Benzina wearing a hijab. The moderator encouraged the World Service reporter to retract the question, but he responded that LGBTQ matters are not political and that his question was about players, pushing to ask it again; Chebbak did not answer and the conference was ended after the next question. Other journalists in the room criticised the reporter for, variously, asking something irrelevant and unnecessary; trying to out players; and asking Chebbak to make political comments that could put her at risk. One journalist explained that while it was natural to talk about \"the intersection of politics and sports\", it was important to do so without causing more harm to people affected by the politics. The BBC apologised and said that the reporter was inappropriate, with \"The Guardian\" reporting that \"the matter was addressed by Fifa after the conclusion of the press conference.\"\nWhen footage of the question, and Chebbak's uncomfortable reaction, was shared on social media, it provoked criticism for how journalists report on women's football; a popular channel for women's football content that shared the video added commentary saying that the question was based on the homophobic stereotype that female footballers are all lesbians, as no journalists asked similar questions of men's teams from homophobic nations during the 2022 Men's World Cup.\nIn various African countries, footballers accused of being lesbians have lost their jobs and homes. Anima Adjepong, a scholar in Queer African Studies, said that the question reflected a culture of focusing on female footballers' sexualities that, in Africa, was often used to cover up \"everyday forms of workplace sexual harassment\". Based on her cultural research and interviews with Ghanaian national team footballers, players who did not \"give in\" to sexual demands from coaches were accused of being lesbians; if players complained of harassment, they were accused of being lesbians and the complaints were not taken seriously, leading to fewer complaints. The coaches may also have sought to harm players who reported them by removing them from teams and spreading rumours of their sexuality in homophobic societies. Adjepong did call on the African football associations with a platform at the World Cup to \"[champion] the rights of LGBTQ+ citizens\" with an aim to create positive change in their countries.\nYamila Rodriguez tattoo.\nArgentina player Yamila Rodríguez has a leg tattoo of Portuguese men's player Cristiano Ronaldo, with images of it circulating on social media after she appeared in Argentina's opening match at the World Cup. Ronaldo had a long rivalry with Argentine legend Lionel Messi, with some Argentina fans thinking Rodríguez' tattoo was offensive and insulting to Messi, as well as disloyal, sentiments they posted widely on social media, drawing further attention. Rodríguez then posted to share that the \"awful things\" her nation's fans were saying about her were troubling her while she was trying to represent them, also noting that she has a tattoo of an Argentine player, Diego Maradona, as well.\nZambia press conference.\nAhead of Zambia's second match, the press conference was cut short when the gathered media would not stop asking about the allegations of sexual misconduct against Zambia coach Bruce Mwape. The conference began with football questions until a Spanish journalist breached the subject, asking what image Zambia was giving to the world that they would keep someone accused of serious misconduct in such a visible role. The moderator requested the next question; the journalists in the room were displeased that it had been completely brushed aside and began to all ask variations on the same question, refactored to relate to football.\nAustralia press conferences.\nIn the conference before Australia's second match, coach Tony Gustavsson faced questions about his training methods after two players sustained concussions during training in separate incidents; Gustavsson defended that \"it was completely normal training\". He had also selected a player still recovering from injury for the tournament, and was asked to defend this choice in light of the squad facing more injuries.\nGustavsson then faced criticism for his response to questions about Sam Kerr in the press conference before Australia's last group match. Kerr had been absent in earlier matches with a calf injury, with Gustavsson having said she would be assessed before the last group match. In the press conference, Mark Schwarzer asked if Kerr was fit and had been training, with Gustavsson first responding as if confused and then giving increasingly bizarre answers and laughing when Schwarzer continued to ask. Kerr had previously confirmed she had been training and would be available for the match, but would not give further details that their opposition, Canada, may be able to use to plan.\nSpain press conference.\nAfter Spain's surprise loss to Japan, Spanish media suggested that besieged coach Vilda had lost any remaining supporters except for the RFEF. When Vilda spoke to the press after this match and in advance of their round of 16 tie, he was asked where the team needs to improve and any tactical reflections. Instead of answering, he put on a team scarf and said his team would play for love of Spain and football; noticing \"negativity\" among the journalists he then led a \"let's go\" chant. Vilda was twice asked about how the players felt going into the match and refused to answer; instead, player Olga Carmona, who was also in the conference, spoke about how the players would make positional improvements. Vilda was further criticised in the media for lack of tactical nous exhibited in front of the press.\nAttacks on the United States team.\nCarli Lloyd.\nFollowing the United States tie with Portugal, former U.S. player and commentator Carli Lloyd criticised the behavior of the team, stating that they were celebrating and partying with fans instead of showing a willingness to improve after their poor group stage performance and near elimination from the tournament. She stated that the goalpost was the player of the match since Ana Capeta's shot had missed and bounced off and then said that she wouldn't have put the United States in the top ten. However, she received backlash from fans, the media, former teammate Ali Krieger and coach Vlatko Andonovski, with some stating that her criticisms were self centered and that the team still had the desire to win. However, some fans and other individuals like fellow former player and commentator Alexi Lalas agreed with her criticisms and stated that he shared her sentiments.\nJason Whitlock.\nDuring the tournament, conservative pundit and former American football player Jason Whitlock went on a lengthy rant on his podcast about Rapinoe specifically, and the United States team generally. Whitlock has disdained feminism and LGBTQ+ rights. He said that Rapinoe \"hates America because she hates herself\", among other insults, and that the team as a whole have no interest in sports or representing their nation, accusing them of treating the World Cup as a platform \"to demonize their investors\" and \"to go viral and cash in on the feminism pimp game\". He blamed this attitude on Rapinoe as a veteran of the squad and supposed toxic influence. He also criticised the team for being ungrateful to the United States and male sportspeople who had \"diminished opportunities for boys and men\" in order to help the women's team be successful.\nDonald Trump.\nFollowing the U.S. team loss on penalties during the knockout stage against Sweden, former U.S. President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that \"many of our players were openly hostile to America - No other country behaved in such a manner, or even close. WOKE EQUALS FAILURE. Nice shot Megan, the USA is going to Hell!!! MAGA\"\nOthers.\nSeveral conservative commentators applauded the fact that the U.S. team lost on penalties during the knockout stage against Sweden. Former Fox News personality Megyn Kelly said she was \"thrilled they lost\" and that \"You don’t support America, I don’t support you.\" Anti-Islam activist Brigitte Gabriel had written before the tournament that \"I love America and that’s why I am rooting against the woke U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team this year.\" The conservative \"Washington Examiner\" accused the team of being \"far more concerned pushing a woke agenda regarding equal pay for female athletes and the rights of LGBT citizens than they have been with winning games.\"\nAdam Boulton comments.\nBritish broadcaster Adam Boulton was discussing the World Cup on his podcast when he was told which teams had been knocked out and asked if the tournament was \"serious\" or \"just a kind of random kick around\", also belittling the players. A female presenter told him the players were professional athletes. The comments came to light when radio host Scott Bryan shared it, criticising Boulton's comments. Accusing Boulton of sexism, Bryan's listeners then shared the clip with their criticisms of Boulton on social media."

The season began in May in Dublin, Ireland, and ended in October in Staten Island, United States.\nSeason summary.\nPrior to the creation of the International Lawn Tennis Federation and the establishment of its world championship events in 1913 the Wimbledon Championships, the U.S. National Championships, the Irish Lawn Tennis Championships and the Northern Championships were considered by players and historians as the four most important tennis tournaments to win.\n1883 sees a decrease in the number women's singles events being held as the tennis circuit continues to form. In May 1883 at the first major event of the year the Irish Championships in Dublin, Ireland. In the women's Ireland's May Langrishe wins the singles title defeating her sister Beatrice Langrishe, she also picks up the mixed doubles title with Ernest Browne. In terms of draw size the West of England Championships was the largest tournament of the year with a draw of 46 across three events.\nIn June 1883 at the second major tournament of the year the Northern Championships in Manchester featured a full schedule of events the singles title going to Edith Coleridge, she also picks up the doubles title with Rose Collier, whilst the mixed event is won by the pairing of Clara Fletcher and Ernest Browne (himself winning both mixed titles at both major tournaments).\nAt the 1883 Wimbledon Championships the world's first major tennis tournament, it still remained an all men's event, no women's events were staged. At the U.S. National Championships there was still no women's championship events held.

        "title": "1928–29 Massachusetts Agricultural Aggies men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1928–29 Massachusetts Agricultural Aggies men's ice hockey season was the 21st season of play for the program. The Aggies were coached by Lorin Ball in his 5th season.\nSeason.\nOwing to weather conditions, coach Ball announced that the team's first practice wouldn't take place until after the winter break. Initially, only nine games were scheduled, however, after the break the Aggies received an invitation from a new opponent. Connecticut Agricultural, which hadn't played a game in nearly 20 years, was hastily trying to arrange a slate of game and gave MAC a chance to start the season in early January. Despite a distinct lack of practice time, the Aggies accepted and headed down to Storrs for their opening tilt. The match doubled as a training session with coach Ball using seven different forwards in the game but everything went in the favor of the Maroon squad. Newcomer Ed Frost led the Aggies with a hat-trick and helped the team win its first game in nearly two years. In one game, the Aggies had scored more goals than they had all of the previous season.\nAfter the fine start, MAC made its annual trip to New York, first taking on Hamilton. The game had to be moved to Utica due to issues with the Russell Sage Rink, however, that enabled the game to be viewed by tennis great Bill Tilden. With a renewed offense, MAC fought the Continentals on even turns throughout the evening. Twice Hamilton took the lead but both times MAC was able to quickly tie the match. After the Blue and Buff took their third advantage of the match, they managed to fend off the Aggies and remain ahead for the final period of play. In spite of the loss, MAC looked stronger than they had been in years and the team carried that belief into the next several games.\nArmy was next up for the Aggies and MAC had an easier time against the Cadets. Each of the starting forwards, Davis, Patch and Frost, scored in the game and pressured the Army cage to the point where the home team could barely get out of its own end. The defense got into the scoring action the next night against St. Stephen's. Bond opened the match about halfway through the first and Nash soon made the score 2–0. After a scoreless second, Myrick allowed the puck to get behind him but refused entry for the rest of the night. A second goal from Nash capped off the game and sent the team home in high spirits.\nUpon their return, the team found that the weather was playing havoc with the ice once more and had to play their next game on the local pond. Bates proved to be a tough opponent for the Aggies but the defense remained in fine form. Poor ice took some of the speed out of the game, as did the fading light, but solid teamwork allowed Frost to net the only marker of the game and capture their third win in a row. The team finally ran out of luck when Williams arrived the following day. Still forced to use the campus pond, the Aggies quickly found themselves down by a goal and were unable to match the Ephs. MAC played as well as could be expected and nearly tied the game in the third, however, when Manty hit a rolling puck towards the cage the puck bounced right over the crossbar. Myrick made 22 saves in an otherwise brilliant performance that saw the team's winning streak end.\nMAC's second road trip took the team up into Maine and they first met Bates for a rematch. With better ice conditions, the Aggies were able to get off to a hot start and score 4 goals in the first period. Bates closed the gap in the second but then exploded for 3 goals in the third period to take a 6–5 lead late. Part of the problem for the Aggies was that team captain Robby Nash had taken a puck to the face with about 5 minutes to play and was forced to leave the game. Just when it looked like MAC would lose, Manty scored his first goal of the season off of a rebound with just 30 seconds left and forced overtime. Waechter scored right at the start of the extra period and the team then played in a defensive shell to while away the rest of the 10-minute session. The next night, tired from the riotous Bates game, MAC played Bowdoin in a much more subdued affair. Because Nash was unable to play, Davis dropped back to take his spot on defense. Waechter played the entire game at center, however, with Frost also unable to go due to injury, the offense sputtered. David did play well on defense and limited the Polar Bears to just a single goal through two periods. Manty tied the match early in the third but a shot from center ice somehow eluded Myrick and ended up as the deciding goal, sinking the Aggies.\nBoth Frost and Nash were back for the next game but the offense was not. Playing on their home rink for the first time, the Aggies were again blanked, this time by New Hampshire. MAC took several runs at the UNH goal but the visitor's defense was too strong and stopped everything that the Aggies could give. Due to poor ice conditions, the game was limited to three 10-minute periods. A few days later the team took a trip across town to take on Amherst and the forwards were finally able to get back to scoring. After the Lord Jeffs opened the scoring, two goals from Frost gave MAC the lead early in the second. The rest of the period was dominated by Amherst and the score stood at 2–4 when the third began. Penalties caught up with the Sabrinas in the final frame and, while two players were off, MAC scored twice to tie the game. With just a few minutes remaining, however, Amherst got one more goal and managed to eke out a win over their cross-town rivals.\nNow sitting at .500, the team headed into their final game on the schedule still looking to post a winning record. Weather forced the game back onto the pond and was played early to allow for Colby to catch a train to Boston after the match. Frost was the center of the offense for the Aggies once more, scoring the opening goal in the first. A later shot of his was stopped but put home by Manty on the rebound. Myrick, meanwhile, played a solid game with help from the defense. Nash was injured in the match but, with no further games on the schedule, his availability was a moot point. After the game, however, a return match with the Connecticut Aggies was arranged. Though the game was played on the pond, the ice was in good condition and allowed MAC to display its superior team. Despite the stellar performance by the visiting goalie, the Maroon offense netted four goals and steadily built a comfortable lead. Myrick was heading towards another shutout but saw the bid end with just minutes to spare when the nutmegers finally got onto the scoresheet.\nThe 7 wins tied the program record set back in 1911 as the Aggies posted their first winning season in seven years.\nKendall Marsh served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "1925–26 Yale Bulldogs men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1925–26 Yale Bulldogs men's ice hockey season was the 31st season of play for the program. The Bulldogs represented Yale University and were coached by Clarence Wanamaker in his 5th season.\nSeason.\nWhile the team was coming off its second consecutive collegiate championship, the Bulldogs were still without a home. Plans for a replacement ice hockey rink in New Haven were put on hold when the replacement project went bankrupt. After last season's debacle with the Woodbridge Rink, Yale managed to arrange a deal with the operators of Madison Square Garden to use the large venue for the team's home games. the Elis' history of playing in New York City as well as a sizable contingent of alumni in the area likely made the prospect amenable despite the fact that Yale still had ice hockey classified as a minor sport. Similar to the year before, a few Bulldogs were already dealing with injuries from their time on the football team as Cutler was out with a knee injury while Noble was nursing a bum ankle.\nWhile the team had to contend with the loss of their star goaltender, the '26 squad knew that they had a capable understudy coming into the season. The bigger question mark was who would replace the two starting wingers who were now lost through graduation. The Elis were again allowed to use the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink as a practice facility prior to the winter break and were gearing up for a 4-game series with Williams up in Lake Placid. Cutler was still out with his ailment but Noble had recovered in time for the first game with the Ephs. The team played its first match just before New Year's and while their defense was still formidable, the offense was lacking. John Frey kicked off the scoring but the Elis were unable to summon up any further goals and fell to the purple 1–3. Yale performed better in the second match and despite losing Cole to a foot injury, were able to even the series. The third game was a close affair and the team was further degraded as Stout was playing through a cold. Even with that handicap the Bulldogs finished regulation in a tie. Ordinarily an overtime session would have been played but it was called off due to the onset of darkness. That left the fourth and final game as the deciding factor between the two teams. Yale attacked the Williams cage repeatedly but could get nothing past Chapman, instead, the Ephs' only goal from Popham gave them the victory.\nThe early losses made it unlikely that Yale could win a third consecutive championship, however, the team had little time to lick its wounds and the Elis found themselves on a train to Cleveland immediately after their 4th game. With little time to rest, the team took on the Cleveland Collegians, an amalgamation of former college players who were living in the region. The team was captained by former Bulldog David Ingalls and fell to the Elis, allowing the team to climb back up to .500. Two days later, Yale played its first game at Madison Square Garden against a vaunted McGill team. The Eli's oppressive defense led them to victory and gave hope to the fans that the early-season troubles were over.\nThe team had some time off before their next match and tried to sort out its offense. Stout was inserted as a starting winger instead of an injured Frey, however, all of their plans had to be thrown out as soon as the game started because Cottle broke a rib at the start of the game. The loss of both their starting wingers put Yale on the back foot and left the team unable to solve the Dartmouth defense. Near the end of the match, starting center Sam Ferguson was forced out with a knee injury, curtailing any real chance at a late tying goal. Cottle was able to return for the next game but Cole went back on the shelf, leaving the team without half of its starters. Even then the Elis gave Princeton a fight but couldn't overcome a sluggish start that saw them surrender a pair of goals in each of the first two periods. Frey got into the game in the latter stages, scoring the first goal for the Elis, but it was too little to late for the Bulldogs.\nYale got a bit of a reprieve and had a week and a half before their next match, giving the players some time to recover from their various injuries. While Ferguson was still out, Cole returned while Frey had seemingly fully recovered and was again a starting winger. The nearly-whole Elis swamped New York A. C. with Wheelock earning the shutout in place of Ives.\nAfter the exam break, the team returned with a rematch against Dartmouth. Wheelock was again starring in goal and had the Elis ahead by a single goal in the later part of the third period before the Indians finally broke through and opposing captain Manser notched a hat-trick in about 6 minutes to steal the game from Yale. The continued lack of scoring and practice time did not set the team up well for their showdown with Harvard, who were looking for revenge after missing out on the title the year before. Coach Wanamaker seemingly tried every lineup combination he could but nothing was able to get through the stingy Crimson defense and Harvard skated to a comfortable win.\nAfter a loss to the George Owen-led Boston A. A. squad, Yale ended it season attempting to win at least one of the Triangular League series. First up was the Princeton rematch, and while the team was at its full complement of players, the Elis didn't have much practice time beforehand. Frey got an early goal but Princeton answered quickly. The rest of the game saw several opportunities but neither netminder gave in. Overtime was needed but it too was scoreless until just before the full 5 minutes had elapsed when Princeton's Hallock notched his second of the match.\nComing into the final game against Harvard, Yale had little to play for other than pride but that didn't stop some 11,000 fans from attending the game. The Elis did what that had done all season; play solid defense but fail to get much going on the offensive side of the puck. The Bulldogs didn't make it easy for their hated rivals and fought them tooth and nail all game long. Unfortunately, they could never get past the Crimson defense and were shutout by Harvard for the second time that season. While injuries and lack of ice were primary malefactors in the team's season, Yale still ended with its worst record in over 20 years.\nW. H. West Jr. served as team manager with G. H. Walker as his assistant.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#00356B\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"

However, on July 26, it was announced McKee had pulled out of the bout due to medical issues and was replaced by current Rizin Lightweight Champion Roberto de Souza at a catchweight of 161 pounds.\nFor the co-main event, an inaugural Bellator Flyweight Championship bout between former Bellator Bantamweight Champion Kyoji Horiguchi (also former two-time Rizin Bantamweight Champion) and Makoto Takahashi took place at the event. If successful, Horiguchi would have become the fourth fighter in Bellator history to win a title in different divisions (after Joe Warren at Bellator 128, Ryan Bader at Bellator 214, and Patrício Pitbull at Bellator 221).\nA Rizin Bantamweight Championship bout for the vacant title between former Bellator Bantamweight Champion Juan Archuleta and former champion Kai Asakura was scheduled to take place at the event. Former champion Kyoji Horiguchi vacated the title on December 22 after moving down to the flyweight division. However on July 18 it was announced that Asakura withdrew due to injury and was replaced by Hiromasa Ougikubo."

The first season with four teams representing cities in India, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates is expected to take place in 2024.\nHistory.\nThe United International Baseball League was founded on July 26, 2022, with a mission of bringing professional baseball to India, Pakistan, and the Middle East. Baseball Hall-of-Famers Mariano Rivera and Barry Larkin were announced as founding stakeholders. Rather than build new baseball fields, the league plans to redevelop existing cricket fields into baseball diamonds.\nOn August 18, 2022, the UIBL announced that it would play nine of its inaugural games at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. In November, the UIBL announced it would rebrand to \"Baseball United\".\nBaseball United partnered with Pakistan Federation Baseball to organize the West Asia edition of the 2023 Asian Baseball Cup in Islamabad. In April 2023, active MLB shortstop Elvis Andrus joined the league's ownership group.\nOn May 15, 2023, the league announced its first franchise as the Mumbai Cobras. Former MLB All-Star Chris Sabo was named the team's first manager.\nOn May 30, 2023, the second team of the league was announced as the Karachi Monarchs. The Monarchs name references both the Karachi Kings cricket team, as well as the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro leagues. League officials said that the Monarchs and Cobras are expected to be the league's biggest rivals, noting the fierce India–Pakistan cricket rivalry and likening it to the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox. On June 5, 2023, Karachi appointed former major leaguers Adrian Beltre and Miguel Tejada as its general manager and manager, respectively. On August 4, 2023, The Baseball United announced Dubai Wolves and Abu Dhabi Falcons as their latest two baseball teams representing Dubai and Abu Dhabi.\nThe league's draft began on October 23, 2023. Karan Patel, a right-handed pitcher who reached Double-A in the Chicago White Sox organization, was selected first overall by the Mumbai Cobras. Prominent former MLB players drafted included Dominicans Robinson Canó and Bartolo Colon, Venezuelan Pablo Sandoval and Curaçaons Didi Gregorius and Andrelton Simmons.\nTeams.\nThe four teams that will take part in the first season are: "

        "title": "1927–28 Yale Bulldogs men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1927–28 Yale Bulldogs men's ice hockey season was the 33rd season of play for the program. The Bulldogs represented Yale University and were coached by Clarence Wanamaker in his 7th season.\nSeason.\nWith the New Haven Arena in operation from the start of the season, Yale was able to get a jump on their practice schedule and hit the ice at the beginning of December. The team brought in an enviable class of sophomores, headed by Ding Palmer to an already strong team, however, there were a few issues. Warner was dealing with a minor injury, Wilson was sidelined with a case of grippe and Ed Manville, who had been a starting defenseman last season, was academically ineligible for the first part of the season. There was hope, however, that he would be able to get into the lineup after the exams in early February. After just a week and a half of practice, the team played its first game against the University Club of Boston. The amateur team was seen as the best available outfit for the 1928 Winter Olympics but Yale still gave them a good fight. In a penalty-filled game, Palmer recorded a hat-trick and led the offense in his first game, however, the Eli defense wasn't yet up to snuff and allowed 8 goals to the prospective Olympians. The loss wasn't all bad as it didn't harm Yale's ability to compete for an intercollegiate title while showing some issues that the team still had time to address. Yale's second game wouldn't come until just before New Year's so coach Wanamaker had plenty of time to get his team into shape.\nDuring the winter break, Yale faced its first collegiate opponent of the season and was again led by the speedy Palmer. The sophomore winger scored 4 of Yale's 5 goals, doing so before 13 minutes had elapsed. The team then cruised to victory over the Eagles, demonstrating that their defense was much improved after three weeks of training. Shortly after classes resumed, the team met a very strong contingent from Toronto and gave the Canadians all they could handle. The two teams were evenly matched throughout the game and it wasn't until the waning seconds of the waning seconds gave Toronto the victory. Yale rebounded sharply after the narrow defeat and overwhelmed MIT in the next match, trouncing the Engineers on the strength of a 5-goal game from Palmer while Vaughan and Curtis each had hat-tricks.\nYale continued to dominate in the next four games as well with the top line consistently producing. Even in what was supposed to be an even match, the efforts of Palmer and his linemates, Vaughan and Cady, enabled the Elis to skate to a relatively easy victory. After a pair of wins in the middle of the week, Yale headed into the third weekend of January staring at its biggest test of the season. Dartmouth was having another good season and was expected to give the Bulldogs another tough fight for a collegiate championship. While the Indians were led by All-American Myles Lane, it was only though his efforts that the Greens weren't swept off the ice. Yale skated rings around the Dartmouth team with, once more, Palmer leading the way. The winger netted two goals and assisted on the game-winner from Vaughan as the Elis overcame the Indians for the first time in almost 3 years.\nThere was no letdown for the Bulldogs afterwards as the team ran roughshod over their next three opponents, averaging 10 goals per game. Palmer\n's 7-goal outburst against New Hampshire raised his season total to 31, making him one of the few college players ever to reach that mark in one season. Several alternates were used in the game but all of the scoring came from the top unit. Even the exam break didn't stop the juggernaut that was Yale hockey as the team rolled over both St. Nicholas Hockey Club and Bates before heading up to New Hampshire for the return match with Dartmouth. While the game was limited to just 15 minute periods, the two teams still gave those in attendance a tremendous game. Both clubs were fast and provided a ton of offense but the two netminders, Hurd and Bott, were both sparkling in goal. Palmer continued his torrid scoring pace by recording all 4 of Yale's tallies. Though Dartmouth fought desperately to tie the score in the third, they were unable to match the Elis and the Bulldogs swept the season series.\nAfter a second win over St. Nick's, the Elis avenged one of their early losses by overpowering the University Club of Boston. Palmer led the way one more with a 4-goal effort and had the team in contention for the intercollegiate championship. In the following game, the rematch with Princeton, another 4 goals from Palmer made his season the stuff of legend. That outburst raised his total on the year to 52, becoming the first person in the history of American college hockey to reach the half-century mark. Not only had he score more goals than anyone else but Palmer's average of 2.88 goals per game was slightly more than Hobey Baker had managed during his best season (1912–13). As of 2023, in the entirety of college hockey, only one player (Phil Latreille) has averaged more goals per game over the course of a full season.\nThe win was also the 13th consecutive victory for the Elis and set them up as the favorites for the championship as they headed into the showdown with Harvard. It was an old story between the two as the Elis' high powered offense tried to break through the impenetrable Crimson defense. Morrill, possibly the best goaltender in the country, continually kept Yale from scoring in the first and allowed Giddens to open the goal in the later part of the period. Neither team managed to score in the second but Curtis was finally able to break through with the tying marker early in the third. Shortly afterwards, a scrum in front of the Yale net resulted in Hurd taking a skate to the face. The laceration was bad enough for him to miss the rest of the game and Winston Sizer was cast in the role of reluctant hero. Despite coming in cold, the understudy made several key saves to keep Harvard from scoring and sent the game into overtime. Unfortunately, Yale's luck ran out in the extra period and the go-ahead goal was jammed into the cage by Harvard captain, John Chase. Now with a lead, Harvard pulled back and played defense for the rest of the overtime and Yale was unable to skate through the 5-man front.\nYale had to travel north for the rematch a week later and were met by a hostile crowd. As they had done in the first game, Harvard made sure to keep a tight lid on Palmer and stymied the speedy winger all game long. Yale was unable to get any sort of offense going early and the lack of punch allowed Harvard to score twice in the opening frame. Hurd and the defense stiffened afterwards but the offense was unable to get anything into the Harvard cage. What few opportunities the Elis were able to generate, all were stopped by Morrill and Yale's tremendous season ended in disappointment at the hands of their hated rivals.\nJ. K. Curtis served as team manager with G. H. Parker as his assistant.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#00356B\" | Regular Season"

The two schools are among the most storied in women's basketball history with Tennessee holding 8 national championships (2nd all-time) and Stanford with 3 (T–3rd all-time). Former Tennessee coach Pat Summitt and former Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer are among the winningest coaches in the sport. They have played each season since 1988 with the exception of 2020, due to COVID-19 travel concerns and 2023, with Tennessee leading the all-time series 25–14.\nSeries History.\nThe rivalry began in 1988 when both schools were at the top of women's basketball, with Tennessee claiming national championships in 1987, 1989, and 1991, with Stanford winning in 1990 and 1992. For Stanford, Tennessee is their most played non-conference opponent, while the series ranks fourth for Tennessee (behind series with Texas, Louisiana Tech and Old Dominion). The schools have met three times in the NCAA basketball tournament, playing in the 1991 Final Four, 2004 Elite 8, and in the 2008 national championship, all games won by Tennessee. They are the first (Tennessee) and fifth (Stanford) in all-time women's basketball wins, and throughout out their 39 meetings, at least one school has been ranked in the AP poll each time and both teams have been ranked 36 times. The two teams have met three teams as the #1 and #2 teams in the nation (twice in 1992, and 1994), with Tennessee leading 3–0 in these games. The rivalry long centered on the close friendship between legendary coaches Tara VanDerveer and Pat Summit, with the games carrying a strong level of respect between the programs. Tennessee dominated the early years of the rivalry highlighted by an eleven-game winning streak that ran from 1997 until 2006. Since the end of that run, Stanford has found more success against Tennessee, leading 10–6 since 2007, and winning 7 out of 10 games since Pat Summit's retirement at the end of the 2011–12 season.\nRival accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs.\nResults.\nSources"

        "title": "Boxing in Puerto Rico",
        "text": "The history of the sport of boxing in Puerto Rico is a varied and extensive one. Boxing is a major sport in the Caribbean country, and the sport has produced many champions for the island, both in the amateur and professional ranks, and among men and women fighters.\nPrestigious boxing publication Ring Magazine has considered Puerto Rico as, pound per pound, the best boxing nation in the world.\nAs of 2023, there were 13 Puerto Ricans inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in Canastota, New York, all of them men. Of these, 11 were former boxers, with one being a former referee and one a writer. In December 2023, Ivan Calderon became the 14th Puerto Rican to be elected to the International Boxing Hall of Fame; he will be inducted in June 2024.\nBoxing in Puerto Rico is overseen by the Puerto Rican Boxing Commission, whose president in 2021 was Jorge Colón Colón.\nBeginning of boxing in Puerto Rico.\nLike other sports, such as baseball and basketball, boxing was first introduced to Puerto Rico by the U.S. Military at places such as Camp Las Casas (now Residencial Las Casas) in San Juan. Nero Chen, who died from tuberculosis in 1924, was the first Puerto Rican to register as a professional boxer. He traveled to New York City for fights.\nBroadcasts of Jack Dempsey fights to the island by radio brought interest in boxing to Puerto Rican sports fans. Boxing in Puerto Rico was first legalized by governor Horace Mann Towner in 1927. Governor Mann Towner, an American, signed into law in May of that year a proposal that had been first carried by Puerto Rican legislator, don Lorenzo Coballes Gandía, who suggested to him that the sport be legalized in the island. Subsequently, the \"Primera Comisíon Atletica de Boxeo\" (\"First Boxing Athletic Commission\") was formed to oversee rules and regulations of the sport in the island, and the \"Estadio Universal\" (\"Universal Stadium\") opened in San Juan as the first venue to offer regular boxing shows, with the first fight there being between the then future Venezuelan national Bantamweight champion, Enrique Chaffardet, and an opponent named Al Clemens. That contest was declared a draw or tie by the scoring judges. Soon after, stadiums were also built around the island, many of which had regular boxing shows to attract spectators.\nSixto Escobar era.\nSixto Escobar was a Puerto Rican professional boxer. He debuted as a professional on Thursday, July 17, 1930, at the Victory Garden Stadium in San Juan, knocking out Luis Emilio Perez in two rounds as part of a show headlined by a bout between José Quelin Angulo and Octavio Almonte (a fight which Angulo won by second-round knockout).\nEscobar began getting international attention and moved to Venezuela, where he lost to Chaffardet in an attempt to lift that country's national Bantamweight title.\nOn June 26, 1934, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, Escobar beat Mexican boxer Rodolfo Casanova to win the vacant world Bantamweight title, recognized by the Montreal Athletic Commission, thus becoming the first boxer from Puerto Rico to achieve recognition as a world champion and, unbeknown-sly at the time, ushering in the Mexico - Puerto Rico boxing rivalry. Escobar beat Tony Marino by thirteenth-round knockout at the Dyckman Oval in Manhattan, New York, to gain universal recognition as a unified Bantamweight world champion.\nEscobar went on to become a national hero in Puerto Rico and lost and recovered the Bantamweight title twice afterwards.\nCocoa Kid.\nConcurrently with Escobar's world titles run, Herbert \"Cocoa Kid\" Hardwick, a Black Puerto Rican from Mayaguez, became the \"Colored Welterweight Champion\" when he knocked out Young Peter Jackson in round two of a fight held at Heinemann Park in New Orleans, Louisiana on Saturday, July 26, 1936, in a fight refereed by the legendary former Heavyweight contender and also International Boxing Hall of Fame member, Harry Wills. Hardwick defended the title successfully against Holman Williams on June 11, 1937, at the Coliseum Arena in New Orleans by winning a 15-rounds unanimous decision. He defended the title successfully once more before losing it to Charley Burley, losing a fifteen-rounds unanimous decision to Burley on Monday, August 22, 1938, at the Hickey Park in Millvale, Pennsylvania. Cocoa Kid, Burley and Williams were each members of a group of Black boxers who were dubbed as the Murderer's Row, who were known both for their ability as well as for their inability to secure fights for world titles held by other boxers not in that group. Hardwick, Burley and Williams were all later elected to the IBHOF.\nDespite the considerable talent of the title's holders, in modern times, the Colored Welterweight Championship is generally not considered as a world title by most boxing fans and historians alike.\nPedro Montanez.\nPedro Montanez, from the central Puerto Rico city of Cayey, was another outstanding Black Puerto Rican boxer of the time. Unlike Hardwick, however, he was not a member of boxing's murderer's row, and he was allowed to compete for regular world titles. Montanez debuted on Sunday, February 1, 1931, at the Victory Garden in San Juan by beating the undefeated Antonio Melendez by six-rounds decision as part of a program headlined by a young Escobar himself.\nMontanez's victory over Felix Perez on Wednesday, March 7, 1934, at the Salón Nuevo Mundo in Barcelona, Spain, a seventh-round knockout win, set off a streak of 50 consecutive fights in which he did not lose; he went 49–0–1 during that streak, the lone tie being against Saverio Turiello of Italy over ten rounds at Milan's Teatro Puccini on Monday, April 15, 1935. Among others, during that streak, he beat Bobby Pacho, Aldo Spoldi, Frankie Klick, Enrico Venturi, Lou Ambers, Wesley Ramey and Freddie Cochrane.\nThat undefeated streak came to an end when Montanez challenged Ambers for the world Lightweight title as part of a program that included three other world title fights (Marcel Thil vs. Fred Apostoli, Sixto Escobar vs. Harry Jeffra and Barney Ross vs. Ceferino Garcia) on Thursday, September 23, 1937, at the Polo Grounds in New York City. In a close match, Ambers was able to edge the Puerto Rican by a fifteen-rounds majority decision to retain the world championship. The New York Times agreed with the decision, but in Puerto Rico at least, Montanez was called an \"uncrowned champion\".\nMontanez went on about keeping his status as a contender and hoping to become Puerto Rico's second world boxing champion; he then embarked on another undefeated streak after the title-fight loss to Ambers, this time reaching 22 bouts without a loss, with only one tie among the wins he got during that sequence. He defeated, among others, Jimmy Garrison, International Boxing Hall of Fame member and former world Junior Welterweight champion Jack Kid Berg (a fifth-round knockout win for Montanez on Friday, March 10, 1939, at the New York Hippodrome) and Young Peter Jackson at the Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles, California on Tuesday, April 25 of the same year.\nThat latter streak also came to an end, but this time it was in a controversial way: boxing against Davey Day on Thursday, May 23, 1939, at the Madison Square Garden in New York, Montanez was even on the scorecards when the fight was stopped in round eight in favor of Day, therefore Montanez took an eighth-round technical knockout defeat. The stoppage was due to a cut Montanez suffered on one of his eyes. The New York Times claimed that Day was \"clearly beaten\" and that the crowd \"jeer(ed) thunderously\". But the Chicago Tribune disagreed with that stance, publishing that \"Day's victory was a popular one\" and that most ringsiders felt the fight was tied before the stoppage, and the Hartford Courant expressed their opinion that the fight was tied when it ended.\nMontanez nevertheless kept his march towards a second world title fight. He won three more fights, then faced the immortal, International Boxing Hall of Fame member, three-division world champion Henry Armstrong for Armstrong's world Welterweight title on Wednesday, January 24, 1940, at the Madison Square Garden in New York, at a show promoted by Mike Jacobs. Armstrong had won 103 of 122 previous fights, and that night, proved to be the best of the two future International Boxing Hall of Fame inductees, knocking out the Puerto Rican star in round nine to retain the belt. Montanez had one more contest and then he retired with 90 wins, 9 losses and 4 ties to his ledger, becoming a popular figure in Puerto Rico and specially in Cayey, where his nickname, \"El Torito\" (\"The Bull\") was adopted by the town as the city's secondary demonym and several sports teams are now named after him.\n1960s and 1970s.\nCarlos Ortiz from Ponce, Puerto Rico, moved to New York City at an early age and later established himself as a professional boxing prospect in the Junior Welterweight division. He became Puerto Rico's second world champion by knocking out Kenny Lane in two rounds to win the vacant Junior Welterweight world title on June 12, 1959, at New York. He defended that title twice, but after losing it to someone he had beaten previously in a title defense, Duilio Loi in a rematch, and failing to recapture it in a third fight with Loi, Ortiz moved down to the Lightweight division and won that title by beating Joe Brown on points on April 21, 1962, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Being that the era of major boxing title fights in Las Vegas was just beginning, Brown-Ortiz was one of the first major fights to take place at the Southwest American desert's city. Ortiz lasted as Lightweight champion until 1968; including losing the title and regaining it against Panamanian Ismael Laguna. Ortiz, like Escobar before him, inspired a large number of Puerto Rican youngsters to take up boxing as a sport.\nJosé Torres followed Ortiz as the third Puerto Rican to win a world title, when he knocked out Willie Pastrano in nine rounds on Tuesday, March 30, 1965, at the Madison Square Garden in New York city to win the undisputed world Light-Heavyweight championship. In doing so, he also became both the first Hispanic world Light-Heavyweight champion and the first Afro-Puerto Rican to win a world boxing championship.\nThe 1970s are generally considered the beginning of the golden era of boxing in Puerto Rico, an era that lasted until almost the 1990s, due to a number of factors. On December 31, 1972, Puerto Rico's largest sports hero up until that time, baseball player Roberto Clemente, died in a plane crash, leaving the island in need of a new sporting hero. In January 1973, Roberto Clemente Coliseum was opened; it was named after him. The first main event bout to be held at that coliseum was a February 15, 1973, world championship fight, when the WBA's world Junior Welterweight champion, Colombian Antonio Cervantes, faced Puerto Rican challenger Josue Marquez, the Colombian retaining the title by a fifteen-rounds unanimous decision despite having a brief scare in round three when he was floored but the fall was not counted as a knockdown against him. The coliseum has hosted, as of early September 2023, 104 professional boxing shows, many of them featuring world title and other important fights including the likes of Muhammad Ali, Panamanian Roberto Duran, Wilfredo Gomez, Wilfred Benitez, Hector Camacho, Alfredo Escalera, George Foreman, Mexican Carlos Zarate the also Panamanian Eusebio Pedroza and others. Gomez and Zarate fought their bout there on October 28, 1978, (Gomez retained his WBC world Super-Bantamweight title by a fifth-round knockout in a fight that is considered pivotal in the Puerto Rico-Mexico boxing rivalry) and the also Mexican Julio Cesar Chavez fought one of his pre-world champion days fights there, beating Javier Fragoso on May 1, 1983, as part of the undercard of a program whose main event was a contest between Edwin Rosario of Puerto Rico and Chavez's stablemate and countryman, Jose Luis Ramirez, which Rosario won by unanimous decision in twelve rounds to lift the WBCs vacant world Lightweight title.\nMeanwhile, the Hiram Bithorn Stadium, adjacent to the Roberto Clemente Coliseum, was also contributing to this era in Puerto Rico's boxing history. That stadium has seen 71 boxing events including fights by Rosario, Benitez, Gomez, Azumah Nelson, (including the fight between Gomez and Nelson on December 8, 1984) Alexis Arguello, and the August 7, 1983, contest between Camacho and Mexico's Rafael Limon, fought for the WBC's vacant Junior Lightweight title and which Camacho won by fifth-round technical knockout.\nOn September 1, 1973, José Roman became the first Puerto Rican to challenge for the world Heavyweight title. He lost that day to George Foreman by a first-round knockout in Tokyo, Japan.\nThe fight between Ali and Jean Pierre Coopman, which took place February 20, 1976, at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum, was the only time a world Heavyweight championship fight was contested in Puerto Rico; it was won by Ali by a fifth-round knockout. Elsewhere, the first fight between Arguello and Escalera, the so-called \"Bloody Battle of Bayamon\", was fought on Saturday, January 28, 1978, at the Juan Ramon Loubriel Stadium in the San Juan neighboring city of Bayamon. Considered by many fans and experts as a classic, the bout, for Escalera's WBC world Junior Lightweight title, was won by Nicaragua's Arguello by a thirteenth-round technical knockout.\nBenitez's gym-mate, Esteban De Jesus, also formed part of this era. On Friday, November 17, 1972, he became the first boxer to defeat the feared, World Boxing Association's world Lightweight champion Duran, winning by ten-rounds unanimous decision, after dropping Duran in round one, in a non-title affair held at the Madison Square Garden in New York, and beginning the Duran-De Jesus trilogy of fights. Duran and De Jesus rematched with the WBA world Lightweight title on the line on March 16, 1974, at the Gimnasio Nuevo Panama (now Roberto Duran Arena, named after Duran); the WBC title was not on the line as it was now held by Rodolfo Gonzalez, who had beaten Chango Carmona for that title. In a tremendous fight, De Jesus again dropped Duran in round one, but Duran got up and dropped De Jesus in round seven before stopping him in round eleven to retain the crown. Rodolfo Gonzalez, meanwhile; lost the WBC title to Ishimatsu Suzuki, who, in turn, lost it to De Jesus, who became the WBC world Lightweight champion by outpointing the Japanese boxer over fifteen rounds at the Juan Ramon Loubriel Stadium in Bayamon on Saturday, May 8, 1976. De Jesus defended his title successfully three times and won one non-title bout, setting the long-awaited third match with Duran, which was fought on January 21, 1978, in Las Vegas as an unification match for the WBA and WBC world Lightweight titles. The third time around, Duran dominated a valiant De Jesus and won by a twelfth-round technical knockout. De Jesus would fight on until 1981 when, afflicted by drug addiction, he murdered a teenage boy. He was sentenced to life in prison but was diagnosed with HIV during the middle 1980s, becoming the first world champion boxer to die of AIDS disease in 1989, but not before being pardoned by Puerto Rico governor Rafael Hernandez Colon and then released from jail, later receiving a public visit and a hug from his former ring nemesis Duran.\nOn Saturday, March 6, 1976, Benitez made history by becoming the youngest world boxing champion ever when, at the age of 17, he beat Colombia's Antonio Cervantes by a fifteen-rounds split decision, for Cervantes' WBA's world Junior Welterweight title at the Hiram Bithorn Stadium.\nSamuel Serrano won the WBA's world Junior Lightweight title by defeating Ben Villaflor by a fifteen-rounds unanimous decision on Saturday, October 16, 1976, at the Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan. With Alfredo Escalera having won the WBC world Junior Lightweight title on Saturday, July 5, 1975, by knocking out Kuniaki Shibata in two rounds at Nara, Japan, the two boxers made history by becoming the first two Puerto Ricans to hold world titles simultaneously in the same division, a feat that would be repeated many times thereafter by other Puerto Rican boxers.\nAlso in 1975 but on Saturday, June 28 at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan, one week before Escalera's world championship victory, Angel Espada of Salinas, beat Clyde Gray of Canada to lift the WBA's vacant world Welterweight title, a belt that had been stripped from Cuban Jose Napoles for failing to defend it against Espada. With Espada and Escalera's wins, Puerto Rico, having had only 3 world champions previously, almost doubled its amount of world champions in the space of a single week, from three to five.\nOn May 21, 1977, at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan, Gomez recuperated from a first-round knockdown to defeat South Korean WBC world Super-Bantamweight champion Dong Kyun Yum, winning his first of three titles, later beginning a string of 17 world title defenses, all won by knockout, the streak of knockouts in world title defenses constituting a world record in boxing.\nIn November 1979, Sixto Escobar died, becoming the first Puerto Rican world champion boxer to pass away. Also in November 1979, on Friday, November 23rd. specifically, Willie Classen of Santurce, Puerto Rico, fought Wilford Scypion at the Felt Forum in New York City. Classen lost the fight by a tenth-round technical knockout and later died from his injuries, becoming the first Puerto Rican professional boxer ever to die of injuries caused during a contest.\n1980s.\nBy the start of the 1980s, the popularity of professional boxing in Puerto Rico was largely influenced by the Puerto Rican boxers of the day and also by Puerto Rican television networks such as WAPA-TV, Telemundo Puerto Rico, Teleluz and others, which carried both international and local fights regularly. Bouts such as Wilfredo Gomez vs. Lupe Pintor and Wilfred Benitez vs. Thomas Hearns, Aaron Pryor vs. Alexis Arguello, Salvador Sanchez versus Azumah Nelson, Larry Holmes vs. Tim Witherspoon and the two Michael Dokes vs. Mike Weaver contests (Holmes vs. Witherspoon and the Dokes vs. Weaver rematch were both on May 20, 1983) and Ray Mancini vs. Bobby Chacon were telecast live and free of charge; television commentators for these fights included Rafael Bracero, Luis Rigual, Junior Abrams and Norman H. Davila. Local fights, if a world title was being disputed, were carried on national television days after they had taken place, to encourage public attendance to those events. The latter were, however, carried live on radio stations. Television boxing broadcasts in Puerto Rico were typically sponsored by such brands and companies as Ron Palo Viejo, Bacardi, Pizza Hut, Eastern Airlines, Deportes Salvador Colom, Don Q, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and others. These brands and companies hoped that viewership of the boxing contests would help them recoup their small investment in the upcoming days, weeks and months.\nBy 1980, both Benitez and Gomez were considered national heroes by most Puerto Rican boxing fans and their celebrity had reached mainstream status.\nNew talents began to emerge in the 1980s for Puerto Rican professional boxing. These included Juan Laporte, who debuted in 1977 Edwin Rosario, who debuted in 1979 and Hector Camacho, who debuted in 1980.\nOn May 21, 1981, Benitez became the first Latino to become a three-division world champion as well as the youngest boxer to do so, when he knocked out WBC world Junior-Middleweight champion Maurice Hope in twelve rounds at the Caesar's Palace Hotel in Las Vegas, lifting that championship.\nA monumental moment in the history of the boxing rivalry between Puerto Rico and Mexico took place on August 21, 1981, also at the Caesar's Palace Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, when Wilfredo Gomez, the WBC world Super-Bantamweight champion who was undefeated in 33 fights, with one tie, and all 32 wins coming by knockout, challenged Mexican Salvador Sánchez, the WBC world Featherweight champion who had a record of 40 wins, 1 loss and 1 tie in 42 bouts, with 30 wins by knockout, for the latter's world title. Sanchez established himself early by dropping Gomez in round one, and although Gomez tried very hard to turn the fight around, Sanchez won the bout by an eighth-round knockout in a fight that is remembered as a pivotal one in the rivalry.\nAnother historical moment for Puerto Rican boxing took place a few months after Sánchez-Gomez, when, on November 14, 1981, also in Las Vegas but this time at the Showboat Hotel and Casino, Wilfred Benitez took on future IBF world Junior-Middleweight champion Carlos Santos, Benitez defending the WBC world Junior-Middleweight title. This bout was significant because it pitted two Puerto Ricans fighting for a world championship, it being the first instance when such a pairing took place in boxing history. Benitez scored a flash knockdown in round six on his way to retaining the title by a 15-rounds unanimous decision, in a fight that was televised by HBO Boxing.\nBenitez was back fighting on HBO when he next defended the title, in a \"super-fight\", a major contest between two super-stars, when he faced legendary Panamanian Roberto Duran at the Caesar's Palace Hotel to defend his WBC world Junior-Middleweight title. Benitez retained the title by outpointing Duran, winning by a fifteen-rounds unanimous decision on Saturday, January 30, 1982.\nMeanwhile, Carlos De Leon had won the WBC's world Cruiserweight title on November 25, 1980 by beating champion Marvin Camel in New Orleans, Louisiana. When Ossie Ocasio won the vacant WBA world Cruiserweight title by beating Robbie Williams by a fifteen-rounds split decision at Johannesburg, South Africa on Saturday, February 13, 1982, not only did Ocasio become the WBA's inaugural world champion in that division, but De Leon and Ocasio, who were personal friends, became the second pair of Puerto Ricans to hold world titles at the same division simultaneously, after Escalera and Serrano. De Leon lost his title in 1982 to ST Gordon but regained it from the same fighter in 1983, while Ocasio held his title until 1984, so De Leon and Ocasio repeated the feat. De Leon was also the first boxer to win a world Cruiserweight title two, three and four times, as he kept losing and recapturing his belt through the 1980s, setting and breaking his own record for most times as world Cruiserweight champion.\nOn December 3, 1982, Gomez and Benitez fought in the same program for the first time, Gomez defending his WBC world Super-Bantamweight title against WBC world Bantamweight champion Lupe Pintor of Mexico and Benitez defending his WBC world Super-Welterweight title against former WBA world Welterweight champion Thomas Hearns of the United States. Gomez-Pintor forms another well-known chapter in the boxing rivalry between Mexico and Puerto Rico Gomez retained the title with a 14th-round technical knockout victory, completing his 17th defense of that title, all of which were won by knockout. On the other hand, Hearns outpointed Benitez, winning the WBC world Super-Welterweight title by a fifteen-rounds majority decision. Another Puerto Rican named Wilfredo who would later join Benitez and Gomez as a three-division world champion and form part of the history of boxing in Puerto Rico, Wilfredo Vazquez, was also scheduled to fight at the program, held at the Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana, but he had to cancel his contest because of an injury which he suffered in training for it. Gomez-Pintor and Benitez-Hearns were both showcased live on HBO Boxing.\nIn 1983, former light-heavyweight champion of the world José Torres was elected to serve as New York State Athletic Commission commissioner. He served on that position until 1985.\nThe death, in November 1982, of boxer Duk Koo Kim after a fight against Ray Mancini led the WBC to shorten their world-title fights from fifteen rounds to twelve, starting in 1983. On Sunday, February 20, 1983, WBC world Featherweight champion, the Guayaman Juan Laporte, who resided in New York City, defended his title against Mexican-American Ruben Castillo at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan, in the first-ever world championship fight to be scheduled for twelve rounds in the country. In the fight, which constituted another chapter of the Puerto Rico and Puerto Rican-Americans versus Mexico and Mexican-Americans boxing rivalry, Laporte dropped Castillo twice en route to a twelve-rounds unanimous decision victory. Rafael Solis and Mexican great Rene Arredondo also won fights in that boxing show. Laporte had won the championship left vacant by the death of Mexican legend Salvador Sánchez.\nOn November 18, 1983, Hector Camacho defended his WBC world Junior Lightweight title against Rafael Solis in another HBO Boxing-televised event. While Wilfred Benitez and Carlos Santos had staged the first world title fight involving two Puerto Ricans and Camacho-Solis was the second fight for a world title involving two Puerto Ricans, since Benitez was born in New York, Camacho-Solis became the first world title fight in boxing history involving two boxers who were native of Puerto Rico, as Camacho was born in Bayamon, while Solis was born in the San Juan ward of Rio Piedras. In a bout held at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum, Camacho retained his title by a fifth-round knockout. Solis was attempting to become part of the first pair of Puerto Rican brothers to be world champion boxers; his brother Julian, had been WBA world Bantamweight champion in 1980.\nOn Sunday, March 11, 1984, Mark Medal, an American of Puerto Rican descent, won the IBFs inaugural world Junior Middleweight championship bout, stopping Earl Hargrove in five rounds to lift the vacant title at the Sands Casino and Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey. With this victory, Puerto Rico surpassed Panama for third place on the list of countries with the most world boxing champions.\nMajor boxing events continued being telecast in Puerto Rico live and free of charge by Puerto Rican networks from the mid to the late 1980s; these included Thomas Hearns vs. Roberto Duran, Hearns vs. Marvin Hagler, Hagler vs. Sugar Ray Leonard, Leonard's third fight with Roberto Duran, Wilfredo Gomez vs. Juan Laporte, Azumah Nelson and Rocky Lockridge,(the three latter contests re-transmitted on television days after they took place, since they were all held in San Juan) Jose Luis Ramirez vs. Hector Camacho Sr., Donald Curry vs. Milton McCrory, Julio Cesar Chavez vs. Rocky Lockridge, Chavez's challenge of Edwin Rosario, Duran's challenge of Iran Barkley and many Mike Tyson contests, including his major fight with Michael Spinks, his world Heavyweight title unification fight with Tony Tucker, Larry Holmes' challenge of him, the first Tyson-Bruno match and, also, Hector Camacho vs. Ray Mancini.\nOn June 13, 1986, a fight that divided Puerto Ricans, both in Puerto Rico and elsewhere, and also international boxing fans, took place at the Madison Square Garden in New York, as the main event of a program that also included a world title defense by Julio Cesar Chavez and an early career Mike Tyson contest. Televised on HBO Boxing, the fight between Puerto Ricans Hector Camacho and Edwin Rosario was for Camacho's WBC world Lightweight championship, which Rosario was trying to recover. In a classic match, Camacho overcame tough patches in rounds five and eleven to eke out a 12-rounds split decision and retain the title, The result of the fight has been argued by fans ever since and remains a controversial topic among boxing fans and experts alike.\nOn Friday, September 26, 1986, the WBA's world Lightweight champion, Livingstone Bramble, defended his title against Rosario and Hector Camacho defended his WBC world Lightweight championship versus the former WBC world Junior-Lightweight champion, Uganda's Cornelius Boza-Edwards. The two fights were co-promoted by Don King and Miami-based promoters Willy Martinez and Felix Zabala. Don King's intentions were for Bramble and Camacho to win and then for King to stage a unification bout between those two; the program was actually named \"preamble to Bramble\"; however, Rosario knocked Bramble out that night at the Abel Holtz Stadium in Miami Beach, Florida, in round two, while Camacho dropped Boza-Edwards in round one en route to a 12-rounds unanimous decision victory. Camacho and Rosario thus imitated Escalera and Serrano and De Leon and Ocasio before them in being Puerto Rican boxers who held world championships in the same division at the same time. A rematch between them seemed imminent, but it never took place. Those fights were also televised by HBO Boxing.\nBy this time, Wilfred Benitez and Wilfredo Gomez were already out of world championships pictures; Benitez having fought his last world title match against Hearns in 1982 and Gomez against Alfredo Layne in May 1986. Camacho, Rosario, Wilfredo Vazquez and, to a lesser extent, John John Molina and Juan Carazo represented the new stars of Puerto Rican boxing.\nAlso in 1986, Ivonne Class became the first Puerto Rican female professional boxing promoter. Many of her shows at that era began to be televised on Puerto Rico's Tele-Once television channel, which became another major supporter of boxing on television at the country during that era and later began showing many world title bouts including Mike Tyson fights. Another well-known Puerto Rican boxing promoter was former Major League Baseball pitcher José \"Pantalones\" Santiago.\nOn Sunday, October 4, 1987, Wilfredo Vazquez won his first of three world championships, when he knocked out defending WBA world Bantamweight champion Chan Young Park in ten rounds at the Hilton Hotel in Seoul, South Korea.\nIn 1988, the World Boxing Organization (WBO) was established after a group of men broke away from a WBA convention at Isla Margarita, Venezuela. The WBO soon established itself in San Juan, becoming the first major world championships sanctioning body to hail from Puerto Rico.\nOn Saturday, April 29, 1989, John John Molina won the WBO's vacant world Super-Featherweight (Junior-Lightweight) title, outpointing former WBC world Featherweight champion Juan Laporte with a twelve-rounds unanimous decision at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan to conquer the first of what would be a number of world championships. On that same program, another Puerto Rican, Jose Ruiz, would conquer the WBO's vacant world Super-Flyweight title, by beating former WBC world champion, Colombia's Sugar Baby Rojas. For his part, Caguas' Carazo, who had recently defeated Argentina's legendary Santos Laciar by a twelve-rounds spilt decision, fought Mexico's Gilberto Roman for the Mexican's WBC world Super-Flyweight title on Monday, June 5, 1989, at the Great Western Forum in Inglewood, California. Despite dropping Roman in round four and being one second away from being crowned world champion (as Roman got up from that knockdown at the count of nine out of a ten-seconds count), Carazo lost that bout by twelve-rounds unanimous decision.\nOn September 9 of that same year (1989), Ruiz would defend his WBO title against Carazo, knocking him out in the first round at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan.\n1990s: Macho Time, Titomania.\nIn 1990, then-current Puerto Rican boxing standouts included John John Molina, Wilfredo Vazquez, Hector \"Macho\" Camacho Sr., Edwin Rosario, and Rosario's nemesis Juan Nazario.\nEarly in 1990, a small controversy ensued between Felix Trinidad Sr., a former national Featherweight champion in Puerto Rico, and the Puerto Rican Boxing Commission, regarding the possible participation of Trinidad Sr.'s son, Felix Trinidad, at the 1992 Barcelona, Spain, Summer Olympics, the Trinidads taking the decision of having Felix Jr. become a professional boxer instead. On March 10, 1990, Trinidad Jr., debuted as a professional boxer, knocking out the also debuting Angel Romero in round two at Miramar ward, San Juan, Puerto Rico.\nAlso in 1990, former world light-heavyweight champion José Torres of Ponce was elected as president of the surging World Boxing Organization; although at the time the WBO was not considered a major world boxing sanctioning body by either the three other sanctioning groups, boxing magazines or fans, eventually, with Torres' and with Francisco Varcarcel's help, it was, therefore Torres became the first Puerto Rican person to be president of one of professional boxing's four major recognizing bodies. Torres was president of the WBO until 1995.\nOn Wednesday, April 4, 1990, at the Madison Square Garden in New York, Nazario beat Rosario by an eighth-round technical knockout, lifting the WBA world Lightweight championship and avenging a loss that Rosario had, coincidentally, inflicted him in the same round and for the same title but in Chicago, Illinois two and a half years before. This had been Rosario's third term as world Lightweight champion. The Rosario-Nazario rematch was televised by HBO Boxing.\nOn Saturday, August 11, 1990, Camacho Sr. successfully defended his WBO world Junior-Welterweight title by beating his personal friend, Tony Baltazar by a twelve-rounds unanimous decision at the Caesars Tahoe hotel in Stateline, Nevada. That same evening and at the same location, Nazario fought Pernell Whitaker, trying to unify his WBA world Lightweight title with the WBC and IBF ones, which were held at the time by Whitaker. In a rare show of power by him, Whitaker stopped the Puerto Rican, winning by first-round knockout.\nOn February 23, 1991, Camacho lost his WBO world Junior-Welterweight title to Greg Haugen in a fight at the Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. Camacho and Haugen were close on the scorecards, but a moment in round twelve when Camacho refused to touch gloves with his challenger proved costly: Camacho was deducted a point by referee Carlos Padilla and as a consequence, he lost the fight by scorecards of 113–114 and 112–114 against him and a 114–112 for him. Haugen allegedly had an illegal substance found on his body during the after-fight urinalysis, and the result was over-turned into a no-contest; the WBO retained Haugen as their champion; the result was again overturned into a Camacho loss after Camacho's 1992 contest with Julio Cesar Chavez Sr. Camacho-Haugen I is considered a boxing classic by such outlets as ESPN.\nHaugen and Camacho had an immediate rematch, held on May 18, 1991, at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center in Reno, Nevada. The second time, Camacho dropped Haugen in round eleven and edged out an equally close, split decision to reclaim the WBO world Junior-Welterweight title, with scores of 115–112 and 114–113 for him and 112–115 against him. The possible match between him and Julio Cesar Chavez Sr. was now one of the most hotly anticipated fights of the era by then.\nOn Friday, June 14, 1991, Rosario beat Loreto Garza by way of a third-round knockout to win his fourth world championship and his second divisional title, the WBA world Junior-Welterweight championship, in a contest which was carried on HBO Boxing's Pay-Per-View leg, TVKO. This fight took place at the Arco Arena. in champion Garza's hometown of Sacramento, California. This was Rosario's last win of significance; he soon lost his title to Akinobu Hiranaka of Japan and faced drug and alcohol problems. Rosario died in December 1997.\nOn October 4, 1991, Ponce's Alex Sanchez debuted by beating Carlos Figueroa by a first-round knockout at the western Puerto Rican city of Mayaguez, in a Minimumweight bout. Sanchez would later emerge as a lower-weights star and also establish himself as a mainstream celebrity in the island.\nIn 1991, Carlos Ortiz became the first Puerto Rican boxer to be elected into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.\nAnother monumental moment in the history of the Puerto Rico-Mexico boxing rivalry took place when Julio Cesar Chavez defended his WBC world Junior-Welterweight title against Hector Camacho, in a contest that gained great attention in Mexico, Puerto Rico and internationally. Camacho's WBO world Junior-Welterweight title was not at stake because at the time, the WBC did not recognize the WBO as a world boxing sanctioning entity. Chavez pressured Camacho relentlessly, ultimately winning by a 12-rounds unanimous decision and retaining his belt. That fight was held on Mexican Independence Day's weekend, on September 12, 1992, at the Thomas and Mack Center, also in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nNine months later, another Puerto Rican, Felix Trinidad Jr., became the 30th Puerto Rican boxer to become a world champion, when he beat defending IBF world Welterweight titlist Maurice Blocker by a second-round knockout to lift the championship at the Sports Arena in San Diego, California on Saturday, June 19, 1993. Camacho himself fought in the program, which was televised in the United States by the Showtime Network's Showtime Championship Boxing show. In the program, Camacho beat Tom Alexander by a seventh-round technical knockout.\nTrinidad's win over Blocker began a title reign that saw him defend his championship 15 times over the next six years, adding the WBC championship along the way.\nOn Wednesday, December 22, 1993, the fast-rising star, Alex Sanchez, became the WBO's world Minimumweight champion, defeating Orlando Malone for the vacant belt at the Caribe Hilton Hotel in San Juan by a first-round knockout. Eventually, a match-up between him and Mexican Ricardo Lopez would become one of the most anticipated ones among the lower weights in the decade.\nDommys Delgado Berty, a Puerto Rican boxing administrator, became a WBO supervisor in 1993; she first supervised a WBO world championship fight when she went to Zaragoza, Spain, to supervise a bout between her countryman, WBO world Super-Bantamweight champion Daniel Jimenez and the Spanish challenger Felix Garcia Losada from Pamplona, contest which took place on Friday, October 29, at Zaragoza's Pabellon Principe Felipe. Puerto Rico's Jimenez won that fight to retain his title, by a fifth-round technical knockout. Delgado Berty would later become one of the main female personalities in Puerto Rican boxing (see below).\nOn January 29, 1994, Trinidad made both his Las Vegas and his Pay-Per-View boxing debut when he faced Camacho with Trinidad's IBF world Welterweight title on the line. Unlike on his previous challenge of Chavez, (where he was merely trying to win another world championship belt in a division in which he had already won world championships twice) Camacho this time was attempting to become a member of the four divisions world champions group. This fight was viewed by boxing fans as a sort of passing the torch type of fight, between a legend from the past decade in Camacho and a future star in Trinidad. It was fought as part of a program headlined by Chavez's WBC world Junior-Welterweight championship bout against American Frankie Randall (a bout in which Chavez suffered his first loss in ninety fights, by a twelve-rounds split decision). Trinidad beat Camacho by unanimous decision to retain his championship, with scores of 116–110, 119–106 and 117–109, all in Trinidad's favor.\nOn September 3, 1994, Daniel Jiménez established a world record for the quickest knockout in a championship fight, defeating Harald Geier in 17 seconds (currently the second fastest).\nBy the mid-1990s, Puerto Rican boxing stars included Trinidad Jr., Wilfredo Vazquez Sr., John John Molina, Daniel Jiménez, Alex Sanchez, Daniel Alicea and Josue Camacho. Hector Camacho Sr., and Edwin Rosario, meanwhile, were veterans who were still active, in Rosario's case, until his death in December 1997. Also by this time, Molina had been a three-time world Junior-Lightweight champion, as WBO and then IBF champion in 1989 when he beat first Juan Laporte and then Tony Lopez, and then in 1992, when he beat Jackie Gunguluza in South Africa. Continuing the Mexico (and Mexican-American) versus Puerto Rico (and Puerto Rican-American) boxing rivalry, Molina challenged Oscar De La Hoya for De La Hoya's WBO world Junior-Welterweight championship, at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas on Saturday, February 18, 1995. Molina gave the young champion a good fight; some fans and critics alike even suggested he should have won it by a close margin, including HBO Boxing's Harold Lederman. De La Hoya, however, retained the belt by a twelve-rounds unanimous decision.\nOn Saturday, May 18, 1996, Wilfredo Vazquez fought Venezuelan Eloy \"Kiki\" Rojas for Rojas' WBA world Featherweight title. Deeply behind on the scorecards, Vazquez rallied to score a spectacular, highlight-reel film eleventh-round knockout to win the world title. Having beaten Chang-Yong Park for the organization's world Bantamweight title in 1987 and Raul Perez in 1992 for the organization's world Super Bantamweight title, Vazquez made history by becoming the first three-division world champion to win all three titles with the same organization in boxing history.\nOn March 1, 1997, Hector Camacho faced Sugar Ray Leonard for the lowly-regarded, International Boxing Council's Middleweight championship. There were speculations that the winner of this fight would face the winner of the upcoming, WBC world Welterweight title match between Pernell Whitaker and Oscar De La Hoya. Camacho won the match, sending the illustrious Leonard into retirement by knocking him out in five rounds at the Convention Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey, giving the American his first knockout loss in a fight televised on Pay-Per-View.\nOn Saturday, April 12, 1997, De La Hoya beat Pernell Whitaker by a 12-rounds unanimous decision to win the WBC's world Welterweight title. The bout itself did not have particular meaning as far as the history of boxing in Puerto Rico, but it had repercussions, because soon, De La Hoya would meet the challenge of three Puerto Ricans, Wilfredo Rivera and legends Camacho Sr. and Trinidad Jr.\nThe longly awaited-for unification bout between Sanchez and Mexican legend, the undefeated (46–0) Ricardo Lopez, took place on Saturday, August 27, 1997, at the Madison Square Garden in New York city, once again igniting the Mexico-Puerto Rico boxing rivalry. Lopez dominated a brave but overmatched Sanchez, knocking him out in round five to retain his WBC world title and add the WBO one to it.\nWith a record of 51 wins, 0 losses and 1 draw (tie), Lopez later retired as a boxing legend and one of the very few world champions ever to retire undefeated.\nOn September 13, 1997, once again at Mexican Independence Day weekend, Oscar De La Hoya defended his WBC world Welterweight title against Héctor Camacho Sr., who was once again attempting to join the exclusive group of four-division world champions, in a Pay-Per-View event from the Thomas And Mack Center in Las Vegas. De La Hoya dominated the contest, nicknamed \"Opposites Attack\", despite Camacho's resilience and courage, dropping Camacho in round nine on his way to a comfortable, 12-rounds unanimous decision victory. By this time, clamor for a unification fight between the young stars, De La Hoya and Trinidad, was growing.\nOn Saturday, April 18, 1998, Vazquez challenged the legendary boxer from England, Naseem Hamed, for Hamed's WBO world Featherweight title. Hamed was making his tenth title defense. Vazquez had been a world traveler in his world championship fighting days, including fights in Mexico, Spain, France, Japan and the United States. Hamed dominated Vazquez before stopping him in round seven of the last major fight in Vazquez's career, at the Nynex Arena in Manchester, England.\nOn February 13, 1999, Oscar De La Hoya defeated former WBA world welterweight champion Ike Quartey of Ghana by a twelve-rounds split decision in a tremendous war at Las Vegas' Thomas and Mack Center, to retain his WBC world welterweight title. This contest was shown on HBO Pay-Per-View. The next week, Felix Trinidad defended his IBF world welterweight title against a legendary but faded rival, former four-division world champion Pernell Whitaker at the Madison Square Garden in New York city, in a fight carried live on HBO Boxing. Trinidad dropped Whitaker and dominated the bout, winning by a rather easy twelve-rounds unanimous decision to retain the belt, further cementing the seeds for a super-fight showdown between the two young superstars and world welterweight champions.\nBy then, Trinidad's popularity was growing in Puerto Rico; he was now a crossover celebrity and the worshipping he received from some of his fans began to receive the nickname of \"Titomania\".\nAfter De La Hoya further defended his title against Oba Carr by eleventh-round knockout on Saturday, May 22, 1999, at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, and Trinidad defended his against Colombian Hugo Pineda by a fourth-round knockout seven days later, on May 29 at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan, the stage was set for the major super-fight between the two world champions. An international press-tour that saw the two visit Puerto Rico, the United States and Mexico, among other places, ensued, while the fans awaited for the contest to take place.\nTheir fight finally took place on September 18, 1999, once again near Mexican Independence Day. It was held at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. Trinidad-De La Hoya was for Trinidad's IBF belt and De La Hoya's WBC belt. It was a controversial bout; the fight's result was still being debated decades later. De La Hoya apparently thought he had built a lead large enough so that the fight was his after round nine, but Trinidad became more aggressive after that round and closed the fight winning the last three rounds on the scorecards which proved pivotal in his securing a majority-decision victory with scores of 115–113 and 115–114 for him, and a 114–114 tie. With the victory, Trinidad defended his IBF belt for the fifteenth time and annexed the WBC one. Thousands of his fans celebrated the win in Puerto Rico, and he was the object of a large welcoming at Luis Munoz Marin International Airport and all the way from there to his house in Cupey the next day. De La Hoya-Trinidad is also considered a chapter of the Mexicans-Puerto Ricans boxing rivalry.\nBy the late 1990s, the landscape of programming showing free professional boxing fights had changed in Puerto Rico: most major fights were shown on the Pay-Per-View system, largely leaving WAPA-TV and Telemundo to showing occasional local programs as free television boxing.\n2000s: Trinidad, Cotto, Ruiz.\nIn March 2000, Trinidad moved up in weight and challenged the WBA world Junior Middleweight champion David Reid, their fight coming on March 3 at the Caesar's Palace Hotel in Las Vegas. Shown on the Showtime network's Pay-Per-View, the bout was won by Trinidad, who was dropped once in round three but who recuperated to drop Reid once in round seven and three times in round eleven. Trinidad prevailed by a twelve-rounds unanimous decision with two scores of 114–106 and one of 114–107 to capture a world title at a second division. Like after the De La Hoya contest, Trinidad was the object of a large welcoming by fans from the airport to his home in Cupey.\nMeanwhile, John Ruiz, an American of Puerto Rican descendance, was getting attention as a Heavyweight contender. After Lennox Lewis defeated Evander Holyfield for the WBA, WBC, and IBF heavyweight titles in late 1999, the WBA ordered Lewis to defend the title against mandatory challenger Ruiz, but Lewis refused. Though he had been undefeated since his 1st round 19 second loss against David Tua in 1996, the level of competition Ruiz had been facing was suspect and the only fighter with a recognizable name he had beaten (to date) was a nearly 40-year-old former IBF world champion Tony Tucker.\nRuiz and his management sued, claiming that WBA rules entitled him to a title shot. A judge agreed, but rather than face Ruiz in a bout that was seen as commercially unattractive, Lewis instead fought Michael Grant, considered to be a very worthy contender at the time, having knocked out a series of recognized \"name\" opponents on HBO. After learning of this, the judge decreed that upon entering the ring against Grant on April 29, 2000, Lewis would automatically forfeit the WBA title.\nOn Saturday, August 12, 2000, Ruiz became the third Puerto Rican to fight for a world Heavyweight title (joining José Roman and Ossie Ocasio, who had challenged Larry Holmes for the WBC title in 1979) when he took on Holyfield for the WBA's vacant championship at the Paris Las Vegas hotel in Las Vegas. Holyfield won a unanimous but controversial decision, with two scores of 114–113 and a 116–112 for Holyfield, thus continuing a historical futility for Hispanic boxers in attempting to conquer a world Heavyweight title that had seen such notables as Roman, Ocasio, Argentina's Luis Angel Firpo, the Basque Country's Paulino Uzcudun, Chile's Arturo Godoy, Uruguay's Alfredo Evangelista, the French-Moroccan of Spanish descent Lucien Rodriguez, Cuba's Jorge Luis Gonzalez and, now, Ruiz, compete for such a belt but fail.\nAt the same time, interest was growing for a fight between Felix Trinidad and IBF world Junior Welterweight champion Fernando Vargas, which, like Trinidad-De La Hoya, would also become a chapter of the Puerto Rico (and Puerto Rican-Americans) boxing rivalry against Mexico (and Mexican-Americans). Their bout came on Saturday, December 2, 2000, at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. In a spectacular fight, Trinidad dropped Vargas twice in round one, then got dropped in round four before dropping Vargas again, three times, in round twelve to unify his WBA world title with the IBF one by way of a twelfth-round technical knockout victory. As it was common by now, Trinidad received a large welcome at San Juan's airport from his fans after the contest.\nOn Saturday, February 17, 2001, future star Ivan Calderon debuted as a professional boxer at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. Calderon, a Minimumweight who would become a two-division world champion, knocked out Sergio Diaz in the first round that night.\nSix days later, Friday, February 23, 2001, marked the debut of another future Puerto Rican legend, Miguel Cotto. Cotto, who had unsuccessfully participated at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, representing Puerto Rico, fought that night at the Frank Erwin Center in Austin, Texas, facing Jason Doucet in a Junior-Welterweight contest. Cotto won by first-round knockout.\nThe WBA, meanwhile, ordered a rematch between their world Heavyweight champion, Evander Holyfield, and John Ruiz. Their second fight took place on Saturday, March 3, 2001, at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. This time, Ruiz became the first Hispanic in boxing history to become world Heavyweight champion when he dropped Holyfield in round eleven and went on to win the fight, and the WBA's world Heavyweight title, by a 12-rounds unanimous decision, with scores of 118–110, 115–111 and 114–111, all for him.\nOn Saturday, May 12, 2001, as part of Don King's Sugar Ray Robinson Trophy tournament to unify the world Middleweight championship, Felix Trinidad challenged WBA world Middleweight champion William Joppy at the Madison Square Garden in New York City. Trinidad dominated the bout, dropping the courageous champion Joppy in rounds one, three and five on his way to join boxing's exclusive group of three-division world champions by winning by a fifth-round technical knockout. Trinidad became the first ever Puerto Rican world Middleweight champion. With Trinidad's victory, added to Ruiz's victory two months before, Puerto Rico became the first country in history to have at least one world champion in every boxing division. Trinidad was once again received by his fans at San Juan when he returned to the island.\nFelix Trinidad and Bernard Hopkins were to fight in a contest to unify Trinidad's WBA and Hopkins' IBF and WBC Middleweight world titles on Saturday, September 15, 2001, at the Madison Square Garden in New York city as the conclusion of Don King's Sugar Ray Robinson Trophy Tournament. The fight was, however, postponed due to the tragic events of September 11, 2001 in New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania, when four jetliners, two of which belonged to American Airlines and to United Airlines each, were deliberately crashed on those locations, killing almost 3,000 people. The fight was contested on September 29 instead, when Hopkins defeated Trinidad by a twelfth-round technical knockout, unifying the titles and inflicting what many feel was the biggest loss by a Puerto Rican boxer since Salvador Sánchez beat Wilfredo Gomez back in 1981. Despite Trinidad losing, thousands still lined the streets in Puerto Rico the day after to welcome him back.\nJohn Ruiz retained the WBA world Heavyweight title on Saturday , December 15, 2001, in a third fight with Evander Holyfield by way of a twelve-rounds draw (tie) at the Foxwoods Resort in Mashantucket, Connecticut, then against Canada's Kirk Johnson by a tenth-round disqualification on Saturday, July 27, 2002, at the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas, before losing it to Roy Jones Jr. by a twelve-rounds unanimous decision on March 1, 2003, at the Thomas and Mack Center in Las Vegas.\nOn Saturday, May 3, 2003, at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, Ivan Calderon won the first of his two world titles, when he faced the WBO world Minimumweight champion, Nicaragua's Eduardo Ray Marquez and defeated him by a ninth-round technical decision to win the championship, as part of a Pay-Per-View televised card headlined by a fight between Oscar De La Hoya and former IBF world Junior Middleweight champion, Yory Boy Campas.\nJohn Ruiz regained the WBA title when Jones Jr., who was Light-Heavyweight champion, decided to return to the Light-Heavyweight division instead and the WBA named Ruiz interim WBA Heavyweight champion. Ruiz defended this title by beating former world Heavyweight champion Hasim Rahman by a twelve-rounds unanimous decision on Saturday, December 13, 2003, as part of an HBO Boxing Pay-Per-View show held at the Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\nAlso in 2003, Dommys Delgado Berty became the first woman Puerto Rican Boxing Commission commissioner. Her career as a commissioner lasted from 2003 to 2017, a span in which she oversaw 100 boxing shows.\nRuiz was instated as the WBA's full champion after beating Rahman; his next defense, against Puerto Rico's Fres Oquendo, was double-historic in the sense that not only was it the first time two Puerto Ricans fought for a world Heavyweight championship but also the first time two Latino boxers did. Ruiz vs. Oquendo took place on Saturday, April 17, 2004, at the Madison Square Garden in New York and was part of a program that also included Chris Byrd vs. Andrew Golota for Byrd's IBF world Heavyweight title; it was shown live in the United States on Pay-Per-View. Ruiz retained the title by beating Oquendo by an eleventh-round knockout.\nOn Saturday, September 11, 2004, Miguel Cotto, a native of Providence, Rhode Island, but who had relocated to Caguas, Puerto Rico and is Puerto Rican by parental lineage, fought for his first world title. Cotto faced old amateur nemesis Kelson Pinto of Brazil for the WBO's vacant world Junior Welterweight championship at the Jose Miguel Agrelot Coliseum in San Juan, on that night. Wearing boxing shorts that bore the names of all other Puerto Ricans who had become world champion boxers previously, Cotto dominated the fight and stopped the Brazilian in six rounds to become a world champion himself, the first of many world titles that saw him also become a fan favorite in Puerto Rico and a mainstream celebrity, and get inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.\nYet another star during this era was Daniel Santos, who had conquered the WBO world Welterweight title on Saturday, May 6, 2000, by knocking out Akhmed Kotiev in five rounds at the Swisshotel in Neuss, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany. Santos kept winning world title fights through the decade and was a standout performer. Juan Manuel López was also garnering attention; he debuted on Saturday, January 29, 2005, at the Ruben Rodriguez Coliseum in Bayamon, knocking out Luis Daniel Colon in round one.\nThe Lopez-Colon match was part of a program that was headlined by a much larger, attention-getting contest between Puerto Ricans Alex Sánchez, the former WBO world Minimumweight champion, and Nelson Dieppa from the Puerto Rican archipelago's island of Vieques, who, as WBO world Light-Flyweight champion, was the first world champion ever out of that island. Just like Trinidad-Camacho a decade earlier, many Puerto Ricans saw this world title fight as a passing-of-the-torch event; the former star boxer (Sánchez) versus a current star (Dieppa). Dieppa retained his championship by an eleventh-round knockout.\nMiguel Cotto relinquished the WBO world Junior-Welterweight title in late 2006 and announced his intention to move to the welterweight division to fight Carlos Quintana for the WBA's vacant championship. The fight took place on December 2, 2006. Cotto defeated Quintana by technical knockout in the fifth round. Following a punch to the body, Quintana surrendered prior to the start of the sixth round and Cotto won the vacant World Boxing Association Welterweight championship. This was also a major fight for Puerto Rican boxing fans, as both were quality performers who hit hard, and Quintana offered a chance for Puerto Rico to have another world champion, while Cotto was already being seen in the island and internationally, as a potential legend in the making.\nAnother major fight took place on Saturday, January 19, 2008, when Felix Trinidad Jr. attempted a return to boxing, against former multiple-times world champion Roy Jones Jr., in a fight that many fans and experts alike thought should have taken place nearly a decade before. Both legends took a long press conferences tour before the fight to garner fan interest for it. In an HBO Boxing Pay-Per-View event which was held at New York's Madison Square Garden, Jones dropped Trinidad twice and won by a twelve-rounds unanimous decision, in what constituted Trinidad's last boxing fight as a professional.\nFebruary 9, 2008, was the first time that boxers from Puerto Rico had held three of the four major welterweights titles (World Boxing Association, International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Organization) when Carlos Quintana defeated Paul Williams to become the WBO champion and join Miguel Cotto (WBA), and Kermit Cintron (IBF) as champions in the division.\n2008 was also the year in which another chapter of the Puerto Rico-Mexico boxing rivalry was added, as the longly anticipated fight between Miguel Cotto, the WBA world welterweight champion, and Tijuana's Antonio Margarito, the former IBF and WBO champion, took place on July 26, 2008, at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, and it was telecast on HBO's Pay-Per-View. Cotto and Margarito fought one for the ages; many fans considered it a great fight. Cotto largely controlled the first half of the fight and was ahead on all the three judges' scorecards after six rounds, but Margarito came on in the second half and injured Cotto's face, leading to an eleventh-round technical knockout victory for the Mexican.\nSoon after, however, doubts were cast over Margarito's win against Cotto. On his next contest, which was held on January 24, 2009, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, Margarito got beaten by a ninth-round knockout by Shane Mosley to lose his welterweight title. Before that fight, one of Mosley's trainers, who was in Margarito's dressing room overseeing his hand-wrapping process, noticed a substance that looked like plaster of Paris, a cement-like element, near Margarito's hands. It was widely believed that Margarito used this on some of his previous fights, including the first Cotto one. The latter rumors were never confirmed, but they were enough to warrant their rematch later on.\n2010s: Cotto, Garcia.\nThe 2010s for Puerto Rican boxing began with John Ruiz's final attempt at recapturing a world heavyweight title. On Saturday, April 3, 2010, Ruiz faced the heavy-hitting, WBA world heavyweight champion David Haye for the Englishman's belt at the M.E.N. Arena in Manchester, England. Despite putting on a hard, valiant effort, Ruiz was stopped in nine rounds. He retired after this bout.\nBy the early 2010s, Puerto Rican boxing championship hopefuls included Danny Garcia and Jose Pedraza.\nOn April 18 and 19, 2010, a tragic event that had little impact as far as boxing in Puerto Rico but set a chain of events that would affect a chapter of the Puerto Rico versus Mexico rivalry took place in Venezuela: On April 18, Venezuelan boxer Edwin Valero, a two-division world champion whose record was of 27–0, with all 27 wins by knockout, killed his wife in Valencia, Venezuela. Then on the 19th, he was found dead by suicide after hanging himself at a Venezuelan jail cell. Valero was widely expected to fight Manny Pacquiao in a super-fight next.\nAfter Valero died, Pacquiao was left without an opponent, so Antonio Margarito stepped up and took the chance to fight the Filipino legend. Their fight took place on November 10, 2010, at the AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, near Dallas. Margarito took a beating, lasting the twelve rounds distance but having an injury to his right eye socket and a fractured orbital bone, for which he was transported by ambulance to a nearby hospital after the bout, after losing the contest, which was for the WBC's vacant world Welterweight title, by a twelve-rounds unanimous decision.\nCotto had won the WBA's vacant world super-welterweight title by knocking out Yuri Foreman in nine rounds at the Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, New York on Saturday, June 5, 2010, in the first ever world title fight held at the new Yankee Stadium, on an HBO Boxing telecast show. Cotto next retained that title against Nicaraguan Ricardo Mayorga, winning by twelfth-round technical knockout on Saturday, March 12, 2011, at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, in a bout that was televised internationally; it was carried in Australia by the Main Event channel, in Hungary by Sport 2, in Mexico by Azteca TV, in Poland by Polsat Sport Extra and in the USA, by the Showtime Network's Showtime Championship boxing.\nThe aforementioned events set in motion negotiations for a rematch between Cotto and Margarito. Many among the boxing fans and connoisseurs viewed this as a perfect moment for Cotto to avenge the earlier loss to Margarito which had been put in doubt due to the findings before Margarito's fight with Shane Mosley.\nTheir rematch took place on Saturday, December 3, 2011, at the Madison Square Garden in New York, despite initial reservations by the NYSAC to license the bout due to Margarito's eye condition. Bob Arum, the fight's promoter, threatened to take the fight to another state where Margarito was licensed to fight and hold it there. The commission had denied Margarito a license to box on October 31, 2011, due to that eye condition, but it ultimately licensed him and allowed the fight to take place. There was huge hype surrounding the contest; it was the subject of an HBO documentary series, \"Cotto-Margarito: 24/7\" which followed the two boxers during their training for the contest, and also of a \"Face/Off\" HBO television show, where both of them came face to face alongside host Max Kellerman and where both made claims about Margarito's hand wraps on their previous bout: Cotto had pictures of Margarito's wraps after it and alleged Margarito had used plaster of Paris on their first meeting, while Margarito and his trainer Javier Capetillo argued they were innocent. In any case, Cotto dominated the fight, widely leading on all three scorecards when it was stopped before round ten by doctors due to an injury to Margarito's eye, Cotto retaining the WBA world Junior Middleweight title by a ninth-round technical knockout.\nCotto's next contest was another major, Pay-Per-View production: he faced Floyd Mayweather Jr., widely considered among the greatest boxers of all time, on Saturday, May 5, 2012, at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, defending his WBA world Junior Middleweight title and fighting for the WBC's vacant \"silver\" version of the same championship. In a highly competitive fight, Mayweather imposed himself by twelve-rounds unanimous decision.\nPuerto Rican boxers who were modern stars during that era included Cotto as well as Garcia and Pedraza.\nIn 2012, Puerto Rican professional boxer Orlando Cruz made history by becoming the first professional boxer to come out as gay during his professional career. While other boxers, such as Panama Al Brown and Emile Griffith, had lived gay, bisexual or lesbian lives outside the ring, none of them had declared themselves members of the LGBT community while still boxing.\nGarcia was another Puerto Rican-American (born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania). Danny Óscar Garcia first won a world title when he defeated the legendary but shopworn Mexican, Erik Morales, by twelve-rounds unanimous decision in another fight in the long list of fights between Puerto Ricans or Puerto Rican-Americans and Mexicans or Mexican-Americans. The contest between Morales and Garcia, for the WBC's vacant world Junior-Welterweight title, was fought on Saturday, March 24, 2012, at the Reliant Arena in Houston, Texas. It was telecast to various countries, including Hungary, Australia, Mexico on Televisa and the United States on HBO. Garcia won by wide scores of 118–109, 117–110 and a closer 116–112 in his favor, after flooring Morales in round eleven.\nOn Saturday, July 14, 2012, Garcia added another important victory to his record when he stopped England's Amir Khan to win the WBA's \"Super\" version of the Junior Welterweight title, adding it to his WBC one, in four rounds at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Khan was floored once in round three and twice in round four before the bout was stopped. This contest was televised internationally to the United States on HBO, to Australia on Main Event and to Hungary on the Sport 1 channel.\nGarcia and Morales had a rematch, on Saturday, October 20, 2012, at the Barclay's Center in Brooklyn, New York, with Garcia retaining his WBA and WBC titles by knocking out Morales in round four of a scheduled 12-rounds contest. This was Morales' last fight after a long, illustrious career of 61 fights, of which he had won 52, including victories over Puerto Ricans or boxers of Puerto Rican descent such as Kevin Kelley and Angel Chacon.\nOn November 20, 2012, a tragic event that shook Puerto Rican society took place, when Puerto Rican boxing legend, former three-division world champion Hector Camacho was shot outside a bar in Bayamon, Puerto Rico, alongside a friend of his. Both men died, in Camacho's case, 4 days after the shooting took place.\nMiguel Cotto, meanwhile, had one last super-fight win in his career: on Saturday, June 7, 2014, at the Madison Square Garden in New York, he stopped the legendary Argentine boxer Sergio Martinez to win the WBC world Middleweight title. Cotto dropped the valiant Argentine three times in round one before winning in round ten.\nBy this time, José Pedraza was starting to make waves in the world of professional boxing. On Saturday, June 13, 2015, at the Bartow Arena in Birmingham, Alabama, Pedraza won his first world title by outpointing Andrey Klimov over twelve-rounds for the IBF's vacant world Junior Lightweight championship. The fight was telecast in Panama and in the United States, in the latter country on the Showtime Network.\nChristopher Diaz was another prospect during this time.\nMiguel Cotto's last super-fight was also a chapter in the long history of the Puerto Rico-Mexico boxing rivalry: faced with Guadalajara's superstar, Saul \"Canelo\" Alvarez to defend his Ring Magazine-recognized world Middleweight title and fight for the vacant WBC one, on Saturday, November 21, 2015 (a date that has proven to be of poor luck to Puerto Ricans against Mexicans as Edwin Rosario had lost to Julio Cesar Chavez on the same date but in 1987) at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Paradise, Nevada (near Las Vegas) Cotto lost by twelve-rounds unanimous decision in a contest that was scored widely in favor of Alvarez by all three judges but which experts, including those of ESPN, saw as a much closer affair albeit still favoring the Mexican. But while this was his last super-fight, it was not his last major one as he still had two world title fights ahead of him before retiring.\nOn Saturday, January 14, 2017, José Pedraza faced hard-hitting Gervonta Davis to defend his IBF world Junior-Lightweight belt. Pedraza put on a good fight against his undefeated challenger but ultimately wound up losing the world title by a seventh-round knockout. This bout, held at the Barclay's Center in Brooklyn, New York, was televised live to the United States on the Showtime Network as well as to Panama and the United Kingdom.\nSaturday, March 4, 2017, marked another important date in Puerto Rican boxing history, as on that day, Danny Garcia faced Keith Thurman in a contest to unify Thurman's WBA and Garcia's WBC world Welterweight titles. This was the third fight in history to unify Welterweight titles, after 1981s Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Thomas Hearns and the aforementioned contest between Trinidad and De La Hoya. In a closely contested fight, Thurman was able to pull-out a split-decision victory over twelve-rounds at the Barclay Center in Brooklyn, New York.\nOn Saturday, August 26, 2017, Cotto dominated Japan's Yoshihiro Kamegai to win the vacant WBO world Super Welterweight Championship, by unanimous decision after twelve one-sided rounds at the StubHub Center in Carson, California, winning by scores of 120–108, 119–109 and 118–110, all in his favor. It would be the last win and championship of Cotto's-who had taken over from Felix Trinidad as the face of Puerto Rican boxing-career.\nPedraza and Raymundo Beltran ingrained themselves into the Mexico vs. Puerto Rico boxing rivalry's history when, on Saturday, August 25, 2018, they faced each other for Mexican Beltran's WBO world Lightweight title at the Gila River Arena in Glendale, Arizona, in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area. Pedraza became a two-division world champion when he dropped Beltran in round eleven and won by a twelve-rounds unanimous decision with two scores of 117–110 and one of 115–112 in his favor. The bout was televised nationally in the United States by ESPN.\nDecember 2, 2017, marked Cotto's retirement date. On that night, he defended his WBO world Junior Middleweight title against Sadam Ali, at the Madison Square Garden in New York, in a fight that was televised to the United States on HBO Boxing and to Mexico on Televisa, as well as to other countries of Latin America on Canal Space. Cotto lost that fight by a close but unanimous decision, marking the end of his Hall of Fame career.\n2020s.\nOn May 9, 2022, five suspects, all men, were arrested in connection to the 2012 shooting death of Hector Camacho, the legendary Puerto Rican boxer. The police announced that two other suspects had been murdered themselves.\nOn Saturday, February 25, 2023, Subriel Matias of Ponce, Puerto Rico, lifted his professional boxing record to 19 wins and 1 loss, with all 19 wins coming by knockout, by stopping the until then undefeated Jeremias Ponce (30–0) to win the vacant IBF world Junior Welterweight championship at the Armory at Minneapolis, Minnesota. Matias thus won another world title for Puerto Rico and he represents a new promise for Puerto Rico's boxing scene. The bout was telecast live on Showtime Championship Boxing.\nWomen's Boxing.\nOn Saturday, September 12, 1998, Melissa Del Valle made double history, both as the first Puerto Rican woman to be crowned a world champion boxer and as a member of the first pair of Puerto Rican siblings who were world champions, along with her brother Lou Del Valle, when she beat Melinda Robinson to claim the vacant Women's International Boxing Federation's world Junior Lightweight title at the Miccosukee Indian Gaming Resort in Miami, Florida, by a ten-rounds unanimous decision. Del Valle's brother Lou had been the WBA's world Light-Heavyweight champion between 1997 and 1998, when he lost to Roy Jones Jr. by unanimous decision after dropping Jones Jr. in round seven. The Del Valle siblings missed being world champions concurrently by mere months.\nOn January 19, 2001, Ada Vélez made history by becoming the first native Puerto Rican woman (Melissa Del Valle was born in the United States) to win a world boxing championship when she beat Kathy Williams to win the International Boxing Association's women's world Bantamweight championship at the Soaring Eagle Casino in Mount Pleasant, Michigan. She won the fight by ten-rounds unanimous decision.\nBy far the most accomplished Puerto Rican woman boxer until 2023 has been Amanda Serrano. Serrano, whose sister Cindy Serrano is also an accomplished boxer, fought at the Aviator Sports Complex in Brooklyn on Saturday, September 10, 2011, against Kimberly Connor of Waskom, Texas, for the IBF's vacant women's world Junior Lightweight title, and she lifted the championship by way of a second-round technical knockout. On Friday, April 27, 2012, Serrano fought Frida Wallberg for Wallberg's WBC women's world Lightweight title at the Cloetta Center in Linkoping, Sweden and lost by a close but unanimous ten-round decision.\nOn Saturday, February 16, 2013, Amanda Serrano boxed Wanda Pena Ozuna at the Gran Arena del Cibao in Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic. Serrano lifted the Women's International Boxing Association world Featherweight title, which was vacant until then, by a first-round knockout. Serrano added the WBO women's world lightweight title by defeating Maria Elena Maderna by a sixth-round knockout on Friday, August 15, 2014, in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nSerrano, who through her career has been able to move between weight divisions without much trouble, next went down to the Featherweight division again, and conquered the until then vacant WBO world Featherweight title by knocking out Olivia Gerula in round one on Wednesday, February 17, 2016, at the BB King Blues Club and Grill in New York City. Serrano went down yet one more weight division when she faced Alexandra Lazar of Hungary for the WBO's vacant women's world super-bantamweight title, and brought Puerto Rico another world title in that category (like Wilfredo Gomez, Victor Callejas and Wilfredo Vazquez before) at the Caribe Hilton Hotel in San Juan on Tuesday, October 18, 2016, knocking the European boxer out in round one to lift that belt.\nA few months later, Serrano added the WBC Diamond version of their women's Super-Bantamweight title while at the same time successfully defending her WBO version of the world title, defeating Yazmin Rivas by ten-rounds unanimous decision as part of the aforementioned Davis-Pedraza fight's under program, at the Barclay's Center in Brooklyn.\nOn Saturday, April 22, 2017, Serrano went down in weight again and won the until then vacant WBO world Bantamweight title by beating the Dominican Republic's Dahianna Santana by an eighth-round technical knockout at the Barclay's Center in Brooklyn. The title was on the line for Serrano only as Santana had come into the bout over the fight's weight limit.\nContinuing her title-winning ways, Serrano fought Yamila Esther Reynoso of Argentina for the WBO's vacant women's world Junior-Welterweight title on Saturday, September 8, 2018, at the Barclay's Center. Serrano won the title by a ten-rounds unanimous decision win.\nFor her next bout after the Reynoso contest, Serrano lost some thirty pounds to compete in the Super-Flyweight division, where she faced Eva Voraberger of Austria for the WBO's vacant world title on Friday, January 18, 2019, at the Madison Square Garden in New York City. Serrano won the title by a first-round knockout. Serrano only took 35 seconds to win this bout.\nSerrano kept collecting titles (and retaining one of them) when she next boxed Heather Hardy on Friday, September 19, 2019, at the Madison Square Garden's Theater in New York City, retaining her WBO women's world Featherweight title and winning the WBC's interim one, by a ten-rounds unanimous decision victory, with two scores of 98-91 and one of 98-92, all for her.\nOn Thursday, March 21, 2021, Serrano defeated Argentina's Daniela Bermudez at the Plaza del Quinto Centenario in San Juan to retain her WBC and WBO women's world Featherweight titles and add the IBO's one, which was vacant, by a ninth-round knockout.\nOn Saturday, April 30, 2022, Serrano fought her biggest fight to date, when she faced Irish superstar Katie Taylor in a fight for the WBA, WBC, WBO and IBF world Lightweight titles, in what is considered one of the biggest fights in women's boxing history. Serrano lost the fight by a very close, ten-rounds split decision with scores of 93-97 and 94-96 against her and a 96-93 for her. The bout, held at the Madison Square Garden in New York City, was promoted by Eddie Hearn.\nAs of late 2023, Serrano had a record of 45 wins and 2 losses in 47 tests, with 30 wins by knockout and no losses that way.\nMelissa Hernandez, a boxer who has fought in places such as Australia, Canada and Panama, became the fourth Puerto Rican woman to win a world title when she defeated WBC women's world Featherweight champion Jelena Mrdjenovic by a ten-rounds unanimous decision on Friday, September 14, 2012, at the Shaw Conference Centre in Edmonton, Canada. Hernandez is from the western Puerto Rico city of Mayaguez. A former resident of New York City, she later resided in Miami Beach, Florida.\nCindy Serrano became the fifth Puerto Rican female world champion boxer, and, at the same time, half of the first pair of Puerto Rican sisters and second pair of Puerto Rican siblings to be world champions along with her sister Amanda. Cindy Serrano won the Universal Boxing Federation's world Junior Lightweight title when she beat Grecia Novas Mateo for the vacant belt on Friday, May 10, 2013, at the Carlos Cruz Coliseum in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, by a first-round knockout.\nAmateurs.\nVarious Puerto Ricans have won medals at different amateur boxing competitions, both for the island and for other countries. In 1948 at the 1948 Summer Olympic Games in London, England, boxer Juan Evangelista Venegas became the first ever Olympic medalist for Puerto Rico, winning a bronze medal in boxing. He won in the Bantamweight division.\nJosé Torres of Ponce fought for the United States in the 1956 Summer Olympics at Melbourne as a middleweight. He lost to László Papp of Hungary in the finals but secured a silver medal. Torres, who reportedly did not support the Puerto Rican statehood (with the United States) status, had nevertheless moved to the United States prior to those games and he was serving in the United States Army; therefore, he had to represent that country instead of Puerto Rico.\nIn 1976, the then-17-year-old Puerto Rican, Orlando Maldonado, secured a bronze medal at the Light-Flyweight boxing competition of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada, the second Puerto Rican Olympic medal, both, until then, bronzes in boxing. Maldonado went on to have a highly competitive professional boxing career, where he once challenged for a world title.\nIn 1978, Alberto Mercado of Cayey represented Puerto Rico at the 1978 Central American and Caribbean Games held at Colombia. He won gold at these games and participated in a world cup tournament. Hoping to become the first Puerto Rican ever to win a gold medal at an Olympic Games, Mercado moved to Cuba periodically; there he trained hard towards that goal.\nMercado, who, like Torres, did not like the idea of statehood for Puerto Rico, was one of only three American citizens to participate in the 1980 Olympics celebrated in Moscow, Soviet Union, bearing the flag of and competing in boxing for Puerto Rico after having won the gold medal at the 1979 Pan American Games. The other two were also representatives from Puerto Rico and boxers: Luis Pizarro and José Angel Molina. Competing as a flyweight, Mercado lost to future professional world champion Gilberto Roman of Mexico in the competition's round of 16. Mercado went on to have a very productive career as a professional boxer.\n1984 proved to be a historic year for Puerto Rican amateur boxing: at that year's summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, boxer Luis Ortiz, competing at the Lightweight division, became the first Puerto Rican ever to win a silver medal at an Olympic competition (Monica Puig, a tennis player, became the first Puerto Rican to win a gold medal, 32 years later) and his teammate Arístides González, who fought as a Middleweight, won a bronze medal, to also achieve the first time Puerto Rico won two medals at the same Olympic competition, a feat later repeated only by Javier Culson and Jaime Espinal during the competition 28 years later.\nAníbal Santiago Acevedo was also a highly-successful amateur boxer from Puerto Rico. In 1992, at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, he became the nation's only medalist by taking home a bronze medal. Acevedo boxed at Welterweight. He had also won a bronze medal at the 1991 Pan American Games in Havana, Cuba. Santiago Acevedo also attempted a professional boxing career, but he retired from that with a humble record.\nDaniel Santos was also a highly decorated amateur boxer. He won a bronze medal at the 1994 Goodwill Games in St. Petersburgh, Russia, a silver medal at the 1995 Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, Argentina, and another bronze medal, at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia, at Welterweight. As of 2023, Santos' bronze at the 1996 Olympics has been the last Olympic medal Puerto Rico has gained in boxing. Santos went on to become the first Olympic medalist from Puerto Rico to win a professional world boxing title.\nIn 2023, Ashleyann Lozada made history by becoming the first Puerto Rican woman to qualify for an Olympic Games women's boxing competition. She did so by securing a bronze medal at the 2023 Pan American Games in Santiago, Chile and will compete at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, France. Lozada, from San Juan, is a featherweight. She beat Canada's Marie-bathoul Al-Ahmadieh, by a 5-0 unanimous decision, to secure the only medal Puerto Rico garnered at boxing in the Chilean games.\nInternational Boxing Hall of Fame Members.\nThere are 13 Puerto Ricans in the International Boxing Hall of Fame, all of them men. Here is a list of Puerto Ricans who are in that hall of fame:"

        "title": "Major League Baseball on television in the 2020s",
        "text": "The following is a general overview of Major League Baseball on television in the 2020s. During the 2020s, Major League Baseball announced its first exclusive television contract with a paid streaming service (Peacock and AppleTV+). Due to the bankruptcy of Diamond Sports Group, MLB took over the production of the local broadcasts of the San Diego Padres and Arizona Diamondbacks.\nYear-by-year breakdown.\n2020.\nNational.\n2020 was the seventh year of eight-year deals with Fox, ESPN, and TBS. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Major League Baseball season was shortened to 60 games. Opening day was July 27. There was no All-Star game or Home Run Derby.\nAs part of the shortened season, Major League Baseball used an expanded Wild Card Series for the 2020 season. TBS televised one AL Wild Card Series, both American League Division Series matchups and the American League Championship Series. ESPN televised seven of the eight Wild Card Series with live look-ins and alternate broadcasts on ESPN+. On September 28, it was announced that ABC would broadcast at least four of ESPN's Wild Card Series games, marking the first time a national MLB game had aired on the network since 1995 (via the ill-fated \"The Baseball Network\" arrangement). FS1 and MLB Network will televise both National League Division Series matchups. Fox and FS1 televised the National League Championship Series, and the World Series was on Fox for the 21st straight year.\nLocal.\nThe Chicago White Sox and Chicago Cubs signed new broadcast deals that went into effect in the 2020 season. The White Sox moved all their locally controlled games to NBC Sports Chicago, while the Cubs moved all their locally controlled games to Marquee Sports Network.\nLong-time Cincinnati Reds television play-by-play announcer Thom Brennaman resigned on September 26 after he was caught using a homophobic slur in a game on August 19 against the Kansas City Royals. Sideline host Jim Day took over Brennaman's duties for the rest of the season, beginning August 20.\n2021.\nNational.\n2021 was the eighth and final year of the contracts with Fox, ESPN, and TBS before new seven-year deals began in 2022. FS1 televised games on Tuesday nights and Saturdays, both during the afternoon and evening. Fox also aired some Saturday night games, as part of Baseball Night in America. ESPN televised games on its flagship \"Sunday Night Baseball\" as well as Monday and Wednesday night games and holiday games on Memorial Day and Labor Day. ESPN Sunday Night Baseball telecasts were exclusive. TBS televised 13 straight weeks of Sunday afternoon games and also televised the National League postseason. The American League postseason was split between ESPN, Fox/FS1, and MLB Network (AL Wild Card on ESPN, the ALDS split between FS1 and MLB Network, and the ALCS on Fox and FS1). For the 22nd straight year, the 2021 World Series aired exclusively on Fox.\nA three-game series between the Philadelphia Phillies and the San Francisco Giants, whose regional television rights were both held by the NBC Sports Regional Networks, aired exclusively and nationally on NBC's streaming service Peacock. The first time that NBC Sports produced a nationally televised Major League Baseball game since the year 2000.\nABC televised a \"Sunday Night Baseball\" matchup between the Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Cubs on August 8. The broadcast marked ABC's first broadcast of \"Sunday Night Baseball\" and the first regular season game it has broadcast since its involvement in The Baseball Network in 1995. Former ABC broadcaster and 2021 Ford C. Frick Award winner Al Michaels appeared as a special guest.\nLocal.\nOn March 31, the eve of Opening Day, the Fox Sports Networks were rebranded as Bally Sports as part of an agreement between majority-owner Sinclair Broadcast Group and casino operator Bally's Corporation.\nAs part of its co-ownership of YES Network, Amazon Prime Video simulcasted 21 of the Yankees games carried on broadcast TV by WPIX for Amazon Prime subscribers in the New York Yankees' home market.\n2022.\nNational.\n2022 was the first season of new broadcast deals for Fox, ESPN and TBS that run through 2028. Fox remains the league's main broadcaster, carrying a package of regular season games on the main Fox broadcast network and FS1, and Spanish-language broadcasts on Fox Deportes. Fox aired primetime \"Baseball Night in America\" games primarily on Saturday nights, as well as the All-Star Game and MLB at Field of Dreams games. With the move of Joe Buck to ESPN and \"Monday Night Football\" over the NFL offseason, Joe Davis became the new lead play-by-play announcer for Fox's MLB coverage. ESPN networks carried 30 exclusive games per season, including 25 \"Sunday Night Baseball\" games, as well as an Opening Day primetime game, the Home Run Derby, and Spanish-language broadcasts on ESPN Deportes. ESPN dropped most of its weeknight game packages under its new contract, with only five non-Sunday games scheduled. As part of the new deal, ESPN has the option to carry selected games on ABC, and stream all of its games on ESPN+ (which, as before, carries a daily game from MLB.tv at no additional charge). TBS switched from late-season Sunday games to Tuesday-night games throughout the season. MLB Network will continue to broadcast various games throughout the season, including original \"MLB Network Showcase\" games, and simulcasts of games from local broadcasters.\nFor the postseason, ESPN networks held rights to the wild-card round; due to logistical concerns (especially with the fluctuating placements of teams in the standings during the final games of the regular season), the network employed remote production for the Padres/Mets and Mariners/Blue Jays series. The latter series employed a variant of the \"enhanced world feed\" model used in the 2020 season, with commentators and other selected staff on-site at Rogers Centre, but using video feeds from the Sportsnet production.\nFox Sports held rights to the National League Division Series, Championship Series, and the World Series for the 23rd consecutive season; while TBS held rights to the American League Division Series and Championship Series. Spanish-language broadcasts of all ALDS and ALCS games aired on MLB Network.\nMajor League Baseball also reached a deal with Apple Inc. to establish a new exclusive package known as \"Friday Night Baseball\" in the United States, Canada, and other international territories, which is produced by MLB Network and streams on Apple TV+ throughout the regular season. NBC Sports re-entered MLB broadcasting with \"MLB Sunday Leadoff,\" a new exclusive package of Sunday afternoon games streamed on Peacock. The contract will initially be for two years. The \"MLB Game of the Week Live on YouTube\" also returned with fifteen games during the season.\nIn Canada, Sportsnet—the main Canadian rightsholder of MLB, and regional broadcaster of the co-owned Toronto Blue Jays—gained the rights to produce local broadcasts of postseason games if the Blue Jays participate (as opposed to previous seasons, where it was required to simulcast the U.S. telecasts), featuring its main broadcast team of Buck Martinez and Pat Tabler (Sportsnet's alternate play-by-play announcer, Dan Shulman, had commitments to ESPN Radio's postseason coverage. This became moot for future seasons after Shulman announced that he would step down from ESPN Radio's coverage after the 2022 season to focus more on roles at Sportsnet).\nLocal.\nAmazon Prime Video exclusively streams 21 Yankees games in the Yankees home market (except for the final game in the package, which was simulcast on both Prime Video and YES Network due to Aaron Judge's home run record). These games formerly were allocated to WPIX (which retains a sub-licensed 28-game Mets package from SNY).\nOn June 1, 2022, NESN, the television home of the Boston Red Sox, launched NESN 360, an over-the-top subscription streaming platform that offers live streams of Red Sox games without a cable subscription.\nOn June 23, 2022, Bally Sports soft-launched Bally Sports+, an over-the-top subscription streaming platform that offers live streams and market-specific video-on-demand content from its regional networks. At that time, Bally was able to negotiate the streaming rights for only five of the MLB teams it holds local TV rights to Detroit, Kansas City, Miami, Milwaukee, and Tampa.\n2023.\nNational.\n2023 is the second year of the existing seven-year deals with ESPN, Fox, TBS, Apple TV+, and MLB Network; and the second year of a two-year deal with NBC Sports/Peacock:\nFox continued to air their \"Baseball Night in America\" slate of exclusive Saturday games. However, the slate began in May, with the return of Saturday afternoon games in April, and Thursday evening games in the latter part of the season where Saturday games would conflict with Fox's college football obligations. The network also aired the 2023 MLB All-Star Game. FS1 also broadcast non-exclusive games on Saturdays at times when no game is on the broadcast network, along with some irregularly scheduled weeknight games, mostly on Monday nights. Jason Benetti joined Fox as a play-by-play announcer. Derek Jeter joined Fox Sports as a studio analyst.\nDuring the postseason, the ESPN networks (including ABC) (with Spanish–language simulcasts on ESPN Deportes) will air all four Wild Card Series. TBS (with Spanish-language simulcasts on MLB Network) will then broadcast the National League Division Series and the National League Championship Series, and Fox Sports (Fox and FS1, with Spanish-language simulcasts on Fox Deportes) will broadcast the American League Division Series, the American League Championship Series and the World Series.\nApple TV+ continues to hold the rights to \"Friday Night Baseball\". Wayne Randazzo and Alex Faust will be the new primary play-by-play commentators, replacing Melanie Newman and Stephen Nelson. Dontrelle Willis and Ryan Spilborghs will be the new primary color commentators, replacing Katie Nolan, Hunter Pence, Hannah Keyser, and Chris Young. Randazzo will partner with Willis, while Faust will partner with Spilborghs. \nPeacock will continue to air 19 \"MLB Sunday Leadoff\" games on Sunday afternoons. Brendan Burke will be the primary play-by-play announcer with Matt Vasgersian and Chris Vosters filling in. One game will be simulcast on NBC.\nYouTube did not renew its deal for the \"MLB Game of the Week Live on YouTube\". YouTube TV also dropped MLB Network on February 1 in a carriage fee dispute.\nIn Canada, TVA Sports became the new national French-language broadcaster of the league under a three-season deal, carrying a package of 78 regular season games, the All-Star Game, and the postseason. TVA has historically also held French-language rights to the Toronto Blue Jays sub-licensed from Sportsnet, from which the network has sub-contracted some of its sports rights.\nLocal.\nIn December, St. Louis Cardinals play-by-play announcer Dan McLaughlin was released by Bally Sports after a DWI arrest. The Cardinals later announced that Atlanta Braves play-by-play announcer Chip Caray would take over the same role with the team. In February, Brandon Gaudin was announced as the new play-by-play announcer for the Atlanta Braves on Bally Sports South and Bally Sports Southeast, replacing Caray.\nOn February 15, 2023, Diamond Sports Group, owners of the Bally Sports regional sports networks, failed to make a $140M interest payment and entered a 30-day grace period. On March 14, Diamond Sports officially filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy.\nOn May 31, Diamond officially missed a second payment to the Padres, and the Padres' television rights were returned to Major League Baseball. Because Bally Sports San Diego, which aired Padres games, is a joint venture between the Padres and Diamond it is technically not in bankruptcy. Therefore this missed payment did not have the same bankruptcy protections that Diamond's other missed payments had.\nOn June 22, Diamond Sports Group announced its intention to reject its contract with the Diamondbacks on June 30. Diamond and the Arizona Diamondbacks later released a joint statement pushing back the hearing to July 17 and agreeing to continue Diamond's broadcast of Diamondbacks' games. On July 18, Diamond Sports officially rejected its contract with the DBacks. Like with the Padres, Major League Baseball took over production of the games, with the DBacks regular announcing team remaining in place.&lt;br&gt;\nOn February 24, 2023, the AT&amp;T SportsNet regional sports networks sent a letter to the Rockies, Astros, and Pirates saying they had until March 31, to reach an agreement to take their local television rights back. Warner Bros. Discovery, the owners of the networks, intends to leave the regional sports networks business. If a deal is not reached the networks will file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Root Sports Northwest is not affected because the Mariners already own majority control of that network. The Houston Astros and Houston Rockets negotiated throughout the season to take over AT&amp;T SportsNet Southwest from Warner Bros. Discovery. Ultimately, Warner Bros. Discovery and Major League Baseball negotiated a deal to keep the remaining RSNs operational through the end of the season.\nOn March 29, YES Network, the television home of the New York Yankees, launched an over-the-top subscription streaming platform that offers live streams of Yankees games without a cable subscription.\nOn May 22, NBC Sports California fired Oakland Athletics television play-by-play announcer Glen Kuiper. Kuiper's last broadcast was a May 5 game at the Kansas City Royals, during which he unintentionally uttered a racial slur while on the air. Vince Cotroneo and Johnny Doskow have since shared play-by-play duties on the television booth to replace Kuiper.\nOn July 25, Marquee Sports Network, the television home of the Chicago Cubs, launched an over-the-top subscription streaming platform that offers live streams of Cubs games without a cable subscription for $19.99 a month.\nOn September 29, the Houston Astros confirmed their acquisition of a 50% stake in Space City Home Network, the rebranded successor to AT&amp;T SportsNet Southwest, securing a place for their games to air in 2024.\nOn December 13, the Pittsburgh Pirates announced they had acquired a stake in SportsNet Pittsburgh, the rebranded successor to AT&amp;T SportsNet Pittsburgh, securing a place for their games to air in 2024.\nOn December 31, AT&amp;T SportsNet Rocky Mountain shut down, leaving the Colorado Rockies without a television broadcaster."

        "text": "The 1924–25 Massachusetts Agricultural Aggies men's ice hockey season was the 17th season of play for the program. The Aggies were coached by Lorin Ball in his first season.\nSeason.\nFor the third consecutive season, the ice hockey team had a new head coach. With the departure of Doc Gordon, the club needed a stable hand at the till and the freshman baseball coach, Lorin Ball agreed to take over. Essentially not having played the sport before, Ball had a steep learning curve and was forced to rely on the veteran players for guidance. Other than team captain John Crosby, only Sammy Gordon and Buddy Moberg had seen significant ice time previously and were largely responsible for designing the structure for the team. Warm weather forced the team onto a local pond for the opening game but the slow ice helped the Aggies to in the match. Williams was the faster of the two outfits and the poor conditions prevented them from using those strengths. Moberg's pair led MAC to victory and a positive outlook as the club headed into a busy schedule.\nAfter the auspicious start, MAC headed south to take on Yale and were completely outplayed by the defending intercollegiate champions. Yale stormed out of the gate and scored 7 goals in the first period. The Elis were able to relax after the torrid start and only scored 4 more for the remainder of the game. Near the end of the match, Crosby got the Aggies on the board but that did nothing to change the outcome. The team continued its road swing into New York two days later and faced Hamilton on its home rink. Just like Yale, the Continentals used an indoor, artificial rink and the pristine ice left the slower Aggies unable to cope. MAC played better than they had against the Bulldogs but the offense was still lacking and they were unable to solve the Hamilton netminder. The end of the trip came against Cornell the following afternoon and provided the closest match of the season. While the Aggies were tired out from having little rest, the irregular ice on Beebe Lake was more familiar to the players and they were able to get to their game more effectively. Cornell opened the scoring after a slow start from MAC but the team seemed to find its skating legs in the second. A second goal from the Big Red resulted from a comedy of errors but still left the Aggies down by 2. Moberg finally got his team on the board with a few minutes remaining and the team did what it could to find the tying marker but time ran out before they could get another.\nOnce the team returned home, they found that the warm weather, which had caused an earlier match with Amherst to be scrapped, had returned. The second match with the Lord Jeffs was postponed for a week while the succeeding game against Bates was pushed until a week later. Without any ice to practice on, the time off wasn't of any particular help for the team, however, neither they nor Amherst were prepared to play a game in a blizzard. In severe conditions that saw the ice covered in snow despite the efforts of the freshman team to keep it clean, MAC played probably the most unique game in its history. The opening goal came as a result of Amherst sending the puck through a hole in the net and out in front of the cage before a second player shot it back into the cage. Moberg responded with a 0-angle shot that hit a Sabrina defender in the arm and deflected into the goal. the Jeffs scored two conventional goals in the second and while Potter was able to cut into the lead in the third, none of the Maroon players could get the tying goal. While the wind was just as blustery in the match with Bates, the snow was mercifully absent. Moberg and Crosby combined to give the team a 3-goal lead early in the game. Entering the third everything pointed to a win for the Aggies, however, the Bobcats roared back to the game and force overtime. Two 10-minute overtime periods passed without effect but Taylor finally managed to break the tie in the third. Moberg finished off his hat-trick in the waning moments to cap off the much-needed win.\nThe day after the games with Bates, MAC headed up to take on Dartmouth. The game was eerily reminiscent of the Yale game when the Greens got off to a flying start. When the dust settled, the Aggies were down 0–7 and the game was effectively over. The Indians used several substitutes afterwards and, though they scored a further 7 goals, the Aggies were able to get 2 goals against the reserves. MAC was hoping it could wash the taste of the embarrassing loss out in one of their final two games. Unfortunately, the weather grew warmer and both matches ended up being cancelled.\nGeorge Hanscomb served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 2023–24 Robert Morris Colonials men's ice hockey season was the 18th season of play for the program and the 12th in Atlantic Hockey. The Colonials represented Robert Morris University, played their home games at the Clearview Arena and were coached by Derek Schooley in his 18th season.\nSeason.\nWith the team returning to the ice for the first time in over two years, the team accomplished its primary objective for the year simply by existing. There were few, if any, expectations for the team that still had to learn how to work together. Predictably, both the offense and defense were weak but neither were embarrassingly so; the Colonials averaged more than 2 goals per game despite suffering through a terrible stretch in the middle of the season. The team's porous defense surrendered an average of almost 40 shots per game and Robert Morris was routinely outshot throughout the season. While starter Chad Veltri faced an daunting task in most games, he did give the Colonials a chance to win on most nights. The Niagara transfer stopped well more than 90% of the shots he faced and led the nation in saves per game.\nAs the season progressed, Robert Morris was consistently ranked among the worst teams, but that didn't stop the Colonials from producing a few highlights. The shutout of Bowling Green in just their second game back was a welcome relief for the fans who hadn't seen the program win since 2021. While their road trip to Minneapolis resulted in two losses, RMU's defense stood strong against the highly-ranked Minnesota Golden Gophers. The best moment of the year, however, was probably the team's first playoff game. The RMU power play scored twice to give the team a 2-goal lead over Bentley entering the third period. While Robert Morris was unable to hold the lead, they still had a chance to win in overtime. Just before the end of the extra session, Cameron Garvey intercepted a pass behind the Falcons' cage and wrapped the puck around to score the winning goal. The team was unable to parlay their upset victory into any further success, but that did not detract from their successful return.\nOff of the ice, the team had two very positive developments over the course of the year. The first was a deal struck with SportsNet Pittsburgh to broadcast select games for both the men's and women's teams. Not only would this increase the visibility of the program, but the additional funds would help to stability the program. Towards the end of the season, the university announced plans for a new $28 million arena and were seeking to have some of the cost offset by the state. While estimates put the completion for the project approximately three years away, the plans themselves demonstrated that the school was now expecting to keep its ice hockey team around for the foreseeable future.\nRecruiting.\nDue to the team being dormant for two years, the vast majority of the roster is made up of players new to the program. The Colonials have only three returning players: Gavin Gulash, Cameron Hebert and Matt Hutton\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

Led by 7th-year head coach Bill Henderson, the team played their home games at Marrs McLean Gymnasium in Waco, Texas.\nAfter a February 3 loss to Texas A&amp;M, the Bears were 8–11 overall and 3–4 in SWC games. They ran off five consecutive wins to close the regular season and tie for the conference title with an 8–4 record. Due to a season sweep of Arkansas, Baylor was selected to play in the 8-team NCAA tournament. The Bears defeated BYU before losing to the No.1 ranked, eventual National champion Bradley Braves. Baylor would travel to New York City for the National consolation game, where they were defeated by No. 5 NC State to close the season with a 14–13 record.\nThis season marked the second Final Four for the Bears in three seasons (1948).

        "text": "The 1926–27 YMCA College Maroons men's ice hockey season was the 20th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAfter being dormant for two years, the ice hockey program at YMCA College was revived. The primary factor in this was securing an arrangement with the operators of the Eastern States Coliseum to allow the team access to consistent ice for the first time in its history. Within a month of the program's return, the Maroons were invited to join a new circuit of teams called the New England Intercollegiate Hockey League that was arranged by schools like Boston College and Boston University. The plan was to use the stable rinks in Springfield, Boston and Providence for league games to help provide a consistent amount of games for the individual programs.\nPractice began in early December, however, as the team did not yet had a head coach, two plyers from the local professional team agreed to conduct the training in the interim. Unfortunately, those players were soon busy with other duties and a series of different men were in charge of the Springfield training. Unsurprisingly, the team did not demonstrate a great deal of teamwork in their first game. However, the offense was still able to produce and scored 4 goals in their return loss. By the following week the team was showing signs of improvement, however, they faced a much tougher challenge in Williams. The Maroons were outplayed through the entire match and could hardly get any offense going.\nFrank Carroll was brought in ahead of the third game for the Maroons and the team responded well to his steadying force, particularly on the back end. The defense was much more effective against Amherst than it had been in either of its first two games and led YMCA to its first win in over three years. The team then took an extended rest during the exam period and returned with a rematch against Providence. Almost as if to prove how far the Maroons had come under Carroll, the team equaled its 4-goal output but limited the Friars to just a single goal. YMCA took an overnight train north and faced New Hampshire the following day. The Maroons fell but had a chance to get revenge 4 days later at home. However, the result didn't change and YMCA was guaranteed to finish with a losing record after its 4th loss.\nThe final match of the year came on the road against Rensselaer and saw the team put forth their best effort of the season. The defense was stifling and allowed just 5 shots to find their way to Lang, who stopped each attempt. Johnson and Wilson scored to give the team the win and set them up well for the following season.\nKenneth Crump served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 2023–24 Arizona State Sun Devils men's ice hockey season was the 9th season of play for the program at the Division I level. The Sun Devils represented Arizona State University and were coached by Greg Powers in his 12th season.\nSeason.\nArizona State came into its final season as an independent program looking for one final hurrah before it joined the National Collegiate Hockey Conference. The Sun Devils got off on the right foot by winning their first four games of the season and rising up into the national rankings. The team suffered a bit of a setback when they couldn't overcome Miami and then escaped utter disaster when they needed overtime to defeat Stonehill, the worst team in the nation.\nThe team recovered with a pair of split series against top-10 teams in November and looked to be well-positioned for a potential NCAA tournament berth. The defense was holding up well enough and the Sun Devils were getting decent goaltending performances from T. J. Semptimphelter. The offense, however, was the star of the show; Lukas Sillinger led the way up front, setting a new program record with 48 points while Matthew Kopperud was lights-out on the power play, scoring 17 of his 23 goals on the man-advantage (the 4th-most in NCAA history).\nAfter a decent stretch in December, Arizona State kicked off the second half of its season by winning a pair of in-season tournaments. First up was the inaugural Adirondack Winter Invitational that finished with a shootout win over #17 Cornell. The following week, at its own Desert Hockey Classic, the Sun Devils took down Omaha in overtime to win the tournament for the first time. The wins lifted ASU up to #11 in the polls but the team was lagging behind in the PairWise. While their record was enviable at 16–3–5, the team's ranking was downgraded for two reasons: strength of schedule and margin of victory. Arizona State had played several ranked teams by the mid-way point of the season, however, those games were off-set by several series against bottom-dwelling clubs. To make matters worse, ASU's narrow wins over Stonehill and the loss to Miami kept the team from rising any higher than 16th in the PairWise.\nDue to the way conference schedules typically work out, ASU would have little opportunity in the later portion of the season to climb higher in the rankings and they needed a strong performance against Cornell to stake their claim. Unfortunately, the Sun Devils had one of their worst offensive performances of the season and were limited to just 37 shots over the weekend. The Big Red avenged their Winter Invitational loss with a sweep of Arizona State and pushed the Sun Devils outside the playoff picture. To have any real chance of making the tournament, ASU needed to go undefeated down the stretch. However, the team lost its third consecutive game when Augustana arrived and their dwindling hopes faded even further. The loss also caused a change in ASU's goal crease; Semptimphelter had been playing well for most of the season but he would have poor outing from time to time. The Augustana match saw him surrender 3 goals on 6 shots and, to make matters worse, it took the Vikings more than half the game to reach that total. Gibson Homer was inserted into the cage and, while he was unable to secure a victory, he became the starter for the latter portion of the year.\nAt the close of the season, Arizona State had set new programs records for wins and winning percentage. They had defeated four teams that finished the year with a national ranking and had one of the top offenses in the country. Unfortunately, their habit of playing down to the opponents level doomed the team's chances at a playoff appearance.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

The season began in April in Brighton, England, and ended in October in Brighton, England.\nSummary of season.\nPrior to the creation of the International Lawn Tennis Federation and the establishment of its world championship events in 1913 the Wimbledon Championships, the U.S. National Championships, the Irish Lawn Tennis Championships and the Northern Championships were considered by players and historians as the four most important tennis tournaments to win.\n1882 sees a substantial increase in women's events as the tennis circuit continues to form. In May 1882 at the first major event of the year the Irish Championships in Dublin a full programme of women's singles and doubles were held, as well as a mixed doubles event. In the women's singles competition Ireland's Mary Abercrombie defeated England's Marian Bradley. In terms of draw size the East Gloucestershire Championships had the largest singles competition attracting 17 players. The West of England Championships and Northern Championships both had the largest doubles draws at 11 pairs a piece. Whilst the West of England Championships featured the largest mix doubles draw of any event at 32 players.\nIn June 1882 at the second major tournament of the year the Northern Championships the organisers staged a ladies singles championship for the first time won by Ireland's May Langrishe who defeated England's Miss Langley in straight sets. At the 1882 Wimbledon Championships the world's first major tennis tournament, it still remained an all men's event with no women's competitions being held. In North America at the U.S. National Championships there was still no women's championship events held. In 1913 the International Lawn Tennis Federation was created, that consisted of national member associations. The ILTF through its associated members then became responsible for supervising women's tour events.\nSeason results.\nNotes 1: Challenge Round: the final round of a tournament, in which the winner of a single-elimination phase faces the previous year's champion, who plays only that one match. The challenge round was used in the early history of tennis (from 1877 through 1921), in some tournaments not all.* Indicates challenger\nKey\nSingles.\n\"Notes:The Irish Championships and East Gloucestershire Championships used both grass and hard asphalt courts for matches\"."

        "text": "The Basketball Tournament 2023 was the tenth edition of The Basketball Tournament (TBT), a 5-on-5, single elimination basketball tournament with a $1 million winner-take-all prize. The tournament, involving 64 teams, began on July 19 and ended on August 3 with the championship game in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The tournament format was similar to that of the last edition in 2022—64 teams, each playing in one of eight regionals. \nThe event had a \"championship week\", starting with the regional winners advancing to quarterfinals at one of four sites, Dayton, Louisville, Wheeling, WV, and Wichita. The quarterfinal winners then traveled to Philadelphia for the semifinals and championship game. Heartfire, a team sponsored by MedImpact, won the tournament.\nFormat.\nFor its 2023 edition, TBT retained its traditional 64-team format and eight-region format, with each regional involving eight teams at a single host site (similar in format to the NCAA Division II men's and women's tournaments). Wichita is serving as host for two separate regionals.\nIn a feature it calls \"Run It Back\", TBT organizers invited all teams that won first-round games in the 2022 edition to play in 2023. The remaining teams, and the regional placements for all entrants, were revealed in a selection special hosted by Andrew Zoldan with analyst Seth Greenberg that aired on TBT's YouTube channel on June 21, 2023.\nAs with previous years, all tournament games operate with the \"Elam Ending\", a format of ending the game without use of a game clock. Under the Elam Ending, the clock is turned off at the first dead-ball whistle with 4 minutes or less to play in the game. At that time, a target score, equal to the score of the leading team (or tied teams) plus eight, is set, and the first team to reach this target score is declared the winner of the game. Thus, all games end on a made basket (field goal or free throw) and there is no overtime.\nVenues.\nThe Basketball Tournament 2023 featured games in eight locations, seven of which hosted a regional. The eighth hosted the championship weekend (two semifinal contests and the championship game). Official regional names, if different from the location names, are indicated in the listings below the location names.\nTeams.\nSource:\nTBT has a history of teams rostered primarily with alumni from specific NCAA Division I college basketball programs; 33 such teams entered the 2023 tournament. Three other teams were rostered primarily with alumni from groups of NCAA basketball programs sharing a common bond. Two mostly consist of alumni from a specific Division I conference, one is drawn from a group of historic basketball rivals, another is drawn from NCAA Division III alumni, and the last is drawn from historically black colleges and universities.\n\"Note: team names are per the TBT bracket; some names have slight variation on TBT website pages.\"\nTournament bracket.\nSeven of the eight no. 1 seeds advanced in first-round play, with no. 8 India Rising upsetting Red Scare in the Dayton Regional.\nFive no. 1 seeds advanced in second-round play; the lowest seed to advance to the third round was no 6. Nasti Nati from the Dayton Regional.\nTwo no. 1 seeds advanced in third-round play; the lowest seed to advance to the quarterfinals was again Nasti Nati.\nNo no. 1 seeds won a quarterfinal match; the lowest seed to advance to the semifinals was no 4. Herd That from the West Virginia Regional.\nIn the first semifinal game, Herd That were eliminated by Heartfire, the no. 2 seed from the Wichita 1 Regional.\nIn the second semifinal game, Friday Beers were eliminated by Bleed Green, the no. 2 seed from the Lubbock Regional.\nHeartfire then defeated Bleed Green in the championship game.\nSource:\nChampionship Week.\nQuarterfinals games were played at Wichita, West Virginia, Dayton, and Louisville. All semifinal and championship games were played in Philadelphia.\nEric Collins, Fran Fraschilla, and Ashley ShaAhmadi were the announcers for both semifinal matches and the championship game.\nAwards.\nSource: "

        "text": "The 1925–26 Vermont men's ice hockey season was the inaugural season of play for the program. The team was coached by E. L. Desautels in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nWhile Students at Vermont had been allowed to put a team together in 1924, it was only on an informal basis. The team was shuttered the following year due to a lack of funding but, thanks to pressure exerted by the '24 players, school President Bailey allocated a large sum of money for the team's return and the first official season for the program. The team managed to get access to Kirby's Rink in nearby Winooski and use the venue for its home rink. While the building gave the team a stable home, it did prevent many students from attending the games during the year due to its distance from campus.\nThe first match was held against a local semi-pro outfit and saw the team post its first win with Herbert scoring the first two goals in program history. Vermont then played Middlebury and Herbert against staked the team to a 2-goal lead. Unfortunately, the Panthers then staged a dramatic comeback and scored three unanswered to hand the Green and Gold their first defeat. The next game came against Union and turned out to be an exciting contest. The Dutchmen got an early lead but Vermont charged back in the second period. Herbert recorded his third consecutive 2-goal game and was joined by Wood in the third to tie the match at 3-all. Early in the first overtime, Wood notched his second marker to give the Greens a lead but Union quickly responded to tie the game once more. The second overtime saw Union gain the edge but Vermont was unable to respond.\nThe return game with Middlebury did not go as planned and the team was shutout for the first time. The defensive effort from Denning and Winchenbach was solid but the constant attack from the Panthers eventually worse down Vermont. The Greens then took out their frustrations on Saint Michael's and buried the purple team 12–0. Herbert set a program record with 8 goals in the game with Wood and Fitch each adding a pair. The game was so out of hand that coach Desautels was able to use 6 reserve players in the match in order to give them some game experience.\nChester B. Russell served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The IBU was responsible for the overseeing of the game in Ireland but would \"cooperate with the English Baseball Association\" and members of the English body were in attendance, at Queens Park, Dublin, for an exhibition game in April 1933. In June 1933 the Irish Baseball Union selected a team to travel to Liverpool for the first ever international between England and Ireland, the team included players from St. Mary's, St. Oswald's, British and Irish, Hibernians, Independent and Connaught ball clubs. England overpowered the Irish team and won by an innings and 42 runs.\nFirst international roster.\nThe below table details the names, baseball clubs and positions of the Irish roster, chosen to play against England, in their first international, in 1933."

        "text": "The 1920–21 Princeton Tigers men's ice hockey season was the 21st season of play for the program. The Tigers were coached Russell O. Ellis in his first season.\nSeason.\nPrinceton's season got underway in early December with the first meeting of prospective players. The inexperienced players were set to go down to the Philadelphia Ice Palace for on-ice training. Eight players were returning for the Tigers, however, with how bad the team had performed in '20 that was not necessarily a positive. After the first on-ice drills were held, Gus Hornfeck, who had coached the team before the war, agreed to return and take over the squad after Christmas. At the same time, the team came to an agreement with the operators of the ice palace to use the venue as their home rink for the season. While this did afford the team access to good ice, it also meant that the Tigers were only able to schedule 8 games due to high demand for the arena. In order to bolster their schedule, the Tigers set up a trip to Buffalo during the winter break where they would play several Canadian teams.\nJust before the team was to leave for Buffalo, they received news that warm weather had caused all of the available rinks to become unusable. Instead, the team headed to the Ice Palace and got in several days of practice that they hoped would set them up well for the rest of the schedule. In the run up to the first game, Hornfeck was absent. This left the team to be run by Eugene Maxwell. While the players did a good job preparing themselves for the match, they were unable to properly account for the strange nature of Fordham's rink. Not only was the 181st Street Ice Palace much smaller than they were used to, but it had 4 pillar set into the ice that had to be avoided during the match. The obstacles caused the team quite a bit of trouble but the Tigers were able to keep pace with the Rams regardless. Princeton kept the game close and had a chance to tie the match late but ran out of time. After the game, the team announced that Russell Ellis of the St. Nicholas Hockey Club had been engaged to take over as coach. A few days later the second game was played against the Quaker City Hockey Club, a semi-pro outfit from Philadelphia. The team looked better than they had against Fordham but their opponents were more experienced and easily able to sink the Tigers. Despite using many alternates in the match, Princeton was unable to keep up with the pros.\nThe early baptism by fire helped turn the team into a formidable unit and the results were on full display by the end of the week when Princeton dominated Penn to earn its first win of the season. Keyes, who had been moved up to staring wing for the game, led the way with a hat-trick while Haight and Knox were also very visible in the game. A week later the team opened their conference slate by taking on Yale. Several good practices, including a few held on Lake Carnegie, had the team well prepared for the Elis and Princeton got off to a quick start. In front of a boisterous crowd, Haight kicked off the scoring and then doubled the Princeton lead in the second. Yale responded with goals in each of the final two periods and forced the match into overtime. Knox scored almost immediately after the puck was dropped and then added a second before a minute had elapsed. After this, the team played defense for the remainder of the 5-minute session and skated away with a victory.\nEntering the game with Harvard, the team had to change tactics. Since the Crimson stubbornly continued to play 7-man hockey, the Tigers had to promote one of their reserves to starter so that the rover position could be filled. Even without those changes, the Tigers were facing a daunting challenge as Harvard was the top team in the country and already well on its was to winning another intercollegiate championship. In front of some 7,500 Boston fans, Princeton got off to a good start but couldn't get the puck behind the Crimson netminder. As the pace picked up, Harvard began to distance themselves from the Tigers and in short order the game became a runaway. When the dust settled Princeton was on the wrong end of a 0–7 score and had no margin for error if it wanted a chance at a league title.\nDuring the exam break, the team spent a few days practicing on the St. Paul's School rink. The extended layoff had the Tigers on the shelf until mid-February but, once they returned for the rematch with Yale, the didn't seem to be any drop in production. Wonham started the game with his first goal of the season and from then on the match was tilted in Princeton's favor. Yale's defense stiffened in the second but they could get nothing through the Tiger defense. Princeton on the whole looked like the best version of itself and made the onlooking Boston crowd nervous for the rematch with Harvard. The game was the first match on the year for Cook, who had been academically ineligible to start the year, and he took over the starting spot from Ehret, who was out with an injury.\nEntering the rematch with Penn, the team was still without Ehret but then lost Keyes to injury as well. Corcoran was slotted in at win but the absence of the two starting wingers hampered the Tiger attack. Princeton was only able to score twice against the Quakers but the defense played one of its best games all season and didn't give an inch. Hight and Wonham were nigh impenetrable in the match and allowed the offence the time it needed to get up to speed. Cook and Merritt scored in the third and secured the victory for the Tigers.\nEntering the game with Dartmouth, the team was shorthanded by injury. During a practice game with Bryn Athyn Academy, Wonham was felled and would be out for the rest of the year to recover. Corcoran, too, was out after having developed a knee effusion following the game with Penn. While Keyes was still sidelined, Ehret was set to return, though his effectiveness was unknown. On game day, Ehret suddenly reported a resurgence of pain and was forced to beg off. Maxwell, who had been planning to play, came down with case of grippe and left the team with just 2 regulars in the lineup (Knox and Haight). Maxwell played through his illness and the team fought hard to stay in the game. After scoreless first the two traded goals in the second. The third, however, saw Dartmouth take over and score three unanswered goals to take the game.\nA rematch with Harvard had been slated to take place in March, however, the Crimson decided against venturing south and allowed the single game between the two to stand for the season series.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "Cobbs Creek Golf Course, established in 1916, is a 340-acre public, city-owned golf course in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was one of the first courses in the area to welcome golfers of all races, ethnicities, and genders.\nThe course consists of the 'Olde Course' and the adjoining Karakung Course which was added in 1929. \nHistory.\nCobbs Creek Golf Course was designed by Hugh Wilson with contributions from A. W. Tillinghast, George C. Thomas Jr., William Flynn, George Crump, and William Fownes. Wilson also designed nearby Merion Golf Club's east course.\nCharlie Sifford, the first Black golfer to play in a PGA tour event, learned to play at the course.\nThe course hosted the United States Public Links championship (1928), the United Golfers Association Championship for Black golfers, and two PGA tour events (1950s).\nIn the 1950s and 60s, part of the course was used by the military as an anti-aircraft battery. \nThe course is situated between Philadelphia's Overbrook and Overbrook Park neighborhoods.\nRestoration.\nThe course's clubhouse was destroyed by a fire in 2016. In 2019, the city's lease with the operating contractor expired and the course closed. The Cobbs Creek Foundation was formed soon after and was granted a 70-year lease. \nThe foundation is facilitating a $100 million renovation of the course which will restore the 18-hole ‘Olde Course’ and revive its adjoining facility, Karakung Golf Course, into a nine-hole course. Jim Wagner of Gil Hanse and Hanse Golf Design is leading the design team.\nTiger Woods, through the TGR Foundation, provided funding for an on-site TGR learning lab.\nThere was community push back and controversy surrounding the environmental impact of the restoration from several local organizations. Specifically, clear cutting trees without notice or approval, damaging habitats, reducing biodiversity, and contributing to soil erosion and flooding. The course was eventually granted an exemption from legal minimum anti-erosion standards.\nAwards.\nThe course was inducted into the National Black Golf Hall of Fame in 2021."

The small popularity of the sport lead to the formation of the Swaziland Badminton Association (later the Eswatini Badminton Association) in the late 1990s.\nEswatini juniors made their first international appearance in badminton when the national association sent their first few players to compete in the 2007 African Junior Badminton Championships in Gaborone, Botswana. The team finished in 7th after being eliminated in the group stages. \nAs of 2022, the national team has been inactive and have not competed in any tournaments since 2007."

In the semi-finals, Antonio Watson ran his personal best of 44.13 to lead the field and pulling veteran Vernon Norwood to his personal best of 44.26 in the first semi. This relegated World Record holder, making a heroic return from what should have been a career ending injury, Wayde van Niekerk to have to wait in the holding room to await his fate. In the second semi, Matthew Hudson-Smith led 2011 champion Kirani James In the third semi-final both 2022 Olympic champion Steven Gardiner and Olympic medalist Bayapo Ndori pulled up mid-race with hamstring injuries, opening the door for Quincy Hall. van Niekerk's time qualified him for the final, but he was relegated to the inside lane 2.\nFrom the gun in the final, Hudson-Smith was out fastest, making up the stagger on Hall to his outside at the end of the first turn. Inside of him, James was also gaining relative to the staggers. Van Niekerk pushed down the backstretch to try to regain contact with James. As they went into the final turn, Norwood began to move forward. Later in the turn, Watson started to move. As they hit the home stretch, Hudson-Smith had a metre and a half on James with Norwood and Watson about even on the outside another metre back, with van Niekerk about the same distance back on the inside. Still further back, Hall started to accelerate. Watson began to separate from Norwood and van Niekerk with Hall overstriding to try to catch them. 40 metres out, Watson caught James who could offer no more resistance. Norwood got past James and looked like he was closing on a slowing Hudson-Smith. Watson passed Hudson-Smith about 25 metres out and was on to victory. Norwood couldn't quite catch Hudson-Smith but a speeding Hall caught Norwood on the last step for bronze.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 45.00.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+2), was as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first 3 athletes in each heat (Q) and the next 6 fastest (q) qualify for the semi-finals.\nSemi-finals.\nThe first 2 athletes in each heat (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) qualify for the final.\nFinal.\nThe final started at 21:35 on 24 August.

His second place automatic qualifier of 1:44.49 was the slowest time to make the final thing returning bronze medalist Marco Arop. Ben Pattison was the slowest time qualifier with 1:44.23. Emmanuel Wanyonyi was the leading qualifier with 1:43.83.\nThe final started with Pattison the first to the break line, but Wanyonyi pushed the back stretch to take the lead before the next turn, but Wanyonyi used his position to keep the pace slow taking the bell at 52.68. Last year, Arop hit the bell in 52.05 and relinquished the lead on the home stretch. This year he was dead last. Halfway through the penultimate turn, Arop moved out to get some running room. Shifting gears as he hit the backstretch, Arop ran past the field, taking the lead at the beginning of the final turn and he kept going opening up a 2 metre lead through the turn. Coming off the turn, the others lines up three abreast behind Wanyonyi to sprint for home, but Arop was way out front and pulling away. Wanyonyi made a late run, pulling back a metre from Arop's lead, but still finished 2 metres back. Two more metres back, Pattison hit the line barely ahead of Adrián Ben and Slimane Moula for bronze.

Wightman and his coach had theorised that the Diamond League season with its ubiquitous pacemakers had given Ingebrigtsen a false sense of invulnerability that would tell if he chose to front run. Events had seemed to prove the truth of the theory. In discovering a template to defeat the Olympic prodigy, the question was had Wightman found the weakness in Ingebrigtsen, or simply given the Norwegian a lesson he would use to reassert his primacy.\nThe reigning champion was ruled out by injury, and Ingebrigtsen sought to neutralise the kick of anyone considering repeating the tactic of the Scot, taking to the front early and winding up the pace. But in a remarkable turn of events, Josh Kerr from Great Britain, Scotland and Edinburgh Athletics Club - who had been a friend and club team mate of Wightman since his early teens - displayed staggering self-confidence as he ignored the perils of following the hard pace, moved to the Olympic champion's shoulder, and executed once more the Wightman solution, surging past the favorite in the last 200 metres. Ingebrigtsen, the anticipated frontrunner, settled for the silver medal for a second successive year behind a Great Britain jersey, while his fellow countryman Narve Gilje Nordås claimed the bronze.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 3:34.20.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC +2), was as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nFirst 6 of each heat (Q) qualify to the semi-finals.\nSemi-finals.\nFirst 6 of each semi-final (Q) qualify to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started on 23 August at 21:16."

Norwegian Jakob Ingebrigtsen won the gold medal, followed by Mohamed Katir and Jacob Krop. \nSummary.\nThere was a little drama in the opening heats. World record holder Joshua Cheptegei did not run. In the first heat, Sam Parsons tripped. As he went down, Stewie McSweyn tripped over him and was taken out of contention. Referees awarded McSweyn a place in the final.\nSeventeen athletes toed the line. After sorting things out for two laps at 68 seconds per lap pace, Ishmael Rokitto Kipkurui threw in a 62 and nobody went with him. They let him have his day in the sun for 4 laps, then the peloton reeled him in. A leading pack mostly led by Berihu Aregawi then picked up the pace, 65, 62, 63, but the pack stayed as a group, very few were dropping off the pace. Three laps to go, it was time to race. While the Ethiopians Aregawi and Hagos Gebrhiwet were driving the pace, Luis Grijalva, Mohamed Ismail and Jimmy Gressier were always lurking on the front of the pack, defending champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen and Mohamed Katir, both of whom had competed in the 1500, were towards the back. Both felt they had something to prove. Ingebrigtsen was upset he had only won a silver medal in the 1500, losing gold to a Scottsman, this time Josh Kerr, for the second championships in a row. Katir, a bronze medalist from 2022, was upset he did not even make the 1500 final. With 3 laps to go Katir, followed by Ingebrigtsen, drifted towards the front. This move also brought the attention of Jacob Krop, Yomif Kejelcha and Mohammed Ahmed. The next 62 second lap strung out the back of the pack while there was a crowd near the front. The next lap at 58 pace congealed to 9. Coming in to the bell, there was a scramble. Seeing an opening one the inside as Aregawi drifted out, Gressier tried to sneak by on the inside. Aregawi closed the door and Gressier drifted back. Gebrhiwet, riding Aregawi's shoulder, was the reason he drifted out in the first place. When one door closed, it opened another for Gebrhiwet who pounced into the lead at the bell. Through the turn, Katir followed Gebrhiwet. Onto the backstretch, Katir used his 1500 speed to move to the lead, opening up 2 metres. Behind him, Ingebrigtsen had been boxed to the inside by Kejelcha. Ingebrigtsen had to drift out to lane 3 with Kejelcha still to his outside. Then he had to outrun Aregawi to get running room. Through the final turn Ingebrigtsen got around Gebrhiwet, the last of the three Ethiopians, spending considerable effort. Coming off the turn, he looked back to see if they were still mounting a challenge, no problem there, then he took off after Katir quickly getting to within a metre. But Ingebrigtsen was not making any more progress. Halfway down the straightaway it was as if he thought to himself, \"I could just run in to get a Silver medal. No, I'm here to get Gold.\" He made one more push, slowly getting past Katir. Having given all he could to the effort, he even leaned for the line to make sure. It was not easy, but Ingebrigtsen had defended the title. 10 metres in back of the duo, the rest of the large pack were still battling the three Ethiopians. Six runners, four lanes wide halfway down the home stretch, Grijalva, Ahmed and Krop were racing for bronze. Sprinting down lane 3, from seventh place with 200 to go, Krop emerged in front to take the third medal.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 13:07.00.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+2), is as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first 8 athletes in each heat (Q) qualified for the final.

The rest of the field had no interest in running that fast this early. After that burst, Ayeko backed off to a more sensible 71 second pace. The peloton let Ayeko have his time on television for the first 3200 metres before Benard Kibet pulled him in. Ayeko kept the point position for another 800 metres before Kibet decided it was time to swallow him up, dropping the pace to 66 seconds. After at little more than a lap, Ayeko dropped out. Kibet and Berihu Aregawi kept the pace going. On the 16th lap, Olympic Champion Selemon Barega came from the back of the lead group to show his teammate Aregawi how fast he wanted the pace. Aregawi obliged and held the point. As the laps counted down, defending champion Joshua Cheptegei was watching from Aregawi's shoulder, Mohammed Ahmed pinned on the rail, with all three Kenyans and Barega watching on the back. With a lap and a half to go, Barega floated up to join his teammate but that just brought Cheptegei to the front to take the bell first. The pack strung out, with only the two Ethiopians and Daniel Ebenyo able to stay in contact, Ahmed struggling to stay in tow. With 200 to go, Aregawi showed his weakness and looked back, Ebenyo went around him. Barega stuck to Cheptegei all the way through the final turn, Cheptegei covering his last 400 metres in 52.77 and still hadn't broken Barega. Cheptegei looked back then pushed one more time, finally Barega couldn't keep up, Cheptegei separated for a clear 8 metre victory. Defeated, Barega continued on to the finish line, but Ebenyo didn't stop racing. Barega let up 5 metres before the finish line only to have Ebenyo cruise by on the inside for silver.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 27:10.00.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (CEST), was as follows:\nResults.\nFinal.\nThe final was started at 18:26."

Over the next four hurdles, he opened a full metre on Daniel Roberts who had separated into a clear second. As Freddie Crittenden was edging into a clear third place, an American sweep looked to be developing. At the Olympics, Hansle Parchment closed fast as Holloway slowed over the final five hurdles. Here, Parchment was next to last over the fifth hurdle but he was just getting up his head of steam. By the ninth hurdle, Parchment was past Crittenden, then he pulled even with Roberts over the tenth. Holloway didn't slow down enough for a clear victory. Roberts and Parchment battled to the line with Parchment getting the knod for silver. After the race, Holloway walked around the stadium showing 3 fingers to indicate this was three times in a row.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 13.28 seconds.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+2), is as follows:\nResults.\nRound 1 (heats).\nRound 1 took place on 20 August, with the 45 athletes involved being split into 5 heats of 9 athletes each.

With three time silver medalist #2 Rai Benjamin and defending champion #3 Alison dos Santos, the top three of all time were there. And don't forget #8 Kyron McMaster. During the semi-finals, 18 year old Roshawn Clarke got inspired trying to chase Warholm, and the result was a new World Junior Record, now called a U20 Record, and #13 of all time. Trevor Bassitt moved to #18 all time with his performance in the semis just to be a time qualifier behind Warholm and Clarke.\nWarholm was assigned his favorite lane 7. Outside of him was McMaster in 8 and dos Santos in 9. With Benjamin in 6 and Clarke in 5, all the major players were on the outside of the track. As expected, Warholm took it out hard. Unexpectedly, Benjamin also took it out hard, marginally ahead of Warholm, and McMaster was right there with them. The three were virtually even at the halfway point, and then Warholm started to edge ahead. Down the home stretch, unlike previous meetings, Benjamin was not coming from behind, but instead was watching Warholm pulling away from him. And it was McMaster coming from behind to catch Benjamin before the line for silver. Warholm's winning time of 46.89 was the eighth time he has run under 47 seconds, a time that had only been achieved once before 2018. It was Warholm's third World Championship gold medal in this event.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition, records were as follows:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 48.70.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+2), was as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first four athletes in each heat (Q) and the next four fastest (q) qualified to the semi-finals.\nSemi-finals.\nThe first 2 athletes in each heat (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) qualified to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started on 23 August at 21:50."

Lamecha Girma had taken silver twice in a row and another at the Olympics. The difference this year was that Girma had taken down Saif Saaeed Shaheen's world record in Paris just over a month earlier. And he didn't just nip the record, he took a second and a half out of it, uncontested.\nNobody wanted to take the lead, that duty relegated to Simon Sundström in a pedestrian 67 first lap. But that wasn't slow enough so Leonard Bett slowed it down to a 69 and then 66's to get the field through 5 laps. Girma was always lurking about second place, now it was time to start racing. The next lap was just over 60 seconds. After spending a couple of laps at the back of the pack, El Bakkali drifted up to mark Girma. When the speed came, only Abraham Kibiwot was able to go with the big two. By the bell, he too had lost contact. On the first barrier after the bell, Kibiwot crashed. Nobody else was left in the picture. It wasn't the kind of breakaway speed the days of Ezekiel Kemboi, but El Bakkali pushed the backstretch to pull even with Girma with 200 to go. He opened up a step going in to the last water jump and continued to pull away. Even though El Bakkali slowed to wave at the crowd as he crossed the finish line, he still won by 10 metres. Far adrift from the leaders, Kibiwot came back to outsprint Bett to get the bronze. Including the Olympics it was three global championships in a row to have El Bakkali first, Girma second and a Kenyan in third.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 8:15.00.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+2), was as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first 5 athletes in each heat (Q) qualify to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started on 22 August at 21:42."

It was the 19th edition of this relay at the World Athletics Championships since 1983.\nSummary.\nAfter procedure modifications, the fastest qualifiers were assigned outside lanes, thus more favorable, wider turns. With one of the fastest starters in history, 2019 100m champion Christian Coleman out of the blocks, USA was making up the stagger on Japan, the only team to its outside. A couple of lanes inside, Jamaica's Ackeem Blake was gaining on South Africa between them. USA clearly passed first to 2022 100m champion Fred Kerley, Jamaica passed late in the zone to Oblique Seville but the same time as GBR passed to Zharnel Hughes. USA made the second pass from Kerley to Brandon Carnes ahead, but they were slowed by two attempts to transfer the baton. Jamaica to Ryiem Forde and GBR to Adam Gemili passed about even, and Italy's quick pass from Olympic Champion Marcell Jacobs to Lorenzo Patta put them into contention. Through the turn, Jamaica and Italy gained ground. Jamaica passed to their surprise National Champion Rohan Watson less than a metre behind USA. But USA had the double sprint winner Noah Lyles on anchor. Lyles opened up a 4 metre gap on his leg for a clear American victory. Italy passed to Filippo Tortu a metre down to Jamaica, but Tortu reversed that and gained a couple of metres for a clear second. Watson was able to hold off GBR's Eugene Amo-Dadzie and Japan's fast closing Abdul Hakim Sani Brown to retain bronze. It was Jamaica's first 4x100 medal since the retirement of Usain Bolt. Upon crossing the finish line, Lyles held up 3 fingers for the cameras to celebrate his third gold medal at these championships.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition, records were as follows:\nQualification system.\nAfter the postponement for COVID-19 pandemic reasons of the 2023 World Relays to 2024 Nassau, the modified system to qualify automatically is to have finished in the first eight (finalists) at 2022 World Championships, in Eugene, completed by eight more 2022-2023 top lists' teams.\nParticipating teams.\nTop list before the 30 July 2023:\n2022 Top list.\nThe qualification period has started on 31 July 2022 and closes on 30 July 2023.

In the first heat USA was able to hold off a hard charging team from India setting the Asian Record. The top 4 from that heat were the top 4 qualifiers.\nIn the final, USA's bronze medalist Quincy Hall was out fast, making up the 3 turn stagger distance on GBR's Alex Haydock-Wilson. Inside of Hall, France Ludvy Vaillant, Jamaica Rusheen McDonald and India Muhammed Anas were all running well. USA exchanged first to Vernon Norwood. Jamaica was next, but Roshawn Clarke did shuffle step that delayed his start, evening the chase group and letting Norwood have a bigger advantage. After the break, Gilles Biron brought France into second place, closing down to 5 metres by the head of the strightaway. From there, Norwood opened up another 3 metres before handing off to Justin Robinson. France was able to make a clean handoff to David Sombé and GBR's Charlie Dobson was able to pass to Lewis Davey unobstructed, but Botswana's veteran Baboloki Thebe came into the passing zone inside of Jamaica, while Laone Ditshetelo was waiting outside of Jamaica. Thebe cut through the middle of Jamaica's handoff from Clarke to Zandrion Barnes, then after handing off awkwardly, Thebe tripped making India's Muhammed Ajmal Variyathodi have to jump to hurdle Thebe. Botswana would get disqualified for interference after the race, but Jamaica and India were disadvantaged and Botswana was still on the track. GBR got ahead of France down the backstretch, with Botswana ahead of Jamaica. Sombé went round the outside to pass Dobson, Ditshetelo then passed on the inside. By gain being on the inside, Ditshetelo had to slow to pass behind GBR, but he still had to cut across two lanes to hand off. USA handed off clean to Rai Benjamin still 8 metres ahead of the field. France's Téo Andant got out with a 3 metre advantage on GBR's Rio Mitcham. Jamaica's Antonio Watson was another 3 metres down to GBR, with Botswana's Leungo Scotch nagging him on the inside. Down the backstretch, Watson made up those 3 metres, pulling even with Mitcham, but Mitcham held him to the outside entering the final turn. Watson dropped back for one more run at it coming off the turn, but instead Mitcham came off the turn sprinting after Andant. Up front Benjamin finished 10 metres up on France while GBR closed to 2 metres behind at the finish.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition, records were as follows:\nQualification standard.\nThe original standard to qualify automatically for entry was to finish in the first 12 at the 2023 World Athletics Relays, completed by 4 top lists' teams; with the postponement of the World Relays event due to ongoing pandemic conditions in the host city of Guangzhou, this was changed to the top eight teams from the 2022 World Athletics Championship, plus the next eight best international teams, based on performances in official competitions between 31 July 2022 and 20 July 2023.\nThe top 8 teams from the 2022 World Athletics Championships: \nTop list before the 30 July 2023\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+2), is as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first three in each heat (Q) and the next two fastest (q) qualified for the final.

With tight turns, several athletes slipped and fell trying to compete at high speed.\nFrom the gun, returning silver medalist Koki Ikeda went to the front, creating a gap over a pack led by Salih Korkmaz and two time defending champion Toshikazu Yamanishi. On the fifth lap, Ikeda dropped a 3:49 to open up an 8 second lead. By the half way point he had expanded that gap to 15 seconds. From that commanding lead, Ikeda began to show signs of weakness. Lap times in the low 3:50's became high 3:50's while the chase group was picking up speed. On the 15th lap, Álvaro Martín put the hammer down, dropping a 3:43 lap and pulling next to Ikeda. Martín followed that with a 3:48 crushing Ikeda's enthusiasm. Caio Bonfim, Perseus Karlström and Evan Dunfee were the next to pass Ikeda and set off in chase of Martín. Over the next three laps, Martín opened up 13 seconds over his chasers. He was able to celebrate on the final lap while Karlström was doing a 3:48 behind him to separate from Bonfim and capture silver.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 1:20:100.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (CEST), was as follows:\nResults.\nThe race was started on 19 August at 10:50."

Two of them were unable to clear 5.75 again in the final. Through the next height of 5.85m, only five got over the bar. World record holder / defending champion Armand Duplantis and Thibaut Collet remained perfect. At 5.90m Ernest John Obiena, Chris Nilsen and Collet cleared on their first attempt. Kurtis Marschall missed his first attempt, then passed to the next height. Duplantis passed it entirely. At 5.95m, Marschall redeemed his pass, with a first attempt clearance. Marschall is one of only three people to have bested Duplantis in a global competition, at the 2016 U20 Championships when Marschall was 19 and Duplantis was 17. Obiena, Duplantis and Nilsen all followed along making it on their first attempts. Collet missed. The tie was broken putting Duplantis into the lead. Collet passed to the next height, 6 metres. Only Obiena and Duplantis had made 6.00 this year. Duplantis made it easily on his first attempt. Obiena made it on his second. None of the others were able to get over the bar. With two misses each earlier in the competition, Nilsen and Marschall were left with bronze. So Obiena and Duplantis would go to 6.05m. Obiena missed his first attempt, after Duplantis made his first attempt, Obiena passed to the next scheduled height, 6.10m. No previous competition had two competitors left in the competition at . Only Sergey Bubka, Renaud Lavillenie and Duplantis had ever made it. Inexperienced at this height, Obiena missed his first attempt. Duplantis made it to remain perfect through the competition. After Obiena failed on his final attempt, Duplantis was confirmed for the gold medal. Now it was time to move the bar up to a world record attempt. Nobody had ever made an attempt at before. With the crowd eagerly watching and clapping in unison, over the next 20 minutes Duplantis made three attempts, but as in all pole vault competitions, they either end in withdrawal or failure.

It took exactly 8 metres to qualify, 7.99m did not make it.\nIt took 8 attempts in the first round before Thobias Montler achieved the first 8 metre jump and that was exactly 8.00m. The next jumper was Olympic Champion and returning silver medalist Miltiadis Tentoglou, who jumped 8.50m. Now the competition got serious. Next on the runway, Pinnock jumped 8.40m. At the end of the round, defending champion Wang Jianan did an 8.05m to move into third. The next jumper starting the second round, 2019 champion Tajay Gayle displaced Wang with an 8.17m. That lasted three jumpers until McLeod displaced him with an 8.27m. When Pinnock took his second attempt, it was also measured at 8.50m--a tie. The tie is broken with the second best attempt, so Pinnock's 8.40m put him in the lead. In the third round, Tentoglou jumped 8.39m, just one cm short of Pinnock's second best. And that was the way it would remain until the final attempts when Gayle's last attempt also was measured at 8.27m, another tie broken by his 8.17m. Suddenly off the podium, next on the runway, McLeod was only able to muster a 7.19m. Next up, Tentoglou hit to take the lead.

In the semi-finals, Jackson, Richardson and Ta Lou were all in semi #2, with only two automatic qualifiers. Jackson and Ta Lou ended up in a virtual tie at 10.79 leaving Richardson to have to wait in the holding room. Her 10.84 easily held up but because she finished third in the semis, she was given an outside lane in the final.\nIn the final, the slowest qualifier Ewa Swoboda got the marginally best start, but the field got out to a fairly even start, save Richardson who was slightly behind. \"Mommy Rocket” Fraser-Pryce did not get out to her typical dominating start. Over the next 30 metres, Fraser-Pryce, Jackson and Swoboda gained a slight edge on the rest of the field. Out in lane 9, Richardson recaptured the lost ground from the start to pull even with the Ta Lou and Swoboda. With 40 meters to go, Jackson had gained a slight edge on Fraser-Pryce, but Swoboda had not gone away. Behind them, Julien Alfred, Ta Lou and Richardson had emerged from the others. Coming into the finish, the two Jamaican athletes were focusing on each other in the center of the track as Richardson picked off Asher-Smith, Swoboda, Ta Lou, Fraser-Pryce, and finally Jackson with 15 meters to go. Richardson crossed the line with her arms outstretched and emerged victorious by .07 seconds, Jackson in 2nd and the defending champion Fraser-Pryce in 3rd.

The third semi was loaded with the defending champion, Shericka Jackson, the newly crowned 100 metres champion, Sha'Carri Richardson, and perennial finalist, 2017 silver medalist Marie-Josée Ta Lou. With only two automatic qualifying spots, something had to give. Ta Lou had to get one of the time qualifying spots and was relegated to lane 2 in the final.\nIn the final, the staggers mostly held true halfway through the turn, then Jackson began to edge forward with Dina Asher-Smith and Gabrielle Thomas showing a slight advantage.\nAs they reached the straightaway, Jackson had a clear 2 metre lead with Thomas just barely ahead of Richardson, Asher-Smith, Julien Alfred and Daryll Neita. Jackson continued to power away, the winner was not going to be in doubt. Thomas separated, with Richardson also moving forward. Jackson let off the gas a couple of steps before the finish line, her time of 21.41 improved her standing as #2 performer of all time, just .07 short of Florence Griffith-Joyner's 35 year old world record.

Aside from the withdrawals, some big names also failed to make it past the first round. Defending champion and #6 all time Shaunae Miller-Uibo was not back in full form, as she returned to the track just four months after giving birth to her first child. Another big name that failed to make it to the semi final round was world number three Britton Wilson, who finished last in her opening heat. All of the semi-finalists had sub-50 credentials, six of them broke 50 in the semi final round. That also meant they all had a sub-50 recently in their legs.\nIn the final, Lieke Klaver was out fast, making up the stagger on Natalia Kaczmarek to her outside down the backstretch. After the half way mark, returning silver medalist Marileidy Paulino began to make up ground on returning bronze medalist Sada Williams to her outside. When Paulino hit the 100 metre start line, she had a step on Klaver and two more on her next pursuers Williams, Rhasidat Adeleke and Kaczmarek. Down the stretch, Klaver was gritting her teeth but was moving backward relative to Kaczmarek, Adeleke and Williams, but Paulino was so far this was clearly a battle just for silver. Kaczmarek emerged as the next best, holding a step on Williams as Adeleke faded. Paulino finished 6 metres up on Kaczmarek with Williams taking a second bronze in a row.\nPaulino's 48.76 National Record makes her the eleventh fastest in history.

After winning the 2020 Olympics and 2022 World Championships, Athing Mu started looking for new horizons to conquer. Hurdler Sydney McLaughlin, also training under Bobby Kersee, staked out the 400 metres, so even though Mu was an NCAA Champion, sub-50 performer in that event, Mu focused her season efforts on the longer 1500 metres, only running one 800 metres race before these championships. 2022 silver medalist Keely Hodgkinson, who gave Mu a scare in Eugene, came in as the world leader for 2023; her only defeat, a tactical masterclass from Commonwealth champion Mary Moraa at the Lausanne Diamond League.\nDrama ensued in the semi-finals as Mu and Prudence Sekgodiso collided, turning her sideways. After recovering her balance, Mu had to run around five athletes to get back to a qualifying second place behind 2022 bronze medalist Mary Moraa. British number two Jemma Reekie, under a fresh coaching team, impressed in the semi-final to put herself forward as a wild-card medal chance in the final.\nIn the final, Mu went out fast, first to the break line with Moraa uncharacteristically holding back. She was followed by Hodgkinson, Moraa, and Reekie. Mu was occupying the outside of lane one, taking as much space as possible. The group stayed together as the bell came at a swift but not brutal 56.6. Through the penultimate turn and down the backstretch, Mu tried to get separation, but with her backwards-leaning running style, Moraa would not go away. Hodgkinson and Reekie stayed tucked in close behind to make it a foursome. Having spent most of the race in lane two, coming into the home stretch, Moraa launched her kick, followed by Hodgkinson on the inside. When challenged, Mu had no answer. Moraa passed on the outside, and then Hodgkinson passed on the inside. Moraa continued on to a two-metre victory over Hodgkinson, who had her first major championship victory over Mu, but had to settle for a third consecutive global silver medal. Mu held on to finish two metres behind Hodgkinson for bronze, still six metres ahead of fast-closing Raevyn Rogers, passing Reekie as she had done in Tokyo.\nThe race was acclaimed as one of the highlights of the championships, reinforcing the emerging and dramatic three-way rivalry between Moraa, Mu and Hodgkinson set to dominate the event for years to come, and acknowledging Reekie as one of the women most likely to bridge the gap to the Big Three.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition, records were as follows:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 1:59.80.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+2), was as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first 3 athletes in each heat (Q) and the next 3 fastest (q) qualified for the semi-finals.\nSemi-finals.\nThe first 2 athletes in each heat (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) qualified for the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started on 27 August at 20:45."

Both Hassan and Kipyegon were back, but Kipyegon was now the world record holder, and not only in the 1500 m; she had also taken down Hassan's mile record and the 5000 m record as well, all this year.\nThis year, Hassan dropped to the back as usual, but Kipyegon went right to the front, sub-31 for the first 200m. Taking her cue, Ciara Mageean, Diribe Welteji and Nelly Chepchirchir rushed to the front, later joined by Laura Muir. The pace relaxed to a more realistic 65 by the end of the first lap, and 66 for the second. It wasn't until 500 to go that Hassan made any serious effort to move forward. Ten metres before the bell, Kipyegon began to accelerate, starting to put a slight gap on the next pursuer Welteji. Hassan started the last lap 5 metres down, passing Jessica Hull into 6th place, with the fastest women in the world sprinting ahead of her. She moved into lane 2 and started passing in the turn. With 200 to go, Hassan got by Mageean into third place, but Kipyegon still had the 5-metre gap. Through the final turn, Hassan managed to get to Welteji's shoulder, but having spent so much effort to get there, she would get no further. Kipyegon still had her gap, now over both of them, which would prove to be insurmountable all the way to the finish. Hassan couldn't find another gear to overtake Welteji for silver.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 4:03.50.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC +2), was as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nFirst 6 of each heat (Q) qualified to the semi-finals.\nSemi-finals.\nFirst 6 of each semi-final (Q) qualified to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started on 22 August at 21:33."

Still, with the heats being conducted in the heat of 31°C (88°F) temperatures, the elite athletes had little interest in running a hard race except World U20 double Champion Agate Caune. In the first heat, the 19 year old captured the crowd by taking the pace out. After getting jostled in a tight slow moving pack for the first 200 metres, she stepped to the side and around the pack. Quickly, she separated from the pack, clicking off 70 second laps, while the peloton was doing more relaxed 73s. By the ninth lap, she had a 23 second, about 150 metre, advantage. Slowly the peloton began to reel in the rebellious teenager as the strain began to show on her face. 600 metres from the finish, 10,000 metre gold medalist Gudaf Tsegay started an extended kick for home. Returning silver medalist Beatrice Chebet and 2019 silver medalist Margaret Kipkemboi followed her and the pack stretched out, the gap to Caune was shrinking. She eventually was caught but kept her wits about her. Caune continued on to finish in fourth place qualifying her for the finals with a new personal best. In the second heat, they ran about 25 seconds faster, with the two favorites; new world record holder Faith Kipyegon and triple threat Olympic Champion Sifan Hassan sprinting it out to satisfy their competitive juices. Hassan won the heat by .02 seconds.\nWith all the drama just to qualify for the final, could the final live up? Even before the start, Caune did not appear due to a pelvic injury. With new rules in place, she was replaced at the last minute by the #17 qualifier Francine Niyomukunzi. The race started off with Tsegay moving out to a 65-second first lap opening up a gap. Then she backed off the accelerator, letting Ejgayehu Taye take the pace down to 75. Then she sped up to a 70 as both the Ethiopian and Kenyan teams dominated the front, then slowed down to 77. Kipyegon came forward to guide the pace to the slower speeds. Lilian Kasait Rengeruk took a couple of laps until Tsegay moved up to the 71 and a couple of 70-second laps. Through all these maneuvers, 14 women were still in contact with the lead, waiting. With a lap and a half to home, it was racing time. Kipyegon hit the front. Hassan moved up from mid-pack to Kipyegon's shoulder. The pace was quickening but only a few were dropping off the back. From 300 to 200 to go, they sped into a controlled sprint. Tsegay couldn't keep up. A gap appeared with Kipyegon, Hassan, and Chebet as the likely medalists. All three sprinted for home but the order and spacing didn't change. 13 women finished in less than 7 and a half seconds. Kipyegon got her double. After falling in the 10,000 finish, Hassan is leaving with medals in her other two events, anticipating running the Chicago Marathon in just 6 weeks.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 14:57.00.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC +2), was as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nFirst 8 of each heat (Q) qualified to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started on 26 August at 20:50."

At 1:15 p.m., Hassan's first heat of the 1500 was scheduled. That race was postponed an hour, shortening her rest time before this race, scheduled at 8:55 p.m. Meanwhile her competitors were rested and focused on this one race, anticipating Hassan's kick as a factor they needed to beat. Defending champion Letesenbet Gidey succeeded last year, winning by hundredths of a second as all the medalists held off Hassan.\nThe race started off slowly, Natosha Rogers relegated to the lead for three laps before handing the duty off to Camilla Richardsson who held it for the next eleven laps. Hassan took an even slower approach, dropping to dead last. \nWith eleven laps to go, Agnes Jebet Ngetich led the Kenyan team to the front, with the Ethiopian contingent marking the move, then Gudaf Tsegay took them forward. As the pace quickened, slower athletes fell off the pace, but Hassan was always at the back of the group still in contact with the lead. Gidey took her turn in the lead, then Ejgayehu Taye took them to three laps to go. Grace Nawowuna burned the next lap breaking the lead group down to ten. The Ethiopians asserted themselves into Tsegay and Gidey leading most of the penultimate lap. They continued to accelerate through the bell, with Hassan running around the field from tenth to first during the penultimate turn. Down the backstretch and through the final turn only the Ethiopians were able to chase. Hassan looked back to see she had the edge on Gidey but Tsegay would not go away. Hassan had a one metre lead at the start of the home stretch, but Tsegay kept edging closer. Hassan drifted out into lane 2, making Tsegay's path longer, suddenly, 20 metres from home, Hassan's legs went out from under her and she fell to the track. Tsegay continued on to victory. 7 metres back, Gidey held off Taye to complete the medals and a sweep for Ethiopia. Hassan got up and walked on to the finish.

        "text": "The women's 100 metres hurdles at the 2023 World Athletics Championships was held at the National Athletics Centre in Budapest from 22 to 24 August 2023.\nSummary.\nIn the first round, former world record holder Kendra Harrison ran 12.24, equalling her own #4 performance in history, leaving her with three of the top 5 races ever. Even her 12.33 in the semi-finals had only been beaten by ten women ever, but four of them made the finals along with her: Tobi Amusan, the defenging champion who set the world record in the semi-final round at the previous championships; Jasmine Camacho-Quinn, Olympic Champion; Nia Ali, 2019 champion; and Danielle Williams, the 2015 champion. From that elite field, Devynne Charlton was the first one over the first hurdle. Charlton maintained that advantage as Camacho-Quinn and Harrison were trying to reel her in while Ali was hitting hurdles. Almost unnoticed in lane 2, Williams was getting up a head of steam, pulling even with Charlton by the fifth hurdle and taking a clear lead by the seventh. By the eighth, Harrison had gotten by Charlton and had separated to second. At the ninth, Camacho-Quinn got past Charlton and moving the fastest. Camacho-Quinn and Harrison cleared the last hurdle together, still marginally behind Williams. Camacho-Quinn closed quickly to make a photo finish with Williams, leaving Harrison with bronze. The photo gave it to Williams.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 12.78 seconds.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+2), is as follows:\nResults.\nRound 1 (heats).\nRound 1 will take place on 22 August, with the 43 athletes involved being split into 5 heats of 9 athletes each.

In 2023, the 23-year-old Dutch woman broke the world indoor record over 400 metres flat, as well as her own European record over the 400 metres hurdles. Bol remained unbeaten in all her hurdles races since the 2022 final and her world-leading time of 51.45 s was almost 2 seconds faster than anyone else had run this year. After 2019 champion and #3 all time Dalilah Muhammad failed to qualify for the final, Bol's biggest opponent seemed to be the 2015 silver medalist and #5 all time Shamier Little, who posted the fastest qualifying time in the semi-finals. Other medal hopefuls were Bahraini Kemi Adekoya, who set Asian records in both the preliminary heats and semi-finals, and 2019 bronze medalist Rushell Clayton from Jamaica, who set a personal best in the semi-finals.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition, records were as follows:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 54.90.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+2), was as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first four athletes in each heat (Q) and the next four fastest (q) qualify to the semi-finals.\nSemi-finals.\nThe first 2 athletes in each heat (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) qualify to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was started on 24 August at 21:49."

The USA replaced Tamara Clark and Melissa Jefferson with 200 metre silver medalist Gabby Thomas and 100 metre Gold Medalist Sha'Carri Richardson.\nCôte d'Ivoire set an African record of 41.90 in the heats.\nIn the final, out of the blocks, USA's Tamari Davis gained against the stagger of Jamaica's Natasha Morrison who in turn was gaining on GBR's Asha Philip. USA passed first to Twanisha Terry. Jamaica passed late to their fifteen time World Championship medalist Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce who recaptured some of the distance lost, passing GBR's Imani-Lara Lansiquot down the backstretch. USA and Jamaica passed virtually together, but that meant USA in the inside had the advantage. This exchange was a disaster for Côte d'Ivoire as Marie-Josée Ta Lou tripped over Jessika Gbai, both athletes crashing to the track. Thomas brought USA around the turn ahead of Jamaica's Shashalee Forbes, only GBR with Bianca Williams and the Netherlands with Nadine Visser still battling for the bronze. Tasa Jiya started running too early, never connecting with Visser and GBR had clear sailing to bronze. Richardson got the baton for USA two metres up on Jamaica's Jackson. The United States was clear to win with Jamaica two metres back and GBR's Daryll Neita 10 metres back. The winning time of 41.03 took down Jamaica's Championships Record and was the fourth best time ever run, the third best by an American squad.

Defending champion Poland had a rougher time getting into the final, their anchor leg Patrycja Wyciszkiewicz-Zawadzka finding herself on the deck at the beginning of her leg in a multi-athlete collision on the exchange. After finishing last, Poland was added as a 9th finalist by the referee.\nWith only one substitution allowed between the heats and the final, Netherlands put their fresh athlete Liemarvin Bonevacia on the first leg. He did what was asked of him, holding his own against USA's Justin Robinson to hand off barely behind. Netherlands' other 400 star, Lieke Klaver, pushed the turn to barely beat Rosey Effiong to the break. Effiong didn't go away until the final metres, Klaver handing off with a slight lead. GBR was 5 metres back with France another 10 metres back. USA's next runner was their substitute, Matthew Boling, a step behind Klein Ikkink. Boling ran on the outside of lane 1 to pass Ikkink by the end of the first turn. Ikkink stuck to Boling until the final straight when he edged by to hand off to the star, Bol. With a personal best a full second slower than Bol, Alexis Holmes ran a step behind and wouldn't go away. Coming off the final turn, Holmes tried to put a kick on Bol and was gaining down the home stretch. The gap narrowed and narrowed as Holmes pulled even. Ten metres from the finish, Bol started to lean for the finish and crashed to the track, Holmes completing the final steps for a USA victory. Bol righted herself, but before she could cross the finish line, Yemi Mary John passed Bol to give GBR silver, the British four having maintained a third place position from the first leg, and running their second national record of the day. Bol was able to get across the line in third place, but in the fall she had dropped the baton, which landed inside the track across the finish line. Crossing the finish line without the baton made NED officially a DNF, did not finish. The Czech Republic took the bronze medal.\nAlmost lost in the finish line drama, the USA set a new World Record in the relatively new event, taking over a half second off the time set by another American winning team at the inaugural mixed relay in 2019.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were matched or set at the competition:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was to finish in the first 8 at 2022 World Athletics Championships, completed by 8 top lists' teams.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (CEST), was as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first three in each heat (Q) and the next two fastest (q) qualified for the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was held at 21:49 on August 19."

Neither could make it on their first two attempts. On her third attempt, Kennedy cleared for another National Record. Moon also cleared and the bar went up to 4.95m. Neither of them could negotiate the height in their three attempts. \nAfter Moon missed, the officials spoke with the athletes. By rule, when a tie occurs for first place, a jump off is held, where they continue to jump at first the missed height, then the bar gets lowered until one misses and the other makes it.

In the first round, returning silver medalist Shanieka Ricketts got things started with a 14.84m. Maryna Bekh-Romanchuk then put up 15.00m almost answered immediately by Leyanis Pérez with a 14.96m. Six jumps into the competition, there was already what would prove to be medal winning jumps. Rojas later fouled. Rickets improved on her second attempt to 14.87m. Rojas' second attempt was only 14.33m, which put her in a tie with Keturah Orji for the seventh and thus last qualifying position. In the third round, Kimberly Williams jumped 14.38m to take the seventh spot. And Rojas was unable to improve on her third attempt, only making 14.26m. With only 8 getting their final 3 jumps, to break the tie, they look at the second best jump for each athlete. Rojas was fortunate that Orji had fouled her other two attempts. Rojas made the final eight by the skin of her teeth. She didn't make use of the first two extra jumps, though none of the other leaders improved either. In the unfamiliar position of starting the final round. Taking a safe mark, Rojas took off with her toes barely touching the leading edge of the board, giving up most of the 20cm width, but she clearly did not foul. She bounded out to , in turn jumping from eighth to first. All the other competitors still had one more attempt to improve. Rickets used that opportunity to improve to 14.93m, but that wasn't enough to get her a medal. Rojas had to sweat it out as neither Pérez or Bekh-Romanchuk were able to improve and Rojas was able to squeak into a fourth consecutive World Championship.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 14.52 m.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+2), was as follows:\nResults.\nQualification.\nAthletes attaining a mark of at least 14.30 metres ( Q ) or at least the 12 best performers ( q ) qualify for the final.\nFinal.\nResults:"

The team is coached by Donan Cruz, who is in his third season as head coach, and only the third head coach since the team's founding in 1964. \nThe Cardinals are a charter member of the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (MIVA), which they have been competing in since the varsity program's inception in 1964. The team has won 22 regular season MIVA titles and 15 tournament titles. They are the fourth-winningest collegiate men's volleyball program, and second by total wins, with an overall record of 1242-527 (.701) over 59 seasons. They currently host their home matches at Worthen Arena on the Ball State campus.\nArena.\nThe Cardinals play their home matches at Worthen Arena on campus. They began playing at the arena in 1992, after having spent more than 28 seasons at Irving Gymnasium. At the conclusion of the 2023 season, the Cardinals hold a 284-93 (.753) in Worthen Arena.\nWorthen Arena played host to the 1992 NCAA men's volleyball tournament.\nCoaching History.\nSince the team's founding in 1964, the men's volleyball program has had only three head coaches. Dr. Don Shondell founded the men's volleyball program and served as its first head coach. Dr. Shondell was also one of the founders of the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association. The Cardinals have competed in the conference since its founding. \nDr. Shondell was the head coach of the men's volleyball program for 34 years and amassed a record of 769-280-6 (.732). Dr. Shondell is the second-winningest coach in NCAA Division I men's volleyball history, behind former UCLA head coach Al Scates. In 1996, Dr. Shondell was inducted into the International Volleyball Hall of Fame.\nIn 1998, Dr. Shondell retired as head coach of the men's volleyball program and was replaced by then-assistant coach, Joel Walton. Over 23 seasons as head coach, Walton amassed a record of 413-258 (.636), ranking him the twelfth winningest coach in NCAA Division I men's volleyball history. Walton remained the head coach of the men's volleyball program for 23 seasons until his retirement in 2021.\nIn June 2021, Donan Cruz was named the third head coach in program history. In Cruz's first year as head coach, he led the Cardinals to their first MIVA regular season championship, conference tournament championship, and NCAA Tournament berth since 2002. In his second season, the Cardinals were again the regular season champions but fell to Ohio State in the MIVA tournament championship match."

Its collection now includes thousands of vintage boards, memorabilia, artifacts, a library, VHS, painting art, skating ramps, and a skate shop. In an interview given to the Ventura County Star, founder Todd Huber commented, “This space is such a positive thing, not only for Simi Valley, but for skateboarders too. They really deserve a spot like this that’s honoring skateboarding.”\nIn 2009, the museum began inducting individuals into the Hall of Fame.

The first six selections will be set via a lottery, with first round picks belonging to the remaining lottery participants set in reverse order of regular season winning percentage. To complete the first round, playoff teams will select in an order that combines postseason finish, revenue sharing status, and reverse order of winning percentage. Reverse order of regular season winning percentage and postseason finish will be used to set the draft order for rounds two through 20.\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks were awarded a Prospect Promotion Incentive Pick after Corbin Carroll won the 2023 National League Rookie of the Year Award. The Baltimore Orioles also received a Prospect Promotion Incentive Pick after Gunnar Henderson won the 2023 American League Rookie of the Year Award.\nThe Cleveland Guardians were awarded the first overall pick after winning the 2024 MLB Draft Lottery. It will be the first time that the Guardians have the first overall pick in the MLB Draft.\nDraft lottery.\nThe 2024 MLB Draft Lottery took place on December 5, 2023, in Nashville, Tennessee during the Winter Meetings. The Washington Nationals were ineligible to participate in the lottery, as per a rule in the collective bargaining agreement between Major League Baseball and MLBPA that limits teams in larger markets from winning draft lottery picks in consecutive seasons. The following table lists the percentage chances for each seed to receive lottery picks as a result of the draft lottery.\nDraft selections.\nThe Mets, Yankees, and Padres exceeded the surcharge tax threshold in 2023 and did not win lottery picks, meaning that each will have their first round draft pick moved back ten slots."

        "text": "The 1921–22 YMCA College Maroons men's ice hockey season was the 18th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nThe '22 season was a complete disaster for the Maroons. The year began with the team losing their coach, Paul Otto, who sited too many other responsibilities as the reason for his departure. While Benny Leonard, the team captain and manager, agreed to act as coach for the year, he was caught short and only managed to schedule 6 games. To make matters worse, J. Howard Starr, the team best defenseman, could only play on occasion due to his studies. While the team was able to get Starr in the lineup for the first game, they were missing Delano who was recovering from surgery.\nA warm winter meant that most of the early-season training for the team happened off the ice and all of those degrading effects caused the Maroons to open the year with a bad defeat at the hands of Williams. The Ephs were by far the better team all game long and YMCA had no chance for victory in the match. After a subsequent loss to Amherst, Benny Leonard was admitted to hospital with acute Appendicitis and needed surgery to fix the issue. Because he was lost for the year, the team was now down to just one returning player (Courtney) with the rest of the club made up of new faces. While Courtney took over as captain, George Bergini, the coach of the Springfield Hockey Club, offered to help the team in its time of need and finished out the year as coach. Somewhat surprisingly, the team was able to win its next game but Rensselaer was and had been one of the worst programs for over a decade and the Maroons' victory had as much to do with the quality of their opponent as anything else.\nThe following week the team travelled to face Army and found themselves on the wrong end of a 0–7 beating. The shorthanded team got a small bit of good news heading into the rematch with Amherst; the Lord Jeffs were dealing with similar roster problems. YMCA had a chance to avenge their earlier defeat but, even handicapped, the Sabrinas were too much for the Maroons and handed them yet another shutout loss. YMCA ended the year with a second defeat of RPI, the only goal coming from Courtney. The poor but respectable record belied the terrible state the program was in. The situation was so bad that the program was shuttered for the following year.\nBenny Leonard served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "Mike Horton (born October 7, 1997) is an American football offensive guard who is a free agent. He played college football for the Auburn Tigers and has also been a member of the Carolina Panthers.\nEarly life.\nHorton was born in Atlanta, Georgia on October 7, 1996 or 1997. He attended Lakeside High School and was ranked a three-star prospect. He was a two-way player at tackle in football and also played basketball and competed in track and field. Horton was named a first-team all-region player, was selected to the Semper Fi All-American Bowl, and was ranked by 247Sports as one of the top-60 prospects in the state, additionally being ranked the 23rd-best nationally at his position by ESPN. He received interest from numerous NCAA Division I FBS teams and initially committed to play for the Florida Gators, but later flipped to Auburn.\nCollege career.\nAs a true freshman at Auburn in 2015, Horton redshirted. The following year, he appeared in 12 games, seeing extensive action as the sixth offensive lineman on the depth chart, often playing as an extra blocker in run formations. He started seven games in 2017, mainly as a left guard. Horton moved to right guard in 2018 but didn't have a great transition, ranking 627th out of 836 college lineman according to Pro Football Focus' rankings. He started 12 games as a senior in 2019, finishing his stint at the school with 32 career starts.\nProfessional career.\nCarolina Panthers.\nAfter going unselected in the 2020 NFL Draft, Horton was signed by the Carolina Panthers as an undrafted free agent. He was released at the final rosters cuts and was afterwards re-signed to the practice squad. He was elevated to the active roster as a COVID-19 replacement for their game against the New Orleans Saints, but did not play and returned to the practice squad afterwards. He was elevated again for the team's following game against the Atlanta Falcons, but was inactive. He was signed to a reserve/future contract on January 4, 2021.\nHorton was released at roster cuts again in 2021, being re-signed to the practice squad soon after. He was released from the practice squad on September 14, but was brought back on September 27. He was elevated to the active roster for their week 10 game against the Arizona Cardinals, and made his debut in the game, appearing on six special teams snaps, 24% of their total special teams snaps. He received another elevation for their game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in week 16 and appeared on two snaps. Horton was elevated for a final time against the New Orleans Saints one week later and played three snaps. He thus played in a total of three games in the 2021 season, appearing on 11 snaps. He signed a reserve/future contract on January 10, 2022. Horton was released by the Panthers following the 2022 preseason and was not re-signed to the practice squad.\nArlington Renegades.\nHorton was selected in the third round (18th overall) of the offensive line phase of the 2023 XFL Draft by the Arlington Renegades. He made the team's final roster and appeared in all 10 games as a starter, helping them win the 2023 XFL Championship Game over the DC Defenders. He was not part of the roster after the 2024 UFL dispersal draft on January 15, 2024."

        "text": "The women's extreme kayak event at the 2022 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships took place on 31 July 2022 at the Augsburg Eiskanal in Augsburg, with the time trials on 30 July 2022.\nCompetition format.\nThe extreme kayak event is split into two phases - qualification time trials and knockout phase where 4 paddlers race each other head-to-head. Top 20 paddlers from the qualification advance to the knockout phase plus the 12 next fastest paddlers from countries that have not qualified in the top 20. There are 8 heats in the first round of the knockout phase with the top 2 paddlers from each heat advancing to the next round. The same rules apply in quarterfinals and semifinals.\nPaddlers start their run by sliding off the starting platform several meters above the water. Then they must navigate the downstream and upstream gates. Unlike in classic slalom, paddlers are allowed to touch the gates and even intentionally move them with their paddle, but not with a free hand. There is also a designated zone where paddlers must perform an Eskimo roll.\nAthletes can be penalized in three ways in each round, by receiving a fault (FLT) or by being ranked as lower (RAL). Faults are incurred for false starts, missing gates or failing to correctly perform the Eskimo roll. Athletes are ranked as lower (RAL) if they breach the safety requirements of the competition, such as by holding back another athlete with their hands or paddle, deliberately paddling over another athlete's boat, or by making dangerous contact with another athlete's head or body - all other non-dangerous contact is allowed. In each round athletes are ranked first by the order in which they cross the finish line, with those incurring penalties ranked in the following order: FLT, RAL, DNF, .\nThe final classification of athletes is determined in the following manner: Athletes eliminated at any phase of the competition will be given their rank based on the comparison of the qualification times of athletes eliminated at the same phase. All 3rd ranked athletes will be ranked above all 4th ranked athletes. The final rank of athletes who did not progress to the heats is determined by their qualification results.\nResults.\nTime trials.\nTop 20 qualify automatically. The last 12 spots go to fastest paddlers from countries not yet qualified.\nKnockout rounds.\n&lt;br&gt;\nFinal ranking (Top 32).\nThe top 32 ranking determined by the knockout rounds. Bib numbers correspond to seeding after time trials."

        "text": "The 1925–26 Massachusetts Agricultural Aggies men's ice hockey season was the 18th season of play for the program. The Aggies were coached by Lorin Ball in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nThe beginning of the season was a bit of a mixed bag for the Aggies. Coach Ball got a large number of men to show up for tryouts, however, a warm winter left the team unable to practice on ice for large stretches of time. In the meantime, A slate of 12 games was put together and only one of the college hockey powers (Dartmouth) appeared on the schedule. The team had only three returning lettermen: Red Potter, Cary Palmer and team captain Buddy Moberg. Most of the prospective candidates had barely played before and needed as much ice time as possible to get themselves into shape. It wasn't until New Year's that the Aggies were able to get onto the ice and the approximately twenty five students were put through their paces.\nWhen the first game rolled around, the ice on Alumni Field Rink had been damaged by a warm spell that was followed by heavy snowfall. MIT, who were used to using the clean ice at Boston Arena, had less of a problem on the rough ice than the Aggies. The Engineers outskated MAC for most of the match and were able to build a 3–0 lead after two periods. The Aggie defense stiffened in the third but, as they still could not manufacture a goal, the game ended in defeat. The team looked much better in their second match a few days later. They pressed Hamilton, one of the best teams in the nation, hard. After the Continentals opened the scoring late in the first, MAC countered by attacking the Hamilton cage but were unable to score until the third when Forest tied the game. Shortly after Van Vleet gave Hamilton its second lead, the home team subbed in reserves on the forward line. The fresh troops immediately scored three goals to put the game out of reach. The Aggies continued their road trip with a stop in Troy the following night. Despite being tired from the previous game, Moberg's two goals were enough to earn MAC the win as the defense was aided by rough ice. The captain had been shifted to wing while Frese was moved up to center. Abrahamson, who had been one of several right wingers to this point, dropped back to take over the vacated defensive position next to Potter.\nThe following week, warm weather hit the area and caused the three game trip north to be cancelled. The team was also unable to get much practice in ahead of their meeting with Amherst and the results speak to that problem. Both the Aggies and the Lord Jeffs had trouble working as a team, though both were able to get several individual sallies up the ice. The defenses were able to stand first and end regulation without a single goal being scored. Two 5-minute overtime sessions were played without effect before the game was halted. Both teams were able to play on but the glare from the floodlights off of the ice left the players nearly blinded and both agreed to call the match a draw.\nIt was nearly two week before the team's next game but the time off seemed to work wonders for the Aggies. MAC played one its best games all season with the forwards acting they were on the same side for a change. While Middlebury scored early in the match, MAC was quick to tie the match. The referee ruled that the puck had entered the cage illegally and waved off the goal, returning the lead to the Panthers. The Aggies outplayed Middlebury in the second but found it impossible to score due to the brilliant performance of the Panther netminder. Forest finally got MAC on the board early in the third but the team was unable to take the lead. two 10-minute overtime periods were agreed to and the Vermont goalie turned aside everything that was sent his way. Middlebury managed to break the tie and held on to escape with a 2–1 win.\nIn spite of a snowstorm, MAC travelled to face Army for their next game. As they were want to do, the Aggies gave up the first goal but then shut down the Cadet offense for the rest of the match. After Potter tied the game, MAC hemmed Army in its own end for long stretches and Moberg was eventually able to get the winning goal with about 4 minutes to play. Three days later MAC allowed an early goal to New Hampshire but Forest was able to tie the game before the period was finished. Moberg and Frese added to the Aggies' total while the defense stopped the Wildcats from responding. The win put the team at .500 and gave them a chance at a winning season with just two games left.\nMAC arrived in Williamstown to face an Ephs squad in the middle of a tremendous season. The Purple skated proved as much with a 0–7 demolition of the visitors that saw the Aggies outplayed in all facets of the game. MAC was able to keep close in the first 20 minutes, however, a 5-goal explosion in the second ended any chance the Maroon players had. Williams deployed reserves in the third but even that couldn't help the Aggies to score. The final game was supposed to be a rematch with Amherst, however, warm weather reared its ugly head once more and the game had to be cancelled.\nDonald Williams served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;"

The season marked the 52nd basketball season for USF, the eleventh as a member of the American Athletic Conference, and the first season under head coach Amir Abdur-Rahim. The Bulls played their home games at Yuengling Center on the university's Tampa, Florida campus.\nIn the Week 14 poll on February 12, 2024, USF received five votes in the Coaches Poll (unofficially ranking them 40th), marking the first time since the final poll of the 2011–12 season in which USF has received votes in the Coaches Poll. In addition, the school also received seven votes in the AP poll (unofficially ranking them 43rd), also marking the first time the school received votes in both polls in the same week, along with only the third time the school received votes in the AP poll, after receiving 58 in the Week 6 poll in 1991–92 and two in the Week 13 poll in 2009–10. The following week (Week 15), the school set a record for most votes received in the Coaches Poll, receiving 45 in AP and 35 in Coaches (unofficially ranking them 31st and 29th, respectively).\nIn their February 18 win against No. 24 Florida Atlantic, USF set a new attendance record with 10,659 fans packing the Yuengling Center.\nOn February 25 after their win against SMU combined with losses by Charlotte and Florida Atlantic that weekend, USF clinched at least a share of the conference regular season title for the first time in school history. On March 2, they would clinch the outright title with their win over Charlotte.\nIn the Week 16 poll on February 26, 2024, USF was ranked No. 25 in both the AP and Coaches polls, marking the first time in school history the team was officially ranked in either poll. \nThe Bulls were ranked No. 24 in both the AP and Coaches polls during week 17. After a loss to Tulsa in the final game of the season, USF would drop out of the AP Top 25 for week 18; however, they would receive votes, unofficially ranking them 27th in the nation. That loss would also snap the Bulls program record setting 15-game win streak.\nOn March 15, Amir Abdur-Rahim was named a Naismith College Coach of the Year semifinalist. Two days later, the Bulls were given a berth in the National Invitation Tournament, their first postseason berth since 2018–19. They beat rival Central Florida in the first round their 25th win of the season setting a new program record before losing to VCU in the second round, ending their season.\nPrevious season.\nThe Bulls finished the 2022–23 season 14–18, 7–11 in AAC play, to finish in eighth place. They lost in the first round of the AAC tournament to East Carolina.\nOn March 10, 2023, the school fired head coach Brian Gregory after six seasons.

The season began in April in Cheltenham, England, and ended in October in Queen's Park, Brighton, England.\nSeason summary.\nPrior to the creation of the International Lawn Tennis Federation and the establishment of its world championship events in 1913 the Wimbledon Championships, the U.S. National Championships, the Irish Lawn Tennis Championships and the Northern Championships were considered by players and historians as the four most important tennis tournaments to win.\nThis year for women there would be a tennis circuit of sorts starting to form. 1881 also sees the first indoor tournament for women the Cheltenham Covered Court Championships organised by the Cheltenham Lawn Tennis Club and played on wood courts at the Imperial Winter Gardens, Cheltenham, England.\nAt the only major event to feature women's competition the Irish Championships in Dublin the women's singles and doubles events were not held, but a mixed doubles event was staged won by Ireland's Mary Abercrombie and England's William Renshaw. In terms of draw size the Exmouth Open was the largest as far as women competitors were concerned with 26 in the main singles draw.\nIn May 1881 the first national tennis association is formed that being the United States Lawn Tennis Association. At the first official U.S. National Championships there was no women's events and it would be eight years before there would be. In Australia the University of Sydney Lawn Tennis Club formed in 1881 and officially incorporated in 1885, was the only venue in the country following admission of women undergraduates to have active players.\nAt the 1881 Wimbledon Championships the world's first major tennis tournament, it still remained an all men's event, no women's events were staged. On 26 November 1881 indoor tennis was played inside the 7th Regiment Armory in New York City on with twelve courts for the use of women. In 1913 the International Lawn Tennis Federation was created, that consisted of national member associations. The ILTF through its associated members then became responsible for supervising women's tour events.\nSeason results.\nNotes 1: Challenge Round: the final round of a tournament, in which the winner of a single-elimination phase faces the previous year's champion, who plays only that one match.

First seed Carlos Alcaraz defeated second seed and four-time defending champion Novak Djokovic in five sets to win the title 1–6, 7–6(8–6), 6–1, 3–6, 6–4. At 4 hours and 42 minutes, it was the third-longest Wimbledon final in history by duration; the longest being the 2019 final (4 hours and 57 minutes), which also featured Djokovic, and the second longest being the 2008 final.\nDjokovic was aiming to win a fifth consecutive Wimbledon trophy (which would have equalled Björn Borg and Roger Federer's Open Era record), an eighth title overall (matching Federer's all-time record), and complete the third part of a prospective calendar year Grand Slam. Djokovic's loss was his first on Centre Court in a decade, his last defeat being the 2013 final to Andy Murray, and it was his only loss at the majors that year (he went on to win the US Open). Alcaraz retained the world No. 1 ranking with his victory, and became the first player outside the Big Four to win the tournament since Lleyton Hewitt at the 2002 Championships.\nAttendance.\nMany celebrities and public officials attended the match, including King Felipe VI, Daniel Craig, Ariana Grande, Idris Elba, Rachel Weisz, Brad Pitt, Emma Watson, Jonathan Bailey, Priyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas, Shakira, Imogen Poots, James Norton, Stan Smith, Chris Evert, Annabel Croft, and Stefan Edberg.\nCatherine, Princess of Wales, as patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, was in attendance with her husband (William, Prince of Wales) and two of their three children – Prince George and Princess Charlotte. In addition, Prince Michael of Kent and a number of other British royal family members were present."

        "text": "The 1927–28 Bowdoin Polar Bears men's ice hockey season was the 9th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nJust after Thanksgiving, the team met for the first time. Coach Houser had a sizable contingent of men trying out for the team led by captain Dick Thayer. While the rink was being rebuilt, the team played 'Houserball' to get in shape. New equipment for 12 men was ordered and set a goal for the 46 candidates. In addition to Houserball, coach Houser had the boys playing 'tag hockey'. Because ice was not yet available, the prospective players broke up into groups of six and arranged themselves on a field in the same formation that they would on the ice. A football was used in lieu of a puck to demonstrate the passing, movements and arrangement of players that they should understand once the Bears got onto the ice. While the team was training, the school also set about addressing an issue with the rink. Floodlight had been used in the past few years for night games, however, this caused glare to reflect off of the surface and into the players' eyes. To alleviate this problem, additional lighting was place over the rink. Due to the increasing popularity of the sport, the student council called for a referendum from the student body to vote on whether ice hockey would be made a major sport. Bates and Colby, the two in-state rivals for Bowdoin, had already adopted ice hockey as a major sport and there was an urgency from some quarters for the Polar Bears not to fall behind. After returning home from the winter break, the vote was overwhelmingly in favor of hockey being a major sport. By a count of 282 in favor and 32 against, the program was promoted to major status, joining the football, baseball and track programs. With the huge support it was hoped that the effort to secure an indoor rink would soon be adopted by the school but those plays were only in their planning stages.\nWhile receiving the good news, the team had been getting themselves arranged and were set for a busy opening week. A lack of ice time showed in their opening game of the season when they travelled down to Boston to take on Boston University. The Terriers got off to a quick start and score twice in the first three minutes. Dick and his younger brother Bob were the best Bowdoin could offer in the match, with Bob scoring twice, but they could never catch BU. The two succeeding games had to be postponed due to a lack of ice but the weather cooled down enough over the weekend to allow the first match with Bates to be held. Bowdoin was still hampered by a lack of teamwork and were unable to penetrate the Bobcat defense for large stretches of the game. They picked up the pace in the middle frame, managing to get 14 shots on goal, but the puck refused to enter the Garnet cage. Bates was able to score once in each period while the Polar Bears' only marker from Rice came with just 2 minutes left in the match.\nBowdoin hit the road for the next game and faced one of the best teams in the nation. Despite their lack of practice time, Yale took no pity on Bowdoin and hammered the Bears 0–8. Bowdoin returned home for their final match of the first half and played a much closer contest with New Hampshire. The two were tied for much of the game but the WIldcats were able to pull out a victory on a late third period goal.\nAfter ending the first half of their season without a win, Bowdoin needed a break to address their issues. After some hard work and fortunate ice time, the Polar Bears returned triumphantly by sandwiching a pair of wins over Colby around a second loss to Boston University. In their first game back, the lineup was altered, moving Rice and Bob Thayer to wing while allowing Stone and Rice to take over on defense. A strong third period saw Bowdoin score three goals to take a commanding lead that they would ride to their first win of the year. Bowdoin then played Acadia, their first game against a Canadian college, and doubled their win total. They weren't able to keep the winning streak alive as BU arrived in town to repeat the earlier match the following night. A few days after losing the rematch with BU, Bowdoin got off to a poor start against the Mules by allowing two goals in the first 6 minutes. Howland buckled down afterwards and refused to allow any more to Colby. His superlative goaltending enabled the Bears to tie the match before the period was out and then take a lead with two goals less than 5 minutes into the second. With a 2-goal lead, Bowdoin played a defensive game for the rest of the match and were content to lob the puck down into the Mules' end. The second win gave Bowdoin a shot at the state championship.\nBecause Colby had twice defeated Bates previously, Bowdoin was sitting atop the standings and a win over the Garnet would give the title outright. Because a match with MIT was cancelled due to warm weather next game ended up being against Bates for the title. The two teams ended up in a goaltending battle with Howland matching the Bobcat netminder, Violette, save for save. Near the end of the second, reserve player Parker got the puck out of a scrimmage in front of the Garnet cage and lifted it into the top corner of the net. It was Parker's only goal of the season and it turned into the biggest score for the Polar Bears as it won them the title.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The WBA, along with the Cape Cod League, was one of the first summer collegiate baseball leagues to be officially certified and supported by the NCAA in 1968, and is the direct predecessor to the well known Alaska Baseball League. The original ceased operation at the end of the 1972 season to make way for the ABL. The league was reformed in 1983 by the Humboldt Crabs, the only original WBA team in the new WBA, and played through the 2000 season.\nWestern Baseball Association (1967–69).\nIn 1967, the original league members were the Humboldt Crabs, Alaska Goldpanners, Grand Junction Eagles, Fallon Silver Circle/Nevada Copper Kings, Bellingham Bells, San Rafael Braves, Santa Rosa Rosebuds, and Mendocino Braves. The league president was Grand Junction manager Sam Suplizio and John L. Carbray served as league commissioner. Before the 1968 season, the Goldpanners, Nevada Copper Kings, and Mendocino Braves left the league and were replaced by the Yakima Indians and Milton-Freewater Twins. Before the 1969 season, Santa Rosa and San Rafael dropped out and the league added a team in Springfield Bulldogs.\nBig West Conference (1970–72).\nThe WBA was reorganized, a new commissioner and board of directors were announced and the league was renamed the Big West Conference before the 1970 season. As a part of the reorganization, the Alaska Goldpanners rejoined the league along with the newly established Anchorage Glacier Pilots, while Milton-Freewater and Yakima dropped out. For the 1971 season, the league petitioned for funding from Major League Baseball and multiple games between Anchorage and Humboldt were broadcast on television.\nWhile Bellingham, Grand Junction and Humboldt still played each other in 1972, the league was no longer official, and records were no longer kept. In 1974, the Glacier Pilots and Goldpanners formed the now famous Alaska Baseball League.\nChampions.\n^also won the NBC World Series\nWestern Baseball Association (1983–2000).\nIn August 1982, the Humboldt Crabs hosted the inaugural WBA West of the Rockies Tournament to help showcase teams that would join the newly reestablished Western Baseball Association in 1983. This iteration of the WBA, which played through the 2000 season, consisted mostly of teams from Northern California and Southern Oregon. The Sacramento Smokeys were the only team to play in every season of the reorganized WBA. Original members Fontanetti's Athletics and Humboldt Crabs played every year until 1997 and 1996 respectively. Other longtime members included the Seaside Bombers, Hollister Angels, San Francisco Senators, San Francisco Seals, San Jose Raiders and San Mateo Bulldogs."

        "text": "The 1921–22 Massachusetts Agricultural Aggies men's ice hockey season was the 14th season of play for the program. The Aggies were coached by Elton Mansell in his 5th season.\nSeason.\nThe school got a jump on the ice hockey season by having the rink ready by early November. Though it didn't have ice at the time, there was still an effort to get underway as soon as possible to give the team the best chance to produce a winning season. 20 men showed up for the first meeting but coach Mansell hoped to have as many as 30 by December after the football team had released its players. In the meantime, as many as 16 games were being planned up until mid-February. Aside from the roster turnover, the biggest change the team had to contend with was the abandonment of the rover position as MAC agreed to move towards 6-man hockey.\nAfter returning from the winter break, the Aggies started with a match against one of the top college teams in Dartmouth. \"Hubba\" Collins kicked off the scoring but the offense was unable to join in. MAC's defense, led by Collins, was able to hold off the Greens for much of the game, however, Dartmouth was slowly able to take over the match. While the Aggies ended up losing the match, they had acquitted themselves well with their strong performance. The Aggie's quality was born out in the next game when they upset Yale on the road. In front of 2,000 Bulldog supporters, Collins was again a terror at both ends, scoring twice in the first 11 minutes of the game. Yale cut into the lead before the period was out but a further goal from Sharky Lyons gave MAC a lead it would not relinquish. The rare defeat of an Ivy League team put the Aggies in the running to be the best of the small teams.\nAny pretensions that the team had were curtailed by an embarrassing loss to MIT. Through two periods the Aggies were the better of the two outfits but the team was unable to score. The hard pace caught up with MAC in the third and the tired bunch could do nothing to stem the onslaught from the Engineers. MIT scored six goals in the final frame to turn the match into a farce and send the bewildered Aggies packing. The team rebounded with a win over Amherst but the offense was still subpar. While MAC outshot the Lord Jeffs 51–20, they could only manage one score. Fortunately, Kroeck was equal to the task and posted his first shutout to bring the Aggies back to .500. The low-margin hockey continued against Bates when the team got a second shutout win.\nThe Aggies took a trip through New York in late January and ended up on the losing side of the ledger. MAC was stymied by a strong Cornell squad who scored thrice in the first 10 minutes of the game. Play evened out afterwards but only Gordon was able to break through for a goal. The following night, the team met Hamilton for their first game at the Russell Sage Rink, the first on-campus indoor facility in the country. The Continentals used the fast ice to their advantage and turned the match into a track meet. MAC was able to keep pace for the first half of the game and even managed to open the scoring on a shot from Hodsdon. Unfortunately, Hodsdon accidentally shot the puck into his own goal and kicked off a deluge from Hamilton. Over a 7-minute span in the third, the home team racked up four more goals and took control of the game. Two quick scores from MAC gave the Aggies a change but penalties to Collins and Lyons in the waning moments ended the comeback attempt. A few days later, MAC fought a pitch battle with Army that saw the Aggies narrowly hold off a determined Cadet squad. Lyons and Collins opened the game with goals in the first 8 minutes but the West Pointers closed the gap before the end of the frame. Army tied the game at the beginning of the second but Collins' second marker gave MAC the lead once more. After a quick goal from Army at the start of the frame, the Aggies picked up the pace in the third and hemmed Army in their own end for much of the period. With less than 2 minutes left, Lyons and Haskins teamed up in a rush down the ice with the former securing the game winner in thrilling fashion.\nThe following weekend, the team took a trip down to Philadelphia for their first games at the new Ice Palace. Despite their train arriving late, the team was able to win its first game over the St. Nicholas Hockey Club. The team was able to use the clean ice to skate up and down the rink, stunning the onlookers who weren't expecting such an effort from the Aggies. Collins was the star on both sides of the puck and opened the scoring, however, the team found itself down at the start of the third. After Doc Gordon tied the game with a low-angle shot, Shorty Hodsdon got his second goal of the year and put MAC into the lead with just 2 minutes to play. The following night, MAC was back on the ice against another professional outfit and still appeared to be their equals. Neither team managed to score in the first period, despite several attempts by Collins and Lyons. Collins finally got his team on the board midway through the second but the Quakers charged back to tie soon afterwards. Neither team seemed to able to take advantage until Quaker City changed to a 3-man defense that caught MAC off-guard. The home team scored four times in a 6-minute span and handed the Aggies another loss.\nThe team wrapped up its season with a rematch at Amherst and ended with a second shutout victory. Plimpton, the Sabrinas' goaltender, was the star of the game and kept his team in the match in the face of a withering attack from the Aggies. Eventually, something had to give and a goal from Haskins at the start of the third proved to be the game-winner. After the team's successful season, the financial difficulties of the athletic department came to the fore when the school decide against holding its customary banquet for the players. After an appeal to the student body, a banquet was held for both the ice hockey and basketball teams a month after the season ended.\nFrancis Tucker served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "1921–22 Bowdoin Polar Bears men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1921–22 Bowdoin Polar Bears men's ice hockey season was the 3rd season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nBowdoin began its third season with the promotion of last year's team captain, Allen Morrell, to the position of coach. Morrell was still enrolled at Bowdoin and still a member of the team but, after their poor results the year before, the club decided they needed to have someone in charge. Fellow senior Alonzo Holmes took over as captain and the team, searching for a better year, put together a 12-game schedule in early December. Unfortunately, the team began the year with a loss to their usual foe, Bates. Poor conditions had prevented the team from getting much practice in ahead of time and the game was played on rough ice that hampered both teams. The match was played with two 20-minute halves with the first using 7-man units while the teams dispensed with the rover in the second. Miguel was the star for the team, allowing just one goal to the Garnet, but the offense didn't give him any support and were shutout.\nThe team's first home game was due to be played on the 11th against St. Dominique but that game was postponed due to poor ice conditions. Instead, the Polar Bears scrambled to get an opponent for the weekend and managed to get the Portland Country Club to appear. Though they were able to play a game, the ice was still in sad shape and the teams were slow as a result. Miguel was credited with a good performance in goal despite allowing 4 goals on 26 shots but, again, the offense was unable to muster much in the way of scoring chances. The weather cooled down enough afterwards for the Whites to squeeze a home-and-home series with St. Dominique and split the matches. The Bears offense showed the first signs of life with a 2-goal output on the 16th, scoring both in the third period. Needham opened the next game with his second marker of the season just 9 seconds into the match. Unfortunately, that was the only offense the Bears could offer and St. Dominique methodically took over the game to have Bwdoin its thirs loss of the year.\nThe team took a few weeks off afterwards for the exam break but their return game with Bates ended up being cancelled due to a snowstorm. Instead, the Polar Bears met St. Dominique on February 9 and played probably their best game of the season. While Holmes was off the team after graduating, the team was buoyed by the return of Al Morrell, who had been absent since the first match, and the addition of Vic Whitman, who had played the year before. After the team found itself down by a pair in the second period, Morrell scored twice to tie the game then completed his hat-trick in the third. The Bears' lead was short-lived, however, and St. Dominique was able to force overtime. Just before the end of the 5-minute extra period, the winning goal was shot past Miguel and Bowdoin was down in the season series. The club didn't have long to lick its wounds and was back on the ice two days later. The lineup was reshuffled with Morrell dropping back to defense and, while that helped in their own end, it caused the offense to stall once more. Whitman snagged the only goal for the Bears who, despite a valiant effort, fell to Colby 1–2. The game was notable for being the first time that Bowdoin played with the defensemen playing side-by-side rather than single file.\nDrastically needing a spark, Miguel and Nichols swapped positions for the final game with St. Dominique. Nichols proved capable in goal, saving several scoring chances. The offense, however, was silent, getting just 3 shots on goal. Miguel and Nichols reverted to their normal position in the next game while Plaisted and Tracey joined the forward contingent. Their arrival coincided with the best offensive performance for the team as they notched their second win of the year. Because the rematch with Bates couldn't be rescheduled, Bowdoin ended its season with a trip to Waterville. Because the ice was soft, nether team could get much offense generated and the match ended in a draw.\nAfter the season, the cost of the program was tabulated and found to have cost the university $453.58. The majority of money spent was for equipment, some $200, while travel ($82) and accommodations for visiting teams ($67) were the other costly debits. The program had received $225 from the school and made $142 on gate receipts from home games. Other credits amounted to a total of $487.91 in funds, meaning that, at the end of the year, the team was able to return approximately $34 to the school treasurer.\nRichard Small served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 2024 Pro Bowl Games were the National Football League all-star game for the 2023 NFL season. This was the second year that the event consisted of skills competitions and a non-contact flag football game, rather than an actual tackle football game. The first block of skills competitions took place on February 1, 2024, around various venues in Central Florida, while the flag football game and the other events took place on February 4 at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida. Fan voting began on November 27, 2023, and ended on December 25. The rosters were then announced on January 3, 2024. The AFC dominated the flag football game 50–34 however they lost the game as the NFC was even more dominant in skills competitions 30–9, for a final score of 64 NFC, and 59 AFC, it was the highest scoring Pro Bowl game, beating the 2004 Pro Bowl score of 55 NFC, 52 AFC.\nBackground.\nThe NFL announced on July 25, 2023, that Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida would be the site for the game after spending the last two years at Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada.

On February 4, the remainder of the event program took place at Camping World Stadium.\nOn December 20, 2023, the league announced the skills competitions for both days, with a tug of war added to the program. The Closest to the Pin golf accuracy competition replaced the Longest Drive. The High Stakes event replaced the Lightning Round, reducing the previous year's three-part challenge to just the competition where players attempt to catch punts. In addition, the Madden NFL Head-to-Head event, in which two players from each conference play the Madden NFL video game using the Pro Bowl rosters, counted as part of the skill competitions instead of just being an exhibition event for the past few years.\nRosters.\nThe fan voting ran between November 27 and December 25, 2023. The final rosters were then announced on January 3, 2024.\nNFC.\n \nSchedule and results.\nThe first set of skills competitions were held on Thursday, February 1, 2024, at Nicholson Fieldhouse at the University of Central Florida.

J. Stroud and Baker Mayfield both advanced to the final round with the two highest scores in the opening round.\nBaker Mayfield won the event for the NFC with a score of 9.\nHigh Stakes.\nHigh Stakes was a multi-round competition in which players attempted to catch the most punts from a JUGS machine, without dropping other balls. This event replaced the Lightning Round completion from the previous year.\nMiles Killebrew won the event for the AFC after catching a punt while holding 5 other footballs (6 footballs total).\nClosest to the Pin.\nClosest to the Pin was a golf accuracy competition in which six players from each conference attempted to drive a golf ball to as close to the hole as possible (this event replaced the Longest Drive competition from the previous year). This was a pre-recorded segment held at the par-3, 18th hole of the Hawk's Landing Golf Course at the Orlando World Center Marriott Hotel.\nBryan Anger (NFC) won the event on his second attempt with a shot that landed 2 feet from the hole.\nSnap Shots.\nIn Snap Shots, long snappers and centers snapped balls at various targets with different sizes and point values.\nThe NFC won the event, scoring 14 points over the AFC's 10. Andrew DePaola led the NFC with 9 points.\nDodgeball.\nDodgeball was played by 4 teams of five players representing defensive and offensive selections from each conference. The event took place over two games that were both counted for points.\nThe AFC offense defeated the NFC defense in the first game, while the NFC offense defeated the AFC defense in the second game, earning three points for each conference.\nSunday.\nKick-Tac-Toe.\nEach team's kicker played a version of tic-tac-toe where they kicked balls towards a giant board. The AFC won the event \nFlag Football First Quarter.\nThe first quarter of the game was played.

The actual game was played live on Saturday, February 3, and streamed on YouTube and Twitch. Highlights were then shown during halftime of the flag football game, with the results being added to the overall game score. The NFC team of Puka Nacua (1H) and Micah Parsons (2H) of the NFC defeated David Njoku (1H) and Tyreek Hill (2H) of the AFC, 36–15.\nGridiron Gauntlet (race 1).\nSix players from each conference competed in a relay race through an obstacle course (two races were played). The first race was held during halftime after the Madden NFL score was added. The NFC won the race.\nBest Catch.\nIn Best Catch, Puka Nacua (NFC) and David Njoku (AFC), were shown in pre-recorded segments on Thursday doing special catches around various Orlando landmarks with Puka successfully catching a football thrown from a pier in a pond at Nona Adventure park while being towed behind a boat in waterskis in his second attempt and Njoku failing to catch a football thrown from a boat while performing a backflip dive off a rope swing into a pool at Evermore Orlando Resort across three attempts.

However, while the team was able to wear the school colors, they received precious little in terms of support from the college. The players lacked equipment, a home venue, a full time coach and funding of any kind. Worse, the team was also handicapped by the paucity of candidates for the team with most having never played the game before. Just 12 students attended the first workout for the club and, though prospects weren't great, the team was still able to enter itself into the competition for the Maine Intercollegiate Hockey Championship with Bates and Bowdoin. Freshman Richard Watson assumed the coaching responsibilities while Grenville Vale was elected team captain.\nOwing to their late start, the team played just one game in January. While they took their opening match, the haphazard play caused the team to redouble its training efforts for when they resumed after the exam break. They looked much more composed in their contest versus Maine, who were playing on an informal basis, and then extended their winning streak to 3 with a downing of the Polar Bears. Three difficult games at the end of the month not only put the state championship out of reach, but gave the distinct possibility that the Mules would finish with a losing record. The final match was played at home against Bowdoin, however, because of poor ice the game was ragged and slow. The two ended the match tied at 1-all and Colby was able to end its first season successfully with a mediocre record.\nC. Harry Edwards served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "Golf N' Stuff",
        "text": "Golf N' Stuff is an American brand of three family entertainment amusement parks and miniature golf courses located in the Southwestern United States cities of Norwalk, Ventura, and Tucson. It has a sister park in Phoenix, Castles N' Coasters. It has an estimated million visitors each year.\nHistory.\nThe first Golf N' Stuff was opened in Norwalk, in 1969. It was established in Ventura on August 10, 1974. The Golf N' Stuff in Tucson opened as Golf N' Things in 1976, with a medieval theme. After the company was bought in 1979, its name was changed to its current one.\nThe 29-year-old Timothy Roy broke the treehouse-sitting record at Golf N' Stuff Norwalk by sitting in a prebuilt treehouse in the park for 431 days, two hours, and thirty minutes between July 4, 1982, and September 8, 1983. The treehouse was above the ground and contained a sink and working toilet. Local restaurants provided the unemployed actor with food in the hope of publicity, and the many visitors also offered company and aid. The previous record, 182 days in 1978 by Glen Woodrich, was also set in the same treehouse.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, guests were required to constantly wear face masks, and half the arcade games were shut off. Staff were required to clean the games and restrooms hourly.\nAttractions.\nThe Norwalk location has four 18-hole miniature golf courses, with varying obstacles. There is no general theme throughout the park. Some holes contain alternate paths that may result in an automatic hole in one. It contains a Disk'O, go-karts, bumper boats, and a small train. It also contains an arcade with over 100 games and a snack bar, as no outside food is allowed. In Ventura, 80's music plays continuously, and there are only two courses. It still has go-karts, an arcade, and bumper boats, but also contains bumper cars. The Tucson location is the same, but instead of bumper cars, it has laser tag and batting cages. Birthday parties can be scheduled throughout all parks, and are popular there.\nIn popular culture.\nGolf N' Stuff's Norwalk location is known for being the site of both a scene in \"The Karate Kid\" and \"Cobra Kai\". \"Midnight Madness\", known for being the debut of Michael J. Fox, was filmed here, along with the music videos \"Shoots and Ladders\" by Korn, \"Girlfriend\" by Avril Lavigne, and \"Person of Interest\" by Rebecca Black.\nIn \"The Karate Kid\", the golf course is the site of Daniel LaRusso and Ali Mills' first date, while in \"Cobra Kai\", the season one episode \"All Valley,\" Miguel takes Sam to the course. While the scene in \"The Karate Kid\" was filmed onsite, the one in \"Cobra Kai\" was actually filmed in Fun Spot America – Atlanta, in Georgia."

The team was led by head coach Tony Bennett in his 15th year, and played their home games at John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville, Virginia, as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nThe Cavaliers started the season with four straight wins and earned themselves the twenty-fourth spot in the AP Rankings to start the season. They lost the opening game of the Fort Myers Tip-Off to Wisconsin and rebounded to defeat West Virginia in the third place game. The win wasn't enought to keep them in the rankings, as they fell out ahead of their ACC–SEC Challenge matchup with fourteenth ranked Texas A&amp;M. They won that match and two more matches to return to the rankings at number twenty-two. They went 1–1 as the 22nd ranked team, losing to twenty-third ranked Memphis before falling out again. The Cavaliers then lost three of their next four ACC games, with the lone win coming against struggling Louisville. A rivalry win over Virginia Tech sparked an eight game winning streak for the Cavaliers as they also defeated NC State in overtime and Clemson during the stretch. They again returned to the rankings at number twenty-one. They lost to Pittsburgh and won a low scoring game against Wake Forest before falling out of the rankings again. The Cavaliers finished out the season 2–3 losing a rivaly rematch to Virginia Tech and to North Carolina and Duke, who were both ranked tenth at the time of the matchup.\nThe Cavaliers finished the season 23–11 and 13–7 in ACC play to finish in third place. As the third seed in the ACC tournament, they earned a bye to the Quarterfinals where defeated third seed Boston College in overtime before losing to eventual champions NC State in overtime in the Semifinals. They earned a controversial at-large bid to the NCAA tournament and were placed as a tenth seed in the First Four in the Midwest region. They lost their matchup with Colorado State 42–67 to end their season. After the game, Virginia was widely criticized for its offensive performance, which included a stretch of nearly 14 minutes of game time and nearly an hour of real time during which they did not score.\nPrevious season.\nThe 2022–23 Cavaliers finished the season with an 25–8 record, 15–5 in ACC play, to finish in a tie for first place and clinch a share of their sixth regular season title in ten seasons, and their eleventh ACC regular season title in school history. They defeated North Carolina and Clemson to reach the championship game of the ACC tournament, where they lost to Duke.

        "text": "The 1926–27 Bowdoin Polar Bears men's ice hockey season was the 8th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nBowdoin had a difficult time getting on the ice prior to the first game and was forced to find other methods to get ready for the season. Coach Houser had invented a training regimen that mixed football, soccer and basketball called \"Houserball\" that the team used to keep in shape. The team lost several key members of last year's squad that it would find difficult to replace as three regulars from the freshman team (Rice, Howland and Clark) were ineligible until at least February.\nThe team opened with a practice game against the Westbrook Ramblers, hoping that the match would set them up for the beginning of the in-state series. However, due to the weakness of their opponent, Bowdoin didn't get much benefit out of the game. The Bears had their way with the Ramblers with goals from six different players. Sure enough, once the first game rolled around, the lack of practice and talent showed that the Polar Bears weren't up to their previous standard. Bowdoin was outplayed by Colby all game and were unable to withstand the physicality from the Mules, coming out on the short end of a 2–7 drubbing. Lord played a credible game in goal but he received little help from the defense. The Bears were better in their next game and played New Hampshire close until the Wildcats pulled away with a pair near the end of the game. Lord was again the best player for the team, making 29 saves in the match.\nThe Polar Bears played and exhibition match with Bates before heading south on a trip to Rhode Island. The Rhode Island Auditorium had opened the previous February and two college teams were immediately formed. Bowdoin earned a split against these inexperienced teams but the ice time did wonders for the Bears as they headed into the exam break. The team returned from the layoff with a rematch against Colby and played a much stronger game the second time around. The lineup had been rearranged in the interim with Cole and Walsh moving to wing while Thayer was shifted to center. Stone and Forsythe were now the starting defensive unit and they proved to be much more effecting in breaking up the Mules' attack. Playing on rough ice with snow falling around them, Bowdoin allowed just 1 goal to Colby at the very end of the game. The team was also buoyed by the first appearances of Howland, Parker and Dick Thayer's younger brother and the new arrivals helped carry the team to victory. The following day, Bowdoin travelled to play off the series and the two fought through another defensive slug fest with no goals in regulation. Bowdoin finally broke the tie in the second overtime and eliminated Colby from championship contention.\nThe Bates series began the following week and Bowdoin's defense was again the strength of the team. Dick Thayer demonstrates a quickness that the Bears were sorely in need of but it wasn't enough to stop the Bobcats from taking the game. A rematch was supposed to take place in Brunswick the following weekend, however, poor ice called the game to be cancelled and a return match was never held. The lone win by Bates was allowed to stand and enabled the Bobcats to win the state title.\nCalvin Hubbard served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "Tennis Cup",
        "text": "Tennis Cup is a 1990 tennis video game developed and published by Loriciel for the Amiga. It was ported to the Atari ST, MS-DOS and Amstrad CPC during the same year. \"Tennis Cup\" was ported to TurboGrafx-16 in 1991 as Davis Cup Tennis. Versions for the Super Nintendo (International Tennis Tour) and Mega Drive/Genesis (Davis Cup World Tour) were released in 1993.\nThe Amstrad version received a sequel, Tennis Cup 2, in 1990. A 16-bit sequel, also titled \"Tennis Cup 2\", was released in 1992 for the Amiga, Atari ST, and MS-DOS.\nGameplay.\n16-bit home computers.\nThe screen is split horizontally with both players seen from a behind the back viewpoint, even in single-player. The player is competing against 32 computer players, each with their own skills and weaknesses. You can adjust your skills at the beginning, with six basic types of shots to choose from: service, forehand, backhand, forehand volley, backhand volley, and smash. At first, each type has a 50% skill rating, but there are 30 percentage points to distribute. One type of shot can be weakened to strengthen another. New computer players can be created by adjusting the percentages and they can be saved to a disk. In practice mode, the player can play against a ball machine. There are four court types: clay, indoor, hard, or grass. There are five tournaments: Wimbledon, US Open, Australian Open, French Open, and Davis Cup. They can be entered individually, or in a marathon-style championship that links all five competitions together.\nUnlike the first game \"Tennis Cup 2\" can be played in full screen in single- or multiplayer. A new feature has been added to the game that allows for two human players to play a doubles match against a single computer opponent. According to \"Amiga Format\", \"Tennis Cup 2\" features \"better character animation and more user-friendly options\".\nSNES.\nThere are practice, exhibition, and career mode where the player is given a generous number of dollars and must compete on the world tennis circuit in order to gain more money. The player can only play as a male tennis player. During the exhibition mode, the rules can be altered along with the opponent.\nPlayers can either represent themselves in a singles tournament, a two-person team in a doubles tournament or their respective home country in a \"Nations Cup\" tournament It takes approximately 52 in-game weeks in order for a player in career mode to go from being the worst tennis player in the world to being the best tennis player in the world.\nPasswords are given out at the end of each match in order to players to continue their progress at a later date.\nReception.\nHome computers and PC Engine.\n\"Computer and Video Games\" concluded: \"What makes Tennis Cup so outstanding, though, is the presentation - apart from some niggly disk loading times, there's great scope for changing all the parameters from player statistics to the type, length and difficulty of a match\" \"The Games Machine\" noted that \"Playability is good but not exceptional.\" and recommended the game slightly over \"Pro Tennis Tour\". The Atari ST version was said to have better graphics and sound effects. It was called the best tennis game on the Atari ST along with \"International 3D Tennis\". \"Aktueller Software Markt\" said \"Tennis Cup\" is better than \"Pro Tennis Tour\" but worse than \"Tie Break\". They noted that the Atari ST version has better animation than the Amiga version. Comparing tennis games on the PC Engine, they recommended \"World Court Tennis\" and \"Final Match Tennis\" instead of \"Davis Cup\". \"\" said the screen size is insufficient, the animations are unimpressive, and the controls are sluggish.\n\"CU Amiga\" called \"Tennis Cup 2\" almost identical to the first game and recommended to get \"Advantage Tennis\" instead. \"Zero\" said \"it's very addictive at first, but play for a while and it can become really infuriating, crossing the thin line between addictiveness and frustration.\"\nMega Drive.\n\"Mean Machines Sega\" called the game \"[t]he best and surely the definitive and unquestionably grooviest tennis game for the Megadrive.\" One reviewer from \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" called the game \"[a] good, solid tennis game\", another one said \"[i]t doesn't have everything I'd like to see in a tennis game, but it's a worthwhile effort.\""

Top 20 paddlers from the qualification advance to the knockout phase plus the 12 next fastest paddlers from countries that have not qualified in the top 20. There are 8 heats in the first round of the knockout phase with the top 2 paddlers from each heat advancing to the next round. The same rules apply in quarterfinals and semifinals.\nPaddlers start their run by sliding off the starting platform several meters above the water. Then they must navigate the downstream and upstream gates. Unlike in classic slalom, paddlers are allowed to touch the gates and even intentionally move them with their paddle, but not with a free hand. There is also a designated zone where paddlers must perform an Eskimo roll.\nAthletes can be penalized in three ways in each round, by receiving a fault (FLT) or by being ranked as lower (RAL). Faults are incurred for false starts, missing gates or failing to correctly perform the Eskimo roll. Athletes are ranked as lower (RAL) if they breach the safety requirements of the competition, such as by holding back another athlete with their hands or paddle, deliberately paddling over another athlete's boat, or by making dangerous contact with another athlete's head or body - all other non-dangerous contact is allowed. In each round athletes are ranked first by the order in which they cross the finish line, with those incurring penalties ranked in the following order: FLT, RAL, DNF, .\nThe final classification of athletes is determined in the following manner: Athletes eliminated at any phase of the competition will be given their rank based on the comparison of the qualification times of athletes eliminated at the same phase. All 3rd ranked athletes will be ranked above all 4th ranked athletes. The final rank of athletes who did not progress to the heats is determined by their qualification results.\nResults.\nTime trials.\nTop 20 qualify automatically. The last 12 spots go to fastest paddlers from countries not yet qualified.\nKnockout rounds.\n&lt;br&gt;\nFinal ranking (top 32).\nThe top 32 ranking determined by the knockout rounds. Bib numbers correspond to seeding after time trials."

        "text": "The 2023–24 United Rugby Championship is the 23rd season of the professional rugby union competition known as the United Rugby Championship, and the third season under that name. It began on 21 October 2023 and will end on 22 June 2024. The reigning and defending champions are Munster Rugby who defeated Stormers in the 2023 final.\nFormat.\nThe season consists of 21 rounds: 18 rounds of regular season play, followed by three rounds of play-offs.\nThere are four regional pools: The Irish Shield pool (featuring the four Irish teams), the Welsh Shield pool (featuring the four Welsh teams), the South African Shield pool (featuring the four South African teams) and the Scottish/Italian 'Azzurri/Blue' Shield pool (featuring the two Italian and two Scottish sides). The pools serve two functions; they guarantee a full slate of derby matches for each team, and they award a minor Regional Shield trophy to the top team in each pool, which thereby functions as a national championship in three of the four pools, and a cross-border regional championship in the Scottish-Italian pool. They will no longer be used to determine qualification for the European Rugby Champions Cup. Instead, the top eight teams will qualify. \nThe winner of each Shield will be determined solely from the games played amongst the teams within their regional pool, mirroring the format of the old Interprovincial Championship in Ireland.\nTeams play six matches against their regional pool rivals home and away. The remaining twelve matches are made up by a single round robin, consisting of an even number of six home and six away matches against all the sides from the other pools. \nFor the Championship itself, there is one main league table. The top eight sides in the table will qualify for the quarter finals, followed by semi-finals and a grand final, with teams seeded 1 to 4 with home advantage for the lowest seeded side. The Regional Shield pools have no direct link to the play-offs and by extension the Championship itself, and it is technically possible to win a Regional Shield but not contest the play-offs, as the Welsh sides showed in 2022 and 2023.\nRegional Shield competitions.\nThis season, for the first time, regional shield standing were based entirely on performances against other teams within the same conference. Therefore, only six games for each team will count towards the regional shields.\nMatches.\nThe following are the match results for the 2023–24 United Rugby Championship regular season:\n \nKnockout stage.\nBracket.\nThe play-off draw is seeded based on final positions in the regular season league table.\nThe higher-ranked teams will have home advantage in the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final.\nLeading scorers.\nNote: Flags to the left of player names indicate national team as has been defined under World Rugby eligibility rules, or primary nationality for players who have not yet earned international senior caps. Players may hold one or more non-WR nationalities."

        "title": "1924–25 Bowdoin Polar Bears men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1924–25 Bowdoin Polar Bears men's ice hockey season was the 6th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAfter a difficult season in 1924, the school decided to bring in the first full-time coach for the program and baseball manager, \"Smiling\" Ben Houser, agreed to take over. Prospects for the season appeared to be good early on as a large number of students showed up to the first practice. With seven lettermen returning, the Bears weren't without experience and all the team needed was decent weather so they could get onto the ice. In the meantime, the program had also proven to be less costly than expected. The team had come in under budget in each of the previous four years with 1924 being the best. On an operating budget of $733.50, the hockey team had only cost $536.01 and returned nearly $200 to the treasurer. The team was not profitable by itself, as $447 of its funds came from the athletic department. Also, the receipts for home games contributed just $30 since students could attend the games for free.\nThe first game was on January 9 and, thankfully, the team was able to get on-ice practice in beforehand. Cutter and Cronin returned as starting forwards while Preble, who had been elected team captain dropped back to defense to take over for Miguel, last year's captain. Buckham returned to the A-team after finishing out last season with the reserves while Widen and Berry resumed their roles on defense and in goal respectively. While the team was largely unaltered, the changes in style made by Ben Houser turned a solid squad into a defensive force that was able to stand up to perennial state champion Bates. Cutter scored twice against the Garnet who were only able to summon up one score and Bowdoin started the season off with a win for the first time in its history. The team hit the road a few days later and had their pretentions checked by St. Dominique. The defense was far less effective and surrendered 5 goals before any of the forwards could respond. The end of the week saw the Bears finally meet an opponent from Massachusetts when they travelled to face Boston University. Not only was it the first time the team had travelled out of state but it was also the first indoor rink the Polar Bears had ever used. Perhaps awestruck by the sights and sounds or the raucous crowd, Bowdoin was slow off the mark and found themselves down by three less than 10 minutes into the game. The defense tihted up in the middle period but the offense couldn't get anything going against the Terriers. Cutter finally was able to get Bowdoin on the board in the third but a pair of subsequent goals from BU turned the game into a whitewash and the Bears returned home with several issues to address.\nAfter returning home, the team had a week to prepare for their next game and they used the opportunity to great effect. Bowdoin played possibly the best game in program history, looking like a well-oiled machine against Colby and completely dominated their in-state rivals 7–0. Even though they were slowed by poor ice, Cutter (4) and Buckham (3) combined to score every goal in about 18 minutes of game time. Coach Houser put the reserve forwards in for the latter half of the match and, though they failed to score, the Bears' defense made it impossible for the Mules to mount a comeback.\nThe team suspended play until after the exam break and were set to play MIT upon their return, however, the weather came into play once more. A thaw rendered their rink unusable and the match with the Engineers was cancelled. After terminating a rematch with Colby and postposing two others, the team was preparing itself for the possibility that no further games would be played. In the end, a total lack of ice ended the season for many teams in the region prematurely. Though Bowdoin had played just 4 matched, they were able to win their first state championship by defeating the other two active programs (Maine had suspended operations after last season).\nEmlyn Vose served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1920–21 Colgate men's ice hockey season was the 3rd season of play for the program. The team was coached by James Ballantine in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nIn early December, the athletic department announced that ice hockey would once more be supported as a varsity program. Colonel James Ballatine, who introduced lacrosse to Colgate the previous summer, agreed to be the first head coach in the history of the program. A schedule of 5 games was hastily arranged with Hamilton and Rensselaer each appearing twice. Due to the late nature of the announcement, the schedule was rearranged several times before any games were played.\nThe team used Taylor Lake for its home ice and practices, however, due to a warm winter they weren't able to get much training in before their first game. While RPI was scheduled to be their first opponent for the squad, they managed to shoehorn in a game with the Albany Country Club to try and get a bit of experience ahead of their intercollegiate schedule. The match was played on rough ice that slowed both teams down but did allow Colgate to put forth a solid defensive effort. The only goal was scored by Sanford after intercepting a pass and the Reds were able to get their first win in about 4 years. The extra workout seemed to be just what the team needed as they were able to roll over Rensselaer the following day. This time on good ice, the team was able to show its speed and outplayed the Engineers in both halves. The game is also noteworthy for being the first 6-on-6 game in program history.\nThe team sat on the sidelines until after the exam break and returned with an exhibition match with Hamilton. The Continentals were one of the best teams in college hockey that year and showed as much by shutting down the Colgate offense. The Reds, however, performed better than expected by limiting the visitors to a single goal and showed that they weren't to be taken lightly. An official game between the two took place a few days later but ended up with the same score. Shortly afterwards the academic results were announced. The team was stung by the loss of Sanford, Hurley and Pearsall who were now lost until they could regain their eligibility. The now-handicapped team travelled to face Cornell and play on a surface nearly double the size of the one they had at home. The completely remade offensive contingent was unable to score in the game, wasting a solid defensive effort due to a lack of familiarity.\nColgate had a few weeks before the final game of the season and that enabled Pearsall and Sanford to resolve their issues. Both were back in their regular positions for the final match but the team was completely swamped by Columbia. While Sanford was able to collect a hat-trick in the match the defense collapsed and surrendered 11 goals to the Lions. To add insult to injury, it was the first win for Columbia on the season and left the Reds with a losing record.\nGeorge E. Anderson served as team manager with Warner Chadwick as his assistant.\nNote: Colgate's athletic teams did not have a moniker until 'Red Raiders' was adopted in 1932.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "Olympic Esports Series",
        "text": "The Olympic Esports Series is an Olympic Games-style esports event, planned to be held annually, featuring multiple different virtual sports and video games coming together in a single location similar to a multi-sport event, run by the International Olympic Committee.\nWhile esports and competitive video gaming have traditionally not been considered a sport, the Olympic Movement began taking an interest as early as 2007, when esports was included at the 2007 Asian Indoor Games. In 2017, an Olympic Summit was held focused on the International Olympic Committee and esports. After an online-only Olympic Virtual Series was held during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 in five sports, the IOC eventually announced the creation of the Olympic Esports Series, as part of the Olympic Esports Week, in November 2022. The inaugural edition was held in Singapore in June 2023, with a second edition planned for 2024.\nThe events at the Olympic Esports Series have a connection with traditional Olympic sports, as the video game titles selected are chosen by international federations. There is a mix of both physical sport taking place in a virtual world, such as in Zwift, as well as sports-based video games such as \"Gran Turismo\". The lack of traditional esports titles at the Olympic Esports Series, and the inclusion of lesser-known games representing traditional Olympic sports, has been the subject of criticism.\nUnlike at the Olympic Games, medals and diplomas are not awarded at the Olympic Esports Series. The top three in each event are awarded gold-, silver-, and bronze-coloured trophies instead of medals.\nBackground.\nTraditional esports titles such as \"Counter-Strike\", \"Dota\", \"League of Legends\", and \"Valorant\" have been considered to be \"too violent\" for inclusion in an Olympic-style esports competition. An Olympic Summit was held in October 2017 to consider the possible adoption of esports by the Olympic Movement, with a further IOC Esports Forum held in July 2018. However, the lack of a single international federation to govern esports, a requirement for a sport to be recognised as an Olympic sport, along with the issue of violence in games, meant the IOC would not consider adding esports to the Olympic Games.\nOther sporting events, such as the Asian Games held by the Olympic Council of Asia and the Southeast Asian Games, recognise esports as a medal event. It was first added to a major Games at the 2007 Asian Indoor Games, and will become a full medal event of the Asian Games starting with the 2022 Asian Games held in 2023.\nAfter the COVID-19 pandemic led to the postponement of the 2020 Summer Olympics to 2021, the inaugural IOC-backed esports event, known as the Olympic Virtual Series, was announced for 2021. Sports included in that were baseball, cycling, motorsport, rowing, and sailing – four of which would return as part of the Olympic Esports Series in 2023.\nA second Olympic Virtual Series was planned for 2022, but did not take place, instead being replaced by the Olympic Esports Series.\nEvents and trophy winners of the 2021 Olympic Virtual Series.\nSource:\n2023 Olympic Esports Week.\nIn November 2022, the IOC announced that the inaugural Olympic Esports Week, set to be held in Singapore in June 2023, would include the in-person live finals of the 2023 Olympic Esports Series. The initial nine game titles and sports were announced on 1 March 2023, with a tenth event in shooting (\"Fortnite\") added on 5 May.\nThe first Olympic Esports Series finals were held in person from 23 to 25 June 2023 in Singapore at the Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre, as part of the inaugural Olympic Esports Week, which began a day earlier on 22 June with an opening ceremony.\nAt the opening ceremony, both IOC president Thomas Bach and the President of Singapore, Halimah Yacob, appeared remotely, with Halimah – who was on a state visit to Qatar at the time of the event – declaring the Olympic Esports Week open in her speech.\nSome 131 finalists took part in the Olympic Esports Week, which consisted of ten events in ten Olympic sports, while trophies were also awarded in an 11th event which had been held completely online. The sports involved were archery, baseball, chess, cycling, dance, motorsport, sailing, shooting, taekwondo, and tennis. The game chosen for each sport was put forward by each international sports federation in conjunction with the game's publisher, except for \"Fortnite\" in shooting where Epic Games disclaimed any involvement.\nEight Olympians competed in the taekwondo event: Wu Jingyu from China, who ended up winning bronze; Rohullah Nikpai of Afghanistan; Leonardo Basile (Italy); Aaron Cook (Great Britain and Moldova); Carmen Marton of Australia; Yasmina Aziez from France; Hwang Kyung-seon of South Korea; and Nur Tatar of Turkey.\nAdditionally, the chess event featured nine grandmasters and one female International Master: Aleksei Sarana, Maksim Chigaev, Nguyễn Ngọc Trường Sơn, Aleksandr Rakhmanov, Oleksandr Bortnyk, Samvel Ter-Sahakyan, Bassem Amin, Tin Jingyao, Kevin Goh, and Irene Kharisma Sukandar. This was the first IOC-sanctioned event at which Russian athletes – Chigaev and Rakhmanov – took part as \"individual neutral athletes\" (or AIN, from the French \"athlètes individuels neutres\"), as well as competing alongside a Ukrainian – Bortnyk, following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent suspension of the Russian Olympic Committee from the IOC.\nThe event reportedly drew 20,000 spectators to the Suntec Convention Centre over the four days.\nEvents and trophy winners (2023).\nSource:\nExhibition events.\nAs well as the ten events forming the Olympic Esports Series, the Olympic Esports Week in 2023 also included exhibition events in more traditional esports titles such as \"Rocket League\", \"Street Fighter 6\", and \"NBA 2K23\", as well as the sports-focused Arena Games Triathlon in a duathlon format as well as Virtual Table Tennis.\nThe \"Rocket League\" category featured two events: a men's show match between Karmine Corp and Gen.G and won by Karmine Corp, and a women's show match between G2 Luna and Williams Resolve, won by Resolve. \"Street Fighter 6\" was held as a four-player double-elimination tournament, and eventually won by Thailand's Thum Homchuen. That tournament also featured Hajime Taniguchi, aka Tokido, considered a legend in the Street Fighter esports scene. \"NBA 2K23\" was held as a single round-robin event with no official winner, and was contested by the national eFIBA teams of Philippines, Brazil, and Türkiye.\nCriticism.\nThe primary criticism when the Olympic Esports Series was announced was the IOC's choice of game titles, with only \"Gran Turismo\" and \"Just Dance\" having significant global recognition and \"Power Pros\" within Japan. The list of nine initial titles was described by \"Polygon\" as \"odd\", although the IOC's explanation was that the games chosen aligned with the Olympic Values and were proposed by international sports governing bodies.\nMany involved with the esports industry were unhappy with the game list, with \"The Guardian\" quoting a digital agency representative as saying: \"Last week’s announcement left us feeling disappointed and, honestly, a little embarrassed. Instead of working with existing game publishers or well-established tournaments, it seems that the Olympic committee has instead decided to use this event as a marketing vehicle for brand-new, poorly thought out, unlicensed mobile games.\" Gaming and esports website \"Dexerto\" reported on the online reaction, which saw esports fans responding negatively to the IOC's announcement on Twitter, describing the list of games as an \"out-of-touch lineup\". Some of the criticism, from Western fans, was also directed at the fact that many of the games selected were mobile titles.\nHowever, there was some acceptance from the esports community over the IOC's reasoning for its game selection, including from Global Esports Federation vice-president Chester King, the chief executive of British Esports, who called it \"a very sensible first approach\" because \"we've got to make sure all the stakeholders in the IOC accept it and like it\".\nAdditional criticism came after \"Fortnite\" was added to the game list for 2023, as the normal battle royale mode – featuring shooting at other characters – was removed in favour of a specially created format in which players would shoot targets instead. In a video segment, \"IGN\" called it \"the dumbest Olympic esport\".\nAfter the conclusion of the first event, the lack of participation from African players was criticised, with an opinion piece in Kenya's Daily Nation questioning the decision of the IOC to use online qualifiers for the Olympic Esports Series, due to connectivity and stability issues in Africa which make staying connected to servers a \"logistical challenge\".\nFuture.\nFollowing the conclusion of the inaugural event in Singapore, the IOC's head of virtual sports and esports Vincent Pereira said that Paris, as the host city of the 2024 Summer Olympics, had priority to host an edition of the Olympic Esports Series in 2024 if it wished, but that interest had also been received from Singapore to repeat as hosts as well as from Seoul, South Korea; Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates; New York City; and Shenzhen, China.\nDespite criticism over excluding traditional esports titles deemed \"too violent\", the IOC also intends to keep first-person shooter games out of the Olympic Esports Series in the future, according to Pereira. Despite \"Fortnite\" having been included in the 2023 event in a specially modified format with targets, Pereira added the default format of \"Fortnite\" involving shooting other characters would not be considered.\nFuture game additions could include \"Rocket League\", the \"Street Fighter\" series, and the \"NBA 2K\" series, which all featured as exhibition events in 2023.\nHowever, the inclusion of esports as a sport at the main Olympic Games is not likely in the immediate future, despite it having medal status at the Asian Games and Southeast Asian Games, as well as various esports World Championships being held for traditional sports, such as the Esailing World Championship, with the IOC's Pereira saying \"they're two different worlds\"."

        "text": "The 1928–29 Williams Ephs men's ice hockey season was the 26th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nJust before the team was called to the first meeting, coach Bellerose met with representatives of the other Intercollegiate Ice Hockey Association of America members in New York City. Several topics were discussed, chief among which was the addition of Pennsylvania to the league, bringing up the total membership to 10 (the other schools were Boston College, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Hamilton, Harvard, Princeton and Yale). The Association announced that the western teams were largely following the rules set out by the eastern counterparts and that Spalding would soon publish a handbook containing the rules adopted by their members. The Association made one rule change; referees were to now refrain from stopping play to call a penalty on a defending team if the attacking team was in the process of attempting to score. The committee decided that an attacking team should not be deprived of a scoring opportunity in the event of a foul from their opponent. They also decided that, in the event that a goal was not scored, the ensuing faceoff should take place at the defender's blue line. The final decision by the Association was to submit a proposal that in future Olympic years, the highest ranking college team be used as the American representative. To forestall objections to this plan, a second suggestion was put forth that a committee be organized to instead select the members of an All-American team from the various programs.\nOnce the team convened, the Ephs found the weather to be much more accommodating than in recent years. A colder winter helped to freeze the campus ponds and the team was able to work through several training sessions on Cole Field Pond. The extended training time allowed the team to fill in several gaps of now-graduated players. team captain Dunton Howe was paired with Ben Langmaid, who had played last year on the freshman team. Watters was promoted to starting goaltender after serving as a backup and had a pair of men battling to become his understudy. The forward contingent was in flux as prospective starting winger Wheeler was nursing a knee injury. Brigham, the nominal center, was moved to right wing with Nye slotting in at the pivot position while they waited for Wheeler's return. A good many alternates were available for Williams and, because of the team's increasing prominence, 15 men were allowed to make the annual trip to Lake Placid. Just before their trip, the weather took a turn and warmed up. The team was unable to follow up their early practice before the trip but still felt good about their chances against Amherst.\nThe team arrived on the 27th and were able to get in two solid days of practice before their opening game. The Ephs got off to a quick start and netted four goals in the first period with Howe and Langmaid combining for 3 scores. the Sabrinas stages a late comeback but were unable to overcome the sizable lead and Williams took the opening round. The second game was marred by poor ice and an overconfidence on the part of Williams. The Ephs got the lead in the first, however, this time they were only able to get a single goal. When Amherst stages their surge in the second, they had a much easier time surmounting the Purple and tied the series with a close victory. The deciding game of the series was held on New Year's Day and, once again, the starting defensemen led off the scoring with the first two goals. The offense joined the party in the second and Williams built another 4-goal edge. Amherst was unable to keep pace and could only earn a single marker, allowing Williams to take the series and return home victorious.\nBack in Williamstown, the team found that the weather had cooled off once more and they were able to get several days of practice in before they headed off to take on Army. By then, Wheeler had recovered from his ailment and was back with the team. The full contingent of Ephs rolled over the Cadets, scoring 10 goals to Army's 0 and looked every bit the team that could vie for a championship. Brigham and Langmaid each recorded hat-tricks while Watters and Sholes shared the shutout. The next match saw Williams battle in a close match with an undermanned Union team for over two periods. The Ephs were a bit slow out of the gate and managed just 1 goal in the first 40 minutes, a feat equaled by the Dutchmen. The offense came alive in the third, however and Brigham's hat-trick paced the Purple to a comfortable margin for their fourth win of the season.\nWilliams was next supposed to renew their season series with Amherst on the 19th but that game was postponed due to inclement weather. Instead, the Ephs faced down Massachusetts Agricultural a few days later and got into a defensive struggle. Coach Bellerose referred to the Aggies as a \"Basketball team on skates\" due to their peculiar though effective 5-man defense. Williams was held in check all afternoon except on one occasion when Brigham was able to get on a break and score the only goal of the game. With Williams climbing up the rankings, the team welcomed Cornell to Williamstown but found themselves unable to break through another stout defensive unit. Cornell opened the scoring in the first and fought hard to keep their advantage. The Ephs increased the pressure in the final period but could not slip the puck past the Red goaltender and fell 0–1.\nWilliams had to stew in that loss over the exam break and seemed reinvigorated when they went south to take on Pennsylvania. The Quakers were unable to withstand the Williams attack and even after the second offensive unit had been subbed in, the Purple were still able to find the back of the net. Howe was the leader for the night with 3 goals. The following night the team resumed its annual contest with Princeton and gave the Tigers a tough fight through two periods. Williams surrendered 2 goals in the opening 5 minutes of the game but then settled down defensively and kept pace with Princeton for the next 40 minutes. Brigham had had several scoring opportunities in that stretch but was unable to capitalize on any of them. Over the final 15 minutes, apparently tired of such a close game, the Tigers scored 4 goals in quick succession to build an insurmountable lead over Williams. Brigham did finally get the Purple on the board but it was too little too late and the Ephs returned home after a road split.\nThe earlier match with Amherst finally took place a few days later as the two teams heading in different directions. Williams had been treading water and was hampered by a lack of practice time while Amherst was riding a 4-game winning streak and were looking for revenge after the early-season defeats. Howe and Langmaid turned in stellar performances with each recording a goal and then holding off the Lord Jeffs in the later half of the game. Despite a furious comeback attempt, Amherst was only able to score once and Williams remained the better of the two. Perhaps just as important, Williams was now 7–0 in Little Three matches with Amherst, not having dropped any of the regular football, soccer or ice hockey games between the two. A rematch between the two was supposed to take place on the 19th but had to be delayed until after the match with Middlebury. The Panthers brought a physical game with them and tried to impose their will on the Ephs. The northerners managed to build a 2-goal lead at the start of the third but scored by Hoyt and Brigham just 2 minutes apart tied the match. Overtime was needed to settle the account and Middlebury pulled ahead on a goal from Kelley. Despite their best efforts, Williams was unable to tie the game a second time. The final match with Amherst saw Williams' offense continue to struggle with Brigham getting the Ephs' only goal just 3 minutes into the game. Snowfall hampered both teams and the physical play increased. There was a fairly consistent parade of players to the penalty box but neither was able to convert on any of the opportunities and the rest of the game went by without another goal. Amherst tried to assail the Williams cage in the final 10 minutes, once the floodlights were turned on, but the defense held and sent Amherst packing for the fourth time that year.\nWilliams ended the season with a rematch against Princeton. In the Tigers' first trip to Williamstown, the two fought a mostly clean game that still possessed an edge. Many players were sent to the ice throughout the contest but only two penalties were called for illegal plays. Williams' forwards were unable to get much going in the game so it was left up to the defense to score. After Princeton's two goals in the first, Schwartz, playing in just his second game of the season, cut the lead in half in the middle frame. Early in the second, Howe, who was playing in his final game for Williams, tied the match and gave hope that the team would be able to get one over on the visiting Orange. Unfortunately, Princeton was able to regain their lead with just 4 minutes remaining thanks to the sun shining in Watters' eyes. The team valiantly tried to score but a tripping call to Langmaid curtailed the comeback attempt and Williams went down in defeat.\nAndrew Williamson served as team manager with Edward Reeves as his assistant.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1927–28 Williams Ephs men's ice hockey season was the 25th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAs the team lost just one player to graduation (Leonard Smith), and had their coach returning for a second season, Williams entered the season with high expectations. As they had in each of the previous three seasons, Williams was going to begin the season in Lake Placid. With this in mind, the team held their first meeting after Thanksgiving to prepare for the upcoming season. The early start meant that the Ephs had no ice available at the time, however, while that unwelcome news was a common occurrence for the team, another issue was very surprising. McGill had started putting together an international coalition of colleges that included the likes of Toronto, Princeton and Yale with the intention of forming a conference. What might have come as a shock was that Williams, despite being a small college, was invited to join the potential league as well. The Ephs were rather flattered to receive the invitation but thought that their inclusion may have been premature as the team still did not possess a permanent home rink. Furthering the increase in prominence for the program was the debate in early December as to whether the hockey and basketball teams would be promoted to 'major' status within the athletic department. While no definitive decision was reached, the prospect of building an enclosed arena for the team was brought up as a distinct possibility.\nWhile the overall condition of the program was being debated, the team was suffering through another too-warm winter. The lack of ice made training very difficult and the team had precious little time together before they headed to upstate New York. 13 players made the trip for the 3-game series with Dartmouth. Unfortunately, after just one day of skiing, all athletic events were cancelled due to poor weather conditions. The team was then expecting to play its first game at home against Middlebury on January 11, however, the weather prevented both that and a subsequent game against Massachusetts Agricultural from taking place and the Ephs weren't able to play its first match until the 18th.\nWhile the team waited for its first game, they had to consign themselves to practicing in the gymnasium. While they were able to stay in shape, the team had no ability to work on their skating or teamwork which, as past years had proven, were vital for the success of the Ephs. When they were finally able to play their first match, the game at Amherst had to be played on one of the temporary rinks on Massachusetts Agricultural's football field. The ice was soft, choppy and covered in puddles. The barely-usable surface rendered the game a slow slog with both teams also suffering from little practice time. The only goal of the game came off of a shot from center ice that ricocheted off of a Williams player into the Purple net. Despite the issues, the game saw decent performances from the top line of Hoyt, Blaney and Smith.\nDue to poor weather in New York, the next game was moved from Schenectady to Williamstown. Williams returned home and mercifully found that the ice on Sage Hall Rink was solid. Due to the game's late start, the final period, which lasted just 5 minutes, was played under the floodlights. With all of those changes the Ephs were able to secure their first win of the season. Hutchins turned aside a bevy of chances early in the game while Howe and Shepler found their skating legs. Brigham, who had replaced Hoyt as the starting left wing, opened the scoring near the end of the first and Williams gradually took over the game afterwards. Despite having two goals waved off in the later stages, the three Purple goals were more than enough to earn a win. With their next match being the final one before the exam break, Williams rounded out a difficult first half of their season with a 3–2 win over YMCA College. Williams was able to jump out to a 3–0 lead with a dominating style in the first two periods. The entire team was substituted in the third period which, on an account of darkness, was limited to just 10 minutes. Luckily, that curtailed the comeback from the Garnet as reserve netminder Watters allowed two goals in the final frame but the b-team was able to prevent the tying goal from being scored.\nThe team was supposed to play its rematch with Amherst on February 8, however, rain forced that contest to be postponed until after the team returned from its trip west. The time off appeared to work wonder on the Ephs as Williams was easily the better team in both games of their trip. Blaney, Hoyt and Smith each scored 2 goals against Cornell despite soft ice and the team overwhelmed the Big Red in the first and third periods. The following evening, Williams had a much tougher challenge from Hamilton but another pair of marker from Blaney led the team to victory.\nWilliams travelled south for their biggest test of the season and had high hopes for the match versus Princeton. Unfortunately, the Tigers put up their best performance of the season and handed Williams a convincing 1–5 defeat. While they were playing on the best ice they had seen all season, Williams had grown accustomed to rough or soft ice and were unprepared for the different circumstances. A lack of practice time ahead of the match didn't help either. While the multitude of substitutes used by the Ephs helped the Purple stave off exhaustion in the 60-minute match, the offense and defense, degraded by the absences of Smith and Shepler respectively, were unable to withstand the Princeton attack.\nWith the season coming to a close, the second Amherst game was finally staged but neither team appeared ready for the match. The game was described as both listless and disorganized though Williams was visibly the better of the two. In a reversal of the earlier match, Blaney scored in the third to provide the only marker as the Ephs avenged the season-opening loss. The following evening, the team showed a far superior effort and overpowered Army in the season finale. Howe's first goal of the season opened the scoring and the Purple never looked back, keeping the Cadets hemmed in their own end for most of the game. The victory capped off a rather successful season for the Ephs despite being curtailed by the weather.\nWilliam Eaton served as team manager with Andrew Williamson as his assistant.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "1919–20 Bowdoin Polar Bears men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1919–20 Bowdoin Polar Bears men's ice hockey season was the inaugural season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nWith college hockey now out of the shadow of World War I, Bowdoin fielded its first official ice hockey team. The school allowed a rink to be built on campus between Hubbard and Hyde Halls for the club and hoped to be able to put together a schedule that included other Maine schools. Due to the area available, the dimensions of the rink were 125' by 52'. This was far smaller than the modern rink size of 200' by 85', however, it was not uncommon at the time for colleges to use smaller skating surfaces. A bigger surprise came soon after construction of the rink commenced when the athletic council announced that ice hockey would immediately become a 'major' sport. Hockey had only been informally played at the school prior to the war but the athletic council decided to make the change in the light of other local schools, particularly Bates, Colby and Maine, progressing towards programs of their own.\nPage, the team's manager, conducted practice while trying to put a slate of games together but he was finding it difficult to secure meetings on such short notice. The team was supposed to play its first official game on January 17 against the Canadian Club of Portland but poor weather forced the match to be cancelled. However, a few days later, Bowdoin travelled to Lewiston and faced off against Bates in the program's debut. In front of a crowd of about 300, Bowdoin went down to defeat but acquitted themselves well. Morrell scored the program's first goal while Page played well in the match. Three days later the Whites earned their first win when they downed the Portland Country Club 6–4. While not employing a rover, as they had done in the first game, the offense seemed much more cohesive. Morrell nabbed the first hat-trick in program history and captured the laurels for the game along with Page. There was hope that the team could continue its strong play in the rematch with Bates and, while the offense did play better, the defense was not able to pull its own weight. The Garnet scored 9 goals in the game, with Provost recording a double hat-trick, and were just too much for Bowdoin to overcome. Morrell netter a pair of goals to continue his strong season but it wasn't nearly enough to keep pace with Bates.\nThe team took a break afterwards for the exam session and didn't play their next match until mid-February. Upon their return they faced the Portland Country Club in a rematch but hadn't solved any of their defensive problems. Despite scoring 5 goals, they surrendered 9 in the match and lost in another sloppy effort. After two bad losses, the team made several changes to the lineup. Richardson replaced Doherty in goal while Morrell was dropped back to cover point, swapping spots with Curtis. The changes brought about a far superior defensive effort from the Whites when Bowdoin took on Bates and, though they lost the match, they only surrendered a single goal to the Garnet. The final game, the fourth of the season against Bates, took place the following evening and Bowdoin was finally able to get one over on their in-state rivals. Curtis scored his only goal of the season to lead the team to a 1–0 victory. Richardson was in goal for the program's first shutout.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\nScoring statistics.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 2024 PDC World Darts Championship (known for sponsorship reasons as the 2023/24 Paddy Power World Darts Championship) was a professional darts event that took place at Alexandra Palace in London, England, from 15 December 2023 to 3 January 2024. It was the 31st World Darts Championship to be organised by the Professional Darts Corporation.\nMichael Smith was the defending champion, having defeated Michael van Gerwen 7–4 in the 2023 final. However, Smith lost 4–0 to Chris Dobey in the fourth round. For the first time since the 2006 event, all four semi-finalists (Rob Cross, Luke Humphries, Luke Littler and Scott Williams) were English. For the first time since the 2010 event, two unseeded players (Littler and Williams) reached the final four.\nThe third seed Luke Humphries won his first World Championship title, defeating 16-year-old debutant Luke Littler 7–4 in the final. He also became world number 1 for the first time in his career. The event sponsor pledged to donate £1,000 to the charity Prostate Cancer UK for every 180 scored during the tournament. The tournament set a new record for the most 180s achieved (914), raising £914,000 for the charity, which was ultimately rounded to £1,000,000. Humphries scored the most 180s at the event (73), winning the inaugural \"Ballon d'Art\" trophy for the achievement.\nSteve Beaton made a record-extending 33rd consecutive World Championship appearance, but lost in the second round to Daryl Gurney. After 28 years with the PDC, referee Russ Bray retired at the end of the tournament after officiating his last televised ranking match at the world final.\nOverview.\nThe 2024 PDC World Darts Championship was the 31st World Darts Championship organised by the Professional Darts Corporation, and the 17th to be held at Alexandra Palace, London. It took place from 15 December 2023 to 3 January 2024 as the culminating event of the 2023 Professional Darts Corporation season. The championship featured 96 players, with the top 32 highest ranked players on the PDC Order of Merit seeded through to the second round. Players ranked 33rd to 64th on the Order of Merit, and 32 other players from various qualifiers, started in the first round.\nFollowing the withdrawal of previous title sponsor Cazoo in July 2023, bookmaker Paddy Power agreed a three-year deal to sponsor the event. As part of its promotion of the event, Paddy Power announced that the triple 20 would be changed from its traditional red to green, although this would later be revealed to be a hoax to raise awareness of the \"Big 180\" campaign, for which the bookmaker would donate £1,000 to charity Prostate Cancer UK for every maximum score of 180 achieved during the tournament. Additionally, the Irish betting provider inaugurated the \"Ballon d'Art\" for the player who achieved the most maximum scores throughout the event.\nGoing into the event, Luke Humphries was viewed by players and bookmakers as the tournament favourite, having won three majors since October—the World Grand Prix, the Grand Slam of Darts, and the Players Championship Finals. Sky Sports pundit Wayne Mardle backed Humphries to win the event, describing him as \"the best player on the planet\", while former player Paul Nicholson described him as \"a world number one in waiting\".\nDefending champion Michael Smith was seen as unlikely to defend his title after a disappointing season, especially since he changed his darts supplier during the summer. Smith himself acknowledged he was a likely target for players to up their game and eliminate him. Going into the event, Smith began practicing with Nathan Aspinall in an effort to rectify his lack of practice throughout the year, which he attributed to a busier lifestyle following his championship win.\nFormat.\nAll matches were played as straight in, double out, requiring the players to score 501 points to win a leg, finishing on a double. The matches were played in the set format, with a minimum of three sets required to win a match. The following rules were observed:\nRanking.\nRankings in the PDC Order of Merit are calculated on a two-year basis. Most of the players were defending their PDC Order of Merit prize money from the 2022 PDC World Darts Championship. At the end of the tournament, the PDC Order of Merit prize money from that event was deleted from their rankings. After the tournament, the top 64 in the PDC Order of Merit received a one-year extension on their tour card. The players in the final year of their tour card who finished the tournament outside the top 64 lost their tour card, unless players inside the top 64 resigned their tour card.\nPrize money.\nThe total prize pool for the tournament remained at £2.5 million in total for the sixth year in a row.\nQualification.\nSeeding.\nThe previous year's winner Michael Smith was top of the two-year PDC Order of Merit and number one seed going into the tournament. Michael van Gerwen, the three-time World Champion from 2014, 2017 and 2019, was the second seed, having won two major titles in 2023, the Premier League and the World Series of Darts Finals. Luke Humphries, winner of three of the last four ranked premier events in 2023, the World Grand Prix, Grand Slam and the Players Championship Finals, was the third seed. The 2022 world champion Peter Wright, who was also champion in 2020 and won the 2023 European Championship, was the fourth seed. As well as Smith, van Gerwen and Wright, four other previous PDC world champions qualified as seeds: 2021 world champion Gerwyn Price was the 5th seed, 2018 world champion Rob Cross was the 8th seed, 2015 and 2016 world champion Gary Anderson was seeded 21st, and 2007 world champion Raymond van Barneveld was seeded 29th. 2014 BDO World Champion Stephen Bunting qualified as 18th seed. He was one of two former BDO champions to qualify as seeds, alongside four-time BDO champion van Barneveld.\nThe top seeds behind Smith, van Gerwen, Humphries, Wright and Price were 2023 World Matchplay champion Nathan Aspinall, 2022 UK Open champion Danny Noppert, Rob Cross, and Jonny Clayton, who, alongside Gerwyn Price, won the 2023 PDC World Cup of Darts. Other 2023 major event champions to qualify as seeds were Masters champion Chris Dobey at 17th, with 2023 UK Open winner Andrew Gilding three places below him at 20th.\nPro Tour qualification.\nRicardo Pietreczko, the winner of the 2023 German Darts Championship, was the highest-ranked non-seed on the 2023 PDC Pro Tour Order of Merit in his first World Championship participation. Gian van Veen, the 2023 World Youth runner up and a European Championship semi-finalist, and 2023 ProTour event winners Ryan Joyce and Radek Szagański were also amongst the qualifiers.\nAs well as Pietreczko, Van Veen and Szagański, other players qualifying for their PDC World Championship debuts were Mario Vandenbogaerde, Richard Veenstra, Kevin Doets, Connor Scutt, Dylan Slevin, Lee Evans, Jules van Dongen. Other players qualifying via the Pro Tour included 2010 runner-up Simon Whitlock, 1996 BDO champion Steve Beaton, and the 2012 BDO champion Christian Kist. Beaton qualified for a record-extending 33rd consecutive World Championship appearance.\nInternational qualifiers.\nThe final group of 32 qualifiers were determined by a series of international qualifiers and secondary tours. The PDC Asian Tour was held for the first time since 2019, and provided qualifiers for both the World Championship and the Asian Championship; the Professional Darts Japan qualifier was replaced with a place via the Asian Championship being reserved for a Japanese player. The Ukrainian qualifier that had been held for the first time in qualification for the previous year was discontinued, and the South West and West Europe qualifiers were combined.\nLuke Littler, the 2023 World Youth Champion, qualified via the PDC Development Tour. Fallon Sherrock, the only woman to have previously won a match at the PDC World Darts Championship, and two-time BDO Women's World Champion Mikuru Suzuki qualified via the PDC Women's Series. In a rule change, the PDC announced that no player was eligible to compete in the 2024 PDC World Championship had they played at the 2023 WDF World Darts Championship which concluded a week earlier. Beau Greaves, the winner of the 2023 Women's World Matchplay, chose not to compete in the PDC Championship for which she had qualified, instead opting for the WDF. Prakash Jiwa, the winner of the Indian Qualifier, was suspended by the Darts Regulation Authority on 16 November 2023 while an investigation is conducted into suspicious betting in the independent Modus Super Series. Jiwa was replaced by the runner-up of the Indian Qualifier, Bhav Patel on 25 November 2023. The final four places were awarded by a qualifier for non-qualified PDC Tour Card holders.\nDebutants via the international and invitation qualifiers were Simon Adams, Owen Bates, Stowe Buntz, Tomoya Goto, Man Lok Leung, Luke Littler, Wessel Nijman, Sandro Eric Sosing, Bhav Patel, Berry van Peer, Darren Penhall, Reynaldo Rivera, Alex Spellman and Thibault Tricole, who was the first ever player from France to qualify for a PDC World Championship.\nList of qualifiers.\nOrder of Merit\"Second round (seeded)\"\n \"(fourth round)\"\n \"(quarter-finals)\"\n (champion)\n \"(second round)\"\n \"(third round)\" \n \"(second round)\"\n \"(second round)\"\n \"(semi-finals)\"\n \"(fourth round)\"\n \"(fourth round)\"\n \"(quarter-finals)\"\n \"(second round)\"\n \"(second round)\"\n \"(fourth round)\"\n \"(second round)\"\n \"(third round)\"\n \"(quarter-finals)\"\n \"(fourth round)\"\n \"(third round)\"\n \"(second round)\"\n \"(fourth round)\"\n \"(third round)\"\n \"(second round)\"\n \"(third round)\"\n \"(second round)\"\n \"(third round)\"\n \"(fourth round)\"\n \"(quarter-finals)\"\n \"(second round)\"\n \"(second round)\"\n \"(third round)\"\nPro Tour Order of Merit\"First round\"\nInternational Qualifiers\"First round\"\nSummary.\nOpening rounds.\nThe tournament began on 15 December, with defending champion Michael Smith avoiding a shock on the opening night at the hands of Dutch qualifier Kevin Doets, winning 3–2. James Wade was the first seeded player eliminated from the tournament, losing 3–2 to Canadian Matt Campbell. Fourth seed and former two-time champion Peter Wright suffered a 3–0 defeat to Jim Williams, who had whitewashed Guyanan Norman Madhoo in his opening match.\n16 year old Luke Littler made history by averaging 106.2 in a 3–0 win against Dutchman Christian Kist, the highest ever achieved by a débutant at the event, and followed this by defeating 2023 UK Open champion Andrew Gilding 3–1 in the second round. 2023 World Matchplay champion Nathan Aspinall also suffered a 3–0 defeat, being eliminated by \"Rapid\" Ricky Evans.\nIn total, 11 seeds were eliminated in the second round; in addition to Wade, Wright, Gilding, and Aspinall, Danny Noppert, Dirk van Duijvenbode, Dimitri van den Bergh, Josh Rock, Jose de Sousa, Callan Rydz and Kim Huybrechts all lost their first game.\nThibault Tricole became the first French player to win a game at the PDC World Championship, defeating Belgian Mario Vandenbogaerde 3–1, before being eliminated in round two by 2018 world champion Rob Cross.\nThird round.\nFormer world champion Gerwyn Price was the highest ranked player to be eliminated in the third round, going down 4–2 to Brendan Dolan. Two unseeded players made it through to the fourth round, 16-year old Luke Littler continuing his debut run with a 4–1 victory over Matt Campbell and Scott Williams defeated Martin Schindler in a match which went all seven sets.\nLuke Humphries, one of the pre-tournament favourites, survived a scare against Ricardo Pietreczko, rallying from 3–1 down to triumph 4–3. Damon Heta also beat Berry van Peer in another game to go the distance, while world champion Michael Smith and former champions Michael van Gerwen, Rob Cross, Gary Anderson and Raymond van Barneveld all continued their attempts to win the tournament for another time.\nFourth round.\nReigning champion Michael Smith's campaign to retain his title ended in the fourth round, being beaten 4–0 by Chris Dobey. Gary Anderson was also eliminated 4–3 by Brendan Dolan, while Raymond van Barneveld was knocked out 4–1 by Luke Littler, in a match that attracted considerable attention, with BBC Sport unusually running a liveblog of the match and highlighting the fact that Littler had not been born the previous occasion that Van Barneveld had won the World Championship.\nLittler's fellow unseeded player Scott Williams also made the quarter-finals, eliminating Damon Heta. Luke Humphries again had to battle, going all the way to a sudden-death final leg against Joe Cullen before breaking his opponent's throw and keeping his Championship hopes alive. Rob Cross reached the quarter-final for the first time since his 2018 triumph with a 4–0 victory over Jonny Clayton, and Michael van Gerwen also had a 4–0 win over Stephen Bunting. Dave Chisnall completed the quarter-final lineup with victory over Daryl Gurney.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were held on New Year's Day. The first to be played was between Rob Cross and Chris Dobey. Dobey took the first set against the throw and made a dominant start, going up 4–0. Cross fought back and held the next set, before breaking the Dobey throw to pull back to 4–2. The last leg of the seventh set saw Dobey miss one dart at bullseye to win the match before Cross took the set and again broke the Dobey throw to level the match. Cross won the first two legs of the final set to take the lead for the first time in the match before Dobey took the next two to bring the match into extra legs. Cross won the seventh leg in ten darts and took advantage of a missed dart by Dobey to break in the eighth set and win the match, qualifying for the semi-final for the second time in his career.\nThe second game was between Brendan Dolan and Luke Littler. Littler won the first set despite Dolan taking a 2–0 lead, before breaking throw in the second set to take control of the match. Littler won the next two sets to solidify his lead. Despite Dolan breaking back in the fifth set 3–1, Littler took all three legs in the sixth set to secure the victory and continue his debut run. The result confirmed that Littler would finish the tournament in the top 64 of the PDC Order of Merit, meaning he would carry his ranking money into the next season and meaning his previously secured two-year tour card was instead given to Nathan Rafferty. Littler was the first debutant to reach the semi-final since Nathan Aspinall at the 2019 tournament.\nIn the third quarter-final between Michael van Gerwen and Scott Williams, the first two sets went with throw before van Gerwen broke in the third set after Williams missed five darts at doubles to win the set. Williams however won the next six legs in a row to reverse the set lead to 3–2. Van Gerwen re-established himself in the match by winning the next set 3–0 but Williams won the seventh set to go one away. Williams again broke throw in the third leg of the eighth set and held the advantage to eliminate the three-time world champion and qualify for the first semi-final of his career. He and Littler were the first semi-finalists to have been unseeded going into the tournament since Aspinall in 2019.\nThe final quarter-final was between Luke Humphries and Dave Chisnall. The first three sets went with throw but in the fourth set, after Chisnall took the first two legs to seemingly maintain the pattern, he missed two darts to hold the set and Humphries turned it around to get the match's first set break. Humphries held throw in the fifth set and then broke again in the sixth set to secure a 5–1 victory and qualify for his first World Championship semi-final.\nSemi-finals.\nIn the first semi-final, Rob Cross played Luke Littler. Cross had throw in the first set and won it, before breaking in the third leg of the second set. Cross, however, missed one set dart in the next leg and Littler was able to come back and win the set, before breaking in the first leg of the third set, which he went on to win. Littler again held throw in the fourth set and missed one dart to take the fifth set, which Cross won. Littler took the sixth set and then broke Cross in the third leg of the seventh set to go one away. The eighth set went the distance, before Littler took out a finish of 80 to complete a 6–2 victory and qualify for the final. Littler was the first debutant to reach a final since Cross himself in 2018, and the first unseeded player to do so since Kirk Shepherd in 2008.\nIn the second semi-final, Scott Williams played Luke Humphries. Williams broke the Humphries throw in the first leg of the first set, but Humphries broke straight back in the next leg and was able to hold the first set. He broke the Williams throw twice in the second set to take it 3–0 before completing the highest possible 170 finish in the first leg of the third set, taking the set after Williams had missed a dart at the bullseye to break. Humphries extended his lead further after breaking throw in the final leg of the fourth set, before taking the fifth set 3–0. Humphries broke again in the third leg of the sixth set and took out a 20 finish in the next leg to wrap up a 6–0 sets victory and qualify for his first World Championship final and his fourth final in the last five PDC premier ranked events. The result confirmed that Humphries would, for the first time, move to number one on the PDC Order of Merit following the tournament.\nFinal.\nThe final between Luke Littler and Luke Humphries was held on 3 January 2024. It was the final World Championship game for referee Russ Bray, who announced his intention to retire from refereeing ranked events prior to the tournament. Prior to the match, Bray was inducted into the PDC Hall of Fame.\nLittler had the throw at the start of the first set; but lost the throw to Humphries in the third leg, who won the set 3–1. Humphries broke the Littler throw again in the second leg of the second set, but Littler broke back in the third set after Humphries missed a dart for the set, before breaking again in the fifth set with a 120 finish to level the match. In the third set, Littler broke throw in the second leg but Humphries broke back in the third leg and broke again in the fifth leg to re-take the match lead. Littler, however, levelled up the match again after breaking in the first leg of set 4, before taking the match lead for the first time after winning the fifth set 3–1. Littler then took the sixth set without dropping a leg to go into a 4–2 lead.\nThe seventh set went entirely against throw, with Littler ultimately missing one dart at double to take a 5–2 set lead and allowed Humphries to instead bring the match back to 4–3. Humphries won the eighth set 3–1 to bring the match level before breaking throw in the final leg of the ninth set to re-take the lead. Humphries got to one set away with a 3–1 win in the tenth set. The first four legs of the eleventh set went with throw before Littler missed three darts at double to take the final leg, before Humphries hit double 8 to win his first World Championship. This was Humphries' fourth premier tournament victory in four months, having won the World Grand Prix, Grand Slam and Players Championship Finals prior to the tournament. Humphries went to the number 1 spot on the PDC Order of Merit for the first time following the tournament, whilst Littler rose 133 places to go 31st.\nDraw.\nThe draw was held on 27 November 2023 and was conducted by former world champions Dennis Priestley and Phil Taylor.\nStatistics.\nHighest averages.\nThis table shows all averages over 100 achieved by players throughout the tournament.

        "title": "Triathlon (concerto)",
        "text": "\"Triathlon\" for Saxophonist and Orchestra is a saxophone concerto written in 2020 by the American composer John Corigliano. The work was commissioned by the San Francisco Symphony with support from Michèle and Larry Corash, to whom the piece is dedicated. Its world premiere, initially delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, was given by the saxophonist Timothy McAllister and the San Francisco Symphony conducted by Giancarlo Guerrero at the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall on April 7, 2022.\nComposition.\nStructure.\n\"Triathlon\" has a duration of roughly 30 minutes and is cast in three movements that each call for a different instrument in the saxophone family:\nThe movement titles correspond to different facets of the music. \"Leaps\" refers to wide intervals of the opening theme. In the score program note, Corigliano wrote, \"This melody utilizes the entire lyrical range of the soprano saxophone, and leads to a slower section that extends and develops the melody. But the joyous opening returns and the movement ends as it began — with a leap.\" The title of the second movement \"Lines\" refers the horizontal motion of its melody. The final movement \"Licks\" is named for the eponymous musical term, which refers to small improvisational moments in jazz. The composer added, \"While this is not a jazz movement, the idea of small ornamental turns appealed to me, and provided me with the inspiration for the solo writing.\"\nInstrumentation.\nThe concerto is scored for a solo saxophonist (playing soprano, alto, and baritone saxophone) and an orchestra comprising two flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), two oboes (2nd doubling Cor anglais), two clarinets ( 2nd doubling bass clarinet), two bassoons (2nd doubling contrabassoon), four horns, three trumpets, two trombones, bass trombone, tuba, timpani, three percussionists, piano, and strings.\nReception.\nReviewing the world premiere, the music critic Joshua Kosman of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" praised \"Triathlon\", writing, \"As the title suggests, it's a workout.\" He continued, \"Corigliano’s 30-minute extravaganza, which the [San Francisco] Symphony had originally commissioned for a 2020 premiere that was delayed by the COVID pandemic, was the highlight of Thursday's matinee program. It grabbed a listener's attention from the first notes, and lingered long in the memory after everything else had passed.\""

        "text": "The 1925–26 Williams Ephs men's ice hockey season was the 23rd season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAfter the close of the football season, the first meeting was held for the ice hockey team and Williams was set up well for a good season. With just one player departing due to graduation and team captain Harry Watkins returning in the same capacity, the Ephs had a solid foundation for their '26 campaign. This was the first year in the history of the program that the club came into the year knowing who their head coach would be and Philip Bower had ample time to get his team ready. Early on, however, the pool of players was curtailed by several prospective members being academically ineligible. Blaney, Ebenezer Smith and several players who were on last year's freshman team would be unavailable to the Ephs until at least February. Fortunately, many of the team's former starters were still on hand for the start of the season. As part of the team's membership in the Intercollegiate Ice Hockey Association, Williams was able to schedule dates with all the Ivy League teams. However, due to budget constraints, they were forced to cancel the proposed match with Yale on February 10. Though disappointing, that was the most palatable solution for Williams as the team would open the season with a 4-game series against the Elis.\nDue to an early chill, Williams was able to get their first on-ice practice in early December on Leake's Pond with about 40 men attending. Unfortunately, the weather did not hold and forced the team to find other means of training for over a week. They reformed to send 10 men up to Lake Placid to try and get as much practice in as possible before the matches with the Bulldogs. Watkins was back at his regular center position and flanked by Mason, Popham and Leonard Smith on the wings. Howe led the defense once more and was aided by Austin, Baker and Banks. Champman returned as the primary goaltender with Hutchins as his understudy. The hard work paid off in the first game when Williams defeated the 2-time defending Intercollegiate champions 3–1. The star of the game was Frederic Howe who, though suffering from an illness, managed to score twice. The Elis managed to brake through the Ephs' defense in the second match and evened the score with their own 3–2 win. The second game was played in a snowstorm and saw Yale get a narrow lead before Watkins tied the game after a furious attack. The weather conditions prevented the match from continuing beyond regulation but set up a deciding game on New Year's Day. Popham scored on a brilliant pass form Watkins in the second while Chapman and the defense proved to be invincible, turning aside everything the Elis could throw at them to take both the game and the series.\nWilliams kept rolling after their hot start in a match with the Apawamis club, easily winning 7–0, before heading to New York City to make their first appearance at Madison Square Garden. The building was brand new, having been open for just a few weeks, and the Ephs played before the largest crowd in the history of the program. Some 11,000 fans witnessed Williams take on Queen's and they were rewarded with a spectacular display of hockey. The Canadians opened the scoring but Watkins soon tied the match. After the Gaels got a second lead, Watkins scored his second goal of the game to send the match into overtime. Two 5-minute periods resulted in no further goals so another pair of overtimes was needed. Popham put the Ephs up by 1 in the third overtime but, in the longest game in the history of Williams hockey, the team was beginning to tire. After 77 minutes of ice time and few alternates used, the Ephs surrendered two goals in the final 3 minutes of the game and ended up on the losing end.\nHutchins was in goal for the team's next game, as was the second offensive unit of Mason, Austin and Banks, but little amounted from their efforts. It wasn't until the regular starters got into the game that the first goal was scored and Watkins again led the team with two of the three goals. Sticky ice slowed the match but hindered the home team just as much as the Ephs and Williams was able to shutout Rensselaer for their third zero of the season. Excellent ice conditions awaited the team for their first home game of the season and the Ephs used the atypical surface to great effect. Williams batter Bates 13–0 in one of the most lopsided results in program history. Watkins' 4 goals led the way but he assisted on several others as the Ephs had their way with the Bobcats. Dominant throughout the night, the starting forwards put up six goals in the first half of the match before they took a breather for the second half of the middle frame. Chapman, seeing little acting in the first, was replaced by Hutchins at the start of the second but the backup netminder had a rather easy night. Banks and Austin were each able to find the back of the cage and round out a stunning victory for Williams. The Purple continued their strong play against Boston University in a battle between two evenly-matched teams. Despite a strong goaltending performance from the scarlet netminder, Williams was able to dent the twine on three occasions with Watkins serving as the catalyst for the offense.\nThe next match for Williams was probably its most daunting challenge as the team was up against the preeminent power in college hockey, Harvard. Despite their tall task, Williams appeared to be the better of the two in the first period and gained a lead with Popham's opening marker. As the game wore on, Harvard was able to use is multitude of alternate players to wear down the Ephs as the Purple used just one extra player in the match. While the first and third periods went a standard 15 minutes, the middle from lasted for 20 minutes and saw the Purple flag badly in the later portion. Harvard scored three times in the second to take a lead they would not relinquish. The start to the third was delayed due to the first period of a match between BU and Bowdoin that took place in the interim. The long break allowed Williams to catch their breath and attempt a comeback but the Crimson defense was too good. Several scoring chanced were wiped away by the Harvard defenders while a fourth goal with about 5 minutes remaining put the final nail in Williams' coffin.\nThe team had to stew with that loss for over two weeks as their schedule was silent until after the exam break. Upon their return, no immediate changes were made to the lineup and nearly the same group that made the journey to Lake Placid headed over to Ithaca for the second road trip of the year. The team was supposed to kick of the back half of their schedule with a home game against Amherst on the 4th but that match had to be cancelled when the Lord Jeffs didn't show. Instead, Williams took on Cornell the following evening and got off to a quick start with three goals in the first. The Big Red picked up their play and tried to outmuscle the Ephs over the final 30 minutes but Williams was up to the task. Cornell scored four goals in the final two periods but the Purple got a pair themselves to stay in the lead and win by a single goal. The team took an overnight train to Buffalo and faced the Nichols Club, an amateur team made up of former college players. The game was slow due to soft ice but that didn't stop Williams from continuing their inspired play. The forward unit shelled the Nichols cage all night long and it was only through outstanding goaltending that the Ephs were limited to 3 goals. That was still enough to earn the Purple a victory and the team headed back to New York City hunting for bigger game.\nBefore the game with Dartmouth, Williams welcomed Blaney back into the lineup while freshmen Brigham and Field were now eligible to play, having completed one semester of study. Williams moved Smith to the second offensive group hoping to have plenty of substitutes for the team as they took on another imposing foe. This time the team was playing before 12,000 people at MSG but they couldn't quite provide the same level of drama as their earlier match. The Ephs did not look outclassed in the game and gave the Indians a tough challenge, but the Purple had a fatal tendency to play as individuals rather than as a team. A spectacular play from Watkins opened the scoring but Dartmouth took over afterwards and scored the final four goals of the match. While the game was a disappointment for Williams, as the team had been in the running for an Intercollegiate championship beforehand, the match had also doubled as benefit for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine and Bishop Manning had thanked the captains of both teams for their work before the start of the second period.\nWilliams returned home and, on a rink that had been built next to Sage Hall, proved they were still the class of the small colleges by dropping the Mass Aggies 7–0. Blaney's hat-trick showed that he was worthy of a spot on the top line while coach Bower used more than a dozen men in the contest including Ebenezer Smith and Shepler who were both seeing the first action of the season. The following game saw Williams post its first 10-win season in history when they took down rival Amherst. Despite playing a ragged game, the Ephs kept the puck in their opponent's end for most of the match and proved that they were still the class of the small colleges.\nOver the final week of the season, Williams squeezed in three games with the first coming at West Point. In spite of soft ice, the Ephs were able to hem the Cadets in their own end for most of the game. Williams wasn't able to score until the second half of the match but as Army was on the defensive the almost entire time that didn't harm the Ephs chances at winning. Two days later the team faced Amherst in a rematch and completely swamped the Lord Jeffs. Hat-tricks from Popham and Watkins provide more than enough as the Ephs skated away with an 11–0 victory with nearly every player on the team seeing some ice time. The slightly longer game (20 minute second period) also served to complete the Little Three championship for Williams. The final game of the season came a few days later when the Ephs travelled down to face Princeton. In an almost carbon-copy of their earlier match with Harvard, Williams jumped out to an early lead but vast reserves employed by the Tigers enabled the home team to wear down the Purple squad and eventually eke out a win. Popham's two goal in the first came on outstanding plays, however, that was all that Williams could muster. Princeton tied the game in the final minutes of the frame and then proceeded to wear out the Ephs over the final 40 minutes. By the time Hallock scored the winning goal it seemed inevitable that the Ephs would lose but only because they could not match the manpower of the Tigers.\nFrederick Cleveland served as team manager with Berkley Hotchkiss as his assistant.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1922–23 Maine Black Bears men's ice hockey season was the inaugural season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nIn late November, the athletic department decided to assume control of the ice hockey team from the intramural association. This formalized the adoption of the sport by Maine and began the first varsity campaign in program history. By early December, Cuddy Murphy had been chosen to coach the team and a schedule was put together with a fairly ambitious slate. Two games would be played with each of the three other Maine schools (Bates, Bowdoin and Colby) while several matches with schools from Massachusetts were in the works. While it was assumed at the time that the program would begin as a minor sport, the university decided to allow the student body to make the ultimate determination.\nUnfortunately, a warm winter caused many of the potential games to be either scrapped or delayed. Maine wasn't able to play its first game until February and, even then, the team had precious little time on the ice. In spite of these problems, the team didn't look bad in their loss to Colby. Before the match began, the two captains agreed to not have the outcome determine which of the two would play Bates at the Winter Carnival. Since the two were going to play a week later and Maine still needed some practice time on the ice they agreed to let the rematch decide that instead. A boisterous crowd was on hand for the Bears' first home game and the team provided their fans with the program's first victory. Drew Stearns was elected team captain just before the game and he responded by assisting on the final two goals to give the Black Bears a comeback win and a date with the Garnet in Augusta.\nMaine switched their lineup for the Bates match by moving Stearns to wing, Elliott to center and Coakley to defense. The hastily altered group faced off against the best team in the state. Somehow, the defense held strong and allowed just a single goal to the Garnet. Stearns scored two goals for the second game in a row and led the team to victory while also putting them into a position to potentially win the state title. Afterwards, Maine travelled to meet Bowdoin and suffered a defeat at the hands of the Polar Bears. Stover and Stone were dropped back to defense while Mackay moved up to wing. The changes kept the two teams close for most of the match though Bowdoin held a narrow 3–2 lead at the start of the third. Maine's defensive effort collapsed in the final frame and they surrendered 4 goals to make the game seem more lopsided that it actually was.\nA week later, the rematch with Bowdoin was held on poor ice but that didn't appear to slow down either team. After Stover started off the scoring twice in the first, Stearns grew the lead to 3 before the frame was out and Maine had a commanding lead after just 13 minutes. The Polar Bear surged back in the second and Maine was unable to stop the visitors from netting 4 goals in a stunning reversal of fortune. The choppy ice finally came into play in the third and helped prevent any more goals from being scored. The loss made it impossible for Maine to win the state championship but that didn't stop them from putting forth a valiant effort against Bates. The two fought bitterly with the Garnet still vying for the state title. Maine built a 2-goal lead thanks goals from Elliott and Stearns in the opening period. Bates cut the lead in half before the first intermission but Elliott restored the 2-goal margin early in the second. After Stearns got set off for a penalty, Bates came storming back and tied the game before the start of the third. The two exchanged goals early in the period but were unable to settle the score and overtime was required. The teams agreed to play two 5-minute periods but it wasn't until the end of the second that the winning goal was scored. Unfortunately, the puck was sent behind Baxter and Maine ended its season with another heartbreaking loss.\nHampton Bryant served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "The Showdown (rugby union)",
        "text": "The Showdown (previously known as Derby Day) is the annual showpiece rugby union match hosted by Saracens in Premiership Rugby, the top-flight professional rugby competition in England. Starting in 2009, the event has served as the club's marquee home fixture during each domestic season, usually against their closest rivals, fellow London club Harlequins. To date, the fixture has taken place at three large-capacity stadiums around the team's home city of London – Wembley Stadium, London Stadium and Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – and it has regularly achieved among the biggest crowds in the league since the 2009–10 season.\nThe event is notable for holding the current record for the highest ever attendance for a Premiership Rugby match, under its previous branding of 'Derby Day'. This record was set during the match between Saracens and Harlequins at Wembley on 28 March 2015, which had a live gate of 84,068 people – then a world record for a domestic club rugby union match, until this was broken by the 2016 Top 14 final. In addition, under its current branding of 'The Showdown', the fixture also holds the record as the most-watched Premiership game in the competition's 26-year history. This record was set during the match between Saracens and Harlequins on 25 March 2023, which attracted a combined peak television audience of 1.516 million people, accounting for 7.1 per cent share of all British TV viewers at that time. The figure surpassed the previous record, which had been set during the 2022 Premiership final, by 200,000 viewers.\nThe rivalry between Saracens and Harlequins also extends into women's rugby. Beginning in 2021, Premiership Women's Rugby clubs Saracens Women and Harlequins Women have met at Barnet Copthall each season for their own version of the annual showpiece match, under the banner of The Duel.\nHistory.\nPrior to launching their own showpiece event, Saracens had frequently been involved in the London Double Header at Twickenham Stadium, which took place between 2004 and 2017. Subsequently, for the 2009–10 season, the club announced it would stage three of its Premiership home games – as well as a special exhibition match against South Africa – at Wembley Stadium, in a bid to boost supporter numbers.\nThe event then moved to a once-a-year schedule, before being formally branded as 'Derby Day' in 2012, with local rivals Harlequins as the regular opponents. Between 2012 and 2015, this fixture broke the world record for a club rugby attendance on three occasions. After eight years at Wembley Stadium, Derby Day switched over to the London Stadium – the home of Premier League football club West Ham – in 2018 and 2019.\nIn 2019, Saracens announced an initial five-year stadium partnership with Tottenham Hotspur to host annual fixtures, under the new banner of 'The Showdown', at the Premier League club's ground. The opening installment of this collaboration was originally due to occur March 2020 – however, the COVID-19 pandemic led to the suspension of the 2019–20 season before this date. As a consequence, when the league resumed, games were played behind closed doors over the next six months. Once full-capacity crowds were allowed to return to stadia at the start of the 2021–22 season, Saracens finally held their first game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in March 2022, against Bristol Bears. Thereafter, the fixture reverted to the usual rivalry match-up with Harlequins from 2023 onwards.\nResults summary.\nThe following table outlines the results of each showpiece match hosted by Saracens in Premiership Rugby, with the winner listed in bold, and tied results listed in \"italics\":\nMatch details.\nSaracens vs Northampton (2009).\nSaracens held their first ever standalone showpiece match at Wembley Stadium in September 2009, defeating Northampton Saints by a score of 19–16. With a crowd of almost 45,000, the club also smashed its record attendance for a home game, with the next best figure recorded as 19,000, which was set during a league match at Vicarage Road in 1998.\nSaracens vs Worcester (2010).\nAfter setting a club attendance record in their inaugural appearance at Wembley Stadium, Saracens announced that they would stage two additional home fixtures at the ground during the 2009–10 season. In the first of these two extra games at Wembley, they beat Worcester Warriors by a score of 25–20.\nSaracens vs Harlequins (2010).\nFor the club's third and final visit to Wembley Stadium in the 2009–10 season, Saracens faced rivals Harlequins for the first time, establishing the basis for the showpiece fixture's future identity as 'Derby Day' and 'The Showdown'. Saracens were victorious, with the final score of 37–18.\nSaracens vs Wasps (2010).\nSaracens welcomed London Wasps for their return to Wembley Stadium on Boxing Day 2010. The home team picked up the victory with a final score of 13–6.\nDerby Day 1 (2012).\nSaracens and Harlequins contested the first incarnation of Derby Day at Wembley Stadium in March 2012, with the visitors emerging as the winners by 24–19 – the first and, to date, only away victory in this showpiece fixture. The match-day gate of 83,761 set a new world record for a rugby union club match, which was previously held by the 2009–10 Heineken Cup quarter-final match between Leinster and Munster at Croke Park.\nSaracens vs Leicester (2012).\nSaracens hosted Leicester Tigers for the 2012–13 showpiece at Wembley Stadium, instead of regular visitors Harlequins. The match ended in 9–9 draw – the first and, to date, only deadlocked result in the event's history.\nDerby Day 2 (2014).\nBeginning in the 2013–14 season, Saracens moved Derby Day to a consistent time slot in the spring, taking place shortly after the Six Nations Championship, with the target of improving on their attendance record from the 2011–12 season. In front of a new world record crowd of 83,889, which exceeded the figure set in the same fixture two seasons earlier, they triumphed over Harlequins with a final score of 39–17.\nDerby Day 3 (2015).\nSaracens and Harlequins confirmed that they would continue their burgeoning rivalry with a return to Wembley Stadium in March 2015. Saracens took the victory with a final score of 42–14 – their largest winning margin at the stadium. For the third consecutive meeting between the two teams at Wembley, a new world record was set, as 84,068 supporters attended to create the biggest ever crowd for a rugby union club match.\nDerby Day 4 (2016).\nSaracens and Harlequins met at Wembley Stadium once again in April 2016, with the home club earning the win with a score of 22–12. Although the fixture did not set a new attendance record, the match-day gate exceeded 80,000 for the third year in a row.\nDerby Day 5 (2017).\nThe 2017 edition of Derby Day was the event's last appearance at Wembley Stadium, before moving to alternative venues in subsequent years. Saracens beat Harlequins by a score of 40–19.\nDerby Day 6 (2018).\nAhead of the 2017–18 season, Saracens announced that their annual Derby Day fixture against Harlequins would take place at London Stadium for the first time. In the first ever Premiership match at the venue, Saracens won with a score of 24–11.\nDerby Day 7 (2019).\nSaracens confirmed they would return for their second and final outing at the London Stadium in March 2019. The home side earned the win over Harlequins with a final score of 27–20.\nThe Showdown 1 (2020).\nThe first edition of The Showdown, contested between Saracens and Harlequins, was originally scheduled for the final weekend of March 2020. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 forced its delay until August 2020 and prevented it from being held at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Hosted instead at Barnet Copthall, Saracens won the match with a bonus point, by a score of 38–24.\nThe Showdown 2 (2022).\nThe second edition of The Showdown, contested between Saracens and Bristol Bears, finally saw the event's debut at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in March 2022, a week after the end of the 2022 Six Nations Championship. Televised live on BT Sport, Saracens emerged victorious with a score of 27–23.\nThe Showdown 3 (2023).\nThe third edition of The Showdown, contested between Saracens and Harlequins, again took place one week on from the conclusion of the 2023 Six Nations Championship. Saracens achieved a bonus-point victory, with a score of 36–24, which also secured them a home berth in the 2022–23 Premiership play-offs. The game notably recorded the largest match-day attendance of the entire 2022–23 regular season. Broadcast simultaneously on both BT Sport and ITV, it also set a new viewership record, drawing the biggest ever audience for a Premiership match.\nThe Showdown 4 (2024).\nThe fourth edition of The Showdown saw Saracens face off against Harlequins for the second year in a row – taking place when the 2023–24 Premiership season resumed, one weekend after the 2024 Six Nations Championship had concluded. In front of their biggest crowd at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to date, Saracens achieved their largest ever victory over Harlequins, with a score of 52–7.\nA new individual record was also set during the match, as Saracens fly-half and captain Owen Farrell, on the occasion of his 250th appearance for the club, brought his total career points tally against Harlequins to 278 – the most ever by one player against a single Premiership team. As with the previous year, the fixture's simultaneous live broadcasts on ITV and TNT Sports broke Premiership television audience records, this time drawing the highest average viewership in the competition's history, at 913,000 people.\nSaracens vs South Africa (2009 exhibition match).\nIn September 2009, Saracens scheduled a special exhibition friendly against South Africa at Wembley Stadium in November – coinciding with the 2009 autumn internationals, during which the Springboks had lined up a tour of the Northern Hemisphere. The announcement followed investment by a South African consortium, which included former Springbok captains Francois Pienaar and Morné du Plessis, into Saracens earlier in 2009. The new investors stated the game was part of their objective to expand the club's supporter base, by tapping into the UK's South African expatriate community, and a number of players from the country were recruited to join Saracens ahead of the 2009–10 Premiership season, under director of rugby Brendan Venter.\nThe exhibition match took place on 17 November 2009, in front of a then-record live crowd for a Saracens fixture, with a total of 46,281 people in attendance. For the game, Saracens selected 10 South Africa-born players in their 22-man matchday squad. Overcoming a 12-point half-time deficit, Saracens eventually claimed a 24–23 victory, with former Springbok fly-half Derick Hougaard kicking the winning drop goal for the London club.\nTo date, this remains the only rugby union fixture to be contested between Saracens and South Africa, despite suggestions of a potential rematch over the subsequent years. Another exhibition game between the club and South African side Stormers at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium had been announced for an unconfirmed date in 2021, but this event ultimately never came to fruition, because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Duel (women's rugby).\nAs with their male counterparts, Saracens Women and Harlequins Women established a strong rivalry in Premiership Women's Rugby (formerly known as Premier 15s), having finished in the top two and competed in the play-off final in three consecutive seasons. During the 2019–20 season, Saracens announced that their home fixture against Harlequins would become an annual showpiece event under the banner of 'The Duel' – however, the first of these games, which was originally scheduled for April 2020, was cancelled, after the entire season was abandoned, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The launch eventually took place at the StoneX Stadium during the 2020–21 season.\nResults summary.\nThe following table outlines the results of each showpiece match hosted by Saracens Women in Premiership Women's Rugby, with the winner listed in bold, and tied results listed in \"italics\":\nMatch details.\nThe Duel 1 (2021).\nSaracens and Harlequins contested The Duel for the first time in March 2021. Due to temporary law changes implemented for the 2020–21 Premier 15s season, this was the only instance that the showpiece fixture had a 70-minute duration, rather than the usual 80 minutes. The match ultimately concluded in a 17–17 draw.\nThe Duel 2 (2021).\nSaracens hosted the second edition of The Duel in December 2021. On this occasion, Harlequins won by a score of 36–17.\nThe Duel 3 (2023).\nSaracens and Harlequins again met for the third incarnation of The Duel in February 2023. Saracens emerged as the victors, with a final score of 32–12. The event set a new club attendance record for a women's rugby home game, recording a live gate of 2,992 people.\nThe Duel 4 (2024).\nSaracens announced the return of The Duel for the fourth consecutive season in February 2024, with rivals Harlequins again confirmed as the opponents. Saracens withstood a late Harlequins comeback to claim victory, by a score of 29–24. For the second year in a row, the fixture recorded the largest ever crowd for a Saracens women's home match, exceeding 3,000 attendees at the StoneX Stadium for the first time."

        "text": "The 2023–24 UConn Huskies women's basketball team represented the University of Connecticut (UConn) during the 2023–24 NCAA Division I women's basketball season. The Huskies, led by Hall of Fame head coach Geno Auriemma in his 39th season at UConn, split their home games between Harry A. Gampel Pavilion on their campus in Storrs, Connecticut, and the XL Center in Hartford. UConn is a member of the Big East Conference, which it rejoined in the 2020–21 season; it had been a member of the original Big East Conference from 1979 through 2013, and one of the original women's basketball teams in that conference in 1982.\nUConn was ranked second in pre-season polls, but lost three early non-conference games and several key players to injury by midseason. The Huskies went undefeated in Big East conference play and the post-season conference tournament, anchored by previous All-Americans Aaliyah Edwards and Paige Bueckers. Both players were selected to 2023–24 All-Big East and All-American teams; point guard Nika Mühl was an All-Big East selection and completed the season as UConn's all-time career assist leader. The Huskies entered the NCAA tournament seeded third in their bracket, but emerged victorious with Bueckers awarded most outstanding player. The Caitlin Clark-led Iowa Hawkeyes defeated the Huskies in their Final Four contest, a match watched by a record 14.4 million ESPN college basketball viewers. UConn ended the season 33–6, ranked #3 in both polls. Both Edwards and Mühl were selected in the 2024 WNBA draft.\nPrevious season.\nThe 2022–23 UConn Huskies began with season-ending injuries to All-American junior guard Paige Bueckers and freshman forward Ice Brady. The team played well in the early season, but injuries to Azzi Fudd, Dorka Juhász, and Caroline Ducharme often forced starters like Nika Mühl, Aaliyah Edwards, and Aubrey Griffin to play full games and graduate transfer Lou Lopez Sénéchal to take on scoring responsibilities. Mühl ranked second among all NCAA women in assists during the season, UConn relying on her high energy and court vision to make Husky touches in the paint quick and decisive. With a light bench, Edwards, Mühl, Juhász, Lopez Sénéchal, and Griffin became a durable quintet in January; when Fudd and Ducharme returned, the team quickly improved. UConn dominated the Big East tournament. In the NCAA tournament, they advanced to their 29th consecutive Sweet Sixteen before being upset by a swarming Ohio State Buckeyes defense. This was the first time the Huskies failed to reach the Final Four since 2007 (not counting the COVID-disrupted 2019–20 season in which the NCAA tournament was not held).\nOffseason.\nDepartures.\nThe Huskies graduated senior starters Dorka Juhász and Lou Lopez Sénéchal from the 2022–23 roster, and both were drafted into the Women's National Basketball Association.\nInjuries.\nFreshman center Jana El Alfy suffered an achilles injury in August while playing for the Egyptian national U19 team and later underwent corrective surgery.\nRecruiting.\nESPN evaluated UConn's class of 2023 as the fourth-ranked group in the country, behind LSU, South Carolina, and Arizona.\nRecruiting class of 2024.\nOn December 3, 2022, UConn received a verbal commitment from five-star guard Allie Ziebell. Fellow five-star guard Morgan Cheli committed to UConn soon after. In November 2023, ESPN ranked the Huskies' 2024 class as the sixth-best in the country. On April 6, 2024, the #1 player in the class of 2024, five-star forward Sarah Strong, also committed to UConn. \nCoaching.\nHall of Fame head coach Geno Auriemma and Hall of Fame associate head coach Chris Dailey returned for their 39th season. Assistant coach Jamelle Elliott was a UConn assistant coach from 1998 to 2009 and returned after a nine-year head coaching stint at Cincinnati. Assistant coach Morgan Valley was the head coach of the Hartford Hawks when hired by the Huskies. Elliott and Valley are both former UConn players. Tonya Cardoza, another former Huskies assistant, returned to UConn in June after serving as Temple's head coach for 15 years. Also in June, UConn announced Ben Kantor was promoted to assistant coach from his previous staff position serving as the team's video coordinator since 2015. On February 7, 2024, this year's squad defeated Seton Hall for Auriemma's 1200th career win. He became only the third NCAA basketball coach to reach that mark.\nSeason summary.\nEven after graduating two WNBA draftees, the Huskies entered the season with six reliable and tested starters, led by seniors Nika Mühl, Aubrey Griffin, and 2023 All-American Aaliyah Edwards. Juniors Azzi Fudd, Caroline Ducharme, and 2021 All-American Paige Bueckers returned in the backcourt. UConn were ranked #2 in the preseason AP and Coaches polls.\nHowever, the Huskies' injury problems of the previous few seasons continued to plague them. Freshman center Jana El Alfy got hurt during the offseason. Sophomore forward Ayanna Patterson suffered a knee injury in December and never played a game. Fudd only played two games before suffering a non-contact injury in practice in November. She was diagnosed with an ACL injury and was out for the rest of the season. Ducharme, who had previously struggled with recurring neck issues, only played four games. On January 23, she announced that she would not be returning to play this season.\nUConn's injuries, combined with a tough non-conference schedule, led to three losses to quality opponents in their first seven games of the season. The Huskies then went on a 13-game winning streak as they started their Big East schedule, though they became even more shorthanded when Griffin experienced an ACL tear in her left knee during the Creighton game on January 3. For most of the season, UConn ran out a starting lineup of forward Edwards, guards Bueckers and Mühl, and freshmen guards KK Arnold and Ashlynn Shade. Freshmen forward Ice Brady and guard Qadence Samuels were the primary substitutes on a very short bench. Forward Amari DeBerry and guard Inês Bettencourt provided spot minutes when needed.\nWith Bueckers leading the team in points, Edwards leading in rebounds, and Mühl leading in assists, UConn went 18–0 in the Big East to win the conference regular season title. They never dropped out of the top 25 in the AP and Coaches polls. During this time, they lost two more games to ranked non-conference opponents, but they won all of their Big East games by at least 15 points and had an overall record of 26–5 going into the postseason. Bueckers was named the Big East Player of the Year.\nUConn entered the Big East tournament in March on a six-game winning streak. DeBerry was ruled out for the rest of the season after going into concussion protocol, and in the quarterfinals, Edwards suffered a broken nose. This left the Huskies with just seven players available for the rest of the Big East tournament. UConn went on to win the tournament anyway to clinch a berth in the NCAA tournament. It was their 11th straight conference tournament championship. In the NCAA tournament, UConn won their first four games before losing in the Final Four. They finished their season with an overall record of 33–6 and were ranked #3 in the final AP and Coaches polls.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"\"| Exhibition \n!colspan=12 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=|Big East tournament\n!colspan=12 style=|NCAA tournament"

        "text": "The curling competition at the 2026 Winter Olympics will feature a total of 30 teams. There will be 10 teams participating in each of the three disciplines: Men's, Women's, and Mixed Doubles. In the Men's and Women's events, each team will consist of 5 athletes, while the Mixed Doubles teams will have 2 athletes each. This means that a total of 120 athletes will be competing across all disciplines.\nSummary.\nFinal summary.\nAs the host country of the 2026 Winter Olympics, Italy will have teams participating in all three disciplines of curling. This marks Italy's second participation in the Women's event, with their previous appearance dating back to the 2006 Winter Olympics.\nQualification timeline.\n\"Source:\"\nQualification system.\nQualification to the curling tournaments at the Winter Olympics will be determined through two methods. Nations will qualify teams by earning qualification points from performances at the 2024 and 2025 World Curling Championships. Teams will also qualify through an Olympic qualification event which will be held in December 2025. Seven nations will qualify teams via World Championship qualification points, while two nations will qualify through a qualification event to be held in December 2025. As host nation, Italy qualified teams automatically, thus making a total of ten teams per discipline in the curling tournaments.\nIn case of a tie in qualification points, the following criteria will be employed to resolve such ties: firstly, preference will be given to the nation that most recently appeared at the World Championship; secondly, if necessary, preference will be given to the nation that performed better at the 2025 World Championship, if that is a tie then whichever nation preformed better at the 2024 World Championship will win the tie; and finally, if neither of the first two criteria suffice, a playoff will be arranged between the tied teams at a time and venue determined by World Curling.\nQualification points.\nThe qualification points are allotted based on the nations' final rankings at the Men's and Women's World Championships. The points are distributed as follows:\nThe qualification points are allotted based on the nations' final rankings at the Mixed Doubles World Championships. The points are distributed as follows:\nNote: Scotland, England and Wales all compete separately in international curling. By an agreement between the curling federations of those three home nations, only Scotland can score Olympic qualification points on behalf of Great Britain.\nQualification events.\nIn order to qualify for the Olympic Qualification Event in the Men's and Women's disciplines, a nation must be ranked between 9th and 13th (or between 8th and 12th if Italy is not ranked in the top 8 teams of the discipline) based on the combined results of the 2024 and 2025 World Curling Championships. Alternatively, they can qualify by finishing in the top 3 at the Pre-Olympic Qualification Event. To be eligible for the Pre-Olympic Qualification Event, a nation must not have already qualified for the Olympics or the Olympic Qualification Event. They must have also qualified for either the 2024 or 2025 World Men's or Women's Championships, or have qualified in the A division of the 2024 or 2025 European Curling Championship or Pan Continental Curling Championships.\nIn the Mixed Doubles event, a nation can qualify for the Olympic Qualification Event by participating in either the 2024 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship or the 2025 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship. There will be no Pre-Olympic Qualification Event for this discipline. However, if the Olympic Qualification Event has less than 16 teams participating, the World Curling Federation Mixed Doubles Rankings as of May 1, 2025 will be used to determine the remaining berths until there are at least 16 teams participating in the Olympic Qualification Event.\nQualification results.\nMixed doubles.\nNote: Scotland, England and Wales all compete separately in international curling.

        "text": "The 1923–24 Bowdoin Polar Bears men's ice hockey season was the 5th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nChanges were coming for the hockey program in 1924. The first was a new policy that affected several programs at the school; Bowdoin adopted the increasingly popular one-semester rule that barred freshman from participating in varsity sports until they had completed at least one semester of classes. The school's athletic council announced their decision after a meeting on December 20 and it would be implemented immediately. This caused the team to have to wait for several prospective players who had already been training with the team since the beginning of the month. While another warm winter played havoc with the available ice, the team was trying to sort itself out without a head coach. Al Morrell, who had served as a player/coach for two years, had graduated and was no longer able to serve in that capacity.\nBy the time the first game rolled around, the Polar Bears had yet to hold a single practice as a group and had been consigned to working out in the gymnasium. It was hardly surprising that Bowdoin was unable to score a single goal in their first two matches, both held in Lewiston, despite all of its starters having played the year before. The weather refused to comply with Bowdoin's desires and a further game with Colby was postponed to a later date.\nBowdoin wasn't able to play its third game until after the exam break though that did allow the freshman players to join the varsity squad. While the lack of practice was still an omnipresent issue, the team was hoping to get onto the right track against Maine. With Berry now manning the pipes, Nichols was a reserve forward along with new entry Cole. The Polar Bears were able to finally get on the scoresheet but they were once more outplayed due to a lack of teamwork. Mercifully, the ice solidified enough to allow Bowdoin to get some training time in for the next game. The awaited match with Colby finally was held on the 13th and the team looked like a completely different team. While starting the exact same players as they had against Maine, Bowdoin led off the scoring and then exploded for 3 goals in the second period. They were matched goal for goal by the Mules and ended regulation with 4 each. Three overtime periods passed without effect and the game was called due to darkness. Bowdoin retained the newfound vigor for their rematch with Maine and demonstrated just how important practice was for the team. In a complete reversal of fortune, Bowdoin dominated the game from the outset, scoring three goals in the first period, two coming from Cutter, to take a commanding lead. The White defense was the star in the second and stopped many a rush from the Blues. Cutter finished off his hat-trick in the third to lead the club to its first win of the season.\nJust as the team was getting into its stride, the ice melted and prevented the team from playing all but one game for the rest of the season. The final game was a rematch with Colby that saw both teams slowed by very soft ice. Cutter netter the only goal for the Bears but it was enough to secure a tie. Due to having three of their state series games cancelled, Bowdoin finished with a 1–2–2 record which was good enough for them to finish in a tie for second with Maine (Bates was undefeated in 5 games).\nJohn Whitcomb served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "Shortly before 09:54 BST on 6 July 2023, a Land Rover Defender crashed into an end-of-year tea party and injured several people, mainly children, at The Study, a girls' preparatory school in Wimbledon, south-west London, England. An eight-year-old girl died later that day and another on 9 July. The driver, a 46-year-old woman from Wimbledon, was arrested and bailed on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.\nThe crash was widely reported on the front pages of national newspapers the day following the crash, and inspired several acts of vandalism against SUVs in the United Kingdom. As of February 2024, investigations into the crash are ongoing.\nIncident.\nAt 09:54 BST on 6 July 2023, the London Ambulance Service received calls of a collision at an end-of-year tea party at The Study Preparatory School, a preparatory school for girls aged four to eleven in Wimbledon's Camp Road, at the edge of Wimbledon Common. A Land Rover Defender had crashed through the school's wooden fence and into a building. It was the school's last day before the summer holidays.\nThe London Ambulance Service declared a major incident. Fifteen ambulances and thirty-five police vehicles were dispatched to the scene, as well as the London Air Ambulance. Sixteen patients were treated at the school and ten patients were hospitalised. Those injured included pupils, parents and carers, but not school staff. Wimbledon and Putney Commons, who manage the Common, urged the public to stay away from the area to allow free access to the emergency services. The incident prompted \"the largest local policing deployment in south-west London since 2017\".\nAn eight-year-old girl died on the day of the crash. A second eight-year-old girl died on 9 July at St George's Hospital. By the end of July, all the hospitalised children had returned home.\nReactions.\nThe crash prompted statements from politicians including Stephen Hammond, Wimbledon's MP, Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, Gillian Keegan, the Education Secretary, Suella Braverman, the Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, the Shadow Home Secretary, and a spokesman for the Prime Minister. Merton Council offered counselling to affected pupils, staff, and families.\nThe incident was widely reported on the front pages of national newspapers the day following the crash. The crash took place during the first week of the 2023 Wimbledon Championships, hosted at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club northeast of the school.\nNorman Baker, the former Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, commented after the crash that 4x4s are \"completely inappropriate for urban locations\".\nA week following the crash, anti-SUV campaigners in Broughty Ferry, a suburb of Dundee, Scotland, vandalised a Range Rover and left a warning letter with headshots of the deceased girls. In August 2023, the Tyre Extinguishers activist group described their puncturing of the tyres of more than 60 SUVs at a Land Rover dealership in Exeter as an \"act of retaliation\" to the incident in Wimbledon.\nInvestigations.\nThe crash was not considered to be terror-related. The driver, a 46-year-old woman from Wimbledon, was hospitalised with a non-life threatening condition. She was arrested and bailed on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.\nOn 12 July, inquests into the two girls' deaths were adjourned at Inner West London Coroner's Court. On 20 July, the driver was rebailed until late September 2023. On 23 September, she was rebailed until January 2024.\nIn November 2023, Moore Barlow, a law firm supporting twenty families affected by the crash, publicly questioned the delay in the case. The parents of the second girl who died spoke to BBC London. On 31 December, in an interview article with \"The Times\", the parents released a photo of the mother and daughter taken moments before the crash. In February 2024, the parents of the first girl spoke to Vanessa Feltz on TalkTV, expressing their lack of confidence in the Metropolitan Police and criticising the delay in the investigation. They released a video of the girl playing \"The Entertainer\" on the piano at the school concert preceding the crash.\nOn 1 February 2024, the driver was released pending investigation. The lawyer representing the families criticised the decision as providing \"no time scale\" to the investigation's conclusion, calling on a \"new protocol...where investigations by the police should be carried out expeditiously\"."

For the first time, eight separate nations were represented in the competition.\nThe Black Lion Tbilisi from Georgia, as winners of the 2022 edition are also competing by invitation in the second tier European Challenge Cup, the first time the winner of the Super Cup has been integrated into the professional EPCR competition.\nGroup stage.\nThe format was mildly rejigged from previous seasons with a 'major' and 'minor' group, rather than two geographical pools, although the distribution was roughly north (Group B) and south (Group A). \nThe 'major' group, Group A contained the four highest seeds, three of whom qualify for the semi finals. The 'minor' group, Group B, contained the teams ranked 5th to 8th, and the winner of that group became the fourth semi finalist. The aim was to ensure relative competitiveness across the competition.\nTel Aviv Heat played both of its home fixtures outside Israel due to the ongoing conflict in Gaza."

        "text": "The 2024 Stanley Cup playoffs is the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL) for the 2023–24 season. The playoffs began on April 20, 2024, and will conclude no later than June 24, 2024, with the 2024 Stanley Cup Finals, to determine the winner of the Stanley Cup.\nThe New York Rangers made the playoffs as the Presidents' Trophy winners with the most points (i.e. best record) during the regular season. Both the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs extended their playoff streaks to eight consecutive seasons, the longest active streaks in the NHL. For the second year in a row and third time since entering the NHL as expansion teams in the 1967–68 NHL season, both Pennsylvania-based teams (the Flyers and Penguins) missed the playoffs in the same season.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThis is the ninth year in which the top three teams in each division make the playoffs, along with two wild cards in each conference (for a total of eight playoff teams from each conference).\nThe following teams have qualified for the playoffs:\nPlayoff bracket.\nIn each round, teams compete in a best-of-seven series following a 2–2–1–1–1 format (scores in the bracket indicate the number of games won in each best-of-seven series). The team with home ice advantage plays at home for games one and two (and games five and seven, if necessary), and the other team plays at home for games three and four (and game six, if necessary). The top three teams in each division made the playoffs, along with two wild cards in each conference, for a total of eight teams from each conference. \nIn the first round, the lower seeded wild card in the conference plays against the division winner with the best record while the other wild card plays against the other division winner, and both wild cards are de facto #4 seeds. The other series match the second and third-place teams from the divisions. In the first two rounds, home-ice advantage is awarded to the team with the better seed. Thereafter, it is awarded to the team that had the better regular season record.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nFirst round.\nEastern Conference first round.\n(A1) Florida Panthers vs. (WC1) Tampa Bay Lightning.\nThe Florida Panthers finished first in the Atlantic Division earning 110 points. The Tampa Bay Lightning finished as the Eastern Conference's first wild card earning 98 points. This was the third playoff meeting between these two rivals with Tampa Bay winning both previous series. They last met in the 2022 Eastern Conference second round, which Tampa Bay won in a four-game sweep. Florida won two of the three games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Panthers defeated the Lightning in five games. Aleksander Barkov assisted twice for the Panthers in game one, emerging victorious for a 3–2 score. In game two, Carter Verhaeghe scored the overtime game-winning goal for the Panthers, providing a 3–2 victory for Florida and a 2–0 series lead. Matthew Tkachuk scored twice for the Panthers in game three, pushing the series to a 3–0 series lead with a 5–3 win. In game four, Steven Stamkos and Brandon Hagel both scored twice for Tampa Bay to prevent a series sweep by Florida, defeating the Panthers 6–3 to force game five. However, Barkov and Verhaeghe both scored twice and provided an assist for the Panthers in the subsequent game five, routing the Lightning 6–1 to advance to the second round.\n(A2) Boston Bruins vs. (A3) Toronto Maple Leafs.\nThe Boston Bruins finished second in the Atlantic Division earning 109 points. The Toronto Maple Leafs earned 102 points to finish third in the Atlantic. This is the seventeenth playoff meeting between these two rivals with both teams splitting the sixteen previous series.

Washington finished as the Eastern Conference's second wild card earning 91 points, winning the tiebreaker against Detroit with 32 . This was the tenth playoff meeting between these two rivals with New York winning five of the nine previous series. They last met in the 2015 Eastern Conference second round, which New York came back from a 3–1 series deficit to win in seven games. These teams split their four-game regular season series.\nThe Rangers defeated the Capitals in a four-game sweep.

In game four, Artemi Panarin scored a goal and provided an assist to the Rangers' 4–2 victory, completing the four-game sweep. It was the first sweep for the Rangers since 2007, and they became the sixth Presidents' Trophy-winning team to sweep their opening-round series.\n(M2) Carolina Hurricanes vs. (M3) New York Islanders.\nThe Carolina Hurricanes finished second in the Metropolitan Division earning 111 points. The New York Islanders earned 94 points to finish third in the Metropolitan. This was the second consecutive and third overall playoff meeting between these two teams with Carolina winning both previous series. Carolina won the previous year's Eastern Conference first round in six games. These teams split their four-game regular season series.\nThe Hurricanes defeated the Islanders in five games.

The table is sorted by GAA, and the criteria for inclusion are bolded.\nMedia.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, this marks the tenth postseason under Rogers Media's 12-year contract. Games air across the Sportsnet networks and CBC under the \"Hockey Night in Canada\" brand. For first and second-round U.S.–U.S. games not on CBC, Sportsnet generally simulcasts the U.S. feed instead of producing their own telecast. The 2024 Stanley Cup Finals will be simulcast on both CBC and Sportsnet. Sportsnet+ streams all games, and CBC Gem will also stream games televised on CBC.\nUnited States.\nIn the U.S., this marks the third year of a seven-year agreement with the ESPN family of Networks and TNT Sports. Games in the first two rounds air across ESPN, ESPN2, ABC; and TNT, TBS. TruTV is also simulcasting selected TNT Sports-produced games. Each U.S. team's regional broadcaster is also televising local coverage of first round games, except for games on ABC. First and second-round games are roughly evenly split between ESPN-produced telecasts and TNT Sports-produced telecasts, while working around their broadcast commitments to the 2024 NBA playoffs. With the Stanley Cup playoffs starting on the same day as the NBA playoffs this year, TBS and TruTV have the first pair of first-round games on that Saturday, April 20. ESPN and ESPN2 aired the games on Sunday, April 21 through Tuesday, April 23. Games were then split between ESPN and TNT Sports produced telecasts on Wednesday, April 24 and Thursday, April 25; before TNT/TBS/TruTV have the games from Friday, April 26 to Sunday, April 28, ESPN will then air games on Monday, April 29 before games will again be split between ESPN and TNT Sports produced telecasts on Tuesday April 30, following that the games will shift back to ESPN on Wednesday May 1 (ESPN2 was originally scheduled to air a game however there was only 2 series remain to air that day), TBS will then air the only game the next day (Thursday May 2).\nESPN/ABC will then have the first choice of which conference finals series to broadcast, and TNT will air the other series. As per the alternating rotation, ABC will have coverage of the 2024 Stanley Cup Finals.\nThis is the first playoffs that the streaming service Max will have live access to all TNT Sports-produced games on its Bleacher Report Sports Add-on tier. ESPN+ will stream all ABC games and selected ESPN games.\nThis is the third of a four-year deal that Sports USA Radio Network will syndicate select Stanley Cup playoff games via NHL Radio across the U.S., including the entire conference finals and Stanley Cup Finals."

This was the third consecutive year in which Uganda had toured Namibia, following similar bilateral series in April 2021 and April 2022. The series provided both sides with an opportunity to continue their preparations for the T20 World Cup Africa Qualifier in November 2023.\nAhead of the series, Namibia hosted a series of five 50-over matches against the Indian state side Karnataka in June 2023, which the visitors won 3–2. Meanwhile, Uganda travelled to Windhoek having recently won the inaugural Continent Cup T20 Africa in Nairobi.\nSquads.\nRiazat Ali Shah missed the tour due to losing his passport. Henry Ssenyondo and Simon Ssesazi returned home after the first match of the series following the death of their mother, and they were replaced in Uganda's squad by Fred Achelam and Pius Oloka. Juma Miyagi also left the tour after the first match due to injury, and was replaced by Joseph Baguma. Due to a shortage of players, Uganda added team manager and former player Charles Waiswa to their squad ahead of the second T20 match."

        "title": "1924–25 Williams Ephs men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1924–25 Williams Ephs men's ice hockey season was the 22nd season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nWith the Ephs behind their third head coach in as many years, the team took a major step forward in the offseason when it was admitted into the Intercollegiate Ice Hockey Association. Williams was one of just two small colleges (the other being Hamilton) in the group with the other members being the seven active Ivy League schools. Rather than form a conference and compile a schedule, the league met to decide upon a uniform set of rules for college hockey, a vital necessity as there was no national governing body for the sport. The inclusion of Williams raised the profile for the program and gave it an authority commensurate with the school's longstanding dedication to the sport.\nThe team was also undergoing several changes on the ice, both positive and negative. With the loss of several key contributors, most notably star goaltender Marvin Lowes, Williams would need to replace a good number of its '24 lineup. Fortunately, the team had a very sizable contingent of players to pick from; 42 men showed up to the first practice which, unusually, was held in November. After having to deal with warm winters for several seasons, the region welcomed in an early chill and the surface of Leake's Pond froze over before Thanksgiving. At the time the team was being led solely by team captain Harry Watkins as a coach for the team had yet to be hired. In mid-December, the administration decided upon J. Philip Bower as the team's head coach and he immediately assumed the reigns.\nWith the team's impending Christmas trip to Lake Placid just weeks away, Bower had a shot time to put his stamp on the program. He did his best to organize the team around Watkins at center with Smith, Blaney and Popham on the wings. Howe, the veteran blueliner, stayed at his normal position while several players were cycled through on the other point. Chapman had an unenviable task of following one of the program's best goaltenders but still acquitted himself well in the opening series with Yale. Entering the games with fewer numbers and less preparation, the Ephs were soundly beaten in the first two matches. The defensing intercollegiate champion Elis were too fast for the Purple to keep up but, once they got their skating legs under them, Williams proved to be a match for the Bulldogs. The third game saw a much closer contest with the Ephs fighting back in the third. Watkins led a third period surge that came up just shy with the Purple falling 2–3. Though winless to this point, the Ephs strengthening performance in the series continued as they travelled to Buffalo and rolled over the Nichols hockey club 7–2. Popham was the star of the game with 4 goals but the biggest surprise came in the final match of the winter break when Williams defeated Princeton. The Tigers only goal came from when Popham accidentally knocked the puck into his own cage while Howe and Austin kept the Princeton attack at bay.\nAfter their relatively successful start, the team was looking forward to a slate of 10 further games and opened against Massachusetts Agricultural. Unfortunately, poor ice conditions on the MAC rink forced the two teams onto a nearby pond. The less-than-satisfactory conditions were worsened by the lack of boards that forced the team to adapt a new style of play. The Ephs were unable to adjust in time and fell to the home team 0–2. After returning home, the team was met by the unwelcome sight of another warm winter. The team was hardly able to practice over a 2-week span and had to cancel a few games before finally squeezing in a match with Bates. As if he was making up for lost time, Watkins set a program record with 7 of the team's 8 goals in the game as the Ephs smothered the Bobcats. The game also had the distinction of being longer than normal with three 18-minute periods instead of the standard 15-minute frames.\nThe exam break caused the next pause to the season and Williams didn't play another game until early February. When they did get back onto the ice the Ephs demonstrated an overpowering brand of hockey seldom seen in a Purple jersey by hammering their ancient rivals, Amherst, 12–1. Watkins and Popham each recorded 4 goals in the game while Howe netted a pair. Several games remained on the team's schedule, however, due to a thaw throughout the region, Williams ended up having to cancel the remainder of their season. In all, the Ephs lost seven games to poor weather conditions, a fade made worse with how well the Purple had performed throughout the year.\nFrank Gummey served as team manager with Frederick Cleveland as his assistant.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 2024 Rose Bowl was a college football bowl game played on January 1, 2024, at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. The 110th annual Rose Bowl was one of the semifinals of the 2023–24 College Football Playoff (CFP) and featured two of the four teams selected by the CFP Selection Committee—the fourth-ranked Alabama Crimson Tide of the SEC and the first-ranked Michigan Wolverines of the Big Ten. Michigan won the game 27–20, shortly after Blake Corum's 17-yard touchdown run in overtime, and stopping Alabama on downs. Michigan advanced to face the winner of the Sugar Bowl, the Washington Huskies, in the CFP National Championship game on January 8. With 27.2 million viewers on ESPN, the 2024 Rose Bowl was the most-viewed College Football Playoff semifinal game since 2014, as well as one of the top ten cable telecasts of all time.\nThe Rose Bowl was one of the 2023–24 bowl games concluding the 2023 FBS football season. The game began at approximately 2:00 p.m. PST and was aired on ESPN. Sponsored by Prudential Financial, the game was officially known as the College Football Playoff Semifinal at the Rose Bowl Game presented by Prudential.\nTeams.\nThe game featured Michigan, undefeated champion of the Big Ten, and Alabama, one-loss champion of the SEC. This was the sixth meeting between the two teams, with their most recent meeting being in the 2020 Citrus Bowl, where Alabama beat Michigan by a score of 35–16. Entering the game, Alabama led the overall series, 3–2. Alabama wore white jerseys while Michigan wore blue jerseys. The teams were welcomed to Southern California at Disneyland Resort on December 27. The teams entered the game as the two winningest programs in college football history.\nMichigan.\nMichigan went undefeated in their 12-game regular season. Due to punishment from recruiting violations and a sign-stealing scandal, they were without their head coach Jim Harbaugh for six of those games. They still defeated their arch-rival Ohio State, 30–24, allowing them to advance to the 2023 Big Ten Football Championship Game, where they defeated Iowa, 26–0. Entering the game, Michigan was one of just four undefeated FBS teams, at 13–0.\nThis was Michigan's 21st appearance in the Rose Bowl—they were 8–12 in prior editions. The Wolverines lost their previous three Rose Bowl appearances, in 2004, 2005 and 2007. Their last Rose Bowl win came in 1998, where they defeated Washington State by a 21–16 score to win the national championship.\nAlabama.\nAlabama went 11–1 in their 12-game regular season. A 34–24 loss in Week 2 to Texas followed by a narrow victory over USF caused them to tumble down the rankings to No. 13 in the AP poll, but they managed to recover and reach a record of 10–1 entering their Iron Bowl game against Auburn. Alabama won the game, 27–24, thanks to a 31-yard touchdown pass from Jalen Milroe to Isaiah Bond on 4th-and-goal. In the 2023 SEC Championship Game, they defeated two-time defending national champion Georgia, 27–24, ending the latter team's 29-game winning streak.\nThis was Alabama’s eighth Rose Bowl appearance (1926, 1927, 1931, 1935, 1938, 1946, 2021). They were 5–1–1 in prior Rose Bowls.\nHall of Fame.\nPrior to the game, Cliff Montgomery, Columbia; Kirk Herbstreit, ESPN and Ohio State; and Lincoln Kennedy, Washington, were inducted to the 2023 class of the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame."

        "text": "The Italy men's national lacrosse team represents Italy in international lacrosse competitions. It is organized by the Federazione Italiana Giuoco Lacrosse. It has participated in 4 World championships and 5 European championships.\nIt was initially formed exclusively by naturalised players due to the almost total absence of the discipline in Italy. Subsequently, thanks to the important development of Lacrosse in Italy, starting from the 2008 European Championships in Lahti, Italy was able to field a majority of native players, a feature strongly desired and pursued by the FIGL and its founders Fabio Antonelli and Robert Corna to encourage the growth of sport in the country.\nHistory.\nThe history of the Italian national lacrosse team began in 2002 with the formation of a team (called \"Italy United\") made up exclusively of naturalised players who participated in an international lacrosse tournament associated with the 2002 World Lacrosse Championship in Perth. Promoter of the initiative, as well as captain and coach of the team, was the Italian-American Robert Corna, the first athlete to practice lacrosse in Italy and to promote its diffusion at a national level.\nIn 2004, the Italian national team led by Robert Corna participated, with teams made up of both native Italian and naturalised players, in the European Championship Newcomer's Tournament in Salzburg and in the European Lacrosse Championship in Prague.\nIn 2006, an Italian team made up exclusively of naturalised players finished the world championship held in London, Ontario in 10th place, achieving important victories against Hong Kong (20-0), Wales (20-7), Scotland (10- 7) and the Czech Republic (14-7), before bowing out to Finland (10-9) in the play-off for 9th place.\nFollowing the birth of the Federazione Italiana Giuoco Lacrosse (founded in 2007), lacrosse began to develop more on the Italian peninsula, through the foundation of lacrosse clubs that allowed the national team to train native players. A young and inexperienced Italy, with many rookies in the squad, then participated in the 2008 European Championships in Lahti, finishing in 18th place.\nThanks to a newer national league and to better training and infrastructures, Italy started the 2010 World Cup in Manchester with greater talent and experience. The Azzurri ended the tournament with a victory over Latvia (13-8) which allowed them to close the world championship in 19th place.\nAt the 2012 European Championships in Amsterdam, the Italian national team ranked 13th out of 20 participating nations, winning 6 matches, 4 of which in a row. The Azzurri thus obtained the highest number of victories in an international competition. It also equalled the number of 4 consecutive victories of the national team which occurred in 2006, 2010 and 2023.\nAt the 2023 World Lacrosse Championship, the Italian national team reached its best result ever after winning the 9th place game against Puerto Rico."

        "text": "The 1928–29 Bates men's ice hockey season was the 10th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAt the start of the season, the program received some very unwelcome news. Carleton Wiggin, who had led the Bobcats for the previous 6 seasons and won 3 state championships, was being released from his position as athletics coach. While 'Wig\" had gotten good records with the ice hockey team and solid if unspectacular results from the baseball squad, he was less effective as the coach of the football team. Under his watch, Bates had never had a winning season on the gridiron and had just finished a winless campaign, going 0–7. Even with the lack of success on the field, Wiggin was still a popular figure on campus, having also been a 4-sport star as an undergraduate. While the college could have kept him on staff in some capacity, the administration decided to have one man coach the baseball, hockey and football teams and announced that Dave Morey would take over at the start of the following school year. Wiggin was allowed to finish out the year as the coach of the hockey team and the players did their best to rally around their coach.\nThe team got as much practice in before the first game as possible but still appeared disorganized against the Brunswick Canadians. Johnny Cogan was about the only player of the 15 used in the match who appeared ready to play and he ended up scoring both of the team's goals in the win. The Garnet then opened their state series against Bowdoin a few days later and looked much more prepared despite having several days off. Cogan led off the scoring but the Bobcats were unable to build on the early lead. Bowdoin tied the game in the second and, despite having several scoring opportunities, Bates was unable to regain the lead. The game required overtime and ended up being a bit slow in the first extra session before breaking out in the second. Cogan, who had been injured in the third period, led the offense for Bates but it was Bowdoin who managed to net the game-winner.\nThe next game came versus Colby and resulted in a very rough match. 14 penalties were called in the contest, which included fighting majors to both Maher and Lovett, but it was the sensational play of Irvine that stole the show. The Mules' netminder made 35 saves in the match and kept Colby in the game despite being outplayed throughout. The loss of Secor to a shoulder injury hamstrung the offense though Cogan was still able to score a pair of goals. After 2 scoreless overtime periods the match was declared a draw. A rematch with Bowdoin came a few days later with the score being identical to the first go-round. Cogan, again, provided the only goal for the Bobcats who had reordered their forward line to try and improve the offense. Anderson, a new entry for the team, played at right wing while Johnson was moved over to the left side. Secor, who still nursing his injury, had been dropped back to defense but none of those changes seemed to work.\nBates took its annual trip south the following week and came back with mixed results. Even with Zeke Secor's injury, the offense finally woke up against Army and Johnson's hat-trick led the team to a 5–0 demolition of the Cadets. Hopes that the team had turned the corner were dashed in the next game when the Garnet failed to get a single goal against the Mass Aggies. The team could only manage 11 shots in the game and ended up squandering another strong performance from first-year starter Topolosky and the defense.\nA return match with the Aggies ended up being the wildest game of the season. Cogan opened the scoring for Bates but the team was quickly buried under an avalanche of Aggie goals. down 1–4 at the start of the second, the Bobcats came roaring back with two goals from Johnson in the second and a trio of Cogan marker in the third. Having to devote their entire game to offense, Bates allowed two more scored and ended regulation ted at 6-all. UMass pulled ahead at the start of overtime and Bates was unable to get another tying goal, losing in heartbreaking fashion. The team then met Colby for an exhibition match but the game devolved into more of a street brawl. The referees allowed the overly-rough play to continue to a point that coach Wiggin could no longer abide. After leaving the ice for intermission, the Bobcats refused to return to the ice and the Mules were declared winners by default. Inconsistent goal scoring continued to plague Bates and the team was shutout by New Hampshire a few days later. Cogan and Johnson were visible throughout the game but were unable to crack the UNH defense. In an unfortunate turn of events, however, Cogan accidentally flipped the puck into his own cage while trying to clear the puck away and was credited with the winning goal.\nThe exam break paused the season afterwards and when the Bobcats reconvened they welcomed in several new players from the freshman team. Secor, now recovered enough to return to the team, was in fine form as was new entry McCluskey. Those two wingers combined with Cogan to completely dominate the game and lead the Bobcats to victory. The team was without Cogan in their meeting with MIT during the winter carnival but Farrell, who had taken over in goal from Topolosky after the exams, was a star in goal and kept the team in the game. With the team's newfound superiority and Cogan back in the lineup, the Bobcats downed Colby a few days later to take second place in the intrastate standings.\nThe final game of the season came against New Hampshire in a rematch. The Bobcats headed down to Durham and showed out far better than they had in the first meeting. McCluskey became the team's new star forward and led the way with a pair of goals as Bates ended the season on a high note.\nHoward Knight served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\nScoring statistics.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "Mark Thompson (American football)",
        "text": "Mark Thompson (born December 9, 1994) is an American football running back for the Houston Roughnecks of the United Football League (UFL).. He played college football at Dodge City and Florida and has also been a member of the Baltimore Ravens, New York Jets, Detroit Lions and Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League (NFL). He was named the USFL Offensive Player of the Year and made All-USFL for the 2023 USFL season.\nEarly life.\nThompson was born on December 9, 1994, in La Mott, Pennsylvania. He attended Cheltenham High School and played football and track, but was not highly recruited. He graduated as part of the class of 2013, but was not able to participate in the graduation event due to an incident at school, which also kept him from playing in the senior football all-star game and the track district championships.\nCollege career.\nThompson joined Nassau Community College after graduating from Cheltenham, but sensed it was not a good fit and transferred to Dodge City Community College before ever appearing in a game. In his first year with the Dodge City Conquistadors, he totaled 460 rushing yards on 84 carries with eight touchdowns. The following season, Thompson became one of the best running backs in junior college football as he ran for 1,298 yards on 268 attempts with 18 scores, tied for the third-most in the NJCAA. He set Dodge City's all-time career touchdowns record, was named an All-American and was ranked the number one junior college recruit at running back. He received numerous Division I offers and chose to play for the Florida Gators.\nPrior to the 2016 season, Thompson boldly predicted that he would rush for 1,000 yards by Florida's seventh game, against Georgia. By the time the Gators reached that game, Thompson had only rushed for 262 yards and two touchdowns, and he ended up missing the Georgia–Florida match after being suspended for marijuana possession. When he returned in their game against the South Carolina Gamecocks, he fumbled on his first carry. His ability to hold onto the football became a recurring issue during the season and he began holding one during his school classes to practice. Thompson's season ended on a high note, as he made an 85-yard receiving score during the Gators' Outback Bowl win over Iowa, setting the all-time record for longest catch in the game. He finished the year with 12 games played, four as a starter, and posted 68 carries for 299 yards with two rushing touchdowns.\nThompson had a slow start to his senior year, tallying just 33 rushes for 121 yards (an average of 3.7 yards-per-carry) through eight games, including two where he did not touch the ball once. After Randy Shannon became the interim head coach, Thompson began to see more action. In the final three games, he totaled 25 rush attempts for 176 yards, averaging more than seven yards-per-carry while scoring two of his three touchdowns on the year. He finished his senior season having appeared in all 11 games, while posting 58 carries for 297 yards (a 5.1 average), placing third on the team.\nProfessional career.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nPrior to the 2018 NFL Draft, Thompson worked out with the Atlanta Falcons. After going undrafted, he was signed by the Baltimore Ravens. In preseason, he ran 31 times for 146 yards and caught 10 passes for 76 yards. He was released at the final roster cuts. After having tryouts on September 4, September 5 and September 11, Thompson was re-signed by the Ravens to their practice squad on October 18, 2018. He was released from their practice squad on November 27, 2018.\nNew York Jets.\nThompson was signed to the practice squad of the New York Jets the following day after being released by Baltimore on November 28, 2018.\nDetroit Lions.\nThompson signed a reserve/future contract with the Detroit Lions at the conclusion of the 2018 season. Despite scoring multiple touchdowns in preseason, he was released at the final roster cuts in 2019. \nBaltimore Ravens (second stint).\nLater, on September 10, 2019, Thompson was signed to the practice squad of the Baltimore Ravens. He was placed on the practice squad/injured list on September 18, before being released on September 23, 2019. \nLas Vegas Raiders.\nIn January 2020, Thompson was signed by the Las Vegas Raiders to a reserve/future contract. He was waived on April 28, 2020. He had a tryout with the Carolina Panthers in September, but was not signed.\nHouston Gamblers / Roughnecks.\n2022.\nAfter being out of football for a year, Thompson was chosen in the 28th round (227th overall) of the 2022 USFL draft by the Houston Gamblers.

        "title": "Swimming with Sharks (Inga &amp; Anete Humpe album)",
        "text": "Swimming with Sharks is the second studio album by German duo Inga &amp; Anete Humpe, released in Europe by WEA in 1987. The album was released outside of Europe, including in the UK, US and Australia, in 1988. For the releases outside of Europe, the duo's name was changed to Swimming with Sharks. The album was released in the UK on 8 August 1988.\nCritical reception.\nUpon its release in Europe in 1987, \"Music &amp; Media\" praised the album as a worthy follow-up to their \"critically acclaimed first release\" and added that the new album \"should satisfy even the highest expectations\". They continued, \"The songs are strong, Volker's production is excellent (and reminiscent of Kate Bush's \"Hounds of Love\") and their voices always charming and engaging.\" In the UK, Paul Mathur of \"Melody Maker\" noted the album's \"rather lovably gawky simplicity\" may hamper its commercial chances, but added \"there's much to recommend, particularly when the sisters move away from their sometimes rather rigid structures and let those aquamarine voices out into the open seas\". He praised \"Careless Love\", \"No Longer Friends\", \"Sweet Sadness\" and \"Holy Johnny\" for being \"heavy with a certain tattered emotion\" and added that they are the tracks which work \"most appealingly\".\nSimon Williams of \"NME\" noted that \"inter-continental influences are much in evidence\" across the album, citing ABBA as one of the biggest, with \"No Long Friends\" being \"a deadringer\" for \"The Winner Takes It All\" and \"Duet Alone\" being \"uncannily similar\" to \"The Day Before You Came\". He praised the \"gorgeously impalpable harmonies\" and added, \"Seductive and sensual, when Swimming with Sharks breathe over the turntable, they make underwater romping the most attractive proposition in the entire known world.\" Although most of the songs \"detail finished/crumbling relationships\", Williams felt that the duo could not \"sustain such melodrama over a whole album\" as heard on the single \"Careless Love\". He was critical of the \"unsympathetic programming\", with Volker having \"copie[d] every naff synth effect pioneered by ELO ten years ago\". Paul Taylor of the \"Manchester Evening News\" remarked that with their two singles, \"Careless Love\" and \"No Longer Friends\", the sisters \"suggested a desire to plug the gap left by ABBA as Euro-wide pop principals and all-round nice guys\", particularly as they had chosen to sing in English, which Taylor said is \"seemingly the international language of pop\". He commented that \"there's a good deal more to this album than the cunning hooks and sparkling production of those singles\" and praised it for being of \"more contrasts and greater adventurousness than you might expect\".\nIn the US, \"Billboard\" described \"Swimming with Sharks\" as \"occasionally enticing synth-pop\" and added that the duo \"manages to vault the inherent limitations of a spare style with such attractive tunes as 'No Longer Friends' and 'Sweet Sadness,' sung with proper teutonic cool\". Bob Thompson of the Canadian paper \"Terrace Standard\" stated, \"Take some brisk Euro-disco, throw in cooing vocals and lots of lyrical posturing and you have Swimming with Sharks. In the end, [the duo] sounds like the cabaret Bangles with a sultry opinion of themselves.\"\nPersonnel.\nAdditional musicians\nProduction\nOther"

        "text": "The 1922–23 Bates men's ice hockey season was the 4th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAfter the departure of coach Watkins in the offseason, the Bate hockey team was on its third head coach in just 4 years. The program turned to alumnus and former goaltender Carleton Wiggin who was also the head coach of the football team. At the start of the season, the team had an ambitious slate of 14 games arranged with a few more possibly in the works. Leading the team was 4-year player Eddie Roberts, who was expected to take charge on offense while the defense sorted itself out. Carl Rounds graduation was compounded by the loss of Bob Partridge in goal with the latter leaving school early. With the entire defense side needing work, Dick Stanley, who had played wing last year, was dropped back onto the blueline to head the defensive corps.\nThe first game for the team came in mid-January against Colby, who had now formally joined their CBB brethren in ice hockey. With a bit more experience as a varsity team, Bates was on the attack for most of the game and were able to skate rings around the defensive-minded Mules. Despite Stanley playing defense for the entire game, he was at the forefront of the offense and helped Bates earn a 5–0 win. A few days later, Bates took on St. Dominique's and had an impossible time scoring against the defensive squad. The only goal of the game was scored midway through the second but, unfortunately, the score was from the opposition. Roberts led a valiant effort to get the tying goal in the third but ultimately came up short. After their first loss, the team responded by completely trouncing Bowdoin 12–1, with Roberts and Cogan each netting hat-tricks goals leading the pack. The Garnet outshot the Bears 47–6 and were in control for the entire 45 minute match.\nBates' offense kept rolling in the next two games and flattened a pair of amateur clubs 11–3. The wide margins and relative unimportance of the outcomes allowed coach Wiggin to play many alternates in the games and ensure he had two units of players who knew what to do for the games ahead. In the Augusta game, however, the team was hit by the injury bug when Dick Stanley was forced to leave early and missed the following match. Despite the loss of their top defenseman, Roberts was able to put up 10 goals in the two games to lead the club.\nThe first big test of the season came with the team firing on all cylinders when they hit to the road to take on Army. Poor weather saw the rink covered in slush and snow that slowed the game and made any kind of teamwork nearly impossible. Roberts and Cogan each scored on individual plays and those two markers were enough to give the Garnet the win. The team continued its road trip by travelling to face Princeton and the game ended up going about as bad for Bates as possible. The Tiger sextet put up 6 goals in the first period and took control of the match. A further 3 goals in the middle period made it nearly impossible for the Garnet to mount a comeback but that didn't stop them from trying. Princeton used alternates for the third period but, despite employing a secondary unit, Bates was still unable to score a single goal. To add injury to insult, Cogan went down with a badly twisted ankle and his availability for the rest of the season was in question.\nthe exam break gave the team time to rest and recover from the loss and their various ailments and try to get back on the winning side in early-February when they reconvened. Unfortunately, a scarlet fever epidemic meant that the players were forced to stay away and cancel their first return game. The team had hardly any practice time ahead of the match with Maine and were unable to cope with the loss of Cogan, who was still nursing his ankle. Corey provided the only goal for the Garnet, who lost the Augusta Winter Sports Carnival title. A week later, the team faced Bowdoin in a rematch and the lack of ice time over the previous several weeks showed. Even with Cogan back in the lineup, the sluggish Garnet were outskated in the first period but did eventually get their legs beneath them. Despite having three goals disallowed, Bates was still able to take the match 3–1 and keep the hope of the state championship alive.\nIn the final event of the Auburn Winter Carnival, Boston University gave the Garnet a rude awakening with a 0–6 defeat. Despite outshooting the Bostonians, Cogan's bum ankle put the team at a disadvantage and unable to get the puck past the scarlet goaltender. The next match was a return game against Maine and would decide the state championship. The Orono boys were a match for Bates and the game see-sawed back and forth with neither able to get away from the other. The two teams were tied at 4-all at the end of regulation and agreed to play two 5-minute overtime periods to decide the winner. With just a minute left in the second extra period, Joe Cogan notched his second marker of the game and won the Pine Tree title for the Garnet. A few days later the team finished out its season with another 5-goal win over Colby, posting the best campaign in the history of the young program.\nFrederick Noyes served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1925–26 Bates men's ice hockey season was the 7th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAs the season began, Bates was looking to recover from its worst performance but were not able to get any ice time in until New Year's. While there were many returning players, the team had missed the entire second half of the season due to a lack of ice and improving teamwork was a priority for coach Wiggin. Junie Stanley, who had been elected team captain after last season was no longer enrolled at Bates. The team would have to overcome his loss while Dave Wyllie assumed the mantle of leadership.\nThe Bobcats' first game came after just 9 days of practice against a veteran team from Bowdoin. The Garnet did their best but they were outmatched by the Polar Bears and sunk 0–3. The score could have been much worse but Wyllie did well in goal as the team was outshot 17–36. Al Lane nearly scored for Bates but the puck entered the net just after the second period had expired. The team then prepared for a 3-game road trip south and met Williams first. The Ephs had already dropped Yale twice and proved their superiority by throttling the Bobcats 0–13. After the worst loss in program history, Bates rebounded against Union. Though they lost the game, their performance was far better and the final score was a respectable 2–4. A day later the team had to contend with poor ice at Army but were still nearly able to pull out a win.\nDespite losing all their games to that point, the steady improvement of the team gave hope that they could finish strong and vie for the state championship. They faced a shorthanded Bowdoin club in a rematch a week later but weren't able to take advantage. Wyllie played brilliantly, allowing just 1 goal in the match, but Bates was unable to score at all and lost their chance at a championship. Just before the exam break, Bates played host to New Hampshire and finally ended their losing streak. After losing 10 in a row, dating back to last season, Wyllie posted a shutout to lead the team to victory.\nAfter a 2-week break for exams, Bates returned to the ice in mid-February and took on MIT. The lineup was reshuffled for the game with Lane moved to wing along with White while Foster took over at center. The new forward line provided nearly as much offense as the team had seen all season and popped in 5 goals for the Bobcats. Every score was needed against the Engineers, who netted 4 of their own, but a late goal by Foster gave the team their second win on the season. A third win by Bowdoin ensured the Polar Bears a state championship in the middle of the week but didn't deter the Bobcats from finishing strong. Because an earlier game against Colby had been postponed, the two agreed to play a doubleheader but that too was delayed until the 22nd. The first game Bates got off to a tremendous start by scored four times in the first period with White and Foster each in on two of those goals. The game slowed afterwards and that appeared to suit the Mules as Colby scored twice in the middle period. The pace picked up in the third but that didn't stop the comeback bid and Bates soon had its lead down to just a single goal. Wyllie stood tall in the final minutes, however, and enabled Bates to eke out a win. The second match was much tighter between the two and they finished regulation tied at 1-all. Foster put the team ahead in the first overtime period but it only took a couple of minutes for Colby to tie the game once more. After that the teams, who were visibly tired after an entire day of playing one another, were unable to get another goal. The match went to 4 overtime periods but nothing could be decided. After a total of 72 minutes, the games was called a draw and allowed Bates to claim the runner-up spot for the state championship.\nStanley Stuber served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "2023 CONCACAF Nations League final",
        "text": "The 2023 CONCACAF Nations League final was a soccer match between Canada and the United States to determine the winner of the 2022–23 CONCACAF Nations League's top division, League A. The match was the second final match of the CONCACAF Nations League, an international tournament contested by the men's national teams of CONCACAF, covering North America, Central America, and the Caribbean. It was played on June 18, 2023, at Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada, United States, in the Las Vegas area, which had hosted the finals tournament.\nThe United States won the final 2–0 to secure a second consecutive CONCACAF Nations League title, with goals from Chris Richards and Folarin Balogun in the first half. U.S. midfielder Giovanni Reyna was named man of the match for his two assists. Canada finished as runners-up in their first Nations League final, which was also their first CONCACAF tournament final since the 2000 Gold Cup.\nVenue.\nThe 2023 final was played at Allegiant Stadium, an indoor stadium in the Las Vegas-area community of Paradise, Nevada in the United States. The 65,000-seat stadium, primarily home to the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League, had a retractable grass surface and was designed to accommodate soccer. The entire Nations League Finals tournament was hosted at Allegiant Stadium with two sets of doubleheaders for both rounds. It was the second CONCACAF tournament final at the stadium, following the 2021 Gold Cup final. The entire 2023 Nations League Finals was played at Allegiant Stadium.\nRoute to final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away; N: neutral).\"\nCanada.\nIn the inaugural edition of the Nations League, Canada had been unseeded and qualified for League A after playing through a qualification tournament. They finished second in their League A group behind the United States, tying on points but losing on goal differential. Canada also qualified for the 2021 Gold Cup, where they again finished second to the United States in the group stage but advanced; in the tournament's semi-finals, they lost to Mexico in stoppage time.\nFor the 2022–23 Nations League, Canada remained in League A and were drawn into Group C alongside Honduras and Curaçao. The team's players were involved in a pay dispute with the Canada Soccer Association and refused to play in a pre-Nations League friendly, but confirmed they would play in the tournament to prevent sanctions. During the June window, they defeated Curaçao 4–0 at home in Vancouver with two goals from Alphonso Davies and lost 2–1 on the road to Honduras. Following their appearance in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Canada returned to Nations League play in March 2023 with a 2–0 defeat of Curaçao in Willemstad; Jonathan David and Cyle Larin both scored in the first half against the home side, who had a player sent off with a second yellow card. They were tied with Honduras on points and ahead on goal difference; the two teams would play each other in the final matchday. Canada secured their first semifinal berth with a 4–1 victory in Toronto as Larin scored twice and extended his lead as the country's top international goalscorer.\nCanada qualified for their first Nations League final with a 2–0 win against Panama in the semifinals. They took the lead in the 25th minute with David's shot through goalkeeper Orlando Mosquera's legs; Davies, who had been recovering from an earlier thigh injury, scored the team's second goal in the 69th minute shortly after entering the match as substitute. The Nations League final was their first CONCACAF tournament final since the 2000 Gold Cup, which they won.\nUnited States.\nThe United States were the defending champions of the Nations League and Gold Cup, having won both tournaments in 2021 against long-time rivals Mexico. They were drawn into Group D of League A alongside El Salvador and Grenada, both of whom had been promoted from League B. The United States had secured a World Cup berth—their first since 2014—and 19 players from the qualifiers were called up during the June window for the Nations League and two friendlies. Several key players, including goalkeeper Matt Turner, midfielder Weston McKennie, defender Sergiño Dest, and forward Gio Reyna, were excluded from the roster while they recovered from injuries; among their replacements were Major League Soccer (MLS) players and newcomer dual-nationals from European leagues.\nThe Americans opened their defense of the Nations League title with a 5–0 victory over Grenada in Austin, Texas, with four goals from Jesús Ferreira and one from Paul Arriola—both FC Dallas players. Their second match, on a muddy pitch at Estadio Cuscatlán in San Salvador, ended as a 1–1 draw with El Salvador following a stoppage time header from Jordan Morris. Both teams had a player sent off earlier with red cards. Head coach Gregg Berhalter was replaced by interim manager Anthony Hudson as the United States returned to Nations League play after the World Cup. Their 7–1 win in Grenada included two goals from Christian Pulisic, two from McKennie, and one from debutant Alejandro Zendejas. The team finished their group stage play by defeating El Salvador 1–0 in Orlando to top Group D with 10 points; Ricardo Pepi scored the lone goal of the match shortly after entering as a substitute.\nHudson was replaced in May 2023 by former Berhalter assistant B. J. Callaghan, who would make his debut as interim head coach in the Nations League Finals' semifinal round against Mexico. Callaghan called up a squad of players from European clubs, choosing to limit their playing time to the Nations League Finals and give them a longer break instead of reusing the same roster for the Gold Cup. The United States earned a 3–0 victory against Mexico in the semifinal, which extended an unbeaten streak against their rivals to six matches. Pulisic scored late in the first half and in the opening minute of the second half before skirmishes broke out between players. Pepi added a third goal that was initially flagged as offside but granted following video review. Four players were shown red cards, including McKennie and Dest, and the match ended prematurely in stoppage time due to homophobic chants.\nBroadcasting.\nThe Nations League final was broadcast on television in the United States on Univision and TUDN in Spanish. It was carried in English on Paramount+, an online streaming service, with coverage provided by CBS Sports. The Canadian broadcast was produced by online streaming service OneSoccer and simulcast on Telus Optik TV.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe United States entered the final missing several players: McKennie and Dest were suspended, while Miles Robinson was out injured. Callaghan named Joe Scally and Walker Zimmerman to replace Dest and Robinson in the backline, while Brendan Aaronson would replace McKennie in the midfield. It was the youngest-ever lineup for the United States in a tournament final, with an average age of 23 years, 314 days. Canada's starting lineup had two changes from the semifinal against Panama: defender Scott Kennedy replaced Steven Vitória; and midfielder Jonathan Osorio started in place of Tajon Buchanan.\nCanada began the match with the majority of possession, but were vulnerable to counter-attacks from the United States. The first goal of the final came from a Reyna corner in the 12th minute that was headed in by Chris Richards from close range. Folarin Balogun—who had recently joined the United States team—missed a header from a set-piece in the 28th minute but scored the team's second goal in the 34th minute. A turnover at midfield allowed Reyna to receive the ball and pass it forward into Balogun's run into the box. A few minutes later, Canada had two chances to score that forced a pair of saves from Matt Turner and a clearance from Antonee Robinson. Richards and Balogun both recorded their first international goals, becoming the first U.S. players to score their debut goal in a tournament final. The United States entered half-time with a 2–0 lead.\nReyna was replaced by Luca de la Torre at half-time due to injury concerns after being tackled by Alistair Johnston in stoppage time. The United States continued to put pressure on Canada and had two chances to score a third goal: Richards collected a misplayed clearance and his header hit the crossbar in the 55th minute; it was quickly followed by a shot by Balogun off a corner kick that was blocked off the line by Kennedy. John Herdman brought on two defenders, as well as Buchanan, in the 61st minute for Canada to change the team's shape as they continued to have the majority of possession but few chances to score; the team's 10 shots were all from outside the penalty area. Cyle Larin missed two chances to score for Canada in the 67th minute—a low shot that was blocked and a follow-up that went over the crossbar. The United States later moved to a three-man defense to close out the match, which ended in a 2–0 victory. Reyna was named man of the match for his first-half performance.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules\nPost-match.\nThe United States clinched their second consecutive Nations Leagues title and ninth international trophy; as winners of the competition, they also won a $1 million cash prize for the tournament. A month after taking over as interim head coach, Callaghan won his first trophy; he remained as head coach until Berhalter's return after the 2023 Gold Cup. With the victory, the United States also extended their home unbeaten streak against Canada to 22 matches, with their most recent loss in 1957 during qualifiers for the 1958 FIFA World Cup.\nAtiba Hutchinson, Canada's captain, retired from international soccer after the match—his 104th appearance for the national team. Herdman attributed Canada's defeat to their lack of resources, as they only had four days to prepare for the tournament due to the financial issues that the Canada Soccer Association faced."

        "title": "1921–22 Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1921–22 Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey season was the 5th season of play for the program. The Eagles were coached by Fred Rocque in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nAfter two fantastic seasons, Boston College was expected to do even better in 1922 with their captain, Leo Hughes, now recovered from a knee injury that had hampered him all of last season. Rather than wait until January for the team to begin, the Eagles kicked off the year with a few preliminary games in December. The team looked a bit slow against St. Paul's School but the defense was good enough to lead them to victory.\nOver the Christmas break, the Eagles joined three other teams for an exhibition at the Boston Arena. Boston College could hardly have played worse in the first game, looking like a collection of individuals rather than a team. The BC boys lost to a high school team from Montreal and were so chastised by the result that they redoubled their efforts in the second game. McGill was one of the best college teams in Canada and while they finished their residency with an unblemished record, the Eagles gave them the toughest fight of their trip.\nThe Eagles tried to work on their issues leading into the first intercollegiate match with MIT, but weren't quite up to par when the game started. BC found itself down 0–2 after a sluggish first but the Eagles quickly picked up the slack in the middle frame and scored three unanswered goals to escape with a win. Boston College then got into a fight with another high school team, this time from Melrose. The Eagles were hamstrung by injuries and used mostly reserves in the game which led to a more even match. In the brief time when starters were on the ice, BC got its only goal of the game and ended regulation tied at 1-all. Due to the impending game with Yale, the two sides agreed to forgo overtime with the possibility of playing the game off later. The Bulldogs arrived two days later in the midst of a down season (by their standards) but were still a dangerous club. The Eagles took no chances and slew the Eli dragon with a 7–0 shellacking. Hughes, Curry and Donnellan, who had all been injured prior to the game, showed no signs of impairment and ran roughshod over the Yale defense. \nAfter the stunning win, the Eagles were regarded as a potential championship club, however, they had little chance left to make an impact. While undefeated in intercollegiate play, BC had only played two matches and both were against teams with middling records. BC had just one game left on its schedule against a fellow college, a rematch with MIT, that would hardly improve their standing. If the non-college games were included, BC would have even less of a chance at a championship as they team had not fared particularly well in those contests. While they got ready to face the Boston Athletic Association, the Eagles set about trying to get additional games added to their slate but, at this late of a date, that was all but impossible. After losing to the semi-pro team, BC vastly outplayed the Engineers in the rematch.\nWith their season now complete, the team had pretentions (perhaps unjustified) about being championship-worth as they had defeated all collegiate opponents. Harvard was the only other school to boast such a claim, however, the Crimson had also tied the B.A.A. and defeated St. Paul's School 9–1 while also going 3–0 against Yale and MIT. Harvard had a stronger case for the title and were proclaimed by many as the Intercollegiate champions. However, the two captains on the teams, Hughes and George Owen, had played together on the ice hockey team at Newton High School. They were able to come to an arrangement to play one another at the end of the season, but there was a caveat. Harvard would only play an exhibition match, meaning the Crimson would not risk losing the claim for the championship. With no recourse, the Eagles agreed to the terms and met Harvard in early March. To ensure the unofficial status of the game, three of Harvard's regulars (Owen, Higgins and Walker) did not participate and were replaced by players who were members of the freshman team. Harvard dubbed the group the 'Crimson Ramblers'. However, even with the Crimson short-handed, BC was not able to overcome Harvard in regulation. Before a packed crowd at the Boston Arena, Boston College fought a defensive struggle against Harvard and took a narrow lead into the third period. A desperate big for a goal in the waning moments succeeded and Harvard forced overtime. The third period exertions appeared to sap the strength from the Ramblers and BC was able to score twice in the two extra periods. Though victorious, the win was a hollow one for the Eagles as it didn't stop Harvard from not only claiming the championship but being viewed as the better team.\nRalph Shea served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 2023–24 Clemson Tigers men's basketball team represented Clemson University during the 2023–24 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Tigers were led by 14th-year head coach Brad Brownell and played their home games at Littlejohn Coliseum in Clemson, South Carolina as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nThe Tigers began the season with nine straight wins. This included a one-point win over UAB and a three-point win over Davidson to claim the Asheville Championship. They continued their strong start to the season, upsetting twenty-third ranked Alabama in the ACC–SEC Challenge. They opened the ACC season with a nine-point win at Pittsburgh. They debuted in the national rankings at twenty-fourth before their rivalry game with South Carolina. They won that game and their ensuing game against TCU for their ninth win of the season. After the win, they achieved their highest ranking during the season of thirteenth. Their first defeat was by two-points against Memphis on December 16, 2023. They won their final two non-conference games to finish their non-conference season 10–1. Their non-conference success did not carry into the start of their ACC season as they lost four of their first five games. A loss to Miami (FL) and eigtht-ranked North Carolina dropped them to twenty-first in the rankings. Despite defeating Boston College and losing to Virginia Tech, the Tigers fell out of the rankings. A double-overtime loss to Georgia Tech capped the first five games. The Tigers won five of their next seven games, including only their second ever win at North Carolina. They lost by a point at twelfth-ranked Duke and also by a point to Virginia. They Tigers won four of their last six games including the completeion of a season sweep against Pittsburgh and Florida State. They ended the season with a loss to Wake Forest. After the season, Ian Schieffelin was named ACC Most Improved Player, becoming the second Clemson player to win the award. PJ Hall was named to the All-ACC First Team.\nThe Tigers finished the season 24–12 and 11–9 in ACC play to finish in a three-way tie for fifth place. As the sixth seed in the ACC tournament, were defeated by Boston College in the Second Round. They earned an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament and were placed as the sixth-seed in the West region. They defeated eleventh-seed New Mexico in the First Round, third-seed Baylor in the Second Round and second-seed Arizona in the Sweet Sixteen. This advanced Clemson to only their second Elite Eight in program history. In the Elite Eight the Tigers lost in a rematch of an early season game against Alabama 82–89 to end their season.\nPrevious season.\nThe Tigers finished the 2022–23 season 23–11, 14–6 in ACC play, in a three-way tie for third place. As the third seed in the ACC tournament, they earned a bye into the Quarterfinals where they defeated sixth seed NC State for the third time during the season. They fell to second seeded Virginia in the semifinals. They were not selected for the NCAA tournament and were listed as the fourth team out on Selection Sunday. They received a first overall seed in the National Invitation Tournament. Despite being the first seed, and hosting, the Tigers lost to Morehead State in the first round to end their season.\nClemson started the season 6–0 in ACC play, for the first time since the ACC was created as a conference. Their previous best was in the 1996–97 season when they started 5–0. The Tigers continued their run by defeating Duke but then lost to Wake Forest to end their undefeated run. They won their next two games and were 9–1 at the halfway point of the conference season. This gave the team its best six, seven, eight, nine and ten game starts in conference history. The Tigers would set another program record on February 15, 2023, when they defeated Florida State 94–54 at home. This was the Tigers' widest margin of victory in ACC play, beating the previous record of a 34-point win in 1975.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|ACC tournament\n!colspan=9 style=|NCAA tournament\nSource\nStatistics.\nSource:"

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career double plays as a left fielder leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, a double play (denoted as DP) is the act of making two outs during the same continuous play. One double play is recorded for every defensive player who participates in the play, regardless of how many of the outs in which they were directly involved, and is counted in addition to whatever putouts and assists might also apply. Double plays can occur any time there is at least one baserunner and fewer than two outs. The left fielder (LF) is one of the three outfielders, the defensive positions in baseball farthest from the batter. Left field is the area of the outfield to the left of a person standing at home plate and facing toward the pitcher's mound. The outfielders have to try to catch long fly balls before they hit the ground or to quickly catch or retrieve and return to the infield any other balls entering the outfield. The left fielder must also be adept at navigating the area of left field where the foul line approaches the corner of the playing field and the walls of the seating areas. Being the outfielder closest to third base, the left fielder generally does not have to throw as far as the other outfielders to throw out runners advancing around the bases, so they often do not have the strongest throwing arm, but their throws need to be accurate. The left fielder normally plays behind the third baseman and shortstop, who play in or near the infield; unlike catchers and most infielders (excepting first basemen), who are virtually exclusively right-handed, left fielders can be either right- or left-handed. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the left fielder is assigned the number 7.\nLeft fielders are most commonly credited with a double play when they throw the ball to an infielder who tags a runner attempting to advance on the basepaths, even on a caught fly ball that results in an out (see tag up); of special importance are throws to the catcher if the runner is trying to reach home plate to score a run, perhaps on a sacrifice fly. Left fielders will often record assists by throwing out runners who try to advance farther than the batter, such as going from first to third base on a single, or batter/runners who try to stretch a hit into a longer one. Outfielders also earn double plays on relay throws to infielders after particularly deep fly balls, by throwing to a base to record an out on an appeal play, or in situations where they might deflect a fly ball before another defensive player makes the catch; in extraordinary instances, right fielders have occasionally recorded double plays by throwing out batters at first base after fielding uncaught line drives that reached them quickly. Outfielders record far fewer double plays than other players due to the difficulty of making an accurate throw in time to retire a runner from a great distance; middle infielders routinely record more double plays in a single season than outfielders do in their entire careers. Double plays are an important statistic for outfielders, giving a greater indication of a left fielder's throwing arm than double plays by infielders do. In recent years, some sabermetricians have begun referring to assists by outfielders as baserunner kills.\nJimmy Sheckard is the all-time leader in career double plays as a left fielder with 58. Zack Wheat (50) is the only other left fielder who has recorded 50 career double plays. Michael Brantley, who had 24 double plays through the 2023 season to place him tied for 99th all-time, is the leader among active players."

        "text": "The 1927–28 Bates men's ice hockey season was the 9th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nBefore the start of the season, the team took a hit because John Cogan was academically ineligible. Fortunately, the team returned many players from last year's squad and had some experience to rely upon in his absence. The team opened the season with a win against an amateur club with Zeke Secor having a hand in all three goals. The team then embarked on its annual trip south and came up with a pair of 2–0 wins. Bob Violette was the star of the star of the team to that point, not having allowed a single goal through the first three games to set a new program record.\nBates finally surrendered its first goal of the season to Bowdoin but the offensive unit of Foster, White and Secor came through once more to lead the team to victory. By the time the team met Colby, they were playing their fourth game in eight days and were unable to sustain their winning streak. Despite the best efforts of the Mules, however, the Bobcats wouldn't go away. Secor's goal in the third sent the game into overtime and it took 4 extra periods before Colby could net the winner. The loss heralded a down period of the season for Bates as the Garnet lost the next two games as well. The team wasn't quite able to stand up to the attack from New Hampshire and allowed 5 goals to the Wildcats but the worst came when they lost the rematch to Colby in another overtime thriller. The second loss to the Mules meant that Bates would not be able to win a state championship. Just before the break, Bates welcomed the Aggies for a return match and were able to end their 3-game losing skid.\nCogan was successful during the exam break and rejoined the team after becoming eligible once more. He hit the ice just in time for the team's game against Yale, the best team in the nation. Foster dropped back to defense, giving Cogan the spot at center. This allowed Cogan to score his first goal of the season however, while Secor secured 2 more, the Bobcats were hopelessly outgunned by the Bulldogs and fell 3–12. The team returned home and found a group of Canadians waiting for them in the form of Acadia. The unfamiliar foes were mostly even as they battled through a fast game. Johnny Cogan bookended the scoring that finished up 2-all after regulation. Two overtime periods went by without another marker and the game was called a draw. A week later, weather hampered the rematch with Bowdoin. An early thaw caused the ice to become soft and slow which made skating rather difficult. Only one goal was scored in the game and it came from the stick of a Polar Bear. The loss placed Bates at the bottom of the state rankings and gave the Garnet a terrible result despite an otherwise strong season.\nBates ended is season on a high note, however, as the team travelled down to Providence and came away with a 4–2 win. Cogan was the individual star of the game and helped the team post a winning record for the second straight year.\nLeon Grant served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1927–28 YMCA College Maroons men's ice hockey season was the 21st season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nWhile things seemed good at the outset, trouble was brewing for the program. The team was able to retain the services of Frank Carroll as coach while he also served as the bench boss for the Springfield Indians. While the hope of stability was lost due to the collapse of the New England Intercollegiate Hockey League, YMCA was able to work out a deal to use the West Side Arena for their home games. Unfortunately, with high demand for ice time, the Maroons weren't able to get much practice time at the Arena. A lack of a local rink combined with a warm winter caused the team to have very little in the way of on-ice practices leading into the season.\nIn part due to the dearth of ice, YMCA opened their season in late January with a game against Holy Cross. The Maroons played well in the game but were outclassed by a faster team. Unable to keep up with the Crusaders, YMCA couldn't generate much offense and were shutout by the purple invaders. YMCA continued to show improvement when they hit the road for the first time. Williams, who had easily beaten the Maroons the year before, needed to fend off a furious attack in the final period. After the Ephs had built a 3-goal lead, the offense finally began to show signs of life when Johnson fired a pass from team captain Crowell into the net. A few minutes later Crowell put his team within one and sent Williams scrambling to hold onto their lead. Unfortunately for YMCA, the final buzzer sounded before they could get the tying goal. Both the offense and defense showed up in the next game at Brown. While liting the BEars to just one goal, the Maroons caged two in the second in quick succession and then hung on desperately to earn their first win of the season. Al Lang was the hero of the game, turning aside a bevy of shots in the third period to preserve the lead.\nThe following week the team played host to New Hampshire and swiftly found themselves down by 3 goals. Johnson was able to cut into the lead and stop the bleeding but after exchanging two more goals, the Maroons were still down by a pair. The Wildcats were able to play a solid defensive game for the final two periods and stop all but one shot from YMCA, a third goal from Johnson. the Maroons then took a short jaunt to Amherst and were locked into a close battle with the Lord Jeffs all evening. The Dinty Flint scored in the second to match an earlier goal from the Sabrinas and neither team was able to add to their totals in the third. A 10-minute overtime was arranged but resulted in no goals. A second was institutes but that turned out bad for the Maroons. Cameron, the Amherst captain, scored to give his team the lead and then added a second marker about 5 minutes later. Nothing that YMCA tried found its was into the cage and the Maroons lost in heartbreaking fashion.\nOnce again, the final match of the year came against Rensselaer and ended with a 2–0 score. Wilbur Johnson remained the top offensive threat for the Maroons, scoring both goals to give his team the win. Unfortunately, the win turned out to be the last for a long time for the college as the ice hockey program was shuttered after the season. Due to the lack of available ice, the team was mothballed for the better part of a decade and wouldn't return until 1936.\nR. W. Miller served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The Sharks represent Long Island University and are coached by Brett Riley, in his 4th season.\nSeason.\nWhile LIU was hoping to take the next step in their fourth season, the team was still largely unable to move forward. Long Island's start to the season looked promising as they played two close games against ranked opponents (both losses) and produced some good offense against Stonehill, that pattern didn't change throughout the year. The Sharks got a solid effort from starter Brandon Perrone throughout the season but it wasn't quite good enough to overcome decent teams. Similarly, the offense produced consistently; Josh Zary became the first LIU player to hit 20 goals for a season and the Sharks had five skaters with at least 30 points. However, the team came up just shy too often, losing eight games by 1 goal. LIU's numbers were offset by the eight games the team had against Stonehill, the worst team in college hockey. In those matches, Long Island went 8–0 and scored 48 goals while allowing just 12. The season series with the Skyhawks enabled LIU to set a program record with 16 wins but still left them sitting near the bottom of the PairWise rankings.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 2002 World Cup qualification's United States v Jamaica on October 7, 2001 was an association football (soccer) match between the United States and Jamaica, with the winner qualifying for the 2002 FIFA World Cup held in South Korea and Japan. The United States won the game 2–1, qualifying for the World Cup that year.\nBackground.\nLeading to the game, both the United States and Jamaica still had some chances to qualify. However, neither two teams were on the top three at the time, with the United States falling behind Mexico by goal differences even though both had 13 points; while Jamaica had a very slim chance to qualify with only 8 points. This match became very important due to the match being their ninth encounter. Jamaica came to this match with a pressure that they had no choice but to win the game, or they would be eliminated. Meanwhile, the U.S. needed to win while hoping that Honduras would fail to Trinidad and Tobago to reclaim a spot in top three. At the time of the match, both teams had shown some level of success in CONCACAF tournaments, but had struggled heavily at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Jamaica lost 3–1 to Croatia and 5–0 to Argentina before getting a 2–1 win against Japan. The United States lost all of their matches against Germany (2–0), Iran (2–1), and Yugoslavia (1–0) and finished last in the tournament.\nThe match came after almost a month following the deadly September 11 attacks which claimed 3,000 lives; a win would have been noted for reinvigorating American patriotism.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe United States and Jamaica marked a minute in memory to the victims of the tragic September 11 attacks. The match eventually started under supervision of the Salvadoran referee. The first half started with a surprising quick attack by the United States, which allowed them to have a free kick after Chris Armas was fouled by veteran Theodore Whitmore on the left side. Claudio Reyna sent a free kick toward the near post. A diving Joe-Max Moore headed the ball past goalkeeper Aaron Lawrence from six yards for an early 1–0 edge, sending fans to celebration. Landon Donovan and Max-Moore had chances to double tally, but failed. The U.S. lead didn't last long, just ten minutes later, Jamie Lawrence took advantage with a passing ball from teammate and poor defending of the U.S. to level it 1–1. After that, the U.S. increased pressure on Jamaica, but a solid defense by the Jamaicans prevented the Americans from regaining the lead, as the first half ended one-all.\nThe second half saw the U.S. almost had a chance to take the lead again in 47', but Max-Moore was denied by A. Lawrence. Whitmore tried to breakthrough American defense in 52', but his final shot was too light and Brad Friedel didn't face any pressure. Donovan tried his luck with a long-range shot in 57', to no avail. As the deadlock was yet to be broken, the U.S. received a warming new as Stern John delivered a goal for Trinidad and Tobago against Honduras in 61', meant that the U.S. had a chance to win. The U.S. increased pressure from the moment Trinidad and Tobago delivered the Americans an advantage, but it was not until 81' when Tyrone Marshall fouled Donovan in the penalty area. Max-Moore successfully converted it to 2–1, and the U.S. managed to hold it until the end of the game to seal the United States a needed victory, with luck on their side as well as Honduras suffered a shock home loss to Trinidad and Tobago and Costa Rica held Mexico goalless.\nPost-match.\n&lt;noinclude&gt;\nThis win was considered to be significant emotionally to Americans due to the close proximity of the match and the September 11 attacks. However, news coverage of the match was heavily overshadowed by the United States invasion of Afghanistan, which happened on the same day.\nThe United States eventually reached the 2002 FIFA World Cup, thanked for a goalless draw in Trinidad and Tobago. Meanwhile, Jamaica fell in their final game against Costa Rica at home soil. In the 2002 World Cup, the United States enjoyed its a string of victories totaling to its best performance at the World Cup ever since winning bronze at the 1930 tournament; the US eventually would lose to runners-up Germany in the quarter-finals.\nIt was also the last soccer game to be held in Foxboro Stadium (that hosted matches of the 1994 FIFA World Cup). In January 2002, the old stadium was demolished following the completion of Gillette Stadium nearby."

        "text": "The 1921–22 Minnesota Gophers men's ice hockey season was the inaugural season of play for the program. The Gophers represented the University of Minnesota and were coached by I. D. McDonald in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nAfter several years of fielding a club team, the University of Minnesota decided to form a varsity ice hockey program in 1921. So popular was the sport that the school promoted the team to 'major' status before playing a single game. While the committee initially decided not to award athletic letters for the players, they left the final decision up to \"M\" committee and allowed them to overrule the initial decree if they decided that the status of the team would warrant such an action. In the meantime, candidates for the team gathered at the Armory for practice while the field outside was flooded for the rink. While all of this was going on, the team still did not have a head coach. Several names had been put forth including Kaler and McPherson from the local Minneapolis team as well as Archibald, who had served as the team's coach last season. While those choices were mulled over, Bill Taylor was tabbed as the team's manager and games with Wisconsin and Michigan College of Mines were tentavely arranged. Just before the winter break, I. D. McDonald (misreported as F. D. McDonald), a well-regarded Canadian player who had served as a referee in the area for several years was chosen as the program's first coach. Additionally, the team was able to secure the use of the Hippodrome Rink at the state fairgrounds for their home games but, after a rethink, decided to play at Lexington Park instead.\nAfter returning from holiday, the team elected Chet Bros as the program's first captain. The team trained hard for their first official game against Hamline and, though the match was delayed from the 13th to the 17th, there was an excited crowd on hand to watch. The team took a bit of a hit in mid-January when several prospective players were ruled to be academically ineligible but enough were still available for the Gophers to have some hope for the season. The game was set for the Lexington Park and, despite all of the preseason work, the team got off to a rough start. Despite a lack of practice time, Howard Strange was ruled eligible just before the game and got the start in goal. He performed well in the match, however, as did the rest of the team. Minnesota, unfortunately, was unprepared for how physical Hamline played and were battered up and down the ice. Despite being the visibly more talented team, the Gophers fell to the Methodists 1–2. Minnesota hit the road for their next game and ended up with a much better result, taking down Wisconsin while posting the program's first shutout.\nAfter a second win over the Badgers, Minnesota returned home for a 10-day rest before continuing their season. While the team had initially hoped to play Notre Dame around the end of the month, the match was scrapped and Luther Seminary was inserted in the schedule instead. The Gophers got a surprisingly difficult game from the priests but managed to eke out a 1–0 win. The close shave may have been a bit of a wakeup call for Minnesota as the team suddenly turned into an offensive juggernaut and dominated Wisconsin in the return series. With a clean sweep of Wisconsin, the Gophers sat at the top of the unofficial Big Ten standings and were clamoring for a meeting with the only other active team, albeit on a club level, Michigan. Several attempts to get to two together had already failed and one effort was made to stage a meeting in mid-February but noting ever materialized. In the end Minnesota was able to claim a conference championship but, without a victory of the Wolverines, the title was a bit hollow.\nInstead of Michigan, the Gophers got to face the Engineers from Houghton when they travelled to take on the Michigan College of Mines. After tying the first game, Minnesota was shutout for the first time and lost their best claim for an intercollegiate championship. They still had an outside chance with the return match a few days later but a further loss ended any possibility of being the western champions. As the team entered its final game of the season at the end of the month, they were hamstrung by the loss of Bros. Jacobson was moved back onto the blueline in his stead which caused the top line to be shuffled around. Eldridge was med to win while reserve center Swanson took over at pivot. To fill in on defense, Strange served as a substitute in the match. The ad hoc lineup had a hard time working together but they were still able to avenge their earlier loss to Hamline and prevent the Methodists from claiming the state championship.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | Regular Season"

Ireland earned a third place finish at the Hamburg event, thereby clinching the Rugby Europe Sevens Championship.\nTeams.\nThe current list of teams confirmed to be participating in the \"Sevens Championship Series\".\nPoland, were relegated to the 2023 Trophy tournament after finishing last in the previous year's Championship tournament.\nParticipating teams increased from ten to twelve teams for this year's tournament. This enabled three groups of four teams as opposed to the two groups of five teams that participated in the 2022 Rugby Europe Sevens Championship Series. Both Ireland and England were promoted from the 2022 Rugby Europe Sevens Trophy. However, Great Britain replaced England in the tournament following World Rugby's mandate of Olympic teams competing on the World Rugby Sevens Series from 2023 to 2024 season and the decision by the rugby authorities of England, Scotland, and Wales to merge and compete as Great Britain in advance of the 2024 Olympic games. Romania who finished fourth behind Wales in the 2022 Rugby Europe Sevens Trophy benefited from the three British teams merging by taking up the final position in the tournament.\nSchedule.\nThe official schedule for the 2023 Rugby Europe Sevens Championship Series is:\nStandings.\nNotes:\n As per Rugby Europe rules, Romania was placed higher than Lithuania due to a better head-to-head record and superior points difference for the series.

The team was founded in 2023 and will begin play during the 2024 season.\nHistory.\nOn February 8, 2023, Major League Rugby announced that the Miami Sharks would be joining the league in 2024. Owned by Argentine businessmen Ronaldo “Kony” Strazzolini, Alejandro Macfarlane, and Mercado Libre chairman Marcos Galperin, the team appointed former Toronto Arrows executive Mark Winokur as CEO, Mariano Marco as COO and former Argentina U20 manager José Pellicena as head coach. Pellicena has also previously served as an assistant with the Argentina national team under Mario Ledesma and former Super Rugby side Jaguares under Raúl Pérez.\nOn April 26, 2023 the Sharks announced the signing of Argentine international scrum-half Tomás Cubelli, the first player's signing of the team. The same day, the team held a launch party in Miami with a few Argentine company directors and personalities like tennis player Juan Martín del Potro, model Claudia Albertario and former Argentina international player Juan Martín Hernández who's one of the franchise's ambassadors.\nIn July 2023 the Miami Sharks parted ways with CEO Mark Winokur and hired Mariano Filippini for the position. Filippini previously played as a flanker for Club San Andrés and more recently was an executive for Univision and HSBC Bank Argentina.\nOn September 15, 2023 the Sharks announced that a partnership with Inter Miami CF would allow them to play home games at the AutoNation Sports Field. The stadium capacity would be expanded to include up to 5,000 spectators.\nColors and identity.\nThe Sharks' crest displays a blue and white shark with pink strokes alongside a rugby ball and the term \"Miami Sharks\". The team main colors are neon-styled pink and blue that paid homage to the hit 1980s TV series \"Miami Vice\" which has become a symbol of Miami and identified with the city. \"Miami Vice\" relied on a pastel color pallet, reminiscent of the Miami Heat \"Vice\" special uniforms, that became very popular and inspired the team colours.\nAfter the team's founding, the Sharks quickly unveiled three playing kits. One of the jerseys is mainly white with hints of electric blue and bright pink while the others display pink-to-black and blue-to-pink gradations.\nEstablished by Bonaerenses, the team has a strong Argentine connection and ties with Latin America. Two of the three owners played rugby union in Argentina: Macfarlane for Belgrano Athletic Club like Pellicena, and Galperin for Club San Andrés. The latter stated: “\"We are excited to create a rugby experience in South Florida that will wake the Latin passion in the community and generate a sense of belonging.\"” Choices of coaching staff and executives reflect the club's Argentine identity.\nOwnership.\nThe original ownership pool was led by three Argentine businessmen and company directors: financial services firm Magna Capital president Ronaldo “Kony” Strazzolini, natural gas distribution company Camuzzi Gas main shareholder Alejandro Macfarlane and e-commerce company Mercado Libre funder and CEO Marcos Galperin, the wealthiest man in Argentina with an estimated net worth of $5 billion. Alongside the three founding owners, other investors like Santiago Ocampo, Martín Migoya, Edgardo Defortuna and Gabriel Martino own shares.\nPlayers and personnel.\nCurrent squad.\nThe Miami Sharks squad for the 2024 Major League Rugby season is:\nSponsorships.\nThe Sharks have signed sponsorship deals with investment advisory company BlackToro and Argentine financial services company VALO."

        "text": "Ian Pearce (5 February 1947 – 1 December 1993), also known by the nickname Bunny, was an Australian rugby league footballer and coach. A Queensland representative in the pre-State of Origin interstate rugby league series, Pearce played club football for the Redcliffe Dolphins in the Brisbane Rugby League as a goal-kicking in the 1970s and 1980s. Pearce is remembered as one of the club's greatest players, despite never winning a premiership.\nBackground.\nPearce was born in Blackbutt, Queensland on 5 February 1947. The son of a Benarkin forestry worker, Peace grew up in Blackbutt and played rugby league for the town's club in the South Burnett Rugby League as a goal-kicking centre, with whom he won the 1968, 1973, and 1974 SBRL senior finals. Pearce kicked the game-winning field goal in the 80th minute of the 1968 final to win 6–5 over Kilkivan-Goomeri, and took over captain-coaching duties of the Blackbutt-Kilcoy side for the 1974 competition from Les Clarke.\nPearce also played several games for the Wide Bay Bulls during his time at Blackbutt, including in the 1970 Gold Top Cup State Championship, a predecessor of the Winfield State League featuring most of the Queensland Country teams and a combined Brisbane side, where he scored a try in Wide Bay's 17–9 win over Ipswich. Another notable appearance with the Wide Bay side came during Great Britain's 1974 tour of Australia and New Zealand, where Pearce played in the centres in the Bulls' 12–24 loss to the Lions at Maryborough.\nClub career.\nHaving won his final competition in Blackbutt in 1974, Pearce moved to the Redcliffe Dolphins the following year, where he was appointed captain of the side and would primarily play as a fullback. The Dolphins made the BRL Grand Final in Pearce's first year at the club, a game in which he scored a try and 6 goals, but Redcliffe ultimately lost 24–26 to Western Suburbs.\nPearce captained Redcliffe to the finals again in 1976, but the side were knocked out in an elimination final by Southern Suburbs, who had finished 6th on the ladder but defeated Wynnum-Manly in a playoff to reach the finals. Pearce's three penalty goals were Redcliffe's only points in the game, which had a final score of 14–6 with no tries being scored. Coach Barry Muir left the club after the 1976 season, leading to Pearce being appointed captain-coach for the following year.\nAs captain-coach, Pearce led Redcliffe to a minor premiership and grand final in 1977, winning the Ira Berk Datsun player of the year award, though the Dolphins would lose the grand final 13–17 to Eastern Suburbs.\nPearce retained his captain-coach role in 1978, where Redcliffe won another minor premiership but were knocked out of the preliminary final in a 13–17 loss to Fortitude Valley. The match drew a crowd of 18,000, the largest of the season before the grand final, and was ultimately decided by goal kicks, as each team scored three tries (including one to a young Wally Lewis). Valleys winger Mick Neill kicked four goals, while Pearce only managed two from four at more difficult angles. Despite the disappointing finish to the season, Pearce won the Ira Berk Datsun player of the year award again in 1978, along with the prestigious Rothmans Medal, and finished as the BRL's top points scorer that year, beating the likes of Neill and Mal Meninga. Pearce's 266 points in 1978 is the record for most points scored in a BRL season, and he was the first Redcliffe player to win the Rothmans Medal.\nPearce's time as captain-coach came to an end in 1979, when former Redcliffe player Ron Raper returned to coach the club after leading Western Suburbs to two premierships. Pearce retained the captaincy, but Redcliffe missed the finals for the first time in five years, finishing sixth on the ladder. After missing the finals again in 1980, by just 3 competition points, the club turned to Queensland coach and former Redcliffe great Arthur Beetson, who was named as captain-coach for the 1981 season. This was the only year of Pearce's first-grade career in which he did not captain the Redcliffe side, which finished only one competition point behind minor premiers Southern Suburbs. The Dolphins beat Souths 21–10 in the semi-finals, with Pearce scoring a try and 6 goals, but Souths would knock Wynnum-Manly out of the preliminary final to face Redcliffe again in the grand final. Redcliffe would lose the grand final 13–9, but Pearce was recognized as the runners'-up best player, scoring their only points with a try and 3 goals.\nPearce led Redcliffe for the first two games of the 1982 Woolies Pre-season before being sidelined for 10 weeks with a knee injury, returning in round 1 of the regular season after missing the remainder of the pre-season and the Winfield State League, including Redcliffe's 15–23 final loss to Eastern Suburbs. Pearce was sidelined after Round 3, being replaced as fullback by Trevor Benson and as captain by hooker Bob Jones. He returned on the wing in round 14, scoring a try and 3 goals. Pearce played his final game of rugby league at fullback in Redcliffe's 0-35 semi-final loss to Wynnum-Manly.\nRepresentative career.\nPearce's first representative appearance came while he was still playing for Wide Bay and Blackbutt, when he was selected for the Queensland Country side in the annual City v Country match.\nIn 1973, Pearce was selected as a reserve for the Queensland rugby league team, in the event that Valleys centre Gerry Fitzpatrick was unable to play, though Fitzpatrick passed a late fitness test and Pearce did not take the field. He was first named in the Queensland starting side in 1974, where he played all three games of the series at fullback, kicking 9 goals including Queensland's only points in game 3, a 4–4 draw in which no tries were scored. Pearce would also play for Queensland against Great Britain during their 1974 tour, having already played in the tour for Wide Bay.\nPearce was named as fullback and captain of the Brisbane rugby league team for the 1975 Thiess Toyota Country vs City match, to determine selections for that year's interstate series. After the Brisbane team won 51–2, no country players were selected for Queensland, while Pearce was named captain. Pearce would lead Queensland to a 14–8 win over New South Wales in the first game of the series, the first time Queensland had won an interstate match since 1970 and the last time they would do so before the introduction of the State of Origin selection rules. Pearce also played in the remaining two matches, both losses, kicking a total of 5 goals in the series.\nPearce initially retained his position as Queensland fullback the following year, though he lost the captaincy to Greg Veivers. After participating in the team's warm-up tour of central and north Queensland, Pearce would kick 2 goals in game one of the series before being replaced by Valleys fullback Alan Mills.\nPost playing.\nAfter retiring from playing in 1982, Pearce served as secretary manager of the Redcliffe Leagues Club, before accepting an offer to coach the side in 1985. The 1985 season was not successful for Redcliffe, however, with the side missing the finals for the first time since 1980, and Pearce was replaced as coach by Darryl Van de Velde.\nPearce was killed in a road accident on 1 December 1993, aged 46.\nLegacy.\nIn 1995, Redcliffe awarded the first Ian Bunny Pearce Trophy for their highest points scorer of the season.\nIn 2008, Pearce was named at fullback in the Wide Bay region's team of the century.\nIn 2020, Pearce was named at fullback in the Redcliffe Dolphins' best all-time team.\nIn 2022, Pearce was named the fifth greatest Redcliffe player in a list of the Dolphins' top 75 players for the club's 75th anniversary.\nThe Blackbutt sportsground has been renamed in Pearce's honour."

        "text": "The Romanian Cycling Federation (), abbreviated to FRC, is the national governing body of cycle racing in Romania.\nThe FRC is a member of the UCI and the UEC.\nHistory.\nIn the late 19th century, Romania witnessed a surge in interest in cycling, leading to the emergence of cycling clubs, races, and velodromes. Clubs like \"Velocitas\" and \"Huniade\" were established as early as 1886, followed by the founding of the \"Cycling Association\" in 1889. A notable milestone in Romanian cycling history occurred in 1891 when the first official race in Bucharest covered a 10-kilometer route from Otopeni to Băneasa, with D. Dumitrescu emerging as the winner.\nAs the popularity of cycling grew, the need for organized coordination became evident. The \"Velocipedists Club\" was established in Bucharest in 1891, marking a significant step in the formalization of cycling activities. The year 1893 witnessed cycling races conducted for charitable purposes, further cementing the status of cycling as a recognized sport in Romania. Subsequently, the \"Cyclists Club\" was founded in 1896, followed by the \"Union of Romanian Velocipedists\" in 1897, both aiming to assume the role of a national cycling federation. The turn of the century saw the birth of the \"Union of Excursionist Cyclists\" in 1900, accompanied by the introduction of the country's first monthly cycling magazine, \"Bicicleta\".\nThese developments culminated in the establishment of the Romanian Cycling Federation on April 26, 1931. This marked a pivotal moment in the history of Romanian cycling, formalizing its status as a sport with a national governing body. The federation's foundation was built upon the legacy of the \"Union of Romanian Velocipedists\" (1897) and the \"Cycling Commission\" (1912), both integral in shaping the organized cycling landscape within Romania.\nRaces.\nStarting in 1934, the Romanian Cycling Federation took the helm in organizing the Tour of Romania. This event showcased the nation's top road cyclists as they competed in a multi-stage race across the country.\nThe federation also played a pivotal role in hosting the National Road Championships, providing a platform for domestic riders to vie for national titles in various road cycling disciplines. Additionally, the federation contributed to the staging of editions of the Peace Race. "

        "text": "The 2023–24 Union Garnet Chargers men's ice hockey season was the 83rd season of play for the program, the 32nd at the Division I level and the 32nd in the ECAC Hockey conference. The Garnet Chargers represented Union College, played their home games at Achilles Center and were coached by Josh Hauge in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nPrior to the season, Union College announced that they had changed the moniker for their athletic teams from \"Dutchmen / Dutchwomen\" to \"Garnet Chargers.\" Garnet has been the school's official color for 150 years, and the name \"chargers\" is a reference to \"Schenectady’s legacy as a leader in electrical technologies.\"\nOnce the season began, Union found itself in a fortunate position as eight of its top nine scorers from '23 had returned. That solid foundation helped the team's offense flourish and average nearly a full goal more per game then they had the year before. The attack was led by defenseman John Prokop, who became the first blueliner in program history to lead the team in scoring twice. The bright sport on offense was the power play, which converted on 21.2% of the teams chances. However, while Union ended the season with the #3 offense in ECAC Hockey, they also had the second-worst defense. While the Chargers allowed less than 30 shots against per game, slightly below what they managed to generate, Kyle Chauvette's first year as the starting goaltender was not something to write home about. The sophomore was inconsistent throughout the season, alternating very poor stretches with solid goaltending.\nThe result of being pulled in opposite directions was that Union hovered around the even mark all season. Though the team was able to string wins together, every streak was countered by a lull and by season's end the team sat one game under .500. While the team had no chance for an NCAA tournament berth without a conference title, they at least began their postseason chase with a home stand. In one of their best games of the season, the Garnet Chargers rolled over Brown 6–0 and ended up with two short-handed goals in the game. In the quarterfinals, it was the team's power play that let them down. Union went 1 for 8 in the two games with Caden Villegas providing the only real offense in the series. The two losses ended Union's season and ensure the team a losing record for the fourth straight campaign.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

The Lakers represent Mercyhurst University and are coached by Rick Gotkin, in his 36th season.\nSeason.\nMercyhurst began the season enough, sandwiching a pair of shootout victories between very narrow losses to two Big Ten teams. The Lakers then spent the remainder of the first half of their season playing around the .500 mark, seeing decent scoring totals buoyed by solid if unspectacular defensive play. The result was that the Lakers were sitting with a winning record in conference play and had an outside chance to earn a bye into the conference quarterfinals.\nIn the second half, Mercyhurst started with their best offensive performance to date, scoring 7 goals against Sacred Heart. Unfortunately, the offense dried up afterwards. Mercyhurst went over a month without a win, losing nine consecutive games. The streak sent the team plummeting to the bottom of the standings and also saw their defense surrender many glorious scoring opportunities. Mercyhurst managed to pull themselves out of the dive with a surprising win over ranked RIT but by then the damage had been done. The Lakers finished the year in 9th place and were forced to hit the road for their first round match.\nThe offense again went silent and Canisius scored the first four goals in the game. With nothing left to lose, Rick Gotkin pulled Owen Say for an extra attacked when the team got on a mid-third period power play and the extra attacker enabled the team to finally get on the scoreboard. Several minutes later, The Griffins were assessed a major penalty and gave Mercyhurst the opening the needed. The team was unable to capitalize during the first half of the power play but, after Canisius was given a slashing minor, Mercyhurst managed to add a second goal on the 6-on-3 man-advantage. Still needing two goals to tie, Say was again pulled when play resumed but, after about a minute, Canisius was able to cage an empty-net goal that sealed the game.\nOn November 11, Rick Gotkin became just the 16th coach in NCAA history to win 600 games. He was also the 7th coach to do so with one team.\nDue to a snowstorm, the game against Niagara scheduled on January 13 was postponed to a later date.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

Watkins in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nEager to build on its first winning season in over a decade, Colgate began the year with renewed hope for the program. Unfortunately, the weather was abysmal for the team's ice rink. The Maroons weren't able to get a single on-ice practice in ahead of the first game and even had to have the foundation of the temporary rink rebuilt just days before the first match. The team wasn't able to play until the end of January when they hit the road and took on Penn. Team captain Frank Howe was sick prior to the trip but was well enough to open the scoring against the Quakers. The two then exchanged goals and ended up tied heading to the end of regulation. Just before the final buzzer sounded, Colgate netted its third goal of the evening to win their opening match in a rather improbable manner. The following evening saw a close copy of the opening match when Anderson opened the scoring against Army. This time there were no late-game heroics and the two finished regulation tied at 2-all. Despite firing a barrage of shots at the Cadet cage through 2 overtime periods, Colgate could not break the tie and had to return home with a second win.\nBy the end of the following week, the team's rink was in good enough shape for the Maroons to play their first home game. Unfortunately the team had a poor start against Middlebury and found themselves down 0–3 after the first period. The Maroons redoubled their efforts once the second period began and played the Panthers even for the remainder of the game but they could not overcome the early deficit. A week later the team travelled to face Cornell and the Big Red took revenge for the loss a year before. Colgate was walloped 1–7 and showed a distinct lack of teamwork and preparation in the game.\nA week afterwards, the team was back on the ice but were without their captain. Playing host to St. Stephen's, the Maroons didn't look particularly invested in the game and put up a lackluster performance. It wasn't until the end of the third, when they found themselves down by a goal, that the players showed any fight. Hofheins caged a shot to send the game into overtime but a snowstorm curtailed their attack afterwards. The reprieve allowed St. Stephen's to score the winning goal in overtime, handing Colgate its third consecutive loss. For their final game the team travelled to face Hamilton and could not escape the weather even in an enclosed building. The ice was rough and slow, forcing the teams to play four 12-minute periods so that the surface could be cleaned more often. Neither team could get any offense going in the match and the only goal came with about 5 minutes to play. Unfortunately, the came from a Continental player and Colgate ended a forgettable year with another loss.\nThomas R. Klein served as team manager.\nNote: Colgate's athletic teams did not have a moniker until 'Red Raiders' was adopted in 1932.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

Gone were offensive wizard Joe Cogan and two-way defenseman Dick Stanley, both lost to graduation. In order to fill in those sizable holes, coach Wiggin needed new blood and plenty of practice to get the newly named Bobcats up to snuff. Unfortunately, a new university rule barred freshmen from playing varsity sports during their first semester. This left the team unable to use some of the new students until after the exams in early February. The shorthanded team began their season in early February with a familiar opponent in Bowdoin. Both clubs appeared sluggish in the match and didn't generate many scoring opportunities, however, the Polar Bears were able to defeat Bates for the first time in almost 5 years. The second game saw the Bobcats play much better, however, their opponent was a far tougher match and the team fell to St. Dominique's.\nThe Bobcats got up off the mat when the headed down to Waterville and took on Colby. Corey and Stanley each scored two goals to led the team to their first win of the year and a renewed hope that the Garnet would be able to reclaim their position as the state champions. The next match was played during a blizzard that slowed the New Hampshire game to a crawl. Snow built up across the ice to such an extent that the puck could hardly be moved. It was a minor miracle that any goals were scored and unfortunate that the majority were caged by the visitors.\nBates then embarked on its annual swing south and did not get the results they were looking for. The Bobcats were trounced by Williams in the first match, will Wyllie surrendering 7 goals to Watkins. Though they were more evenly matched the following night, Bates was still routed by Army, this time only giving up 5 markers. A few nights later, the team looked to have finally pulled itself together and battled the Mass Aggies to an even mark at the end of regulation. Two 10-minute overtime periods failed to elicit any more scoring so a third was employed. This allowed the home team to put up two more markers and hand Bates its sixth defeat of the season. The final game before returning home came against Amherst and the team looked in good shape through two periods, however, playing so many game in such a short time eventually caught up to the Bobcats and they allowed 4 goals in the third to finish their trip by losing every match.\nAfter returning home, the team was getting ready for the intrastate games to begin, unfortunately, an early thaw saw all of the ice rinks in Maine become unsuitable for play. The remainder of the season was cancelled for all colleges and left Bates with its worst record in program history.\nDonald Hall served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The ceremony featured songs from different cultures as follows: the Indian \"Saajan ji Ghar Aaye\" and \"Aao re Jhumo re\", Indonesian \"Sing Sing So\" and Japanese \"Sakura\". Various artists from Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China performed \"Triumphant Return\", among them were Alan Tam, Leo Ku and Hacken Lee.\nAfter awarding host badminton player Lin Dan with the most valuable player award, the President of the Olympic Council of Asia Ahmed Al-Fahad Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah officially announced the Games closed. As per tradition, People's Liberation Army personnel lowered the OCA flag, and carried it out of the ceremony venue. Later, the South Korean flag was raised to the South Korean national anthem. The mayor of Incheon, Song Young-gil, received the Games flag as the city was scheduled to host the 2014 Games. The ceremony then proceeded with an eight-minute segment from Incheon called \"Arirang Party\" led by traditional percussionist Choi So-ri in Korean traditional costume along with taekwondo exponents. Famous Korean singer, songwriter, dancer, record producer and actor Rain also performed. Rain sang a medley of three of his hit songs, \"Rainism\", \"Hip Song\" and \"Friends\".\nThe closing ceremony ended with the flame being extinguished and the theme songs \"Everyone\" and \"Cheer for Asia\" being performed."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career double plays as an outfielder leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, a double play (denoted as DP) is the act of making two outs during the same continuous play. One double play is recorded for every defensive player who participates in the play, regardless of how many of the outs in which they were directly involved, and is counted in addition to whatever putouts and assists might also apply. Double plays can occur any time there is at least one baserunner and fewer than two outs. An outfielder (OF) is a person playing in one of the three defensive positions in baseball farthest from the batter, who are identified as the left fielder (LF), the center fielder (CF), and the right fielder (RF). An outfielder's duty is to try to catch long fly balls before they hit the ground or to quickly catch or retrieve and return to the infield any other balls entering the outfield. Outfielders normally play behind the six other members of the defense who play in or near the infield; unlike catchers and most infielders (excepting first basemen), who are virtually exclusively right-handed, outfielders can be either right- or left-handed. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the outfielders are assigned the numbers 7 (left field), 8 (center field), and 9 (right field).\nOutfielders are most commonly credited with a double play when they throw the ball to an infielder who tags a runner attempting to advance on the basepaths, even on a caught fly ball that results in an out (see tag up); of special importance are throws to the catcher if the runner is trying to reach home plate to score a run, perhaps on a sacrifice fly. Outfielders will often record assists by throwing out runners who try to advance farther than the batter, such as going from first to third base on a single, or batter/runners who try to stretch a hit into a longer one. Outfielders also earn double plays on relay throws to infielders after particularly deep fly balls, by throwing to a base to record an out on an appeal play, or in situations where they might deflect a fly ball before another defensive player makes the catch; in extraordinary instances, right fielders have occasionally recorded double plays by throwing out batters at first base after fielding uncaught line drives that reached them quickly. Outfielders record far fewer double plays than other players due to the difficulty of making an accurate throw in time to retire a runner from a great distance; middle infielders routinely record more double plays in a single season than outfielders do in their entire careers. Double plays are an important statistic for outfielders, giving a greater indication of an outfielder's throwing arm than double plays by infielders do. In recent years, some sabermetricians have begun referring to assists by outfielders as baserunner kills.\nTris Speaker is the all-time leader in career double plays as an outfielder with 143. Ty Cobb (104) is the only other outfielder who has recorded 100 career double plays. Jackie Bradley Jr., who had 24 double plays through the 2023 season to place him tied for 247th all-time, is the leader among active players."

The RedHawks represented Miami University, played their home games at the Steve Cady Arena and were coached by Chris Bergeron in his 5th and final season.\nSeason.\nIn the first month of the season, Miami appeared to have resolved whatever problem had been affecting the program over the previous four years. The team went 4–1–1 in October which included a good showing against #13 Arizona State. Logan Neaton was playing well in goal and the many new additions to the lineup were contributing on both sides of the puck. However, as soon as the RedHawks began their conference schedule the results turned sour. Miami followed a strong showing by nearly going winless in November. Neaton's goals against ballooned versus NCHC competition and things got even worse for Miami when freshman Bruno Brūveris got his turn in goal. Compounding the team's problems was the sudden disappearance of their offense as the RedHawks could manage more than 2 goals in just two of eight games during the second month of play.\nThe team's defense recovered a bit in December but by Christmas the RedHawks had yet to win a single conference game. At this point the season was already over with the only hope for Miami being able to win their conference tournament, against teams they had already failed to defeat. Despite their situation, the team fought hard after returning from the break and won their first conference match by downing #10 Western Michigan but it came at a high price. With about 10 minutes to play in the game, Neaton injured himself while making a save and he would miss the next six weeks while recovering.\nMiami now had to rely on Brūveris to carry them down the stretch and the season ended up going from bad to worse. Over an eleven-game span, Brūveris limited the opposition to less than 3 goals just once. With the offense still not providing much support, the team didn't win another match for the rest of the season. Even after Neaton's return in early March, the RedHawks remained in a dismal state and went 0–15–1 to end the year.\nShortly after the end of the season, Miami fired head coach Chris Bergeron. In his five years at the helm, the team had not won 10 games in any season and had finished last in the conference four times.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 1923–24 YMCA College Maroons men's ice hockey season was the 19th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAfter losing an entire season, the ice hockey program attempted a comeback in 1924. The team was organized by the students without the benefit of a head coach but they did receive the blessing of the school for an official team. Unfortunately, the college decided against building a temporary rink on Pratt Field and the team was forced to find other accommodations.\nThe initial game of the year was supposed to be played against Rensselaer, however, warm weather forced that game to be postponed. Instead, the team travelled to take on Williams for the opening match. The ice was in very poor condition with slush and water littering its surface. passing and stickhandling were nigh impossible which actually helped the Maroons as the team had hardly been able to train on an ice surface prior to the contest. The team slogged over the soft ice and managed to fend off the Ephs for the entire match. In the second, a long-distance shot from Witherall found its way into the net and was the only score of the game. The succeeding match with Cornell was cancelled and the team instead took on the local amateur hockey club. The Maroons were by far the better of the two and got goals from all three forwards in the game.\nWith the surprising start to the season, it appeared that YMCA might be able to produce a fine campaign. The team next had the makeup game with RPI and were expected to win since the Engineers were still one of the worst programs in college hockey. Unfortunately, the team found a blizzard waiting for them in Troy and found it very difficult to play in the adverse conditions. Hamm was able to score in the middle frame but that wasn' enough to overcome Rensselaer. The following week the team travelled to take on Amherst and got into another close battle with the Sabrinas. When the dust settles the team was one goal short and the loss dropped them back to an even record. While the team didn't know it at the time, the next game would mark a turning point of the season. A week later the team was back in Amherst, this time to take on the Mass Aggies. On poor ice, the teams started out with a scoreless first period. The second saw the Aggies' captain hit in the eye by a stick and sent to the hospital. The irate Agates took over the game and crushed the Maroons in the second half of the match, scoring 4 goals in the second and then adding another 3 in the third.\nStill reeling from their third consecutive loss, the team headed up to New Hampshire to take on one of the top teams in the nation and Dartmouth showed no sympathy to the Maroons. The Indians hammered YMCA 0–15, inflicting the worst defeat for the program in nineteen years. Without any usable ice, the team could not fix any of its problems afterwards. 10 days later, the team was embarrassed again, this time to the tune of 1–12 by Hamilton. The final game on the schedule, March 1 at Army, was cancelled due to bad weather.\nThe collapse of the team at the end, coupled with the lack of a rink for the program, convinced the school to suspend the program once more and it would be nearly three years before the team played its next game.\nM. M. Swartz served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "Bowling F.C.",
        "text": "Bowling F.C. was an association football club from the village of Bowling, West Dunbartonshire, active in the 19th century.\nHistory.\nThe first record for the club is its playing in the Dumbartonshire Junior Cup in 1886–87. Its first appearance of note was entering the Dumbartonshire Cup in 1887–88, but Bowling scratched when paired with Dumbarton Athletic in the first round.\nThe club took the bold step of joining the Scottish Football Association in August 1888, despite Dumbartonshire being the home of some of the strongest teams in the world at the time. The futility of such a step was demonstrated by its appearance in the 1888–89 Scottish Cup, losing 8–0 to Renton, which had recently demonstrated a claim to be the very strongest.\nThe two clubs were drawn together again the following season, this time Bowling at home, but still conceding 8. Bowling did at least score a consolation goal. Two months later, Bowling played for the first time in the Dumbartonshire, at Union, and getting off to the best possible start, by scoring within a minute; even with 20 minutes to go, the score was still 1–1, but Union scored three late unanswered goals. The club put in arguably its best performance in a friendly at the start of the season, drawing 2–2 with Dumbarton, albeit a scratch Dumbarton side.\nThe Scottish FA introduced qualifying rounds from the 1891–92 season onwards, and Bowling withdrew from the association. It continued to enter the county cup until 1892–93, its best attempt at avoiding defeat coming in a farcical tie against Kirkintilloch Athletic. The first attempt at the match had to be played as a 70-minute friendly as the referee had not turned up at Kirkintilloch, ending with 1 goal to Bowling, and 1 disputed goal to the home side. The second was postponed, and the third won by Kirkintilloch, but Bowling successfully protested that the match finished in darkness due to Athletic not turning up in time. The fourth did not take place, as Bowling did not turn up, and Athletic was awarded the tie, amid local muttering that \"the Bowling seem able to play best at the association meetings in Dumbarton\".\nThe final recorded match for the club was a 7–2 defeat at Dumbarton Rangers in February 1893.\nColours.\nThe club wore black and white hoops with white knickers.\nGround.\nThe club played at Dunglass Park, a field behind Dunglass Castle provided by Captain Buchanan, notable for its \"neat pavilion and beautiful pitch\"."

The team was coached by James Ballantine in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nAs the season began, Colgate had the benefit of not needing to replace any last year's players as all lettermen were still at school. Several newcomers did try out for the team but, with no void to fill, the Maroons could afford to be deliberate in their selection process. Three rinks were planned for the school; two on Taylor Lake and a third east of the willow path. A small slate of 6 or 7 games was arranged for the team with only one game per week until the very end of the season.\nDespite getting some decent ice time ahead of their opening match with Army, Colgate was slow out of the gate and allowed the Cadets to build a 3-goal lead after just one period. The Maroon defense stiffened afterwards but the offense could never get anything going. Team captain Gormley made several spectacular saves to prevent the score from getting out of hand but the forwards were unable to give him any assistance. The team performed better in the second game against Cornell and Sanford got his team on the board first with a goal just a few minutes into the match. The Big Red steadily scored three goals to take a 2-goal lead but Sanford responded with his second to put his team within one. Unfortunately, the Cornell netminder was not accommodating and Colgate was unable to complete the comeback.\nAfter being delayed until early February, the team travelled up to Buffalo to take on the Nichols Hockey Club, an amateur outfit. On the best ice they had seen all year, the team was able produce their best offensive output with 4 goals. However, the defense was not ready for the speed of the game and surrendered 10 goals to the home team. Due to the cancellation of other matches, the final game of the year was at Hamilton and the Maroons had the misfortune of playing one of the top teams in college hockey. Colgate was seemingly on the defensive for the entire game and could hardly resist the overpowering attack from the Continentals. Sanford scored the only goal for the Maroons but that did nothing to overcome the 8 markers that fond their way behind Gormley.\nThough the team lost all of their games, worse news was to come when the school decided against continuing the program. The Maroons would not play another official game for over 5 years.\nWarner Chadwick served as team manager.\nNote: Colgate's athletic teams did not have a moniker until 'Red Raiders' was adopted in 1932.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 2023–24 Alaska Nanooks men's ice hockey season was the 74th season of play for the program and 39th at the Division I level. The Nanooks represented the University of Alaska Fairbanks and were coached by Erik Largen in his 5th season.\nSeason.\nAfter narrowly missing out on the NCAA tournament in 2023, Alaska entered the year hoping for another chance at postseason play. The primary goal for the club would be to replace the stellar effort of the now-graduated Matt Radomsky in goal. That task fell first to transfer Pierce Charleson but he had a tough time at the start. The Nanooks opened the year by dropping a match to Denver that saw all three goaltenders in goal. Charleson and nominal backup Lassi Lehti allowed 4 and 3 goals respectively while Will Hambley stopped all the shots he faced (albeit in only 4 minutes). Hambley got the start in the second game and allowed the Pioneers to make a fool of him as well. After the poor start, Pierce Charleson settled into the starting role with a winning road trip over the next two weeks against a pair of ranked opponents. Alaska's offense appeared to be a strength early in the year but a sweep at the hands of Northern Michigan around Thanksgiving demonstrated that the team still had some work to do.\nDespite some hiccups, Alaska possessed a winning record by Christmas and had a chance to move up into an at-large berth if it performed well in the second half of the season. The Nanooks kicked off their return with an appearance at the Great Lakes Invitational. An overtime loss in the semifinal stopped the team from getting anywhere in the PairWise rankings but that could easily be rectified the following week when they faced #4 North Dakota. Anything positive could have raised the teams tournament hopes a great deal, however, the Nanooks ended up getting swept in the series. The losses did not end the team's postseason hopes immediately, however, they gave Alaska no room for error in the remainder of their schedule.\nThe Nanooks still had four games against Arizona State, a ranked team, but the rest of their slate was filled with average-to-bad teams that would not provide much help even if the Nanooks were to sweep every match. For Alaska to make the postseason, they would likely have to run the table or at least come close. Unfortunately, their old rival Alaska Anchorage had other ideas. Still smarting over losing the previous 10 games, the Seawolves redoubled their efforts and forced Alaska into a tie and then followed that up with their first win against the Nanooks in over 4 years. The loss started a 4-game slump in Alaska's offense and by the time the Nanooks pulled out of the dive, their postseason hopes had been shattered. With nothing to lose, Lehti was given the starting job at the end of the season and performed well over a 4-week stretch. The wins helped to lift the team's record above .500 for the season and gave a possible glimpse at the Nanooks' future starting goalie.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

The Seawolves represented the University of Alaska Anchorage, played their home games at the Avis Alaska Sports Complex and were coached by Matt Shasby in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nReturning with largely the same lineup as the year before, Alaska Anchorage got off to a decent start and were able to play even hockey over the first month of the season. The Seawolves ended with a win over a ranked Penn State squad as well as a vast improvement in play from all quarters. In their first three losses, the team fell by just a single goal which helped lift the team into the middle of the national rankings. Unfortunately, UAA was unable to sustain that level of play and the team suffer through a raft of poor goaltending and uninspired offense. During that stretch the team won just 2 out of 12 games but, thanks to a 41-save performance from Jared Whale, the Seawolves managed to take down one of the best teams in the country, Wisconsin.\nWhen Anchorage began the second half its season after Christmas, the team had no real chance of making the postseason, however, they still had something to play for. The Seawolves began with a tie against Alaska, ending a 12-game losing streak to their long-time rival. The following week the team travelled to Rhode Island and earned a split with #9 Providence. The surprising victory kicked off a long stretch of winning hockey that saw the team play far better on both sides of the puck. The Seawolves finished out the year with a split against Arizona State, earning their fourth win over a ranked opponent on the season. Anchorage ended the year just shy of a .500 record but team had improved by leaps and bounds.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 2023–24 Bowling Green Falcons men's ice hockey season was the 55th season of play for the program and the 45th in the CCHA. The Falcons represented Bowling Green State University, played their home games at the Slater Family Ice Arena and were coached by Ty Eigner in his 5th season.\nSeason.\nJust before the start of the season the team's leading scorer from last season, Austen Swankler, abruptly left school and entered the transfer portal. Shortly afterwards, head coach Ty Eigner was placed on leave and three players were suspended due hazing allegations. A little over a month later, an independent investigation discovered that older players had provided alcohol for underaged persons at an off-campus event. At the time there was no evidence that Eigner or any of his staff were aware of the behavior so the coach was reinstated. However, due to the nature of the violation, the school's athletic director, Derek van der Merwe, began to directly oversee the program while requiring the coaching staff to receive additional training to prevent a recurrence. This incident was particularly galling for Bowling Green as the school was still recovering from the 2021 death of Stone Foltz that led to hazing becoming a felony under Ohio state law.\nThe season progressed under a cloud and saw the get off to a very poor start. With the offense missing six of its top seven scorers from a year ago, the team desperately needed to be coached into a cohesive unit, something Eigner could not do while suspended. As a result, the Falcons didn't show much ability to score until November. The defense, too, suffered early and returning starter Christian Stoever was soon replaced by Cole Moore in goal. As a freshman, it took Moore took some time to get up to speed. He started to look like he had sorted himself out right about the same time that the offense began to come out of its hibernation. Beginning in mid-November, Bowling Green started acting like a functional team and was able to earn a split or better for four consecutive weeks. The steady play from the Falcons had them in the middle of the CCHA standings by Christmas.\nThe Falcons opened the second half of their season with a pair of defeats to Ohio State. The losses gave BG a terrible non-conference record and left the Falcons only one path to the NCAA tournament: a conference championship. The team took that to heart and once they resumed conference play, Bowling Green rolled over their competition. Over a month-long stretch, the Falcons went 6–1–1 and put themselves within shouting distance of a 1st-place finish. The offense looked better than it had all season and didn't even stop when their leading scorer, Ryan O'Hara, was injured on February 3.\nJust when it appeared that the team was heading for a home stand in the postseason and a better than average chance at a championship, the offense vanished. Bowling Green scored just 2 goals in its final four games. The four losses dropped the Falcons to 6th in the standings and forced them to hit the road for the quarterfinals. The opening match with Michigan Tech saw more of the same with the team getting shutout for the third time in as many weeks. The offense did show some signs of life in the third period and was able to continue that trend into the rematch. With their season on the line, the Falcons opened strong with two goals in the first 8 minutes. A lapse at the start of the second allowed Tech to take the lead but BG was able to regain the lead in the middle of the period. With their narrow lead, Bowling Green could ill-afford any mistakes but that's exactly what happened. The Falcons tool a pair of penalties in rapid succession to give the Huskies a lengthy 2-man advantage. Michigan Tech scored twice more before the third to retake the lead. BG tied the game once more at the start of the final frame but then continued to commit infractions. The Falcons were whistled for two minors in the third and while they were able to kill of the first, Tech netted its fourth power play goal of the game on the latter and swept the Falcons out of the postseason.\nShortly after the conclusion of the season, Eigner was fired.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The Equestrian Show Academy () is an equestrian academy located in Versailles, in the Grande Écurie.\nHistory.\nIn 2002, the Palace of Versailles returned these premises to their original function, choosing Bartabas to revive the Grande Écurie. Created in 2003 by Bartabas in the Grande Écurie of the Palace of Versailles, the Equestrian Show Academy is an innovation in the field of performing arts and is intended as a higher education establishment. Its mission is to pass on the knowledge and skills involved in writing equestrian shows, by combining various artistic disciplines. The originality of this equestrian art academy lies in the fact that it combines \"Haute École\" dressage work with other disciplines such as fencing, dancing, singing and traditional Kyudo (Japanese archery).\nIn the Grande Écurie at the Palace of Versailles, the Academy presents a number of shows, including \"La Voie de l'Écuyer\", choreographed by Bartabas and a reflection of this school/company, as well as \"Les coulisses de l'Académie and Les Visites du patrimoine\". The Académie is also at the service of original creations, for example, the Grand Palais in Paris, the Saint-Ouen Abbey in Rouen, and the Ancient Theater of Fourvière. Every weekend, the riders present their repertoire in \"La Voie de l'Écuyer's\" show. This show includes the Lusitano carousel, sorraïas with long reins, fencing on horseback and equestrian improvisations to chords by Johann Sebastian Bach.\nThe king's Grande Écurie.\nThe historic site was built by Jules Hardouin-Mansart in the late 17th century to house the royal cavalry. In collaboration with the Palace and Monuments Historique's departments, Bartabas commissioned Patrick Bouchain to restore the Grande Écurie. The riding arena was designed as a theatrical set, with a nod to the Hall of Mirrors, Murano glass chandeliers and mirrors in which horses and riders are reflected. The light, mobile architecture was inspired by Parma's Farnese Theatre. Opposite the tiered seating, decorated with baskets, the golden sand track occupies two-thirds of the surface. The stables have been designed to take into account the harmony of volumes, the constraints of the Academy's operations and Bartabas' requirements for the well-being of the horses. New stalls have replaced the old ones. The vertical lights are twisted, in contemporary reference to unicorns.\nCollaboration with the École d'Art Mural de Versailles.\nA backstage area was built at the rear of the theater, surrounded by panels painted by the École d'Art Mural de Versailles. Created by Catherine Feff, with the École d'Art Mural de Versailles, K del Corral, H. Faivre, M. Retif and the 2012-2013 graduating class.\nThe Versailles Equestrian Academy.\nCreated in 2003 by Bartabas within the Grande Écurie, the Equestrian Show Academy of Versailles is a \"corps de ballet\" unique in the world. Founded as much on the art of transmission as on the art of performance, daily teaching here combines Haute École dressage with various disciplines such as fencing, dance, singing and Kyudo (Japanese archery). In this way, the equestrians develop a genuine sensitivity that is put at the service of a very singular repertoire, dedicated to the public, thus perpetuating the transmission of a light-hearted equitation in the French tradition. The Academy is also dedicated to original creations, choreographed by Bartabas, in France and abroad.\nIn its fifteen years of existence, this company-school of excellence has become a benchmark, performing at Versailles in the purpose-built riding arena, as well as on French and international stages, with its own repertory shows, Bartabas creations and collaborations with great artists such as Carolyn Carlson and Marc Minkowski."

        "text": "The 2023–24 Minnesota State Mavericks men's ice hockey season was the 55th season of play for the program, 28th at the Division I level, and 3rd in the CCHA. The Mavericks represented Minnesota State University, Mankato in the 2023–24 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season, played their home games at Mayo Clinic Health System Event Center and were coached by Luke Strand in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nDue in no small part to the departure of former head coach Mike Hastings to Wisconsin, Minnesota State saw a mass exodus of players in the offseason. The Mavericks ended up losing the top nine scorers from the previous season, leaving Luke Strand a herculean task ahead of him. To make matters worse, last year's staring goaltender, Keenan Rancier, had to have offseason surgery on his hip and would be unavailable for the star of the season. The team did receive a small bit of good news with Sam Morton having fully recovered from a season-ending knee injury.\nEven with circumstances going against them, the Mavericks began the season well, sweeping preseason #10 St. Cloud State at home. Unfortunately, Alex Tracy played inconsistently for the rest of October and the team went winless to finish out the month. Things got a little better once the team settled down but one thing became abundant as the season progressed; while the offense appeared to be operating well, led by Morton, the defense was lacking. Minnesota State had been one of the best teams in recent years in terms of shots against per game. Last season the Mavericks had allowed less then 19 attempts on goal per match but now, with all of the changes that the Mavericks had undergone, MSU was surrendering almost 50% more opportunities per game. While the performances of the two netminders was about the same, the increased shot volume resulted in about half a goal against per game more. The first half of the year saw the team swing between good and bad stretches in even amounts to end up at exactly .500 by the winter break.\nAfter the time off, Minnesota State returned looking like a new team. Tracy and Rancier played about as well as they had all season and helped the team run through January with a 5–1–2 record. By the beginning of February, Minnesota State looked primed to capture its 7th consecutive conference title but that's when the team ran out of gas. Over the final five weeks of the season, The goaltending returned to its early-season form and allowed at least three goals in six of eight games. The offense was unable to compensate and Minnesota State lost five games, all in regulation. On the final weekend of the regular season, MSU still had a chance to finish atop the standings but they were shutout in consecutive games by Bemidji State and fell to 4th.\nTracy was given the starting role in the postseason and fulfilled the assignment by stopping 58 of 60 shots from Northern Michigan. The stout goaltending was more than enough to lead the team to a sweep and a trip to the semifinals. Higher-seeded Michigan Tech awaited the Mavericks in the second round but it looked to be MSU that was the better team. Minnesota State held the lead after the first and second periods but both times Tech was able to tie the match. Adam Eisele gave the Mavs their third lead of the game at the 6-minute mark of the third period and brought upon a furious attack from the Huskies to tie the score. Tracy was unable to stop a penalty shot from tying the game with under 5 minutes to play but neither team was able to get the equalizer and the match seemed destined for overtime. In the waning seconds of the game, Minnesota State won a defensive faceoff but Steven Bellini was unable to clear the puck. A rushed shot from the blueline was stopped by Tracy's pad but deflected up and off the glass. The puck rebounded up and over the net and Jordan Power attempted to knock it out of harm's way with his glove. The Maverick defenseman missed the puck which instead hit him in the helmet and hopped back towards the goal. back towards the goal. Tracy saw the puck at the last moment and appeared to try and head the puck away but it bounced off of his mask and dropped into the goal with just 9 seconds left in the game. Minnesota State was unable to produce a miracle to tie the game and saw their season end on one of the more crazy endings imaginable.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

It was created in 2021 to act as Premiership Women's Rugby, then Premier 15s, equivalent to the men's Premiership Rugby Cup. It typically takes place in the international windows, giving more opportunities to inexperienced players.\nFormat.\nThe Allianz Cup uses a format where Premiership Women's Rugby clubs are divided into two pools based on their previous season's finishing positions. Over five rounds, each team played every other team once, with a combination of two home games, two away games, and one bye week.\nThe top two teams from each pool progressed to the semi-finals, which were hosted at the venues of the highest-ranked clubs. These semi-finals are accompanied by a third-place play-off and a grand final. The grand final took place at the home venue of the club with the most significant points difference.\nThe bottom four ranked teams participated in fifth, seventh, and ninth-place play-offs. The venues for these play-offs were determined by the league tables.\nFor the 2023–24 competition, with the withdrawal of Worcester Warriors Women reducing the participating teams to nine, the nine teams were divided into a pool of four and a pool of five. The top two teams from each pool advanced to the semi-finals, the semi-finals are accompanied by a third-place play-off and a grand final, while the third-place team from each pool progressed to a two-legged 5th-6th place play-off, with the winner determined by aggregate score. The fourth-placed team from the pool of four and the fourth and fifth-placed teams from the pool of five advanced to a 7th-9th place play-off, utilizing a round-robin format to determine the finishing order of the three teams."

        "text": "The 2023 Major League Cricket final was a day/night 20-over cricket match played on July 30, 2023, at Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas between the Seattle Orcas and the MI New York to determine the winner of the inaugural season of Major League Cricket. The MI New York won the match and the title by defeating the Seattle Orcas by 6 wickets. MI New York player, Nicholas Pooran, was named man of the match for his 55-ball 137*.\nBackground.\nOn June 13, 2023, the schedule for the 2023 season of Major League Cricket was released. 2 venues, Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina were scheduled to host the games. The play-off schedule was announced on the same day, with Grand Prairie due to host all play-off matches. The final was played between Seattle and New York on July 30, with the latter winning the title by 7 wickets.\nRoad to the final.\nGroup stage.\nIn the start to their inaugural campaign, the Orcas' went top of the table by recording a 5-wicket win over the Washington Freedom, a 35-run win over the San Francisco Unicorns, and an 8-wicket win over the Texas Super Kings. The Orcas' winning streak was snapped, however, during a 2-wicket defeat to the Los Angeles Knight Riders. A 2-wicket win over MI New York assured the Orcas' a first-place finish going into the finals nevertheless.\nIn contrast, New York began their campaign with a 22-run defeat to San Francisco. This was followed by a 105-run win over Los Angeles in their second game, a 17-run loss to Texas in their third, and a 8-wicket win over Washington in their fourth. In their final group stage game, they lost to table-toppers Seattle by 2 wickets. Despite the loss, they nevertheless still qualified for the play-offs.\nPlayoffs.\nThe playoffs were played in a similar fashion to the Indian Premier League, with Seattle defeating Texas by 9 wickets in the Qualifier and New York recording back-to-back victories against Washington and Texas in the Eliminator and Challenger matches, respectively, to go to the finals.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nFollowing New York's decision to field first, Quinton de Kock played a brilliant knock of 87 runs off 56 deliveries, with Shubham Ranjane's 29 off 16 and Dwaine Pretorius's cameo of 21 runs off 7 taking Seattle to 183 runs for the loss of 9 wickets. With the ball for New York, Rashid Khan and Trent Boult both picked up 3 wickets a piece, with Steven Taylor and David Wiese taking a wicket each. In the chase, Imad Wasim and Wayne Parnell got some early breakthroughs for Seattle but couldn't stop Nicholas Pooran's stunning knock of 137* off 55 deliveries taking New York to a maiden MLC title.\nSeattle Orcas innings.\nSeattle got off to a slow start, with New York's Trent Boult and spinners keeping Quinton de Kock and Nauman Anwar in check. Anwar eventually fell in the fourth over to Rashid Khan, trying to loft a back-of-a-length delivery over leg. de Kock and Shehan Jayasuriya steadied the innings, accumulating 41 runs for the second wicket, before Jayasuriya was out caught and bowled by Steven Taylor. Hienrich Klaasen, too, fell for 4 off Rashid's bowling in the twelfth over. Thunderbolts' player Shubham Ranjane then came in a played a cameo of 29 as de Kock fell for 87 to Trent Boult. Imad Wasim and Andrew Tye fell for relatively low scores in the death before Pretorius's cameo of 21 in the final over powered Seattle to 183 for 9.\nMI New York innings.\nIn response to Seattle's 183 for 9, New York's Steven Taylor was bowled by Wasim early into the innings, trying to loft a shot for a maximum. Even as Nicholas Pooran was unleashing a blistering assault at the other end, Shayan Jahangir failed to pick up the pace and was eventually caught by Tye off Parnell for 10. Dewald Brevis then came into the mix, with him rotating the strike back to Pooran, who was single-handedly winning the game for New York. Seattle's bowlers were unable to find a response against Pooran, before they finally found a breakthrough after Brevis was run out for 20. With the score 137/3 after 12.2, Pooran and Tim David steered the chase and won the game for New York by 7 wickets.\nScorecard.\nFall of wickets: 25/1 (Nauman Anwar, 4.1 ov.), 66/2 (Shehan Jayasuriya, 9.1 ov.), 91/3 (Heinrich Klaasen, 12.1 ov.), 142/4 (Quinton de Kock†, 16.1 ov.), 157/5 (Imad Wasim, 17.6 ov.), 157/6 (Shubham Ranjane, 18.1 ov.), 163/7 (Andrew Tye, 18.5 ov.), 181/8 (Dwaine Pretorius, 19.5 ov.), 183/9 (Wayne Parnell, 19.6 ov.)\nFall of wickets: 0/1 (Steven Taylor, 0.3 ov.), 62/2 (Shayan Jahangir, 4.6 ov.), 137/3 (Dewald Brevis, 12.2 ov.)"

        "title": "List of Women's Cricket World Cup records",
        "text": "&lt;section begin=\"World Cup Summary\"/&gt;\nThe first ever Cricket World Cup was organised for women in 1973 by the English Women's Cricket Association, based on an idea by cricketer Rachel Heyhoe Flint and businessman Jack Hayward. After the success of the Women's Cricket World Cup, the men's tournament took place two years later.\nSeven teams competed in the inaugural tournament in England which took place over five and a half weeks. Each ODI match was 60 overs and every team played each other in a round-robin league format. Subsequent tournaments were hampered by lack of funds for women's teams meaning that their scheduling for many years was inconsistent. The 1997 World Cup was the first to be played with 50 overs and a knock-out stage.\nSince the inaugural tournament, there have been a total of 12 World Cups with the 13th planned for 2025 in India.&lt;section end=\"World Cup Summary\"/&gt; Australia have won the most World Cups, having won 7 out of the 12 tournaments. Several important records have been set at the Women's World cup, including the first 400+ score in ODI cricket and the first ODI double century, both of which predate the records in men's ODIs. \nNotation.\nTeam notation\nBatting notation\nBowling notation\nRecent records\nTeam records.\nResult records.\nLowest win margin (by runs).\nAs well as these narrow victories, there have been three matches where the scores finished level, two in the 1982 World Cup and one in the 1997 World Cup.\nMost extras.\nAn extra is a run scored by a means other than a batter hitting the ball. Other than runs scored off the bat from a no-ball, a batter is not given credit for extras and the extras are tallied separately on the scorecard and count only towards the team's score.\nOther records.\nGrounds.\nThe World Cup has been held in India, England and New Zealand three times each. As many of New Zealand's grounds have multiple fields, they dominate the list. However, even when those fields are considered as separate grounds, they still take places 3 in the top 5. \nUmpires.\nMost matches (female umpire).\nAdditionally, Shaun George has umpired in three World Cup finals (2005, 2013 and 2017), more than any other umpire.\nAppearances.\nRepresenting more than one team.\nThe inclusion of Young England, the International XI, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago in the early years of the tournament meant that players who would otherwise have been eligible to represent their national teams played for others in the World Cup. However, only a handful also appeared for those teams at another World Cup. \nThe only player to represent two national teams is Nicola Payne who played for the Netherlands for 10 years and for 4 for New Zealand, which meant she appeared at 4 World Cups in total. \nAge.\nA total of 94 players aged 19 years old or under have made an appearance in the World Cup and 10 players aged more than 40 have played in the competition."

        "text": "The 1927–28 Massachusetts Agricultural Aggies men's ice hockey season was the 20th season of play for the program. The Aggies were coached by Lorin Ball in his 4th season.\nSeason.\nAs the season began, MAC was again having to deal with warm weather. As the team waited for ice to form, the candidates practiced in Drill Hall and tried to get ready for the first game. team captain Joe Forest was back along with Abrahamson and Frese, all of whom had two years of varsity play under their belts. Cook and Nash had both seen action the previous year and were expected to jump up into starting roles. The big question was who would take over in goal. Rudquist, last year's backup was available but so was Patch, a transfer from Dartmouth. The rink conditions didn't allow the team to get any on-ice training until early January but the team coalesced around their veterans.\nThe Alumni Field Rink was in good enough shape for the first match and saw MAC outplay Bates for much of the game. Unfortunately, the team was stymied time and again by the Garnet goaltender and were unable to find the twine. The story was much the same the following week when MAC travelled to meet Army. Poor ice prevented any real teamwork and the Aggie players were outclassed by the Cadets. After allowing a pair of quick goals in the third, Phinney was subbed in for Devine but that didn't spark any offensive pushback. Rounding out the road trip, the team made a stop in Clinton to take on Hamilton. On the first good ice of the season, the team looked more composed and played a solid defensive game. Phinney looked good in his first start while Forest got the Aggies on the board for the first time all season. However, their efforts were not enough to save MAC and the team lost once more.\nThe following week saw the team play two games on back-to-back nights. To add to the difficulty score, the first matches were road games and forced the team to take an overnight train for the second before playing on short rest. The first of the two contests was against New Hampshire. The Wildcats were a much bigger team than MAC, averaging about 30 pounds heavier, and used their size to their advantage. UNH pushed the Aggies around on rough ice and built a comfortable lead by the start of the third. After the home team inserted subs into the lineup, captain Forest swiftly caged a pair of goals in about 1 minute to get the team within striking distance. The quick outburst forced the Wildcat starters back into the game and they nursed what remained of their lead to the end of the game. The second contest was played on a much better surface and MAC battled Bates hard in a rematch. The two were mostly even through the first two periods, however, the Aggies began to tire in the third and were eventually outpaced by the Bobcats.\nAfter a few days rest, the team played host to Amherst on a very cold day. With the ice in about as good of shape as it had been all season, the game was fast. Unfortunately, from the start it was apparent that the Lord Jeffs were the better of the two and the Sabrinas gave few opportunities to the Aggies. Amherst scored in each period and had total control of the game thanks to their oppressive defense. Patch got MAC on the board with just 20 seconds left in the game to prevent a shutout but that didn't stop the team from dropping its sixth consecutive game. There were still a few games left on the schedule, however, the weather turned afterwards and made it impossible to play any of those matches. In terms of winning percentage, this was the worst season in the history of the program despite the fact that the team had not played particularly poorly during the year.\nJames Cunningham served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The series will be open to Hypercars (built under Le Mans Hypercar (LMH) or Le Mans Daytona h (LMDh) regulations) and for the first time LMGT3 racing cars.\nThis is the first season of the World Endurance Championship without the LMP2 class, after it was dropped due to the increasing demand in the Hypercar and LMGT3 classes. The LMP2 class will still take part at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The LMGT3 class was introduced to replace the GTE class that was dropped at the end of the 2023 season. A maximum amount of 37 cars was set for the full-season grid. \nManufacturers entering in the LMGT3 category will only be allowed to enter a maximum of two cars, to allow for a greater diversity in the LMGT3 category. Priority is given to manufacturers who have also entered a car in the Hypercar category.\nCalendar.\nOn 9 June 2023, during the 2023 Le Mans weekend, the calendar for the 2024 season was announced. It contains eight races, including two completely new races and two returning races. The 1000 Miles of Sebring, 6 Hours of Portimão, and 6 Hours of Monza races will not return in 2024, with Monza not being held due to the track being redeveloped. The Imola event would later replace Monza as the Italian round on the schedule, while the series will make its first visit to Qatar to start the season, allowing hotter weather than Sebring. The 6 Hours of São Paulo, which was last visited by the WEC in 2014 alongside the Lone Star Le Mans round that was previously hosted in 2020 would also make their return to the calendar.\nThe prologue was originally scheduled to happen on 24 and 25 February but was delayed due to shipping issues.\nEntries.\nThe number of entries was capped at 37 cars due to garage limitations at Imola and the Circuit of the Americas. Frédéric Lequien, CEO of Le Mans Endurance Management, outlined a goal to increase the grid size in future seasons.\nHypercar.\nNotes\nResults and standings.\nRace results.\nThe highest finishing competitor entered in the World Endurance Championship is listed below.

        "text": "The 1921–22 Bates men's ice hockey season was the 3rd season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nUnder new head coach, \"Razor\" Watkins, the Bates hockey team convened in early December and put together an ambitious schedule that had them playing as many as 16 games. Probably the biggest change for the club was the final decision to transition away from the rover position, as most colleges had already dispensed with the extra player in recent years. Bates had played 7-man hockey for all but one game over the previous two years but, as most of their opponents had bent to the 6-man trend, Bates had to follow suit. The team spent a month getting into shape and welcomed their old foe Bowdoin after returning from the winter break. The first half was played with a rover and the second without. However, the biggest factor in the match was the poor condition of the ice. The pace was slow and stopped either team from getting much in the way of offensive chances. After a scoreless first, Roberts netted the games only goal midway through the second and led Bates to their first win of the season.\nThe second game a week later saw Bates dominate the local St. Dominique team. A hat-trick from Cogan in the second period allowed coach Watkins to use alternates in all 6 positions for the third period and cruise to a 4–0 win. A day later, the team was in Berlin to take on a very strong amateur squad. The team was outmatched by their opponents and were outshot 10 to 40 in the game but gave the crowd of 700 a decent showing nonetheless. After a few cancellations and postponements, Army was up next for the club as the team went on its longest road trip to date. Batten was nearly as busy as he had been against Berlin and stopped 32 shots but, due a lack of offense, the team lost the match 1–4 with Cogan scoring their only goal. That trend continued as the team made a layover in Amherst, losing a pair of games with only one goal to show for their efforts. The garnet looked better in the final match against Yale, holing a lead going into the third period, but ultimately fell 3–5.\nDespite playing well in many of their games, the team's record was in a horrible state by the beginning of February due to poor offensive output. The team had some time off before their next match and made the most of it. By the time they hosted the Portland Country Club, the offense was in fine form. While the team was without captain Rounds, McKenna and Dagnino played a strong game on defense with Partridge taking over in the goal. Though the game was only 30 minutes in length, Bates pumped 4 goals into the opposing cage, producing their best offensive performance to date. A few days later the team took the hammer to a local aggregation and allowed just 3 shots on goal to the Lewiston Independents. The game was so lopsided that Hinds got some playing time in goal despite the game being just 20 minutes in length.\nThe rematch with St. Dominique's was even better than the original with Roberts, Stanley and Dagnino each netting a pair of goals while Cogan, the team's leading scorer, posted 4 for himself. The next night the team was in Augusta, vying for supremacy with Colby. Due to the small size of the rink, the game was rough and a bit ragged but the Garnet got three goals from Stanley to lead them to Victory. With the earlier win over Bowdoin, Bates claimed the state intercollegiate championship and appeared to have fully recovered from their early-season scoring woes. A week later Colby came to Lewiston for a rematch and they were easily dispatched 7–0. Cogan recorded another hat-trick in the match but the victory was a total team effort. The club finished out the year with one more victory over St. Dominique to post the program's first winning season.\nOn several occasions, a rematch with Bowdoin was arranged only for winter storms to force its cancellation. Despite the best efforts of both schools, a rematch never took place.\nW. Gurney Jenkins served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "1924–25 Yale Bulldogs men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1924–25 Yale Bulldogs men's ice hockey season was the 30th season of play for the program. The Bulldogs represented Yale University and were coached by Clarence Wanamaker in his 4th season.\nSeason.\nBefore the season even began, hopes of the team repeating their championship performance were dealt a blow when the New Haven Arena burned down. Without their home of several years, the Bulldog leadership got together and arranged a plan to help the team remain together. Thankfully, rival club Princeton was willing to help and allowed Yale the use of their home venue, the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink, twice a week for practices until the Christmas break. Initially, the plan was to then move practices to Bishop's Pond in nearby Woodbridge, Connecticut but the weather would have the ultimate say on that idea. In any event, due to a lack of a home rink, the team would spend most of the season on the road.\nWhen the team gathered for its first on-ice meeting in early December, they were already dealing with injuries. Two players, Cottle and Scott, had been injured during the football season and were unable to participate. In spite of the problems, the Bulldogs took the defense of their title seriously and dealt with the setbacks as best they could. By the time the winter break rolled around, the team had coalesced into a solid unit and were gearing up for a busy holiday. Before kicking off their extended road trip, the team's first game came against Kent School and they got a surprisingly tough fight from the prep schoolers. Regulation ended 0–0 and necessitated overtime, fortunately the Bulldog's depth allowed them to score three times in the extra 5 minutes and capture their first win of the year. While the game was a near disaster, it did give the team their first glimpse of future Bulldog star, Ding Palmer.\nOn Boxing Day, the team gathered in New York City to take a night train northwest to Lake Placid. The Bulldogs were put through their paces by Williams in three games but came out as the victor each time. Though the Ephs seemed to stronger with each contest, Yale was able to use their superior numbers and teamwork to hold off the purple attack. After a day of rest, the team then headed out to Pittsburgh for a pair of matches against Queen's. Despite the perceived superiority of their northern counterparts, Yale was again victorious in their games. While the Canadians grew more physical as the series progressed, Yale kept to their game and finished their road trip with an unblemished mark.\nBy this time, the starting line of Scott, Turnbull and Ferguson was a well-oiled machine but it was the team's defense that carried them to victory. Potts and Sargent were a nearly impenetrable duo on the blue line and whatever got past them was usually halted by team captain Alston Jenkins. The team routinely used several alternates to keep its starters fresh but also allowed the replacements to get significant playing time and get up to speed as well. The crammed session of games appeared to put the team in good standing because they were able to shutout the Tigers in their first conference game of the year. The Bulldogs took a bit of a breather in their next match which was also their first pseudo-home game of the year. The temperature had dropped low enough for the Woodbridge plan to work and the Elis enjoyed a relaxing evening at the expense of the UMass Aggies. The team won handily and didn't even miss Ferguson, who was out with an injury. Lawrence Noble replaced him at the start of the match but the score was so lopsided that Yale was able to use all of its alternates after jumping out to a 7–0 lead by the end of the first period.\nWhile the team was undefeated to that point in the season, arch-rival Harvard was next up and were expected to give the Elis their biggest test of the season. Despite being played in Boston, the game was marred by poor ice and slowed down the pace of play. The sad state of the rink affected both teams but didn't stop Yale from getting two separate 1-goal leads. Unfortunately, Harvard was able to answer both times and the Elis had to rely on stellar play from Jenkins to stay in the match. Eventually the game was sent into overtime and Harvard got a glorious opportunity about half-way in. Crimson winger Austin broke in on the Bulldog cage while Jenkins charged out to meet him. A quick shot was partially stopped by the Yale netminder but the puck squirted between his pads and slid towards the goal. While the on-ice referee ruled that the puck had not completely crossed the line before being cleared away, the goal judge overruled the ref and credited Harvard with what turned out to be the game-winner. The Elis were forced to stew over the loss for a couple of weeks as the exam break had arrived and they did not play again until February. Unfortunately, by this time the weather had warmed and Bishop's pond had turned into a slushy quagmire. The ice was so bad that both teams agreed to only play two periods and neither was able to score. Jenkins was credited with a tremendous performance despite the conditions. Less than a week later, the two met for a rematch in Hanover and Yale's stingy defense enabled the Elis to take the game with a few quick passing plays.\nAs the season was beginning to wind down, Yale had to abandon any hope of playing at home and the remainder of their games were all on the road. After a very close win over Boston University, the Bulldogs got their rematch with Harvard. Yale had to win the game in order to have any hope for a league title. However, just before the game, Alston Jenkins was taken ill and had to replaced in goal by Ives. This disaster led many to believe Harvard would win the game, not least of which because the Crimson had also dropped BU by a score of 6–1. Defying expectations, the entire team rallied behind Ives and acting-captain Henry Scott and put forth possibly their best performance of the season. Scott opened the scoring in the first while the defense held Harvard back. The two teams exchanged goals in the second, leaving Yale with the lead at the beginning of the final frame. Sargent scored his second marker early in the third and precipitated a desperate attempt by Harvard to tie the score. The Crimson managed to get one with about 3 minutes remaining but Yale held on to win 3–2 and force a rubber match later in the year.\nIves continued his inspired play by shutting out MIT in the next game but was replaced as soon as Jenkins was well again. The switch saw no drop in play as the team's captain blanked Princeton for the second tine that year, setting the team up for the deciding match with Harvard. Entering the game, both Harvard and Yale were undefeated against all other collegiate opponents. This meant that the winner of the game would be declared as the eastern champions. Throughout the match, both teams demonstrated staunch defensive play with both forward units being unable to get anything into the nets. The match was typified by reliable back-checking from the Harvard skaters and stellar defensive play from Jenkins. As the game wore on the ice grew rough and several otherwise glorious opportunities were squandered. The result was a 0–0 score after 60 minutes and the two prepared for overtime. Rough play in the first extra period led Scott to be removed due to a knee injury and Cotter took his place for the remainder of the match. The physicality continued until Harvard's Chase was given a penalty for checking Turnbull into the boards but the Elis were unable to capitalize on their advantage. After the second 5-minute overtime, the two headed into a sudden-death period that would, presumably, last until one team scored. Luckily for the Elis, Harrison Turnbull gathered the puck in his own end and skated nearly the length of the ice, weaving through the entire Harvard team, before firing a clean shot to win the game and the Championship for Yale.\nJ. H. P. Gould served as team manager with W. H. West Jr. as his assistant.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#00356B\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"

The tournament was originally scheduled to start on June 6, 2023, however, it was moved to June 27, 2023, due to the Philippines women's national volleyball team competing at the 2023 Asian Women's Volleyball Challenge Cup.\nThis conference introduced three debuting teams in the league — Farm Fresh Foxies and Quezon City Gerflor Defenders as newly formed teams, and the return of Foton Tornadoes in the Filipino volleyball scene after the original team was rebranded as Chery Tiggo Crossovers in 2020. Philippine Army Lady Troopers is skipping this conference due to military training to most of its players.

        "title": "Riverhead Rugby League Club",
        "text": "The Riverhead Rugby League Club was a rugby league club which existed briefly in 1916 and competed in the Auckland Rugby League 3rd grade competition. They were based in Riverhead in West Auckland, New Zealand.\nHistory.\n1915 Exhibition games.\nIn 1915 the Auckland Rugby League decided to play a 3rd grade special exhibition match in Riverhead on July 24 between the Newton Rangers 3rd grade side and a local Riverhead team. The match was refereed by Mr. Shaw but there was no result reported in the newspapers the following Monday. Then the following week the Sunnyside club were granted permission to travel to Riverhead to play also.\n1916 Club formed.\nOn May 5, 1916, the Auckland Rugby League held their weekly management meeting and it was reported that “a newly formed club at Riverhead wrote expressing a desire to participate in the third grade competition, and the secretary was instructed to communicate with its officials with regard to the steps necessary for affiliation”.\nTheir first ever game was scheduled to be played at Riverhead. It is unknown where exactly the ground was located. The present day Riverhead War Memorial Park was formed in 1932. The match was played on May 20 against City Rovers. The referee was former New Zealand international Stan Weston. There was no score for the match reported. During the following week the league officially approved of the Riverhead clubs colours as green. At the same meeting that organised that the club would play in the city on alternate Saturday's and that when they played at Riverhead opposing captains would be responsible for making their own launch arrangements to make their way up the Waitematā Harbour to Riverhead. In their second match they had to travel to the city to play at Victoria Park, Auckland. Their opponents were Sunnyside. The Observer newspaper wrote that “the Riverhead club journey to town on Saturday, and play at Victoria Park. The members of this newly formed club are showing great keenness, as evidenced by their desire to travel in order to play a game”. On May 31 the transfer of William Doran to Riverhead was approved. They played Richmond A on June 10 but once more no result was reported. A week later on June 17 they suffered a heavy 44–0 defeat to Newton Rangers. On June 21 the former Newton and Māngere Rangers player, H. Hira was regraded to third grade and registered with Riverhead. At the same management committee meeting Hugh Scally was nominated by the club to represent them on the Junior Advisory Board.\nOn the following Saturday on June 24 they hosted Thames Old Boys and lost 14–0. They had a bye on June 24 before a match with Richmond B on July 8. They then defaulted their match with City on July 15. However the league decided to reschedule the match for a later date after the club notified the league that they had been unable to travel due to “launch troubles”.\nThey played Sunnyside on July 22 before then defaulting two consecutive matches against Thames and then City. The league had a rule whereby two consecutive defaulted matches meant that a team had forfeited the right to compete and so they were ultimately the last ever fixtures for the club. After their removal from competition the club sent a donation of 1 pound and 5 shillings which they had raised from a dance to the rugby league. The money was to go to the Red Cross.\nThe club wrote a letter to the league which was received at the August 16 board meeting. It stated that “owing to enlistments, it was unable to raise a team for the remainder of the season, and asked permission to withdraw from the competition”. The request was agreed to be the league and three members of their team were granted transfers to the City Rovers second grade team. The players were William Doran, W. Mouse, and Ernest Ruby. Ernest Ruby enlisted in the war in 1917 and his name is on the Riverhead War Memorial Park gates. After returning from the war he played for the City Rovers seniors in the early 1920s and then for Devonport United before debuting for the Auckland representative team in 1927. He played 9 games for them from 1927 to 1931.\nIn April, 1922 the Auckland Rugby League received a letter \"that a league club had been formed at Riverhead, and asking whether teams could come up to play them\". The league looked to see if junior teams could travel there on their bye day to play.\nTeam record.\nThey had 10 fixtures scheduled. Only 2 games had scores reported while they defaulted 3 other matches. The results from their other 5 games are unknown."

        "text": "Daniel John Hughes (19 September 1869 – 11 February 1951) was a Taranaki and New Zealand rugby union player. He is number 51 on the list of New Zealand national rugby union players.\nBiography.\nBorn in Patea, Hughes was educated at Manaia School, Taranaki. Playing in the hooker position, Hughes represented the Waimate (Manaia) and later Tukapa rugby clubs as well as the Taranaki Rugby Football Union at provincial level.\nAt the age of 24, Hughes played one match for the New Zealand national rugby union team, against New South Wales at Lancaster Park in Christchurch on 15 September 1894. New South Wales had lost seven out of its eight games prior to the international including 6–21 in its game against Taranaki, in which Hughes played. However, New Zealand unexpectedly lost to New South Wales by 6 points to 8. Alfred Bayly who was the New Zealand captain scored a try before leaving the field injured with concussion, which seriously affected the home side. After the New South Wales loss, New Zealand did not play another match until against a touring Queensland team in 1896.\nHughes was regarded as having a powerful physique and was an accomplished wrestler.\nIn later life Hughes stood for the New Zealand Parliament as a New Zealand Liberal Party candidate in the Taranaki electorate. He was runner up in the 1914 New Zealand general election to Henry Okey of the Reform Party (New Zealand). Hughes was also a director of the Kaupokonui Dairy Company and a member of the Waimate Council."

        "title": "1929–30 Massachusetts Agricultural Aggies men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1929–30 Massachusetts Agricultural Aggies men's ice hockey season was the 22nd season of play for the program. The Aggies were coached by Lorin Ball in his 6th season.\nSeason.\nAfter its first good season in many years, MAC was able to put together a schedule with tougher opponents who, coincidentally, had more consistent access to usable ice. To help the team continue its winning ways, all but one of last season's lettermen were returning (minus Robby Nash), though only about fifteen men showed up for tryouts at the beginning of December. With a more experienced team than usual, coach Ball could take his time settling the roster and ended up tabbing Gunness to take over Nash's spot on the blueline. Another new entry to the squad was Herb Forest, younger brother of former team captain Joe Forest.\nThe first game of the season was set to take place on January 7, however, due to poor ice conditions the match was postponed for a couple of days. When the weather did not improve, the team faced the prospect of a second postponement. Instead of putting the match off a second time, the Aggies were able to secure the Eastern States Coliseum and play on a pristine sheet of ice. Though there was little teamwork in the first two periods, MAC was able to take a 1-goal lead from Forest's first of the year. The team looked much more composed in the third and began to play as a unit. The Aggies kept the puck in the Connecticut end and scored four more goals to walk away with a win. The team then headed out to face off against Hamilton. In the previous six meeting between the two, the Continentals had won every match but the Aggies had been getting closer and closer to the Blue and Buff in recent years. Early on, it appeared as if the streak would continue when Hamilton took a 2-goal lead just seven minutes into the game. However, The Aggies' defense stiffened afterwards and stopped several attempts at increasing the Continental's score. Frost halved the lead a few minutes later and Gunness tied the match just seconds before the buzzer. MAC attacked the Hamilton cage in the third but the Blue netminder played and outstanding period and didn't let anything get behind him. The constant assault did eventually wear down the Hamilton defense and Davis gave the Aggies their first lead early in the third. A solid defensive effort from Bond and Gunness for the remainder of the game allowed just 6 shots on Myrick in the final period, all of which he stopped.\nThe first extend road trip began with the team traveling to face Army but, due to the weather, the game had to be played at Bear Mountain. Playing in fog that obscured either end of the rink, the MAC defense was unable to stop the attack from Lindquist as the Cadet captain scored 4 goals seemingly by himself. The Aggies had a hard time finding their skating legs and didn't score until the final 22 minutes of the game. Though three Aggie goals were scored, it wasn't enough to complete the comeback and MAC was handed its first loss of the season. Weather remained a problem and a succeeding match with St. Stephen's was cancelled, leaving the team to travel down to Rhode Island and face Brown. Unfortunately, the team played a terrible first period and found itself down 0–4. The Bears coasted in the final two periods and scored three more goals while the Bruno netminder stymied MAC by stopping every shot that came his way. After the embarrassing end to the trip, MAC returned home and had good enough weather to play its first home game of the year. After allowing a goal early, the Aggies redoubled their efforts on the defensive end and put the clamps on the Bates offense. Art Brown, plying in his first game of the year, tied the score just before the end of the first. Frost gave the team the lead in the second and the defense then fended off a desperate band of Bobcats in the third to eke out a victory.\nWith the team back in the win column, the Aggies headed out on a northern swing and made their first stop in New Hampshire. For a change, MAC took a lead against the Wildcats when Manty scored after stealing the puck. UNH tie the match before the first period was over but neither team could manage score afterwards. A 10-minute overtime was arranges and MAC continued to pour on the offense. It took 5 minutes for Davis to give the lead back to the Aggies, who outshout their opponents 38–18 in the match, and the defense was able to carry the club the rest of the way. Frost was injured in the overtime by a hard blow to the leg but he managed to play in the rematch with Bates the following evening. The Bobcats gave MAC a fight and fired more than 30 shots on goal. Though three got past Myrick, he was credited with keeping his team in the game against a withering attack. The offense was well represented with goals from four different forwards, the final coming from Waechter about halfway through the third.\nAlmost as soon as the team got back home they were back on the road and the Aggies were off to Boston. The team met Northeastern for a goaltending battle that saw no scoring in the first two periods. A 15-foot shot eluded Myrick and found its way into the net in the third, which turned out to be the only goal of the match. After losing a practice game to a team composed of former college players, led by former captain Jack Hutchinson, MAC renewed their series with cross-town rival Amherst. Forced onto the local pond due to warm weather, MAC attacked the Purple net all evening and never once gave the Sabrinas a chance to score. Herb Forest converted two brilliant passed from Dicky Bond into goals in the first and that was all the offense the team needed. While the Amherst netminder played an outstanding game, the total lack of scoring from the Lord Jeffs doomed the visitors and assured the Aggies a second consecutive winning season. The game was notable for the absence of Gunness, who was replaced on the blueline by Brown.\nThe next game on the schedule was supposed to be a road trip to Storrs, Connecticut, however, due to no ice on account of the weather, the rematch with the Connecticut Aggies was played on the campus pond in Amherst. The nutmegers were a vastly improved team over the outfit that MAC had faced in the first match of the season. The opposing netminder stopped many good chances from the Maroons in the first two periods, though Frost was able to get one goal at the start of the second. CAC tied the game early in the third, however, just two minutes later, Manty scored the final goal of the game to take season series for the second year in a row. Gunness returned to the lineup, however, with how well Brown had played in on defense, he took over as the starting blueliner while Gunness served as a reserve winger. The final game came a few days later when the team travelled to Williamstown. Though they fought valiantly, it was readily apparent that the Ephs were the better team than the Aggies. Williams held the balance of play in the middle period, scoring three goals to take a commanding lead. Forest and Bond combined to attempt a comeback but it wasn't to be and MAC ended an otherwise successful season with a loss.\nVincent Riley served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The calendar confirmed the already arranged 2023 Tonga tour of England, and also announced a 2025 Lions and Lionesses tour of Australia (which will include the revival of The Ashes), 2027 Kiwi tour of England, 2028 Kangaroo tour of England, and a 2029 tour between England and an unconfirmed Pacific Nation. The announcement also stated a 2024 Samoa tour of England would be likely, as this was already being discussed by the two nations, however Samoa eventually declined the offer. The calendar also announced that the Women's Rugby League World Cup would be a stand alone event starting in 2028. In addition, there would be a renewed focus on regional tournaments to aid in developing lesser rugby league nations. A later announcement confirmed the Wheelchair Rugby League World Cup would also be a stand alone event starting in 2029."

        "title": "1923–24 Massachusetts Agricultural Aggies men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1923–24 Massachusetts Agricultural Aggies men's ice hockey season was the 16th season of play for the program. The Aggies were coached by Doc Gordon in his first season.\nSeason.\nAfter just one season as a coach, Herbert Collins left in the offseason to take over as director of athletics for Natick High School. In his place the school turned to another former Aggie and Howard \"Doc\" Gordon agreed to take over control of the ice hockey team. He got got news early in the year as 30 men showed up for the first practice in December, the largest group of candidates the program had yet seen. Several veteran players were returning, led by team captain Eliot Goldsmith, and would be augmented by several good prospects from the freshman team. The biggest concern, however, was in goal and the team knew that would have to resolve their netminding position if they had a chance of competing. MAC had set up a very difficult schedule with several games against strong programs.\nHeading into the first game at Dartmouth, the Aggies had very little practice time owing to a lack of ice. The team had tried to get over to use the Boston Arena during the winter break, however, the rink was in high demand from many other colleges and organizations and MAC could only get in one full practice session. Once ice did form on Alumni Field, coach Gordon tried to cram as much training as he could into a short span of time. After a temperature spike caused the game to be postponed until a later date, the Aggies returned home and played host to Amherst. Due to the weather, the game was played on a campus pond rather than the rink and the rough ice slowed the game to a crawl. Several stoppages were needed to retrieve the puck when it was sent over the low boards that further deadened the game. Neither goaltender was busy during the match as both teams had trouble getting to the offense. The first goal was scored by Amherst through a deflection off of one of the MAC players and followed by about 20 minutes of even but scoreless play. In the third, Kane, the Aggie goaltender, stumbled to the ice but managed to make the save. The referee, Granger, was slow in getting to the net and awarded the goal to the Sabrinas. Neither team appeared happy with the decision but both had to accept the ruling. It was somewhat fortunate that the second goal didn't decide the game as it prevented a controversial outcome, but it still left the Aggies with a loss to open the year.\nWeather caused two further games to be cancelled and the team scrambled to find a place that had usable ice. Eventually they managed to secure a match with the Albany Country Club. While the golfers were former college players themselves, the soft ice gave the game a similar character to the Amherst match and provided the Aggies with an unexpected advantage. Goldsmith and Crosby put up a stirling performance on the blueline while Kane came into his own with several stellar saves. The defensive work allowed the forwards the time needed to find their game. Lamb and Nicoll scored in the third period of the abbreviated game to give the Aggies the win. The team then took a night train and had little sleep before their next game the following day with Hamilton. The Continentals got off to a quick start, scoring twice in the first period. They added two more markers in the second to just one for MAC, leaving the visitors looking up at a 3-goal disadvantage. The team played about as well as could be expected and scored twice in the final period but each goal was matched but one from Hamilton and the Aggies were unable to wear down their opponents.\nDuring the winter break the team headed down to Connecticut to take on Yale and the differences between the two teams could not have been more stark. After a scoreless first period, Yale's offense broke through in the second, scoring 4 goals. The Elis swept MAC off of the ice in the third with a further 6 markers. The blame for the colossal defeat was laid on the size of Bulldog team as Yale could rely on many more substitutes than MAC to keep their players fresh throughout the match. The following week the team played host to YMCA College and thing began to look up for the Aggies in the second. During a scrum in front of the Maroon cage, however, Goldsmith was knocked to the ice and was bleeding profusely from his eye. The captain had been cut by a stick and was taken to Cooley Dickinson Hospital in nearby Northampton. Sam Gordon took Goldsmith's place in the lineup for the remainder of the match. The team redoubled its efforts and scored four goals in the middle from while adding another three in the third.\nWith Goldsmith still receiving treatment and out for the rest of the year, Gordon started the next game at Army and the team played its fastest game of the year. The MAC forwards bombarded the Cadet cage with shots all game long but could not pull away from the home team. The teams exchanged leads in the first two periods and entered the third ties at 2-all. Army got its second lead with about 10 minutes to play and sent the Aggies scrambling for a reply. MAC desperately tried to win the match for their fallen captain and launched about 20 shots at the Army net in the final five minutes but nothing got past the Cadet goalkeeper. The next game saw the Aggies finally get their match with Dartmouth and suffered their second embarrassing loss of the year. While the margin was same as seen against Yale, the Indians were obviously the better of the two from the jump and even the presence of Goldsmith wouldn not have changed the outcome. The Greens were up by 2 goals before 90 seconds had elapsed and then toyed with the Aggies for the remainder of the match.\nMAC began the final week of the season with a home stand against Williams. The two teams were the equal of the other for the first two periods and entered the final frame with one goal apiece. John Stephenson took over the game in the third, scoring 4 goals in quick succession and putting the match out of reach for the Aggies. The team ended the year with a short jaunt to the Lord Jeffs' rink for a rematch with Amherst. While the game started slow, the Aggies picked up the pace as the match wore on. MAC played as a team throughout the evening and ensured that Lamb's solo marker was all that was needed for a victory.\nLeon Regan served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "1920–21 YMCA College Maroons men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1920–21 YMCA College Maroons men's ice hockey season was the 17th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nThe hockey team met for the first time in early December and began to prepare for an 11-game season. Due to a fairly warm winter, the temporary rink was rarely usable for practice and the team was forced to train on the local lake instead.\nIn spite of the difficulties, including a postponement of a match with Williams, the Maroons were ready to go for their first game at Rensselaer. YMCA netted two goals within the first 8 minutes of the game and RPI responded by pulling back and trying to defend. While this curtailed the scoring for the Maroons, it also meant that their goal was not under threat. The Engineers didn't realize their mistake until YMCA made it 3–0 at the start of the second half but by then it was too late. Benny Leonard had missed the team's train when it travelled to Troy but managed to catch a later one. He changed into his equipment en route and ran to the rink from the station, arriving in time to play the final 5 minutes of the game. The team continued its good start with a win over Amherst a week later. In a very physical game, the Sabrinas opened the scoring less than 5 minutes into the game but were unable to increase their lead. The hitting and rough play increased in the second half and broken sticks littered the ice surface. Fink's goal forced overtime, enabling Delano to put the winning goal while Begg held the fort.\nThe Maroons headed off to take on Army in their next game. While playing on soft ice, the two teams were evenly matched throughout the contest and were never more than a goal apart. After a scoreless opening half, Fink gave YMCA the lead early in the second. The teams then traded goals until the score was tied at 2-all and YMCA headed into its second overtime game of the year. The extra session saw both teams score once and, due to the fading light, Army decided against a second overtime session so the match was declared a draw. The team returned home for the next game and found the ice equally as soft but, fortunately, still playable. a 2-goal surge from Noren in the second half led the team to victory over an underpowered Tufts club.\nWeather had caused the cancellation of several game already but all further matches in Massachusetts were wiped out due to a lack of ice. Luckily, the Maroons were able to take a trip north into Maine and play three games in as many days. They started their road trip by playing the Portland Country Club and played well against a team of former college players. As opposed to their earlier games, this match was divided into three 15-minute periods. For the first two, YMCA matched the home club goal for goal but they could not sustain the effort in the third. If the team's first night game of the year, YMCA surrendered 4 goals in the third to make the game appear more lopsided than it actually was. The following night they faced Bates at the local winter carnival and fought another close, physical game. Starr was singled out for being particularly rough in the match and was removed from the game, however, the defense was able to withstand his loss and limit the Garnet to just one goal. Noren and Fink provided just enough offense for the team to eke out a win and remain unbeaten against collegiate opponents. The third and final game of the trip was played at Bowdoin and the team was beginning to tire. Two hard games sapped some of the team's strength and they appeared sluggish in the first half. Starr and Courtney played a solid defensive game but the Whites were still able to get one past Begg to take an early lead. The Maroons were rejuvenated during the break and overpowered the Polar Bears in the second half. In less than 8 minutes, YMCA scored 4 goals, including a hat-trick from Noren, and swept Bowdoin off of their home surface.\nThis was by far the best season the program had yet produced. Going undefeated in 6 games against college opponents put the Maroons into the upper echelon of the small schools and left them with a legitimate claim for the junior intercollegiate championship.\nJ. Howard Starr served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The game is depicted from an over-the-shoulder viewpoint. When creating a character, points can be spent to improve different shot types (backhand, smash, etc.), or decrease points in a shot type to spent them on another shot. In the season mode, the player starts seeded 100 and earns money playing tournaments around the world that can be spent on improving shot types. Before each match, two special abilities can be selected like diving or tweener.\nReception.\n\"Amiga Action\" called the game \"average\" and said \"Pro Tennis Tour 2\" is a better game. \"Amiga Power\" liked the graphics but didn't like the \"muddy controls\". They called the game frustrating and \"a tad dull\". \"Aktueller Software Markt\" called the game fast and extremely playable tennis sim. The ST version was said to be not as fast as the PC version. \"ST Format\" and \"CU Amiga\" said the game is better than \"Pro Tennis Tour\" or \"International 3D Tennis\". \"Amiga Mania\" called the game \"thoroughly enjoyable\"."

        "title": "American Football House",
        "text": "The American Football House is a house in Urbana, Illinois, United States, famed for its appearance on the cover of Midwest emo band American Football's 1999 self-titled debut album. The house's interior was also featured on the cover of the band's 2016 self-titled second album. The house has since become \"one of music's biggest landmarks\", attracting tourism, especially in the emo community.\nHistory.\nBuilt in 1893, the American Football House is located at 704 West High Street in Urbana, Illinois, near the campus of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. One of the house's earliest residents was Charles M. Webber, who died while living in the house in 1931. Two of Webber's great-great-grandchildren, Adam and Michael Thies, worked at Polyvinyl Records, the Champaign-based record label behind American Football.\nBy the 1990s, the house had become a popular venue for college parties and punk concerts. While a student at the university in the late 1990s, photographer and album cover artist Chris Strong lived in the basement of the house with his then-girlfriend. No members of American Football ever lived in the house, but as fellow students at the university, they were friends with Strong and frequently attended parties at the house. When American Football enlisted Strong to design cover artwork for their 1999 self-titled debut album, Strong took \"a couple thousand\" photographs of the house. The photograph used for 1999's \"American Football\" was a nighttime shot of the house's exterior, tilted upward at the second-floor window. When asked why the band chose this particular image, lead vocalist Mike Kinsella said, \"we just liked the photo.\"\nAfter American Football's 2000 breakup and 2014 reunion, Strong shot a 2014 music video inside the house for \"Never Meant\", the opening track on the band's 1999 album. An interior shot of the house's stairwell, also taken by Strong, was featured on the cover of the band's 2016 self-titled reunion album. In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, American Football performed a virtual concert to over 10,000 viewers, set at a replica of the house built in \"Minecraft\".\nOwnership.\nIn fall 2022, the American Football House was put up for sale, with rumors indicating that housing developers planned to demolish the house and build a condominium in its place. On May 5, 2023, American Football announced on social media that they had purchased the house collectively with Polyvinyl Records, Chris Strong, photographer Atiba Jefferson, and the Chicago-based Open House Contemporary.\nIn a statement on the purchase, Polyvinyl wrote: \"Besides being a literal home to its many tenants throughout the years, The American Football House has come to represent a nostalgic dream of possibility and the beauty of the beginning. We could not let that dream go.\" The house still had tenants at the time of the purchase, but Polyvinyl co-owner Matt Lunsford said there are plans for its future.\nArchitecture.\nThe American Football House is a two-story house with white wood siding and a prominent window on the front-facing gable. Chris Strong described it as \"not a terribly well-constructed house\". Former resident Jessie Knoles recalled, \"The hallway to the kitchen was so small and there was a door to a pantry in the tiny hallway so when the pantry was open, people from the living room couldn't make it to the kitchen.\"\nLegacy.\nAs American Football accrued a cult following in the years after their 2000 breakup, the house became the main image that fans associated with the music. In a 2014 interview, Mike Kinsella argued that the main reason why the house has endured as a symbol is that \"it's pretty much one of the only images affiliated with the band.\" The house's iconic status has been compared to the Andy Warhol banana print on the cover of \"The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico\".\nIn a 2016 article, \"Vice\" named the American Football House \"one of music's biggest landmarks\", describing it as one of the most famous tourist attractions in the emo community. As of 2023, the house is designated as a \"place of worship\" on Google Maps. Some fans have etched an \"X\" into the sidewalk to mark the exact location where Strong stood to take the iconic photograph from the 1999 album."

In the 250 class, Jett Lawrence went into the season as the defending champion, after winning his second 250 title the previous season. However, Lawrence moved up to the 450MX class, which meant he did not defend his title.\nIn his rookie season in the 450 class, Jett Lawrence recorded a perfect season by winning all 22 races.

Though a traditional power, the Tigers had slipped after the war and were vulnerable to the upstart Rams. Fordham also had a distinct home ice advantage in that the 181st Street Ice Palace was not only much smaller than Princeton was used to (causing the game to be played with 6-men teams) but it had pillars set in the ice that had to be avoided during the match while also being played on rough ice. This enabled the Rams to neutralize the speed of the Tigers and win the game with two goals in the second. The Rams used the same advantages against Penn, however, since the Quakers were an inferior team, the score was much more lopsided.\nA week later, Fordham continued its torrid pace by taking down the Mass Aggies 8–3. With the Rams primed for a shot at an intercollegiate title, three pending games would determine the teams fate. Unfortunately, it appears none were forthcoming. While Fordham records end in January, no other programs report games against the Rams for the remainder of the season.\nEdward Curley served as team manager.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "Edward Collins Lewis (August 13, 1910 – January 29, 2006) was an athlete from Portland, Oregon who played basketball collegiately for Oregon State College from 1929–30 to 1932–33. A lanky center with good ballhandling, passing, and shooting skills, Lewis captained the team during his senior campaign and led the Pacific Coast Conference in scoring.\nLewis was named to the 1933 All-Pacific Coast Conference Team and the 1933 All-American Team. He was selected a member of the Oregon State Sports Hall of Fame in 1980. He was named to the Pacific-10 Conference's Hall of Honor in 2005.\nLewis' jersey number 25 is one of only five retired from use by Oregon State University.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nEdward Collins Lewis, universally known by the nickname of \"Ed,\" was born August 13, 1910, in Seattle, Washington. He was raised by a single mother, Faye Beagle Lewis, spending his earliest years in San Francisco before moving with her to Portland, Oregon.\nHigh school career.\nLewis played center for Washington High School in Portland, where he garnered all-state honors as a Junior following the 1927–28 season. The team would win the Oregon State basketball championship in 1928.\nLewis' Senior campaign was interrupted, however, as he was sidelined by an injury early in the year which kept him out of action until the opening of the Oregon state high school basketball tournament in March 1929. Lewis immediately made his impact felt, chalking up 19 points in the opener for the Colonials in a 32 to 25 win over Wallowa High School.\nWashington High's run came to an abrupt halt in the semi-final round, however, when the Astoria High School Fishermen scored a dramatic 26–24 upset victory in a defensive battle played in Salem.\nLewis finished the tournament with 64 points scored, leading all other scorers by a wide margin. After the season he was made a near-unanimous choice for All-State honors at the center position.\nOregon State College.\nIn the fall of 1929 Lewis entered Oregon State College (OSC) in Corvallis where he would play for young head coach Amory \"Slats\" Gill. With Freshmen prevented by rule from participating in varsity sports, Lewis cut his teeth with the Freshman team during the 1929–30 basketball season, establishing himself as the team's emotional and scoring leader. This year would be marred for OSC when second year coach Slats Gill fell ill immediately before conference games began, forcing assistant coach Dick Newman to take the helm at short notice.\n1930–31 season.\nLewis' participation with the OSC varsity began in the 1930–31 season, which opened with two double-digit wins over the Multnomah Athletic Club, prompting the Portland team's coach to declare, \"That's the greatest Beaver team I've ever seen.\" The OSC team returned talented Senior shooters Rod Ballard and Buck Grayson, but it was the addition of the 6'6\" Sophomore center Ed Lewis that took the unit to the next level.\nA preseason trip through California incurred only two losses and the Beavers started the Northern Division season hot, winning three out of four against Washington State and Idaho, but Lewis suffered a knee injury in a game against the University of Washington in Corvallis, forcing him to miss six of the last nine games and limiting his time to short minutes in the other three.\nOregon State faded without Lewis, with the rival University of Oregon rising up to beat the Beavers twice in a row, knocking them out of second place in the division. Washington would go on to win its fourth straight Northern Division crown, then knocking off the Cal Bears to win its first Pacific Coast Conference crown.\n1931–32 season.\nThe injury bug would again bite Ed Lewis during his Junior season. With the Beavers again making a long road trip to California in advance of the Northern Division season, Lewis broke his hand in a game against the University of San Francisco. Lewis managed to tape up and return to game action during conference games, with OSC building a 4 and 1 record before suffering painful losses to Washington and Oregon — the former in overtime and the latter by one point.\nDuring team preparations for a road trip to Washington State and Idaho, Lewis hurt his shoulder in practice, an injury which was aggravated in the contest in Pullman — knocking Lewis out of action again. The Beavers once again faded late in the year, with only two consecutive victories over the University of Oregon to close the season keeping Lewis and the Beavers out of fourth place in the five team Northern Division.\nDespite his injuries, Ed Lewis would finish the season tied for second in OSC team scoring with 123 points.\n1932–33 season.\nEd Lewis' Senior season would prove to be an altogether different story. During the 1932–33 season Lewis was tapped as team captain by the Beavers and he led them to their first title in the Pacific Coast Conference since 1924–25. During this senior campaign Lewis led the PCC in scoring, averaging 10.4 points per game, and was selected as an All-American.\nFormer teammate and sports historian James Heartwell was effusive in singing the praises of Ed Lewis in making this PCC championship possible:\nAAU basketball.\nAfter graduation from Oregon State College, Lewis relocated to San Francisco, California, where he played AAU basketball for the Olympic Club.\nIn 1999, an aging Lewis recalled his game to a Salem news reporter with the following words: \"I played like a point guard does now. I was clever with my hands, dribbling and feeding off, I had good peripheral vision and I loved to pass.\"\nAfter sports.\nDuring World War II Lewis served in the US Army for two years, assigned to the Pacific front and spending most of his time stationed on the island of Luzon in The Philippines.\nAfter the war, Lewis and his wife moved to Portland, where he went to work for the Associated Oil Company (Flying A). He would stay in the oil business for the rest of his working life, moving to Salem in 1956 to open the Ed Lewis Oil Company, a distributorship.\nLewis was married and had two children. He was an avid golfer and maintained a 17-handicap into his eighties.\nEd Lewis died in Salem on January 29, 2006. He was 95 years old at the time of his death.\nHonors.\nEd Lewis was named to the 1933 All-Pacific Coast Conference Team and to the 1933 All-American Team. Lewis thus became the first Oregon State player named a consensus first-team All-American.\nIn 1962 Oregon State established the Ed Lewis Award, an honor presented annually to the Oregon State men's basketball player that demonstrates the most leadership.\nIn 1980 Ed Lewis was named to the State of Oregon Sports Hall of Fame. He was named to the Pacific-10 Conference's Hall of Honor in 2005.\nEd Lewis' jersey number 25 was retired by Oregon State in 1999. It remains one of only five such retired by the OSU men's basketball program, the others belonging to Mel Counts, Steve Johnson, A.C. Green, and Gary Payton."

This tournament was set to be the second post-pandemic import-laden conference known as the 2023 Premier Volleyball League Reinforced Conference, with the Angels set to defend their crown, but was made into a second All-Filipino Conference as a consequence of sanctions from the Philippine National Volleyball Federation.\nThe conference not only marked the arrival of two debuting teams – Nxled Chameleons, the sister team of Akari Chargers, and Galeries Tower Highrisers, but it also marked the return of using a cross-over format for the semifinals which was last implemented on the same conference earlier this year which is the 2023 Premier Volleyball League First All-Filipino Conference.

The Philippines would not end their campaign winless after they clinch a victory at China's expense. It would also be the country's first FIBA Basketball World Cup win on home soil, as they were not able to register a victory in their last hosting in 1978.\nAftermath.\nChot Reyes would step down from the head coaching role of the Philippine national team shortly after their final game against China. Reyes has expressed non-interest to get involved in the selection process for his successor who is expected to guide the Philippines at the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou, China.\nThe Philippines failed to qualify directly for the men's basketball tournament of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris via finishing as the best team from FIBA Asia. It was Japan that was able to qualify through this route. The Philippines however qualified for the 2024 FIBA Men's Olympic Qualifying Tournament giving them an alternate route to get into the Olympics."

        "title": "Victoria bid for the 2026 Commonwealth Games",
        "text": "The Victoria bid for the 2026 Commonwealth Games was a bid by Victoria, Australia to host the 2026 Commonwealth Games. The bid was accepted by the Commonwealth Games Federation in August 2022 but was subsequently cancelled in July 2023 by the Victoria State Government.\nThe games were scheduled to take place across four regional sites in the Australian state of Victoria: Geelong, Bendigo, Ballarat and Latrobe Valley. The opening ceremony was to have been held in the state capital Melbourne at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, and the closing ceremony would have been held at Kardinia Park in Geelong. In a departure from previous Commonwealth Games, the event would have been held not in one major city, but across a number of regional cities outside the capital. The Games were scheduled to take place over twelve days between 17 and 29 March 2026. It would have been the sixth time that Australia hosted the Commonwealth Games, with the country previously hosting the Games in 1938, 1962, 1982, 2006 and 2018.\nDevelopment and preparations.\nIn May 2022, the Victorian State Government allocated $2.6 billion to deliver the Commonwealth Games in the years leading to 2026. This money would have been used to build housing, infrastructure and athletes hubs in each of the four regional sites. The Andrews Government said that the priority was to use existing facilities as much as possible, with spending concentrated on supporting infrastructure. The games were to be held in March to avoid clashes with the Australian Football League calendar in Melbourne. In June 2022, the State Government announced Jeroen Weimar had been appointed chief executive of the 2026 Games organising committee. Weimar is a public servant who rose to prominence as the state's COVID-19 Commander in charge of the pandemic response, and had previously served as the CEO of Public Transport Victoria.\nVenue construction and renovations.\nThough details were being released in relation to venue construction and upgrades for the games, all sports had been consolidated along with their locations. On 12 October 2022 the State Government announced a $150 million (AUD) upgrade to Eureka Stadium and its surrounds. Eureka Stadium upgrades would have included expansion of permanent seating from 5,300 to 10–11,000 after the Games, upgrading of the lighting, and the installation of 18,000 temporary seats. Other upgrades to the precinct would have included the addition of a nearby permanent athletics track.\nIn Geelong, the City Hall has identified the construction of a new indoor arena to host the gymnastics and table tennis events as a \"priority project\". Additionally, the Geelong deputy mayor Trent Sullivan has hinted at several possible venues for the Games, including using Eastern Beach as a venue for triathlon and beach volleyball, the newly redeveloped Kardinia Park for cricket T20, and new or upgraded facilities to host aquatics. In July 2022 the state government announced that Stead Park in Corio, a suburb of Geelong, would be upgraded to host the hockey events and have a capacity of 15,000 using a mix of permanent and temporary seating. It is to receive two new international-standard hockey pitches and is planned to become the state's premier field hockey facility. Shepparton would have also hosted some cycling events.\nA temporary pop-up velodrome would have been installed at the Bendigo Showgrounds and shooting was also to be competed in Bendigo.\nInfrastructure.\nIt was expected that the Midland Highway, which links four host cities (Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo and Shepparton) would receive upgrades in time for the games.\nThere was a possibility of a new train station to be constructed in Ballarat near Eureka Stadium, and in Bendigo near the showgrounds, however these were later ruled out due to cost constraints.\nAn athlete's village would have been built in the four host cities, with the villages to be converted to social and affordable housing after the Games. Village locations had been confirmed for the former Saleyards site in Ballarat, at Flora Hill in Bendigo and at Morwell in the Latrobe Valley.\nVenues.\nVenues would have been mostly located within Geelong, Bendigo, Ballarat, Latrobe Valley and the Shepparton region. Melbourne would have hosted the opening ceremony in the Melbourne Cricket Ground, acting as a gateway to the four main regional athletics sites, while the closing ceremony was scheduled for Kardinia Park in Geelong.\nBendigo hub.\n3x3 Basketball and Squash would have taken place in this hub, but venues were not announced prior to Victoria's plan cancellations.\nGeelong hub.\nGolf and Coastal Rowing (in the Bellarine Peninsula and Torquay respectively) would have taken place in this hub, but venues were not announced prior to Victoria's plan cancellations.\nLatrobe Valley hub.\nShooting would have taken place in this hub, but a venue was not announced prior to Victoria's plan cancellations.\nShepparton.\nRoad Cycling would have taken place in this hub, but a venue was not announced prior to Victoria's plan cancellations.\nCeremonies.\nThe opening ceremony was scheduled to take place on 17 March 2026 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The closing ceremony was scheduled to take place on 29 March 2026 at Kardinia Park, during which the Commonwealth Games Federation flag would have been handed over to the representatives of the 2030 Commonwealth Games, which will be known as the Centenary Games.\nPlanned sports.\nUnder new rules designed to encourage cities to bid for the Commonwealth Games, the CGF required only two sports must be played in future Games: athletics and swimming. Despite this, sixteen sports were agreed to for the planned 2026 Victorian Games, with a further seven the subject of discussion between the governing bodies and the Victorian Government. The list includes T20 cricket, for which a women's tournament was held at Birmingham 2022, alongside the following: swimming and diving, athletics, badminton, boxing, beach volleyball, cycling, gymnastics, hockey, lawn bowls, netball, rugby sevens, squash, table tennis, triathlon and weightlifting. In April 2022, the Indian Olympic Association demanded that the 2026 Games also include archery, shooting and wrestling. In July 2022 the State Government announced that they opened an expressions of interest process for the inclusion of sports beyond the initial 16 planned.\nThe final list of sports was announced in October 2022, with the addition of 3x3 Basketball, 3x3 Wheelchair Basketball, Shooting, Shooting Para Sport, Mountain Bike Cross Country, Track Cycling and Para Cycling Track added, along with the debut at Commonwealth Games of coastal rowing, golf and BMX. There will be a total of 21 sports and 26 disciplines, of which ten are fully integrated Para sports. Judo, wrestling and rhythmic gymnastics were dropped after featuring in the 2022 Games.\nCancellation.\nOn 18 July 2023, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews and Deputy Premier Jacinta Allan announced the state government intended to cancel the 2026 Victorian Games. Fifteen months after agreeing to host the Games, the Premier said the cost had escalated to an estimated $6–7 billion, double the estimated benefits, and the government could not justify the expense. The state said it would terminate its host agreement with the Commonwealth Games Federation and seek a settlement of the contract.\nThe Premier said the state would redirect $2 billion in funding allocated to the Games to a regional development package of sporting infrastructure and housing, including $1 billion for 1,300 regional affordable and social housing units. It also committed to delivering all of the permanent sporting facility upgrades planned as part of the Victorian Games. The Premier told media: \"What's become clear is that the cost of hosting these Games in 2026 is not the $2.6 billion which was budgeted and allocated. I will not take money out of hospitals and schools to host an event that is three times the cost estimated and budgeted for last year.\"\nAustralian athletes and representatives of regional Victoria expressed disappointment at the decision. The Commonwealth Games Federation blamed decisions taken by the Victorian government for the cost overruns and the head of the Commonwealth Games Australia described the estimated $6–7 billion figure as an exaggeration. The Andrews government had already allocated $2.6 billion to the Games in its 2022 budget and was seeking a 50–50 funding commitment from the Federal Government, but had not received any funding commitment.\nFollowing the announcement, all Australian state and territory leaders ruled out hosting the Games due to the expected costs and short timeframe. The South Australian government said it had previously examined hosting the Games in Adelaide, but concluded it would cost $3.5 billion with only $1.2 billion in benefits.\nAfter it was announced that other states in Australia ruled out hosting, other countries explored the possibility of hosting the games."

Contested over 90 laps on the road course, it was the 25th race of the 2023 NASCAR Cup Series season.\nReport.\nBackground.\nWatkins Glen International (nicknamed \"The Glen\") is an automobile race track located in Watkins Glen, New York at the southern tip of Seneca Lake. It was long known around the world as the home of the Formula One United States Grand Prix, which it hosted for twenty consecutive years (1961–1980), but the site has been home to road racing of nearly every class, including the World Sportscar Championship, Trans-Am, Can-Am, NASCAR Cup Series, the International Motor Sports Association and the IndyCar Series.\nInitially, public roads in the village were used for the race course. In 1956 a permanent circuit for the race was built. In 1968 the race was extended to six hours, becoming the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen. The circuit's current layout has more or less been the same since 1971, although a chicane was installed at the uphill Esses in 1975 to slow cars through these corners, where there was a fatality during practice at the 1973 United States Grand Prix. The chicane was removed in 1985, but another chicane called the \"Inner Loop\" was installed in 1992 after J.D. McDuffie's fatal accident during the previous year's NASCAR Winston Cup event.\nThe circuit is known as the Mecca of North American road racing and is a very popular venue among fans and drivers. The facility is currently owned by International Speedway Corporation.\nPractice.\nA. J. Allmendinger was the fastest in the practice session with a time of 1:11.148 seconds and a speed of .\nQualifying.\nDenny Hamlin scored the pole for the race with a time of 1:10.392 and a speed of .\nRace.\nRace results.\nStage results.\nStage One\n\"Laps:\" 20\nStage Two\n\"Laps:\" 20\nFinal Stage results.\nStage Three\n\"Laps:\" 50\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nUSA covered the race on the television side. as part of a Radio style Broadcast for the race.

Marty Snider, Kim Coon, and Dillon Welch handled the pit road duties from pit lane.\nRadio.\nMotor Racing Network had the radio call for the race, which was also simulcast on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio. Alex Hayden, Jeff Striegle, and former crew chief Todd Gordon covered the action when the field raced down the front straightaway. Dave Moody called the race when the field raced thru the esses.

        "text": "William Charles Putnam (August 12, 1922 – December 12, 1992) was an American college basketball player for the UCLA Bruins. He earned second-team All-American honors in 1945, when he helped lead the Bruins to their first basketball championship, winning the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) Southern Division title. Putnam was later an assistant coach and assistant athletic director at UCLA. He was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame.\nEarly life.\nPutnam was born on August 12, 1922, in San Francisco. His father, George, was part owner of the San Francisco Seals baseball team. Putnam's family moved to Sacramento, California, in the early 1930s. Growing up there, he began playing basketball in the 10th grade at McClatchy High School. He was the school's first four-sport athlete, competing also in football, baseball and track and field.\nCollege playing career.\nPutnam played basketball at Sacramento City College (SCC) from 1940 to 1942, leading the Panthers to two second-place finishes in a then-15-team conference. The , guard transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles, to play for the Bruins under coach Wilbur Johns. Putnam and fellow junior college transfer Don Barksdale joined UCLA midseason in 1942–43, following the Bruins' loss of Johnny Fryer, an Army reserve who was called to serve in World War II. While Barksdale played, Johns chose to keep Putnam inactive and preserve a year of his eligibility.\nPutnam started at guard for UCLA in 1943–44. As co-captain of the Bruins with Bill Rankin in 1944–45, he helped lead the team to its first basketball championship, winning the PCC Southern Division title with a 34–28 victory over their crosstown rivals, USC. The Bruins were not able to face the Northern Division champion in a playoff due to scheduling conflicts arising from UCLA's roster being all Navy trainees. Putnam was named a second-team All-American by the Helms Athletic Foundation, becoming the UCLA basketball program's second All-American, and he was a unanimous selection to the All-PCC Southern Division team.\nPutnam also earned a letter in football in 1944. He was posthumously named to the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame in 1993, and the SCC Men's Basketball Court of Honor in 2001.\nLater years.\nIn 1945, Putnam played on the 20th Century-Fox team that advanced to the consolation round of the Amateur Athletic Union's national basketball tournament, finishing in fourth place.\nAfter graduating from college in 1945, Putnam was an assistant coach under Johns for one season in 1946–47, and later under John Wooden from 1948 to 1963. Wooden called him \"one of the most loyal, hard-working coaches who ever worked with me\". Additionally in 1948, Putnam became an assistant director of athletics under Johns; Putnam was responsible for UCLA athletic teams' travel arrangements. He was also the Bruins' junior varsity head coach for two seasons. He left UCLA in 1963, and started a career in real estate in Southern California. \nPutnam died of a heart attack on December 12, 1992, while returning home from a UCLA basketball game at Pauley Pavilion against San Diego. He was 70."

The IHF received three bids.\nOn 12 August 2023, The IHF decided to award the hosting rights to China, with the goal of sparking the growth of Handball in the non-traditional Handball country. This is the first time an Asian country has organised this event and the first time since 2010 that the tournament will be held outside of Europe.\nDraw.\nThe draw was held on 13 April 2024 in Ulm, Germany."

        "title": "1929–30 Bowdoin Polar Bears men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1929–30 Bowdoin Polar Bears men's ice hockey season was the 11th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nBefore the season began, a question was asked of approximately 200 Bowdoin student if they were in favor of abolishing any of the active athletic programs. While a vast majority (145) wanted to retain all sports, 31 suggested dropping one of the programs. Of these, only one person put forth ice hockey to be abandoned, which was fewer than basketball (2), baseball (8), and fencing (22) among others. The relative popularity of hockey in this regard, along with the recent success, gave a good indication as to the stability of the program and its likelihood of survival. These questions were more pressing than usual in the wake of the stock market crash, particularly as Bowdoin was a small college and did not have the funding to support an infinite number of athletic programs. While the program was likely to stick around, its hopes of getting an indoor rink would have to be put off to a later date despite continued cries for its approval.\nOff-ice issues aside, the team entered the year looking to win a third consecutive state title and had several returning players to help the Bears along. While most positions were covered, the biggest question mark was in goal where coach Houser had no one on hand with any varsity experience. By the second week of December the rink was up and ready and the team was only waiting for the ice to form. As was typical, the weather prevented any on-ice practice from occurring until early January so the Bears had to stay in shape with games of 'Houserball'.\nThe Bears were only able to get in one practice before the first game but still managed to pull off a win. the two most veteran players, Bob Thayer and team captain Stuart Stone, were towers on defense and helped Drew keep the Garnet from scoring but once in the match. Souther, a reserve wing, got the team off and running with the first goal and was soon followed by a second from Ward. The Bears were able to hold onto their lead for the duration of the game and jump to the top of the in-state standings. After a match with New Hampshire was postponed and later scrapped due to poor ice, the Polar Bears continued their Maine campaign with a visit from Colby. The Mules offense looked far more composed that Bowdoin's, who were still suffering from a lack of training time. Thayer made several sprints up the ice but found himself alone most of the time and was unable to score by himself. Colby, meanwhile, was able to effectively pass the puck between its three forwards and overcome the stout Bear defense. Hirtle got his first turn in goal in the third period but he was unable to turn the tide and the Mules took the lead in the state series.\nCoach Houser decided to go with Stockman in goal for the next game and the change worked. Northeastern peppered the Bowdoin cage with shots but only one managed to find its way into the goal. The inspiring netminding buoyed the rest of the team and spurred on the rest of the Polar Bears who hardly looked anything like the men who had lost to Colby. Rose made a beautiful pass to Dwyer for the first goal and then, after the game had been tied, fished the puck out of a melee of players and roofed the game-winner to give Bowdoin its first win over a Boston-area team. After the rematch with Bates was postponed, the team headed down to face Boston University. The team ended up having to rely on Dennison in goal, the fourth goalie in as many games. Worse, the team regressed back into the same squad that had lost to Colby and played more like a collection of individuals rather than a team. Stone's lone goal came after the game was already well out of hand.\nFor the rematch with Colby, it appeared the team had recollected itself and the offense finally got on track. After the Mules opened the scoring, Bilodeau and Ward each scored twice over a 20-minute span to give the Bears a commanding lead. Colby, however, refused to stay down and scored three times in the final 20 minutes to tie the game. In the second 5-minute overtime, the Mules' Delaware skated the length of the ice, danced around Stone and fired the puck into the top of the net. Bowdoin was unable to match the score in the remaining 2 minutes and lost in heartbreaking fashion. The defeat put Bowdoin in a precarious position for the state title and the team could not afford another loss if they wanted to retain the crown.\nThe exam break put the team on the shelf for the better part of three weeks and, once they returned, Bowdoin found that heavy rains had put a damper on their season. Two more matches had to be cancelled but the Bears managed to trek up to Lewiston for a rematch with Bates since their own rink was unusable. With a distinct lack of practice heading into the match, the team looked out of sorts and were easy prey for the Bobcats. Even Thayer and Stone appeared slow in the match that saw Bates take an insurmountable lead in the state series. Because Bates had defeated Colby twice in the interim, the Bobcats were guaranteed to win the state title.\nNo ice plagued the team for the remainder of the year and the Polar Bears looked like a shell of their early-season selves in the final two games. Northeastern was easily able to avenge their earlier loss despite the furious play from some of the players while Bates capped off a successful season with a routine victory in the season finale. The poor finish was blamed primarily on the lack of an indoor rink and calls were renewed for the school to properly support the program.\nF. B. Neal served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1920–21 Dartmouth Indians men's ice hockey season was the 15th season of play for the program. The Indians were coached by Leon Tuck in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nFresh from winning a silver medal at the 1920 Summer Olympics, new head coach Leon Tuck took over a program looking to finally get over the hump. Though they were still forced to use a natural surface for their home rink, Dartmouth was able to gather a team together that looked primed for a championship early. The team won its first three games and then travelled south for its first big test of the year. Unfortunately, the Indians weren't as good on unfamiliar surfaces as they were at home and Dartmouth suffered a pair of embarrassing losses in Boston.\nAfter being shutout in back-to-back games, the Indians returned home and paused for the exam break. When the season resumed in mid-February, the offense was still finding it difficult to score and Dartmouth extended their scoreless streak to three games. The main culprit in the Yale match was the extremely poor ice that caused the game to be called off just 3 minutes into the second period. No such excuse was available in the following game against MIT Engineers and Dartmouth posted a program-worst fourth consecutive game without a single goal to their credit. The Indians were finally able to get on the board against St. Paul's School but extended their winless streak to 5 games and, by all accounts, their season looked like it was spiraling into the abyss.\nThe games against Williams saw the team suddenly change its fortunes. Led by a hat-trick from defenseman J. Philip Bower, the Indians posted their first win in a month and a half. The offensive explosion carried over into the final two games of the year when Dartmouth headed down to Philadelphia for a 2-game stay at the Ice Palace. Dartmouth easily took down a pair of undermanned teams as both Penn and Princeton were missing several of their regulars. The final two games were played with 6-man units with Perry moving from rover to cover point.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1922–23 Massachusetts Agricultural Aggies men's ice hockey season was the 15th season of play for the program. The Aggies were coached by Herbert Collins in his first season.\nSeason.\nIn late November, the hockey team held its first meeting and set about getting ready for the season. While the Aggies were looking at a difficult schedult that include some of the top college teams, MAC also had to deal with some off-ice upheaval. Elton Mansell, the team's leader for the past five years, was now gone. Herbert Collins took over as head coach, however, as he had played with the team over the previous four years the two were well acquainted with one another. The bigger issue was that just two lettermen (Doc Gordon and Shorty Hodsdon) were returning and Collins had to remake the team without a usable ice rink. The venue had been rebuilt by that time but the weather was not cold enough for the surface to freeze and the candidates were forced to train on the floor of Drill Hall. After returning from the winter break, the Aggies were happy to find that cold weather had arrived in the region and were able to get several practice sessions in before the first game.\nThough their practice sessions may have been helpful, the raw team wasn't quite ready in time to face a strong Boston University outfit. Due to an illness, Hodsdon was only able to play for a few minutes in the match, leaving the defense in the lurch. Despite a solid game from Alger, the Aggies surrendered 6 goals in a game that was never close. The experience the team gained, however, seemed to work wonders as MAC was much more competitive in their next match. Originally, the Aggies were supposed to play at Williamstown but the game was moved due to a lack of ice on the Ephs home rink. The game was fast from the start and MAC looked like a completely different team. Hodsdon, now recovered, played the entire game and gave a big boost to the defense. The two teams traded goals in the first and second periods and were unable to break the deadlock in regulation. Overtime was needed and both continued to skate up and down the ice but neither goaltender would give an inch. After six 5-minute overtime periods and no further scoring, the teams agreed to call the game a draw. Nearly the same thing happened in the very next game when returned to face Amherst on their rink. This time it was only 1 goal per side that could be recorded but the result was the same. 30 minutes of overtime hockey was not enough to settle the score and both teams were too exhausted by the end to continue further.\nA few days later, the Aggies played host to a rather unique team from the American School of Osteopathy. Hailing from Missouri, the osteopaths were taking a tour of the region and it was unknown if the match could be played due to rain leading up to the game. While the two were able to play, the poor condition of the ice slowed the pace down and limited the game to 12-minute periods. The only goal was scored by Gordon after a brilliant individual effort and gave the Aggies their first win of the year. Gordon kept rolling in the next game, scoring all three of the team's goals in their win over Cornell. Twice the Big Red managed to tie the score but Alger and Hodsdon combined to prevent a third marker and signify that the team had rounded into form.\nWarm weather afterwards caused the postponement of the rematch with Amherst and hamstrung the team in their training for the contest with Dartmouth. By the time the Aggies made it to Hanover they were completely out of sorts and were swept off the ice by the Greens. It was only through a brilliant performance by Alger that limited Dartmouth to 5 goals. Afterwards, the ice rink in Amherst had recovered enough for the game with the Lord Jeffs to be held. On a brilliant play where he first stole the puck from a Sabrina and then dashed up the ice, Goldsmith fired the puck into the top corner of the net for his first goal of the year. Unfortunately, that was all MAC could produce and the team fell to their cross-town rivals.\nProspects for a win did not look good heading into the match with Army as MAC was still without usable ice and the Cadets had just shut down Dartmouth. Defying expectations, Gordon used a surprisingly fast surface to terrorize the West Pointers all night and even managed to open the scoring in the first period. Army tied the match early in the third but the work by Goldsmith prevented them from adding any more to their total. Goldsmith then turned defense into offense by stealing the puck in front of his own goal and skated up the ice. His rush ended with a shot from the middle of the ice that found its way into the cage and won the match for the Aggies. With a winning season in the balance, MAC headed south to take on Yale. The team was able to keep pace with the Bulldogs early as both outfits played a fast game. Captain Gordon tied the game in the first after his Yale counterpart started the scoring but the Elis managed a second goal before the frame was over. Yale was able to use its bevy of alternates to keep the blistering pace while the Aggies slowly succumbed. Down 1–4 entering the third, MAC got its second wind and attempted to stage a comeback but the Yale defense was too strong. The team was forced to concede defeat and returned home with a losing record.\nErnest Putnam served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "Samsunspor (basketball)",
        "text": "Samsunspor, also known as Reeder Samsunspor for sponsorship reasons, is a Turkish professional basketball club based in Samsun. Founded in 1965, the club is the basketball section of the multi-sport club Samsunspor and currently competes in the Basketbol Süper Ligi, the top-tier basketball league in Turkey.\nHistory.\nSamsunspor, which was established in 1927 and became a professional club in 1965, had a basketball branch according to the information provided in its registration document. The professional basketball team was established on December 3, 1966, following the start of the professional league.\nIn 1967, the basketball team, composed almost entirely of the squad from 19 Mayıs High School, started playing their home matches at Yaşar Doğu Sports Hall, which was opened the same year. They played their first match against the soldiers of the American radar base in Samsun. Within three years, the basketball team showed significant progress and became one of the strong teams in Anatolia.\nAfter winning the local league in 1967 and participating in the 1967 Anatolian Cup, the team became champions in the 1970 Anatolian Cup. They also successfully completed the promotion matches in Bolu, earning a place in the Turkish Basketball First League for the first time. The championship squad of Samsunspor included Osman Şenher, Cudi İmamoğulları, Ferit Bestami, Uğur Pehlivan, Kaya Akal, Ertuğrul Bayraktar, Samet İmamoğulları, Yalçın Gürpınar, and two American players.\nSamsunspor finished the 1971–72 season, their first season in the Turkish Basketball First League, as champions by losing only one match in the final week against Yenişehir. This achievement granted them the right to compete in the Turkish National Basketball League, alongside teams from Ankara, İzmir, and Istanbul, making them the first team outside of these cities to earn that opportunity. The starting lineup consisting of Tansev Mıhçıoğlu, İsmet Badem, Cudi İmamoğulları, İren İmre, and Yalçın Gürpınar played a key role in winning this championship. However, the club began to face financial difficulties following this success and couldn't pay the players' salaries. As a result, Samsunspor had to withdraw from the league during the ongoing 1972–73 season and didn't participate in the leagues the following year. During this period, the team disbanded, and the basketball branch was closed.\nAfter the closure of the branch, Samsun DSİ, one of the teams representing Samsun in basketball leagues, achieved promotion to the Turkish Second Division Basketball League in the 1989–90 season. They competed in this league for three seasons. Samsunspor reopened its basketball branch at the beginning of the 1992–93 season under the presidency of \"İsmail Uyanık\", a former basketball player. They acquired the competitive rights of Samsun DSİ and incorporated players from Samsun Yolspor. Due to insufficient infrastructure, the team had to relinquish its right to promotion to the Turkish Basketball First League in the 2001–02 season. However, in the 2004–05 season, thanks to İsmail Uyanık's personal efforts, they managed to regain promotion to the Turkish Basketball First League. Unfortunately, despite participating in the fixture draw and having Panasonic as their name sponsor, the team decided to withdraw from the league due to insufficient support from the new management after İsmail Uyanık stepped down as president.\nThe revival of the branch occurred once again during İsmail Uyanık's presidency, prior to the 2019–20 season, by taking over the basketball team competing in the Turkish Basketball Second League from Samsun Büyükşehir Belediyesi Anakent. After acquiring the team, an application was made to participate in the Turkish Basketball First League due to the withdrawal of some teams, which resulted in available slots. Samsunspor's application was accepted, and they started the new season competing in this league. The Mustafa Dağıstanlı Sports Hall was designated as the venue for training sessions and home matches.\nAfter the end of the season, a restructuring took place in basketball, where the branch, formerly a part of Samsunspor, was transformed into an independent entity under the name of Samsunspor Basketbol club. In the 2019–20 season, the team, which was in the relegation zone, managed to stay in the league as the leagues were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. Subsequently, the club underwent administrative restructuring and was once again made a branch under Samsunspor. Emre Ekim was appointed as the general manager, and the squad was revamped.\nIn the 2020–21 season, Samsunspor finished in second place in the regular season but was eliminated in the finals of the playoff series, failing to promote to the higher league. In the 2021–22 season, Samsunspor finished the season in second place again, and were eliminated in the playoff finals. In the 2022–23 season, the team competed under the name \"Yılyak Samsunspor\" due to a sponsorship agreement. They completed the season as the playoff champions and earned promotion to the Basketbol Süper Ligi.\nHonours.\nTurkish Basketball First League\nAnatolian Cup"

In March 2023, it was announced that Saskatoon had been awarded a WCBL expansion franchise that would begin play in 2024. The franchise is owned by Saskatoon Entertainment Group, run by father–son business partners Mike and Colin Priestner, which also owns the Saskatchewan Rush of the National Lacrosse League and the Saskatoon Blades of the Western Hockey League. The group signed a 10-year lease at Cairns Field and stated its intent to upgrade the facilities there. The owners also planned to increase fan engagement over the Yellow Jackets era, and began with fan voting to name the new team. In July 2023, fans voted on the name, and Berries won over the other finalists, which included the Bridge Pigeons, Cobra Chickens, and River Pirates. Club president Steve Hildebrand called the name \"uniquely Saskatoon.\" Before the end of the month, the team also unveiled its logo and team colours. The team plans to unveil the rest of its branding before the end of 2023.\nIn July, 2023, the Berries hired Joe Carnahan as its coach. Carnahan was a four-time WCBL coach of the year as manager for the Swift Current 57's, the team he helped lead to the WCBL championship three times. He also won three titles as a player for the 57's."

        "title": "1928–29 Bowdoin Polar Bears men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1928–29 Bowdoin Polar Bears men's ice hockey season was the 10th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAs the players were getting ready for the first meeting in November, a slate of 11 games was put together for the Polar Bears. The weather in recent years had not been kind to the program as many games had to be cancelled, however, every scheduled match gave the team a chance to play even if a contest were postponed to a later date. With that in mind, seven games were set to take place in January and while that was typically a poor month for ice conditions, the relatively open schedule in February could absorb some of those game if necessary. An unexpected problem for the team was captain-elect Preston Rice had not returned to campus after the summer break and Bowdoin would need to pick a new leader for the team. Fortunately, Coach Houser had plenty men to pick from as 40 candidates showed up for the first practice with five lettermen returning. Due to a lack of ice, the team was forced to use whatever was at their disposal including a partially-frozen Harpswell Pond. Nothing, however, could help the team as much as a full on-ice practice.\nDespite the problems, the team opened the season with a win, pulling away from Bates after two overtime periods. The Bobcats opened the scoring early but were unable to build on their lead thanks to the stellar goaltending of Tubby Howland. Tiemer tied the game midway through the second and the score remained unchanged until the end of regulation. After a fast first overtime, the game slowed down in the second 5-minute session but Bob Thayer had enough left in the tank to net the winning goal. The team headed south to see if it had improved since the previous year but ended up losing a third consecutive game to Boston University by a 3-goal margin. The lack of practice was the biggest culprit in Bowdoin's loss, as the team had only been able to hold practice on three occasions, but the Polar Bears still gave the Terriers a fight. The following night the team faced New Hampshire and coach Houser flipped the wingers to see if that could spark some offense. The plan didn't work and Bowdoin was shutout by the Wildcats. The Bears' defense was displayed prominently in the match but an ineffective attack saw the team unable to capitalize on their scoring chances.\nBowdoin returned home to fine that the weather had been kind and gave them a perfect sheet of ice for the rematch with Bates. Tiemer got the team off to a fast start with 2 goals in 6 seconds through the Garner were able to cut into the lead before the end of the first period. From then on the game took on a physical tone and both teams tried to batter the other into submission. Interspersed between mad dashes up the ice, the players threw their bodies at one another. Though they were sometimes called for penalties, neither team could find the net for the remainder of the contest and Bowdoin was ale to put itself into prime position for another state championship. A subsequent game with Colby saw the Bowdoin earn at least a share of the title with Tiemer's second 2-goal performance headlining the victory. Just before the exam break, the team got a match in with Massachusetts Agricultural and continued its strong defense play. Not only did Bowdoin hold the Aggies to a single goal but both defensemen scored in the match, the final coming from Stone in the waning moments of the third period.\nThe Polar Bears returned from the exam break by electing Howland as team captain. The team also welcomed in Don Sloan but the starting lineup remained unchanged. In the final match with Colby, the defense was its usual stout force and stopped many a rush from Colby. Unfortunately, the offense was typical as well with Tiemer being the only player to score in the first two periods. This allowed a quick shot from the Mules to tie the score 5 minutes into the third, however, Dwyer's first goal of the season with just 75 seconds left gave Bowdoin the win. The victory guaranteed a state championship for Bowdoin as they had twice beaten their in-state opponents but there was still one game left to play. The following night Bates arrived in town but, with little to play for, coach Houser decided to use a mostly reserve lineup to give the seconds some ice time. The result was a win for Bates but that didn't materially change anything for the Bears.\nWith a championship in their back pocket, the Bears welcomed MIT to the delta that weekend. While neither team was particularly good on offense, the goaltenders performed remarkably with both stopping more than 20 shots in the match. The puck got by Captain Howland just once but that was enough for the Engineers to take the game. Due to warm weather the final two games were cancelled but that didn't dampen one of the most successful seasons that Bowdoin had yet produced.\nCarl Moses served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;\nScoring statistics.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 1920–21 Massachusetts Agricultural Aggies men's ice hockey season was the 13th season of play for the program. The Aggies were coached by Elton Mansell in his 4th season.\nSeason.\nThe season began with the school building a new rink near Alumni Field which was supposed to have more consistent ice and cut down on the number of games lost to the weather. The veteran team, led by Justin \"Jerry\" McCarthy, was expected to compete against some of the best teams in college hockey.\nAfter returning from the winter break, the team opened with an exhibition game against the Springfield Hockey Club to help get them into shape for the season. The first official game happened a few days later when they met cross-town rival Amherst and won a narrow victory. Though the score was close, MAC carried the balance of play and allowed just 7 shots from the Lord Jeffs. New entry Harold Poole was integral in keeping Phil Newell's crease clear all night and even managed to open the scoring. A few days later the team travelled up to New Hampshire to take on Dartmouth. The two fought a mostly even battle in the first with coach/rover Sonny Mansell leading the charge but it was the greens who ended the first half on top by a pair. Both squads increased the pace of play in the second half but a pair of quick goals saw the score tied by the efforts of the Aggies' offense. A fast overtime saw both teams get their chances before the Dartmouth captain, Rothchild, netted the winning goal, in the second 5-minute period.\nThe next game saw the Aggies take on the best team in the nation when they faced off against Harvard. The Crimson were already well on their way to winning another championship but Mansell's men were undaunted. In possibly their best and fastest game of the year, nearly every player was an equal to their Harvard counterpart but the Aggies could not overcome the conditioning of the Crimson skaters. Harvard scored twice in the third to take the match but the Aggies had still proven themselves as a worthy opponent.\nA lack of ice caused the next two games to be postponed which left the Aggies with little practice time ahead of their game with Fordham. The team had a letdown against the Maroons, which was played on a very strange surface. The small 181st Street Ice Palace was not normally used as an ice hockey rink and the two were restricted to 6-players per team. Additionally, the ice had 4 pillars arranged about 20 feet from the boards on either side. Because Fordham used the venue for its practice the team was used to avoiding these impediments while MAC found it very difficult to contend with the obstacles. Worse, the team was called for 5 separate penalties in the game which only served to boost Fordham to a 3–8 drubbing of the Aggies. MAC returned to Boston for a match with Boston College and returned to their earlier form, however, they still ended up on the losing side of the ledger. The two goaltenders starred for most of the match but the forwards shone briefly with spectacular individual efforts. McCarthy's goal came when he stole the puck in front of the BC cage and then whipped it into the goal in one motion. Unfortunately, the final goal came after a blistering run up the ice by Frank Morrissey that culminated with the winning goal. The next night, the Aggies were finally able to end their losing streak by taking down MIT. Newell played another strong game in goal and every save was needed as the teams were tied for most of the match. Mansell broke the tie in the third with a charge from his own zone and beating the Engineer netminder with a quick shot.\nMAC was finally able to get in a home game when they played Tufts two days later and were in control of the match from start to finish. Mansell started the scoring in the first half and ended with a hat-trick while four others added scores to finish with a 8–0 win. While the team had a few games left on its schedule, every subsequent match was cancelled due to a lack of ice, thanks to warm weather.\nJoseph Evers served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

Paddlers complete up to two runs in the heats, with the top ranked athletes starting last. In the first heat, the 30 fastest paddlers qualify automatically for the semifinal, whilst the rest compete in the second heat for additional 10 qualification spots. The final rank of non-qualifying athletes is determined by their second run score. Paddlers start in the reverse order of their heats position in the semifinal and complete a single run, with the top 10 advancing to the final. The start list for the final is once again in reverse order of the semifinal results. The athlete with the best time in the single-run final is awarded gold.\nA penalty of 2 seconds is awarded for touching a gate and a 50-second penalty is awarded for missing a gate or negotiating it in the opposite direction.\nAn easier gate setup is generally used for the heats and then a more difficult one for semifinal and final.\nResults.\nPenalties are included in the time shown. The fastest time in each round is shown in bold."

        "text": "The Victorian Cycling Grand Prix was a one-day classic road bicycle race held in October 1946. It was the longest and richest cycling race held in Australia that year, and at the time was the longest one-day road cycling event ever staged in Victoria.\nProfessional cycling events in Australia were largely suspended in the years from 1940 to 1945 as a result of the Second World War, and 1946 the Victorian Cycling Grand Prix was held in October at around the time the Warrnambool to Melbourne one-day classic had been held in the pre-war years. The Grand Prix was described at the time as \"the cycling classic of the year\" and \"Australia's 1946 cycling classic\" and the winner (Phil Thomas, SA) was lauded as the \"outstanding professional roadman in Australia in 1946\" as a result of his victory in the race. Unlike the Warrnambool to Melbourne, the event was a Scratch Race with a massed start of close to 100 entrants, categorised into A, B and C grades. The event also carried the Victorian Long Distance Championship for 1946. \nThe race covered , starting in Bendigo at 5:50am before passing through Castlemaine, Maryborough, Ballarat and Geelong and finishing in front of a large crowd of nearly 10,000 at the Melbourne Showgrounds, where a large all-sports carnival was held on the same day. The race was neutralised at Meredith (123 miles) while competitors were transported by truck over six miles of unmade road. Town sprints were contested at many towns along the route, and a large cash prize was available for the best breakaway. The first 20 riders to finish went on to compete in a 3-mile exhibition track race at the Showgrounds that evening."

        "title": "Allegations of corruption and bribery related to the 2022 FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "There have been allegations of bribery or corruption in the 2022 FIFA World Cup selection process involving members of the FIFA Executive Committee. There have been numerous allegations of bribery between the Qatar bid committee and FIFA members and executives, some of whom—including Theo Zwanziger and Sepp Blatter—were later recorded regretting awarding Qatar the tournament.\n2011.\nIn May 2011, allegations of corruption within the FIFA senior officials raised questions over the legitimacy of the World Cup being held in Qatar. According to then vice-president Jack Warner, an email has been publicised about the possibility that Qatar 'bought' the 2022 World Cup through bribery via Mohammed bin Hammam who was president of the Asian Football Confederation at the time. Qatar's officials in the bid team for 2022 have denied any wrongdoing. A whistleblower, revealed to be Phaedra Almajid, alleged that several African officials were paid $1.5m by Qatar. She later retracted her claims of bribery, stating she had fabricated them in order to exact revenge on the Qatari bid team for relieving her of her job with them. She also denied being put under any pressure to make her retraction. FIFA confirmed receiving an email from her which stated her retraction.\n2014–15.\nIn March 2014, it was alleged that a firm linked to Qatar's successful campaign paid committee member Jack Warner and his family almost $2 million. \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that it understands that the U.S. FBI is investigating Warner and his alleged links to the Qatari bid.\nOn 1 June 2014, \"The Sunday Times\" claimed to have obtained documents including e-mails, letters and bank transfers which allegedly proved that Bin Hammam had paid more than 5 million US dollars to Football officials to support the Qatar bid. Bin Hamman and all those accused of accepting bribes denied the charges.\nLater in June 2014, Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker gave an interview to German media in June 2014 stating that the allegations are being driven by envy and mistrust by parties who do not want the World Cup staged in Qatar, and that the country is not getting the respect it deserves over its efforts to hold the World Cup. He reiterated that the Qatari Emir strictly punishes and forbids instances of corruption and bribery with a zero-tolerance policy.\nIn an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\".\nQatar faced growing pressure over its hosting of the World Cup in relation to allegations over the role of former top football official Mohammed bin Hammam played in securing the bid. A former employee of the Qatar bid team alleged that several African officials were paid $1.5 million by Qatar. She retracted her claims, but later said that she was coerced to do so by Qatari bid officials. In March 2014, it was discovered that disgraced former CONCACAF president Jack Warner and his family were paid almost $2 million from a firm linked to Qatar's successful campaign. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is investigating Warner and his alleged links to the Qatari bid.\n\"The Sunday Times\" published bribery allegations based on a leak of millions of secret documents. Five of FIFA's six primary sponsors, Sony, Adidas, Visa, Hyundai, and Coca-Cola, called upon FIFA to investigate the claims. Jim Boyce, vice-president of FIFA, stated he would support a re-vote to find a new host if the corruption allegations are proven. FIFA completed a lengthy investigation into these allegations and a report cleared Qatar of any wrongdoing. Despite the claims, the Qataris insisted that the corruption allegations were being driven by envy and mistrust while Sepp Blatter said it was fueled by racism in the British media.\nIn the 2015 FIFA corruption case, Swiss officials, operating under information from the United States Department of Justice, arrested many senior FIFA officials in Zürich, Switzerland and seized physical and electronic records from FIFA's main headquarters. The arrests continued in the United States, where several FIFA officers were arrested, and FIFA buildings were raided. The arrests were made on the information of at least a $150 million (USD) corruption and bribery scandal.\nOn 7 June 2015, Phaedra Almajid, the former media officer for the Qatar bid team, claimed that the allegations would result in Qatar not hosting the World Cup. In an interview published on the same day, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA's Audit and Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled.\"\nFIFA ethics investigation report.\nIn 2014, FIFA appointed Michael Garcia as its independent ethics investigator to look into bribery allegations against Russia and Qatar, the hosts for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup respectively. Garcia investigated all nine bids and eleven countries involved in the 2018 and 2022 bids and spoke to all persons connected to the bids and appealed for witnesses to come forward with evidence. At the end of investigation, Garcia submitted a 430-page report in September 2015. FIFA governing body then appointed a German judge Hans Joachim Eckert who reviewed and presented a 42-page summary of the report two months later. The report cleared Qatar and Russia of bribery allegations stating that Qatar \"pulled Aspire into the orbit of the bid in significant ways\" but did not \"compromise the integrity\" of the overall bid process.\nMichael Garcia reacted almost immediately stating that the report is “materially incomplete” and with “erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\". In 2017, a German journalist Peter Rossberg who claimed to have obtained the report wrote in a Facebook post that the report \"does not provide the proof that the 2018 or 2022 World Cup was bought\" and stated that he would publish the full report bit by bit. This forced FIFA to release the original report as authored by the investigator Michael Garcia. The full report did not provide any evidence of corruption against the host of 2022 World Cup but stated that bidders tested rules of conduct to the limit. The report ended talks of a re-vote.\n2020.\nIn January, Bonita Mersiades, a whistle-blower from inside Australia's 2022 World Cup bid published a book alleging that leading up to the December 2010 vote, executives with FIFA had been privately worried about a financial shortfall for 2022 if Qatar was chosen, when Al Jazeera (now beIN Sports) agreed a secret deal to pay $100 million in the event that Qatar would host. According to the book, the deal involved Jérôme Valcke, secretary general of FIFA at the time; Valcke was later banned from football for nine years due to corruption. When \"The Mail on Sunday\" asked beIN Sports about the allegations, a spokesman described the payment as \"production contributions\" which were \"standard market practice and are often imposed upon broadcasters by sports federations and sports rights holders\".\nAccording to leaked documents obtained by \"The Sunday Times\", Qatari state-run television channel Al Jazeera secretly offered $400 million to FIFA, for broadcasting rights, just 21 days before FIFA announced that Qatar would hold the 2022 World Cup. The contract also documented a secret TV deal between FIFA and Qatar's state-run media broadcaster Al Jazeera that $100 million would also be paid into a designated FIFA account only if Qatar was selected in the World Cup ballot in 2010. A further $480 million was offered by the State of Qatar government, three years after the initial offer, bringing the total amount offered by Qatar to $880 million. The documents were handed over to Swiss Police as part of their bribery inquiry.\nFIFA refused to comment on the inquiry and responded to \"The Sunday Times\" in an email and wrote \"allegations linked to the FIFA World Cup 2022 bid have already been extensively commented by FIFA, who in June 2017 published the Garcia report in full on Fifa.com. Furthermore, please note that Fifa lodged a criminal complaint with the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland, which is still pending. FIFA is and will continue to cooperate with the authorities.\" A beIN spokesman said in a statement that the company would not \"respond to unsubstantiated or wildly speculative allegations.\"\nDamian Collins, a British Member of Parliament (MP) and chairman of a UK parliamentary committee, called for payments from Al Jazeera to be frozen and launched an investigation into the apparent contract since the contract \"appears to be in clear breach of the rules\".\nFormer UEFA president Michel Platini was arrested by French police on 18 June 2019 in relation to the rewarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. He was detained at the Anti-Corruption Office of the Judicial Police outside Paris. The arrest represents the first substantial public move in an investigation into the Qatar decision opened two years ago by France's Parquet National Financier, which is responsible for law enforcement against serious financial crime."

        "title": "Criticisms of Qatar's suitability to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "There were various criticisms of Qatar's suitability to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, with the belief that it was unfit leading to allegations of corruption and bribery in the bidding process based on the belief that the unsuitability would have prevented it from being selected as host without corruption at play. There was further criticism in the run-up to, and at, the World Cup, as unsuitable factors including the climate, cost, and elements of Qatari culture clashing with international tourism, came to the fore.\nFacilities and location.\nStadiums.\nInvolvement of Albert Speer.\nAlbert Speer (Jr), son of Hitler's chief architect and Minister of Armaments and War Production Albert Speer (Sr), was given the responsibility of designing the stadiums for the 2022 Qatar World Cup. Barney Ronay, a senior sportswriter with \"The Guardian\", expressed disbelief that the Qatar Supreme Committee thought it \"the best vibe, the best shout\" to involve an architect who is reminiscent of the Nazis.\nHowever, according to \"Der Spiegel\", \"Speer's stadium designs are a significant reason why Qatar was awarded the 2022 football World Cup.\"\nEnvironmental impact.\nEach stadium in Qatar requires 10,000 litres of water per day in winter months, when the tournament is taking place, to maintain the pitch. With little access to freshwater in the nation, the sourced water was saltwater, which has to be desalinated. The process damages the marine environment. Desalination plants in the Middle East also heavily rely on the use of fossil fuels. As well as the pitches at the stadiums, the organising committee grew and maintained a large farm of match-suitable fresh grass outside Doha, in case of turf damage. The need for so much desalination, and the oil and gas used to power the plants, have been criticised.\nOne of the eight stadiums, Stadium 974, was designed to be able to be disassembled so that it could be moved elsewhere, in an effort to counter the negative effect of requiring upkeep of unused stadiums. The large PR campaign promoting this was criticised by activists, as it overlooked the other stadiums being constructed in Qatar. Stadium 974 and the organising committee pledge that the tournament would be carbon neutral were also criticised as attempts to greenwash Qatar, the nation with the highest per-capita emissions, especially as carbon neutrality was planned to be achieved by planting trees to offset emissions generated by the tournament, rather than use alternative energies. Stadium 974, located at a port, does not have air conditioning; due to the climate of Qatar, the other seven stadiums do, with the systems running on fossil fuels.\nAccommodation.\nIn the days leading up to the tournament, videos emerged of the tournament accommodation, which consisted of shipping containers, some with a curtain leading to the exterior instead of four solid walls, and portable air conditioners. This accommodation cost over $200 a night. A Greek salad which costs $10, consisting of a small amount of lettuce, one slice of cucumber, and no feta, served in a foam container was criticized as expensive and unpalatable. These criticisms led to comparisons to the ill-fated Fyre Festival. Alcohol, where available, is expensive, with beer being $13.73 for 500ml.\nOne official fan village, comprising hundreds of shipping containers, still resembled a building site less than two days before the first World Cup match. People who had stayed in another village complained about the air conditioning and beds: \"It has been hell. The air con in the cabin barely works and sounds like a [fighter jet] is taking off... [The beds] are rock hard so you might as well sleep on the floor.\" Due to these issues, which Qatar officials say were caused by \"owner and operator negligence\", Qatar offered refunds to fans who were \"severely impacted\".\nThe Rawdat Al Jahhaniya fan village was criticised for its overpriced \"night cabins\" (£185 per night) made out of shipping containers. Tourists complained that the air conditioners in the cabins did not function well, facilities were falling apart, and the sleeping experience did not match their expectations. The BBC reported that the tent accommodation at the Qetaifan Island fan village got criticism for having brown-colored tap water and no air conditioning other than a standing fan. The tent village in Al Khor was criticized for having inconvenient transportation, a lack of alcohol, long waits to check in, and no locks on the tents. The lack of suitable and affordable accommodation raised demand for daily shuttle flights from neighboring areas, such as Dubai, that had adequate numbers of hotel rooms.\nUse of migrant workers.\nThere were criticisms of perceived human rights violations related to the organisation and hosting of this World Cup. There had long been concerns for the state of human rights in Qatar, with the state accused of sportswashing in hosting the World Cup. A large concern in Qatar's hosting of the World Cup was the conditions of migrant workers brought in to build the required infrastructure, including indentured servitude and working conditions leading to deaths.\nOn 23 October 2022, an article published by \"The Guardian\" included statements from migrants working on the World Cup 2022 infrastructure. In a survey of 1,000 low-wage workers, 86% of participants said that the labour changes had improved their lives. Better working conditions are now negotiable, and firms are motivated to offer them in order to attract and keep talent. Legislation has also been proposed on the minimum wage, summertime worker safety, and the election of migrant worker representatives in businesses. Labour mobility is a result of changes to the Kafala system.\nThe United Nations asserted in a report that \"Qatar is transforming\". According to Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, \"the new Kafala system tranche of law will put an end to Kafala and establish a contemporary industrial relations system.\" This was published on 17 October 2019, prior to the World Cup. \nFIFA President Gianni Infantino has defended Qatar's decision to host the tournament. Others have asserted that Qatar has a better human rights record than Russia and China, which were subjected to less harsh criticism for the same problems when hosting important athletic events in the years before the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\nScheduling.\nThe notion of staging the tournament in winter proved controversial; Blatter ruled out a January or February event because it may clash with the 2022 Winter Olympics, while others expressed concerns over a November or December event, because it might clash with the Christmas season (even though Qatar is predominantly Muslim, the players in the tournament are predominantly Christian). The Premier League voiced concern over moving the tournament to the northern hemisphere's winter as it could interfere with the local leagues. FA Chairman Greg Dyke said, shortly after he took his job in 2013, that he was open to either a winter tournament or moving the tournament to another country. FIFA executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said that awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar's desert state was a \"blatant mistake\", and that any potential shift to a winter event would be unmanageable due to the effect on major European domestic leagues.\nIn October 2013, a taskforce was commissioned to consider alternative dates, and report after the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. In early 2014, FIFA Secretary-General Jerome Valcke appeared to preempt this, saying: \"Frankly, I think it will happen between November 15 and the end of December because that is when the weather is more favourable. It's more like springtime in Europe\". This was controversial within FIFA itself, due to a possible conflict with the Christmas season, and Vice-president Jim Boyce responded in saying that \"it absolutely has not been decided as far as the executive committee are concerned.\nIt was agreed all the stakeholders should meet, all the stakeholders should have an input and then the decision would be made, and that decision as far as I understand will not be taken until the end of 2014 or the March executive meeting in 2015. As it stands it remains in the summer with no decision expected until end of 2014 or March 2015\". Another option to combat heat problems was changing the date of the World Cup to the northern hemisphere's winter, when the climate in Qatar would be cooler. However, this proved just as problematic as doing so would disrupt the calendar of a number of domestic leagues, particularly in Europe.\nFranz Beckenbauer, a member of FIFA's executive committee, said Qatar could be allowed to host the 2022 World Cup in winter. He justified his proposal on the grounds that Qatar would be saving money, which otherwise they would have spent in cooling the stadiums. Beckenbauer said: \"One should think about another solution. In January and February you have comfortable there\". \"Qatar won the vote and deserves a fair chance as the first host from the Middle East\". At a ceremony in Qatar marking the occasion of having been awarded the World Cup, FIFA President Sepp Blatter later agreed that this suggestion was plausible, but FIFA later clarified that any change from the bid position of a June–July games would be for the host association to propose. Beckenbauer would later receive a 90-day ban from any football-related activity from FIFA after refusing to cooperate in the investigation of bribery.\nThe notion of holding the Cup during Europe's winter was further boosted by UEFA President Michel Platini's indicating that he was ready to rearrange the European club competitions accordingly. Platini's vote for the summer 2022 World Cup went to Qatar. FIFA President Sepp Blatter also said that despite air-conditioned stadiums the event was more than the games itself and involved other cultural events. In this regard, he questioned if fans and players could take part in the summer temperatures.\nIn addition to objections by European leagues, Frank Lowy, chairman of Football Federation Australia, said a change of the 2022 World Cup date from summer to winter would upset the schedule of the A-League and said they would seek compensation from FIFA should the decision go ahead. Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, stated that they would consider legal action against FIFA because a move would interfere with the Premier League's popular Christmas and New Year fixture programme.\nIn September 2013, it was alleged that FIFA had held talks with broadcasters over the decision to change the date of the World Cup as it doing so could cause potential clashes with other scheduled television programming. The Fox Broadcasting Company who had paid $425 million for the right to broadcast both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups in the US, later voiced anger over the possible season switch, as doing so would clash with that year's NFL season, which takes place in the winter and with whom Fox also has a lucrative broadcasting deal. The network said they bought the rights with the understanding the tournament would take place in the summer, and if the change did go ahead they would seek compensation.\nIn February 2015, FIFA awarded Fox the rights to the 2026 World Cup, without opening it up for bidding with ESPN, NBC, and other interested American broadcasters. Richard Sandomir of \"The New York Times\" reported that FIFA did so to avoid Fox from suing in U.S. courts, which under the American legal system could force FIFA to open up their books and expose any possible corruption. As BBC sports editor Dan Roan observed, \"It does not seem to matter to FIFA that rival networks ESPN and NBC may have wanted to bid, or that more money could have been generated for the good of the sport had a proper auction been held. As ever, it seemed, FIFA was looking after itself\".\nOn 24 February 2015, it was announced that a winter World Cup would go ahead in favour of the traditional summertime event. The event was scheduled to be held between November and December. Commentators noted the clash with the Christmas season was likely to cause disruption, whilst there was concern for how short the tournament was intended to be. It was also confirmed that the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations would be moved from January to June to prevent African players from having a relatively quick two-week turnaround, although the monsoonal rainy season in its host country Guinea starts about that time.\nClimate.\nAs the World Cup usually occurs during the northern hemisphere's summer, the weather in Qatar was a concern with temperatures reaching more than . Two doctors from Qatar's Aspetar sports hospital in Doha who gave an interview in November 2010 to \"Qatar Today\" magazine said the climate would be an issue, stating that the region's climate would \"affect performance levels from a health point of view\" of professional athletes, specifically footballers, that \"recovery times between games would be longer\" than in a temperate climate and that, on the field of play, \"more mistakes would be made\". One of the doctors said that \"total acclimation (to the Qatari climate) is impossible\".\nThe inspection team for evaluating who would host the tournament said that Qatar was \"high risk\" due to the weather. FIFA President Sepp Blatter initially rejected the criticism, but in September 2013 said the FIFA executive committee would evaluate the feasibility of a winter event instead of a summer one.\nMove to November and December.\nOwing to the climate in Qatar, concerns were expressed over holding the World Cup in its traditional time frame of June and July. In October 2013, a task force was commissioned to consider alternative dates and report after the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. On 24 February 2015, the FIFA Task Force proposed that the tournament be played from late November to late December 2022, to avoid the summer heat between May and September and also avoid clashing with the 2022 Winter Olympics in February, the 2022 Winter Paralympics in March and Ramadan in April.\nThe notion of staging the tournament in November was controversial because it would interfere with the regular season schedules of some domestic leagues around the world. Commentators noted the clash with the Christian Christmas season was likely to cause disruption, whilst there was concern about how short the tournament was intended to be. FIFA executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said that awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar was a \"blatant mistake\".\nFrank Lowy, chairman of Football Federation Australia, said that if the 2022 World Cup were moved to November and thus upset the schedule of the A-League, they would seek compensation from FIFA. Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, stated that they would consider legal action against FIFA because a move would interfere with the Premier League's popular Christmas and New Year fixture programme. On 19 March 2015, FIFA sources confirmed that the final would be played on 18 December.\nCritics condemned the Euro-centrism of these allegations, and questioned why global sporting events must be held within the traditional European summer season.\nCost.\nAt an estimated cost of over $220 billion, it is the most expensive World Cup ever held to date; this figure is disputed by Qatari officials, including organising CEO Nasser Al Khater, who said the true cost was $8 billion, and other figures related to overall infrastructure development since the World Cup was awarded to Qatar in 2010.\nBy some estimates, the World Cup is set to cost Qatar approximately US$220 billion (£184 billion). This is about 60 times the $3.5 billion that South Africa spent on the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Nicola Ritter, a German legal and financial analyst, told an investors' summit held in Munich that £107 billion would be spent on stadiums and facilities plus a further £31 billion on transport infrastructure. Ritter said £30 billion would be spent on building air-conditioned stadiums with £48 billion on training facilities and accommodation for players and fans. A further £28 billion will be spent on creating a new city called Lusail that will surround the stadium that will host the opening and final matches of the tournament.\nAccording to a report released in April 2013 by Merrill Lynch, the investment banking division of Bank of America, the organisers in Qatar have requested from FIFA to approve a smaller number of stadiums due to the growing costs. Bloomberg.com said that Qatar wishes to cut the number of venues to 8 or 9 from the 12 originally planned. A report released in December 2010 quoted FIFA President Sepp Blatter as stating that Qatar's neighbours could host some matches during the World Cup. However, no specific countries were named in the report. Blatter added that any such decision must be taken by Qatar first and then endorsed by FIFA's executive committee. Prince Ali bin Al Hussein of Jordan told the Australian Associated Press that holding games in Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, and possibly Saudi Arabia would help to accommodate the people of the region during the tournament.\nQatari football record.\nAt the time of being awarded the tournament in 2010, Qatar was ranked 113 in the world, and had never qualified for the World Cup before. The most prestigious accolade the team had won was the Arabian Gulf Cup twice, both times hosting. Since being awarded the tournament, they have also won the Arabian Gulf Cup for a third time in 2014 and the AFC Asian Cup in 2019. Qatar became the smallest country by land area to host the World Cup (less than half the size of 1954 hosts Switzerland, when the tournament consisted of 16 teams). These facts led some to question the strength of football culture in Qatar and if that made them unsuitable World Cup hosts.\nThe Qatar Football Association has also been known to naturalise players from foreign nations for its own team. Examples include Sebastián Soria, Luiz Júnior and Emerson Sheik. The Qatar FA has previously attempted to offer incentives to uncapped players of other nations to switch allegiance to the Gulf state. These have included the German-based Brazilian trio of Aílton, Dedé and Leandro in 2004 – none of whom have ever played in or have other connections to Qatar – to help their team qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. FIFA blocked the moves and as a result, tightened eligibility requirements for national teams.\nWith a 2–0 loss to Ecuador on the tournament's opening day, Qatar became the first host nation to lose their opening match at the World Cup; Qatar subsequently lost 3–1 to Senegal in their second group match, becoming the first team to be eliminated from the tournament. They lost their final group game 2–0 to the Netherlands, becoming the first and only host to lose all their games, as well as the first host to finish 4th in their group and last overall.\nHuman rights.\nLack of recognition of Israel.\nPossible Israeli qualification.\nThe head of the Qatar bid delegation stated that if Israel were to qualify, they would be able to compete in the World Cup despite Qatar not recognising the state of Israel. Israel ultimately were eliminated during FIFA World Cup qualification, and thus did not compete at the tournament in Qatar.\nTreatment of Jewish and Israeli fans.\nIt was reported that Qatar went back on its word to provide cooked \"kosher\" food and public Jewish prayer services at the 2022 World Cup, banning both activities. Qatar alleged that they could not \"secure\" the safety of publicly praying Jewish tourists, whilst many foreign Jews complained that they subsequently had no food available to eat. It was estimated that 10,000 religious Jews from Israel and around the world arrived to watch the World Cup in Qatar.\nMultiple Israeli reporters at the tournament reported fans from Arab nations waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israeli slogans. Some Israelis reported that they had been escorted out of restaurants when their nationality was revealed. The Israeli government warned its citizens who are travelling to the tournament to hide their Israeli identity out of safety concerns. Moav Vardi of Kan 11 stated that Arab fan chants included, \"You are not welcome here, there is only Palestine, there is no such thing as Israel, Israel does not exist\", with some turning back when the Israeli reporters disclose that they're Jewish. Muslims and Morocco football team players also raised Palestinian flags during the matches.\nQatar had previously promised to provide Jewish tourists with cooked \"kosher\" food and public Jewish prayer services at the 2022 World Cup. However, shortly before the World Cup began, both were banned by Qatar, who claimed it could not secure the safety of Jews.\nQatar alleged that they could not \"secure\" the safety of publicly praying Jewish tourists, whilst many foreign Jews complained that they subsequently had no food available to eat. It was estimated that 10,000 religious Jews from Israel and around the world arrived to watch the World Cup in Qatar.\nWhilst Jewish organisations complained of being unable to find cooked kosher food, the Israeli government said it was happy with the efforts made by Qatar to meet its requests, including kosher food, direct flights from Israel to Qatar, and temporary diplomatic representation in the country. A kosher kitchen under the supervision of Rabbi Mendy Chitrik was open in time for the first match. Rabbi Marc Schneier, president of The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, said he had never asked the Qatari government for cooked food, and he had been the only person in communication with the Qataris regarding making the World Cup experience inclusive for Jews.\nMultiple Israeli reporters at the tournament reported fans from Arab nations waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israeli slogans. Some Israelis reported that they had been escorted out of restaurants when their nationality was revealed. The Israeli government warned its citizens traveling to the tournament to hide their Israeli identity out of safety concerns.\nLack of LGBT rights.\nWhen Qatar was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the choice to do so in a restrictive nation saw much criticism, with several topics becoming the subject of controversy. The security of fans was a point of discussion. Qatari officials stated that all people are welcome as long as they follow the public display of affection laws which apply to everyone. At the World Cup, security officials at stadiums confiscated items of rainbow clothing, flags featuring rainbows, whether Pride-related or not, and reportedly intimidated fans. American journalist Grant Wahl was briefly detained for wearing a t-shirt with a rainbow on it.\nLack of women's rights.\nQatar discriminating against women was also criticised. Women in Qatar have few freedoms, as they must obtain permission from their male guardians to marry, study abroad on government scholarships, work in many government jobs, travel abroad, receive certain forms of reproductive health care, and act as the primary guardian of children, even if they are divorced.\nQatar attracted particular criticism for an incident where a Mexican employee of the World Cup Organizing Committee was accused of allegedly having sex outside of marriage. The woman had previously reported rape, while the male claimed to have been in a relationship with her, after which the woman was investigated for extramarital sex. Women in Qatar face the possible penalty of flagellation and a seven-year prison sentence if convicted for having sex outside of marriage. The criminal case was eventually dropped months after she was allowed to leave Qatar.\nProhibition of alcohol.\nHassan Abdulla al Thawadi, chief executive of the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid, said the Muslim state would also permit alcohol consumption during the event. Specific fan-zones would be established where alcohol could be bought. Although expatriates may purchase alcohol and certain businesses may sell alcohol with a permit, drinking in public is not permitted as Qatar's legal system is based on Sharia.\nIn February 2022, the communications executive director at the supreme committee, Fatma Al-Nuaimi, stated in an interview that alcohol would be available in designated fan zones outside stadiums and in other Qatari official hospitality venues. In July 2022, it was reported that while fans would be allowed to bring alcoholic beverages into the stadiums, alcoholic beverages would not be sold inside the stadiums. But according to a source, \"the plans are still being finalised.\" However, on 18 November 2022, days before the first match, Qatar officially banned alcoholic beverages from sale within the eight stadiums.\nOn 30 November 2022, \"The Times\" published an interview with some female fans attending FIFA World Cup 2022 games, with some of them saying that less drunkenness among other attendees made them feel safer at the stadiums than they expected.\nAs part of the Qatari bid, alcohol was to be permitted to be consumed around the stadiums. This was in contradiction to Qatari law which prohibits public consumption of alcohol and limits its consumption to high-end hotels. It was agreed that Budweiser, FIFA's largest sponsor, would be permitted to sell their beer in designated areas in the stadium. Eight days before the tournament Qatari officials informed AB InBev, the owners of Budweiser, that the beer tents were to be moved to less prominent areas and were no longer authorized inside the stadiums but still within the stadium perimeter.\nTwo days before the tournament, on 18 November 2022, FIFA released a statement that sale points of beer would be removed from stadium perimeters in contradiction to both the Qatari bid and the earlier commitment when the sales were moved outside of the stadiums. FIFA's response was questioned as FIFA had forced recent World Cup hosts, such as Brazil, to change their laws to allow alcohol consumption at matches in line with sponsorship commitments. Alcohol was still permitted, however, inside the fan villages and inside the stadiums in the corporate hospitality boxes, leading to claims of double standards.\nRegarding the last-minute Qatari ban on the sale of beer at the stadiums, Infantino proclaimed in his press conference: \"I think personally, if for three hours a day you cannot drink a beer, you will survive.\""

        "title": "Counter-Strike surfing",
        "text": "\"Counter-Strike\" surfing is a modded game mode based on the \"Counter-Strike\" series of first-person shooter video games. Consisting of custom-created obstacle course levels known as surf maps, players make use of a physics engine glitch to float along inclined planes while propelling themselves forward at high speeds in a manner resembling surfing. Accidentally invented by Charles \"Mariowned\" Joyce in the original \"Counter-Strike\", surf maps gained significant popularity and continued to appear as fan-made levels in every game since. The game mode has been praised by both fans and critics for its casual and relaxing nature compared to typical \"Counter-Strike\" gameplay.\nHistory.\nSliding game modes date back to \"Quake II\", but did not gain significant popularity. The first \"Counter-Strike\" surf map was created in 2004 after Joyce, who had created a custom map called \"Killbox\" (ka_killbox), began to slide off the roof of a house and was able to jump to safety. Realizing this would be fun in and of itself, he began to create a new map solely dedicated to surfing, \"The Gap\" (surf_the-gap). The map solely had a ramp that led to a small platform with a button that would blow up the level. He later began creating more complex maps, such as \"Egypt\", \"Christmas\" and \"Ninja\". He struggled to gain popularity for the mode, leaving open dedicated servers and sometimes being flamed by players who were not able to perform the tricks. However, once he realized that tweaking a setting called \"airaccelerate\" from 10 to 100 would allow for easier movement, the mode took off with players. The mode expanded into a variety of multiplayer games, including \"Team Fortress 2\".\nAround 2008, Joyce gradually phased out of the community, but revealed his integral role in an AskReddit post later on, and was inundated with praise from fans, with some relaying anecdotes about how the maps saved them from depression or suicidal thoughts, causing him to become shocked and emotional. He reiterated that he did not claim to invent the idea of sliding in shooter games, but was the first to create dedicated maps and coin the term \"surfing\" in relation to them. He continued working on surf maps, creating \"surf_eventide\" in 2020.\nGameplay.\nSurfing modes are accessed from the game's built-in server browser, and present obstacle-course-like levels that are dependent on players properly navigating a series of sloping ramps, jumping between them as they progress through the map. Smooth, sweeping motions with the mouse are necessary to avoid slipping off the ramps, with gaining momentum being the most important technique. Maps are separated into different difficulty tiers, with Tier 1 being the easiest.\nReception.\nLuke Plunkett of \"Kotaku\" called surfing a \"strange little quirk\" that dramatically changed the game, making it faster and more chaotic. Steven T. Wright of \"Eurogamer\" called the mode a \"fun palate-cleanser at the end of a long night of gaming\", though he found it difficult to learn at first. Emma Matthews of \"Rock Paper Shotgun\" also described surfing as \"fun\", noting the satisfaction of achieving a perfect run. She stated that it also helped players improve their \"Counter-Strike\" skills, such as being able to bunny hop better. Alice O'Connor of the same publication said that she loved watching surfing, expressing the regret that she was bad at it herself and wanting to learn. She called newer surf maps graphically \"amazing\". Gökhan Çakır of \"Dot Esports\" called surfing \"one of the more enjoyable casual experiences you’ll come across\" when playing \"Counter-Strike\", noting that it could also improve a player's jump timing.\nProfessional esports team Fnatic sponsored the creation of a surf map, \"surf_summer\", in 2017, with the appearance of a beach and boardwalk.\nLegacy.\nNathan Grayson of \"Kotaku\" compared the wall-riding movement techniques of \"Overwatch\" hero Lúcio to surfing in \"Counter-Strike\", noting that both required deceptive amounts of technique and constant momentum-based motion, and wondering if surf maps would be created for the game in a similar fashion."

        "title": "1922–23 Bowdoin Polar Bears men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1922–23 Bowdoin Polar Bears men's ice hockey season was the 4th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nBowdoin entered the year with several changes to the program. Aside from the normal roster turnover from graduation, Al Morrell, who was graduating after the fall term, stepped down as coach and turned the team over to Jack Magee. While Morrell was unlikely to play as his studies took priority, Harold Stonemetz was academically ineligible for at least the first half of the season and the team would have to rely even more heavily on untested additions. Practice began after Thanksgiving and was conducted in the gymnasium while the team waited for the Delta Rink to be rebuilt. Bowdoin got several weeks of practice in before the first game and appeared to have put together a stronger unit that years past. Young, centering Bucknam and Bowker, made up an entirely new offensive unit but, with how poor the team had fared over the past two seasons, that wasn't necessarily a bad thing. Miguel was moved out of the goal to defense while Nichols, who had played well in one game between the pipes, took over the Bowdoin crease.\nRenewed hopes were tested in the opening match against an independent aggregation from Lewiston and, at the start, everything looked good. Young opened the scoring early in the first period while Bowker doubled the lead at the start of the second. Lewiston fought back in the third and scored twice to tie the game. A 5-minute overtime was needed to settle the score and, unfortunately, the final goal came from a visitor. Despite the loss, the team had played well and there was belief that they could give Bates a fight when the Polar Bears started the state series. Miguel was back in goal for the game while Bowker moved back to defense and Needham took over at wing. The Garnet weren't impressed by Bowdoin or the lineup changes and hammered the home team 1–12. The visitors used a bevy of alternates in the match, allowing them to remain fresh through the contest, while Bowdoin's only substitute was Nichols. Widen caged the only goal for the Whites but that was an afterthought in the otherwise embarrassing defeat that saw the team outshot 6–47. With fears of a terrible season looming, Nichols returned to the crease while Miguel jumped up to take over at center. Bowker, Bucknam and Young rotated at wing while Al Morrell made a surprising appearance on defense. He brought his elder brother Malcolm with him and the two teamed with Widen to help lead Bowdoin to its first win on the season. In spite of poor ice, Bucknam gave Bowdoin an early lead with his second of the season. After the Mules tied the score, Morrell responded quickly with a score off the rush. Young replaced Bucknam in the third and promptly doubled the Bears' advantage. Colby was able to score late in the match but could not get the equalizer. Shortly before the game, the athletic council confirmed the appointment of Al Morrell as head coach of the team.\nAfter returning from the exam break, the Polar Bears changed their lineup once more. Al Morrell, now ineligible due to graduation, was replaced by Preble in the latter's first appearance of the season. Another returnee, Plaisted, assumed the starting job at center. Miguel returned to the crease while Nichols served as a reserve center while Cutter was added at wing. The new-look team faced an amateur club from Cabot Mills and eviscerated their opponents 14–2. After scoring 2 goals in the first, Plainsted was replaced by Nichols and the sometime-goaltender scored six consecutive goals in one of the most stunning performances ever seen from a Bowdoin skater. With the score so lopsided, coach Morrell was able to use three full contingent in the game and give many new players their first taste of game action. Cabot's two goals came in the final frame after the third team had hit the ice but that didn't affect the outcome. The next was a much closer affair when Bowdoin took on Maine at home. The two battled in a close match for two periods but the Polar Bears were able to pull away in the final period with 4 unanswered goals. the starting forwards Cutter, Plaisted and Bucknam each scored twice in the match.\nAs the season was soon to end, the team crammed as many games as they could into the last few weeks. After avenging their earlier loss to the Lewiston Independents, Bowdoin fell in the rematch with Colby. The loss was a result of overconfidence on the part of the Bears with the Mules taking several turnovers the length of the ice for scores in the final period. The loss made it nigh-impossible for Bowdoin to win the state championship as Bates would have to lose the three remaining games on their schedule to fall behind the Whites. The rematch with the Garnet, which was moved to Auburn for the Winter Carnival, was much closer than the first meeting between the two. Miguel and Plaisted teamed up on defense to keep the power Bates offense at bay while Widen switched off with Cronin at center. Even on the blueline, Plaisted found time to score the Bears' goal that tied the score. The teams seemed destined for overtime but two quick goals before the end of the third gave Bates the win. The disheartened team seemed lost at the start of the rematch with Maine. After finding themselves down by 3 after the first period, Bucknam sparked a comeback in the second and Bowdoin scored four times in the middle frame. The defense held in the third to give the Polar Bears a win and its first winning season.\nAlfred Stone served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1925–26 Bowdoin Polar Bears men's ice hockey season was the 7th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nIn the offseason, the team received some welcome news when Ben Houser signed a 3-year contract to remain with the college. While primarily a baseball coach, his success in the abbreviated '25 season showed that he wasn't bad at leading the ice hockey team. Additionally, the team had come in well under budget, costing $283.48 against a total funding of $482.50. The team held its first meeting immediately after the conclusion of the football season and tried to get a jump on the year. With the team returning six veterans, hopes were high for the Bears and they attempted to put together an ambitious schedule that included a 3-game swing through Massachusetts. Construction on the rink was nearly complete by the second week of December, thanks in part to an early winter, and floodlight were installed so that games could be played at night. As part of a new initiative by the school, students were required to participate in at least one sport to encourage physical fitness. While track and field was by far the most popular, with 193 participants, ice hockey came in second with 62 men working out on a daily basis. The popularity of the relatively new sport, despite all of the problems that had occurred over the past several seasons, was good news for the long-term future of the program.\nAfter the winter break, Bowdoin kicked off the year by heading to Lewiston. They first took on Bates and had the measure of the Bobcats all night. the Polar Bears more than doubled the Garnet in shots (36 to 17) and Berry didn't give an inch in goal. The offense came from all quarters: starting center (Cutter), defense (Cole) and reserve forward (Thayer) to give the Whites a total victory over a team that was typically the class of the state. The team stayed in town for a match against St. Dominique but the game devolved into an ugly affair for the Polar Bears. The team was widely outplayed and were swept off the ice 0–5. Jim Berry played a tremendous game in goal, stopping 45 shots in 45 minutes, an impressive feat under any circumstance. The Bears returned home for a match with Colby and got into a pitched battle with the Mules. The match started slow but soon the Bowdoin offense began attacking the opposing cage. Cutter scored twice to pace all players but the Colby netminder, Fagerstrom, was the star of the game. Fortunately, Berry played another strong game and allowed the Polar Bears to eke out a 3–2 victory.\nBowdoin travelled south the following week to take on Amherst, however, the games was cancelled due to bad weather. A couple of days later, Bowdoin took on Boston University for the second year in a row and had about a much success the second time around. The Bears were swept off the ice by the Terriers 0–6 and were unable to score despite attacking the BU goal throughout the game. The ice was choppy due to an earlier game between Harvard and Williams but Boston University didn't appear to have any difficulties in the match. Bowdoin returned to Maine afterwards to take on Bates in a rematch. Despite having to use mostly reserve players (Bucknam and Widen were the only regulars in the lineup) the Bears were able to pull out a narrow victory. Lord played an admirable game in goal to match the standard set by Berry. The win made Bowdoin a virtual lock for the state championship as only the rematch with Colby remained.\nBowdoin went into hibernation for the exam break and emerged with a match against MIT. The time off appeared to have softened the Bears' defense as they weren't able to sustain a strong effort over the course of the game. Bowdoin held an early lead but allowed two goals in both the second and third periods to let the game slip away from them. Berry played his weakest game of the season while Cutter led a valiant effort from the offense that fell short by 1 goal. The following day they travelled to face Colby and posted their best performance of the year. Despite poor ice, Bowdoin's offense was in high gear with Cutter netting a hat-trick. The Bears' defense was unassailable and notched its third shutout of the season to win both the game and the state championship.\nAfter the program won its second consecutive title, calls for better facilities began with a request for the school to build a rink that would not be as vulnerable to the weather as their current venue. At the time, Hebron Academy and St. Dominique had both built rinks for about $25,000, a considerable sum of money at the time, but Reggie Forsythe argued that the team and the sport had proven themselves to be worthy of investment.\nAubrey Fenderson served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1922–23 Colby Mules men's ice hockey season was the 2nd season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nThough not yet a minor sport, Colby's second season of varsity play began with Professor James Marsh assuming the coaching responsibilities. Unfortunately, the players were more familiar with the game than their bench boss so the team was left mostly to their own devices. Not that it mattered much since the team didn't have any available ice during the first month of the season on account of the weather. The team had received a small stipend from the school for operating costs but it was barely enough to cover the expense of setting up a temporary rink. The team was forced to foot the bill for equipment themselves but persevered through their difficulties.\nWhen the first game arrived, the team had been on the ice for just two practices and the results showed. Bates was able to take the game relatively easily. A week later the team played its first home game on the South End Arena and lost in a very close game to Bowdoin. With some experience under their belts, the team looked far better in the second game, despite the poor ice condition. McGowan and Huhn scored for the Mules on passed from Radcliffe but they were unable to overcome a pair of 2-goal leads from the Polar Bears.\nThe team got a few weeks off afterwards and didn't play again until the exam break. The reprieve allowed the team to recollect itself and get some practice time in which mightily improved their chances. They were also aided by the appearance of Grenville Vale, who had captained the team last season. Millett gave up his spot on the starting lineup while Huhn dropped back to defense. Vale was one of four players to score in the game and help push Colby to its first win on the season. The win kept the team's hopes for a championship alive but they would need a repeat performance when they travelled to Orono for the rematch a week later. Unfortunately, Maine got its revenge at home and Colby's title chances were next to nothing. The team played a fast game against the Black Bears but they were hampered by too few penalties on what they believed were infractions by Maine.\nColby got a 12-day break afterwards and returned for the final week of the season with a rematch against the Polar Bears. The game started well in Bowdoin's favor with the puck staying in Colby's end for almost the entire first period. Finding itself down by a pair at the start of the second, Vale led a charge with a hat-trick in the middle frame that ended with the Mules scoring the final six goals for a stunning victory. The final game came a week later with a home stand against Bates. While Colby couldn't win the title, they could pull even and spoil the Garnet's pursuit of the state championship at the same time. However, Bates was unbothered by the Mules and swatted the Blues aside with relative ease. Vale got the only goal for Colby in an otherwise terrible effort that ended their season on a low note.\nAthletic Director C. Harry Edwards served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "2024 Major League Baseball season",
        "text": "The 2024 Major League Baseball season (MLB) is an ongoing professional baseball season in the United States and Canada. The season began on March 20–21 with a two-game series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Diego Padres held in Seoul, South Korea, before the regular season proper runs from March 28 to September 29. The 94th All-Star Game is planned for July 16 at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas. The postseason is then scheduled to begin on October 1 with a potential World Series Game 7 set for November 2. Going into the season, the defending World Series champions are the Texas Rangers from the 2023 season. During the offseason, the Oakland Athletics were approved by MLB owners to relocate to Las Vegas in 2028. It will also be the team's final season in Oakland as they will leave the Oakland Coliseum to temporarily play at the Sutter Health Park in West Sacramento for three years.\nSchedule.\nOn July 13, 2023, Major League Baseball released its 2024 schedule. There are 162 games scheduled for all teams. As has been the case since 2023, each team will play 13 games against their division rivals, totaling 52 games. Each team will play six games against six opponents and seven games against four opponents in the same league for a total of 64 games. Each team will also play 46 interleague games, including a four-game home-and-home series against their designated interleague rival.\nAs part of the MLB World Tour, the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Diego Padres opened the season at Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul on March 20–21, in the first-ever MLB regular season games played in South Korea. Opening Day in North America occurred on March 28, with all but four clubs in action with the Milwaukee Brewers, New York Mets, Atlanta Braves, and Philadelphia Phillies opening on March 29 because of a postponement due to inclement weather. Other MLB World Tour series include the Houston Astros and the Colorado Rockies at Estadio Alfredo Harp Helú in Mexico City on April 27–28, the New York Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies at London Stadium in London on June 8–9, and the Boston Red Sox and the Tampa Bay Rays in spring training at Estadio Quisqueya in Santo Domingo on March 9–10.\nThe San Francisco Giants and St. Louis Cardinals are scheduled to play at Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Alabama, on June 20, in a game honoring the Negro leagues and hall of fame outfielder Willie Mays. The 94th All-Star Game is planned for July 16, hosted by the Texas Rangers at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas. The MLB Little League Classic at Bowman Field in Williamsport, Pennsylvania is scheduled for August 18 with the New York Yankees taking on the Detroit Tigers.\nRule changes.\nOn December 21, 2023, MLB announced a set of rule changes that will take effect in 2024.\nSpring training.\nSpring training for the 2024 season began in late February and lasted through March. Teams began workouts and practice for spring training beginning in mid-February. Pitchers and catchers reported first, followed by position players a few days later.\nPrior to the start of the regular season, each team played between 27 and 34 spring training games (with the exception of the San Diego Padres and Los Angeles Dodgers, who played a shortened spring training of 21 and 22 games respectively, due to their regular season games in Seoul), beginning on February 22. There were several times during spring training where a team had two different squads playing different teams simultaneously. In addition to spring training games, teams occasionally played exhibition games with non-MLB teams, such as Minor League Baseball teams, independent teams, or college teams. These exhibition games are not counted in spring training standings. Spring training ended on March 26, two days before the Opening Day.\nDuring spring training in 2024, MLB launched a new initiative called MLB Spring Breakout. Each organization puts together a team of their best prospects to compete against another organization's prospects from March 14 to March 17.\nUniforms.\nUniform advertisements.\nThis is the second year where teams added advertisement patches to their uniforms. The following teams have announced their uniform advertisements. \nCity Connect.\nEight additional teams will unveil new City Connect uniforms and wear them for the first time during the season. Additionally, the Los Angeles Dodgers will unveil a new City Connect this year, becoming the first team to change their City Connect uniform since the program's inception.\nVenues.\nThe Oakland Athletics lease with the Oakland Coliseum expires after the end of the season. On June 15, 2023, the team officially announced they would begin the relocation process to Las Vegas. The move was approved by the other MLB owners on November 16. The Athletics would move into a new 33,000-seat fixed roof ballpark by the 2028 season. On April 4, 2024, the Athletics announced they would play at Sutter Health Park in Sacramento, California for the next three seasons with an option for 2028 before moving to Las Vegas, making this their final season in Oakland.\nBroadcast rights.\nTelevision.\nNational.\nThis is the third year of the existing seven-year deals with ESPN, Fox, TBS, Apple TV+, and MLB Network.\nPostseason.\nDuring the postseason, the ESPN networks, including ABC (with Spanish–language simulcasts on ESPN Deportes) will air all four Wild Card Series. TBS (with Spanish-language simulcasts on MLB Network) will then broadcast the American League Division Series and the American League Championship Series, and Fox Sports (Fox and FS1, with Spanish-language simulcasts on Fox Deportes) will broadcast the National League Division Series, the National League Championship Series, and the World Series.\nLocal.\nAT&amp;T SportsNet closure.\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) wound down its AT&amp;T SportsNet regional sports network (RSN) business prior to the start of the 2024 season. The move affected the Colorado Rockies on AT&amp;T SportsNet Rocky Mountain, the Houston Astros on AT&amp;T SportsNet Southwest, and the Pittsburgh Pirates on AT&amp;T SportsNet Pittsburgh.\nThe Astros and the NBA's Houston Rockets took over AT&amp;T SportsNet Southwest and rebranded it to the Space City Home Network after the end of the Astros' regular season on October 3, 2023. Fenway Sports Group, owners of the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Red Sox, took over AT&amp;T SportsNet Pittsburgh, rebranding it to just SportsNet Pittsburgh on October 2, 2023. On December 13, 2023, the Pirates announced they would jointly own SportsNet Pittsburgh beginning on January 1, 2024. NESN, through Fenway Sports Group, will operate the network. In February, MLB Local Media took over production of Rockies games.\nWBD had owned a 29% share of Root Sports Northwest, the Mariners' RSN, through the end of the 2023 season, and had produced Mariners telecasts. The Mariners took full control of the network on January 1, 2024.\nDiamond Sports bankruptcy.\nThis would be the second season affected by the February 2023 bankruptcy of Diamond Sports Group, owners of the Bally Sports regional sports networks. Diamond Sports Group may cut ties with additional teams it previously had deals with. The rights of those teams that Major League Baseball took over from Diamond midway through the 2023 season, the Arizona Diamondbacks and the San Diego Padres, could also change in 2024. Diamond's deal with the Minnesota Twins also expired before the season.\nOn February 2, 2024, Diamond Sports announced agreements with the Rangers, Guardians and Twins that will result in a decreased rights fee and will end their contracts with Diamond after the 2024 season.\nRetirements.\nThe following players and coaches retired during the 2024 season and before the start of the 2025 campaign:"

        "text": "The Beloit team was a minor league baseball team based in Beloit, Kansas. Beloit was without a formal nickname, common in the era, as the franchise played the 1909 and 1910 seasons as members of the Class D level Central Kansas League. Beloit hosted minor league home games at the Association Park.\nBeloit was home to the semi-professional \"Beloit Leaguers\" team from 1919 to 1922. In 1920, the Leaguers notably hosted five games against the visiting Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro National League.\nHistory.\nThe 1909 Beloit team was the first hosted minor league baseball team in Beloit, Kansas, beginning play as members of the 1909 Class D level Central Kansas League. The league expanded from six teams to eight teams in 1909, adding the Abilene and Beloit teams. The Abilene Red Sox, Clay Center Cubs, Ellsworth Blues, Junction City Soldiers, Manhattan Maroons, Minneapolis Minnies and Salina Trade Winners teams joined Beloit in beginning league play on June 14, 1909.\nIn their first season of play, Beloit placed sixth in the eight-team Central Kansas League. Beloit ended the 1909 season with a record of 33–36, as Hi Ebright served as manager. Beloit finished 12.0 games behind the first place Ellsworth Blues in the final league standings, as no playoffs were held. The final standings were led by Ellsworth (44–23), followed by the Salina Trade Winners (40–28), Abilene Red Sox (37–30), Minneapolis Minnies (36–32), Junction City Soldiers (34–32), Beloit (33–36), Clay Center Colts (32–37) and Manhattan Maroons (16–54).\nIn their final season of minor league play, Beloit relocated during the 1910 season. Continuing play in the 1910 Central Kansas League, Beloit had a record of 11–40 on July 21, 1910, when the team relocated to Chapman, Kansas. After compiling a 7–22 record in Chapman, the team finished the season in last place. Beloit/Chapman ended the regular season with an overall record 18–62, to place eighth, playing the season under manager Ben Dimond in both locations. The dual city team finished 34.5 games behind the first place Ellsworth Blues in the eight-team league final standings. Chapman permanently folded following the 1910 season, as the Central Kansas League was reduced to four teams in 1911.\nBeloit, Kansas has not hosted another minor league team.\nBeloit Leaguers 1919 to 1922.\nFrom 1919 to 1922, Beloit hosted a baseball team called the \"Beloit Leaguers,\" an independent semi-professional team, who were not part of any organized league. The team was founded in 1919 by local businessman Ike Sowell, who formed a local Baseball Association that built a new ballpark for the team, named Sowell Park.\nOn April 22 and 23, 1920, the Leaguers hosted the Negro National League team Kansas City Monarchs for two games. In the first game, Kansas City defeated Beloit 3–2 in 10-innings on a home run by Hurley McNair. In the second game, Beloit defeated Kansas City 5–4. On May 4–5 and 6, the teams met again for three games in Beloit, playing at \"Osborne\" and \"Sowell Park\". Beloit swept all three games, by scores of 6–3, 3-1 and 2–0. Beloit defeated Monarchs pitcher John Donalsdon in the second game.\nThe 1920 team claimed the \"independent state championship of Kansas.\" Besides the Kansas City Monarchs, the Leaguers also played numerous games against the Kansas City Blues and Omaha Rourkes minor league teams.\nThe ballpark.\nThe 1909 and 1910 Beloit teams hosted minor league home games at the Association Park. The ballpark had general admission of 0.25 and 0.35 for the grandstand. Admission was 0.50 on July 4."

Paddlers start in the reverse order of their heats position in the semifinal and complete a single run, with the top 10 advancing to the final. The start list for the final is once again in reverse order of the semifinal results. The athlete with the best time in the single-run final is awarded gold.\nA penalty of 2 seconds is awarded for touching a gate and a 50-second penalty is awarded for missing a gate or negotiating it in the opposite direction.\nAn easier gate setup is generally used for the heats and then a more difficult one for semifinal and final.\nResults.\nPenalties are included in the time shown.

        "text": "The 1929–30 Williams Ephs men's ice hockey season was the 27th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nBefore the start to the season, the team learned that it would be losing its head coach for the past three years. Leo Bellerose, who was also at the helm of the lacrosse program, was busy putting together a thesis for his master's degree from the Sorbonne and did not have the free time required to coach either team. For a replacement, the school turned to Princeton alum Alexander Sayles who had spent the past four years coaching high school hockey at Phillips Academy and Pomfret School. At the same time as they announced the new head coach, the school also was mulling over building an indoor ice rink for the program while planning for two temporary rinks to be available for this year.\nPractice began in early December, despite Sayles being unable to attend for the first two weeks, and were conducted under the direction of team captain Franklin Hoyt. While the team had a mix of veterans and new players, the biggest concern for the Ephs was in goal. With the graduation of Watters, the team had no candidates who had played varsity hockey before. Hamilton and Lessing had shared the net for the freshman team so there was some experience but the team would have to hope that at least one of them could assume the responsibilities. Once Sayles arrived he found the team in dire need of ice time as the winter was, once again unaccommodatingly warm. The team had little chance to work together prior to the winter break and made arrangements with Princeton to use the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink for a few days before the team took on the Tigers in an exhibition game. The lack of proper training led to a rather poor showing by the team as they lost 3–7 but the Ephs grew stronger as the game went along.\nWilliams had about two weeks to get ready for their first official game and looked superior to Army in their opening tilt. However, the Ephs were unable to take advantage of many an opportunity and could only manage a tie in the game. Williams was supposed to return for their home opener against MIT on the 15th, however, the same warm weather that prevented them from practicing caused the match to be cancelled. Instead, the team headed out of town for their first contest with Amherst. The warm weather had rendered the Lord Jeffs' rink a quagmire so the two were forced to play on the Mass Aggies' venue. The game had a similar feeling to the Army match and saw Williams twice overcome deficits to force overtime. The attack from Langmaid, Hoyt and Gross was key in keeping Amherst on the defensive for much of the game and continued in the extra session. The Amherst cage was under siege all night with the Ephs firing 46 shots on goal to just 14 from the Sabrinas. The constant pressure finally resulted in Langmaid's second goal of the match at the 7:30 mark of overtime and the first win for Williams. By then, the weather had cooled off enough for the Ephs to play at home and they played Middlebury mostly even for 40 minutes. The Panthers brought a physical game with them and tried to batter the Ephs into submission but the Purple held served and answered both Middlebury scored in the first period. After a scoreless second, the Blue defenders faltered and 4 goals from Williams put the game out of reach.\nAs they had the year before, Williams took a road swing south and played Princeton and Penn. Coincidentally, the results were nearly the same as well with a loss to the Tigers following a win over the Quakers. Hazzard, who was the team's most consistent defenseman, was unavailable and his absence was felt as the Ephs surrendered 9 goals in the two games. The team then returned home for its final two home games of the year and played a listless game against Amherst. The Sabrinas were able to avenge their earlier loss against a seemingly uninterested Purple squad. The loss, however, seemed to light a fire under the Ephs and they roared back the following night for a victory over Massachusetts Agricultural. Hazzard's first two goals of the season proved to be the difference for Williams.\nDue to the lack of practice for the team, they decided to arrange an exhibition match with Albany High School that they hoped would set them up for success as they closed out the season. While they won the match, the score was very close and, if anything, demonstrated that the team had regressed due to their lack of ice time. After cancelling a match with Union, the team ended the year with a trip east and ended up losing both matches. The first, versus Boston University, turned into a debacle for the Ephs as they allowed a season-worst 8 goals. Both Ward and Lessing played in the game but neither was capable of handling the Terriers' assault. The start of their final game was more promising as they held Brown scoreless for the first 19 minutes but the Brunos provided an unrelenting barrage of shots that sunk the Ephs. Lessing made 42 saves in a heroic effort but the Bears didn't give Williams much in the way of chances an their season ended with a 1–4 loss.\nEdward Reeves served as team manager with Sterling Hiles as his assistant.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1920–21 Bowdoin Polar Bears men's ice hockey season was the 2nd season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nDue to on-campus improvements, particularly on the stretch of land where the team's rink had been the previous year, The school made plans to build a new rink on the nearby river delta. Quite literally, the biggest change that resulted from this was the larger skating surface that would result. The new rink would measure 180' by 90' and, though it was still smaller than a standard rink size, it was more than double the area that the Hyde Hall Rink had provided. The team put together a schedule of 8 games, however, warm weather caused the match on January 6 to be cancelled. The weather did not cool off over the next week so the team's first official contest against Tufts had to be played on the Portland Country Club Rink. The rainy conditions led to a 0–0 final score as both squads could hardly move the puck from puddle to puddle in only 30 minutes of game time.\nConditions were better for the next game but the result was worse. In spite of the addition of Stonemetz and Palmer to the lineup, the later of which scored the first goal of the season for Bowdoin, the Polar Bears lost 1–4. The team's first game on the Delta Rink ended without a single Bowdoin goal and they lost to rival Bates 0–4. During the exam break, Portland C.C. came to the Delta for a rematch but the time off didn't appear to help Bowdoin as they allowed 8 goals to their opponents. Morrell's move to wing helped spark the offense but caused the defense to turn into a sieve.\nWarm weather forced the cancellation of several more games and Bowdoin wasn't able to get back on the ice until the 19th. This time, however, they were able to skate away in triumph after defeating the Association of St. Dominiques. The next two games came in short order and, with Morrell back on defense, the team was unable to score. Bowdoin managed just one goal in the two games and ended the season on a sour note.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\nScoring statistics.\n&lt;br&gt;"

It is the 29th season of pan-European professional club rugby competition.\nThis is the second time the tournament features the top teams from South Africa, following the second United Rugby Championship season. \nThe final will be played at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London, England. La Rochelle were the defending champions, having won their second European Cup title in the previous edition. but were eliminated in the quarter final by their runners-up on both occasions, Leinster\nTeams.\nTwenty-four clubs from the three major European domestic and regional leagues qualified to compete in the 2023–24 edition of the Champions Cup.\nThe distribution of teams is:\nTeam details.\nBelow is the list of coaches, captain and stadiums with their method of qualification for each team.\nPool stage.\nTeams are awarded four points for a win, two for a draw, one bonus point for scoring four tries in a game, and one bonus point for losing by less than eight points.\nThe draw for the pool stage took place on 21 June 2023. Unlike the previous season, the format consisted of four pools with six teams in each. The rules of the draw stipulated that the 2022–23 champions of the three European domestic leagues (Saracens, Toulouse and Munster) and the 2022–23 Champions Cup winners (La Rochelle) would each be drawn into separate pools. The remaining 20 teams were then drawn at random, with the only condition being that no more than two teams from the same domestic league could be placed into each pool.\nKnockout stage.\nThe knockout stage will begin with the round of 16, starting on 5 April 2024, and concludes with the final on 25 May 2024.\nLike in 2022/23 the round of 16 will consist of a single leg match, consisting of the top four ranked teams from each Pool respectively. All clubs will thereafter be ranked in descending order based firstly on their ranking in their pool and subsequently on the number of match points they have accumulated, to create an overall ranking from 1 to 16. The pool winners will be ranked 1 to 4, the second-placed clubs will be ranked 5 to 8, the third-placed clubs will be ranked 9 to 12, and the fourth-placed clubs will be ranked 13 to 16.\nWhilst the round of 16 follows a pre-determined format, the quarter-finals will see home advantage given to the higher ranked team based on a pre-determined match-up. The semi-finals are to be played at a neutral venue, with the higher ranked team having home country advantage."

        "title": "1923–24 Williams Ephs men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1923–24 Williams Ephs men's ice hockey season was the 21st season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nDespite a successful season the year before, Williams had to replace the hockey team's coach with Ralph Cordingly. The team assembled in early December though, without any available ice, the candidates were forced to use the gymnasium for the tryouts. As the team was gearing up for their rapid-fire schedule at the end of December, some of the players attempted to get ice time on an individual basis at the rinks around Boston and New York but the first time the team would appear on the ice would be the opening match on Boxing Day.\nFrom December 26 through January 1, the Williams ice hockey team played one game a day and came away with a surprisingly strong record. The first four-game took place at Lake Placid In the opening match against Dartmouth, neither team had been able to get much practice in ahead of time and the game was considerably slowed when the surface cracked and allowed water to seep up from below. Poor ice continued in the next two matches with Amherts, the first of which was also held in blizzard conditions. The teams played about as well as could be expected but after two overtimes and no goals to show for their efforts, the first match was called a draw. Williams finally got its first goals of the season in its third match and rode a second consecutive shutout from Lowes to its first win on the year. Despite playing so many games in such a short time, the Ephs looked better as their trip went along. Nowhere was this fact more evident than the match against Yale; the Bulldogs had been playing together since mid-November and were one of the best teams in the nation but were still only able to get a single goal past Lowes. While the offense wasn't able to conjure up a goal, the play of the team in the game demonstrated just how good the team could be if they had adequate facilities.\nThe team took an overnight train to Buffalo for a match on New Year's Eve but found that the rink they were to use had been made unusable due to a thaw. Frank Baird helped the team quickly gain the use of a rink at Port Colborne, about 25 miles away from Buffalo, and hastily played a game against a local aggregation. Though informal, it was the first game outside the United States in the history of the program. The following night the team played its scheduled game against the Nichols Club, a team made mostly of former college players. The defense remained a formidable asset for the team and helped them to their second win of the year.\nWilliams returned home after their hectic opening to the season and found that the weather had not been kind. The rink on Weston Field was still out of sorts and the team had to practice on Leake's Pond. They were able to eventually get some time in on the artificial rink but only briefly. The team was supposed to kick off its home slate with a game against Middlebury on January 12, however, that game was cancelled due to poor ice conditions. The first home game didn't come until the following week when YMCA College came to town, however, the layoff had not the team any favors. For the fourth time in six games, Williams was held without a goal and the Ephs wasted an outstanding performance from their goaltender. Soft, slushy ice and a late rain limited the game to just 30 minutes and slowing the players down but it was the defensive efforts of the visitors that prevented any Eph from finding the twine. Just 15 shots were attempted by the two teams combined but it was enough to hand Williams another loss. With the poor ice refusing to clear up, a match with Bates was postponed until the 22nd. When it finally was held, the team looked completely disorganized and fell 1–4. On an individual basis, the Purple players appeared to be better than their northern counterparts, however, the severe lack of practice left them playing as solitary figures rather than a team. Superior teamwork, particularly with regards to passing, led to the team's downfall. Captain Stephenson was moved back to defense in place of Pressprich while Popham assumed the role at left wing but that change didn't provide any tangible benefit. Stephenson's first goal of the season was the only marker Williams could manage and the team was forced back to the drawing board.\nThe exam break put the team on the sidelines for two weeks when what it really needed was practice, but that move was unavoidable. When the team did finally resume the season, they welcomed Amherst for the Ephs' final home match on the year. In the interim the team had been able to address some of their issues and coach Cordingly had inserted Pressprich at left wing. Both squads were evenly matched throughout the game but the Lord Jeffs held a narrow lead in the third and were trying to squeeze out a close win. Pressprich scored with just 2 minutes remaining to ruin those plans and forced the old foes into an overtime battle. The first two 5-minute periods ended with no additional goals so a second pair of overtimes was agreed upon. Tired out by the pace of the game, the Ephs' defense allowed two goals in the third and fourth overtimes and handed bragging rights, at least temporarily, to Amherst. The rematch happened a week later at Amherst with a freshman, Russ, being inserted at right wing while Stephenson and Pressprich were returned to their former position. Unfortunately, the team was still unable to get its offense going and was blanked yet again.\nWilliams travelled down to Connecticut for their second game of the year against Yale and were completely overwhelmed by the nation-leading Elis. Having learned from their previous game, the Bulldogs didn't take the Ephs lightly and assailed the Purple cage all game. Yale outshot Williams 18–64 using a bevy of substitutes in the game to keep their players fresh. In spite of the result, Williams played its best game in over a month and Lowes was hailed for his performance in goal as the score would have been much worse than 0–5 without him. The experience gained in recent weeks ended up paid dividends as the Ephs were finally able to get their offense going against the Mass Aggies. Stephenson had one of the most outstanding individual performances by scoring all 5 goals for his team but the credit for each marker needed to be shared with the rest of the team as each goal came as a result of a pass from behind the Aggies' goal.\nA miscommunication between Williams and Army caused the next game to be played as an exhibition match. The managers for Williams had assumed the game would take place in the afternoon, as normal. With that in mind, Lowes made arrangements to arrive in West Point around noon. Army, however, had scheduled the match to take place at 10:30 A.M. and the contest would have been over by the time he arrived. Feeling that it would be unfair to ask Williams to play without its regular goal guard, Army offered not only to loan the Ephs their backup netminder but to also not count the game as an official match. The following day the team win in Morristown, New Jersey taking on a contingent of country club players. With Lowes in goal the Ephs easily defeated the golfers and then returned home to practice for their final matches of the year.\nThe Ephs headed out at the end of February to take on the Albany Country Club but the game was cancelled due to poor ice conditions. The following day the team met Hamilton and fought to a draw. Hamilton, having won 8 of their 10 games, was expected to win the match with relative ease but the Ephs were far better than their record would indicate. With a good ice surface, the Williams contingent was able to demonstrate just how fast it was and routinely broke away for rushes towards the Continental goal. Stephenson, Pressprich and Lowes were each playing their final college games and were vital in keeping Hamilton from scoring. Chase and Watkins provided the two Williams goals while the two teams went scoreless in overtime and ended with a respectable, if unsatisfying, end to their seasons.\nBenjamin Fawcett served as team manager with Frank Gummey as his assistant.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "1926–27 Williams Ephs men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1926–27 Williams Ephs men's ice hockey season was the 24th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAs the team began to meet in late-November, the Ephs new they had several challenges to overcome if they wanted to get anywhere close to the success they had seen in '26. First, the team was now led by Leo Bellerose, a professor of the French language who was recently hired by the college. With its 4th head coach in the past 5 seasons, the players would have to adapt to a new style once more. The lineup, however, provided a bigger test as four of the team's starters had now graduated. Replacing those major pieces would be slightly easier than normal as many of the prospective athletes had gotten ice time last season. The toughest obstacle was the same as it always had been for Williams: the weather. A late winter left the team without any usable ice when they started training and the team was forced into the college gymnasium. The temperature dropped low enough in December and the team used Leake's Pond as their practice facility once the surface froze to a satisfactory degree.\nAfter three days of practice at the Springfield Arena, Williams arrived in Lake Placid on 26 December. The team had a difficult time adjusting to the larger skating surfaces and went through several more days of intense practice as they got themselves ready for the 4-game series with Dartmouth. The Ephs were facing their old bench boss, J. Philip Bower, and the Indians' coach knew many of the Purple players. That didn't stop Williams from giving the Green a tough test as the two fought through three close games. Dartmouth won the first three matches, greatly buoyed by the strength of All-American Myles Lane, but Williams was able to get better as their ice time increased as the Ephs were able to pull out a win in the final contest.\nThe team was able to get a short rest in before their next game and Williams had seemingly no difficulty from Rensselaer. Despite playing on a far smaller surface than they had at Lake Placid, the Ephs poured 8 goals into the RPI cage. A hat-trick from Howe paced all players while the forward unit of Brigham, Blaney and Smith accounted for the other five. Other than playing at home, there was little change in the next game as Williams was once more led by three goals from a defenseman. This time it was Austin's chance to shine and he led the team to a fairly easy win over YMCA College. The following game gave Williams an unexpected challenge as the team found itself down 0–2 in the second. Though a steady snowfall slowed the pace of play, Union didn't seem to mind and got out to an early lead. Once the precipitation began to peter out, the Ephs charged back to tie the game. The Dutchmen regained the lead at the start of the third but Williams kept attacking and were able to score twice before the end of regulation to escape with a win.\nWarm weather hit the region afterwards and kept the team off of the ice. Not only were several games cancelled but the Ephs weren't able to practice and keep us their strengths. The next game for Williams didn't happen until early February and, by the time the faced off against Amherst, the ice on the Sage Hall Rink was soft but usable. The game was a slog and played mostly in the Lord Jeffs' end but the Ephs were unable to capitalize. A poor defensive play at the start of the second allowed Amherst to score the only goal of the game and drew the ire of the assembled crowd. The next night, Williams was in Ithaca and was again the better team on the ice. The goal guard for Cornell was the only thing standing in the way of the Ephs taking a sizable lead and the score sat tied at 2-all after regulation. Early in the game, Hutchins received a minor penalty for freezing the puck (illegal at the time) and was sent off the ice. Austin and Blaney subbed in goal while the rest of the team just skated the puck around the ice to prevent any shots from getting on goal. The game was also memorable for being played as four 15-minute quarters. In the first of the two 5-minute overtimes the teams went scoreless. Blaney made sure there was no repeat in the second when he socred twice to complete his hat-trick and win the game for the Ephs. One day on, the team was taking on Syracuse and soundly defeated the hapless Orangemen. While Williams was likely the better of the two, Syracuse was missing several players and had difficulty mustering any kind of challenge for the Ephs. Soft ice was the only thing that held the Purple back but even so, Austin's secon hat-trick of the season was more than enough to secure a victory.\nThe next game for the team saw the Ephs renew their annual meeting with Yale. Williams was a match for the Elis in the early part of the game, scoring first and then later tying the score at 2-all. 1,800 watched as the teams fought on sticky ice in a humid building that seemed to drag the Purple down as the game wore on. The game was even at about the halfway point but Yale, employing a bevy of alternates, was able to outlast Williams and scored the final five goals to win in convincing fashion. Afterwards, several more games were cancelled, including the rematch with Amherst, all due to a lack of ice in the region. The warm weather also, again, kept the team from being able to practice so that, by the time they headed down to New Jersey to take on Princeton, the team was in no shape to win. Predictably, the team was thumped by the Tigers, losing 3–9. Blaney was one of the few bright sports for the team as he scored twice but that did little to help the team avoid defeat. Captain Leonard Smith was unavailable for the game, however, his younger brother Darwin stepped in at Left Wing.\nBerkley Hotchkiss served as team manager with William Eaton as his assistant.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1921–22 Williams Ephs men's ice hockey season was the 19th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAfter a very successful season in '21, Williams came into the year with high hopes. With most of the team returning, the Ephs had a good foundation for success. With only defenseman Dudley Irwin departing due to graduation, the team that had nearly gone undefeated was hoping for even better results. While the faces weren't very different, the team would have to adjust to the new style as Williams had joined with most other college programs and formally dropped the rover position. They had played five of their six games the year before with a 7-man team but the rising trend in the sport was irresistible and the Ephs would play 6-man hockey forevermore. While that alteration to the team would have an unknown affect on their season, the change in temperature was far more predictable. After having to deal with a lack of ice all year, the team welcomed an early chill and managed to get some outdoor practice on Leake's Pond while they waited for the Cole Field House Rink to be ready. Williams scheduled eight games at the start with the possibility of adding another before season's end. As the players were getting ready to head home for the winter break, however, the weather warmed up and forced the off the ice.\nWilliams returned after the Christmas holiday and got to work for their opening match with Rensselaer. Luckily, the temperature had dropped in the interim and the game was able to take place on the Cole Field House Rink. The ice was not in the best condition, being a bit soft and overused from practice, but that didn't stop the Ephs from trouncing the Engineers 9–1. Team captain Becket, who had dropped back to defense to fill in for the departed Dudley Irwin, led the way with 4 goals. Four of his teammates joining in on the fun while several alternates were used throughout the game. A week later the team had a near-repeat performance when they stomped on YMCA College. Despite a slow start, the entire starting lineup got into the scoring action with only Wallace Richmond, the goaltender, failing to score a goal.\nWhile Williams was riding high after two dominate performances, their schedule put them on the sidelines for two and half weeks. Unfortunately, during that break, the team lost the services of Richmond to an illness and would need a new netminder. Another more common problem also cropped up when the weather warmed and two games had to be cancelled. The match with the Albany Country Club was completely scrapped while the contest against Amherst was postponed. When the Ephs were finally able to hold the match a week late, the team was visibly weaker than they had been in January. Lowes, who took over in Richmond's absence, played a strong game in goal but regular center William Stephenson had injured a tendon in his leg and was unable to play. His younger brother, John, subbed in but the offense wasn't quite the same.\nWilliams travelled to Amherst for the rematch and to kick off a road trip that went badly for the Purple. Amherst was able exact revenge from the Ephs with a close victory, handing Williams its first loss of the season. The next night the team was in Connecticut facing Yale and were unable to manage a single goal. Despite the elder Stephenson's return to the lineup, the Bulldog defense was just to strong for Williams to overcome. The superior teamwork and depth left the Ephs in the dust and ended any pretentions the team may have had for the season. The team recovered slightly on their swing west to play Army with a tie, but the Ephs were still hamstring by injury and illness.\nWarm weather reared its ugly head once more and forced the next game to be played on Leake's Pond. Nickle, the opposing goaltender was continually penalized for kneeling in the crease, a violation of the then-rule that goaltenders were required to stay on the skates. His illegal ploy worked, however, and he stopped several otherwise sure goals from Purple sticks. Lowes, meanwhile, played a good game but surrendered a pair to drop the team down to .500. The final game came a week later when the team traveled to New York City to take on Columbia. Williams started off in good order, jumping out to a 3–1 lead after the first. Unfortunately, the team flagged in the later portion of the game and allowed 4 unanswered goals to the Lions to lose their last game of the season.\nDonald Cruse served as team manager with Alfred C. Mosher as his assistant.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "1922–23 Williams Ephs men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1922–23 Williams Ephs men's ice hockey season was the 20th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nFor its 20th year of varsity ice hockey, Williams College finally hired a head coach for the program. Russell Barkell, a star player for Michigan during its club years, arrived after New Year's to take over. While the team had already been working out under the direction of team captain William Stephenson, it was when Barkell arrived that the real work began. The new bench boss took group of 20 prospective players and tried to craft a team out of equal parts veterans and rookies. Fortunately, cold weather made ice available for the team and they put in several intense sessions before the first game against Rensselaer. While the team was practicing, the school made the decision to construct a temporary rink on Weston Field, the football venue. This was done in part to try and address the problems with poor ice that had plagued the Ephs over the past several years.\nConditions for their first game were ideal and the Ephs displayed a far superior brand of hockey to the Engineers. While the score was a modest 3–0 margin, Lowes had to face just a single shot on goal all game thanks to the stifling defense from the brothers Stephenson. Due to poor ice conditions, the next game was moved to Pittsfield, Massachusetts. On game day, the temperature dipped below zero for the battle with the Mass Aggies. The defense played a strong game, limiting a fast Aggie group to just 2 goals but the offense could not take advantage despite three extra periods. Part of the reason was the bitter cold that saw the game slow down in the later stages and caused a bit of frostbite on some of the players' ears.\nThe third game of the year pitted Williams against one of the top teams in the nation, Dartmouth. The Ephs' offense looked much better against the Greens and skated well in the first period. Two Purple goals were scored in the opening minutes before the Indians realized they had a fight on their hands and started matching the level of play. Dartmouth cut into the led before the end of the first but Williams retained a 3–1 lead. The Ephs increased their margin in the second with two more goals to take a huge lead but there was still plenty of time left. After the fifth Williams marker, the sleeping giant awoke and began peppering the Purple cage with Shots. In just over a period of play, the Indians scored goals to tie the match and force overtime. Two 5-minute periods went by without another goal and a third, sudden death period was called for. It took 8 minutes for the winning goal to be scored but, unfortunately, it came from the stick of the Dartmouth captain and completed the astounding comeback.\nThe team had a long layoff afterwards and didn't hit the ice for over two weeks. Upon their return, the Purple club looked sluggish against their old rivals, Amherst. Williams was outplayed in the first two periods and entered the third down by a pair. After the Stephenson brothers were moved up to the forward line in the third, the team began to show signs of life. William scored to cut the lead in half but the resurgence came too late and the Ephs lost the match. A week later, Williams avenged the loss by dominating the Lord Jeffs on their home rink 5–0. The addition of three freshmen to the lineup, Watkins, Howe and Popham, led the team to a stark reversal even amidst a winter storm. Pressprich and Howe proved to be an invaluable combination on the blueline that seemingly stopped every Amherst rush before it neared Lowes.\nThe team continued its inspired play when it met Army a few days later and scored another 5 goals. Williams was visibly the better team, skating and passing with better efficacy than the Cadets. The Purple kept rolling on the road and trounced the Albany Country Club 7–0. While the game wasn't as bad as the score would indicate, the superiority of Williams' netminder caused the sizable discrepancy. After the game, the team received news that their upcoming game against Columbia was cancelled. The Lions had apparently used several players who were not eligible to participate in earlier games and, once the university found out, the remainder of the season was terminated. Fortunately, Hamilton was willing to step in a replacement opponent.\nAt the end of February, Williams played its final home game and posted their second consecutive shutout. RPI had arrived for a rematch but the Ephs were still too much for the Engineers and the new-look Purple easily defeated Rensselaer despite a lack of teamwork. The Stephenson brothers combined for 5 goals on the night with William recording a hat-trick. The very hot Ephs then travelled south to face their toughest opponent on the season in Princeton. The Tigers proved to be the better team in the first two periods, opening a 5-goal lead on Williams. The ice at the new Hobey Baker Memorial Rink was sticky due to the humidity in the building and slowed the players down. Lowes, meanwhile, was unable to drop to his knees to stop the puck under the rules outlined by the United States Hockey Association, under which Princeton played. The Purple acclimated to the style by the third and scored twice but it wasn't enough to overcome the large deficit. Soft ice marred the final game of the season, which was also played as four 10-minute periods. Lowes was twice removed from the game with minor penalty for dropping to his knees with John Stephenson subbing into the goal in both instances. During one of those occurrences, Stephenson allowed the only goal from Hamilton but that did not stop Williams from being to finish the season with a win.\nAfter the season, Williams tabulated the cost of running its athletic programs and found that ice hockey, which had been budgeted for $1,000 had a slight overrun and came in at $1,025.48.\nWilliam Quaintance Jr. served as team manager with Benjamin Fawcett as his assistant.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "Sharp Park Golf Course",
        "text": "Sharp Park Golf Course is a public golf course in Pacifica in Northern California in the United States. It was designed in 1931 by Alister MacKenzie and is owned and operated by the city of San Francisco. It is the only public oceanside golf course designed by MacKenzie in the United States.\nU.S. Open champion Ken Venturi described the course as \"Dr. MacKenzie's great gift to the American public course golfer.\"\nHistory.\nIn 1930, Golden Gate Park Superintendent John McLaren commissioned the Scottish course architect Alister MacKenzie to design San Francisco's third municipal golf links. The course was built on 120 acres of coastal property bequeathed to the city in 1917 by the wealthy San Francisco widow Honora Sharp. She stipulated it was to be used as a “public park or playground.” Sharp Park was designed by MacKenzie in-between designing his two most famous courses, Cypress Point Club and Augusta National.\nAt the time of its donation, the site primarily consisted of wetlands, artichoke fields, and sand dunes. Through 1931, the property's ocean lagoon was deepened and converted into a fresh-water lake, and fairways and tees were sited on islands and spits. MacKenzie included several of his signature design tropes, including cross bunkering, double fairways, multiple tees, mounded greens, undulating fairways, and optical illusions. \nThe Spanish Revival-style clubhouse was designed by an associate at Willis Polk's architecture firm and includes murals by the Works Progress Administration. The course debuted in 1932.\nIn the early 1940s, large storms washed out parts of MacKenzie's original routing, resulting in the construction of a seawall to protect the course. From 1942 until 1946, the area east of the golf course was used by the War Relocation Authority as a Japanese internment camp. In 2011, San Francisco mayor Ed Lee vetoed a measure for the National Park Service to take over operations at Sharp Park.\nLayout.\nSharp Park's routes feature Monterey cypress, with views of the Pacific headlands and surrounding mountains. Twelve of the course holes retain their original routing. Changes have included an added seawall at holes 12 and 16, which are directly on the shore, as well as an additional four holes designed in 1934 which are accessible via a tunnel.\nHistoric Status.\nIn 2017, Sharp Park Golf Course was designated a Historic Resource Property under the California Environmental Quality Act. In a statement to NBC, architect Jay Blasi stated, \"They are not making any more MacKenzies near the Pacific... This is a one-of-a-kind in the world of golf.\"\nEnvironmental concerns.\nThe area around the course is home to two endangered species, the San Francisco garter snake and the California red-legged frog. As a result, the city of San Francisco faced multiple lawsuits by environmental organizations to protect the species, sparking what became known as the “Save Sharp Park” movement. In 2017, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted 9-to-1 to certify an environmental impact report to modify three holes to protect the species' habitats."

His father, Jimmy, played first grade rugby league at or for Brisbane clubs Wests and Souths, later becoming coach of the Wynnum-Manly club. His mother, June, was a Queensland representative netball player. Like his brother Wally, Lewis was a Fortitude Valley junior. According to his nephew Lincoln, Lewis and his brother are butchers by trade.\nRugby League career.\nLewis made his first-grade debut for Fortitude Valley in round 11 of the 1983 season, playing two games at halfback after an injury to Ross Henrick.\nDuring the 1983-84 offseason, Lewis followed his older brother to Wakefield Trinity, making his debut for the club in their 16–32 loss to Hull F.C. in round 15. Lewis played 5 games in the centres for the English club and once on the wing, scoring a total of 6 tries. Lewis scored his first career double in Wakefield's 28–22 win over Oldham in round 17.\nIn the 1984 season, Lewis remained at Fortitude Valley despite his brother Wally's move to Wynnum-Manly. Lewis gave an impressive performance in the 1984 Woolies Pre-season, being hospitalised with a hip injury in Round 3 but returning to score a try in the side's 24–12 win over Eastern Suburbs in round 4. Lewis also scored a try in all 3 of Fortitude Valley's first-grade matches in the Winfield State League, including the only try in Valleys 9–8 win over Redcliffe in Round 5. Despite this, Lewis failed to earn a place in Fortitude Valley's starting side for the regular season until round 12, when he replaced Scott Nicholls on the wing and scored a try in the Diehards' 16–8 win over Past Brothers.

Lewis' first appearance for the club came in round 2 of the Woolies Pre-season, where he moved from the wing to halfback late in the match and scored a 60-metre intercept try. Lewis was selected for the Brisbane rugby league team in the 1986 National Panasonic Cup, and played in the side's 10–18 loss to the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles on 16 April, scoring a try. After spending most of the pre-season in the halves, Lewis moved back to the wing for his first-grade club debut in round 1 of the regular season. Lewis played in the centres in Wynnum-Manly's 12–20 loss to his old club, Fortitude Valley, in round 6 of the regular season. Lewis scored his first try for the Seagulls in their 16–36 loss to Redcliffe in round 7. Lewis scored the first try in the 1986 Woolies Trophy match, contested between Wynnum-Manly and Fortitude Valley between rounds 12 and 13 of the BRL season. The next week, Lewis scored his first BRL double in Wynnum-Manly's 46–12 win over Eastern Suburbs. Lewis played on the wing in the 1986 BRL Grand Final against Past Brothers, which Wynnum-Manly won 14–6.\nLewis remained with Wynnum-Manly in 1987, primarily playing on the wing. He scored a double in the Seagulls' 24–0 victory over Redcliffe in round 5 of the Woolies Pre-Season competition. Lewis also scored a double in the Seagulls' 36–14 victory over Redcliffe in the 1987 Winfield State League Final.\nLewis signed with the newly formed Brisbane Broncos in 1988, but was injured and forced into retirement prior to the season commencing, never playing a game for the club."

        "title": "1929–30 Bates Bobcats men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1929–30 Bates men's ice hockey season was the 11th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nUnder new bench boss Dave Morey, the Bobcats entered the season with a strong lineup headed by center and team captain Johnny Cogan. With Secor and McCluskey on the wings, the forward contingent was expected to be a powerful combination for the Garnet while he defense sorted itself out. Anderson, who had played at wing last year, was moved back to defense and joined by new entry Ben White. Sid Farrell was expected to return as the starting goaltender, however, he was unable to play at the start of the year and John Manning took his place in goal. Despite the expectations, the team got off to a slow start when they travelled to Brunswick as the ice there was covered in slush. With both teams playing slow as a result, the Bobcats were unable to get much offense going and fell 1–2 with Cogan potting the goal.\nAfter the lack of scoring, the lineup was changed with Anderson moving back to wing and McCluskey dropping back to the blueline. Kenison was added as a spare defenseman while Garcelon and Johnson joined in as reserve forwards to give the starters a breather when needed. Those moves were on full display when the team headed down to play New Hampshire a few days later and the changes paid off. Three different players scored against the Wildcats and it was just enough to earn the team a win over a strong UNH team. Soft ice was an issue in the next game but this time the team seemed better prepared. Two goals in the first staked Bates to a lead they would not relinquish and the Bobcats pulled even in the state series with a win over Colby.\nPoor weather prevented the team from practicing ahead of their road trip south and the Bobcats' condition was a relative unknown as they took on Army. The lack of ice time appeared to take its toll on the Garnet as they dropped both games and got their only goal from Johnson against Massachusetts Agricultural. Though Cogan got several scoring opportunities in both games, he was stymied by the defense on both occasions.\nThe Garnet returned home and immediately resumed their state series with Colby. The visiting Mules scored early but all that served to do was raise the ire of the Bobcats. Bates fired a sustained barrage of shots on goal but the enemy goalie held. However, in the third, McCluskey finally converted on a Cogan pass to tie the game and sent both teams scrambling for the go-ahead marker. Just as time was ticking down, Cogan managed to elude the checking of Draper and fired the winning goal off of a rush. The return game with the Aggies followed but Bates found itself on the short end once more. The forward line did some damage to MAC, however, Manning didn't play particularly well and cost his team a chance at victory. The last game before the exam break came against New Hampshire in a rematch. The two teams were evenly matched throughout with neither being able to score until the final minutes of regulation. Cogan skated the length of the ice and fired the winning goal to lift the team back up to .500.\nUpon the team's return a few weeks later, they were looking for revenge against Bowdoin from the loss earlier in the season. Secor ended up having his best game of the season, scoring twice to lead the team to victory and a stranglehold on the state series. Joe Murphy played in his first game of the season while McCluskey and Johnson play a major part in deciding the outcome. A week later the team's series with Colby came to a close with a 5–5 tie. The Mules started fast and had Bates hemmed in their own end for most of the first period, however, they could only manage one goal. The match broke open in the second with 7 goals being scored. Bates tallied three times before Colby responded and the two eventually finished tied at 4-all. The third ended with the same score and sent both teams into overtime. Secor scored early in the frame but the game was soon knotted again and remained there until time was called.\nAs the team prepared for their final game against Bowdoin, the result of the Colby series meant that all they needed was a tie to win the state championship. Unfortunately, the weather was not accommodating and water had to be removed from the rink prior to the match. Soft ice slowed the match but Cogan, in his final match, played probably his best game for the Bobcats. The speedy center scored all four of the Garnet goals en route to a 4–1 win and give Bates the state championship in not only hockey but track, baseball and football over the previous year.\nRichard Gilbert served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "1920–21 Williams Ephs men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1920–21 Williams Ephs men's ice hockey season was the 18th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAs the season was getting underway, Williams put together a slate of nine games with the first coming just before the winter break. Due to the Cole Field House Rink not yet being frozen, the team held all of their practiced inside the Lasell Gymnasium. As the first game neared, however, the weather remained too warm and the match on December 18 with Rensselaer was cancelled. The poor ice would not abate and caused the cancellation of two further games (YMCA College and Harvard) which forced Williams to hit the road.\nThe team's first game came against the Albany Country Club and, despite the lack of ice time for the players, they were far superior to the amateur group. The Ephs got goals from all three forwards and, though there was still some kinks in their game, the final score of 4–0 was very flattering. A few days later, the team was in Amherst and appeared to be in much better shape, at least as far as teamwork was concerned. Williams played a sound defensive game and limited the Lord Jeffs to few scoring opportunities. While Richmond did allow one goal to get by him, Becket and Clark each found the twine to give the Ephs their second win of the season.\nIt took several weeks for the next game to happen and, fortunately, the weather had cooled off enough for Cole Field House Rink to be used. Because the ice was choppy, the game was limited to 15 minute halves but that didn't stop Williams from proving that they were the superior team. Once more, each forward scored a goal and the Ephs skated away with a 3–0 win to take the season series over Amherst. When the team haeded down to play Columbia, they had to radically alter their lineup for the game. Because the Lions played under the more modern 6-man, 3-period format, Williams was forced to follow suit and alternate between Stephenson and Clark at left wing. Despite the difference in style, Williams was easily the better of the two teams and outskated Columbia throughout the match. Becket scored a hat-trick with Clark and Rowse adding one apiece to give the Purple an easy 5–1 win.\nThe next game was supposed to be played versus Dartmouth a few days later, but a sudden thaw forced that match to be scrapped. Instead, Williams headed down to play Army and encountered the same problem. The warm winter had rendered the Stuart Rink unusable so the two were forced to play on the Lusk Reservoir. Soft, slushy ice slowed the game down and made passing all but impossible. Somehow, Clark managed to score twice, the second of which came in overtime and won the game for Williams. A week later the team headed up to Hanover for the final game of the year and were doing so in a rarified position. While it would be unlikely for the Ephs to be named as champion, if Williams could finish the year with a spotless record and a win over one of college hockey's powerhouse teams, they would at least have to be considered for the honor. Even with the spotty practice, the team had already proven to be a formidable group. However, as soon as the match began, the Purple had a problem. the opposing rover, Bowers, was a demon on skates and raced up and down the ice. the Williams defense had an impossible task in checking him but did their best to limit his chances. Unfortunately, Dartmouth was able to utilize Bowers' speed to jump out to a 2–0 lead in the first. The Eph forwards clawed back to tie the game by the end of the second but the bottom fell out in the third. Dartmouth scored three timed in the final frame to take the game 6–4 and end Williams' championship hopes.\nPhillip S. Patton served as team manager with Donald Crouse as his assistant.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "2023 United States FIBA Basketball World Cup team",
        "text": "The United States men's national basketball team competed in the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup and finished in fourth place. They held training camp in early August and scheduled five exhibition games before their World Cup opener at the end of the month in Manila. The Americans were 4–1 during group play, qualifying for the final round. They lost in the semifinals as well as the bronze medal game. They were one of the top two World Cup finishers in the Americas, directly qualifying them for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.\nIt was Grant Hill's first major international tournament as president of USA Basketball, succeeding Jerry Colangelo. Steve Kerr was the new head coach, succeeding Gregg Popovich. The United States had won gold medals in two of the previous six World Cups, with the 2019 squad finishing in a disappointing seventh place.\nRoster.\nNew USA Basketball president Grant Hill dropped the requirement established by his predecessor, Jerry Colangelo, for multi-year commitments from players to build continuity. \"People's willingness and commitment to give two consecutive years to Team USA has changed, so we have to be able to adapt to the times\", said Hill. Since FIBA changed the World Cup in 2019 to occur a year prior to the Olympics, players were reluctant to play for the national team two years in a row, wanting a break from the long seasons of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Roster turnover in each tournament often led to lack of chemistry for the U.S. national team, which led to more individual play instead of teamwork. Team USA did not hold a training camp in 2022, as was previously customary during an \"off\" summer. No pool of players was named for the national team, ending the practice of trials and cuts based on candidates' performance in camp.\nThe American squad consisted of players who were each capable of both dominating the game or playing a complementary, off-ball role. It was constructed by Hill and head coach Steve Kerr to be fast and flexible, and players were selected with an emphasis on length, toughness, and ability to move the ball. The team featured four NBA All-Stars—Anthony Edwards, Tyrese Haliburton, Brandon Ingram and Jaren Jackson Jr.—all with one selection each; Edwards, Haliburton, and Jackson were recent All-Stars in 2023. However, it was the first U.S. national team of NBA players without any members named to the All-NBA Team. The number of All-NBAers on its World Cup teams had been trending lower, with the rise of non-Americans on All-NBA teams and stars opting to take a break in the offseason, while U.S. Olympic teams drew more A-list players.\nTeam USA's centers included Jackson, the 2023 NBA Defensive Player of the Year, who mostly played power forward with the Memphis Grizzlies. Their only true center was Walker Kessler, an effective inside defender and shot blocker, who was coming off his NBA rookie year. The Americans' other forwards who could play center included Paolo Banchero, the reigning NBA Rookie of the Year, and Bobby Portis. Banchero had verbally declared that he would play for Italy before officially committing to Team USA. Other players who were long and capable of defending multiple positions include Haliburton, Mikal Bridges, Josh Hart, Cameron Johnson and Austin Reaves. Reaves committed to the United States after considering playing for Germany. He was only the third undrafted player to play on a U.S. national team of NBAers.\nThe U.S. roster did not have any previous senior national team experience; some of the players have junior-level (19 years old and under) experience. Every prior national team of NBA players had at least two players with senior-level experience. Historically, the United States had focused on younger players looking to use the World Cup as a showcase for a potential future Olympic invite. The youngest squad in the 2023 World Cup with an average age of 24.6, each player for the Americans was 28 or younger.\nKerr won five NBA championships as a player and four as head coach of the Golden State Warriors. As a college player, he won gold on the 1986 U.S. team that won the FIBA World Championship, before it became known as the World Cup. Kerr's assistants included NBA coaches Tyronn Lue and Erik Spoelstra and college coach Mark Few. At the start of training camp, Kerr had his coaching staff write down who should be in the starting lineup. This resulted in the starters in their first scrimmage being Bridges, Ingram, Jackson, Johnson and Jalen Brunson. By the second scrimmage, Edwards replaced Johnson, and the starters remained the same throughout the exhibition games.\nExhibition games.\nTeam USA had one exhibition game in the United States, against Puerto Rico, before scheduled matches in Spain and the United Arab Emirates. The Americans finished 5–0, led by Anthony Edwards and his team-high 19.2 points per game on 51% shooting. They outscored their opponents by an average of 22.6 points per game, but had turnover issues in multiple contests and trailed in the second half against Spain and Germany. It was the first U.S. senior squad to go undefeated in warmup games since the 2016 Olympic team.\nPuerto Rico.\nEdwards had 15 points, four steals and four assists as the United States won 117–74 over Puerto Rico. The Americans led 50–43 at halftime before Edwards scored 11 points in the third quarter, when Team USA outscored Puerto Rico 34–18. The United States went on a 20–0 run from the end of the third to the start of the fourth quarter. Cameron Johnson scored 15 points off the bench to tie Edwards for the team high. The Americans won by 43 in spite of shooting just 6-for-27 on three-point field goals.\nStarting point guard Jalen Brunson had a double-double with 11 points and 12 rebounds. Tyrese Haliburton had seven points and a game-high 12 assists, as he and Austin Reaves combined for 16 assists and only two turnovers off the bench for Team USA. Jaren Jackson Jr. had 12 points, seven rebounds and two blocks but battled with foul trouble. Somewhat unexpectedly, Paolo Banchero played significant minutes as his backup at center, at times over Bobby Portis. Banchero plays more as a forward with the Orlando Magic. U.S. head coach Steve Kerr liked his ability to push the ball in transition as a center, as Bam Adebayo did for the 2020 Olympic team.\nSlovenia.\nEdwards led a balanced U.S. attack, scoring 15 points in a 92–62 win over Slovenia. All-NBA guard Luka Dončić missed the game for the Slovenians as a precaution after landing awkwardly in their previous game. Brunson added 11 points and eight assists for the Americans. Josh Hart made his debut for Team USA after missing the previous game while signing a four-year contract extension with the New York Knicks. All 12 U.S. players scored.\nSpain.\nBrunson scored a game-high 23 points on a perfect 9-for-9 shooting from the field to lead the United States to a 98–88 win over Spain. The Americans led 73–72 to start the fourth quarter, but scored seven consecutive points late in the game to extend its lead to 97–84. They shot 67% overall, including 71% on 2-pointers and 56% on 3-pointers. Their defense held Spain to 42% shooting. Jackson added 14 points, five rebounds and three blocks for Team USA while playing against NBA-sized big men Santi Aldama and brothers Willy and Juancho Hernangómez.\nThe Americans led at halftime by 10, but committed seven turnovers in the third quarter, as the Spaniards closed the gap and took the lead with under four minutes left in the period. Edwards, the leading U.S. scorer through the first two games, scored seven of his 11 in the final quarter. Haliburton had 12 assists in slightly less than 22 minutes off the bench for the Americans. Brunson also had five assists. According to FIBA, Spain was ranked the No. 1 team in the world, and the United States was No. 2.\nGreece.\nEdwards scored a game-high 21 points in 18 minutes in a 108–86 win over Greece. The Greeks did not have Giannis Antetokounmpo, who was unavailable for the World Cup after offseason knee surgery. Team USA led by as many as 17 in the first period, but they committed four turnovers in a span of six possessions in the second quarter, as Greece pulled to within six points. However, Edwards scored 11 points in the third quarter, including three 3's, and the United States stretched their lead to as many as 20.\nEdwards shot 8-of-16 from the field for the game, and did not play in the fourth quarter. He was among six Americans to score in double figures, including starters Jackson (11 points) and Mikal Bridges (10) and reserves Johnson (13), Reaves (11) and Portis (10). Brunson led the United States with seven assists. Kerr modified his rotation, inserting Walker Kessler as the first man off the bench in the first quarter. Kessler had played the least with seven minutes through three games. He finished the game with seven points, five rebounds, four fouls and a block. Team USA had 20 turnovers in the game, which led to 24 points for Greece. The Americans outrebounded the Greeks 49–35.\nGermany.\nEdwards scored 34 points and his defense helped rally Team USA from a 16-point second-half deficit to win 99–91 over Germany. The Americans trailed 71–55 with 3:51 remaining in the third quarter. They rallied behind Haliburton, who scored 11 of his 16 points in the quarter, including a 3-pointer to cut the deficit to 74–71 with :56 remaining. Team USA held the Germans scoreless during a six-minute span in the fourth quarter, outscoring them 18–0. Edwards scored 12 points in the final period. Haliburton finished the game ahead of starter Brunson due to his defense and playmaking ability. Another bench player, Reaves, also finished the game and scored 16 points. Portis and Banchero were also on the floor during critical minutes.\nEdwards was 11-of-21 from the field and shot a perfect 8-of-8 on free throws, adding four 3s and six rebounds. \"He's unquestionably 'the guy,'\" Kerr said. \"I mean...he knows it, but now the team knows it and I think the fans see it.\" Jackson had eight rebounds and six blocks. German point guard Dennis Schröder had 16 points and 10 assists, while attacking the Americans with his speed and beating his defenders with pick and rolls. He set up his fellow NBA teammates Franz Wagner (17 points), Mo Wagner (14) and Daniel Theis (12). Germany outrebounded the United States 55–42 and had a 21–7 advantage in second-chance points. Theis had 13 rebounds and Franz Wagner had 10.\nGroup phase.\nFirst round.\nThe United States played in Group C with Greece, Jordan, and New Zealand. Their games were played at Mall of Asia Arena in Manila. The top two finishers advanced to the second round, where they will compete against the top two finishers from Group D.\nThe Americans won all three of their opening games by an average margin of 34, winning each by at least 27. They were one of three teams in the World Cup to win all of their opening round games by 20 or more, joining Group H winner Canada and Group D winner Lithuania, who the United States played in their second-round finale. Edwards was Team USA's leading scorer, averaging 16.3 points per game.\n\"All times are Philippine Standard Time (UTC+8)\"\nNew Zealand.\nReaves had 12 points, six assists and three steals off the bench to help the United States overcome a sluggish start and win 99–72 over New Zealand. The Kiwis jumped out to an early 14–4 lead with 5:48 left in the first quarter, while the Americans missed five shots and committed four turnovers in their initial 11 possessions. Kerr used 10 players in the first quarter, pulling all the starters except Bridges after the first few minutes. Reaves and Haliburton came in and turned the game around. Team USA tied the game with a 12–2 run, and they went ahead for good after a 3-pointer by Haliburton with 6:58 remaining in the first half. The Americans led 45–36 at halftime after committing 10 turnovers in the first half and shooting just 3-of-10 on 3-pointers. They led by 12 with 2:01 left in the third quarter, when Banchero made consecutive 3s to expand the U.S. lead to its largest of the game at that point.\nBanchero made his first six shots of the game and finished with 21 points in 19 minutes off the bench. He had a plus–minus of +22, Reaves was +19, and Haliburton was +13 along with 10 points. After four first-half turnovers, Edwards finished with 14 points and a team-leading seven rebounds. Jackson had 12 points on a perfect 4-of-4 shooting from the field and 4-of-4 on free throws, adding four rebounds before fouling out. Ingram struggled with two points on 1-of-4 shooting. Expected to be a scoring threat at power forward, he averaged 7.8 points and made only 42% of his shots during the exhibition games. New Zealand, which did not have any NBA players on its roster, were led by Reuben Te Rangi with 15 points.\nGreece.\nReaves had a team-high 15 points along with five rebounds and six assists in a 109–81 win over Greece, which assured the Americans that they would advance to the second round of the World Cup. Team USA again extended their lead with their reserves playing. Led once more by Reaves, the bench outscored the Greeks by 11 in the first half, compared to the starters having a +2 advantage. The starting unit quickly stretched Team USA's lead to 20 in the third quarter, and the United States led by 23 entering the fourth.\nBrunson had 13 points on 5-of-5 shooting, and Edwards also scored 13 after starting the game shooting 1-of-6. Jackson had nine points, two steals and two blocks. Hart led the team in rebounding with 11 off the bench. Greek center Georgios Papagiannis, a lottery pick of the Phoenix Suns in the 2016 NBA draft, scored 11 of his 17 points in the first quarter to keep the game close early. However, Greece did not have a solution for the Americans' fast-paced bench, and the United States had a 32–6 advantage in fast-break points.\nJordan.\nEdwards scored 22 points and Team USA won 110–62 against Jordan in their easiest win of the opening round. The United States, who went up 20–4 early, led by 19 after the first quarter and 62–33 by halftime. It was a departure from their slow starts in the first two games as well as their exhibition games, when they took control once Haliburton and Reaves came off the bench. Edwards had 18 points at the half after 13 in the opening period.\nPortis scored 13 points for Team USA, Jackson added 12, and Brunson had 10. All 12 Americans scored by the end of the third quarter, and each played at least 12 minutes in the game. Edwards, who played 19 minutes, also had had eight rebounds, four assists, and three 3-pointers, as the United States outscored Jordan by 30 when he was playing. Jackson added six rebounds and two blocks. Kessler, who had received limited playing time, scored eight points and had three blocks in 12 minutes. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Jordan's only player with NBA experience, led his squad with 20 points and seven rebounds.\nKerr changed the starting lineup for the first time, inserting Hart for Ingram, who had struggled while being mostly a spot-up shooter. The Americans had been +10 with Ingram on the court and +45 when he was not playing. Against Jordan, he and Banchero were the first reserves to enter the game. Playing off the bench, Ingram was able to handle the ball more, which he was more accustomed to with the New Orleans Pelicans. His opportunities were more limited in the starting lineup with Brunson and Edwards, while Haliburton and Reaves moved the ball well on the second unit. Ingram seemed more comfortable, finishing with five assists and seven points in 15 minutes in his best game to date. In his new role, Hart had a team-high 12 rebounds in 18 minutes, and concentrated on defense. A tireless rebounder despite standing just , he helped bolster the team's defensive rebounding, one of their few weaknesses. He also had experience playing alongside fellow starters Bridges and Brunson, his college teammates for two seasons with Villanova.\nSecond round.\nThe playing field was reduced from 32 teams in the first round to 16 in the second. The top two teams from Group C and Group D advanced to Group J, with their records from the first round being carried over. Each team played against the two teams that they did not play in the opening round. The United States defeated Montenegro before losing to Lithuania. The Americans trailed at halftime for the first time against Montenegro. In both second-round games, they were outrebounded by a combined 92–58, surrendering 41 offensive rebounds and being outscored 39–5 on second-chance points. Their starting center, Jackson, had just one rebound and was plagued by foul trouble. It was the third consecutive global tournament in which Team USA suffered a loss, after going undefeated in Olympics or World Cups in 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016. The Americans (4–1) and Lithuanians (5–0) finished as the group's top two teams to advance to the quarterfinals in the final round, which consisted of the top eight remaining teams.\nMontenegro.\nEdwards scored all 17 of his points in the second half, helping the United States pull away late in an 85–73 win over Montenegro. The Americans trailed 11–4 early, and Montenegro led 39–38 at halftime. Team USA shot just 35% in the first half, including 1-of-9 on 3-pointers, and were outrebounded 28–17. They led 61–55 after three quarters, but the Montenegrans led as late as seven minutes left in the third, and pulled to within 64–62 with 7:15 remaining in the game. The Americans prevailed in large part due to the play of guards Edwards, Haliburton, and Reaves. Similar to their comeback win in their exhibition match against Germany, Kerr had reserves Haliburton and Reaves close out the game. Two-time NBA All-Star Nikola Vučević had 18 points and 16 rebounds for Montenegro, helping them outrebound the United States 49–31, including 23 offensive rebounds for 22 second-chance points. They held an 11-rebound edge after the first quarter.\nJackson scored 11 points, but was in early foul trouble, and did not record a rebound. Due to the success of Montenegro's front line, Kessler entered the game earlier than usual. Ingram led the team with five rebounds off the bench. Banchero and Portis, backup big men who Kerr had been using the most, each added four boards. Haliburton had 10 points, a team-high six assists and two steals, and he finished the game instead of Brunson. Reaves scored 12 points, including a 3-pointer with 2:48 remaining in the game for a 75–68 lead, its largest advantage to that point. Bridges finished with a team-high +16. Team USA finished 5-of-19 on 3s for the game, and missed 10 free throws out of 30. With pressure from Haliburton, Reaves and Hart, the United States forced 22 turnovers by Montenegro. Coupled with Lithuania's win over Greece, the Americans qualified for the quarterfinals.\nLithuania.\nVaidas Kariniauskas scored 15 points as Lithuania won 110–104, handing the United States its first loss of the World Cup. Entering the game shooting a tournament-leading 44% on 3s, the Lithuanians made their first nine 3-pointers to establish a 31–12 lead after one quarter and a 21-point advantage by early in the second. Trailing by 17 points at halftime, the Americans outscored the Lithuanians 9–0 to begin the second half, part of a 15–2 run over a 4:16 span to cut the lead to four. The United States was within 71–65 entering the fourth quarter, but Lithuania led for the remainder of the game. Brunson made two free throws with 16.2 seconds remaining to bring Team USA within four. They stole the subsequent inbounds pass, but Bridges missed a 3-pointer from the corner. Lithuania, which had also been the World Cup's top rebounding team, outrebounded the United States 43–27, including 18 offensive rebounds for 17 second-chance points. Both teams had already clinched a spot in the quarterfinals, and the game's outcome only impacted seeding. After losses by Brazil, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, Team USA also qualified for the 2024 Olympics as one of the top two World Cup finishers from the Americas.\nEdwards led the Americans with 35 points, three short of Kevin Durant's U.S. World Cup scoring record. Brunson and Bridges added 14, and Ingram had 10. Jackson got into foul trouble with two fouls in the first three minutes, and picked up his third in the middle of the second quarter. His only rebound was in the middle of the third quarter, and he fouled out in the fourth. The United States was +16 in the 15 minutes that he played and -22 when he was on the bench. Kerr tried without success to play Kessler with another big man in the first half, before returning to a smaller frontcourt in the second half. Reaves has his worst game to date of the tournament, fouling out with seven points in 13 minutes. He was targeted on defense by the Lithuanians, who posted him up with larger players.\nJonas Valančiūnas, Lithuania's only NBA player, had 12 points and seven rebounds. The Lithuanians started three players or taller, with others on the bench. Several were former NBA players. Their team had seven players score in double figures, and two others had nine points each. Lithuania shot 14-of-25 on 3s, including several tough shots, while the United States was 11-of-29. Lithuania had nine players make at least one 3-pointer.\nFinal round.\nThe United States advanced to the final round in which the top two teams from the respective second-round groups qualified in the single-elimination tournament.\nQuarterfinals – Italy.\nBridges scored 24 points in a 100–63 win over Italy, as Team USA advanced to the medal round. The Americans were leading 10–8 in the first quarter when the second unit came in and expanded the lead to 24–14 after the first quarter. They were up 46–24 by halftime. It was Italy's worst loss in a global tournament in nearly 55 years. The United States held them to 31% shooting and just 18% (7-of-38) on 3-pointers.\nHaliburton scored 18 points on six 3-pointers and led the team with five assists. Reaves added 12 points. For the third straight game, Jackson was in foul trouble early, with two fouls in the first 2:14. Team USA outrebounded Italy 51–33. NBA forward Simone Fontecchio had 18 points to lead Italy.\nSemifinals – Germany.\nAndreas Obst scored 24 points and Franz Wagner had 22 as Germany won 113–111 to oust the United States from gold medal contention. The Americans shot 58% for the game, but allowed the Germans to make 58% as well. Germany outscored Team USA 35–24 in the third quarter and were up by 10 in the middle of the fourth. Twice the United States pulled to within one point in the closing minutes. Germany entered as the last remaining unbeaten team in the World Cup. They led for about 30 minutes of the game, compared to by the Americans.\nGermany took advantage of Team USA's smaller lineup with 12 offensive rebounds compared to seven for the Americans, leading to a 25–8 edge in second-chance points. They also shot an excellent 13-of-30 on 3-pointers. Edwards had 23 points for the United States and Reaves scored 21. Ingram missed the game with a respiratory illness.\nThird place – Canada.\nCanada's Dillon Brooks scored 39 points and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 31 points and 12 assists to lead the Canadians to the bronze medal in a 128–117 overtime win over the Americans. It was their first medal in a global men's basketball tournament in 87 years. The United States came back from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter. They were down by four with 4.2 seconds in regulation when Bridges made his first free throw before intentionally missing the second, which he rebounded in the right corner before making a 3-pointer with 0.6 seconds left. In overtime, Canada scored the first five points and never trailed. Team USA played without Jackson, Banchero, and Ingram due to illness. It was the first World Cup or Olympics that they surrendered 100 or more points in three games; they were 0–3 in those contests.\nCanada outshot the United States on 3-pointers, 17 of 37 (46%) versus 10 of 27 (37%). Their last medal at a global tournament was silver at the 1936 Olympics. Edwards scored 24 points for the Americans and Reaves added 23. The United States failed to medal at consecutive World Cups for the first time since 1967 and 1970. Their last team to lose three games in a global tournament was its 2004 Olympic team."

        "text": "The 1928–29 Colgate men's ice hockey season was the 6th season of play for the program. The team was coached by Raymond A. Watkins in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nAfter experiencing a great deal of trouble with their home rink in 1928, the school decided to build a new temporary rink. Aside from the improvements in drainage the new rink measured in at 190' by 85'. After work had begun, the school announced that Raymond A. Watkins, who had recently been hired to coach the freshman teams at the school, agree to helm the ice hockey program. While Watkins had not played the game previously, he had coached the team at Bates a few years earlier and would be assisted by J. Howard Starr who had been on the ice hockey team at YMCA College.\nThe team began practicing on Taylor Lake while they waited for the weather to cool off. Due in part to the poor experience the year before, the team did not bother to schedule any intercollegiate games until February. In the meantime, however, the Maroons received a welcome cold snap in the first half of January that allowed the team to get some on-ice practice. The club played an exhibition match against an amateur club from Clinton in mid-January and lost 3–4. The team played terribly in the first period, allowing three goals against in a span of just 3 minutes, but they soon found their skating legs and made a game of it fir the rest of the contest. Unfortunately, due to inclement weather, the team was unable to continue its exhibition calendar and had to cancel the rest of their January matches.\nColgate faced a trial by fire at the opening of their season and ended up getting burned by Dartmouth. Hampered by a lack of practice time leading into the match, the Maroons were overwhelmed by one of the top teams in college hockey. The offense was unable to keep pace with the fast Indian skaters. The Green were in control for the entire game and hardly let Colgate out of its own end. Only a goal from Hofheins in the second prevented the team from being shutout. Three days later the team went on the road to play Cornell. The defense had a much stronger performance in the second game, however, the offense was still lacking. Howe's lone goal was insufficient to keep in the game on slow, soft ice.\nA week later the team was in Schenectady to take on Union and had a near-identical performance to the Cornell game. After allowing the opening goal, Howe tied the game in the second but, with the rest of the team unable to score, the Maroons lost again. At this point, Colgate had lost 11 consecutive games and had not been in the win column since 1921. Just as it appeared that the team might be staring down at another winless season, the Maroons completely turned their season against Army. The two teams matched one another closely in the first period but, once the second began, everything tilted in Colgate's favor. Three goals followed in the second and the avalanche kept coming with a further 4 in the third. Hofheins led the way with a hat-trick and lifted the Marrons to victory.\nThe Maroons carried their newfound confidence into the next game with St. Lawrence and won an overtime match thanks to the exploits of Howe and Hofheins. The end of the week saw Cornell arrive for the rematch and fought a pitched battle with the Big Red. Chambers allowed the opening goal of the game but refused entry to every shot thereafter. Hofheins tied the score before too long and set up a mildly controversial call from referee. After a pile-up in front of the Cornell net, Earnie Paul disentangled the jumble of players only to find the puck in the cage. Nelson was credited with the goal and the Colgate defense managed to hold on to their lead until the end of the match.\nColgate was suddenly sitting in a position to finish the year with a winning record and had just Hamilton left to contend with. The defense played a stout game throughout the match, turning aside chance after chance from the Continentals. Spelder and Barnes were instrumental in keeping the scoresheet empty and sending the match into overtime. A penalty by Spelder gave Hamilton a chance in the extra session but Chambers kept the puck out of the goal and enabled Hofheins to score with just over a minute left. The win gave Colgate its first winning season in over a decade.\nPaul Wish served as team manager.\nNote: Colgate's athletic teams did not have a moniker until 'Red Raiders' was adopted in 1932.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The Crimson represented Harvard University in the 2023–24 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season, played their home games at Bright-Landry Hockey Center and were coached by Ted Donato in his 19th season.\nSeason.\nDespite losing their top four scorers and starting goaltender from the previous season, Harvard was in the top-20 from earliest polls. To replace the departed talent, three NHL draftees were among the crop of freshman looking to help the Crimson return to the NCAA tournament. Unfortunately, very little went right for Harvard during the season. From the outset, the goaltending tandem of Koskenvuo and Mullahy did not play well enough to give the team a chance most nights. Over the course of the season, Harvard's goals against average was nearly a full goal more than it was the year before. Though Koskenvuo did possess marginally better numbers, it wasn't sufficient to give him the starting role outright.\nCompounding the team's problems was a vast reduction in goal scoring. The team was unable to replace the offensive production lost to the professional ranks and, though three freshman did finish in the top 5 in team scoring (Callow, Johnson and MacDonald), their total combined contributions were less than what Harvard had received from Sean Farrell. Harvard scored 55 fewer goals than they had in 2023 and finished as one of the worst offensive teams in the nation. The team's situation was particularly dire in the first half of the year as the Crimson won just once in its first 14 games. Some improvements were seen in the second half but in the end Harvard posted one of its worst campaigns in decades. The seven wins on the year was the lowest number for the program since 1979.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"

The Tigers represented Princeton University, played their home games at the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink and were coached by Ron Fogarty in his 9th season.\nSeason.\nPrinceton had a decent start to its season, seeing consistent scoring in the first three weeks. With a winning record as they approached Thanksgiving, which included a win over a ranked Cornell squad, the Tigers looked better than they had in years. The only apparent issue at this time was in goal as the team had already started three separate netminders with none of them playing particularly well. By December, Arthur Smith assumed the lead role but that was as much a function of how poorly Ethan Pearson had played as anything else.\nWhen the Tigers began the second half of their season, they had a winning record but had played mostly subpar teams. Their record was set to be tested as they would play five consecutive games against ranked opponents. Unfortunately for Princeton, they did not fare well. The offense struggled to score, averaging less than two goals per in that stretch, while the defense collapsed. The Tigers' goal crease came under siege, seeing at least 35 shots in four of those matches and the inadequate goaltending was fully exposed. Even after the team passed through the gauntlet, the goals against continued to mount; Princeton allowed at least 3 goals in every game for a month and a half. Though the offense recovered slightly once they started playing weaker opponents once more, the Tigers still went 2–9 in that stretch and tumbled down the conference standings. By the end of February the team had not only abandoned any hope of earning a bye into the quarterfinal round but they were barely clinging onto a home game in the first round. Ending the year with two losses knocked them down to 9th and forced them to travel to Boston for their playoff opener.\nPrinceton largely outplayed Harvard in the match, outshooting the Crimson by 21 while taking only a single penalty. Unfortunately, the Tigers picked the worst time to stop scoring and the single goal allowed by Smith was all that Harvard needed to end the Tigers' season.\nAfter getting knocked out of the postseason, Princeton's athletic director, John Mack, announced that Ron Fogarty would not be returning as head coach.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nRankings.\n&lt;br&gt;"
