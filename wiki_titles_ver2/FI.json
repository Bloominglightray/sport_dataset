        "text": "Matthew Joseph McMahon (born April 26, 1978) is the current men's college basketball head coach for LSU. McMahon was formerly the men’s basketball coach at Murray State. In his third year leading the program, McMahon led the Racers to a 26–6 record that included Ohio Valley Conference regular-season and tournament championships. He played college basketball at Appalachian State University.\nPlaying career.\nOak Ridge High School.\nMcMahon played high school basketball at Oak Ridge High School in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.\nAppalachian State.\nA 6-foot-1 shooting guard, McMahon was a regular player under head coach Buzz Peterson at Appalachian State from 1996 to 2000. The Mountaineers posted a 65–25 record over his last three years, finishing with an NCAA Tournament appearance in 2000. During those years, McMahon averaged 6.9 points in 90 games, hitting 37.5 percent (124 of 331) of his 3-point attempts. He graduated in 2000 with a bachelor's degree in marketing.\nCoaching career.\nAppalachian State (first stint).\nAfter his playing career, McMahon stayed on at Appalachian State as a student assistant men's basketball coach under head coach Houston Fancher in 2000–01.\nTennessee.\nMcMahon then rejoined his former coach Buzz Peterson for a season as a graduate assistant coach at Tennessee from 2001 to 2002.\nAppalachian State (second stint).\nFollowing his year at Tennessee, McMahon returned to Appalachian State in 2002 as a full-time assistant under Fancher. He remained there through the end of the 2009-2010 season.\nUNC Wilmington.\nIn 2010, McMahon again joined Peterson, this time as an assistant at UNC-Wilmington, before then joining Steve Prohm's staff at Murray State as assistant coach in 2011.\nMurray State.\nAt Murray State under Prohm, McMahon helped guide the Racers to 104 victories in four years, including appearances in the 2012 NCAA tournament, the 2015 National Invitation Tournament, and the 2014 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament, where the Racers won the tournament championship.\nIn 2012, FoxSports.com and CollegeInsider.com ranked McMahon as one of college basketball's best assistant coaches, while in 2015 he was tabbed as one of \"9 Under-the-Radar Coaches to Watch\" by NCAA.com.\nMcMahon was hired as an assistant to Eric Konkol at Louisiana Tech on May 27, 2015. He held this role for only a few weeks, as on June 10, 2015, McMahon returned to Murray State to become head coach of the Racers. He replaced Prohm, who left to take the head coach position at Iowa State University.\n\"I am so excited to know that Coach McMahon will be returning to Murray State to lead the Racers,\" Murray State athletic director Allen Ward said. \"After watching him for four years, I'm convinced he's the right man for the job. He's an outstanding coach, nationally recognized as one of the top assistants in the country, with a tremendous upside. Matt has the talent and integrity to continue the momentum we've built, put his own stamp on the program, and meet the expectations that come with being the head coach at Murray State.\"\nMcMahon's third Racer team posted a 26–6 record, winning Ohio Valley Conference regular-season and tournament championships. They were awarded a 12 seed in the 2018 NCAA tournament, where they fell in the first round to West Virginia, 85–68. After the season, he was named National Association of Basketball Coaches District 19 Coach of the Year.\nIn his fourth year with the Racers he led future No. 2 NBA Draft pick Ja Morant and his teammates to their second straight OVC title, after sharing the regular season title with Belmont. The team upset Markus Howard and Marquette in the Round of 64, before falling to Florida State in the NCAA Tournament. The team would finish the season with a 28-5 overall record, while going 16-2 in conference play.\nOn April 5, 2019, McMahon was awarded a four-year contract extension which would have kept him at Murray State through the 2022–23 season had he not accepted a job at Louisiana State University in March 2022. McMahon's salary was increased from $300,000 a year to $500,000 a year.\nFollowing the close of the 2021–22 season, McMahon was named the OVC Coach of the Year. This was after McMahon guided the Racers to a 31-3 overall record, including going undefeated in the OVC at 18-0, winning both the OVC regular season and tournament championships, and reaching the NCAA Tournament Round of 32.\nLSU.\nOn March 21, 2022, McMahon was announced as the new men's basketball head coach at LSU, agreeing to a 7-year deal."

        "title": "2015–16 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2015–16 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 2015–16 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Hoyas, led by twelfth-year head coach John Thompson III, played their home games at the Verizon Center in Washington, D.C., and were members of the Big East Conference. They finished the season 15–18, 7–11 in Big East play to finish eighth place. They defeated DePaul in the first round of the Big East tournament to advance to the quarterfinals where they lost to Villanova. For the first time in John Thompson III's twelve years as head coach, the Hoyas did not make a postseason tournament.\nPrevious season.\nThe Hoyas finished the season with an overall record of 22–11, with a record of 12–6 in the Big East regular season for a second-place finish. In the 2015 Big East tournament, the Hoyas were defeated by Xavier, 65–63 in the semifinals. They were invited to the 2015 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as a #4 seed, where they defeated Eastern Washington in the second round before losing to Utah in the third round.\nSeason recap.\nGeorgetown had lost five players to graduation since the conclusion of the previous season. Most notably, center Joshua Smith, one of the team′s top scorers for the past two seasons and an important presence in Georgetown′s inside game during his abbreviated one-and-a-half-season career with the Hoyas, was gone. The graduation of Mikael Hopkins and Aaron Bowen meant the loss of two veteran forwards, while that of Jabril Trawick left the Hoyas shorthanded at guard. Also gone was guard David Allen who, after three seasons as a walk-on, did not return to the team for his senior year, as well as center Tyler Adams, an inspiration to the team from the sidelines during his Georgetown years but limited by heart arrhythmia to only five games in his four seasons at Georgetown.\nFive sophomores – guard Tre Campbell, small forward L. J. Peak, and forwards Isaac Copeland, Paul White, and Trey Mourning – returned for 2015–16, as did the team's only junior, power forward Reggie Cameron, and senior center Bradley Hayes. Senior guard Riyan Williams, the son of former Georgetown great Reggie Williams, also made the team as a walk-on for the third straight season. The most significant returnee was guard D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera, the team's top scorer for two straight seasons. After the conclusion of the previous season, Georgetown had announced that Smith-Rivera had decided to forego his senior year of college and enter the 2015 National Basketball Association draft, a sudden move that surprised observers, who had not ranked him highly as a National Basketball Association prospect. Smith-Rivera did not hire an agent, however, and, with his final year of college eligibility therefore intact, he decided a week later to withdraw his name from the draft pool and return to Georgetown for his senior year. Speaking publicly about his decision three weeks after that, Smith-Rivera had explained that he initially had decided to enter the NBA draft out of an abundance of confidence in himself and comfort with his abilities as a player, but that his parents had convinced him that returning to Georgetown and completing his education was a wiser choice.\nFreshmen who arrived for the season were center Jesse Govan, power forward Marcus Derrickson, and small forward Kaleb Johnson. Another newcomer was redshirt sophomore forward Akoy Agau. After seeing little action in three semesters at Louisville, Agau had transferred to Georgetown in January 2015. NCAA rules required him to sit out two full semesters before beginning play at Georgetown, but the Hoyas hoped that once Agau joined the team at mid-season in January 2016, he would help fill the gap left by the graduation of Hoya \"big men\" Joshua Smith and Mikael Hopkins, whose departure left the team weaker on inside offense, defense, and rebounding.\nSmith-Rivera′s decision to return for his senior year caused expectations for the 2015-16 Georgetown squad to soar. Although he was a shooting guard rather than a natural point guard, many observers thought that with him back to lead the team at point guard and with many other players also returning from the previous season, the Hoyas would have another successful season. They were projected as a Top 25 team that would finish second in the Big East and return to the NCAA Tournament for the second straight year.\nItaly trip.\nUnder NCAA rules, the Hoyas were allowed to make an overseas preseason trip to play exhibition games against foreign teams once every four years. Four years earlier, in August 2011, the Hoyas visited China to play three games against Chinese teams and one against a team from Taiwan, and during their second game had become involved in an ugly brawl with a Chinese professional team and Chinese fans in the stands, which resulted in John Thompson III pulling his team off the court and the game never being completed. In August 2015, Georgetown made another overseas trip, this time a 10-day visit to Italy. None of the players on the 2015–2016 team had been on the 2011–2012 team that visited China, but they were aware of the fight in China and hoped for a more peaceful and less controversial experience this time. Before the team left for the trip, Thompson told the press that he intended to use the exhibition schedule to give his players experience, and with that in mind, he would not necessarily play each game to win. The Hoyas played two games in Rome – against a team from Iceland and an Italian all-star team – and won both. After a stop in Pisa, they then traveled to Florence, where they lost to a team from Lithuania. Their final stop was Milan, from which they made a short drive across the border into Switzerland to defeat a Swiss team in a game played in Lugano, finishing their trip with a record of 3–1. Bradley Hayes made the trip but did not play because he was recovering from thumb surgery.\nAs the oldest Jesuit university in the United States, Georgetown had hoped that the team would be granted an audience with Pope Francis at the Vatican, but this proved impossible to arrange. However, the trip to Italy went far more smoothly than the 2011 visit to China, and the Hoyas took breaks from play to visit the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, Trevi Fountain, the Pantheon, the Altare della Patria, the Spanish Steps, St. Peter’s Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, and the Leaning Tower of Pisa.\nNonconference schedule.\nIn late October 2015, only about three weeks before the 2015–2016 season began, Georgetown announced that Akoy Agau had suffered a knee injury that would force him to miss the entire season. His Georgetown debut thus was postponed until the following year. The loss of Agau was a blow to Georgetown, which now faced unexpected weakness in its inside game, but it did little to dampen the overall enthusiasm for the team′s prospects for success, even though Paul White, the team′s leading scorer off the bench the previous year, began the season sidelined by a hip injury.\nIn November, Georgetown began its season by participating in the 2K Sports Classic, an annual tournament. The tournament′s format required the Hoyas to play a non-bracketed game at home against a mid-major opponent, then join three other major-conference schools in a bracketed tournament at Madison Square Garden to determine the tournament champion, and finally play a final, non-bracketed game at home against another mid-major team. For their opening mid-major opponent, the Hoyas faced Radford at the Verizon Center, and the Highlanders shocked the Hoyas by dealing them a double-overtime 82–80 loss, with Radford senior guard Rashaun Davis scoring a game-high and career-high 28 points. For Georgetown, Bradley Hayes had a double-double with 19 points and 12 rebounds, both career highs, while D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera scored 15 points, Isaac Copeland added 11, and Jesse Govan came off the bench to score 11.\nBefore departing for the championship portion of the tournament in New York City, Georgetown stepped away from the 2K Sports Classic to take part in the annual Gavitt Tipoff Games, a new series of eight games per year between teams of the Big East Conference and Big Ten Conference. This season, Georgetown′s Big Ten opponent was No. 3 Maryland, which the Hoyas met before a sellout crowd at the Xfinity Center on the University of Maryland campus. The game renewed the series between the two schools, which had been long-time cross-town rivals, but since 1979 relations had soured between them and they since had met in a non-tournament game only once, in 1993. The Gavitt Tipoff Game also was their first meeting in the Washington, D.C., area since the 1993 game. The first half saw six lead changes and four ties, and the game was tied 33–33 at halftime. In the second half the Hoyas had pulled out to a 44–37 lead when the officials called D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera for his fourth foul, forcing him to go to the bench with 14 minutes left to play. Maryland steadily reduced the Hoyas′ lead to 55–54, but Isaac Copeland scored on a lay-up and a three-pointer to give Georgetown a 61–54 lead with 5:41 remaining. The Terrapins then scored seven unanswered points to tie the game at 61–61. Terrapin senior guard Rasheed Sulaimon hit a decisive three-pointer, his only basket of the second half, to break a 68–68 tie with 1:18 remaining. Maryland sophomore guard Melo Trimble sank two free throws with 12 seconds left to stretch Maryland′s lead to five points, and the Terrapins hung on to win 75–71 and take a 37–27 lead in the all-time series between the teams. Maryland took 32 free throws during the game compared with 12 for Georgetown, The Georgetown starters had a balanced attack, with Bradley Hayes scoring a team-high 16 points and grabbing eight rebounds, Smith-Rivera adding 14 points, Copeland and Marcus Derrickson each contributing 13 points, and L. J. Peak scoring 12, but Jesse Govan, who fouled out with three points, was the only Georgetown bench player to score in the game. Georgetown opened with an 0–2 record for the first time since the 1998-1999 season.\nThree days later, the Hoyas were at Madison Square Garden and back in action in the 2K Sports Classic, seeking to avoid the first 0–3 start in Georgetown men's basketball history as they opened competition in the bracketed portion of the tournament with a game in the semifinal round. Georgetown met Wisconsin, which had defeated the Hoyas in their meeting in the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament the previous season. This year Wisconsin had a young team with eight freshman on the roster, and this time it was the Hoyas who prevailed over the Badgers, holding them to 1-for-10 (10 percent) three-point shooting in the first half and 5-for-19 (26.3 percent) from beyond the arc for the game; overall, the Badgers made only one of their first 13 field-goal attempts and shot 31.7 percent from the field. Meanwhile, the Hoyas, who entered the game shooting 36.6 percent in three-pointers, made 50 percent of their three-point attempts against Wisconsin on 9-for-18 shooting. Isaac Copeland led the Hoyas with 15 points, all scored in the second half, and D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera, who shot 1-for-7 from the field in the first half, recovered to finish with 12 points. Reggie Cameron and Jesse Govan both came off the bench to score in double figures, Cameron with a career-high 14 points – all in the first half – on 4-for-6 three-point shooting and Govan with 13 points. Georgetown led by as many as 14 points and came away with its first victory of the season, 71–61.\nThe Hoyas advanced to the 2K Sports Classic championship game, held two days later, to meet their second Top 5 opponent in six days, No. 5 Duke, which had defeated VCU in the semifinals. It was only the second time in history, and the first time since the 1989 NCAA tournament, that Georgetown and Duke met at a neutral site. Georgetown led 47–42 at halftime. The Blue Devils took the lead early in the second half, but the Hoyas moved ahead 54–53 on an L. J. Peak dunk with 17:10 left to play. Duke responded with a 10–0 run that gave the Blue Devils a 63–54 lead. The Hoyas closed the gap again, reducing Duke′s advantage to 70–69, but a Duke 7–0 run put the Blue Devils ahead 77–69 with 2:46 left in the game. Again the Hoyas closed, and a three-pointer by Isaac Copeland reduced Duke′s lead to 86–84 with seven seconds left. Georgetown had one final chance to tie or win after Blue Devils freshman guard Derryck Thornton missed two free throws, but Copeland′s three-pointer at the buzzer fell short and Duke won the game 86–84 to take the tournament championship. Duke sophomore guard Grayson Allen scored a career-high 32 points against the Hoyas on 9-for-12 shooting from the field, 5-for-6 in three-pointers, and 9-for-9 in free throws, along with five rebounds, four assists, and two steals. Georgetown shot 55 percent from the field, but Duke outrebounded the Hoyas 31–27 and held the advantage in scoring from the free throw line, going 28-for-36 in free throws compared to Georgetown′s 19-for-24. For Georgetown, Copeland led the team with 21 points, D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera added 14, and Kaleb Johnson also scored 14, coming off the bench to score in double figures for the first time in his college career. L. J. Peak contributed 13 points. The Hoyas settled for second place in the 2K Sports Classuc and the loss left Georgetown with its first 1–3 start since the 1971-1972 team opened 1–3 on the way to a 3–23 season.\nGeorgetown returned to the Verizon Center for a seven-game homestand. The first game of the homestand completed the Hoyas′ participation in the 2K Sports Classic with a non-bracketed game against Bryant, an easy win – giving Georgetown a 2–3 record to start a season for the first time since 1999-2000 – in which L. J. Peak scored 20 points, Isaac Copeland 12, Marcus Derrickson 11, and Bradley Hayes 10, and Paul White made his season debut after missing the first four games with a hip injury. Another easy home win followed against Maryland Eastern Shore in which D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera scored 30 points and moved into 16th place all time in scoring for Georgetown with 1,480 career points, while Hayes had 11 points and nine rebounds. The Hoyas evened their record at 3–3.\nA driving force in the success of the original Big East Conference of 1979–2013 during its 34 seasons of play was Georgetown′s rivalry with Syracuse, but play between the teams had come to an end after the conclusion of the 2012-13 season when the conference broke up during the summer of 2013. The original conference survived as the American Athletic Conference (marketed as \"the American\"), but Georgetown and Syracuse left it, the Hoyas to become a charter member of the new Big East Conference and the Orange to join the Atlantic Coast Conference, and they had gone two seasons without meeting. To renew the rivalry, the schools agreed to a home-and-home series in which Georgetown hosted Syracuse this season and would visit Syracuse the next season, with the hope that the teams would continue to meet annually after that. As a result, Georgetown's homestand continued with its first meeting with Syracuse since 2013. The No. 14 Orange were the Hoyas′ third ranked opponent of the season, and they arrived at the Verizon Center on December 5 with a record of 6–1, having lost their first game of the year to Wisconsin three days earlier. Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim, who had coached the Orange throughout the original Big East′s run, was not present, however, as he began serving a nine-game NCAA suspension that day because of various NCAA rules violations, and assistant coach Mike Hopkins led the Orange. The Hoyas took a 36–24 lead at the half, and started the second half with an 11–2 run to pull ahead 47–26. The Orange battled back, closing to a six-point deficit in the last minute of the game, but the Hoyas held on for a 79–72 upset victory, their fifth defeat of Syracuse in the last seven meetings between the schools, and their first win of the season over a ranked opponent. Bradley Hayes scored a career-high 21 points along with eight rebounds, while Isaac Copeland finished with 14 points, Marcus Derrickson finished with his first career double-double (13 points and 10 rebounds), and D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera added 11 points. For the first time in the 2015–2016 season, Georgetown had a winning record, at 4–3.\nThe Hoyas followed up their upset of Syracuse by stretching their winning streak to five with two more wins. They had an easy victory over Brown, in which Paul White had what turned out to be his best game of the season with four points and four rebounds, then made their second consecutive appearance in the annual BB&amp;T Classic and staved off a late-game 19–3 scoring run by UNC Wilmington to deal the Seahawks their first loss of the season. Georgetown′s record improved to 6–3, but two surprising losses ensued to close the homestand. First, Monmouth shocked Georgetown in a 15-point upset, shooting 50 percent from three-point range, outrebounding the Hoyas, and never trailing after conceding the opening basket to Georgetown; it was the first time Monmouth had ever beaten a Big East opponent. Four days later, UNC Asheville upset Georgetown for its fifth straight win. D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera scored 12 points against Brown, 29 against UNC Wilmington, and 18 against Monmouth, and Bradley Hayes had double-doubles against Brown (12 points and 11 rebounds) and UNC Asheville (11 points and a career-high 18 rebounds), also recording six assists in the UNC Asheville game and grabbing 11 rebounds in the loss to Monmouth. L. J. Peak finished with 13 points in the Brown game and 10 against UNC Asheville. while Isaac Copeland scored 16 against Monmouth, 12 against UNC Asheville, and 10 in the UNC Wilmington game. Marcus Derrickson scored 15 points against UNC Wilmington, Kaleb Johnson scored a career-high 16 points against UNC Asheville, and Jesse Govan had 14 in the Monmouth game.\nThe Hoyas completed their non-conference schedule with a visit to Charlotte, and held on to beat the 49ers in a close game, with Isaac Copeland scoring 12 points, D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera adding 11, and L. J. Peak, Reggie Cameron, and Marcus Derrickson contributing 10 each. Paul White reaggravated his hip injury during the game, and it turned out to be his last one as a Hoya, as he soon underwent a season-ending abdominal procedure to treat the injury.\nThe Hoyas entered Big East Conference play with a record of 7–5, two of the losses coming against Top Five teams but the other three in surprising upsets by mid-major opponents. The Hoyas had one win against a ranked team – then-No. 14 Syracuse – to their credit, but when John Thompson III talked to the press about the team′s readiness for the Big East season after the Charlotte game, he said, \"Our defense is not close to where it needs to be for us to have success against the toughest basketball conference in the country.\"\nConference schedule.\nOn December 30, 2015, the Hoyas opened the Big East season – one of four teams to play on the conference′s opening day – by visiting DePaul, and they defeated the Blue Demons for the 17th time in their past 18 meetings, with D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera and Isaac Copeland scoring 15 points each and L. J. Peak adding 14. A home win against Marquette followed in the first game of 2016, Marcus Derrickson scoring 16 points against the Golden Eagles and Smith-Rivera contributing 15 points and six assists, while Isaac Copeland added 11 and Jesse Govan and L. J. Peak both came off the bench to score in double figures, Govan contributing 11 and Peak 10. They lost their first conference game of the season in a visit to Creighton, going 3-for-7 in free throws while the Bluejays went 21-of-25 from the line but they returned to the Verizon Center to beat DePaul for the 18th time in the past 19 meetings and then won a game at Madison Square Garden against St. John's, whose new coach, Chris Mullin, had been a star player for St. John′s in the heyday of the rivalry between the two schools between 1981 and 1985. It was the eighth straight loss for the Red Storm, the longest losing streak in the 109-year history of the school′s men′s basketball program, and the teams played before the smallest crowd for a game between Georgetown and St. John′s since 2007; Georgetown improved its record in the all-time series against St. John′s to 49–55. Smith-Rivera scored 17 points and had seven assists against Creighton, and scored 17 points in the second game against DePaul. Against St. John's, he equaled a career high with 33 points, the highest point total at that point in the season for a Big East player, on 11-for-16 shooting from the field overall and 5-for-8 from three-point range. L. J. Peak had 17 points in the second DePaul game, while Reggie Cameron scored a career-high 15 points against St. John′s. Off the bench, Jesse Govan scored 17 points and pulled down seven rebounds against Creighton and had 12 points in the second DePaul game, and Tre Campbell came into the St. John′s game to score 12. The Hoyas entered the St. John′s game shooting 74.5 percent from the free throw line and improved on that by shooting 27-of-33 (81.8 percent) from the line against the Red Storm.\nWinners of five of their last six games and with an overall record of 11–6 and a conference record of 4–1, the Hoyas returned to Washington to host No. 6 Villanova, winners of 20 straight Big East games since an upset loss to Georgetown at the Verizon Center on January 19, 2015, and Georgetown′s third Top Ten opponent of the season. Before the game, Georgetown held a moment of silence for former Butler center Andrew Smith, who had died of acute lymphoblastic leukemia four days earlier at the age of 26. Villanova led 26–22 at halftime. At one point in the second half, the Wildcats went without a field goal for 5:39, and they only scored one field goal during the final eight minutes of the game. but the Hoyas got in foul trouble and the Wildcats played tough inside defense and made nine of their last 10 free throws. D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera had 15 points in the game, Isaac Copeland added 11, and Reggie Cameron put in 10, but the Hoyas made a number of ball-handling mistakes and shot only 32.7 percent from the field for the game, and Villanova won 55–50.\nThree days later, Georgetown faced another major challenge, traveling to meet their third Top Five opponent of the season, No. 5 Xavier, which was undefeated at home and had a potent offense, averaging 80.1 points per game. The Musketeers pulled out to a 27–20 lead in the first half, but the Hoyas then switched to a zone defense, which slowed the Musketeers. Tre Campbell, meanwhile, scored 17 points in the half, and Georgetown held a 39–33 lead at halftime. In the second half, D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera scored 15 points on his way to a 20-point game, and the Hoyas pulled ahead for their first double-digit lead at 46–36. Xavier fought back, outscoring the Hoyas 13–5 to cut the Georgetown lead to 51–49, but then the Hoyas pulled away again to build an 11-point lead, and Xavier never got closer than six points the rest of the way. Georgetown won 81–72, dealing the Musketeers their first home-court loss of the season. Coming into the game, Xavier and Purdue were the only NCAA Division I teams that had not been outrebounded, but the Hoyas outrebounded the Musketeers 39–35. Xavier shot a season-low 35.8 percent from the floor. Campbell went 5-for-6 in three-pointers and scored a career-high 21 points, while L. J. Peak and Jesse Govan came off the bench to score 13 points each.\nGeorgetown next stepped away from conference play for one game to meet UConn at the Verizon Center. Both teams had been charter members of the original Big East and played each other annually throughout its 34 seasons from 1979 to 2013. When the conference broke up over the summer of 2013, UConn had remained in it as it reinvented itself as the American Athletic Conference, marketed as \"the American,\" while Georgetown left to become a charter member of the new Big East. As a result, the two teams had not met since February 2013, but they had agreed to renew the series by meeting each other in a home-and-home series, with the Hoyas visiting the Huskies this season and the Huskies returning the favor the following year. UConn shot 13-for-26 from the field in the first half, including 5-for-10 from three-point range, and the Huskies led 40–33 at halftime. UConn went cold as the second half began, starting the half shooting 1-for-16 (6.25 percent) from the field and allowing Georgetown to close the gap. By the time the Huskies sank their first field goal of the second half with 12:46 left to play, the Hoyas had cut their lead to 49–46. Georgetown then had an 8–2 scoring run that gave the Hoyas a 54–51 lead with 9:50 remaining. With six minutes left, Georgetown led 60–56, but the Hoyas managed only one more basket for the rest of the game. UConn, meanwhile, shot only 19.1 percent from the field during the second half, but made up for it by sinking free throws, going 20-for-25 from the line after halftime as part of a 29-for-36 effort for the game, while the Hoyas went 7-for-8 from the line for the entire game and only 2-for-3 in the second half. The Hoyas still led, 62–60, with 4:32 to play, but the barrage of Husky free throws took their toll. UConn redshirt junior shooting guard Rodney Purvis stole the ball from Jesse Govan and sank two free throws with 18 seconds left to help seal a 68–62 UConn victory. UConn shot 17-for-47 (36.2 percent) from the field overall, but outrebounded the Hoyas 35–34, scored 15 points off 12 Georgetown turnovers, and outscored the Hoyas 24–18 in the paint. The Hoyas made the largest number of three-point attempts that they had all season but went only 9-for-31 (29.0 percent) from beyond the arc. Reggie Cameron led the Hoyas with 13 points, and D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera and L. J. Peak scored 12 each.\nThe Hoyas returned to conference play with a come-from-behind victory over Creighton at the Verizon Center in which Smith-Rivera scored a game-high 19 points and Peak added 11. Then they hosted yet another Top Ten team, No. 10 Providence, whose roster included the Big East′s two top scorers, Ben Bentil and Kris Dunn. Both teams wore pink sneakers and uniforms that featured the color pink in a show of support for the Coaches vs. Cancer charity. During the first half, Bentil and Dunn scored 29 points while the entire Georgetown team scored only 28, giving the Friars a 38–28 halftime lead. Although Georgetown made several runs at Providence, the Friars managed to stave off the underdog Hoyas and won the game 73–69. L. J. Peak scored 19 points and D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera had 18, but Bentil and Dunn finished with 26 points each in a dominating performance, and during the game Dunn became the 48th player in Friar men's basketball history to score 1,000 points.\nThe loss to Providence began a three-game losing steak and marked the beginning of a steep downward spiral for the 2015-2016 Hoya team, which would win only two more games. The Hoyas began February with losses at Butler and at Seton Hall. They broke their losing streak with a victory against St. John′s, dealing the Red Storm their 15th straight loss, but it was Georgetown′s last win of the regular season. D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera scored 21 at Butler and 11 at Seton Hall; against St. John′s, he scored the team′s first eight points on the way to a game-high 24 points which moved him into sixth place all-time among Georgetown scorers, ahead of David Wingate (1,781 points), and also made him the first Hoya player ever to score over 1,000 points in conference games. Peak scored a season-high 22 points against Butler, and came off the bench for 17 points and eight rebounds against Seton Hall and to score 20 points against St. John′s, giving him double figures in seven straight games. Isaac Copeland, who had been mired in a slump in which he had scored only 11 points on 5-of-23 (21.7 percent) shooting from the field in his previous four games combined, scored 11 against Butler, then went on to a team-high 18 points against Seton Hall and a 23-point showing along with eight rebounds against St. John′s. Reggie Cameron scored 12 off the bench against St. John′s, and Bradley Hayes scored 12 against Butler.\nOn February 11, three days after the Hoyas beat St. John′s, Hayes broke his hand during practice. He underwent successful surgery for the injury on February 13, shortly before the Hoyas met Providence that day, but was lost for the rest of the regular season. At the time of the injury, he was averaging 8.5 points and 6.8 rebounds per game, and his 53.9 shooting percentage from the field was the team′s highest. Jesse Govan stepped in to take over at center, but without Hayes the Hoyas lost an important part of their inside game, forcing them to rely more heavily on Govan and Trey Mourning for perimeter shooting.\nGeorgetown′s rematch with Providence on the day of Hayes′s surgery took place at the Dunkin' Donuts Center in Providence. The Friars were still ranked, but had dropped to No. 20 in the AP Poll and had lost three straight games. The game saw the Big East′s top three scorers – Providence′s Ben Bentil (entering the game with 26.0 points per game) and Kris Dunn (17.0 per game) and Georgetown′s D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera (16.7 per game) – all on the court at the same time. In the first half, Georgetown shot only 9-for-28 (32.1 percent) from the field and forced only two Providence turnovers; during one stretch midway through the half, Georgetown did not score for seven minutes and turned the ball over five times while Providence scored 11 unanswered points to pull ahead by 20 points. The Hoyas fell behind by as many as 26 points in the first half, and trailed 49–29 at halftime. The Friars′s 49 first-half points were the most they had scored in the first half of a game all season, but the Hoyas chipped away at the Friars′ lead in the second half. Bentil, who scored 16 points, and Dunn, who finished with 20, again were key factors for Providence, combining to score 12 of the Friars′ final 14 points. Despite their efforts, D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera′s only basket of the game, a three-pointer, narrowed Providence′s lead to 70–67 with 2:42 left to play, and a three-pointer by Trey Mourning cut it to 71–70 with 1:08 remaining. Providence redshirt sophomore forward Rodney Bullock, who had a double-double with 23 points and 10 rebounds, hit two free throws to stretch the Friars′ lead to 73–70. Isaac Copeland, fouled on a three-point attempt, made two of his three free throws to bring Georgetown back within one point at 73–72 with 10 seconds left, then Bentil made two free throws to give the Friars a 75–72 lead. Bullock blocked L. J. Peak′s potentially game-tying three-pointer in the game′s closing seconds to preserve a 75–72 Friars victory. Five Hoyas scored in double figures: Marcus Derrickson led the Hoyas with 18 points and nine rebounds, Jesse Govan had 13 points, and Copeland finished with 12, while L. J. Peak came off the bench to score 13 and Trey Mourning had 10 off the bench.\nThe Hoyas returned to the Verizon Center for a three-game homestand that began with a loss to Seton Hall – Pirates head coach Kevin Willard′s 100th win at Seton Hall – despite seven rebounds and a career-high 27 points by Jesse Govan on 10-of-13 (76.9 percent) shooting from the field, including four three-pointers, and despite D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera and L. J. Peak also scoring in double figures, Smith-Rivera finishing with 18 points and Peak with 10. Next, the Hoyas hosted No. 8 Xavier, their eighth game against a ranked opponent of the season. Xavier jumped out to a double-digit lead during the first half, but the Hoyas battled back to shrink the Musketeers′ lead to 35–33 at halftime. Xavier opened the second half by scoring 13 consecutive points and making 12 of its first 13 shots from the field, and the Musketeers pulled out to a 21-point lead as the game wore on. Xavier shot 54 percent from the field for the game and 77 percent in the second half, and they outrebounded the Hoyas 33–30, giving them a 16–5 advantage in fast-break points. Georgetown had trouble with Xavier′s variant of a 1–3–1 defense, and the Hoyas made 27 of their 61 field goal attempts from three-point range, sinking only 10 of them for a 27 percent three-point-shooting effort. Xavier won 88–70, dealing the Hoyas their sixth loss in seven games and third in a row. Smith-Rivera led the Hoyas with 18 points, Isaac Copeland scored 13 points, and Peak came off the bench for 12. Tre Campbell, meanwhile, was mired in a slump; since scoring his career-high 21 points in the game at Xavier on January 19, he had made only six shots and scored only 18 points in nine games.\nThe Hoyas completed their last homestand of the year with an overtime loss to Butler, then began March and a final, two-game road-trip with a one-point loss at Marquette. Against Butler, D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera scored a team-high 26 points in the last home game of his career, while Isaac Copeland finished with 17, L. J. Peak came off the bench for 14, and Marcus Derrickson scored 11, while Jesse Govan grabbed 10 rebounds. In the Marquette game, Isaac Copeland scored a career-high 32 points and Smith-Rivera had 16 points, nine rebounds and eight assists, while Derrickson scored 15 and Peak contributed 12 off the bench. With only eight healthy players on the roster, John Thompson III turned to the team′s student manager, sophomore Ra'Mond Hines, adding him to the roster as a walk-on prior to the game at Marquette; a guard, Hines ultimately made only one appearance before the season ended, playing in the last seconds of the Big East tournament game against DePaul.\nThe struggling Hoyas finished their regular season with a visit to No. 3 Villanova, playing before a sellout crowd at the Wells Fargo Center. The Wildcats dominated the Hoyas, jumping out to a 21-point lead in the first half and leading 46–27 at halftime. L. J. Peak led the Hoyas with 31 points, Marcus Derrickson scored 14, and Isaac Copeland grabbed 13 rebounds, but the Hoyas shot only 4-for-26 (15.4 percent) from three-point range. and the Wildcats won 84–71. Villanova improved its record in the all-time series with Georgetown to 33–44, and Georgetown′s record against Top 25 teams during John Thompson III′s 12-year tenure fell to 45–52.\nThe Hoyas finished the regular season with an overall record of 14–17, the first regular-season losing record of John Thompson III's 12-year tenure as head coach and the first since the 2003-2004 season. Their conference record of 7–11 and eighth-place finish in the Big East were their worst final conference record since a 7–11 finish in the 2008–2009 season and lowest position in the final conference standings since an 11th-place finish in the original Big East in 2008–2009. They had lost six games in a row to finish the regular season – their longest losing streak since they lost the final nine games of the 2003–2004 season – as well as nine of their last 10, and 10 of their last 12. They had played seven games against ranked opponents and won only two of them. After the final loss to Villanova, John Thompson III told the press that 2015–2016 had been the most challenging season of his career \"By far. By far...Not close.\"\nBig East tournament.\nWith a No. 8 seed in the 2016 Big East tournament at Madison Square Garden, Georgetown faced ninth-seeded DePaul in the first round. Former Georgetown head coach John Thompson Jr., and former Georgetown great Patrick Ewing, both members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, attended the game, seated behind Georgetown′s bench. Bradley Hayes, who missed the last six games of the regular season with a broken hand, returned to play, and his presence bolstered the Hoyas′ defense. The Hoyas shot 50 percent (12-for-24) from the field during the first half, while the Blue Demons shot only 31 percent (9-for-29), and Georgetown finished the half with an 8–0 scoring run – almost 10–0, but the officials ruled that Kaleb Johnson′s layup at the buzzer was too late to count – that gave the Hoyas a 35–24 lead at halftime. In the second half, the Hoyas had a 16–2 scoring run – including 11 by D'Vauntes Smith Rivera, who scored 15 points after halftime – to pull 18 points ahead for the first time at 55–37 with 8:56 left in the game. Georgetown snapped its six-game losing streak and won 70–53, its first victory in nearly weeks, while DePaul lost its fourth game in a row, for the eighth time in its last nine Big East tournament games, and for the 19th time in the last 20 games against Georgetown. For the game, DePaul shot 37.9 percent (22-for-58) from the field, while the Hoyas shot 50 percent (23-for-46). Smith-Rivera – who entered the game fifth in scoring in the Big East with 16.3 points per game and was the only Big East player to be in the top ten in seven statistical categories – scored 20 points, Hayes had 10, and L. J. Peak came off the bench to add 10 points.\nIn the quarterfinals, about 15 hours after defeating DePaul, Georgetown faced the tournament′s top-seeded team and defending champion, No. 3 Villanova, which had received a bye in the first round. Villanova had beaten Georgetown in both regular-season games they played, and the Big East tournament game was their second meeting in five days. During the first half, the officials allowed the teams to play a physical game reminiscent of the original Big East in its 1980s heyday, and there were only eight fouls called and no free throws during the half. The Hoyas held Villanova to 40.7 percent shooting from the field overall in the first half, but during the half allowed the Wildcats to shoot 50 percent in three-pointers. With Georgetown leading 27–25, both teams had a scoring drought late in the first half that lasted nearly five minutes – including three minutes while D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera was on the bench after being poked in the eye – until Wildcat junior forward Kris Jenkins finally broke it by sinking a three-pointer with eight seconds left in the half to give Villanova a 28–27 halftime lead. Georgetown opened the second half with a 9–4 scoring run that gave the Hoyas a 37–31 lead. Halfway through the second half, Georgetown still led, 47–46, but the Wildcats then went on a decisive 14–1 scoring run. Villanova took the lead for good with just over 10 minutes left in the game, and led 60–48 with minutes to play. In contrast to the opening half, the second half saw 27 fouls called and 37 free throws. The Hoyas outrebounded the Wildcats 25–12 and had 16 offensive rebounds to the Wildcats′ four but scored only 12 second-chance points, while Villanova shot 13-for-21 (61.9 percent) from three-point range, scored 20 points off 11 Georgetown turnovers, and took all 25 of its free throws in the second half as the Wildcats began drawing fouls from the Hoyas. Villanova won 81–67, its first win against Georgetown in the Big East tournament, improving its all-time record against Georgetown in the Big East tournament to 1–5. L. J. Peak led the Hoyas with 18 points. In his last game for Georgetown, Smith-Rivera scored 8 points on 4-for-11 shooting, missing all four three-pointers he attempted, while Hayes finished with 13 points and nine rebounds. Villanova advanced to meet Providence in the semifinals and, despite losing the Big East tournament championship game to Seton Hall, went on to the 2016 NCAA tournament, and eventually won the national championship.\nWrap-up.\nWith a record of 15–18 and having lost seven of its last eight games and 10 of its last 12, Georgetown received no invitation to either the NCAA Tournament or the National Invitation Tournament for the first time since the 2003–2004 season and the first time in John Thompson III′s 12-season tenure as head coach. Although in the immediate aftermath of the loss to Villanova in the Big East tournament Thompson said that he was not sure if Georgetown would play in a third-tier postseason tournament such as the College Basketball Invitational, participation in such a tournament by a major-conference team was rare, and in the end he decided not to. The Hoyas′ season was over.\nD'Vauntes Smith-Rivera was the team′s leading scorer for the season; he started all 33 games, shooting 41.3 percent from the field overall and 33.0 percent in three-pointers, averaging a team-high 16.2 points and 3.6 rebounds per game. L. J. Peak played in all 33 games, starting 12 of them, and averaged 12.3 points and 3.3 rebounds per game, shooting 49.1 percent from the field overall and 40.9 percent from three-point range. Isaac Copeland started all 33 games, shooting 42.9 percent in field-goal attempts and 27.2 percent from three-point range, and he averaged 11.1 points and 5.4 rebounds per game. Bradley Hayes missed six games with a broken hand but started the other 27, and he was the team′s fourth-leading scorer, averaging 8.7 points per game on 54.1 percent field-goal shooting, and led the team with 6.7 rebounds per game; it was a breakout season for him after he had spent most his first three years on the bench, averaging a combined 3.2 points per game. Marcus Derrickson played in 32 games and stated 27 of them, and he finished the year averaging 7.1 points and 4.5 rebounds per game, shooting 40.7 percent from the field. Jesse Govan appeared in all 33 games and started the six that Hayes missed due to injury; Govan ended the season with a field-goal percentage of 48.0 overall and 50 percent in three-pointers, with per-game averages of 6.8 points and 4.1 rebounds. Reggie Cameron started six of the 32 games he played in, and he averaged 5.6 points per game on 40.1 percent shooting from the field – 35.6 percent from beyond the arc – and grabbed 2.0 rebounds per game. Tre Campbell averaged 4.1 points and 1.8 rebounds in the 30 games he played in, 20 of them starts, and shot 30.5 percent from the field overall and 27.0 percent from three-point range, while Kaleb Johnson started once in his 32 appearances, shooting 58.0 percent from the field overall and 53.8 percent in three-pointers, although he averaged only 2.8 points per game and pulled down an average of 1.7 rebounds per game. Trey Mourning came off the bench in 20 games; he shot 52.2 percent from the field but finished with only 1.5 points per game. Walk-on Riyan Williams played in 23 games off the bench, his high for a season during his Georgetown career, and averaged 0.3 point per game. Paul White struggled with a hip injury during the season, and he played in only seven games, all off the bench, before undergoing an abdominal procedure that ended his season; he averaged 1.6 points and 1.6 rebounds in those games.\nWhen D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera scrapped his plans to enter the NBA draft in the spring of 2016 and returned to play for Georgetown for a fourth season in 2015–2016, expectations for 2015–2016 had soared; what pundits and fans thought would be a rebuilding year with mediocre play in the wake of Smith-Rivera′s departure changed to anticipation of him leading the Hoyas in a return to the Top 25, a second-place finish in the Big East, and a second consecutive appearance in the NCAA Tournament. However, the team had an up-and-down early season and then collapsed in February and March, and the season fell far below expectations. The 2015–2016 Hoyas were a young team with a roster that included only one player – Smith-Rivera – who previously had played more than a season with significant minutes, and even Smith-Rivera, who finished as the team's leading scorer for the season, had a down year – at least by his standards – shooting his lowest field-goal, three-point, and free-throw percentages since his freshman season. The 2015–2016 squad suffered in particular from committing too many fouls and too many turnovers; they had the 345th-worst fouling rate among the 351 NCAA Division I teams, and they turned over the ball 19 percent of the time on offense, the 244th-worst rate in NCAA Division I. Georgetown finished the regular season third in the Big East in field-goal percentage defense at 41.1, but also had great difficulty in defending against three-pointers. Injuries also dogged the team: Akoy Agau missed the entire season with a knee injury, Paul White – the team′s leading scorer off the bench the previous year – missed all but seven games with a hip injury, and Bradley Hayes′s broken hand had forced him to miss six key games at the end of the regular season, all of which Georgetown lost. The Hoyas never made the Top 25 in either the Associated Press Poll or the Coaches Poll during the season – the first time that had happened since the 2013–2014 season and only the second time since the 2003–2004 season – and they finished in eighth place in the Big East, their first losing record in the conference since the 2008–2009 season and their worst conference finish since 2008–2009. They finished with an overall record of 15–18, their first losing season since the 2003–2004 season and only their third since the 1972–1973 season. They had no postseason play for the first time since the 2003–2004 season.\nD'Vauntes Smith-Rivera and Riyan Williams graduated after the season. Smith-Rivera completed his four years at Georgetown as the fifth-leading scorer in Georgetown men's basketball history with 1,919 points and the program′s all-time leader in three-point shots made, having hit 250 of the 691 three-pointers he attempted. He played in 130 games, starting 97 of them, shooting 42.3 percent from the field – 36.2 percent from three-point range – and averaging 14.8 points and 3.9 rebounds per game. He went undrafted in the 2016 National Basketball Association draft but played professionally in other leagues. Riyan Williams, a little-used three-season walk-on who had played in 32 games and scored eight points during his Georgetown career, had a year of college eligibility left after graduation, and he chose to transfer to NCAA Division II Goldey–Beacom College to play the following season. His father, Georgetown great Reggie Williams, would tell the press a year later that Riyan had been \"miserable\" at Georgetown.\nA surprise returnee for the following season was senior Bradley Hayes. He was due to graduate in 2016, and virtually everyone, including Hayes himself, believed as the 2015–2016 season came to an end that his college career was over. However, John Thompson III had secretly applied for an NCAA waiver that would allow Hayes to return for a fifth year as a redshirt senior in 2016–2017 because he had played in only nine games and for only 14 minutes during his freshman year and had a semester to go to complete his degree. The NCAA granted the waiver, provided that Hayes sat out the first four games of the 2016–2017 season. Thompson informed Hayes that he could return for a fifth year only ten minutes before Hayes was to give a farewell speech at the annual men's basketball banquet in late April 2016 and told Hayes to break the news of his return instead of saying farewell. Hayes did, to the delight and applause of the other attendees at the banquet.\nPaul White also received redshirt status after playing in only seven games in the 2015–2016 season due to his hip injury, but he did not stay at Georgetown. After he played in the Kenner League at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown University campus over the summer of 2016, Georgetown announced on August 18, 2016, that he was transferring after two seasons with the Hoyas. On August 31, 2016, he announced that he would transfer to Oregon, where under NCAA rules he would have to sit out the 2016–2017 season before beginning play with the Ducks in the 2017–2018 season. L. J. Peak, meanwhile, considered foregoing his last two years of college and entering the 2016 NBA draft, but John Thompson III and his staff talked Peak out of it, and Peak decided to return to Georgetown for his junior year.\nCriticism of John Thompson III′s performance as head coach reached a high level with the failure of the 2015–2016 team, with many fans calling for him to be fired and the campus newspaper \"The Hoya\" referring to him as \"one of the most polarizing figures in college sports.\" The Georgetown men's basketball program, a perennial national contender for many years, appeared to many observers to be in a steepening decline; the team′s fan base was eroding and attendance at Georgetown home games was dropping. Fox Sports 1, which had secured the contract to broadcast the new Big East Conference′s games when the new conference was formed in 2013, counted on Georgetown serving as the new conference′s flagship member and as a major factor in drawing viewers to the new Big East, as Georgetown had in the original Big East from 1979 to 2013. But the network found itself losing money on Big East broadcasts as viewer interest in the conference declined along with Georgetown′s performance on the court.\nAlthough Smith-Rivera′s graduation left the team with no obvious on-court leader for the following year, the surprise return of Bradley Hayes – who had emerged as an important part of Georgetown′s defense and inside game during his senior year – fed hopes that the Hoyas would return to contention in 2016–2017 rather than suffer through a rebuilding year. In reality, more disappointment lay ahead for the Georgetown men′s basketball team in what was to be another troubled season in 2016–2017, and it would be Thompson′s last as head coach.\nRoster.\nSenior guard Riyan Williams, the son of Reggie Williams, made the team as a walk-on for the third straight season, and sophomore forward Trey Mourning, the son of Alonzo Mourning, returned for his second season. They were the third and fourth sons, respectively, of a former player to play for Georgetown. Other than Mourning and Williams, only two sons of former players had played at Georgetown: Patrick Ewing Jr., who played for Georgetown during the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 seasons and was the son of Patrick Ewing, and Ed Hargaden Jr., who played during the 1957-1958, 1958-1959, and 1959-1960 seasons and was the son of Ed Hargaden, Georgetown′s first All-American and star of the 1932-1933, 1933-1934, and 1934-1935 teams.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#; color:white;\"| Italy Trip (Exhibition)\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#; color:white;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#; color:white;\"| Big East tournament"

        "title": "Ed Murphy (basketball, born 1956)",
        "text": "Edward Murphy (born January 14, 1956) is a retired American professional professional basketball player. During his playing career, Murphy was nicknamed Radar, \"Lucky Luke\", and \"Ed-la-Gâchette\", which in French means, “Ed-the-Trigger”. During his pro club career, Murphy won two European-wide third-tier level FIBA Korać Cup championships, in the 1981–82 and 1982–83 seasons. He also won the Belgian Basketball League championship in the 1979–80 season, three French Pro A League championships (1982–83, 1983–84, and 1984–85), three French Federation Cup titles (1981–82, 1982–83, and 1984–85), and two Swiss Cup titles (1985–86 and 1986–87). \nIn 2016, Murphy's number 8 jersey was retired by Limoges CSP. In 2020, he was named the French League's Best Foreign Player of the 20th Century. Murphy was inducted into the French Basketball Hall of Fame, in 2021.\nEarly life and high school career.\nEdward Murphy, more commonly known as Ed Murphy, was born in Bayonne, New Jersey. He started playing in organized school basketball competitions at a very young age, where he showed himself to be a young prodigy in the sport. At the age of 10, in a elementary school game, Murphy scored 68 points. \nHe later attended Marist High School. While at Marist High, the 6'4\" tall shooting guard-small forward played high school basketball. At Marist, he quickly proved himself as a player, after spending hours of training working on adjusting his jump shots and overall basketball technique. During his 1973–74 senior high school season, Murphy averaged 33 points per game.\nCollege career.\nIn 1974, Murphy decided to attend Merrimack College, where he played college basketball with the Merrimack Warriors, in the NCAA Division II, until 1978. In his 1974–75 college freshman season, Murphy, who was known for his long-distance shooting, averaged 15.0 points per game. In his 1975–76 college sophomore season, he averaged 23.0 points per game, and he was an NCAA II Second Team All-American selection. \nIn his 1976–77 college junior season, Murphy the NCAA II in scoring, with an average of 32.0 points per game. During that same season, he set the Merrimack single-season school records, for both per game scoring average, at 32.0, and for the most total points scored in a single season, with 896. He was an NCAA II First Team All-American selection for the 1976–77 season.\nIn his 1977–78 college senior season, Murphy averaged 31.3 points per game. He was also an NCAA II First Team All-American selection for the 1977–78 season. While at Merrimack, Murphy twice led the school to the NCAA Division II Sweet 16, in the 1976–77 and the 1977–78 seasons, where they lost both times to the Sacred Heart Pioneers. Murphy's career single-game scoring high with Merrimack was 48 points. He finished his college career as Merrimack's all-time leading scorer, in both points per game average, at 26.4, and in total points scored, with 2,874.\nProfessional career.\nMurphy was selected by the Atlanta Hawks, in the 8th round of the 1978 NBA draft, with the 160th overall draft pick. Since Murphy played at a small college basketball program, in the NCAA's Second Division, the Atlanta Hawks' management were only willing to offer him a non-guaranteed contract. Murphy decided to reject the Hawks' non-guaranteed contract offer. As a result, Murphy never played in the NBA, and instead decided to play professional club basketball in Europe. In September 1982, Murphy told the French basketball magazine , \"It is too hard to hold on. So in the fall of '78, I decided to find a job. I worked for two months in the United Parcel Service, and in November, I got a call from Glinder Torain, who placed American players in Europe. I decided to come try my luck in the Netherlands\".\nBOB Oud-Beijerland (1978–1979).\nAt the age of 23, Murphy began his pro club career in the Netherlands, with the Dutch Basketball League club BOB Oud-Beijerland, where he played during the 1978–79 season. He signed a contract with BOB Oud-Beijerland in November 1978.&lt;ref name=\"Basketbaljaarbook 78/79\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His contract in the Netherlands was the result of advice that was given to the club by the sports agent Glinder Torain, and also due to the scouting of the team's player-coach, Charis Sideris. In his first Dutch League game, on 25 November 1978, Murphy made a sensational debut against the league's then defending champions, EBBC Den Bosch, as he scored 41 points in the game, despite his team losing the game by a sore of 90–109. \nMurphy's performance provoked the ire of EBBC Den Bosch's head coach, Ton Boot. In a Dutch League game against Radio Muzette Rotterdam-Zuid, Murphy had another outstanding game, as he scored 49 points in the encounter. As a result of such performances, Murphy was selected to the Dutch League All-Star Game, in which he scored 30 points. His team's coach, Charis Sideris, would years later state that, \"I remember how Wim Benschop and I had followed his successful campaign. We watched him play, with an excited look and a smile. The class\". With a scoring average of 35.8 points per contest, Murphy was the leading scorer of the Dutch League, in the 1978–79 season. His club, BOB Oud-Beijerland, finished the season in fifth place in the league, with a losing record of 15–21, and thus failed to make the league's playoffs.\nR.C. Mechelen (1979–1981).\nAfter spending a season in the Netherlands, playing in the Dutch Basketball League, Murphy joined the Belgian Basketball League club R.C. Mechelen. In his first season with the club (1979–80), Murphy won Belgian League's championship. He also finished the season as the top scorer of the league, with a scoring average of 30.5 points per game. \nBecause R.C. Mechelen won the Belgian national league's championship, they thus qualified for the next season's edition of the FIBA European Champions' Cup (now known as the EuroLeague), which is the top-tier level pro club basketball competition in Europe. In the FIBA European Champions' Cup's 1980–81 season, Murphy averaged 17.0 points per game, and his team, R.C. Mechelen, was eliminated in the league's group stage. In the Belgian League, Murphy suffered an injury before the league's finals, and his team was then eliminated in the league's finals by Oostende. \nDuring the Belgian League's 1980–81 season, Murphy averaged 29.8 points per game. Over his two seasons played in the Belgian League (1979–80 and 1980–81), Murphy was the league's leading scorer over that time span, with 1,108 total points scored. Murphy would later state this about his experience in Belgium, \"I had good friends in Belgium, and the team worked fine. We won the title in '80, and lost in the finals, the following year.\"\nLimoges CSP (1981–1985).\nMurphy joined the French Basketball League club Limoges CSP, in 1981. Limoges' head coach at the time, André Buffière, had insisted on signing him. With Limoges, Murphy quickly silenced his critics, who had previously said that he was too unathletic and too slow for the French League. A pure shooter, Murphy would eventually become one of the best players in the history of the French League. \nIn the 1981–82 season, which was Murphy's first season with Limoges CSP, he scored an average of 29.8 points per game in the French League. He increased his scoring average in the French League, in each year that he spent with the club. He averaged 31.7 points per game in the French League's 1982–83 season, 32.3 points per game in the French League's 1983–84 season, and 34.1 points per game in the French League's 1984–85 season.\nMurphy was the French League's Best Scorer in four straight seasons (1981–82, 1982–83, 1983–84, and 1984–85). He was also named the French League's Foreign Player's MVP of the 1982–83, 1983–84, and 1984–85 seasons. During his time with the club, Murphy helped Limoges win three French national league championship titles (1982–83, 1983–84, and 1984–85), three French Federation Cup titles, (1981–82, 1982–83, and 1984–85), and two European-wide third-tier level FIBA Korać Cup titles (1981–82 and 1982–83). \nIn the European third-tier FIBA Korać Cup's 1981–82 season, Murphy averaged 29.3 points per game. He also led his team to the league's championship. In the 1982 Korać Cup Final, Limoges defeated the Yugoslav League club Šibenka, and it's legendary star player, Dražen Petrović, by a score of 90 to 84. Murphy was the FIBA Korać Cup Finals Top Scorer, with 35 points scored. \nIn the following FIBA Korać Cup 1982–83 season, Murphy averaged 28.6 points per game. He also again led his team to the league's championship. In the 1983 Korać Cup Final, Limoges once again defeated Šibenka, which was still led by Dražen Petrović, by a score of 94 to 86. Murphy was also once again the FIBA Korać Cup Finals Top Scorer, with 34 points scored. \nIn Europe's top-tier level competition, the FIBA European Champions' Cup (EuroLeague), Murphy averaged 33.0 points per game in the 1983–84 season. In the FIBA European Champions' Cup's 1984–85 season, Murphy averaged 30.5 points per game. On 17 November 1984, during his last season with Limoges (1984–85), Murphy scored 53 points, in a French League game against ES Avignon.\nWhen reflecting on how his Limoges stint ended, at the conclusion of the 1984–85 season, Murphy said years later, \"We had like a verbal agreement of a two-year contract, with Limoges, for two more years. But I couldn’t play, my Achilles… I never missed a game in four years. I was in pain, and I was getting treatment. I hadn't been practicing or anything, and they said I had to go, and I didn’t play in a game. And then Xavier Popelier (Limoges CSP's Chairman at the time), came in and told me I was no more on the team. So that is how my career ended in Limoges. (...) Back then, if you were an American, they would just change the American.\"\nOver 30 years after he last played with Limoges, Murphy stated the following about his days spent with the club during home games, \"I never played in a more exciting place. I never played in front of a public that vocal, that loud.\" In September 2016, over 30 years after having last played for the club, Murphy had his number 8 jersey retired by Limoges CSP. In 2020, he was named the French League's Best Foreign Player of the 20th Century. He was inducted into the French Basketball Hall of Fame, in 2021.\nChampel de Genève 1985–1988.\nMurphy continued his playing career with Champel de Genève of the Swiss Basketball League, after having parted ways with Limoges CSP, in 1985. Looking back on how he came to Switzerland, Murphy later said, \"I was supposed to go to Naples, and it didn’t work out, and I had no job. I was home with no job, and I went up to Geneva. They had an international school. I loved it there. I just didn’t have a job, and they were the first ones to offer me a job; and then they offered me a good contract to stay, and I stayed.\" \nIn the 1985–86 season, Murphy averaged 40.1 points per game in the Swiss League. During that 1985–86 season, he scored 49 points in a Swiss League game against Viagenello. He was named the Swiss League's Foreign Player's MVP that season.\nMurphy suffered a serious injury, acute phlebitis of the scapula, and because of that, he only played in a total of two Swiss national domestic league games, and one game in the European-wide second-tier level FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup for the team, in the 1986–87 campaign. He averaged 20.0 points per game in the Swiss League, in those two games played, and also 20.0 points per game in the one FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup game that he played in.\nIn the 1987–88 season, Murphy scored an average of 39.9 points a contest in the Swiss League for Geneva. During that same season in the Swiss League, he had a single-game season-high of 54 points, a total of four games in which he scored 50 points or more, and another 15 games in which he scored 40-plus points. Murphy also averaged 38.5 points per game in the European secondary level FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup's 1987–88 campaign.\nNyon 1988–1990.\nMurphy moved to the Swiss Basketball League club BBC Nyon, for the 1988–89 season. During that 1988–89 season, he averaged 36.8 points per game in the Swiss League, and 22.5 points per game in the European-wide third-tier level FIBA Korać Cup's 1988–89 season. In that season's Swiss League, he had six 40+ point games, and single-game season highs of 54 points against Chêne Basket Geneve, on 16 November 1988, and 55 points against SF Lausanne Basket, on 19 November 1988.\nIn the following 1989–90 season, Murphy averaged 32.1 points per game in the Swiss League, and 28.0 points per game in the European third level FIBA Korać Cup's 1989–90 season. In that season's Swiss League, he had another six 40+ point games, and single-game season highs of 49 points against SF Lausanne Basket, on 21 October 1989, and 49 points against Pully, on 17 February 1990. In 1990, after finishing the 1989–90 season with Nyon, Murphy retired from playing professional club basketball, at the age of 34."

He played college basketball for the University of Oklahoma and North Carolina Central University before playing professionally in Israel, Finland, Australia and Sweden.\nHigh school career.\nFor the first three years of his high school career, Willis attended Dr. Phillips High School in Orlando, Florida, where he averaged 18 points and eight rebounds per game as a junior in 2006–07 while earning first-team All-Metro Conference and second-team All-Central Florida honors.\nDuring the summer of 2007, Willis transferred to Westlake High School in Atlanta, Georgia, and later signed a National Letter of Intent to play college basketball for the University of Oklahoma in November 2007.\nAs a senior in 2007–08 playing for Westlake, Willis averaged 27.5 points, seven rebounds and five assists per game.

        "title": "2015 FIFA Women's World Cup final",
        "text": "The 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup final was a women's soccer match that took place on 5 July 2015 at BC Place, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, to determine the winner of the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup. It was played between Japan and the United States, in a rematch of the 2011 final. The stakes were high for both sides: if the United States won the match, it would be the only country to have won in three Women's World Cup finals; if Japan had won instead, then it would be the first team, men's or women's, to win twice under the same coach (Norio Sasaki for Japan) since Vittorio Pozzo led Italy to victory in the 1934 World Cup and the 1938 World Cup. Ultimately, the United States won 5–2, winning its first title in 16 years and becoming the first team to win three Women's World Cup finals.\nBecause of the expanded competition format, it was the first time the finalists had played a seventh game in the tournament. The United States had previously reached the final game three times, winning twice (in 1991 and 1999) and placing as runners up in 2011. This was Japan's second successive final appearance and was their attempt to be the first country to successfully defend a title since Germany in the 2007 World Cup. Both teams were undefeated throughout the tournament, with the United States only conceding one goal in the six matches leading up to the final and Japan winning all of their matches in regular time.\nBackground.\nBefore this tournament, the two finalists had met each other three times in World Cup play. The United States beat Japan 3–0 in the group stage in 1991 and won 4–0 in a 1995 quarter-final match, while Japan bettered the United States 3–1 in a penalty shoot-out in the 2011 World Cup final after the match was tied 2–2 after extra time. The United States won the final 2–1 in the gold medal match at the 2012 Summer Olympics. The last meeting between the two teams was at the 2014 Algarve Cup, which ended in 0–0 draw, after the previous Algarve Cup between the two teams was won by Japan 1–0. Both the United States and Japan began the 2015 Women's World Cup as favorites to win the tournament. The United States was ranked second in the FIFA Women's World Rankings, while Japan was ranked fourth.\nThe United States entered the 2015 final as two-time world champions, having won the first and third edition of the Women's World Cup. The United States beat Norway 2–1 in the final, with two goals from Michelle Akers. In the 1999 final, host nation United States and China played to a goalless draw. After extra time, the United States won the match with a 5–4 penalties victory.\nThe 2015 final was Japan's second consecutive time contesting a World Cup final. Their first win was at the expense of the United States in the 2011 Women's World Cup, held in Germany. It was also the third consecutive time that a major women's football tournament final featured Japan and the United States, after the 2011 World Cup and 2012 Olympics. This was also the first rematch of a previous Women's World Cup final.\nOn 30 June 2015, FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced that he would not travel to Vancouver to attend the final, leaving vice-president Issa Hayatou to present the trophy at the final to the champion.\nRoute to the final.\nThe United States reached the final undefeated and only conceded one goal in the six matches leading up to the final. The squad was drawn into Group D of the Women's World Cup, along with Australia, Sweden and Nigeria. The United States' first match against Australia was played at Winnipeg Stadium. After Megan Rapinoe scored an early goal, Australia managed to equalize. Two goals in the second half saw the United States take all three points in their first match. The United States played their second match against Sweden in Winnipeg. After a goalless 90 minutes, both teams walked away with a point apiece. In their final group match, the United States played Nigeria at a sold out BC Place. A single goal from captain Abby Wambach in the 45th minute was enough for the United States to progress to the round of 16 stage as group winners to face Group F third-placed team Colombia. A 53rd-minute goal by Alex Morgan and penalty converted by Carli Lloyd in the 66th minute saw the end the game 2–0. In the quarter-final, the United States took on China in Lansdowne Stadium. A goal by Carli Lloyd saw the game end 1–0. The United States were matched up against number one ranked Germany in the semi-finals. Goals by Carli Lloyd and Kelley O'Hara in the Olympic Stadium ended the match 2–0, with the United States progressing to the 2015 final.\nJapan reached the final undefeated and conceded only three goals. They were drawn into Group C along with Switzerland, Cameroon and Ecuador. Japan's World Cup run started in the opening match of the tournament against Switzerland in Vancouver. A 29th-minute penalty from captain Aya Miyama secured all three points for Japan. In their second match, Japan played Cameroon. Goals from Aya Sameshima and Yuika Sugasawa gave Japan a 2–1 win. Japan's final group stage match was against Ecuador in Winnipeg ended in 1–0, thanks to a fifth-minute goal by Yūki Ōgimi. After winning their group, Japan next faced Group A third-placed team Netherlands in the round of 16. Goals at either side of the break, by Saori Ariyoshi and Mizuho Sakaguchi, saw the match end 2–1. In the quarter-finals, Japan faced 2014 AFC Women's Asian Cup Final opponents Australia in Commonwealth Stadium. An 87th-minute goal by Mana Iwabuchi was enough to ensure Japan reached the next round. In the semi-finals, Japan faced England in Edmonton. Two penalties in the first half and an own goal by Laura Bassett in the 92nd minute ended the match at 2–1 to send Japan into their second consecutive World Cup final.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe match was played under hazy conditions due to nearby wildfires and winds that carried the smoke towards the Lower Mainland region. The United States struck early, scoring four goals in the first 16 minutes. Three of those goals were scored by midfielder Carli Lloyd, giving her the fastest hat-trick in World Cup history. Lloyd's first goal at the 3rd minute was the fastest in a Women's World Cup final, as she drove in a corner kick from Megan Rapinoe. Her goal also marked the first time Japan had trailed throughout the tournament. Lloyd again scored in the 5th minute off of a free kick from Lauren Holiday. Holiday scored in the 14th minute after Japan defender Azusa Iwashimizu failed to clear the ball on a header and turned over possession. Lloyd's goal in the 16th minute, which Reuters called \"one of the most remarkable goals ever witnessed in a Women's World Cup\", was struck from the halfway line, catching Japan goalkeeper Ayumi Kaihori out of position. The stunning goal was nominated for the FIFA Puskás Award and meant Lloyd became the first woman to score a hat-trick in a World Cup Final and the first player, male or female, to do so since Geoff Hurst did so for England against West Germany in 1966 at Wembley. Only one player has done so since: Kylian Mbappé for France against Argentina in 2022 in Lusail, Qatar. Lloyd's hat-trick is the only one of the three to have been completed in regular time; two of Hurst's goals and one of Mbappé's were in extra time. \nStriker Yūki Ōgimi scored with a left-footed shot to give Japan's first goal in the 27th minute, outmaneuvering United States defender Julie Johnston. Japan coach Norio Sasaki then responded tactically by introducing two first half substitutes, introducing midfielder Homare Sawa on for Iwashimizu and replacing winger Nahomi Kawasumi for striker Yuika Sugasawa. An own goal off the head of Johnston from an Aya Miyama free kick added to Japan's scoreline in the second half, at the 52nd minute. Midfielder Tobin Heath scored the final goal of the game off of a pass from Morgan Brian for the United States two minutes later. The combined seven goals were the most in Women's World Cup final history and tied the record for most goals in any men's or women's World Cup Final since Brazil defeated Sweden 5–2 in Solna in 1958.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Line-ups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Line-ups /&gt;\nMatch rules:\nOutcome.\nThe final broke multiple records. The goals by Carli Lloyd in the 3rd, 5th and 16th minutes made her the first player to score a hat trick in a Women's World Cup's Final, second in either men's or women's final and the fastest from kickoff in either men's or women's World Cup tournament. Yūki Ōgimi's goal in the twenty-seventh minute ended a United States streak at 540 minutes of not conceding a goal, tying a World Cup record of Germany in 2007. Homare Sawa, a member of the Japanese 2011 winning team, was introduced in the first half of the game. Christie Rampone, the only player remaining from the United States 1999 winning team, and Abby Wambach came on as subs late in the game. This is expected to have been the final World Cup appearance for all three. Rampone also became the oldest player to play in a Women's World Cup match, at the age of 40 years.\nIt also marked the first time since 1999 the United States held two major trophies in women's football (the Olympics medal and the World Cup). The United States also overtook Germany as the highest-scoring team in women's World Cup history.\nThe 5–2 scoreline set a record for the highest number of goals scored in a Women's World Cup final, and equaled the score of a match played between the United States and Japan at the 1988 FIFA Women's Invitation Tournament.\nOn U.S. television, the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup shattered viewing records for soccer – played by men or women. With the Fox Network reporting 25.4 million viewers and Spanish-language Telemundo reporting 1.3 million viewers, the combined 26.7 million viewers made the final the most-watched soccer game in American history.\nAs prize money for their victory, the US team was awarded $2 million. This paled in comparison to the 2014 men's champion, Germany, who received $35 million.\nOn 11 July, the World Cup win was celebrated with ticker-tape parade in New York City. It was the first time a team of female athletes were honored with a ticker-tape parade in the Canyon of Heroes in Lower Manhattan, and the first ticker-tape parade in New York City to honor female athletes since Olympic Athletes in 1984. At the parade, Mayor Bill de Blasio handed the team keys to the city at a ceremony at City Hall."

The first men's event was held in 1995 and a women's tournament started in 2007. The two tournaments have been played simultaneously or back-to-back since 2013. \nThe Argentine national team won the first three championships without losing a game, and subsequently the country was represented by a development squad, Argentina A, between 2000 and 2018. Guyana, the only Test-playing country in South America (as part of the West Indies cricket team), had sent a team four times, winning twice, but this has generally been a \"masters\" team consisting of past players. Colombia were going to send a team to the 2000 tournament, but in fact did not debut until 2015. The non-South American teams invited to the tournament have been Panama (in 2000), Puerto Rico (in 2004), Costa Rica (in 2018) and Mexico (since 2014). The thirteenth edition of the tournament was held in Itaguaí, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, in October 2016. Chile won the men's tournament and Brazil won the women's tournament.\nThe 2018 Championships were awarded to Colombia for the first time, and took place over 4 days in August with Mexico emerging as champions for the second time. Mexico won the men's event for the second time in 2018, and Argentina won again in 2019.\nArgentina also dominated the women's event by winning on seven occasions. From 2018, all women's matches between ICC member nations would be eligible for Twenty20 International (T20I) status after the ICC decided to grant T20I status to all matches involving its members from 1 January 2019. Brazil's women won the first edition with this enhanced status. Starting from the 2019 edition, the same status would apply to the men's event. The only non-ICC playing nations in 2019 were Colombia and Uruguay."

        "text": "The 2016 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 2015–16 season, and the culmination of the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Eastern Conference champion Pittsburgh Penguins defeated the Western Conference champion San Jose Sharks four games to two to win their fourth championship in franchise history. Penguins captain Sidney Crosby was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs.\nThe Penguins finished with more points than the Sharks during the regular season, giving them home ice advantage in the series. The series began on May 30 and concluded on June 12. This was the first Finals since 2007 to feature a team making their Finals debut. This was the first playoff meeting between teams from Pittsburgh and the Bay Area since the Penguins swept the Oakland Seals in the 1970 Stanley Cup Quarterfinals.\nThe Eastern Conference had home-ice advantage in consecutive seasons for the first time since the 2004 and 2006 Finals (the 2004–05 season, and consequently the 2005 Finals, were not played due to a lockout).\nFor the first time since 2006, a new scheduling format was instituted for the Finals. In previous years, the Finals were played on a Wednesday–Saturday-Monday scheme (with a few games being played on Friday). However, the league changed its scheduling to ensure an extra day off for both teams. The extra off day, along with the designated travel day, took place after games 2, 4, 5, and 6 in subsequent finals. This scheduling change was necessary as a result of the National Basketball Association (NBA) instituting a new scheduling format for its championship series that went into effect beginning in 2016.\nPaths to the Finals.\nPittsburgh Penguins.\nThis was Pittsburgh's fifth Finals appearance, and first since winning the Cup in . The Penguins had made the playoffs every year since their win in 2009, but hadn't won a single game in the conference finals in that span.\nAfter losing to the Rangers in the playoffs for the second consecutive year, the Penguins made waves during the 2015 offseason, trading for forwards Phil Kessel and Nick Bonino, re-signing defenceman Olli Maatta and forward Bryan Rust, and signing centres Matt Cullen and Eric Fehr in free agency. General manager Jim Rutherford fired head coach Mike Johnston on December 12, 2015, after the team limped to a 15–10–3 start. Johnston was replaced with Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins coach Mike Sullivan, who went 33–16–5 over the remainder of the season. The Penguins made three major trades before the trade deadline, acquiring defencemen Trevor Daley and Justin Schultz and forward Carl Hagelin. After goalie Marc-Andre Fleury suffered a concussion on April 2, the team turned to rookie Matt Murray for the final week of the regular season and the majority of the playoffs.\nPittsburgh finished with 104 points (48–26–8) in the regular season to finish second in the Metropolitan Division. Centre and team captain Sidney Crosby led the club in scoring during the regular season and finished third in the league with 85 points.\nIn the playoffs, the Penguins eliminated the New York Rangers in five games after losing to them in 2014 and 2015, the Presidents' Trophy-winning Washington Capitals in six games, and the defending conference champion Tampa Bay Lightning in seven games.\nSan Jose Sharks.\nThis was San Jose's first Finals appearance in their 25-year history, becoming the first team to make their Finals debut since the 2006–07 Ottawa Senators.\nDuring the offseason the Sharks hired former New Jersey Devils head coach Peter DeBoer to replace Todd McLellan and traded for former Kings backup goalie Martin Jones. San Jose also picked up defenceman Paul Martin and right wingers Joel Ward and Dainius Zubrus via free agency. Before the trade deadline, the Sharks acquired forward Nick Spaling, defenceman Roman Polak, and goalie James Reimer.\nSan Jose earned 98 points (46–30–6) to finish third in the Pacific Division. Centre Joe Thornton led the club in scoring with 82 points, and finished tied for fourth in the league, followed closely by centre and team captain Joe Pavelski with 78 points and defenceman Brent Burns with 75 points.\nIn the playoffs, San Jose avenged their 2014 loss to the Kings, a series in which they blew a 3–0 series lead, by defeating Los Angeles in five games. San Jose also eliminated the Nashville Predators in seven games, winning every home game in the series, and the St. Louis Blues in the Conference Final in six games.\nGame summaries.\n\" Number in parentheses represents the player's total goals or assists to that point of the entire four rounds of the playoffs\"\nGame one.\nGame one remained scoreless until Bryan Rust and Conor Sheary scored a minute apart for the Penguins midway through the first period. San Jose came back in the second period with a power play goal by Tomas Hertl at 3:02 and the tying goal by Patrick Marleau at 18:12. Despite 18 third-period Pittsburgh shots directed towards Martin Jones, the score remained tied at two until very late in the game, when Kris Letang found Nick Bonino wide open in front of the net to give the Penguins the lead. The Penguins held off the Sharks in the final minutes to win 3–2.\nGame two.\nGame two began with a scoreless first period which featured 11 Penguins shots and only six from the Sharks. Midway through the second period, a series of San Jose miscues led to a Pittsburgh goal. After Roman Polak nearly gave the puck away to Phil Kessel, Brenden Dillon was stripped by Carl Hagelin, who gave it to Nick Bonino for a tip-in by Kessel. The Sharks tied the game late in the third on a goal by Justin Braun, which sent the game into overtime. Early in overtime, a quick shot by Conor Sheary beat Martin Jones to give the Penguins a 2–1 win and 2–0 series lead.\nGame three.\nBen Lovejoy started off the scoring in game three at 5:29 of the first period, when his point shot deflected in off Roman Polak. The Sharks tied it at 9:34 on a Justin Braun goal. Midway through the second period, the Penguins took the lead back when Patric Hornqvist tipped in another Lovejoy point shot. In the third period, Nick Bonino high-sticked Joe Thornton, and in the dying seconds of the four-minute power play, Joel Ward fired a slap shot past Matt Murray to tie the game. In overtime, Joonas Donskoi roofed a tough-angle shot over Murray's shoulder for the game winner.\nGame four.\nAt 7:36 of the first period, Phil Kessel took advantage of a poor Sharks line change and fired a shot that rebounded off Martin Jones and directly to Ian Cole, who scored his first playoff goal. This marked the seventh consecutive game in which the Penguins had scored first. In the second period, Sharks forward Melker Karlsson was called for interference against Eric Fehr, and on the ensuing power play, Evgeni Malkin tipped in a Kessel shot for the Penguins' second goal. During the third period, Karlsson scored to cut the deficit to one, but the Penguins regained a two-goal lead with 2:02 left when Eric Fehr beat Jones on a breakaway.\nGame five.\nGame five started with four goals scored in the first 5:06 of the game. Brent Burns gave the Sharks their first lead of the Finals at 1:04, slipping it past Murray on the right post. San Jose scored again at 2:53, when Logan Couture deflected in a shot from Justin Braun. Less than two minutes later, Sharks forward Dainius Zubrus got called for delay of game after shooting the puck over the glass. On the ensuing power play, a Malkin shot deflected off Braun's skate and past Jones, cutting the deficit to 2–1. Less than a minute later, Brenden Dillon gave away the puck to Nick Bonino, who took a shot that was deflected in by Carl Hagelin. Later in the first period, during a Pittsburgh power play, a Phil Kessel wrist shot bounced off both posts but stayed out. Later in the period, Dillon passed down low for Couture who sauced a backhand pass to Karlsson, who scored to regain the lead for the Sharks. San Jose took just 15 shots in the second and third period combined, but Jones withstood a massive 46 shots from the Penguins to stave off elimination. Joe Pavelski provided an empty-net goal to force a sixth game.\nGame six.\nA power play drive from Brian Dumoulin started the scoring early in game six. During the first intermission, a tribute to Gordie Howe was played, as he died on June 10. San Jose tied it up in the second period when Logan Couture took a pass from Melker Karlsson and fired a shot past Murray. Just over a minute later, Pittsburgh regained the lead when a shot by Kris Letang ricocheted off Martin Jones and in. Despite facing elimination on home ice, the Sharks managed only two shots on goal in the third period, and an empty-net goal from Patric Hornqvist sealed the win for Pittsburgh. The Penguins won the fourth Stanley Cup in franchise history, clinching all four on the road.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 2016 Stanley Cup was presented to Penguins captain Sidney Crosby by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman following the Penguins' 3–1 win over the Sharks in Game 6.\nThe following Penguins players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n2015–16 Pittsburgh Penguins\nEngraving notes.\nPittsburgh broke the 1938 Chicago Black Hawks' record of eight with ten U.S.-born players on a Stanley Cup winning team: Nick Bonino, Ian Cole, Matt Cullen, Brian Dumoulin, Phil Kessel, Ben Lovejoy, Kevin Porter, Bryan Rust, Conor Sheary, and Jeff Zatkoff. An 11th American, Beau Bennett was not included on the cup.\nAll players listed above received Stanley Cup rings.\nGilles Meloche was the goaltending coach for Pittsburgh's Cup wins in 1991, 1992, and 2009. His role was changed to Special Assignment Scout, so his name was left off the Stanley Cup in 2016. However, he was awarded his fourth Stanley Cup ring. Other scouts left off the Cup but got rings were pro scouts Al Santili and Ryan Bowness, amateur scouts Colin Alexander, Scott Bell, Brain Fitzgerald, Luc Gauthier, Frank Golden, Jay Heinbuck, Wayne Meier, Ron Pyette, Casey Torres, and Warren Young, and European scouts Patrick Alivin, Petri Pakaslahi, and Tommy Westlund. Many other members of Pittsburgh's staff were also left off the Cup but still received championship rings.\nTelevision and radio.\nIn the U.S., the Final was split between NBC and NBCSN. NBCSN aired two games of the series while NBC aired the other five (if necessary). On May 27, NBC Sports announced that if the series was tied at 1–1 entering game three, then it would have aired on NBC and game four televised on NBCSN. However, if one team led 2–0 (as this eventually happened; Pittsburgh led 2-0), game three moved to NBCSN and then game four on NBC. The games were broadcast nationally on radio via the NBC Sports Radio network.\nIn Canada, the series aired on CBC Television (through \"Hockey Night in Canada\", as produced by Sportsnet through a brokerage agreement) in English, and TVA Sports in French.\nBeginning with this series, the NHL revised the schedule of the Stanley Cup Finals. From 2006 to 2015, the Finals typically followed a Monday–Wednesday–Saturday format. However, the NHL decided to alter the format so as to give teams an extra day off upon traveling from one city to another. These two-day layovers took place after Games 2, 4, 5, and 6. The National Basketball Association's championship series followed a similar format beginning that year as well to avoid head-to-head competition against the NHL's Cup Finals."

        "text": "The 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs was the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL) for the 2015–16 season. They began on April 13, 2016, and ended on June 12, 2016, with the Pittsburgh Penguins defeating the San Jose Sharks four games to two in the Stanley Cup Finals.\nFor only the second time in league history (1970 being the only other time), none of the NHL's seven Canadian-based teams qualified for the postseason. In addition, for the second season in a row and only the fifth (and most recent) time since joining the league in 1979, all four former WHA teams (the Edmonton Oilers, Arizona Coyotes, Carolina Hurricanes and Colorado Avalanche) missed the playoffs. The Washington Capitals made the playoffs as the Presidents' Trophy winners with the most points (i.e. best record) during the regular season. This was the final season of the Detroit Red Wings' 25-season playoff appearance streak, the longest streak at the time and tied for third longest in NHL history. The Florida Panthers qualified for the playoffs for only the second time since the 1999–2000 season—both times winning their division—and fifth time in franchise history. For the fourth time in six years, all three California-based teams made the playoffs in the same season. And, for only the second time ever (1996 being the only other time), both Florida-based teams made the playoffs in the same season.\nFor the first time since 2006, and only the third time in league history, all Original Six teams who made the playoffs (three in total) were eliminated in the first round. The New York Islanders won their first post-season series since the 1993 Stanley Cup playoffs, ending the third longest post-season win drought in NHL history. For the seventh consecutive season and eleventh out of thirteen seasons, a team from California was in the Western Conference final.\nFor the first time since 2002, no team lost in a four-game sweep in a playoff series.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThis was the third year in which the top three teams in each division make the playoffs, along with two wild cards in each conference (for a total of eight playoff teams from each conference).\nThe following teams qualified for the playoffs:\nPlayoff bracket.\nIn each round, teams competed in a best-of-seven series following a 2–2–1–1–1 format (scores in the bracket indicate the number of games won in each best-of-seven series). The team with home ice advantage played at home for games one and two (and games five and seven, if necessary), and the other team was at home for games three and four (and game six, if necessary). The top three teams in each division made the playoffs, along with two wild cards in each conference, for a total of eight teams from each conference.\nIn the first round, the lower seeded wild card in the conference played against the division winner with the best record while the other wild card played against the other division winner, and both wild cards were de facto #4 seeds. The other series matched the second and third place teams from the divisions. In the first two rounds, home ice advantage was awarded to the team with the better seed; in the last two rounds, it was awarded to the team that had the better regular season record.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nFirst round.\nEastern Conference first round.\n(A1) Florida Panthers vs. (WC1) New York Islanders.\nThe Florida Panthers finished first in the Atlantic Division, earning 103 points. The New York Islanders finished as the Eastern Conference's first wild-card, earning 100 points. This was the first meeting between these two teams. Florida won two of the three games of the regular season series. This was the first time that a Stanley Cup playoff series was played at the Barclays Center. The series contained the two teams with the longest playoff win drought in the league (the Islanders had not won a series since 1993, and the Panthers since 1996). The team that both clubs defeated for their last respective playoff series victory were the Pittsburgh Penguins, of which Panthers' right winger Jaromir Jagr was a member.\nThe Islanders defeated the Panthers in six games and won a playoff series for the first time since 1993. John Tavares scored a goal and two assists for the Islanders in a 5–4 win in game one. In game two, Roberto Luongo recorded 41 saves in a 3–1 win to help the Panthers tie the series. The Islanders came back from a two-goal deficit in the second period to win game three in overtime on Thomas Hickey's wrist shot. In game four, Jaromir Jagr had an assist to reach 200 points overall in the playoffs. The Panthers won the game 2–1. Games five and six both ended in double-overtime with identical scores of 2–1 and New York winning both games. In game five, Alan Quine scored the game-winner on a power play 16:00 into the second overtime. Thomas Greiss made 47 saves in the victory.

The table is sorted by GAA, and the criteria for inclusion are bolded.\nTelevision.\nThis marked the fifth postseason under NBC Sports' 10-year contract for American television rights, and the second under Sportsnet and TVA Sports' current 12-year contract for Canadian television rights. In the United States, all playoff games were nationally televised by either NBC, NBCSN, CNBC, USA Network, and NHL Network. During the first round, these national telecasts co-existed with those of the regional rightsholders, after which NBC had exclusive rights to the remaining games. In Canada, all games were aired in English during the second postseason coverage of Rogers Media's 12-year contract of exclusive NHL rights, through its Sportsnet channel and CBC (as part of \"Hockey Night in Canada\"), and in French by TVA Sports.\nWith all seven of the NHL's Canadian teams out of the playoffs, media sources predicted that Rogers would take a massive decline in viewership. During the regular season, the Sunday-night \"Hometown Hockey\" games saw ratings drop 34 percent, while \"Hockey Night in Canada\" fell 18 per cent, culminating in the season closer on April 9 that attracted just 721,000 viewers. To cut production costs, Rogers only employed three full-time play-by-play crews, along with a fourth on spot duty, during the first round. In the second round, Rogers only sent a crew for games broadcast on CBC, while simulcasting NBC's feeds for all other games (which aired on Sportsnet). \"The Hockey News\" estimated that Rogers saved per game if they simulcasted a U.S. feed instead of producing their own separate broadcast.\nRatings were also down in the United States, with the conference finals down by 9%, and ratings for the finals down to an average of 4 million viewers, making it the third-lowest-rated finals since 2006. The decline was credited to multiple factors, including the lack of Original Six teams or teams from key media markets such as Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York, and heavy competition from the 2016 NBA Playoffs and \"Game of Thrones\" (which aired against the series-ending game 6)."

        "title": "Emporia State Hornets baseball",
        "text": "The Emporia State Hornets baseball team represents Emporia State University in NCAA Division II college baseball. The team participates in the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association. The teams plays its home games on Glennen Field at Trusler Sports Complex, located just north of the Emporia State campus, and are coached by Brad Hill.\nHistory.\nThe second most successful era for ESU baseball was from 1974 to 1987, when the program was coached by former player Dave Bingham, who posted an overall record of 557–270–2 (), and won eight conference championships. From 1988 through the 2015 season, ESU's winning percentage increased to (943–530–1), and both Brian Embery and Bob Fornelli have a winning record with each having more than 450 wins. During the 2009 season, the Hornets were the national runners-up, competing in the NCAA Division II College World Series for the second time since joining the NCAA in 1991.\nEarly history (1949–1957).\nThe Kansas State Teachers College (KSTC), now Emporia State University, fielded its first baseball team in 1949, which was led by Bob Ives. Ives served two seasons as head coach, compiling a record of 19–9. For the next two seasons, KSTC had two coaches with a record of 19–10, and from 1953 to 1955, KSTC discontinued the program.\nIn 1956, KSTC had restarted the program with Chuck Sisson serving one season as head coach. After Sisson's season of going 4–4, Joe Pease, KSTC professor and later the athletic director for KSTC, became head coach for one season.\nFive coaches in 10 years.\nFrom 1958 to 1968, Emporia State had five coaches, two of which were interim coaches. Bill Kerr served as the head coach from 1958 to 1962, and finished with a record of 58–55. After the 1962 season, Kerr left Emporia and took a head coaching job in Kentucky. In February 1963, Richard Niclai succeeded Kerr as head coach. For the one season that Niclai was head coach, his record was 11–8, and following his departure was Larry Ensminger, who led the team for two winning seasons. After the 1965 season, Ensminger left to become the head coach at the University of Texas–Pan American. In 1966, the last year in the Hornets played in the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, Guy Owen served as the interim head coach, finishing the season with a 15–12 record. In 1967, Larry Cochell, an assistant coach at Utah State, took the reign as head coach as the Hornets began competing in their new conference, the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference. Cochell's first year was a losing season going 16–17, but quickly turn things around in 1968 and 1969, eventually leading the team to their first NAIA World Series appearance in 1969. Cochell left to become the head coach at Creighton in Nebraska after the 1969 season with a combined record of 72–44.\nJack Smitheran (1970–1973).\nIn 1970, Jack Smitheran, an assistant coach at Arizona State, was selected to replace Cochell. In his first season as head coach, he led the Hornets to their second straight NAIA World Series appearance. In 1972, Smitheran was nominated for NAIA Coach of the Year. After the 1973 season, Smitheran moved to Riverside, California to become the head coach at the University of California, Riverside.\nDave Bingham era (1974–1987).\nUnder Bingham's leadership, the Hornets won 11 district titles, five regional crowns and eight conference championships. He led ESU to five NAIA World Series appearances and won the national championship in 1978. Bingham was selected NAIA District X Coach of the Year 10 times, NAIA Area III Coach of the Year six times, and was recognized as the national coach of the year in 1976, 1984 and 1987. Until April 25, 2018, Bingham was the all-time winningest coach at Emporia State with 557 wins. Bob Fornelli, current head coach, passed Bingham on April 25, 2018.\nBrian Embery era (1988–2003).\nBrian Embery, an assistant under Bingham at Emporia State, was selected as the next head coach at Emporia State in 1988 after Bingham left for the University of Kansas. In his first year as head coach, and the team's last season in the Central States Intercollegiate Conference, the Hornets advanced to the NAIA Tournament. In 1993 the Hornets captured the school's first-ever MIAA Championship and participated in the NCAA Division II Tournament for the first time, allowing Embery to be the MIAA Coach of the Year. As a member of the NAIA, Embery led the Hornets to four consecutive NAIA District 10 titles from 1988–91. Embery was named District 10 Coach of the Year four times, and 15 players under his leadership earned All-American status. Embery was also a four time MIAA Coach of the Year award recipient.\nBob Fornelli era (2004–2018).\nAfter Embery resigned at the end of the 2003 season, Bob Fornelli, former Emporia State player under Embery, was named the head coach. Since 2004, Fornelli has taken the Hornets to the NCAA Tournament 12 times, has made 2 World Series appearances and a national runner-up finish in 2009. The Hornets finished the 2006 season by winning the MIAA Regular Season Championship and NCAA Central Region Championship, as well as advancing to the school's first NCAA World Series appearance.\nIn 2009, the Hornets advanced to the school's first NCAA national championship game in Cary, North Carolina. In 2014 the Hornets won the MIAA Tournament, and earned another trip to the NCAA Tournament.\nOn April 25, 2018, Fornelli became the winningest head baseball coach in Emporia State history with 558 wins. A week later on May 6, 2018, Fornelli captured his 900th win overall.\nOn June 4, 2018, local radio station KVOE (AM) reported that Fornelli had accepted the head coaching job at in-state MIAA rival, Pittsburg State University, after 15 seasons at his alma mater. He was formally introduced the next day, June 5.\nSeth Wheeler (2019–2023).\nOn June 15, 2018, Hornet pitcher coach Seth Wheeler was promoted to head coach. Wheeler had been an assistant coach for the Hornets since 2016. Wheeler was fired at the conclusion of the 2023 season.\nBrad Hill (2024–future).\nOn May 26, 2023, Brad Hill, former Emporia State baseball player, was announced as the next head baseball coach.\nVenue and culture.\nStadium.\nGlennen Field at Trusler Sports Complex opened in 1992. The field was named after Emporia State University President, Robert E. Glennen, who served from 1984 to 1997. In 2009, a new artificial turf was installed to Glennen Field to replace the infield. Glennen Field also received a new scoreboard and an indoor hitting facility during the 2009 season.\nSchool colors.\nEmporia State's official school colors are black and gold. They have been the colors since the school was founded in 1863, and until recently, the gold was Old gold.\nMascot.\nCorky the Hornet is Emporia State University's mascot. In 1923 when the Emporia State was named to the Kansas State Teachers College, the athletic teams were known as the \"Yaps\". Many people were not fond of the name, most notably Emporia State coach, Vic Trusler. Trusler suggested to Cecil Carle of the \"Emporia Gazette\" that the university's athletic teams should be called the \"Yellow Jackets\". However, the name changed to \"Hornets\" due to the lack of newspaper space.\nIn 1933, the Teachers College had a student contest where students and staff could design a mascot for the college. Sophomore Paul Edwards, who graduated in 1937, designed Corky. Although hundreds of drawings were submitted, Edwards' Corky, a \"human-like\" hornet was selected. Corky was published in \"The Bulletin\", the student newspaper for Emporia State University."

It was established to replace the Las Vegas Desert Classic, and featured the 501-point and cricket formats. There was a £200,000 prize fund divided between all five events.\nThe World Cricket Championship (WCC) was won by Phil Taylor, the world number one, who defeated Mark Walsh in the final. Taylor went on to beat Denis Ovens for the PDC US Open Players Championship (USOPC). The Las Vegas Players Championship 1 (LVPC1) was won by Gary Anderson over Simon Whitlock, with Co Stompé taking the Las Vegas Players Championship 2 (LVPC2) from James Wade. John Part defeated Darin Young to win the North American Darts Championship (NADC).\nOverview.\nThe World Series of Darts Festival was a series of five professional darts tournaments organised by the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) and took place in the Tropicana Ballroom of the Tropicana Hotel, in Las Vegas, Nevada, between 26 and 30 June 2010, in lieu of the Las Vegas Desert Classic. The five events were the World Cricket Championship (WCC), the PDC US Open Players Championship (USOPC), the Las Vegas Players Championship 1 (LVPC1), the Las Vegas Players Championship 2 (LVPC2) and the North American Darts Championship (NADC).\nAll five competitions were part of the 2010 North American Order of Merit from which the first and second ranked players were invited to the 2011 PDC World Darts Championship. The three Players Championship events were counted towards both the PDC Order of Merit and the Players Championship Order of Merit and were the last such competitions prior to the qualifiers cut-off date for the World Matchplay.\nA total of 155 entrants composed of 82 from the Professional Dart Players Association and 73 from North America played in the World Series of Darts Festival. Each of the five tournaments began at 12:00 local time and were contested to a different length. WCC games were best-of-five legs with the remaining four competitions being best-of-eleven legs. The NADC saw 80 participants from Canada and the United States with eight seeds from the top-ranked eight players on the PDC Order of Merit. Seeds were not used for the WCC but were for the three Players Championship events.\nPrize money.\nThe prize money for each of the five competitions is shown below. A total of £200,000 was divided between the five tournaments with a rolling nine-dart finish prize of £400 per PDC Pro Tour competition.\nWorld Cricket Championship\nPlayers Championship events\nNorth American Darts Championship\nTournament summary.\nThe event began with the WCC on 26 June, which was the second of the ten non-ranking events on the 2010 calendar. Phil Taylor, the world number one, defeated Howard Meyers, Andy Fordham, Kirk Shepherd, Richie Burnett and Steve Beaton to reach the semi-finals, while Mark Walsh lost five only legs en route to beating Scott Kirchner, Adrian Lewis, Vincent van der Voort, Andy Hamilton and Ronnie Baxter to reach the same stage. Walsh beat Darin Young 3–1 for the first final spot and Taylor took the second with a 3–0 whitewash of Mark Dudbridge. Walsh won the first two legs before Taylor took the next two to equalise at 2–2. In the final leg, Taylor secured the 20 bed before Walsh took the 19, 18, 17 and 15 beds. Taylor subsequently won the match 3–2 on two bullseye rings. Taylor said he was \"really happy\" to win due to the difficulty of playing the cricket format but commented it \"really makes you think and it's a great leveller.\"\nThe second tournament was the USOPC on 27 June, which was the 27th of the 45 events in the 2010 PDC Pro Tour. Taylor defeated Kevin McDine, Paul Lim, Joe Cullen, Nigel Heydon, Walsh and James Wade, as Denis Ovens beat Dieter Schutsch, Shintaro Hirai, Ken MacNeil, Steve Hine, Terry Jenkins and Jelle Klaasen to set up the final; Ovens played his fourth final of the season. Taylor won the first two legs and Ovens the third on the double 19 ring. Finishes on the double 18 and 20 rings put Taylor three legs ahead before Ovens used Taylor's miss on the double 16 ring in leg six to complete an 108 checkout on the double 20 ring to be 4–2 behind. Taylor took two of the next three legs with finishes on the double 8 and 20 rings to claim a 6–3 victory and a second successive tournament win. Colin Lloyd won £2,000 prize money for achieving a nine-dart finish in his 6–3-second round victory over Dave Switzer, the third of his professional career.\nThe third competition was the LVPC1 contested on 28 June, which was the 28th of the 45 competitions in the 2010 PDC Pro Tour. Gary Anderson qualified for the final with victories over Mark Hylton, Chris Loudon, Mark Webster, Steve Maish, Lim and Lloyd, while Simon Whitlock defeated Sean Smyth, Donny Joe, Colin Monk, Ovens, MacNeil and Chris Thompson. After Whitlock won the opening leg on the double 10 ring, Anderson took three legs in a row to lead 3–1. Both players shared the next two legs before Whitlock won legs seven and eight to tie at 4–4. Finishes on the double 20 and 8 rings gave Anderson a 6–4 victory. It was Anderson's third tournament win of the season, earning a provisional top 16 spot in the PDC Order of Merit, with Paul Nicholson at risk of failing to qualify for the Players Championship Finals with Heydon ahead of him in its Order of Merit.\nThe LVPC2 played on 29 June was the fourth event and the 29th of the 45 tournaments in the 2010 PDC Pro Tour. Co Stompé reached the final with wins over Edwin Martin, Wayne Mardle, Lewis, Beaton, Klaasen and Matt Clark, joined by Wade who beat MacNeil, Tony Randell, Robert Thornton, Van der Voort, Whitlock and Lloyd. Wade won the first leg before Stompe took the following four with two maximum scores for a 4–1 lead. He took the next two legs to go one leg behind before Stompe secured two more legs to win 6–3. It was Stompe's first PDC Pro Tour event win since he made his PDC debut in 2008, and his second of three titles following the 2008 German Darts Championship and preceding the 2010 PDC World Cup of Darts alongside Raymond van Barneveld. Nicholson reached the third round to reclaim 16th place in the PDC Order of Merit and automatically qualified for the World Matchplay.\nThe last tournament was the NADC on 30 June, the third of the ten non-ranking competitions in the 2010 season. Wins over Alvin Martin, Greg Lewis, Shawn Brenneman, Chris White and Gary Mawson earned John Part a place in the final opposite Young, who defeated Eddie Lawrence, Dan Lauby, Joe, Nico Depaynos and Larry Butler. Part took three of the first four legs on checkouts of 68, 111 and 84. Young took legs five and six to equalise before Part took two more legs. Part missed the double 20 ring to complete an 108 checkout for victory and Young struck the double 5 ring to win leg nine. Part made a maximum score and hit the double 4 ring to win the tournament by 6–4. Part called it \"an emotional day and not easy to play\" but felt he had played better than in previous tournaments.\nBrackets.\nNumbers given to the left of players' names show the seedings for four of the five tournaments.

In 1997, FIFA published guidelines for classifying an own goal as \"when a player plays the ball directly into his own net or when he redirects an opponent’s shot, cross or pass into his own goal\", and excludes \"shots that are on target (i.e. goal-bound) and touch a defender or rebound from the goal frame and bounce off a defender or goalkeeper\". This is a list of all own goals scored during FIFA Women's World Cup matches (not including qualification games).\nThe United States has scored four own goals for their opponents, while Norway has benefited from five own goals. Of the 31 matches with own goals, the team scoring the own goal has won five times and drawn three times. All but eight own goals have been scored in the group stage of the tournament.\nThe only player to score two own goals is Angie Ponce from Ecuador, scoring twice for Switzerland in 2015.

        "title": "When My Ships Come Sailing Home",
        "text": "\"When My Ships Come Sailing Home\" is an American song composed by Francis Dorel and lyrics by Reginald Stewart. The sheet music for the song was distributed as early as 1913 by Boosey &amp; Co, one of the forerunners of the Boosey &amp; Hawkes publishing firm. \nThe song was recorded by John McCormack representing the Victor label on March 29, 1915. The song failed to peak on American charts during that year.\nSheet Music.\nThe original sheet music is scored for vocals and piano. According to the sheet music, one is supposed the play the song \"Slowly and Evenly\". The composer attempts to emphasize this fact with note telling the player that certain parts are meant to be played \"dreamily\". The time signature of the piece is set as common time, or 4:4. It was produced and distributed by Boosey &amp; Co. in 1913, with a stipulation along the bottom of the cover stating that \"This song may be sung in public without fee or license. The public performance of any parodied version, however, is strictly prohibited\". Four versions of sheet music were distributed; the first version was in the key of \"F\", the second in the key of \"C\", the third version in the key of \"A flat\", and the fourth version in the key of \"B flat\". One would be able to differentiate the different versions by looking at the top of the sheet music cover. The four version would be pictured side by side, and the one that was enclosed would have a line underneath it.\nRecordings.\nThe song was first recorded by John McCormack for the Victor \"Red Seal\" record label on March 29, 1915. The recording was made in Camden, New Jersey, with the second take of the second take of the song was kept as the master copy for distribution. McCormack's recording did not place in American charts that year. The Victor matrix number of his recording is kept as \"C-15839\". Various copies of McCormack's recording are available on YouTube.\nFurther recordings were made by Herbert Witherspoon, Ethel Whiteside, Franklin Booth, each for the Victor recording label.\nWitherspoon recorded his version of the song on September 18, 1917, in Camden. Both takes of his recordings, however, were scrapped. The Victor matrix number of his recordings is kept as \"B-20676\".\nEthel Whiteside's recording differed from the previous two in that it was not made with orchestral accompaniment. Instead, Whiteside was accompanied by piano. Whiteside's first take recorded on November 6, 1919, was discarded and currently it is unknown if it survives. The Victor matrix number of her recording is kept as \"Trial 1919-11-06-02\".\nThe final recording of the song was made by Franklin Booth on May 26, 1925. Like Whiteside, Booth was accompanied by piano rather than orchestra. Of Booth's two takes, the first one was used as the master for distribution while the second was discarded. The Victor matrix number of his recording is kept as \"CVE-32825\"."

        "title": "Kent County Cricket Club in 2015",
        "text": "In 2015, Kent County Cricket Club competed in Division Two of the County Championship, Group B of the 50-over Royal London One-Day Cup and the South Group of the NatWest t20 Blast. The team reached the quarter-finals of both one day competitions but struggled in the County Championship, finishing seventh in Division Two.\nThe season was the fourth in charge for head coach Jimmy Adams. The club captain was former England batsmen Rob Key, although Sam Northeast took over the on-field captaincy in May after Key, having dropped himself due to poor form, chose to relinquish the captaincy to concentrate on his batting. Northeast replaced Key as the club captain for the 2016 season.\nTwo players from the Kent squad made senior international appearances for England in 2015. James Tredwell was a part of the World Cup squad, but only featured in the final group stage match against Afghanistan after both sides had already been eliminated from the tournament. He then played in the first Test against the West Indies in Antigua (only his second Test, having made his debut in 2010). Tredwell took 5 wickets in the match but did not play in the remainder of the series, and with England turning to several younger players after the disappointing World Cup, he was not selected during the English summer. One of the new faces in the England team over the summer was Kent keeper Sam Billings who played as a specialist batsmen in all 5 ODI matches against Australia and the single T20I matches against both Australia and New Zealand.\nMatt Coles won the club's Player of the Year award, taking 100 wickets across all formats in the first season of his second spell at the county.\nSquad.\nThe start of the season saw the return of top-order batsman Joe Denly and fast bowler Matt Coles after spells at Middlesex and Hampshire, respectively. The squad did not include an overseas player.\nSouth African born batsman Sean Dickson, who holds a UK passport, signed for the county midway through the season after an impressive trial in the Second XI. Having not made an appearance for the first XI since May, former West Indies international Brendan Nash agreed to end his three-and-a-half year spell at Kent by mutual consent.\nCounty Championship.\nKent endured another difficult season in Division Two of the County Championship. Poor batting performances ultimately resulted in a seventh-place finish, although the team finished the season strongly and ended with 4 victories. The team regularly featured a number of young players and the bowling was impressive. Matt Coles took 67 championship wickets in 14 matches on his return to the county (and 100 wickets across all formats), while veteran all-rounder Darren Stevens again made a significant contribution with the ball. In addition, young seam bowlers including Calum Haggett and Ivan Thomas impressed throughout the season and were rewarded with contract extensions while Matt Hunn broke into the side after taking his first five wicket haul against the touring Australian side in June.\nOther first-class match.\nKent hosted a first-class match at the St Lawrence Ground against Australia, providing the tourists first opposition of the 2015 Ashes tour. Australia won the game by 225 runs, although Kent opening batsman Daniel Bell-Drummond scored a century in the side's second innings and seamer Matt Hunn took his first five wickets haul.\nRoyal London One-Day Cup.\nIn the 2015 Royal London One-Day Cup, Kent edged through the group stage in fourth place after a thrilling run chase against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in the penultimate round of group games saw a target of 336 achieved with 8 balls to spare. The match featured a century from Sam Billings and a hat-trick for bowler Matt Coles. The final round of games in the group were all washed out by rain and the county progressed into the quarter-finals on net run rate.\nKent lost the quarter-final against Surrey in a rain affected match at The Oval. After bowling Surrey out for 273, a target of 251 from 40 overs was set using the Duckworth-Lewis Method following a heavy rain storm at the start of the Kent innings. Despite a counter-attacking century from Matt Coles, Kent were bowled out for 233.\nNatWest t20 Blast.\nAfter a series of good performances, Kent's young side topped the South Group of the 2015 NatWest t20 Blast but went out of the competition at the quarter-final stage to Lancashire. After being bowled out for 142, late wickets led to a \"dramatic\" finish with Lancashire scoring two runs off the last ball of the match to tie the game with a score of 142/6. Lancashire progressed to the finals day due to losing fewer wickets.\nMCCU match.\nKent played a three-day match, without first-class status, against Loughborough MCC University before the start of the County Championship season.\nStatistics.\nSam Northeast and Joe Denly both made over a thousand runs in first-class cricket in 2015 with Denly making the highest score for the county. Daniel Bell-Drummond scored three first-class centuries during the season and led the team in List A runs. Northeast scored a county record high score of 114 runs in the Twenty20 competition.\nMatt Coles led the bowling statistics with 100 wickets across all competitions during the season, including 67 in first-class matches. Coles took a hat-trick in the Royal London One Day Cup quarter final loss to Surrey. Mitchell Claydon led the Twenty20 bowling statistics."

        "text": "The New Zealand cricket team toured Australia from 23 October to 1 December 2015 to play three Test matches and four tour matches. The third match of the series at the Adelaide Oval was the first ever day-night Test. Michael Hussey captained the Prime Minister's XI side for the tour match, and in preparation for the day-night Test, a pink ball was used in this game. Australia won the series 2–0, with victories in Brisbane and Adelaide, with the second Test in Perth being drawn.\nFollowing the conclusion of the Adelaide Test, New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum said that day-night Test cricket is \"here to stay\" and that \"it's a great concept\". The Australian captain Steve Smith also had praise for the day-night Test saying that \"the whole Test match was a great innovation, it was a great spectacle\". Media reaction to the first day-night Test was also positive, with many news outlets praising the innovation. However, following the match the majority of players who took part in the game said that there needs considerable work on floodlit Test cricket. Twenty of the twenty-two players who responded supported the concept of day-night Test cricket but work on the pink ball needed further refinement.\nSquads.\nAll-rounder Corey Anderson was ruled out of New Zealand's Test series in Australia because of an ongoing back problem. Anderson was replaced by the uncapped Mitchell Santner for the Test series. Neil Wagner was added to New Zealand's squad after Tim Southee suffered a back injury during the first Test. James Neesham was ruled out of the rest of the series after injuring his back in the first Test. He was replaced by Mitchell McClenaghan. Before the inaugural day/night Test in Adelaide, Shaun Marsh replaced Usman Khawaja and James Pattinson replaced the retired Mitchell Johnson. Stephen O'Keefe was released the day of the Test after the pitch condition was inspected. Mitchell Starc suffered a stress fracture to his right foot during the first day of the Adelaide Test and was ruled out of bowling for the rest of the match.\nTour matches.\nFirst-class match: Cricket Australia XI v New Zealanders.\nThe match was abandoned after the Cricket Australia XI's declaration shortly before lunch on Day 2 due to an unsafe pitch. The New Zealanders had become concerned about the state of the pitch after some dangerously high bouncing deliveries late on Day 1; the match continued on the morning of Day 2 with the New Zealanders bowling only its spinners, the Cricket Australia XI declared immediately after Ryan Carters' dismissal, and the match was not resumed.\nTest series (Trans-Tasman Trophy).\n1st Test.\nThe first Test of the series resulted in a dominant Australian victory. After winning the toss, Australia on back of centuries from David Warner and Usman Khawaja and half centuries from Joe Burns and Adam Voges declared their innings at 4/556. New Zealand in reply had a steady start before a middle-order collapse left them struggling at the end of day 2. However, Kane Williamson's 140 meant that Australia didn't enforce the follow-on. However, Warner's second century and Burns maiden ton resulted in New Zealand being set a target of 504 runs. Another middle-order collapse meant that despite rain interruptions on day 3 and day 4 Australia comfortably won the Test by 208 runs."

In June 2015, New Zealand Cricket were in talks with Cricket Australia to have a tour consisting of two Tests and three One Day Internationals (ODIs). In August 2015, the fixtures were announced which contained the reduction of Tests from three to two and the addition of the three ODIs.\nIn December 2015 New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum announced that he would be retiring from all forms of international cricket at the conclusion of the series. New Zealand won the ODI series 2–1 to retain the Chappell–Hadlee Trophy. McCullum finished his ODI career with the best win–loss ratio of any New Zealander who has captained in ten or more matches. In his final match, McCullum broke the record for the fastest century scored in Test cricket. Australia won the Test series 2–0, to retain the Trans-Tasman Trophy and regain the number one position in the ICC Test Championship.\nAdam Voges, who hit the winning runs, finished the Test series with a batting average of 95.50.\nSquads.\nJames Faulkner was ruled out of Australia's squad after suffering a hamstring injury in the first ODI. He was replaced by Marcus Stoinis. Kane Richardson was ruled out of the last two ODIs due to a back injury. He was replaced in the squad by Joel Paris. Mark Craig replaced Mitchell Santner after Santer was ruled out due to bone bruise in his left foot. Peter Siddle missed the second Test due to a back injury sustained in the first Test."

Before the first World Cup race it was determined that the men's C2 class would be removed from the Olympic program. This resulted in a reduced number of participants in this event. The C2 mixed event was raced for the first time as part of the World Cup in Prague, though only 4 crews entered (3 of them Czech) and no points were awarded. The K1 cross was renamed as Extreme Kayak, but still no world cup points were awarded for the event.\nCalendar.\nThe series opened with World Cup Race 1 in Prague, Czech Republic (June 16–18) and concluded with the World Cup Final in La Seu d'Urgell, Spain (September 8–10).\nStandings.\nThe winner of each race was awarded 60 points (double points were awarded for the World Cup Final for all the competitors who reached at least the semifinal stage). Points for lower places differed from one category to another. Every participant was guaranteed at least 2 points for participation and 5 points for qualifying for the semifinal run (10 points in the World Cup Final). If two or more athletes or boats were equal on points, the ranking was determined by their positions in the World Cup Final.\nResults.\nWorld Cup Race 1.\nThe first World Cup event in Prague, Czech Republic, held from 16 to 18 June, saw the introduction of the C2 mixed class to the World Cup. Only 4 boats entered the event, three of which were from the host nation.

        "text": "The men's artistic individual all-around competition at the 2016 Summer Olympics was held on 6 and 10 August 2016 at the HSBC Arena. Kōhei Uchimura won gold, becoming the first male gymnast in 44 years (and third overall) to do this in two successive Olympic Games. Uchimura also became the second man to earn three all-around medals, matching countryman Sawao Kato with two golds and one silver. Uchimura's victory was Japan's sixth in the men's all-around, tying the Soviet Union for most all-time. His margin of victory was only 0.099, which was less than one small step on landing in terms of gymnastic scoring. It was also his eighth consecutive victory at the top competition of the year (World Championships and Olympics from 2009 to 2016). Oleg Verniaiev's silver was Ukraine's first medal in the event since 2000. Max Whitlock's bronze was Great Britain's first since the 1908 Games in London.\nThe medals were presented by Princess Nora of Liechtenstein, IOC Member from Liechtenstein, accompanied by Vasily Titov, FIG Executive Committee member.\nBackground.\nThis was the 27th appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nFive of the top 10 gymnasts from the 2012 Games returned. Gold medalist Kōhei Uchimura of Japan, silver medalist Marcel Nguyen of Germany, 4th place finisher Nikolai Kuksenkov of Ukraine (now competing for Russia), 5th place finisher David Belyavskiy of Russia, and 10th place finisher Sergio Sasaki of Brazil. Uchimura was favored and had been dominant for the last two Olympic cycles. He had followed the silver all-around medal in 2008 with three World Championships (2009–2011), Olympic gold in 2012, and then three more World Championships (2013–2015).\nCyprus and Lithuania each made their debut in the event. France made its 25th appearance, most among nations.\nQualification.\nQualification for the men's artistic gymnastics in 2016 was based primarily on the 2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. The top 8 teams at the world championships could send a full team of 5 gymnasts to the Olympics. The next 8 teams (#9 through #16) competed in the 2012 Gymnastics Olympic Test Event, with the top 4 of those teams also qualifying a team of 5 gymnasts for the Olympics. The individual apparatus medalists from the World Championships also qualified, if their nation had not already qualified a team. There were places reserved for host country and continental representation, and the Tripartite Commission made an invitation. The quota of 98 gymnasts was then filled through the individual all-around rankings at the Test Event, with each nation able to qualify only one gymnast in that manner (though this one gymnast could be added to the world championship apparatus medalists—e.g., Romania qualified Marian Drăgulescu as silver medalist in the vault and Andrei Muntean through the Test Event).\nOnly gymnasts competing in all six apparatus exercises in the qualifying round were ranked for the individual all-around qualifying.\nCompetition format.\nThe top 24 qualifiers in the qualification phase (limit two per NOC), based on combined score of each apparatus, advanced to the individual all-around final. The finalists will perform on each apparatus again, and scores in qualification do not count anymore. Scoring was according to the Code of Points. \nResults.\nQualifying.\nThe gymnasts who ranked top twenty four qualified for final round. In case of there were more than two gymnasts in same NOC, the last ranked among them would not qualify to final round. The next best ranked gymnast would qualify instead.\nFinal.\nBoth Georgiou and Larduet were forced to retire from the competition due to injury."

The event was won by Ri Se-gwang of North Korea, the nation's first medal in the men's vault. Denis Ablyazin repeated as silver medalist, the eighth man to win multiple medals in the event. Kenzō Shirai earned Japan's first medal in the men's vault since 1984 with his bronze.\nThe medals were presented by Chang Ung, IOC Member, People's Republic of Korea, and Ali Al-Hitmi, FIG Executive Committee Member.\nBackground.\nThis was the 24th appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Three of the eight finalists from 2012 returned—silver medalist Denis Ablyazin of Russia, bronze medalist Igor Radivilov of Ukraine, and fourth-place finisher Tomás González of Chile. Two other 2012 finalists, fifth-place finisher Samuel Mikulak of the United States and eighth-place finisher Kristian Thomas of Great Britain, competed in gymnastics in Rio de Janeiro but did not perform the necessary two vaults in the qualifying round to compete in the vault. Marian Drăgulescu of Romania, the 2004 bronze medalist and 2008 fourth-place finisher, also returned. The favorite was Ri Se-gwang of North Korea, who had won the last two world championships (2014 and 2015).\nLithuania made its debut in the men's vault. The United States made its 21st appearance, most of any nation.\nQualification.\nQualification for the men's artistic gymnastics in 2008 was based primarily on the 2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. The top 8 teams at the world championships could send a full team of 5 gymnasts to the Olympics. The next 8 teams (#9 through #16) competed in the 2012 Gymnastics Olympic Test Event, with the top 4 of those teams also qualifying a team of 5 gymnasts for the Olympics. The individual apparatus medalists from the World Championships also qualified, if their nation had not already qualified a team. There were places reserved for host country and continental representation, and the Tripartite Commission made an invitation. The quota of 98 gymnasts was then filled through the individual all-around rankings at the Test Event, with each nation able to qualify only one gymnast in that manner (though this one gymnast could be added to the world championship apparatus medalists—for example, Romania qualified Marian Drăgulescu as silver medalist in vault and Andrei Muntean through Test Event).\nCompetition format.\nThe top 8 qualifiers in the qualification phase (limit two per NOC) advanced to the apparatus final. On vault, only gymnasts who performed two skills on vault were considered for the final. The average score of the two skills was counted. The finalists again performed two vaults. Qualification scores were then ignored with only final round scores (average of the two skills) counting.\nResults.\nQualifying.\nThe gymnasts who ranked top eight qualified for final round. In case of there were more than two gymnasts in same NOC, the last ranked among them would not qualify to final round. The next best ranked gymnast would qualify instead. Although four gymnasts (Shirai, Radivilov, Drăgulescu and Nagornyy) posted third highest average score (15.283), tiebreak procedures were activated and successfully separated each athlete by rank. Shirai ranked ahead in third while Nagornyy ranked sixth overall due to highest (15.466) and lowest (15.300) single vault score. Because Drăgulescu and Radivilov had identical scores on both vaults, their ranks were then separated by identifying the single top E-score among their already-completed vaults, resulting in Radivilov ranking ahead in fourth and Drăgulescu in fifth overall (9.433 vs 9.333). \nFinal.\nThe tiebreak procedure was used due to final scores tying for third highest. Kenzō Shirai of Japan won the bronze medal with Marian Drăgulescu of Romania placing fourth due to Shirai's top vault score being higher than Drăgulescu's (15.833 versus 15.633), and with identical scores in total, and separate vaults as well as both E- and D-scores, Nikita Nagornyy of Russia and Oleg Verniaiev of Ukraine ended the competition in a rare tie for fifth place since the tiebreak procedure would be ineffective in such instances. Ties at the Olympics are far less common since 2000 (thanks to new tie-breaking rules), but remain possible if the total, E- and then D-scores of both vaults all finished with identical values. Shirai and Ihor Radivilov of Ukraine also successfully originated two new skills in the final—the Shirai 2, 3½-twisting Yurchenko, and Radivilov, handspring triple front somersault, even though the latter did have a crash landing. Despite that, the reason justifying the naming credit was because Radivilov was able to perform skill, landing feet first, which the rules had to count it as a valid vault, and thus the skill including its high D-score had to also be accepted into the Code of Points. The Shirai 2 is now 1 of 5 vaults with the top D-score of 6.0 in the 2017–2020 Code of Points, but even with the highest assigned D-score of 7.0, the Radivilov has since been banned after Rio by the FIG in competitions due to the determined high risk of injury factor when attempting and training the skill.\nt"

But on this occasion Shirai had problems with his landings on three of his six passes. In separate interviews after the competition, both Shirai and American Sam Mikulak, who was the top qualifier but finished in last place, expressed disappointment with the crowd, whose booing and jeering had grown increasingly loud during non-Brazilian routines as the competition went on.

The United States made its 22nd appearance, most of any nation; the Americans had missed only the inaugural 1896 event and the boycotted 1980 Games.\nQualification.\nQualification for the men's artistic gymnastics in 2016 was based primarily on the 2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. The top 8 teams at the world championships could send a full team of 5 gymnasts to the Olympics. The next 8 teams (#9 through #16) competed in the 2012 Gymnastics Olympic Test Event, with the top 4 of those teams also qualifying a team of 5 gymnasts for the Olympics. The individual apparatus medalists from the World Championships also qualified, if their nation had not already qualified a team. There were places reserved for host country and continental representation, and the Tripartite Commission made an invitation. The quota of 98 gymnasts was then filled through the individual all-around rankings at the Test Event, with each nation able to qualify only one gymnast in that manner (though this one gymnast could be added to the world championship apparatus medalists—for example, Romania qualified Marian Drăgulescu as silver medalist on vault and Andrei Muntean through Test Event).\nCompetition format.\nThe top 8 qualifiers in the qualification phase (with a maximum of two per NOC), advanced to the individual all-around final. The finalists performed on each apparatus again. Qualification scores do not count in the final.\nResults.\nQualifying.\nThe gymnasts who ranked top eight qualified for final round. In case of there were more than two gymnasts in same NOC, the last ranked among them would not qualify to final round. The next best ranked gymnast would qualify instead."

Johnson, moved north after the war and became a streetcar magnate, with operations in Indianapolis, Cleveland and New York City. The younger Johnson learned the business and, with the wealth gained, largely bankrolled the Players' League. He also owned the Cleveland Infants franchise in the new league. The 1890 Infants finished with a record of 55–75, seventh place in the eight-team Players' League.\nJohnson purchased the Cincinnati Reds during the 1890–91 off-season, intending to move the team from the National League to the Players' League. However, in the aftermath of the league's first season, a year in which all baseball owners lost money, the new league folded. Johnson then sold the Reds to John T. Brush.\nJohnson died at his home in Brooklyn in July 1901, of a heart attack. Newspaper reports of his death differed as to if he was married or not.

It is the second most prestigious title in the discipline after the 800 metres at the Olympics. The competition format typically has two qualifying rounds leading to a final between eight athletes.\nThe championship records for the event are 1:43.06 for men, set by Billy Konchellah in 1987, and 1:54.68 for women, set by Jarmila Kratochvílová in 1983. Set at the inaugural championships, Kratochvílová's record is the longest-standing record of the competition. The 800 m world record has never been broken at the competition by either men or women.\nMaria Mutola is the most successful athlete of the event: from a period spanning 1993 to 2003, she won three gold medals, one silver and one bronze in the World Championships 800 m. The most successful man is Wilson Kipketer, who won three straight titles from 1995 to 1999. Only two other people, Billy Konchellah and Ana Fidelia Quirot, have won two world championship titles in the event. Yuriy Borzakovskiy, though never a champion, has won the most medals in the men's competition, with two silver and two bronze medals.\nKenya is the most successful nation in the discipline, with five gold medals in the men's, two in the women's race, and a total of 13 medals overall. The actions of Mutola and Kipketer alone rank Mozambique at the top of the women's rankings and Denmark second in the men's medal table. Cuba—the second most successful nation among women—has won three women's gold medals. South Africa is the only nation besides Kenya to have provided both a men's and women's winner. Russia has the second highest overall medal tally, with eleven medals across the men's and women's divisions, but it has also provided six of the eight athletes sanctioned for doping at this World Championship distance.\nAge records.\n The exact date of birth of the youngest male participant, Mohamed Abd el Rahman, is unknown but he remains the youngest given his known year of birth and calculating from 1 January of that year.\nDoping.\nA total of nine athletes, all of them women and seven of them Russian, have had their 800 m results annulled at the World Championships due to doping infractions. The first was Delisa Floyd of the United States (1991 semi-finalist) was among the first few women to be disqualified from the championships for doping. The 1993 finalist Liliya Nurutdinova was the only woman disqualified at the 1993 championships. Another Russian, Lyubov Tsyoma, had her semi-final run in 1997 annulled. Ten years passed without incident until a third Russian, Svetlana Cherkasova was struck from the heats for doping in 2007.\nTwo women semi-finalists were disqualified for doping in 2009: a fourth Russian, Svetlana Klyuka, and Tetiana Petlyuk of Ukraine. Petlyuk was retrospectively banned through a biological passport anomaly and this also took in her run at the 2011 World Championships. That same year two more Russians were disqualified, both of them finalists: Yuliya Rusanova and Yekaterina Kostetskaya. In 2017, the third Russian finalist, gold medalist Mariya Savinova was banned for life, retroactive to 2010, making it a clean sweep of disqualified Russians in 2011, as well as taking Savinova's silver in 2013. Both times Alysia Johnson Montaño advanced to take the bronze medal."

        "text": "The 2015 Wimbledon Championships Men's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men's Singles tournament at the 2015 Wimbledon Championships.\nA significant part of the Djokovic–Federer rivalry, it pitted defending champion Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer against each other in a Grand Slam final for the third time, a rematch of the Wimbledon final a year earlier in which Djokovic defeated Federer in five sets. Before the match, Federer led the head-to-head 20 matches to 19, with the two players tied one to one on grass and one to one in Grand Slam finals.\nThis was the first time the top two seeds had met in a men's Grand Slam final since the 2014 French Open, which pitted Rafael Nadal (1) against Djokovic (2).\nBackground.\nFederer, a winner of 17 Grand Slams, was appearing in his 26th Grand Slam final and tenth Wimbledon final. He was seeking a record eighth Wimbledon title, which would rank him above Pete Sampras, who won the tournament seven times. Djokovic, a winner of eight Grand Slams, was appearing in his 17th Grand Slam final and fourth Wimbledon final. He was seeking his third Wimbledon title and looking to defend his win of the previous year.\nBuild-up.\nThis was a rematch of the previous year's final where Djokovic had won in five sets. Federer had shown strong form in the tournament. He had reached the semi-final against Andy Murray losing just one set and completed all his previous rounds with less than ten hours spent on the court. In the semi-final, he beat Murray in straight sets to set up his opportunity for a record 8th Wimbledon and 18th Grand Slam win. On the other half of the draw, Djokovic had barely survived after a scare of a fourth round elimination against Kevin Anderson whom he beat from two sets down. Djokovic had also recently lost in the French Open final against Stan Wawrinka, and was considered to be vulnerable at times.\nMatch.\nDjokovic won the first set, before Federer made a comeback to win the second set in a close tie-breaker, saving seven set points in the process. By the third set, however, Djokovic started to tighten his grip on the match as Federer's count of unforced errors rose. In some crucial moments, Djokovic was able to defend break points, and eventually, it became too much for Federer to sustain the challenge. In the end, Djokovic won in four sets."

The race usually covers approximately 3,500 kilometres (2,200 mi), passing through France and neighbouring countries such as Belgium. The race is broken into day-long segments, called stages. Individual finishing times for each stage are totalled to determine the overall winner at the end of the race.\nThe course changes every year, but has always finished in Paris; since 1975 it has finished along the Champs-Élysées. The start of the course is known as the Grand Départ. Since the 1950s it has typically taken place in a different town each year, and since the 1970s it has been common to award the Grand Départ to cities outside France as a way of increasing international interest in the competition and the sport. The right to host the Grand Départ is now highly sought after, with cities bidding to host, and has been shown to increase economic activity as well as interest in cycling in the host area.\nIn 2024, the first Grand Départ outside France for the Tour de France Femmes will take place in Rotterdam, in the Netherlands."

The regular season started on 29 August 2015 and finished on 24 April 2016, followed by the semi-finals and the championship final, the latter held on 7 May 2016, with the DRV-Pokal and the promotion-relegation play-off continuing until June 2016. The season was interrupted by a winter break from early November to early March.\nThe defending champions were Heidelberger RK who defeated TV Pforzheim 53–27 in the 2015 final to take out its twelfth championship and sixth in a row. The club thereby also equaled a championship record, becoming the second club after TSV Victoria Linden to win six consecutive titles. The 2016 championship was won by TV Pforzheim, defeating Heidelberger RK 41–36 in the final. For Pforzheim it was the first national rugby union championship, an achievement seen as a surprise given the dominance of Heidelberg, having defeated Pforzheim in three previous finals. \nThe modus and size of the league had been altered from the 2014–15 season, with the number of clubs reduced from, nominally, 24 to 16.\nOverview.\nThe Rugby-Bundesliga, which had been playing with 21 clubs in 2014–15, three less than the nominal strength of 24, was reduced to 16 clubs for 2015–16. The previous season, the league played a first round of four regional groups, followed by a second round with two regional groups of eight, and play-offs consisting of twelve teams, Instead, the 2015–16 season saw a reduction to just two regional groups of eight teams each.\nIn the 2015–16 Bundesliga each team plays the other seven in their division twice, home and away, during the regular season. No games will be played between clubs from opposite divisions during this phase. The regular season will be followed by play-offs in which the winner of the south-west division plays the runners-up of the north-east and the winner of the north-east the runners-up of the south-west division. The two semi-final winners then contest the German championship final, scheduled for 21 May 2016.\nThe remaining twelve teams enter the DRV-Pokal, whereby the clubs placed third and fourth receive a bye for the first round. The last placed team in each division will be automatically relegated to the 2. Rugby-Bundesliga. The second-last team in each division has to play the 2. Bundesliga semi-final losers for a place in the 2016–17 Rugby-Bundesliga.\nCompare to the 2014–15 season no team was promoted to the Bundesliga but five teams relegated from the league, TSV Victoria Linden, SG Siemensstadt/Grizzlies, Berliner SV 92 Rugby, RC Aachen and Heidelberger TV.\nBundesliga tables.\nNorth-East.\nThe final division table :\nSouth-West.\nThe final division table:\nPlay-off stage.\nChampionship.\nThe top two teams in each division qualified for the play-offs with the semi-finals held on 30 April and the final on 7 May 2016:\nDRV-Pokal.\nThe remaining twelve Bundesliga clubs not qualified for the championship play-off entered the DRV-Pokal, the premier rugby union cup competition in Germany.

        "title": "Keith Robertson (rugby union coach)",
        "text": "Keith Robertson (born in New Zealand) is a former head coach of Glasgow Rugby, now known as the Glasgow Warriors. He took over the club from fellow New Zealander Kevin Greene in November 1997 when it was felt that the head coach position should be a full-time post.\nPreviously a coach of Rugby Southland and an assistant coach of Otago Highlanders, Robertson applied for the Glasgow job when the Highlanders were on a tour of the UK. He was already earmarked as a potential candidate head coach by Jim Telfer in May 1997.\nThis was a difficult period for the fledgling professional rugby game in Scotland. During Robertson's tenure at the club the 4 districts of Scotland were merged into two. The Glasgow club merged with the Caledonia Reds to become known as the Glasgow Caledonians. Meanwhile, Edinburgh Rugby merged with the Border Reivers to become the Edinburgh Reivers.\nRobertson's philosophy was to learn with the players and belief was key. He stated \"When I come over I am not going to be saying to the boys that this or that is the way we do things in New Zealand, I fully expect that I will learn from Glasgow's players and they will tell me what they do. I enjoy motivating players to see what they can do more than dictating to them.\"\nHe also tried to put losses and rugby in perspective: \"A loss in sport is a loss, you pick yourself up, examine why you lost, and then go forward... Don't talk to me about sporting pressure. The bloke with no money in Drumchapel has more pressure than any rugby player.\"\nRobertson thought the Glasgow team in 1998 could have competed in the Super12 and won the European Cup. In the Heineken Cup of 1998–99 Glasgow recorded only 2 wins out of the 6 group games; the others of the group consisting of Pontypridd, Benetton Treviso and Colomiers.\nIt was thought that Robertson struggled to cope with merging the Glasgow and Caledonia Reds players into one team.\nHe was replaced by Richie Dixon in January 1999. Robertson moved to helping the Scotland Under 21 side with Roy Laidlaw but left at the end of the season.\nRobertson is now the coach of Clyde-Earnscleugh in New Zealand."

        "title": "Thomas Welsh (basketball)",
        "text": "Thomas Welsh (born February 3, 1996) is an American professional basketball player. He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins. As a senior in 2017–18, Welsh earned second-team all-conference honors in the Pac-12. He was selected by the Denver Nuggets in the second round of the 2018 NBA draft with the 58th overall pick.\nWelsh was a McDonald's All-American in high school. After leading UCLA in blocks as a freshman reserve, he was a member of the United States national team that won the gold medal at the FIBA Under-19 World Championship in 2015. He started for the Bruins as a sophomore and junior, leading the team in rebounds while also continuing to be their top shot blocker. As an NBA rookie, he played with Denver on a two-way contract.\nEarly life.\nWelsh was born in Torrance, California, in Los Angeles County, to Pat and Kathy Welsh as the eldest brother of Jack and Henry Welsh. At age five, he started playing basketball. He attended Loyola High School in Los Angeles. As a freshman, Welsh played basketball on the junior varsity team, where he was ranked eighth on the team's depth chart. He was promoted to the varsity team as a sophomore, moving up the depth chart to seventh. He did not become a starter until his junior year, by which time he had grown to . Still, he was only considered a prospect for mid-major colleges at the time, or perhaps a redshirt at a Pac-12 Conference school.\nThe following summer, Welsh performed well with the Los Angeles Rockfish, the longest ongoing high school all-star program in Southern California. He emerged as one of the top centers in California as a senior, and was selected for the 2014 McDonald's All-American Game, a rarity for a player who did not receive national recognition as a junior. He was rated as a four-star (on a scale of five) recruit.\nCollege career.\nFreshman.\nIn November 2013, Welsh committed to play at UCLA over fellow Pac-12 schools California and Stanford. As a freshman with the Bruins in 2014–15, he spent most of the season as a backup to junior Tony Parker. Welsh played in all 36 games, starting in three, and averaged 3.8 points and 3.8 rebounds per game. He led the team in blocks, averaging 1.1 per game as a reserve. He became the Bruins' first 7-foot player since Ryan Hollins in 2005–06. In the season opener against Montana State, Welsh scored 14 points in 13 minutes of play. He had six rebounds and four blocked shots in 22 minutes in an upset victory over SMU in UCLA's opening game of the 2015 NCAA tournament. Playing the final minutes of the game in place of Parker, he made a key block with 34 seconds remaining and UCLA down by four.\nSophomore.\nHaving played on the U.S. under-19 national team over the summer, Welsh's footwork and fundamentals improved. With Kevon Looney having moved on to the National Basketball Association (NBA), Welsh was promoted to UCLA's starting lineup at center, while Parker moved to forward. In the 2015–16 season opener, he had his first collegiate double-double with 12 points, 10 rebounds and a career-high five blocks in an 84–81 overtime loss to Monmouth. The blocks were the most by a Bruin since Travis Wear's five in 2012. In the following game, Welsh scored a career-high 22 on 10-for-12 shooting in an 88–83 win over Cal Poly. On December 3, against No. 1 Kentucky, he registered game highs of 21 points and 11 rebounds and outplayed highly touted Wildcats freshman Skal Labissière in an 87–77 upset win, the Bruins' first victory over a No. 1-ranked team since 2003. On January 9, 2016, he had a season-high 16 rebounds in an 81–74 win over Arizona State, which helped UCLA avoid falling to 1–3 in the Pac-12 for the first time in almost 20 years. After UCLA lost three of four games in mid-February, Welsh became a reserve after offering to coaches that Parker could take his place in the starting lineup; the senior Parker had been benched in favor of a quicker Jonah Bolden. The Bruins lost their final five games to finish with a 15–17 record. Welsh ended the season with an 11.2 scoring average, and led UCLA in field goal percentage (59.0), rebounding (8.5) and blocked shots (1.0). He ranked seventh in the Pac-12 in rebounding, second in offensive rebounds per game (3.2), and third in field goal percentage.\nJunior.\nUCLA began 2016–17 ranked No. 2 after starting 13–0, the first time they were undefeated in non-conference play since they won a national championship in 1994–95. Welsh was leading the Bruins in rebounding again, but had missed the last four games with a bruised right knee. He returned in the conference opener, but the Bruins suffered their first defeat in an 89–87 loss to No. 21 Oregon despite Welsh's 20 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks. On February 19, 2017, he scored 16 points and had a season-high 16 rebounds in a 102–70 win over their crosstown rivals, USC, ending a four-game losing streak against the Trojans. On February 25, Welsh scored 12 of his 14 points in the second half to lead No. 5 UCLA to a 77–72 win over No. 4 Arizona, which also snapped their conference rivals' 21-game home winning streak. In the Bruins' regular-season finale, he had 13 points and 11 rebounds and also made his first career three-point field goal in a 77–68 win over Washington State. The Bruins ended the season 31–5 after losing in the Sweet 16 of the 2017 NCAA tournament to Kentucky. For the season, Welsh averaged 10.8 points along with team highs of 8.7 rebounds and 1.3 blocks per game, and he received an honorable mention for the All-Pac-12 team. Although he was not listed in most mock drafts, he declared for the 2017 NBA draft. After attending the NBA Draft Combine but not hiring an agent, he withdrew his name from the draft to retain his college eligibility.\nSenior.\nOver the summer, Welsh worked on his three-point shooting based on feedback from his NBA workout with the Oklahoma City Thunder. He was the Bruins' lone returning starter in 2017-18. On December 9, 2017, he tied a career high with 22 points and added 10 rebounds in a 78–69 overtime loss to Michigan. On January 4, 2018, Welsh required three stitches after being bloodied by a hit to his nose. He was forced him to wear a protective mask after halftime, which affected his shooting as UCLA lost 107–99 in double overtime. He continued wearing a mask the following game, but adjusted for 19 points, 14 rebounds, and a career-high four three-pointers in a 107–84 win over Cal. On February 15, he played his first game without a mask since January and logged a career-high 17 rebounds along with 15 points in a 75–68 victory over Oregon State. In UCLA's Pac-12 tournament opener, Welsh had 18 points, 11 rebounds, and tied his career-high of four three-pointers in an 88–77 win over Stanford. The Bruins qualified for the 2018 NCAA tournament, but lost 65–58 to St. Bonaventure in the First Four for the Bonnies' first tournament win in 48 years. Welsh was limited to just two points, but had 15 rebounds to pass David Greenwood as the Bruins' third all-time leading rebounder, behind only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Walton.\nWelsh completed the season averaging 12.6 points and 10.8 rebounds. He made 40.2 percent (45-for-112) from 3-point range after attempting just one in his first three seasons. One of just two players along with Arizona's Deandre Ayton to average a double-double in the Pac-12, he earned second-team All-Pac-12 honors. The United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) voted him to their All-District IX Team, and he was a finalist for the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award, which recognizes the top center in Division I men's college basketball.\nProfessional career.\nDenver Nuggets (2018–2019).\nIn the 2018 NBA draft, Welsh was selected in the second round with the 58th overall pick by the Denver Nuggets. On July 19, 2018, Welsh was signed by the Nuggets to a two-way contract. Because the Nuggets were one of only three NBA teams to not have an NBA G League affiliate, Welsh was assigned to Washington Wizards affiliate Capital City Go-Go. Nuggets assistant coach Wes Unseld Jr. was impressed early by Welsh's constant talking—calling out coverages and directing teammates on the court—in spite of his youth and inexperience. Welsh made his NBA debut on October 17, 2018 against the Los Angeles Clippers, seeing under one minute of game action and scoring no points. On January 1, 2019, the Nuggets transferred Welsh from Capital City to the Iowa Wolves. On July 30, 2019, Welsh was waived by the Nuggets.\nGreensboro Swarm (2019–2020).\nOn August 9, 2019, Welsh signed with the Charlotte Hornets. He was waived during training camp in October, but joined their G League affiliate, the Greensboro Swarm, later in the month as an affiliate player. On January 17, 2020, he posted 22 points, 15 rebounds and four assists in a loss to the Fort Wayne Mad Ants. Welsh ended the season with averages of around 11 points and nine rebounds per game.\nFilou Oostende (2020–2021).\nOn August 31, 2020, Welsh signed with Filou Oostende of the Belgian Pro Basketball League.\nNew Taipei Kings (2021–2022).\nOn September 24, 2021, Welsh signed with New Taipei Kings of the Taiwan P. League+.\nNational team career.\nWelsh tried out for the United States national team in the 2014 FIBA Americas Under-18 Championship, but was one of the final three roster cuts. The following year after his first season with UCLA, he was one of 12 players selected by the U.S. to play at the 2015 FIBA Under-19 World Championship in Greece. He was not considered a top contender when tryouts began, but he made an impression with his rebounding and perimeter play. The Americans won the gold medal after a 79–71 win over Croatia. Welsh played in all seven games, averaging 2.7 points and 3.3 rebounds in 8.9 minutes."

The team is coached by Jerry York, '67, his twenty-second season behind the bench at Boston College. The Eagles play their home games at Kelley Rink on the campus of Boston College, competing in Hockey East.\nThe Eagles competed in two tournaments during the 2015–16 season, the first of which took place during the holiday break, the traditional tournament portion of the college hockey season. The 15th Annual Florida College Hockey Classic, played on December 28 and 29 at Germain Arena in Estero, Florida showcased the Eagles playing Ohio State in the first round, as well as Providence versus host Cornell. The Eagles fell to the Friars of Providence 2–1 in the consolation round, having lost to eventual Harkness Cup winner Ohio State 3–2 in the first round. Boston College previously played in and won the Florida College Hockey Classic in 2004. On February 1 and 8, the Eagles played in the 64th Annual Beanpot Tournament at the TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts, defeating Harvard 3–2 in the first round and winning the title by defeating Boston University 1–0 in overtime of the championship. They reclaimed the Beanpot trophy after missing the championship match in 2015, having previously won five titles in a row from 2010 to 2014.\nThe Eagles finished the season 28–8–5, and 15–2–5 in conference play, capturing a share of the Hockey East regular season title, splitting the title with Providence. They advanced to the semifinals of the Hockey East tournament, but lost to Beanpot rival Northeastern, who would eventually win the Hockey East championship for the first time since 1988. They Eagles fared well in the NCAA Tournament as well, where they would win the Northeast Regional, played at the DCU Center in Worcester. After dispatching Harvard in the first round and closely defeating Minnesota-Duluth in the regional final, the Eagles earned a ticket to the program's 25th Frozen Four in Tampa, Florida (an NCAA record for most appearances). There, however, they fell to Quinnipiac 2–3, who advanced to play in the national title game. There, the Bobcats fell to champions North Dakota, 5–1.\nPrevious season recap.\nThe Eagles entered the 2015–16 season following a first round loss to Denver in the NCAA tournament, and a quarterfinals loss to Vermont in the Hockey East Tournament. The Eagles did capture one trophy during the 2014–15 season, winning the Ledyard Bank Classic with a 3–2 victory over Dartmouth, and finished with a strong 21–14–3 record and 12–7–3 in conference play. They failed to defend their Beanpot title for the first time in six seasons, but picked up the consolation win with a 3–2 victory over Harvard. Noah Hanifin led the way for the Eagles as a freshman, earning All-Second Team honors in Hockey East, while fellow freshman Alex Tuch, who was the team's leading point-scorer, earned a spot on the All-Rookie team.\nOffseason.\nSeven Senior Eagles graduated in May: Assistant Captain Michael Sit – F, Assistant Captain Quinn Smith – F, Destry Straight – F, Cam Spiro – F. Danny Linell – F, Brian Billett – G, and Brad Barone – G.\nJunior defenseman Mike Matheson decided to forgo his senior year of eligibility to enter the NHL, signing with his drafted team, the Florida Panthers.\nSenior defensemen Teddy Doherty was named Captain, with Juniors Steven Santini, Chris Calnan, and Ian McCoshen named Assistant Captains for the 2015–16 season.\nOn June 26, freshman defenseman Noah Hanifin was drafted 5th overall by the Carolina Hurricanes in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. He signed an entry-level contract with the Hurricanes on July 11, forgoing the rest of his NCAA eligibility.\nOn September 22, graduated forward Quinn Smith signed with the Idaho Steelheads of the ECHL.\nAlso in the offseason, graduated forward Destry Straight signed with the Rapid City Rush and graduated goalie Brad Barone with the Elmira Jackals, both of the ECHL.\nRecruiting.\nBoston College added nine freshmen for the 2015–16 season: six forwards, two defensemen, and a goalie.\nMidseason Additions.\nIn addition to the nine players recruited at the start of the season, the Eagles added two early enrollees to the program who accelerated their arrival to the school. Defenseman Michael Kim and goalie Ian Milosz both played for the Boston Junior Bruins of the USPHL before arriving at Boston College for the second semester. Kim first dressed on December 29, 2015, and Milosz started in his first appearance on January 8, 2016, both games being against Providence College.\nCharlie Van Kula was also added as an additional backup goaltender; he had been a team manager for the previous two seasons and had played at St. Joseph's Prep before attending Boston College.\n2015–2016 roster.\n2015–16 Eagles.\nAs of January 9, 2016.\n&lt;section end=roster /&gt;\nSchedule.\nRegular season.\n!colspan=12 style=\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"| Hockey East Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"| NCAA Tournament\nAwards and honors.\nHobey Baker Award\nMike Richter Award\nAHCA Division I All-Americans\nHockey East Awards\nHockey East All Stars\nNCAA Rookie of the Month\nHockey East Goaltender of the Month\nHockey East Rookie of the Month\nNCAA Three Stars of the Week\nHockey East Player of the Week\nHockey East Rookie of the Week\nHockey East Defensive Player of the Week"

        "text": "The Vanuatu women's national cricket team represents the country of Vanuatu in international women's cricket. It is organised by the game's governing body in the country, the Vanuatu Cricket Association (VCA), which is an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC).\nHaving made its international debut the previous year, against Fiji, Vanuatu first participated in an international tournament at the 2012 ICC East Asia-Pacific regional qualifiers for the World Twenty20, winning two matches and placing fourth out of six teams. At the 2014 edition of the same tournament, they finished last, with only a single win (against the Cook Islands). Vanuatu's next major event was the women's tournament at the 2015 Pacific Games in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.\nIn April 2018, the ICC granted full Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Vanuatu women and any ICC member since 1 July 2018 have the full WT20I status.\nHistory.\n\"Traditional cricket\", similar to the \"kilikiti\" played in Samoa, has long been popular amongst Ni-Vanuatu women, but the standard version of the sport was only popularised in the late 2000s, with the backing of the Vanuatu Cricket Association (VCA) and the ICC East Asia-Pacific development programme. Vanuatu made its international debut in April 2011, hosting a tri-series against Fiji and a team from the North Coast region of the Australian state of New South Wales. In May 2012, the country hosted the 2012 East Asia-Pacific Women's Championship. The tournament was played using the Twenty20 format, with the winner progressing to the 2013 World Twenty20 Qualifier in Ireland. Vanuatu joined the three teams from the previous 2010 tournament – Japan, Papua New Guinea, and Samoa – as well as the Cook Islands and Fiji. In the round-robin stage, Vanuatu recorded wins against Fiji and the Cook Islands, finishing fourth in the table. In the third-place playoff against Samoa, they lost by eight wickets.\nAt the 2014 EAP Women's Championship in Japan (a qualifier for the 2015 World Twenty20 Qualifier), Vanuatu again placed fourth in the group stages, though out of five rather than six teams (Fiji having dropped out). Their only win in the round-robin was by eight runs against the Cook Islands, but they were unable to repeat that in the fifth-place playoff, losing by six wickets. In April 2015, the New Caledonian national women's team toured Vanuatu, playing six matches against Vanuatu in Port Vila. The tour was part of both sides' preparation for the women's tournament at the 2015 Pacific Games in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. Vanuatu also played against a mixed men and women's side from the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) in the lead-up to the games.\nIn December 2020, the ICC announced the qualification pathway for the 2023 ICC Women's T20 World Cup. Vanuatu were named in the 2021 ICC Women's T20 World Cup EAP Qualifier regional group, alongside seven other teams.\nCurrent squad.\nThis lists all the players who played for Vanuatu in the past 12 months or were named in the most recent squad. \n\"Updated on 8 September 2023.\"\nRecords and statistics.\nInternational Match Summary — Vanuatu Women\n\"Last updated 1 May 2024\"\nTwenty20 International.\nMost T20I runs for Vanuatu Women\nMost T20I wickets for Vanuatu Women\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to WT20I #1865.

FC Barcelona Lassa was the defending champion.\nVive Tauron Kielce defeated MVM Veszprém in the final to capture their first title.\nOverview.\nTeam allocation.\nTwenty-seven teams were directly qualified for the group stage.\nCompetition format.\nIn March 2014, EHF introduced a new competition format.\nTwenty-eight teams participated in the competition, divided in four groups. Groups A and B played with eight teams each, in a round robin, home and away format. The top team in each group qualified directly for the quarter-finals, the bottom two in each group dropped out of the competition and the remaining 10 teams qualified for the first knock-out phase.\nIn groups C and D, six teams played in each group in a round robin format, playing both home and away. The top two teams in each group then met in a 'semi-final' play-off, with the two winners going through to the first knock-out phase. The remaining teams dropped out of the competition.\n12 teams played home and away in the first knock-out phase, with the 10 teams qualified from groups A and B and the two teams qualified from groups C and D.\nThe six winners of the matches in the first knock-out phase joined with the winners of groups A and B to play home and away for the right to play in the VELUX EHF FINAL4.\nThe culmination of the season, the VELUX EHF FINAL4, with the four top teams from the competition competing for the title.\nRound and draw dates.\nAll draws held at the European Handball Federation headquarters in Vienna, Austria.\nQualification stage.\nThere was no draw held. The four teams played a semifinal and final to determine the last participant. Matches were played on 5 and 6 September 2015. RK Banja Luka organized the tournament.\nBracket.\n\"All times are local (UTC+2).\"\nGroup stage.\nThe draw for the group stage was held on 26 June 2015, 20:00 CEST, in the Vienna city centre. The 28 teams were drawn into four groups, two containing eight teams (Groups A and B) and two containing six teams (Groups C and D). The only restriction was that teams from the same national association could not face each other in the same group. Since Germany qualified three teams, the lowest seeded side (Flensburg-Handewitt) had necessarily to be drawn with one of the other two.\nIn each group, teams played against each other in a double round-robin format, with home and away matches. The matchdays are 16–20 September, 23–27 September, 30 September–4 October, 7–11 October, 14–18 October, 21–25 October, 11–15 November, 18–22 November, 25–29 November and 2–6 December 2015. For Groups A and B, additional matchdays include 10–14 February, 17–21 February, 24–28 February and 2–6 March 2016.\nAfter completion of the group stage matches, the teams advancing to the knockout stage were determined in the following manner:\nKnockout stage.\nThe first-place team from the preliminary groups A and B advanced to the quarterfinals, while the second through sixth place teams advanced to the round 16 alongside the playoff winners.\nTop goalscorers.\nStatistics exclude qualifying rounds.\nAwards.\nThe All-star team of the Champions League 2015/16:"

        "title": "Cook Islands women's national cricket team",
        "text": "The Cook Islands women's national cricket team represents the Cook Islands, an associated state of New Zealand, in international women's cricket. It is organised by the sport's governing body in the country, the Cook Islands Cricket Association (CICA), which has been an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 2000.\nThe Cook Islands made its international debut at the 2012 ICC East Asia-Pacific regional qualifiers for the World Twenty20, but lost every match, finishing last. They improved slightly at the 2014 edition, winning a single match (against Vanuatu) and placing fourth out of five teams. In April 2018, the ICC granted full Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between the Cook Islands women and another international side since 1 July 2018 have been full WT20Is.\nHistory.\nUnlike in many other Pacific island countries, where women's cricket has been played alongside the men's game, women's cricket was only introduced to the Cook Islands in 2009. A high-performance program was established in the same year, with assistance from ICC East Asia-Pacific (EAP) and a New Zealand provincial governing body, the Northern Districts Cricket Association. The sport quickly gained in popularity amongst Cook Islander women, with significant numbers of clubs established in only a few years – in April 2014, it was reported that there were 600 female participants in the sport, out of a total population of 8,000 women. At the 2012 ICC EAP Development Programme Awards, the Cook Islands Cricket Association won the award for \"Best Women's Cricket Initiative\".\nWith earlier applications to participate in regional tournaments having been declined, the Cook Islands made its international debut at the 2012 EAP Women's Championship in Port Vila, Vanuatu. That tournament was played using the Twenty20 format, with the winner progressing to the 2013 World Twenty20 Qualifier in Ireland. The team joined the three sides from the 2010 tournament – Japan, Papua New Guinea, and Samoa – as well as Fiji and Vanuatu (also making their tournament debut). The Cook Islands lost all three of its group-stage matches by large margins, and eventually placed last after losing to Fiji in the fifth-place playoff. In the opening game against Samoa, they were bowled out for 36 from 12.1 overs, while against PNG they were all out for 47 from 17.3 overs.\nIn 2014, the Cook Islanders played several exhibition matches against club teams touring the islands from New Zealand, and were consequently invited to the 2014 EAP Women's Championship, despite their poor performance at the previous edition. The winner of that tournament was to qualify for the 2015 World Twenty20 Qualifier in Thailand. Despite fielding a young team, including four players under the age of 18, the Cook Islands dramatically improved upon its 2012 result, defeating Vanuatu in the fourth-place playoff by six wickets after bowling them out for 73. However, they were unable to win the subsequent third-place playoff against Samoa, and in the earlier group stages had lost all of their games. The Cook Islands' next major tournament is the women's event at the 2015 Pacific Games in Port Moresby.\nIn December 2020, the ICC announced the qualification pathway for the 2023 ICC Women's T20 World Cup. The Cook Islands were named in the 2021 ICC Women's T20 World Cup EAP Qualifier regional group, alongside seven other teams; however, due to COVID-19, the tournament did not go ahead. The Cook Islands have been named as participants in the 2023 ICC Women's T20 World Cup EAP Qualifier, which will mark their debut in an ICC pathway event.\nRecords and statistics.\nInternational Match Summary — Cook Islands Women\n\"Last updated 21 January 2024\"\nTwenty20 International.\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to WT20I #1741.

It is the second most prestigious title in the discipline after the 200 metres at the Olympics. The competition format typically has two or three qualifying rounds leading to a final between eight athletes.\nThe championship records for the event are 19.19 seconds for men, set by Usain Bolt in 2009, and 21.41 seconds for women, set by Shericka Jackson in 2023. The men's world record has been broken at the competition on one occasion, and Bolt's championship record set in 2009 remains the world record as of 2015. The women's world record has never been broken at the competition.\nUsain Bolt is the most successful athlete of the event, having won four successive titles from 2009 to 2015, and also a silver in 2007. Allyson Felix is the most successful woman, having won three straight titles (2005 to 2009). Two-time champion Merlene Ottey has won more medals in the 200 m than any other athlete, reaching the podium six times in a period stretching from 1983 to 1997. Calvin Smith and Michael Johnson are the only others to have won two world titles over the distance.\nThe United States is the most successful nation in the discipline, with twelve gold medals among a total of 31. Jamaica is the next most successful with seventeen medals and seven titles. East Germany and the Netherlands, with two golds, are the only other nations to have provided multiple gold medallists.\nDoping.\nThe first instances of doping bans affecting the 200 m at the World Championships came at the 2001 edition. The champion Marion Jones was stripped of her gold medal and bronze medalist Kelli White met the same fate. Debbie Ferguson, the sole remaining original medalist, was elevated to the gold medal. A third female athlete, Yekaterina Leshchova who ran in the heats, was also disqualified for doping. The first male doping disqualifications happened the same year, with quarter-finalists Christophe Cheval and Ramon Clay being the offenders. Doping persisted at the 2003 World Championships – White was the champion that year and her retrospective ban also affected this result. The 1997 champion Zhanna Block, fourth in 2003, was also disqualified. Anastasiya Kapachinskaya (herself banned for steroids in 2004) was promoted to the position of 2003 world champion.\nThe next 200 m athlete to be disqualified for doping was Ruqaya Al-Ghasra (a competitor in the heats only). Two positive drug tests were recorded by 200 m athletes at the 2013 World Championships in Athletics: Yelena Ryabova, who ran in the heats, and semi-finalist Yelyzaveta Bryzhina."

Eight players participated in the derby in a bracket-style, single-elimination timed event. Each player had five minutes to hit as many home runs as possible. Hitters were also awarded bonus time for hitting long home runs. Hitters were awarded an additional minute if they hit two home runs over 420 feet and an additional 30 seconds if they hit a home run over 475 feet. Hitters were also allowed one 45 second \"timeout\" to stop the clock. Flex balls came into play during the final minute (bonus time included); any homer meant a $10,000 donation by Gillette &amp; MLB.\nThe eight competing players were seeded 1-8 based on their home run totals as of July 7. The higher seed hit second in any round, and the round ended if the higher seed surpassed the total of the first hitter. In the event of a tie, the two hitters competed in a 90-second swing-off (with no timeouts nor bonus time awarded). If there remained a tie, the hitters engaged in three swing-off rounds; thereafter, sudden-death swing-off rounds until a winner was determined.\nFurther rule changes.\nDue to the threat of rain, changes were announced to the Home Run Derby rules."

Staying there from 2004 to 2008, he was selected on the SIAC First Team, named SIAC men's basketball MVP and earned a Division II All-America honourable mention for his senior season.\nProfessional career.\nHe stayed in Kentucky after graduating, signing with the ABA's Kentucky Bisons. He spent two seasons with the Bisons, winning the ABA in 2009 and earning All-Star honours in 2008–09 and 2009–10.\nHe then spent the 2010–11 with another Kentucky team, the Bluegrass Stallions of the Premier Basketball League.\nThe American moved to Germany in 2011, playing the 2011–12 1. Regionalliga Südost (third division) season with the Dachau Spurs.\nHis next stop was in the Chilean Dimayor with Tinguiririca San Fernando, playing the 2012 season from September, to November when his team lost in the playoff semifinals.\nOn 24 January 2013, Jones signed with the Saint John Mill Rats of the National Basketball League of Canada (NBL Canada). \nHe debuted that same day against the Moncton Miracles, scoring 25 points and grabbing 6 rebounds. Averaging 22.7 points and 8.4 rebounds per game in the 17 games he played, he earned Player of the Week honours for the week ending 17 March 2013.\nHe added a selection to the NBL Canada All-Playoff Team at the end of the season, and was also nominated for the All-Star Game in April but he had left the country by that time.\nMeanwhile, he had joined Trigueros de Ciudad Obregón in the Mexican regional Circuito de Baloncesto de la Costa del Pacífico (CIBACOPA) for the 2013 season lasting from April to July. He finished as league top scorer with over 25 points per game, also making the league All-Star Game.\nHis next stop was in the Argentinian second division TNA, as he signed with Instituto Atlético Central Córdoba in September 2013.\nAt the end of the season in May 2014, he was selected by Latinbasket.com as their choice for the league's best player and import player of the year.\nJones re-signed with Saint John in September 2014.\nHe was named to the All-NBL Canada Team at the end of the 2014–15 season. \nHe helped the Mill Rats reach the playoff semifinals, but was powerless to prevent them from losing the series to the Island Storm, despite scoring 28 points and grabbing a game-high 11 rebounds in the decisive game.\nThe Mill Rats placed Jones on their protected list in late May, meaning no other NBL Canada team can approach him for contract negotiations before the start of training camp for the 2015–16 NBL Canada season.\nHaving been selected in the second round of the 2015 CIBACOPA draft by Fuerza Guinda de Nogales, Jones joined the team from May to play another season in the Mexican league. \nHe had averages of 20.1 points and 7.4 rebounds for Fuerza Guinda, helping the team reach the championship finals, but they were punished 56–80 by the Tijuana Zonkeys in game 7 on 24 July 2015 to concede the title, with Jones posting a team high 15 points.

As part of the coaching set-up Sean Lineen joined him as assistant coach and Shade Munro became a development coach.\nCampbell initially got the Glasgow side back to playing rugby the players enjoyed. Glasgow started the 2003-04 season with a confident win over Cardiff Blues. They were however very inconsistent and Glasgow finished 2nd bottom of the table sandwiched by Edinburgh above and the Border Reivers below.\nThe 2004-05 season saw Glasgow in 7th place in the table and was the best showing from a Scottish side that season. However that season's mid table push was the best in Campbell's reign in charge.\nThe Glasgow Rugby side finally rebranded itself as Glasgow Warriors in 2005.\nThe 2004-05 impetus gradually disappeared from the Warriors the following season and they managed just 4 wins in the Celtic League in 2005-06. Attendances dropped with the erratic performances and the number of players selected for Scotland international duty also fell. Finally the chief executive of the SRU Gordon McKie stepped in to resolve the situation.\nCampbell was replaced as Warriors boss by his assistant Sean Lineen on 28 March 2006. With the season almost over Lineen could do little to stop the Warriors finishing bottom of the Magners League."

The DLSU Lady Spikers are hailed as the most dominant women's volleyball team in the UAAP for the last 2 decades (and Final Four era) having won 12 championships, 8 silver finishes, and a bronze to further cement the 27-year helm of the \"Living Legend\" Coach Ramil de Jesus of the DLSU Lady Spikers.\nHistory.\nThe Lady Spikers were the first NCAA women's champions in volleyball when the tournament was introduced in NCAA Season 51 (1975–76). The first UAAP title of the team came in Season 62 (2000). They then won the UAAP title in 2004, 2005, 2006 (as 3-peat champions), 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013 (as 3-peat champions), and 2016, 2017, 2018 (as 3-peat champions), and 2023. They have won a total of twelve (12) titles in the UAAP all under Coach Ramil de Jesus. The Lady Spikers hold the distinction of having appeared in the Finals for ten consecutive times from UAAP Seasons 71 to 80 (2009–2018) which is the longest streak in the Final Four era of the UAAP.\nThe Lady Spikers are also 4-peat Champions of the PVF National Inter-Collegiate Volleyball Tournament nailing the 8th, 9th, 10th &amp; 11th editions of the tournament. They have also won three successive Shakey's V-League titles – Second Conference of Season 1 in 2004, First Conference of Season 2 in 2005, and First Conference of Season 3 in 2006.\nIn 2009 the Lady Spikers soared high as they emerged champions in the UAAP, overpowering the 2007 champions, FEU. 2009 Lady Spikers' captain, Manilla Santos was the MVP.\nIn 2010–2011, the Lady Spikers, powered by stalwarts Abigail Maraño, Michele Gumabao, Charleen Cruz (team captain), Stephanie Mercado and Season MVP Jacqueline Alarca, edged out the UST Tigresses in Game 2 of the Season 73 Finals. Cruz was the Finals MVP.\nIn 2011–2012, the Lady Spikers swept the elimination round to earn an automatic finals berth and a 1-game advantage in the Finals. After losing their first game in the season in Game 1, the Lady Spikers led by Season MVP Maraño, Gumabao and prized rookies Mika Reyes and Ara Galang defeated the Ateneo Lady Eagles in Games 2 and 3 (winning Game 3 against the Ateneo Lady Eagles in 3 straight sets). Graduating team captain Charleen Cruz was hailed the Most Valuable player of the Finals for the second straight year (Season 73 and 74).\nIn 2012–2013, after an opening day loss to the UST Golden Tigresses, the Lady Spikers won the rest of their elimination round games to finish with a 13–1 win-loss card. In the Final Four, the Lady Spikers defeated the NU Lady Bulldogs in 3 straight sets to advance to the finals facing rival Ateneo Lady Eagles. In Game 1 of the best of 3 Finals, the Lady Eagles started strong and led 2–0 but the Lady Spikers regained their bearings and came back to win the last 3 sets and win Game 1 despite committing 48 unforced errors. In Game 2, the Lady Spikers, with the leadership of Season MVP and best blocker Aby Maraño together with co-MVP Ara Galang, Mika Reyes, Michele Gumabao, Melissa Gohing, Wensh Tiu, Mika Esperenza, Kim Fajardo and Cyd Demecillo, once again crushed the Ateneo Lady Eagles, handing them their 13th straight loss against the mighty Lady Spikers, 3 sets to none, giving La Salle its eighth UAAP championship and its second 3-peat feat. Gumabao was chosen as Finals MVP.\nIn the 2013–2014 season, with the goal of capturing a 4-peat title and their 9th UAAP championship in mind, La Salle made a remarkable second 14–0 win-loss eliminations record, making them the first women's volleyball team to achieve the feat, and once again showed no mercy to Ateneo, winning the elimination games against the Katipunan-based female squad. DLSU then got the number 1 spot after defeating every team on its way. The Lady Spikers got the thrice-to-beat advantage, establishing the longest winning streak in UAAP history (standing at 30 games, since its second game during the Season 75 eliminations round, up to the final eliminations game in Season 76). DLSU, however, lost to their nemesis Ateneo (in their third consecutive season matchup for the championship) 3 games to 1 (despite La Salle's 1–0 incentive lead for the tournament's best-of-five championship round), giving the Lady Eagles their first title ever since they joined the UAAP, ending 36 years of drought. The UAAP Season 76 women's volleyball finals series is notable for being the longest championship series in the league's history (lasting 5 games after the Ateneo Lady Eagles overcame La Salle's thrice-to-beat advantage in the 5-set thriller Game 3), with La Salle being the first ever UAAP varsity team to gain an automatic finals berth as top seed but losing to a lower-seed team in the championship series in the 2008 to the present form of the UAAP's Final Four playoffs format era.\nIn 2016, after a heart breaking loss the previous season without Ara Galang in the finals, they finished with an 11–3 win-loss elimination record, starting strong in the elimination round and even ending the Ateneo Lady Eagles’ 24-match winning streak. DLSU then got the number 2 spot entering the Final Four with a twice-to-beat-advantage, but lost to the FEU Lady Tamaraws in game 1 (a 5-set thriller). The Lady Spikers regained their composure as they won in 3 straight sets in Game 2 to advance to the finals facing rival Ateneo Lady Eagles for the 5th consecutive year. In Game 1 of the best of 3 Finals, the Ateneo Lady Eagles started strong and led early but the Lady Spikers regained their bearings and finished to win Game 1 in 3 straight. In Game 2, the Katipunan-based squad rallied from a 0–2 deficit to win in 5 sets with the help of their leading scorer Alyssa Valdez with 34 points. In Game 3, the Lady Spikers, powered by Best Setter Kim Fajardo together with graduating seniors Ara Galang, Mika Reyes, Cyd Demecillo, Mika Esperanza and Carol Cerveza, and juniors Kim Dy, best blocker Majoy Baron and best digger and best receiver Dawn Macandili, dethroned the Ateneo Lady Eagles, 3 sets to 1, to win their ninth UAAP championship. Kianna Dy was selected as Finals MVP.\nIn 2017, the Lady Spikers finished with an 11–3 win-loss elimination record gaining a twice to beat advantage in the Final Four Series. The Lady Spikers faced the Lady Tigresses and won in four sets bringing them to another finals appearance against arch rival ADMU Lady Eagles. The Lady Spikers were able to sweep the Best of Three Finals Series winning in four sets in Game 1 and five sets in Game 2, making them back-to-back champions. Kim Fajardo was awarded UAAP Season 79 Best Setter and Best Server, Dawn Macandili was awarded with UAAP Season 79 Best Receiver and Majoy Baron as UAAP Season 79 MVP. Desiree Cheng was named the Finals MVP. In 2018, the Lady Spikers achieved their third 3-peat after sweeping FEU in the Finals. Dawn Macandili was awarded the Finals MVP.\nIn 2023, the Lady Spikers won their 12th UAAP championship title in the Season 85 women's volleyball tournament. Angel Canino became the second rookie to be named Season MVP and Rookie of the Year after Mhicaela Belen, and Marionne Alba was named Finals MVP.\nIn the girls' division, the Junior Lady Spikers represented by De La Salle-Zobel, have won a league best ten (10) titles which include a 5-peat from UAAP Seasons 57 to 61 and a 3-peat from Seasons 73 to 75. Junior Lady Spiker stalwarts Kim Kianna Dy and Juniors MVP Andie Narciso matched the 3-peat feat of their senior counterparts. In UAAP Season 81, the Junior Lady Spikers won their 10th championship and ended NU's four-year reign.\nRecord.\nUniversity Athletic Association of the Philippines.\nThe DLSU Women's Volleyball Team was formed in 1975 when the women's volleyball tournament was introduced in NCAA Season 51, then later moved to the UAAP in 1986 (Season 49) when De La Salle University was admitted into the league."

        "title": "The Basketball Tournament",
        "text": "The Basketball Tournament (TBT) is an open-application, single-elimination tournament played each summer in the United States. The most recent 2023 edition featured 64 teams with a $1 million winner-take-all prize, broadcast by ESPN. TBT was founded in 2014 by Jonathan Mugar.\nFormat.\nTeams in TBT are arranged by the general manager, sometimes based on which college basketball program the players competed for. The tournament has had as many as 97 teams, in 2015, and as few as 24 teams, in 2020. Since 2016, the tournament has most often used a 64-team field. In 2019, the 64 teams were divided into eight regions, with each regional winner advancing to the championship venue. In 2020, the tournament field was reduced to 24 teams with all games played at a single venue, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. In 2021, the 64 teams were organized into four regions, with each region's top two teams advancing to the championship venue. The 2022 event returned to the former eight-region format, with the eight regional winners advancing to what TBT organizers call \"Championship Week\", with quarterfinals at two sites followed by semifinals and the final at the championship venue.\nThe championship prize money was originally $500,000 in 2014, was increased to $1 million in 2015, and was $2 million from 2016 through 2019. Since 2020, the top prize has been $1 million. The prize money goes to the winning team's personnel.\nThere are also prizes for the top 1,000 bracket entries submitted by fans that score the most points through their picks, on a deescalating scale starting at $4,000 for the winner. The 2019 tournament included prizes other than the overall winner-take-all purse; each regional winner received 25% of its region's ticket proceeds.\n Defending champion received a play-in to the round-of-16&lt;br&gt;\n Four teams in the field of 64 select via a 16-team two-round play-in\nRules.\nTBT uses a modified version of NCAA men's basketball rules. As of the 2019 edition, the most significant exceptions were:\nPlayers.\nTBT has had a number of current and former NBA players participate, including Hakim Warrick, Jason Williams, Dahntay Jones, Mike Bibby, Royal Ivey, Matt Bonner, Jimmer Fredette, and Brian Scalabrine. Former WNBA player Nikki Teasley played in the 2014 tournament. The 2018 tournament included the basketball return of Greg Oden, who last played in the Chinese Basketball Association during their 2015–16 season. The 2019 tournament had been expected to be the first to feature an active female professional. Megan Gustafson, who had been cut by the Dallas Wings before the 2019 WNBA season, was slated to play for Iowa United, a team made up primarily of alumni of the state's four NCAA Division I schools. However, due to a rash of early-season injuries on the team, the Wings re-signed her in mid-June, ruling her out of TBT.\nMany teams feature professional players reunited under a former college or university name, with teams representing Arkansas, Bellarmine, Bradley, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Dayton, Georgetown, Gonzaga, Iowa State, Kansas State, Louisville, Marquette, Miami, Marshall, Milwaukee, New Mexico, North Texas, Notre Dame, Ohio State, Purdue, Seton Hall, Syracuse, Texas Tech, UCLA, VCU, West Virginia, Wichita State, Xavier and many others. Teams have received fan support from active NBA players such as Kyle Lowry and Obi Toppin. Five alumni teams have won TBT—Buffalo, Marquette, Notre Dame, Ohio State, and Syracuse.\nIn 2016, NBA players such as John Wall, Kristaps Porzingis, Rudy Gay, Shaun Livingston, Chandler Parsons, and Austin Rivers served as boosters for different teams. In 2017, Carmelo Anthony acted as host for the tournament in Baltimore, where he played high school basketball. 2019 saw even more NBA involvement, with Chris Paul (Team CP3) and DeMarcus Cousins (Loyalty Is Love) both entering teams, while Bobby Portis and Andre Drummond coached TBT sides.\nBracket celebration.\nAt the conclusion of each game, the winning team advances its placard on a giant bracket to the next round. The bracket resembles the All Valley Karate Tournament bracket found in \"The Karate Kid\".\nAfter pleas from ESPN analyst Fran Fraschilla, Yahoo Sports columnist Jeff Eisenberg, and SportsCenter host Scott Van Pelt, the NCAA adopted the ritual for March Madness in 2018. After the game, a portable bracket was brought into the winning team's locker room. One player, or a group of players, advanced the team to the next round. Oftentimes, the celebration was posted on social media. The bracket celebration also took place in the Frozen Four of the 2018 NCAA Hockey Tournament.\nChampions.\nOn June 28, 2014, Notre Dame Fighting Alumni won the inaugural TBT championship, defeating Team Barstool, 72–68. The winning team, represented by several former Fighting Irish players, including MVP Tyrone Nash, donated $40,000 to Coaches vs. Cancer.\nOn August 2, 2015, Overseas Elite defeated Team 23, 67–65, to take the second annual TBT title. D. J. Kennedy, who played college basketball for St. John's, was named MVP.\nOverseas Elite was able to repeat as TBT champions by defeating Team Colorado, 77–72, on August 2, 2016, to claim the $2 million prize; Arizona alumnus Kyle Fogg was named MVP.\nOn August 3, 2017, Overseas Elite beat Team Challenge ALS, 86–83, to become three-time TBT champions, with Fogg again being named MVP.\nOn August 3, 2018, Overseas Elite won their fourth consecutive final, defeating Eberlein Drive, 70–58, with D. J. Kennedy being named MVP for the second time.\nThe 2019 final was played on August 6 and pitted the Marquette alumni team, Golden Eagles, against Ohio State alumni team Carmen's Crew, whom had defeated the reigning four-time champion Overseas Elite to advance to the final. Carmen's Crew went on to defeat Golden Eagles, 66–60. William Buford of Carmen's Crew was named MVP.\nThe 2020 final, played on July 14 in Columbus, Ohio, matched Golden Eagles, appearing in their second consecutive TBT title game, and Sideline Cancer, defeating Overseas Elite to appear in their first. The game was won by Golden Eagles, 78–73. Darius Johnson-Odom of the Golden Eagles was named MVP.\nThe 2021 final was held on August 3 in Dayton, Ohio, with Boeheim's Army (Syracuse) defeating Team 23, 69–67; the winning shot was made by Keifer Sykes. Team 23 became the first team to lose two TBT finals. Tyrese Rice of Boeheim's Army was named MVP.\nThe 2022 final was held on August 2, again in Dayton, between Blue Collar U (Buffalo) and Autism Army. Blue Collar U outscored Autism Army in every quarter and won the game, 89–67. The winning points came on a dunk by Montell McRae. C. J. Massinburg of Blue Collar U was named MVP.\nChampionship game records.\nTeams are ordered by number of appearances.\nRelated venture.\nOn October 11, 2022, tournament owner and organizer TBT Enterprises announced that it would extend the TBT concept to soccer, announcing The Soccer Tournament, a 7-on-7 summer tournament that began on schedule in 2023. Like TBT, TST has a winner-take-all prize of $1 million. TST started with 32 teams, with a group phase followed by a 16-team knockout tournament.\nMatches are played on a reduced-size field with slightly smaller goals than normal and consist of 20-minute halves. The Elam Ending has been adapted to a soccer setting; after the end of the second half, the remainder of the match consists of \"Target Score Time\", with the target score being set by adding one goal to the leading (or tied) team's score. The game ends once the target score is reached by either team. If the target is not reached after 5 minutes, one player from each team exits the field, with the process continuing every 5 minutes until each side is reduced to 2 players or the winning goal is scored, whichever comes first."

        "text": "Henry \"Norkey\" Dewar (13October 18839August 1915) was a New Zealand rugby union forward, who played for the All Blacks, and represented Taranaki and Wellington provinces.\nPlaying for the Melrose Club in Wellington, he was selected in 1908 for the provincial team that played and defeated the Anglo-Welsh team on tour in New Zealand. After moving to Taranaki in 1910, he was soon selected to represent the province. Coming close to winning the Ranfurly Shield in 1912, a subsequent challenge the following year was successful against the longtime holders Auckland. He earned selection to the North Island team for the annual Inter-Island match and thereafter was picked to play for the All Blacks, first to play Australia and then for the tour of North America, in which he played 14 of the 16 games, including the 51–3 defeat of the All America team.\nSoon after the British Empire declared war on Germany on 5August 1914, Dewar signed up to the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, and took part in the expedition to occupy German Samoa, departing the day after he played for Taranaki defending a challenge from Wairarapa. On his return, he volunteered again for active service and enlisted in the Wellington Mounted Rifles, joining the machine gun section. After promotion to sergeant, he departed in October for Egypt. There, he captained his regiment's rugby team in matches against other New Zealand and Australian regiments. He landed at Anzac Cove on 8August 1915 and participated in the action to capture Chunuk Bair in the Gallipoli Campaign. The following day he was killed in action.\nEarly life.\nHenry Dewar, born 13 October 1883 in Foxton, New Zealand, was the son of Alexander and Lydia Dewar. He spent most of his early years in Wellington until moving to Taranaki in 1910 where he worked as an iron moulder for B. Harkness of Stratford.\nRugby career.\nDewar first played for the Melrose Club in Wellington and was selected for Wellington province in 1907. In 1908, he was a member of the Wellington team that defeated the touring Anglo-Welsh 19–13 on 27May. The visitors played much of the game with fourteen players, only six forwards, after an injury in the first half: the captains, before the game, had agreed that there would be no substitutions for injury. Dewar and Rush, in particular, as well as Harding and Cracroft Wilson, bore the \"heat and burden of a truly Homeric struggle.\"\nLater in the year, on 15August, he took part in a Ranfurly Shield challenge, which resulted in a heavy 24–3 defeat for Wellington at the hands of Auckland. The challengers, away to Auckland, were the underdogs but it was expected to be a close game, and at half-time Auckland were just leading by a conversion, 5–3. In the second half, Auckland's forwards imposed themselves on Wellington, who struggled to maintain the pace and were unable to respond to Auckland's scoring.\nDewar moved to Taranaki in 1910, where he played his club rugby for Stratford; he captained the team in 1913. He was first selected for Taranaki that year and continued to represent the club until the outbreak of the First World War. In 1912, Taranaki, with Dewar in the team, came close to winning the Ranfurly Shield from Auckland, losing 6–5. In front of a 12,000-spectator home crowd, Auckland dominated in the first half, scoring six points through a try and a penalty kick. The second half saw Taranaki's forwards take control for long periods, resulting in a converted try, but despite ongoing attacks, the visitors were unable to add to their score and lost by just one point.\n1913 Season.\n1913 saw Dewar's best season. His provincial form saw him selected for the North Island in the annual Inter-Island match, having been nominated for inclusion the previous year but not selected. In the event, the North was beaten 25–0. He was then part of the Taranaki team that ended Auckland's long tenure of the Ranfurly Shield, in a game described as \"the finest match... and the most exciting... ever witnessed in the history of the Ranfurly Shield\". Taranaki controlled the first half, with the forwards stronger than their opponents in every aspect, scoring the first points. The visitors' lead of 0–3, however, changed to a half-time score of 5–3 in Auckland's favour after an injury temporarily reduced the opposition to fourteen men. Soon after the break, Taranaki took the lead through a try, and then a second — scored by Dewar, who was continuously \"in the thick of it\" — took them four points ahead, 5–9. The home side responded with two tries of their own to take back a two-point lead. Towards the end of the game, Taranaki scored one more try, which was converted and gave them a 14–11 victory to win the Shield for the first time: Auckland was the first team to be awarded the Shield in 1902 and, after Wellington won it in 1904, regained it and held on to it continuously from 1906.\nHe also played in the Taranaki side that was only narrowly beaten by the touring Australians in 1913. His form in these games earned him a place with the All Blacks. On 6September 1913, he played in the 30–5 first test win over Australia at Athletic Park: Albert Downing and George Sellars played alongside him and were also later killed in action in the First World War. Dewar was then selected, along with four other Taranaki players, for the tour of North America, playing in 14 of the 16 games, including the 51–3 victory over the All America team for his second test cap. He received particular mention in the test match for a cunning dummy pass to Downing on his right, drawing the defence and passing to five-eighths McKenzie on his left to run in for a try. He scored just one try. There was little interest in the American press about the tour. A single short paragraph in the \"New-York Tribune\" reports on the 51–3 defeat of the USA team on 15November.\nIn 1914, Dewar participated in Taranaki's defence of the Shield against Wellington on 24June, winning 14–10; Wanganui, on 27June, winning 17–3; Manawatu, on 23July, winning 11–3, with Dewar \"prominent\"; Horowhenua; and Wairarapa, on 14August, winning 22–3. Within days of this last game, a number of Taranaki's players, including Dewar, left to join the New Zealand Expeditionary Force: \"a brilliant forward... who would almost certainly have gone to Australia this season [on the All Blacks tour] if he had been available for selection\". Although defeating Canterbury on 20August, Taranaki's pack was particularly weakened by Dewar's absence, and only managed to win 6–5 with a last minute try. Against a second challenge from Wellington on 10September, the conspicuous absence of this \"fine leader of forwards\" contributed to the loss of the Shield.\nHis obituary in \"The Sun\" described him as \"one of the best forwards in the New Zealand team which visited California... he was fast and very clever, and always gave of his best. He was a good all-round athlete — an excellent boxer and no mean cricketer.\"\nMilitary career.\nDewar enlisted early, joining the New Zealand Expeditionary Force leaving on 15August 1914 for German Samoa. On his return he volunteered again, joining the 9th Wellington Mounted Rifles as a machine gunner and was based at Awapuni Racecourse, Palmerston North; he was promoted quickly to sergeant. On 16October 1914, after training, Dewar embarked on the \"Orari\" at Wellington en route for Egypt. There, Dewar captained the Wellington Mounted Rifles rugby team in several matches against other regiments — beating the First Australian Light Horse, the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, and the Auckland Mounted Rifles — before his regiment landed on 8August 1915 at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli. Twenty-four hours later, on 9August 1915, Dewar lost his life in the assault on Chunuk Bair — Albert Downing was killed in the same action, the first All Black to be killed in the war. Sergeant Henry Dewar is commemorated on the Chunuk Bair (NZ) Memorial Turkey (Panel 4).\nHis mother, sister and brother published these words \"in memoriam\":\nOur thoughts they ever wander to a soldier's honoured grave,\nNever will we forget the noble sacrifice you made;\nFor our hearts arc still united in that same fond love for you,\nAnd loving thoughts are cherished of one so brave and true.\nYour cheery, sunny countenance will not from memory fade,\nFor we see you in the photo, in the home you died to save;\nAnd when our hearts are sore for you we seem to hear you say,\nBreak not your heart, dear mother, we will meet on that Eternal Day.\nSo widely known; so highly esteemed."

In 1991, the DCB became an Affiliate member of the International Cricket Council. In 1999 it graduated to the level of an Associate, after recommendation by Namibia and Pakistan. It is also a member of the ICC Europe (earlier the European Cricket Council). By May 2021, almost 150 clubs were playing cricket in Germany.\nHistory.\nGermany's first separate cricket body, the Deutscher Cricket Bund (DCB), representing teams from Berlin, Nuremberg, Furth, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Mannheim and Hamburg was formed in 1912. The original federation did not last and it was 76 years later that the modern DCB was formed.\nToday, there are over 100 cricket clubs across Germany, with nearly 3000 players registered in total. The DCB has a budget of about €220,000 ($241,000) per year, most of which comes from the ICC. With an influx of new cricketers migrating to Germany from Asia, especially Afghan refugees, and an increase in junior players learning the game inside in Germany, the number of cricketers registered with the DCB is expected to continue to rise."

It was the fifth time the event had been contested at the Summer Universiade and was its first appearance since the 2011 Summer Universiade, archery having not been selected as part of the sporting programme for the 2013 edition. Open to athletes aged between 17 and 28 enrolled in an undergraduate or postgraduate university programme, a total of fifty-eight archers from twenty-nine countries entered the competition.\nKi Bo-bae of South Korea entered as the defending champion. Ki also entered as the reigning Olympic champion, with Mariana Avitia of Mexico, who won the bronze medal at the London 2012 Olympics, also competing.\nIn the ranking round Ki broke the world record score for a 72-arrow round which had been held by former Olympic champion Park Sung-hyun, also of South Korea, for more than ten years. Ki went on to successfully defend her Universiade title, defeating teammate Choi Mi-sun in a one-arrow shoot-off in the final to win the gold medal. Maja Jager of Denmark won the bronze medal after beating Hsiung Mei-chien of Chinese Taipei, also in a one-arrow shoot-off.\nFormat.\nThe women's individual was an outdoor recurve target archery event held to the World Archery-approved rules. Archers shot at a 122 cm-wide target from a distance of 70 metres, with each arrow awarded between one and ten points depending on how close it landed to the centre of the target. The competition was spread over five days and consisted of an initial ranking round, six elimination rounds, and two finals matches, which decided the winners of the gold, silver, and bronze medals. In the ranking round, each of the 58 archers entering the competition shot a total of 72 arrows. The total score of each archer was used to seed the archers into the following single-elimination tournament, the number one seed going to the highest-scoring archer.\nThe elimination rounds used the Archery Olympic Round set system introduced in international competitions in 2010. Each match consisted of a maximum of five sets, with archers each shooting three arrows per set. The archer with the highest score from their three arrows, for a maximum of 30, won the set, earning two set points. The archer with the lowest score in each set received zero points. If the score was tied, each archer received one point. The first archer to reach six set points was declared the winner. If the match was tied at five set points each after the maximum five sets were played, a single tie-breaker arrow was used with the archer shooting closest to centre of the target winning.\nReport.\nThe ranking round held on the morning of Saturday, 4 July was dominated by the three South Korean entries of Ki, Choi, and Kang Chae-young. Ki topped the standings with a new world record total for a 72-arrow round, scoring 686 to beat the existing record of Park Sung-hyun, set in 2004, by four points. It was not initially clear whether Ki's score would be officially recognised due to conflicting information about whether the Summer Universiade competition met World Archery standards for a new record to be set. The Gwangju Universiade Organising Committee later confirmed on the following Wednesday that Ki would indeed stand as the new world record holder.\nThe final between Ki and Choi was characterised by \"Chungnam Ilbo\" as a battle between the present and future stars of Korean archery. It was the second time the two had faced off against one another in an international final in 2015, having previously contested the gold medal at the second stage of the Archery World Cup in Antalya, Turkey, in which Choi emerged victorious. In an even contest, neither Ki nor Choi shot lower than 28 in any of the five sets, Ki holding the advantage until Choi won the third and fourth sets to take a 5–3 lead in set points. A perfect score of 30 in the fifth set by Ki however tied the match, necessitating the day's second medal-deciding one-arrow shoot-off.\nThe victory marked Ki's first individual title for almost three years.\nResults.\nRanking round.\n Advanced to 1/16 elimination round &lt;br&gt;\n Advanced to 1/24 elimination round &lt;br&gt;\n Advanced to 1/48 elimination round\nFinals.\n &lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "Safety of cycling infrastructure",
        "text": "There is debate over the safety implications of cycling infrastructure (e.g. cycle tracks, protected intersections). Recent studies generally affirm that segregated cycle tracks have a better safety record between intersections than cycling on major roads in traffic. Furthermore, cycling infrastructure tends to lead to more people cycling. A higher modal share of people cycling is correlated with lower incidences of cyclist fatalities, leading to a \"safety in numbers\" effect though some contributors caution against this hypothesis. On the contrary, older studies tended to come to negative conclusions about mid-block cycle track safety.\nHowever, the implications for road safety of cycle tracks at intersections is disputed. Studies generally show an increase in collisions at junctions, especially where cyclists are travelling in the direction opposite to the flow of traffic (e.g. on two-way cycle tracks). Protected intersection designs generally improve safety records over non-protected junction types.\nA 2006 report by the National Cooperative Highway Research Program in the US concludes that \"bicycle safety data are difficult to analyze, mostly because bicycle trip data (and thus accident probability per trip) are hard to uncover\". One major reason for the inability to draw definite conclusion may be that facilities with different risks are often categorized together so that off-road paths – paved or unpaved, bicycle-only or multi-use – were lumped together, as found by research at the Cycling in Cities program at the University of British Columbia.\nSafety in numbers effect.\nA study by P. L. Jacobsen found that as cycling and walking levels increase, the chance that a given cyclist will be struck by a motor vehicle actually decreases. This pattern is consistent across communities of varying size, from specific intersections to cities and countries, and across time periods. Jacobsen found that doubling the number of cyclists on the road tends to bring about a one-third drop in the per-cyclist frequency of a crash with a motor vehicle. By the same token, tripling the rate of cycling cuts the crash rate in half. A study of the accident impacts of re-engineering bicycle crossings in the Swedish city of Gothenburg appears to corroborate those findings by attributing collision rate reductions in part to significant increases in cyclist volumes at the treated sites. Studies have demonstrated that cities with high levels of cycling tend to have better traffic safety records for all road users. However, the same study also suggests that the 'safety in numbers' effect is not as important in improving safety records as building cycling infrastructure. Improving bike infrastructure with more separated facilities leads to lower fatalities and more safety for all road users.\nFurthermore, countries which have higher levels of cycling have lower fatality rates for cyclists than countries which do not. The table below shows the modal split share for cycling compared with the cycling fatality rate in the Netherlands, Germany and the United States.\nA unpublished paper from the Helsinki City Planning Department reported that the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark, known for cycle networks and one-way cycle tracks, had the lowest rates of cyclist fatalities, while countries without such extensive networks such as Great Britain and Italy reported higher rates.\nThere is evidence that one of the main factors influencing the individual safety of cyclists is the number of cyclists using the roads, commonly called the safety in numbers effect. Cycling facilities increase the perception of safety, leaving aside the evidence supporting or detracting from their actual risk. Cycling increases on routes with cycling facilities, particularly if they are separated cycle tracks. With greater numbers of cyclists in relation to motorists, the safety in number effect is seen.\nDetractors argue that the most prominent examples of \"successful\" cycle networks were implemented in towns that already had significant numbers of cyclists. In the Netherlands, for example, drivers know to expect a high volume of cyclist traffic and bicycle paths are widespread and (in the cities) closed to scooters. Due to this expectation, some argue, the number of car-bike collisions with serious consequences is not alarmingly high in the Netherlands. In such cases, it is speculated that an existing large cycling population might already exert a \"safety in numbers\" effect, and it is this, rather than their diversion onto off-road tracks, that accounts for the better safety record. More people might start cycling if the perceived safety of doing so improved sufficiently.\nBhatia and Wier caution against the \"Safety in Numbers\" hypothesis, because it is unsubstantiated. The claim that larger numbers changes motorist behaviour is judged as premature and the authors urge better research into the topic. A 2019 study of the relation between bicycling rates and road safety users conclude that 'more bicyclists on the road is not as important as the infrastructure we build for them'.\nIn general.\nAultman-Hall \"et al.\" produced a 1998 study based on a survey of Ottawa commuter cyclists and a survey of Toronto commuter cyclists. The surveys were conducted to create \"estimates of travel exposure on roads, off-road paths and sidewalks\". They found that \"the relative rates for falls and injuries suggest it is safest to cycle on-road followed by off-road paths and trails, and finally least safe on sidewalks.\" The relative rates of collisions on the three different facility types, however, were not statistically significant in the Ottawa study. Aultman-Hall \"et al.\" admitted that the limitations to the data and a fuller analysis needed \"bicycle travel exposure information and the use of more than just collision databases\".\nStudies that also found negative safety aspects of cycle tracks also come from Linderholm, Sweden, 1984 and from Jensen \"et al.\", Denmark 1997.\nOpponents say that segregation of cyclists from fast or frequent motorized traffic increases crash and injury rates. For example, the author of a 2014 review of cycling safety concluded that the majority of studies showed increased crash and injury rates on segregated cycle facilities. He criticized the methodology of studies showing the opposite, including the Montreal study.\nA study on cycling safety in the Netherlands reviewed how the Dutch achieved an 80% reduction in the number of cyclists killed per distance cycled over a 30-year period. Some factors in this reduction were the establishment of a road hierarchy (the Dutch 'unbundling' approach) with separate routes for fast-moving motor traffic and slower-moving cycle traffic and an extensive network of separated bicycle paths and intersection treatments. The study highlighted not just the importance of infrastructure which takes cyclists off busy roads, but also takes motorists off less-suitable roads. The Netherlands' extensive motorway network shifts large amounts of traffic from city roads to spaces away from more vulnerable road users.\nA 2019 study of the relation between bicycling rates and road safety users found that cities with more protected cycle facilities correlates with better road safety records.\nA study in Amsterdam found that cycle lanes incur nearly double the risk of cyclist crashes compared to cycle tracks. The absence of cycling facilities was not significant until streets with similar conditions are compared. For three given streets with similar conditions - one with cycle tracks, one with cycle lanes and one with no facilities - the risk of a crash is higher on a street with no facilities or cycle lanes rather than cycle tracks. Overall, the study reports a safety benefit of 50-60% fewer cycling crashes of cycle tracks over mixed traffic. Kerbside parking leads to increased crashes due to dooring and visibility obstructions.\nA 2021 study confirmed an expectation that the presence of protected bike lanes is associated with significant improvement in biking safety. The model predicts that by adding bike lanes to non-local streets increases biking safety by 26% in a local area.\nBetween intersections.\nIn the 1970s, the California Statewide Bicycle Committee commissioned Kenneth D. Cross to study car-bike collisions. The Committee had supposed that many collisions would occur when cars overtook bicycles and that such a finding would help to justify their plans to offer segregation between junctions. Unexpectedly, Cross found that only 0.5% of car-bike collisions had occurred between straight-ahead cyclists and overtaking straight-ahead motorists. Cross in 1977 had a contract with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to produce an improved study (on a pseudo-random national sample), and the results were much the same. In second study by Cross, he argues that, \"although a reduction in overtaking accidents may not be sufficient justification for the widespread use of on-street bicycle lanes, it is possible that their cost could be justified when considering all the problem types that might be positively affected by such facilities. There is virtually no doubt that off-street bicycle lanes would reduce the incidence of overtaking accidents, if such facilities were available and used by bicyclists who would otherwise be riding on roadways.\"\nA 1988 British medical study suggested that their data indicated that cycle lanes were safer than ordinary roads, reducing the kilometre rate of collisions.\nA 1997 study by Moritz of North American bicycle commuters calculated a relative danger of different facilities based on the survey results of \"[fraction of crashes] divided by the [fraction of miles ridden on that facility]\". Moritz calculated a relative danger of 1.26 on a major street with no cycling facilities, 1.04 on a minor street with no cycling facilities, 0.5 for streets with bike lanes, and 0.67 for mixed use/\"bike\" path. The \"other\" category, which mostly included sidewalks, had a relative danger of 5.32. Moritz made it clear that this was \"[n]ot a statistical or random sample of BCs [bicycle commuters].\"\nIn Germany, the Berlin police conducted a 1987 study which came to a negative conclusion about cycle tracks. The German Cycling Federation at the 1990 Vélo Secur conference on cycling stated \"Because the separation of different types of traffic by means of sidepaths behind curbs makes excessive demands on users and leads to crashes, other solutions are being increasingly recommended for channeling bicycle traffic.\" The cycle tracks in Berlin, however, were not removed and Berlin continues to have an extensive network of bicycle facilities on- and off-road, including cycle tracks.\nA 1999 study in Helsinki found that two-way cycle tracks accounted for a disproportionate number of cycling injury collisions. However, the study did not account for injury severity, and as a result may have underestimated the benefit of two-way cycle tracks in reducing severe injuries associated with overtaking (i.e. the most common cause of fatal cyclist collisions).\nBritish cycling safety educator John Franklin has argued that the vast majority of research implies increases in the rate and severity of car-bicycle collisions due to such segregation, based on an overview of studies published up to 1999. For example, his study into Milton Keynes' \"redways\" in the late 90s discovered that the city's grid roads (60 and 70 mph rural-style arterial roads) are the safest in terms of accidents to cyclists per distance cycled. Cyclists were found to be more likely to be killed when using a redway than a grid road. He attributes this to poor user discipline on the redways, under a false illusion of safety, which also spills into other areas, such as increased footway cycling. Redways are shared use with pedestrians and not true cycle tracks. Neither user finds this to be a satisfactory arrangement, that the redways are sites of increased fear among users.\nTransportation engineers Ian Hallett, David Luskin, and Randy Machemehl, by studying the interactions of drivers and bicyclists on Texas roads, have discovered that having painted bike lanes on streets and roads helps both commuters stay in safer, more central positions in their respective lanes. Without a marked bike lane, there appears to be a lot of uncertainty about how much space each person needs—even when adequate road space is provided.\nA 2007 unpublished study in Copenhagen found that one-way cycle tracks reduced rear-end collisions, while increasing crashes with right-turning vehicles and crashes with other cyclists and pedestrians. There was also an increase in collisions with bus passengers where they exit directly onto the cycle track. The study had accuracy problems in its prediction model.\nIn the United Kingdom, the UK Cycle Campaign Network made a 2007 statement that they know \"of no evidence that cycle facilities and in particular cycle lanes, generally lead to safer conditions for cycling\".\nIn 2009, the University of British Columbia \"Cycling in Cities\" Research Program looked at injury and crash data separated by bicycle facility type and found that \"purpose-built bicycle-only facilities have the lowest risk of crashes and injuries\". They found such bike-only facilities had lower risk than cycling on-road with motor traffic as well as off-road with pedestrians on sidewalks or multi-use paths. The highest risk of crashes and injuries were found to be on sidewalks and unpaved off-road trails.\nA large study undertaken by S.U. Jensen \"et al\". into the safety of Copenhagen cycle tracks before and after they were constructed concludes \"The construction of cycle tracks in Copenhagen has resulted in an increase in cycle traffic of 18–20% and a decline in car traffic of 9–10%. The cycle tracks constructed have resulted in increases in accidents and injuries of 9–10% on the reconstructed roads.\" The number of accidents and injuries increased at intersections but decreased mid-block. These changes in road safety have been estimated taking both general trends in safety and changes in car and cycle traffic into account. The Copenhagen study also found accident and injury rates were related to the amount of car parking and number of turn lanes, blue cycle crossing markings, and raised exits at non-signalised intersections, suggesting that risk is dependent on making various improvements to the cycle tracks. For instance, recent planning guidelines in the US advise that cycle tracks drop to a bike lane before arriving at an intersection to increase the visibility of cyclists. The British Cycling Embassy criticises this study because the before-and-after design makes it impossible to isolate the effects of the cycle track design from changes in the types of cyclists (less confident/experienced cyclists) using the street. Furthermore, the study is based on a predictive model. The study alters the 'before' figures to account for the changes in traffic composition before and after the track installation.\nA number of studies found that on-road marked bike lanes have a positive safety effect. They reduce road safety events by about 50% compared to unmarked roadways.\nAccording to one literature review, clearly-marked, bike-specific facilities are consistently shown by studies on the topic to improve safety for cyclists compared to riding with traffic or off-road with pedestrians.\nA 2010 study in Montreal, Canada authors found 2.5 times as many cyclists rode on the cycle tracks (physically separated bicycle-exclusive paths along roads) compared to the reference roads (a parallel road with approximately the same intersection frequency and cross traffic) and that the relative risk of injury was \"lower\" on a cycle track than on the comparable reference road (the average being 0.72 the relative risk). They concluded that \"[c]ycle tracks lessen, or at least do not increase, crash and injury rates compared to bicycling in the street\"\nA 2010 study of Texan cities found that cycle lanes are a safer environment than wide outside lanes and that parked car buffers are the only reliable method to prevent dooring.\nIn 2012, a study in Canada found that cycling on segregated tracks had approximately one ninth the risk of cycling on major streets with parked cars and no cycle infrastructure, concluding that, \"Transportation infrastructure with lower bicycling injury risks merits public health support to reduce injuries and promote cycling.\"\nA 2017 study into the Netherlands called the overall safety effect of one-way cycle tracks \"positive\" but noted the worse safety record of two-way tracks compared with one-way tracks.\nA 2019 US-based medical study found that 'the implementation of urban bike lanes improved bicyclist safety'.\nA 2020 study in Toronto, Canada, found that cycle track implementation is linked with reduced cycle-motorist collisions after adjusting for increased volume. There is also a 35% reduction in these collisions for up to 550 m from the cycle track, which is attributed to more cyclists moving from surrounding streets to the cycle track.\nCrashes from motorists overtaking cyclist on arterial roads.\nOne benefit of cycle tracks is the reduction of motorist-overtaking collisions. There are more rear impacts with cyclists on arterial/rural-type roads. When they occur in such circumstances, they are also associated with significantly increased risk of fatality. Rear-end type collisions by overtaking motorists who didn't see the cyclist (Type 13 in the Cross-Fisher study) have been characterized as negligibly few in one analysis by John Forester and another analysis by Kenneth Cross characterized them as being the most deadly of crashes – three times the fatalities of other crash types (both used the same data). All motorist overtaking crashes were combined by Cross into a category called \"Problem Class D–Motorist Overtaking/Overtaking Threat\" accounting for 37.8% of fatal crashes and 10.5% of non-fatal crashes in their study. One possible explanation for the low overall number of collisions is that motorists coming from behind have plenty of time to see and avoid the collision, but another \"possible explanation for the low number of overtaking collisions is that, as noted earlier, bicyclists fear and avoid roads where the overtaking threat seems greatest\". Though such crashes were not in the majority they both had a perception of being quite dangerous by the majority of cyclists as well as having a high percentage of the fatal crashes.\nIn the UK, cycling collision data recorded by police indicates that at non-junction locations, where a cyclist was struck directly from behind there was an overall fatality rate of 17%. The rate of fatality increases with speed limit of the road:\nThe use of appropriately designed segregated space on arterial or interurban routes appears to be associated with reductions in overall risk. In Ireland, the provision of hard shoulders on interurban routes in the 1970s reportedly resulted in a 50% decrease in accidents. It is reported that the Danes have also found that separate cycle tracks lead to a reduction in rural collisions.\nAt junctions.\n In 1988, a Dutch study found that cycle tracks in built up areas are safer for cyclists and moped riders between junctions, but have an increased collision rate at junctions. Therefore, the study recommends cycle tracks are ended before the junction.\nA 1994 study in Palo Alto, California by A. Wachtel and D. Lewiston concluded that \"Bicyclists on a sidewalk or bicycle path incur greater risk than those on the roadway (on average 1.8 times as great), most likely because of blind conflicts at intersections. Wrong-way sidewalk bicyclists are at even greater risk, and sidewalk bicycling appears to increase the incidence of wrong-way travel.\" and \"Separation of bicycles and motor vehicles leads to blind conflicts at these intersections.\" It concluded \"the aim of a well-designed roadway system should be to integrate bicycles and motor vehicles according to the well-established and effective principles of traffic law and engineering, not to separate them. This conclusion is in accord with the 1981 and 1991 AASHTO Guides and the California Highway Design Manual\". Anne C. Lusk \"et al.\" noted that the study by Wachtel and Lewiston only considered intersection crashes, \"omitting non-intersection crashes that include being hit from behind, sideswiped, or struck by a car door.\" If the non-intersection crash data is included, as Lusk \"et al.\" calculated in their study, it appears that sidewalk bikeways carry half the risk of the street, for bicyclists riding in the same direction as traffic. Lusk \"et al.\" claim that the \"Wachtel and Lewiston data, when corrected to include non-intersection crashes, corroborate our findings that separated paths are safer or at least no more dangerous than bicycling in the street.\"\nA Danish study by Agerholm \"et al.\" in 2008 concluded that \"Through the years many studies have shown that bicycle paths in built-up areas impair traffic safety. A new Danish study presented in this article confirms these results... the main results are that bicycle paths impair traffic safety and this is mainly due to more accidents at intersections, and that there has been no improvement in the design of new bicycle paths compared to the older ones.\"\nA 2020 study in Toronto, Canada found that the majority of cyclist-motorist collisions on roads with cycle tracks occur at intersections, though the increase of intersection's proportion of total collisions is minimal. The frequency of collisions at signalised intersections increased from 8% to 22%.\nSide road crossings.\nAt non-signalised junctions, cyclists face risks from turning motor traffic. This is dependent on the degree of setback of the cycle track from the carriageway edge and whether the cycle track is one- or two-way. Research presented by the ADFC (German Cycling Federation) at a conference at Lund University in 1990 found that \"crash risk\" for cycle users crossing the intersection on a set-back path are up to 11.9 times higher than when cycling on the roadway in a bike lane (see diagrams). Since 1990, the ADFC now advocates for the introduction of both cycle tracks and cycle lanes. The organisation only supports cycle lanes on roads up to 50 km/h. The ADFC calls protected cycle lanes \"a very safe, high quality and well-suited form of routing for cycle traffic\".\nA 2017 Dutch study found that the likelihood of crashes at unsignalised intersections with one-way cycle paths is 45% lower when the track is deflected between 2 and 5 metres from the kerb. Compared with one-way cycle tracks, two-way tracks have a 75% elevated risk of collisions at unsignalised junctions because drivers coming from minor roads do not expect cyclists to come from both directions. The same study found that protected intersections in the Netherlands, with speed reduction measures and a clearance of 2 to 5 metres between the cycle track and the carriageway improve cycling safety, particularly because it keeps cyclists out of the sightlines of right-turning trucks.\nSolutions to the junction safety problem.\nRemedial measures have been developed in an attempt to reduce the risk of junctions for cycle tracks. In some environments these represent established engineering practice while in others they may have to be retroactively applied in response to complaints and safety concerns. Examples include the addition of a separate system of traffic signals for bicycle traffic; markings – either coloured or sharrows continued through the intersection; bike boxes with no right turn on red lights for motorists, raised intersections, and elimination of car parking or the barrier as the cycle track approaches the intersection.\nSome treatments involve raising the cycle track onto a speed ramp-type structure where it crosses side roads (\"raised side road crossings\"). In addition, various road markings have been developed in an attempt to remedy the issue of increased junction collisions. Examples of these include the use of special road markings, e.g. \"sharks teeth\" or \"elephants footprints\", and treatments using red, green or blue coloured tarmac. Other approaches include efforts to \"traffic calm\" the bicycle traffic by introducing tight curves or bends to slow the cyclists down as they near a junction. Alternatively, traffic engineers may remove priority from the cyclists and require them to yield to turning traffic at every side road. In 2002, engineers proposing a sidepath scheme in the Irish university city of Galway stated that cyclists would be required to dismount and \"become pedestrians\" at every junction on the finished route.\nA common Dutch model for improving the safety of cycle tracks at junctions involves separating cars turning right by a car length from crossing cyclists and pedestrians, providing increased reaction times and visibility. Alta Planning &amp; Design popularized this as the \"protected intersection\" model.\nIntersection designs which route cyclists around an intersection separately from motorists leads to a safer road environment than bike lanes or in-traffic cycling. The most common road danger associated with them is the \"looked but failed to see\" event, whereby a motorist does not see a cyclist because they are not specifically looking for them.\nA 2016 study of intersections with bicycle tracks found that cycle tracks on the right (nearside) through a junction were safer than having no cycle tracks at a junction. This is associated with 25% fewer interactions than no cycle tracks. Cycle tracks on the left were found to have no real effect on safety compared with no cycle tracks. Interaction severity reduces as more cyclists use the junction. More turning vehicles and more approach lanes results in more risk to cyclists.\nRoundabouts.\nStudies show that multi-lane roundabouts significantly increase risk to cyclists unless a separated cycle track is provided. Furthermore the installation of marked bike lanes on a roundabout leads to higher risks for cyclists. The installation of separated cycle tracks around roundabouts leads to no change or risk reductions for cyclists.\nIn the United Kingdom and Germany there is some concern to the use of cycle lanes in large urban roundabouts, though it is still common to see such facilities in the Netherlands and elsewhere. In 2002, cycle lanes were removed from a roundabout in the English town of Weymouth after 20 months because the casualty rate had increased significantly, according to the local cycling campaign. German research has indicated that cyclists are safer negotiating roundabouts in traffic rather than on separate cycle lanes or cycle paths. A recent paper on German roundabout design practice states \"Cycle lanes at the peripheral margin of the circle are not allowed since they are very dangerous to cyclists\".\nIn the Netherlands, researchers focused on separating bicycle tracks from motorised traffic. They found that \"roundabouts with separate bicycle tracks have a much lower number of casualties per roundabout than roundabouts with bicycle lanes, van Minnen (1995)\". This meant that Dutch planners focused more on designing roundabouts and cycle tracks with appropriate priority rather than mix cyclists with other traffic or put them on cycle lanes at the edge. A 2009 study on Dutch roundabouts found that roundabouts with separated cycle tracks had a greater safety effect than those with on-road marked bike lanes or no dedicated infrastructure.\nFor adults, the standard advice in the vehicular cycling philosophy for handling roundabouts is to try to maintain a prominent position while circulating. The use of cycle lanes runs counter to this vehicular cycling approach and places cyclists outside the main \"zone of observation\" of entering motorists, who represent the major source risk.\nChanges for all road users.\nThe New York City Department of Transportation implemented a bicycle path and traffic calming pilot project for Prospect Park West in Brooklyn in 2010 and published their results in early 2011. It created a two-way bicycle path with a parking lane buffer and the removal of one lane from motor vehicles. They found that weekday cycling traffic tripled after the implementation; cyclists riding on the sidewalk fell to 3% from 46% (the count included children who are legally allowed to ride on the sidewalk); speeding dropped from 74% to 20% of all vehicles; crashes for all road users were down 16% and injuries to all road users were down 21%.\nPedestrians.\nThe provision of bikeways may result in additional risk to pedestrians. This is particularly likely to be the case where cycle lanes are not readily distinguishable from pedestrian areas, e.g. due to the choice of surfacing or lane markers, or if the layout is confusing, or if the pedestrians area is inadequate for the numbers of people using the space. Pedestrians may easily stray into the cycle lanes without realising they have done so.\nPotential hazards arise where the cycle lane is bidirectional on the \"wrong\" side of the road, in which case the pedestrian crossing the cycle lane may look in the wrong direction, and at crossings where traffic lights apply to vehicles on the carriageway but not to the cycle lane.\nAlthough cyclists pose a risk to pedestrians, the risk for pedestrians is minor. In the United Kingdom, from 2012 to 2016, 2,120 pedestrians were killed by a vehicle; 0.8% of these involved a bicycle and 66% involved a car.\nOther infrastructure.\nStreet lighting.\nFurthermore, the presence of street lighting on rural roads reduced the rate of cyclists' injuries by half.\nPerceptions of safety.\nA high perception of safety is important in determining modal choice, particularly for parents.\nA 1999 study by John Franklin in Milton Keynes found that cyclists perceived redways (shared use paths which criss-cross the city) to be less safe than grid or local roads (only 37% viewed grid roads as safe), but less secure, less well maintained, less well lit and more difficult to find your way.\nA 2015 study involved a survey of cyclists in a street in Toronto, Canada. Results reported 38% would use other travel modes than cycling before the construction of cycle tracks (to replace painted bike lanes). An improvement to safety was the most commonly cited reason for this modal shift.\nHealth benefits.\nIn addition, it has been shown that in western countries the health benefits of regular cycling significantly outweigh the risks due to traffic danger. Therefore, notwithstanding their effect on crashes and injuries, measures that promote cycling should produce an overall societal health benefit.\nDutch analysts have argued as a statistical exercise that given that three times as many cyclists as car occupants are injured in collisions, and that cars harm about three times the number of other road users that bicycles do, in situations where casualties due to car traffic predominate, increasing the number of cycling journeys and reducing the number of car journeys will reduce the total number of casualties\nWith the number of cyclists growing due to the bike lanes, it would create less pollution in the air, reducing health problems such as asthma, especially for those most at risk such as children."

The players entering were formally submitted by the International Tennis Federation. The ATP and WTA rankings were based on performances from the previous 52 weeks, and there were several tournaments in the two-month period between the time of the rankings being frozen for entry and the beginning of the tennis events at the Olympics. Players had to be part of a nominated team for three Fed Cup (women) or Davis Cup (men) events between the 2012 and 2016 Olympics.

        "text": "The FIFA Women's World Cup is the international association football championship for women's national teams who represent members of FIFA, the sport's global governing body. It has been contested every four years since 1991 between teams who qualify through continental competitions, alongside the hosts who have an automatic berth. The tournament is one of the most-watched women's sporting events in the world, with a global television audience of over 82.18 million viewers for the 2019 final.\nLike modern editions of the men's tournament, the FIFA Women's World Cup final is the last match of the competition's knockout stage. The single match is played by the two remaining teams who advanced from the semifinal round and determines the world champions in women's association football. In the event of a draw after 90 minutes of regulation time, an additional 30 minutes of extra time is used to determine a winner. If scores are still tied, a penalty shootout is played until one team wins. Some editions of the tournament allowed for a golden goal in extra time to determine a winner, which was used in the 2003 final.\nThe inaugural edition was hosted by China in 1991 and featured 12 teams playing 80-minute matches. It was preceded by several unofficial world championships, but the 1991 tournament was the first to be organized directly by FIFA. It was known as the 1st FIFA World Championship for Women's Football for the M&amp;Ms Cup and retroactively given the World Cup moniker. The World Cup expanded to 16 teams in the 1999 edition, which was hosted by the United States and drew record attendances. The 2003 edition was planned to be hosted by China, but moved to the United States due to a major SARS outbreak. An expansion to 24 teams in the 2015 edition was followed by the adoption of the current 32-team format for the 2023 edition, the first with multiple host countries.\nA total of ten teams have played in the nine finals held since 1991; five have won a title. The United States is the most successful team in Women's World Cup history, having won four titles in five finals. Germany has two titles and finished as runners-up once; Japan and Norway each have one title and have both finished as runners-up in another final. The most recent tournament, hosted by Australia and New Zealand in 2023, was won by Spain; they defeated fellow first-time finalists England in the final, played at Stadium Australia in Sydney. The team that wins the final is presented with the FIFA Women's World Cup Trophy, which is kept by FIFA and displayed occasionally on tours or at the FIFA Museum in Zürich, Switzerland. A replica, called the FIFA Women's World Cup Winner's Trophy, is awarded to the winning team and engraved with their name.\nResults by confederation.\nThe national associations that compete in FIFA events are also members of six regional confederations that represent different regions of the world, generally organized by continent. Teams from three confederations have won the tournament: UEFA, which represents Europe; CONCACAF, which represents North America, Central America, and the Caribbean; and AFC, which represents Asia. The South American confederation, CONMEBOL, has also had a team finish as runners-up. The remaining two confederations have not had a finalist: CAF (Africa) and OFC (Oceania)."

        "title": "Samoa women's national cricket team",
        "text": "The Samoan women's national cricket team, nicknamed the Nafanua, represents the country of Samoa in international women's cricket. It is organised by the game's governing body in the country, the Samoa International Cricket Association (SICA).\nAlthough women's cricket has a long history in Samoa, the national team was only formally organised in 2010, with assistance from a New Zealand association, Auckland Cricket. The team has often included Samoan expatriate players based in Australia and New Zealand (including some who have played for state or provincial teams), which has presented difficulties in training. Samoa's first regional tournament came later in 2010, and it has since regularly participated in ICC East Asia-Pacific events, generally ranking behind only Japan and Papua New Guinea in the region. The women's team's most notable achievement has been winning the gold medal in the women's tournament at the 2015 Pacific Games. The team is currently coached by Ian West, an Englishman who gained Samoan citizenship through his wife, and subsequently played for the Samoan men's team.\nIn April 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) granted full Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Samoa women and another international side since 1 July 2018 have the full WT20I status.\nHistory.\nCricket has been played in Samoa since the 19th century, when it was introduced by British traders and missionaries. It flourished despite a ban during the period of the German protectorate, from 1900 to 1914. Historically, the sport has been most popular when played under the modified rules known as \"kilikiti\". However, since the early 2000s, when Samoa gained affiliate membership of the International Cricket Council (ICC) and its men's national team debuted internationally (in 2000 and 2001, respectively), the standard form of cricket has begun to replace \"kilikiti\" in popularity.\nThe Samoan women's team played its first international matches in February 2010, when Fiji toured to play a three-match series at Apia's Faleata Oval (in the Tuanaimato area). Fiji were also playing their first internationals. A major impetus for the establishment of a woman's team was its status as a requirement for associate membership of the ICC, to which SICA aspires. Samoa, captained by Perelini Mulitalo, went on to win the series 3–0, and consequently qualified as the third team (after Japan and Papua New Guinea) for the 2010 EAP Trophy in Japan, the team's first major tournament.\nSamoa went on to lose all three of its matches at the EAP Trophy, a 50-over tournament, with their closest game being a 12-run loss to Japan in the qualifying final. Their captain there was Mindy Hodgson, a former representative of the Wellington Blaze in New Zealand domestic cricket. However, the Samoans were more successful at their next regional tournament, the 2012 EAP Women's Championship in Port Vila, Vanuatu. That tournament was played using the Twenty20 format, with the winner progressing to the 2013 World Twenty20 Qualifier in Ireland). The three teams from the 2010 tournament were joined by the Cook Islands, Fiji, and Vanuatu. Samoa won all of its group-stage matches (played only against the three newcomers), but lost in the semi-final against Papua New Guinea, eventually placing third after defeating Vanuatu in the third-place playoff.\nAt the 2014 EAP Women's Championship in Japan (a qualifier for the 2015 World Twenty20 Qualifier), Samoa again placed third after losing a semi-final to Papua New Guinea, with their opponent in the third-place playoff being the Cook Islands. The team's tournament was marked by several instances of individual brilliance, most notably an innings of 104 (off 74 balls) by Moelagi Tuilagi in the playoff, the first century in an EAP Twenty20 event. Samoa's captain, Auckland Hearts player Regina Lili'i, was named both player of the tournament and captain of the team of the tournament. Lili'i was one of three Samoan players with experience in the New Zealand State League, the others being Hana Mauafu (Canterbury Magicians) and Madeleine Chapman (Wellington Blaze). , one unofficial ranking system placed Samoa 27th in the world, behind Kenya. In July 2015, Samoa won the gold medal in the women's tournament at the 2015 Pacific Games in Port Moresby, becoming the first country outside of Papua New Guinea to win gold in Pacific Games cricket.\nIn December 2020, the ICC announced the qualification pathway for the 2023 ICC Women's T20 World Cup. Samoa were named in the 2021 ICC Women's T20 World Cup EAP Qualifier regional group, alongside seven other teams.\nCurrent squad.\n\"Updated on 12 January 2024\".\nThis lists all the players who have played for Samoa in the past 12 months or were part of the most recent squad.\nRecords and statistics.\nInternational Match Summary — Samoa Women\n\"Last updated 21 January 2024\"\nTwenty20 International.\nMost T20I runs for Samoa Women\nMost T20I wickets for Samoa Women\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to WT20I #1742.

        "title": "NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship",
        "text": "The NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship is an NCAA-sanctioned tournament to determine the national champions of collegiate women's beach volleyball. It is a National Collegiate Championship featuring teams from Division I, Division II and Division III, and is the 90th, and newest, NCAA championship event. It was the first new NCAA championship to be created since the NCAA Division III Men's Volleyball Championship in 2012, and the first for women since the NCAA Bowling Championship in 2004.\nHistory.\nThe championship was approved by the NCAA Convention during the fall of 2015, and a committee was selected to determine the tournament's organizational structure. Before 2015, sand volleyball had been part of the NCAA Emerging Sports for Women program (which included women's ice hockey, bowling, rowing, and water polo in the past). As such, a separate championship had been contested annually, since 2012, by the American Volleyball Coaches Association. Before 2012 several championships were televised by Collegiate Nationals. As of 2015, over 50 schools (from Divisions I, II, and III) had sponsored sand volleyball, ten more than the total number of required programs.\nThe sport's name was changed from \"sand volleyball\" to the more usual \"beach volleyball\" in June 2015, and the committee overseeing the sport is now named the NCAA Beach Volleyball Committee.\nStructure.\n2016–2021.\nThe championship is held each May. From 2016 through 2021, eight teams participated, in a double-elimination style tournament with a single-elimination final, under standard beach volleyball rules. All duals consist of five matches, with each team needing to win three matches to advance.\nThe NCAA does not add automatic qualifiers until two championship seasons have passed; but in 2016, the top 3 teams from the east and west were given automatic bids with 2 additional teams invited at-large.\nAs of fall 2019, seven conferences sponsor beach volleyball, all with at least six members — the minimum number for a conference to qualify for an automatic bid to other NCAA championship tournaments. Five of these conferences were represented in the inaugural tournament; the exceptions are the Ohio Valley Conference and Southland Conference, both of which begin beach volleyball sponsorship in the upcoming 2020 season. \n2022.\nFrom 2022 onwards, the championship tournament was expanded to 16 teams. As of spring 2022, eight conferences sponsor beach volleyball, and the winners of each conference will receive automatic bids for the championship.\nAdditionally, two teams from the East Region and two teams from the West Region will be given bids by the NCAA beach volleyball committee, while the final four teams will be selected at large.\n2023present.\nStarting in 2023, the tournament switched to a standard single elimination bracket from more complicated partially double elimination brackets used before. The field was also expanded to 17 teams to allow for nine automatic qualifiers.\nResult by school and by year.\nTwenty-one teams have appeared in the NCAA Tournament in at least one year starting with 2016. The results for all years are shown below. The code in each cell represents the furthest the team made it in the respective tournament.\n2016 to 2022\n2023 to present\nBroadcasting.\nTurner Sports held broadcast rights to the tournament for the first two years (2016 and 2017), with early-round coverage airing on TruTV, and the championship game broadcast on TBS. In December 2017, ESPN signed a multiyear agreement to broadcast the NCAA Women's Beach Volleyball Championship through 2022."

The procedure is common among collegiate and professional athletes in several sports, most notably baseball.\nThe procedure was first performed in 1974 by orthopedic surgeon Dr. Frank Jobe, then a Los Angeles Dodgers team physician. The surgery is named after Tommy John, the first recipient of the surgery. John won 288 games in his career – 124 before the surgery and 164 after. Many players have subsequently undergone the surgery, some more than once. Two players (Paul Molitor and John Smoltz) have undergone the surgery and been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Bryce Harper tore his UCL in April of 2022. Harper would play the rest of the season as the designated hitter and win the NLCS MVP for the Phillies. He would undergo the surgery shortly after the World Series loss and come back to hit in May 2023, which is one of the fastest recovery times for the surgery.\nList.\n Denotes a player that underwent the surgery on his non-throwing arm."

        "text": "Colin Andrew White (born January 30, 1997) is an American professional ice hockey center for the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected in the first round, 21st overall, by the Ottawa Senators in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. White has also previously played for the Florida Panthers and Pittsburgh Penguins.\nEarly life.\nWhite was born on January 30, 1997, in Hanover, Massachusetts to parents Mark and Christine. His father played collegiate football and track and field at Georgia Tech while his mother played tennis at Florida State University. He began ice skating after his sister had her eighth birthday party at an ice rink. Growing up, he rooted for the Pittsburgh Penguins and his favorite player was Mario Lemieux.\nPlaying career.\nWhite played high school ice hockey at Noble and Greenough School before joining the USA Hockey National Team Development Program (U.S. NTDP). As a member of the U.S. NTDP, he played the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons in the United States Hockey League (USHL). White's play was rewarded when he was invited to skate in the 2014 CCM/USA Hockey All-American Prospects Game. In his final season with the U.S. NTDP, White recorded 17 points in 20 games.\nWhite played college ice hockey at Boston College from 2015 to 2017. He scored his first collegiate hat-trick on January 8, 2016, against Providence. In 2015–16, White was named to the Hockey East All-Rookie Team.\nWhite was selected in the first round, 21st overall, by the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League (NHL) in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. Following the 2016-17 NCAA season, White signed an amateur tryout with the Senators' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Binghamton Senators, on March 26. He recorded three points in three games. On April 2, the Ottawa Senators signed White to a three-year, entry-level contract. He made his NHL debut the following day in a 5–4 loss to the Detroit Red Wings. He made his NHL post-season debut in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Final against the Pittsburgh Penguins on May 23.\nWhite split his first professional season between Ottawa and Binghamton. On February 6, 2018, he recorded his first career NHL goal in a 5–3 win over the New Jersey Devils. He finished his first season in Ottawa with six points in 21 games. In his first full season with Ottawa, White recorded 14 goals and 41 points in 71 games. On August 21, 2019, the Senators signed White to a six-year, $28.5 million contract extension.\nOn October 5, 2021, White sustained an upper-body injury five minutes into a pre-season game against the Toronto Maple Leafs after a collision with David Kämpf. He was expected to miss four to six months to recover from shoulder surgery. White later returned in the 2021–22 season to record three goals and 10 points through 24 games.\nHaving been affected through injury and failing to live up to his contract expectations, on July 5, 2022, White was placed on unconditional waivers by the Senators and upon clearing was bought out from the remaining three-years of his contract. On the opening day of free agency, White was signed to a one-year, $1.2 million contract with the Florida Panthers on July 13, 2022. He finished the season with eight goals and fifteen points in 68 games and was a restricted free agent following its conclusion. However, the Panthers chose not to give him a qualifying offer and instead let White become an unrestricted free agent on July 1, 2023.\nWhite signed a professional tryout (PTO) agreement with the Pittsburgh Penguins on September 9, 2023. He was invited to training camp and was one of five forwards working for the final two spots on the roster after the penultimate round of cuts. On October 7, White signed a one-year deal with the Penguins. However, he was assigned to the Penguins AHL affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, to start the 2023–24 season. White was limited to 21 games in the AHL due to injuries, scoring five goals and ten points. He was recalled by Pittsburgh on January 13, 2024. He made his Pittsburgh debut that night against the Carolina Hurricanes.\nFollowing an 11-game stint with the Penguins in which he was held pointless, White was claimed off waivers by the Montreal Canadiens on February 22, 2024. He made his debut for the Canadiens that night against the Penguins.\nInternational play.\nWhite competed as a member of Team USA at the 2014 IIHF World U17 Championships, where he set a USA record of 18 points in six games. He helped lead Team USA to a Gold medal defeating Canada in the championship game. He was named to the tournament's all-star team. He competed as a member of Team USA at the 2015 IIHF World U18 Championships, where he scored the overtime game-winning goal to defeat Finland in the gold medal game.\nWhite represented Team USA at the 2016 IIHF World Junior Championships, where he helped Team USA win a bronze medal in Helsinki, Finland. In 2017, he returned as a member of Team USA at the 2017 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, where he scored to tie the game that went to overtime in which USA defeated Canada in the gold medal game.\nAfter the Senators failed to qualify for the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs, White was named to represent Team USA's 2018 IIHF World Championship roster. The United States claimed the bronze medal in Denmark. On April 19, 2019, White was selected to represent Team USA at the 2019 IIHF World Championship, held in Bratislava and Kosice, Slovakia. Team USA made it to the quarterfinals but were eliminated by Russia 4–3."

It was the 20th final in the Super Rugby competition's history and the fifth under the expanded 15-team format. This was the first Super Rugby final between two New Zealand teams since 2006 when the Hurricanes were beaten by the Crusaders.\nThe match was won by the Highlanders who beat the Hurricanes by seven points. Upon winning the match, the Highlanders became the first team to win the competition having failed to win a conference. They also became the first team to win the competition having played in the qualifiers round.\nIn New Zealand, 583,620 people tuned in to watch\nRoad to the Final.\nThe 2015 Super Rugby competition involved fifteen teams, five each from South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The 2015 season was the fifth year of an expanded 15 team format (12 teams competed between 1996 and 2005, before increasing to 14 between 2006 and 2010).\nThe competition began on 13 February with the regular season consisting of 120 matches over eighteen weeks. Each team played the others from their own conference (both home and away), plus four out of five teams from the other two countries (two at home and two away in each case). The top six teams after the regular season advanced to the finals.\nThe Hurricanes finished top of the New Zealand conference and topped the overall standings, with fourteen wins and just two losses during the season (one being to the Australian conference winner, the Waratahs). The South African conference winner was the Stormers, and the three wildcard teams making the playoffs were the Highlanders, Chiefs, and Brumbies.\nThe play-off fixtures were as follows:"

        "title": "2017 UEFA Champions League final",
        "text": "The 2017 UEFA Champions League final was the final match of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League, the 62nd season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 25th season since it was renamed from the European Cup to the UEFA Champions League. It was played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales on 3 June 2017, between Italian side Juventus and Spanish side and title holders Real Madrid, in a repeat of the 1998 final. It would also be the first European Cup final held under a closed roof. Real Madrid won the match 4–1 to secure their 12th title in this competition. With this victory, Real Madrid became the first team to successfully defend their title since Milan in 1990. Meanwhile, Juventus lost their fifth consecutive Champions League final and its seventh overall in nine total finals reached.\nReal Madrid qualified as the UEFA representative at the 2017 FIFA Club World Cup in the United Arab Emirates, and also earned the right to play against the winners of the 2016–17 UEFA Europa League, Manchester United, in the 2017 UEFA Super Cup, triumphing in both competitions.\nTeams.\n\"In the following table, finals until 1992 were in the European Cup era, since 1993 were in the UEFA Champions League era.\"\nVenue.\nThe Millennium Stadium was announced as the final venue on 30 June 2015, following the decision of the UEFA Executive Committee meeting in Prague, Czech Republic. The stadium entered into a naming rights deal with the Principality Building Society in 2016 that saw it renamed as the \"Principality Stadium\"; however, due to UEFA regulations regarding the use of names of non-tournament sponsors, they continue to use the name \"Millennium Stadium\" in official literature, while the name \"National Stadium of Wales\" was used for the final itself.\nShortly before the final date of 3 June 2017, it was announced that for security reasons the retractable roof would be closed. This marked the first and so far only time that the UEFA Champions League final was held indoors.\nBackground.\nThe match was a repeat of the 1998 final, making it the eighth repeated final pairing. Real Madrid won the 1998 final 1–0. The 2017 final was the first time since the two teams met in 1998 that both finalists had won either their domestic league or the Champions League the previous season.\nJuventus reached their ninth final after a 4–1 aggregate win against Monaco to maintain their undefeated record in this season's competition. Juventus also entered the final with the best defensive record in the 2016–17 Champions League, having conceded only three times. Previously Juventus won finals in 1985 and 1996, and lost a record six in 1973, 1983, 1997, 1998, 2003 and 2015. This was also their 14th final in all seasonal UEFA competitions, having also played in one Cup Winners' Cup final (winning in 1984) and four UEFA Cup finals (winning in 1977, 1990 and 1993, and losing in 1995). If they were to lose, Juventus would tie Benfica's record of five consecutive finals lost.\nTitle holders Real Madrid reached a record 15th final after a 4–2 aggregate win against city rivals Atlético Madrid, knocking them out of the competition for the fourth consecutive season. Real Madrid went into the final as top scorers of the 2016–17 Champions League, having scored 32 goals. This final was their third since 2014, and gave Real a chance to win a record 12th title. Previously they won finals in 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1966, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2014 and 2016, and lost in 1962, 1964 and 1981. This was also their 19th final in all seasonal UEFA competitions, having also played in two Cup Winners' Cup finals (losing in 1971 and 1983) and two UEFA Cup finals (winning in 1985 and 1986). Real Madrid were looking to be the first team in the Champions League era (since 1993) to win two consecutive finals. Four times prior the previous champions had advanced to the final (Milan in 1995, Ajax in 1996, Juventus in 1997, and Manchester United in 2009), but on all occasions the title holders lost.\nThe two sides had previously met eighteen times in European competitions, all in the European Cup/UEFA Champions League, with a record of eight wins each and two draws. The first meeting between the two sides took place in the 1961–62 European Cup quarter-finals, where Real Madrid beat Juventus 3–1 in a play-off after the two sides exchanged 1–0 away wins. The most recent meeting between the clubs had taken place in the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, where Juventus won 3–2 on aggregate to advance to the 2015 final.\nJuventus entered the final chasing their first treble of domestic league, domestic cup, and Champions League titles, bidding to become the ninth team to win it. They won the 2016–17 Coppa Italia after defeating Lazio in the final on 17 May, and clinched the 2016–17 Serie A title on 21 May. Real Madrid were chasing the double of domestic league and Champions League titles, having won the 2016–17 La Liga on 21 May, the final day of the season.\nRoad to the final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\"\nPre-match.\nAmbassador.\nThe ambassador for the final was former Wales international Ian Rush, who won the European Cup with Liverpool in 1984, and also played for Juventus from 1987 to 1988.\nLogo.\nUEFA unveiled the brand identity of the final on 25 August 2016 in Monaco during the group stage draw.\nTicketing.\nWith a stadium capacity of 66,000 for the final, a total of 41,500 tickets were available to fans and the general public; the two finalist teams received 18,000 tickets each and 5,500 tickets were made available for sale to fans worldwide via \"UEFA.com\" from 17 to 28 March 2017 in four price categories: £390, £275, £140, and £60. The remaining tickets were allocated to the local organising committee, UEFA and national associations, commercial partners and broadcasters, and to serve the corporate hospitality programme.\nOpening ceremony.\nAmerican hip-hop group The Black Eyed Peas performed at the opening ceremony, which included a pyrotechnic display that ran over time and delayed the kick-off for several minutes. The UEFA Champions League Anthem featured a recording of Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli from the previous season's final.\nRelated events.\nThe 2017 UEFA Women's Champions League final was held two days prior, on 1 June 2017, at the Cardiff City Stadium, with title holders Lyon beating Paris Saint-Germain 7–6 on penalties, following a 0–0 draw after extra time. The winning penalty was scored by Lyon goalkeeper Sarah Bouhaddi, immediately after her opposite number, Katarzyna Kiedrzynek, had missed her kick.\nThe annual UEFA Champions Festival was held between 1–4 June 2017 at Cardiff Bay.\nMatch.\nOfficials.\nIn May 2017, German referee Felix Brych was selected to supervise the final. He was joined by fellow German officials Mark Borsch and Stefan Lupp as assistant referees, Bastian Dankert and Marco Fritz as additional assistant referees, Rafael Foltyn as reserve assistant referee, and Serbian Milorad Mažić as fourth official.\nSummary.\nJuventus dominated possession in the opening 19 minutes of the match, and had three major chances to score. Gonzalo Higuaín had two shots on goal that were easily saved by Keylor Navas, while Miralem Pjanić had a more dangerous chance that Navas dived to push wide to his right. Despite the scoring chances, as well as the closing down of Real Madrid's counterattacks in the midfield, Cristiano Ronaldo scored the first goal of the match in the 20th minute; Dani Carvajal played a one-two on the right with Ronaldo before passing across for him to shoot low to the left corner of the net, which deflected in off the right foot of Leonardo Bonucci. Juventus responded with a goal seven minutes later to bring the score to 1–1. Mario Mandžukić chested down a ball from Higuaín and hooked the ball over his shoulder from , which arced over Navas. The goal was heralded as one of the best goals ever scored in a Champions League final and was compared to Zinedine Zidane's goal in the 2002 final for Real Madrid. Juventus remained in control through the end of the first half, while Real Madrid conceded two yellow cards for defenders Sergio Ramos and Dani Carvajal.\nReal Madrid began the second half strongly and in control, though play was stopped several times for fouls and injuries to both sides. Real Madrid took a 2–1 lead in the 61st minute from a long-range strike from Casemiro, which deflected off Sami Khedira and past Gianluigi Buffon to the left corner of the net. Three minutes later, Ronaldo scored Madrid's third goal of the night and his second, finishing in the box from a cut-back from Luka Modrić on the right. Juventus, fending off additional attacks from Madrid, picked up three additional yellow cards, including one to newly substituted Juan Cuadrado. Real Madrid replaced striker Karim Benzema with Gareth Bale, a Cardiff native who had not been fit enough to start but was given a homecoming. Cuadrado picked up a second yellow card and was sent off in the 84th minute for a shove on Sergio Ramos, who went down while holding his foot. Marco Asensio scored Madrid's fourth and final goal in the 90th minute, a tap-in from after a cut-back from Marcelo from the left.\nDetails.\nThe \"home\" team (for administrative purposes) was determined by an additional draw held after the semi-final draw, which was held on 21 April 2017 at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPost-match.\nThe trophy presentation returned to the pitch for the first time since 2006 when Barcelona collected the trophy. UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin said \"The pitch is the players' stage and it is only fitting that their achievements are celebrated there\", The European Cup was then presented to Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos to commemorate the first team to win it the back-to-back.\nWith their win, Real Madrid secured a record-extending twelfth title in the European Cup/Champions League and became the first club to win back-to-back titles in the Champions League era. This was the club's third title win in four seasons; a feat that has only occurred thrice before – Real Madrid (1956–60), Ajax (1971–73) and Bayern Munich (1974–76). Real Madrid has not lost a final in the Champions League era, with their last defeat occurring in 1981. The victory also saw Madrid secure their first League – European Cup double since the 1957–58 season. Madrid's first goal in the final marked their 500th all-time goal in the competition, becoming the first club to reach the milestone. Cristiano Ronaldo also became the first player to score in three Champions League finals, and ranking second with the European Cup included, only behind Alfredo Di Stéfano's five finals scored in. Twenty-one year old Asensio became the youngest Real Madrid player to score in a European Cup/Champions League final.\nWith their loss, Juventus extended their record number of final losses to seven, and tied Benfica's record of five consecutive finals lost.\nReactions.\nAt the post-match press conference, Allegri stated that Juventus had played well in the first-half but failed to make the most of their chances. He felt that his team \"let go psychologically\" after conceding the second goal. Allegri added, \"Even if Real Madrid had a very good second half and have excellent players who can change the game at any moment, that second goal knocked the wind out of our sails. They raised the tempo, as we were the ones pushing Real Madrid back in the first half, but in the second we couldn't play our way out of defence and they kept pushing us back. At that moment, we should've taken out the extra energy to push hard and keep the game open, as we know Real Madrid leave you the chances to score at all times, but we conceded the third goal and that was really damaging.\" Juventus captain Buffon stated that losing the match was a big disappointment. He felt his side had \"an excellent first half, where we caused Real Madrid huge problems\" but \"in the second half their class, strength and how accustomed they are to winning these games showed through. They won deservedly.\" If Juventus had won, Buffon would have become the oldest player to win a Champions League surpassing compatriot Paolo Maldini. FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who attended the match, told reporters, \"Juventus played a great first half, then in the second Real Madrid were extraordinary. They were two excellent sides and in the end the best team won.\"\nZidane declared that his players deserved to win the double and become the first team to defend the title in the Champions league era. Zidane stated, \"They have made history, for sure. Nobody has done it, and now we have. Today is a historic day for all Madridistas, for the players, for me, for all our family. But saying this, you know how it is. Next year will be much more difficult. We will have to work a lot to try and win again. But today we can say we are a very good team, and we deserved to win La Liga and the Champions League. It was not easy.\" He also felt that \"a lot of hard work\" was the reason behind the team's success. Zidane also revealed that he had instructed his players to \"keep going, but to play a bit higher up the pitch, and to keep the ball\" during the half-time team talk.\nRamos said he was proud that Madrid had \"kept their date with history\" and felt it was because of the harmonious relationship among the players. Madrid's captain said, \"We are tremendously proud of this team, and this institution. We had a date with history and were really looking forward to it. For 59 years we had not achieved the double, and nobody had ever won two Champions Leagues in a row. We were able to keep a dressing room without any jealousies and that was key. Success does not come by coincidence. We are a great group, headed by a great coach in Zidane. Three Champions Leagues in four years is crazy.\" Kroos revealed that he did not believe that Madrid would be able to successfully defend the trophy saying, \"I didn't expect it would be possible to defend this title as it's so difficult to win it once. But to do it twice in a row is unbelievable. To win it three times in the last four years means a lot. It means it's not only a good team on the pitch but off the pitch. It's like that and I'm happy to be part of the team.\" Kroos also pointed out that Juventus had only conceded three goals in their entire Champions League campaign, and that scoring four against them in the final was a sign of Madrid's quality.\nModrić said that Madrid's performance in the first half was because they had \"dropped back too much\". He felt that the team's performance improved in the second half after Zidane instructed them to become \"more aggressive\" and \"to not allow Juve to keep the ball easily\". Cardiff native Bale stated that winning the title in his hometown was a \"great feeling\". He also stated that he had no regrets about not being able to start the match, and was happy to have been able to play.\n2017 Turin stampede.\nDuring a viewing event for the match at the Piazza San Carlo in Turin, a robbery attempt followed by a loud bang caused panic, and a subsequent stampede killed three people, and at least 1,672 people were injured. On 14 May 2019, the victims of the tragedy were commemorated with a plaque in the piazza."

        "title": "David Andrews (American football)",
        "text": "James David Andrews (born July 10, 1992) is an American football center for the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Georgia Bulldogs.\nEarly years.\nAndrews attended Wesleyan School in Peachtree Corners, Georgia, where he was a two-way lineman. In his sophomore year, Wesleyan won the 2008 GHSA Class A state championship. For his junior and senior seasons, his coaches attributed him with over a hundred knockdown blocks while not allowing a quarterback sack. Andrews was named 2010 Gwinnett County Offensive Lineman of the Year and made the All-County First-team Offense of the \"Gwinnett Daily Post\".\nRegarded as a three-star recruit by \"Rivals.com\", Andrews was ranked as the No. 9 center prospect in the class of 2011, which was headed by Reese Dismukes. Andrews had offers from Duke and Michigan but, as a “lifelong die-hard Bulldogs fan,” waited for Georgia to offer and committed “practically on the spot” when he got the offer in February 2010.\nCollege career.\nIn his true freshman season at Georgia, Andrews appeared in ten games. He earned Athletic Director's Honor Roll distinction for fall semester. In his sophomore year, Andrews filled the void left at center by the graduation of Ben Jones. Andrews started all 14 games, helping to protect quarterback Aaron Murray. After the Auburn game in early November, he was named Southeastern Conference (SEC) Offensive Lineman of the Week as he graded out at 88 percent and had six “dominator” blocks and three knockdowns.\nAs a junior, Andrews was named to the preseason watch list for the Rimington Trophy. He started all 13 games at center and protected quarterback Murray such that Georgia ranked second in passing in the SEC. At the conclusion of spring practice of his senior year, he was named Offensive MVP, and also preseason Third-team All-SEC by Phil Steele. Andrews added another 13 starts in as many games over his senior season, totaling 50 games for his college career. He won Georgia's Vince Dooley Most Valuable Player Award, was selected second-team All-SEC by the \"Associated Press\", and was named one of six finalists for the Rimington Trophy.\nProfessional career.\nAndrews went undrafted in the 2015 NFL draft, but signed with the New England Patriots as a free agent on May 8, 2015. He stood out at Patriot training camp and played more than expected in preseason, starting every preseason game due to injuries to starting center Bryan Stork and reserve center/guard Ryan Wendell. Andrews made the Patriots 2015 53-man roster and started at center in Week 1 against the Pittsburgh Steelers after Stork was placed on injured reserve with the designation to return and Wendell was inactive. Andrews started every game through Week 10, playing every snap over the first half of the season. Although he was not selected to the 2016 Pro Bowl, Andrews finished in the top two in fan voting at the position. As a result of his high snap count and low salary, Andrews received a performance-based pay bonus of $237,427.11, the second-highest of any Patriot in 2015 (after cornerback Malcolm Butler).\nIn 2016, Andrews faced competition from Bryan Stork for the starting center job and ultimately won, leading to Stork's release from the team. He started all 16 regular-season games for the Patriots on an offensive line that led the team to a 14–2 record. Andrews started in Super Bowl LI against the Atlanta Falcons in the first overtime game and largest comeback in Super Bowl history; the Patriots trailed 28–3 late in the third quarter, but rallied to win by a score of 34–28.\nOn May 12, 2017, Andrews signed a three-year contract extension with the Patriots through the 2020 season. The deal has a base value of $9.6 million, with a $1.6 million signing bonus, and an additional $2.1 million in incentives. On September 5, 2017, Andrews was named a Patriots captain for the first time in his career. Andrews started 17 of 19 games for the Patriots, including their Super Bowl LII loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.\nAndrews once again started all 16 games at center for the Patriots in 2018. Andrews helped the Patriots reach their third straight Super Bowl appearance after they defeated Los Angeles Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs in the playoffs; they defeated the Los Angeles Rams by a score of 13–3 in Super Bowl LIII. Andrews had a fumble recovery in the victory.\nOn August 26, 2019, it was revealed that Andrews was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism, putting his 2019 season in jeopardy. He was placed on season-ending injured reserve on August 31, 2019.\nAndrews returned to the Patriots starting lineup in 2020 after missing all of 2019. On September 26, 2020, he was placed on injured reserve after undergoing surgery on his thumb. He was activated on October 24.\nOn March 22, 2021, Andrews re-signed with the Patriots on a four-year deal.\nPersonal life.\nAndrews and his wife Mackenzie were married on April 8, 2017. His uncle, the late Dan Reeves, played and coached in the NFL."

        "text": "The 2016 Giro d'Italia was the 99th edition of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tour races. The Giro started in Apeldoorn on 6 May with a individual time trial, followed by two other stages in the Netherlands, both between Nijmegen and Arnhem. After a rest day, there were 18 further stages to reach the finish on 29 May. These stages were principally in Italy, although two stages partly took place in France.\nThe overall winner was Italian rider Vincenzo Nibali of team Astana, who won his second Giro.\nTeams.\nAll 18 UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited and were obliged to attend the race. The first wildcard invitation was secured at the end of the 2015 cycling season by . While riding as , they won the season-long \"Coppa Italia\" series; the winners of the series are automatically awarded an entry into the following year's Giro d'Italia. Two of the remaining three wildcard places were awarded to Italian teams ( and ); the final place was awarded to the Russian team . There were therefore 22 teams in the Giro, each of which consisted of nine riders; there are therefore 198 riders in the peloton at the beginning of the race.\nPre-race favorites.\nPre-race favorites were Vincenzo Nibali, Mikel Landa, Alejandro Valverde, Ilnur Zakarin, Rigoberto Urán, Rafał Majka, Tom Dumoulin, Domenico Pozzovivo, Jakob Fuglsang.\nRoute and stages.\nDetails about the start of the Giro were unveiled on 26 June 2015. It was confirmed that the Netherlands would hold its third (Big Start) of the Giro, having previously hosted the opening stages of the 2002 and 2010 editions. The stages in the Netherlands will include an individual time trial on the opening day, followed by two road stages suitable for sprinters; to allow for the long transfer, there will be a rest day after the third stage. Stage 9, a individual time trial, was announced at a press conference in London on 7 September 2015 and the mountainous Stage 13 was confirmed at a press conference on 21 September 2015. The remainder of the route was unveiled by the race director, Mauro Vegni, on 5 October 2015. After the three stages in the Netherlands, the race moves to Calabria in the south of Italy. The route generally takes the riders north, frequently visiting the Apennines, with stages in the mountains of Friuli and the Dolomites coming later in the race. The final and most difficult part of the Giro comes in the final week, with stages in the Alps.\nAfter a series of moderately hilly stages, the first summit finish comes at the end of Stage 6. It is followed by two more hilly stages, the second of which includes a (dirt) climb in the final . The ninth stage is expected to be one of the most important for deciding the overall winner of the race: it is a individual time trial through the Chianti region. The second rest day followed the time trial. After the rest day, Stage 10 includes the second summit finish of the race – although it was only a third-category climb – which came at the end of a very hilly second half of the stage. After two fairly flat stages, the race again enters the mountains towards the end of the second week, with the difficult Stage 13 ending with two mountains shortly before the finish in Cividale del Friuli. The second weekend takes place in the Dolomites: Stage 14 includes six major climbs, while Stage 15 is a mountain time trial to Alpe di Siusi. After the final rest day, the third week of the Giro begins with a rolling stage that includes a climb in the final , then two more fairly flat days. Stages 19 and 20 again take the riders into the high mountains: Stage 19 finishes on the climb of Risoul in France, then Stage 20 includes three first-category climbs on the way to another summit finish. The final stage takes place over a sprinter-friendly circuit in Turin.\nAfter the start in the Netherlands, the Stages 19 and 20 leave Italy and visit France. In comparison with the previous year's race, the race was shorter; it contained one more rest day and two more individual time trials. Unlike the previous edition, there was no team time trial.\nRace overview.\nThe race began with an individual time trial in Apeldoorn. Fabian Cancellara was the favourite, aiming to become the leader of the Giro for the first time in his career. But a stomach bug left him eighth on the stage, and instead, home rider Tom Dumoulin powered through to win. He had the same time as second placed Primož Roglič, while Costa Rican rider, Andrey Amador, came in third, six seconds behind. Ultimately, the Dutchman took honours and collected the first \"Maglia Rosa\" of the race. The next two stages in the Netherlands, held between Nijmegen and Arnhem, were both won by Marcel Kittel. Having lost 11 seconds in the opening time trial, the two ten second time bonuses gave the German the pink jersey after the third stage.\nAfter an early rest day, the race resumed in the south of Italy, with a hilly affair. Diego Ulissi took stage honours, after attacking on the final third category climb. Kittel was dropped on the same ascent and, together with Dumoulin's finish in second place, meant that the Dutchman regained the \"Maglia Rosa\". Stage 5 was flat, and won by André Greipel. The sixth stage, however, was seen as an important one – it was the first summit finish of the Giro, in Roccaraso. It was won by Tim Wellens, who joined the successful breakaway partway through the stage. Amongst the GC contenders, Dumoulin gained approximately ten seconds over his rivals, and secured himself in the \"Maglia Rosa\". Vincenzo Nibali lost seconds, due to bad team tactics from . Greipel took stage 7, 's third consecutive victory.\nStage 8 featured the (dirt) climb of Alpe di Poti. Gianluca Brambilla took the victory in Arezzo. However, behind him, a battle amongst the general classification favourites commenced. Dumoulin was dropped, and lost a minute to the other favourites while Brambilla's advantage was sufficient to give him the pink jersey, the first Italian to wear it during the 2016 Giro. The next stage, the Chianti Classico Stage, was won by Roglič; his first ever victory in a Grand tour stage. The stage was held in falling rain, and this influenced the times of the GC favourites. Bob Jungels moved behind Brambilla, but failed to take the jersey, thanks to a one-second difference. Mikel Landa also moved forward in the general classification despite being expected to lose time. Stage 10 was the second summit finish, in Sestola, and was won by Giulio Ciccone. Landa climbed off after suffering from fever while Brambilla sacrificed his maglia rosa to work for his teammate, Jungels, who proceeded to take the maglia rosa at the day's end. Stage 11 was a fairly flat stage but there was a late fourth category climb where moves were expected to be made. Dumoulin, suffering from saddle sores, departed the Giro at the stage's feed zone while Amador attacked the favourites with 13 kilometers to go. Maglia rosa wearer, Jungels, tracked his move while Ulissi came back on the descent. The trio worked together to stay away with Ulissi winning the stage in the sprint while Jungels extended his lead further. The next stage was a flat stage, with Greipel winning his third stage in the race. Greipel, along with some sprinters, withdrew from the race after the stage.\nThe next few stages before the third rest day were expected to be crucial in terms of the GC. Stage 13 was won by Mikel Nieve of while Jungels was dropped on the final ascent. Amador was also dropped briefly on the climb before coming back on the descent, taking the maglia rosa in the process as Jungels lost 50 seconds. Stage 14 was the queen stage of the race, featuring six categorized climbs before the descent to Corvara. Esteban Chaves took the stage honors after outsprinting Steven Kruijswijk, who took the maglia rosa, and Georg Preidler. Nibali lit up the fight for the GC on the final climb to Valparola, attacking with 27 kilometers to go. His attack dropped Amador and Alejandro Valverde, who both lost three minutes on the stage. Kruijswijk would attack close to the summit, with Chaves, after dropping Nibali, the only rider to keep up with him. Nibali lost more than half a minute after the stage. Stage 15 was the third individual time trial of the race, featuring the ascent to Alpe di Siusi. Alexander Foliforov surprised the GC favorites to win the stage, narrowly beating Kruijswijk by around a hundredth of a second. Kruijswijk extended his lead to more than two minutes over second-placed Chaves as Nibali suffered a mechanical on the climb, losing more than two minutes in the process. Stage 16 was a short stage which was won by Valverde, who outsprinted Kruijswijk on the line. Kruijswijk extended his lead in the general classification to three minutes as Chaves lost 42 seconds while Nibali cracked on the last climb. He lost almost two minutes to drop to fourth overall, almost five minutes down. Stage 17 was a pan flat stage, with Roger Kluge of winning after surprising the remaining sprinters with an attack in the final kilometer. The win happened two days after his team announced its folding at the end of the season.\nStage 18 was another fairly flat stage but the stage included a late second category climb to Pramartino and the uncategorized ascent of San Maurizio. Matteo Trentin won from a breakaway while the GC contenders finished around 14 minutes behind. Stage 19 was the first to head into the high mountains, featuring the Cima Coppi, the Colle Dell'Agnello, and the summit finish to Risoul in France. Michele Scarponi took the Cima Coppi while Valverde, Ilnur Zakarin and Rafał Majka were dropped. On the descent, both Kruijswijk and Zakarin crashed with Zakarin suffered a broken collarbone and shoulder blade, forcing him to withdraw from the race. The day proved to be a redemption for Nibali as he won the stage after dropping Chaves on the climb to Risoul. Meanwhile, Kruijswijk crossed the line almost five minutes down on Nibali and more than four minutes behind Chaves. Chaves took the maglia rosa with a 44-second advantage over Nibali as Kruijswijk, who would later be diagnosed with a fractured rib, fell to third overall at a minute and five seconds behinds. Stage 20 was the final decisive stage in terms of the general classification, with three first category climbs on the menu and the steep third category climb to the finish at Sant'Anna di Vinadio. Nibali attack started 4 km to the summit of Lombarda, and reached the GPM 56 seconds ahead of Chaves. In the last 10 kilometers its progression was irresistible reaching the end of the stage at Sanctuary of Sant’Anna with 1’36\" on Chaves, becoming the new and last maglia rosa of the giro d'Italia number 99. The podium was completed by Chaves, second, and Valverde.\nClassification leadership.\nIn the Giro d'Italia, four different jerseys are awarded. The first and most important is the general classification, calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. Riders receive time bonuses (10, 6 and 4 seconds respectively) for finishing in the first three places on each stage (excluding the team time trial and individual time trial). The rider with the lowest cumulative time is awarded the pink jersey (the \"maglia rosa\") and is considered the winner of the Giro d'Italia.\nAdditionally, there is a points classification. Riders win points for finishing in the top 15 on each stage. Flat stages award more points that mountainous stages, meaning that this classification tends to favour sprinters. In addition, points can be won in intermediate sprints. The winner of the points classification win the red jersey.\nThere is also a mountains classification. Points are awarded for reaching the top of a climb towards the front of the race. Each climb will be categorized as either first, second, third, or fourth-category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awards more points than the other first-category climbs. At , the \"Cima Coppi\" for the 2016 Giro d'Italia is the Col Agnel.\nThe fourth jersey represents the young rider classification. This is decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1991 are eligible. The winner of the classification is awarded a white jersey.\nThere are also two classifications for teams. In the Trofeo Fast Team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage are added up; the leading team is one with the lowest total time. The Trofeo Super Team is a team points classification, with the top 20 riders of each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team.\nFinal standings.\nMinor classifications.\nSeveral other minor classifications are awarded. The first is the intermediate sprint classification. Each road stage has two sprints – the \"Traguardi Volanti\". The first riders across the intermediate sprint lines are awarded points; the rider with the most points at the end of the race wins the classification. This classification was won by Daniel Oss (). Another classification – the combativity prize () – involves points awarded to the first riders at the stage finishes, at intermediate sprints, and at the summits of categorised climbs. It was won by Matteo Trentin (). There is also a breakaway award (). For this, points are awarded to each rider in any breakaway smaller than 10 riders that escapes for at least . Each rider is awarded a point for each kilometre that the rider was away from the peloton. The rider with the most points at the end of the Giro wins the award. It was also won by Daniel Oss (). The final classification is a \"fair play\" ranking for each team. Teams are given penalty points for infringing various rules. These range from half-point penalties, for offences that merit warnings from race officials, to a 2000-point penalty, for a positive doping test. The team that has the lowest points total at the end of the Giro wins the classification. It was won by that did not receive any penalty points during the Giro, like 4 other teams. However, out of all of them, they had the highest placed rider in the general classification."

        "text": "The Fordham University Rugby Football Club, or FURFC, is a collegiate rugby union team that represents Fordham University. It competes in the Liberty Rugby Conference at a D1A level. Like other Fordham University athletic teams, Fordham ruggers are called the Fordham Rams. With over 100 members, Fordham Rugby is one of the most popular athletic club sports teams at Fordham.\nHistory.\nThe Fordham University Rugby Football Club celebrated its 50th Anniversary Season in 2012, making it one of the oldest rugby teams in New York City. FURFC's stated mission is to display a commitment through strength of effort embodied in physical perseverance and mental determination. Fordham Rugby embodies the values of collaboration, dedication, and individual responsibility to the whole in all aspects of life. In recent years, an additional emphasis on community service has reinforced the Club's commitment to the University's Jesuit ideals. FURFC is often referred to as \"The Bronx's Oldest and Toughest Brotherhood.\" This is exemplified by many FURFC alumni who go on to participate in Fordham's Old Maroon Rugby Football Club which is based out of the Bronx as well. Notable alumni include Ryan McTiernan, Edward Cullen, and Mike Durant(all former USA U-20 Eagles) as well as Tony Reali (host of ESPN's Around the Horn).\nSeptember 11, 2001.\nLike the rest of the New York community and American nation, Fordham Rugby was personally struck by the attacks on 9/11. In the collapse of the Twin Towers, six FURFC alumni where tragically taken: Michael Armstrong, Matthew J. Burke, Christopher Robert Clarke, Thomas Anthony Mahon, Christian Maltby, and John McDowell Jr. Fordham Rugby remembers all those who perished, especially its own fallen brothers. FURFC maintains a tradition of remembering these six individuals before they take the pitch for every match.\nScholarship.\nMichael J. Breslin III died on May 15, 1987, while a senior at Fordham University. He was remembered by his family, friends, and FURFC through the Michael J. Breslin III Scholarship Fund. The fund assists students of Fordham College at Rose Hill and the Gabelli School of Business in the payment of tuition expenses, with preference given to members of the Fordham University Rugby Football Club. The recipients are selected by the deans of Fordham College at Rose Hill and the Gabelli School of Business on the basis of academic achievement and financial need.\nRecords and highlights.\nFordham Rugby has consistently performed well both nationally and regionally, most recently in 2009 when FURFC reached the NRU D1 Playoff Final Four and were crowned Metropolitan New York D1 Champions. In 2009 FURFC also won the storied Cherry Blossoms Tournament. The year prior in 2008, FURFC fell short of the title and finished runner-up in the Metropolitan New York D1 final. In April 2016, Fordham Rugby won the Empire Rugby Conference 7s Championship Series. By winning the Empire Conference, Fordham Rugby's 7s Team qualified to compete for a national title at the USA Rugby College 7s National Championships. The team was also a D1 regional power during the 1990s despite sharing the division with perennial champion Army, who regularly appeared in the national title game during this period. Fordham was Army's toughest division rival during these years and regularly finished near the top of the conference. From 1992 to 1996, Fordham qualified for the national championship playoffs playing Harvard, UConn, Navy, and Buffalo respectively in the national tournament during these years. Fordham was also runner-up in the Metropolitan New York Division in 1992, 1993 and 1994. In 1996, Fordham Rugby finished as champions of the Metropolitan New York Division and was among the final 16 teams representing the east in the national championship tournament and graduated three All-American players.\nAcademics &amp; community service.\nAlthough it competes at the highest intercollegiate level, Fordham Rugby is officially a club sport as determined by the Fordham Athletics Department. Membership is open to any Fordham undergraduate. As such, FURFC membership reflects the diversity of Fordham. The Club's emphasis on academic achievement is evident in the high number of student-athletes who are members of the Fordham Honor's College or routinely qualify for the Dean's List. In addition to their many academic accomplishments, the Fordham University Rugby Football Club fulfills regular service commitments to the St. Baldrick's Foundation, The American Red Cross and a host of other organizations and non-profits dedicated to the betterment of the community.\nFacilities.\nFURFC's historic home pitch is Murphy Field situated on Fordham's Historic Rose Hill campus. In addition to Murphy Field, FURFC makes occasional use of Coffey Field, Fordham's football complex."

First ice hockey match was played by Ilirija and Kamnik on 7. February 1932. Ilirija had no competition in Kingdom of Yugoslavia and they had to wait until new clubs were founded in Zagreb and Karlovac. In 1939 Ilrija squad and three players from Zagreb formed Yugoslavia national ice hockey team, which played on World Ice Hockey Championships in Switzerland. In the same year Yugoslav Ice Hockey League was first played and Ilirija won all the titles until the World War II.\nAfter the war Socialist Yugoslavia was formed and other republics took primacy in yugoslav ice hockey. SR Slovenia was at first represented in yugoslav league only by a team from Ljubljana, later named HK Olimpija, that lost pre-war strength and won its first title only in 1972. Game spread and Ljubljana was soon joined with new teams from Jesenice, Celje, Vevče and Brežice. Specially HK Jesenice became a force in yugoslav ice hockey, they won first league title in 1957 and went on to win 23 titles until 1991. Slovenian players of Jesenice and Olimpija had main role in yugoslav national team, that never managed any major results at international competitions. The biggest success of Yugoslavia was winning Group B at the 1968 Winter Olympics. Zvone Šuvak (Jesenice) is national team all-time top scorer, while Edo Hafner (Jesenice) earned most caps.\nAfter the Independence of Slovenia in 1991 local clubs from yugoslav leagues formed Slovenian Ice Hockey League. In the same year Slovenia national ice hockey team was formed, playing their first official match in Austria in 1992.\nNotable players.\nAnže Kopitar and Jan Muršak are the two slovenians to have played in the NHL.\nEuropean Leagues.\nRudi Hiti played for HC Alleghe"

Denmark, Gibraltar, Sweden and Wales made their FIFA Futsal World Cup qualifying debuts.\nFormat.\nThe qualifying competition consisted of three rounds:\nTiebreakers.\nIn the preliminary round and main round, the teams were ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss). If two or more teams were equal on points on completion of a mini-tournament, the following tie-breaking criteria were applied, in the order given, to determine the rankings:\nIn the play-offs, the team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs qualified for the final tournament. If the aggregate score was level, the away goals rule was applied, i.e., the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs advanced. If away goals were also equal, extra time was played. The away goals rule was again applied after extra time, i.e., if there were goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score was still level, the visiting team advanced by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals were scored during extra time, the tie was decided by penalty shoot-out.\nSchedule.\nThe qualifying matches were played on the following dates.\nEntrants.\nThe teams were ranked according to their coefficient ranking, calculated based on the following:\nThe 22 highest-ranked teams entered the main round, while the 23 lowest-ranked teams entered the preliminary round.

        "text": "Trump National Golf Club, Washington, D.C. is an private golf club in the eastern United States, at Lowes Island in Potomac Falls, Virginia, northwest of Washington, D.C.\nIt is part of the Trump chain of golf clubs that includes clubs in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Bedminster. The club contains two 18-hole golf courses, both par 72. The Championship Course was designed by Tom Fazio, and the Riverview course was added in 1999, when the club was still known as the Lowes Island Club. The Riverview Course abuts the Potomac River and was originally designed by Arthur Hills. The club also contains a clubhouse, an swimming pool, an indoor tennis center, and a fitness center.\nHistory.\nThe Trump National Golf Club (Washington, D.C.) was formerly the Lowes Island Club. Donald Trump purchased the club in 2009 for $13 million from a bank after the previous owner defaulted on its loans. He financed the purchase with a loan from Chevy Chase Bank. Trump then invested at least $25 million into the property. Trump hired Tom Fazio to remake the golf courses. The clubhouse, pool, and other facilities were also renovated. Renovations were completed in June 2015.\nAn estimated 465 trees were removed to provide unobstructed views of the Potomac River, prompting objections from some. The Trump Organization officials said that many of the trees were weak, in danger of becoming diseased, and presented soil erosion problems; the Loudoun County urban forester and other county officials \"did not oppose cutting down some unhealthy trees\" but did not feel \"that the extent of the removal was necessary\". A company official said that trash and debris was also removed from the riverbank.\nTrump had the \"River of Blood\" monument added near the Potomac River. The monument claims that \"Many great American soldiers, both of the North and South, died at this spot. The casualties were so great that the water would turn red.\" The plaque's claim is dubious, as a number of Civil War historians pointed out; no documented battle took place at or near the site.\nIn 2016, Trump's financial disclosures indicated the property earned $17.5 million in revenue. Eric Trump now manages the club. President Trump visited the club six times between mid-March and the end of May 2017.\nThe course hosted the Senior PGA Championship in May 2017; Bernhard Langer won his record ninth senior major title.\nTrump presidency.\nThis course became known during Donald Trump's presidency, because he golfed there on weekends when he was not traveling. He used the course throughout the year. Except when traveling to Mar-a-Lago or the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, he would golf at the club and would then travel to his hotel in Washington DC (the Old Post Office) for dinner."

The reigning champions entering the season were Saracens, who had claimed their second title after defeating Bath in the 2015 final. Worcester Warriors had been promoted as champions from the 2014–15 RFU Championship at the first attempt.\nThe competition was broadcast by BT Sport for the third successive season. Highlights of each weekend's games were shown on ITV4.\nSummary.\nSaracens won their third title after defeating Exeter Chiefs in the final at Twickenham having also topped the regular season table. London Irish were relegated after being unable to win their penultimate game of the season. It was the second time that London Irish have been relegated from the top flight since the leagues began and the first time since the 1993–94 Premiership Rugby season.\nThe competition began slightly later than normal, due to the 2015 Rugby World Cup taking place in England and in a slight change to usual, the London Double Header at Twickenham, the twelfth instance since its inception in 2004, was played in round 5 instead of round 1.\nRule changes.\nThis season was the first of several significant changes to the Premiership's salary cap regulations:\nIn addition to the above, a standard cap provision applicable only in Rugby World Cup years, gave each club a £35,000 cap credit (up from £30,000 in the last World Cup season of 2011–12) for each member of the senior squad who participated in the tournament.\nTeams.\nTwelve teams compete in the league – the top eleven teams from the previous season and Worcester Warriors who were promoted from the 2014–15 RFU Championship after a top flight absence of one year. They replaced London Welsh who were relegated after one year in the top flight.\nPre-season.\nThe 2015 edition of the Singha Premiership Rugby Sevens was held in August. Once again, the four Welsh Regions contested a group, alongside the twelve Premiership clubs, which were split into three groups. The top two sides from each group contested the series final at the Twickenham Stoop on 28 August. The series was won by Welsh region Newport Gwent Dragons who beat Premiership side Wasps in the final.\nRegular season.\nFixtures for the season were announced by Premiership Rugby at 11am on 3 July 2015. Unlike previous seasons, the London Double Header would not take place in round 1 because Twickenham Stadium was being used for the 2015 Rugby World Cup, but would instead take place during round 5, on 28 November 2015.\nOne game during this season was played on foreign soil, in the United States. The London Irish v Saracens match – played in Round 16 on 12 March 2016 – took place at the Red Bull Arena in Harrison, New Jersey.\nRound 9 rescheduled match.\nThis match – originally scheduled to be held during Round 9, on 8 January 2016 – was postponed due to a European Rugby Champions Cup fixture rearrangement that occurred as a result of the Paris terrorist attacks in November 2015. It was further rescheduled from 13 April 2016, after Sale Sharks were eliminated from the European Rugby Challenge Cup.\nPlay-offs.\nAs in previous seasons, the top four teams in the Premiership table, following the conclusion of the regular season, contest the play-off semi-finals in a 1st vs 4th and 2nd vs 3rd format, with the higher ranking team having home advantage. The two winners of the semi-finals then meet in the Premiership Final at Twickenham on 28 May 2016.\nLeading scorers.\nNote: Flags indicate national union as has been defined under WR eligibility rules.

Similar regulations in the singles tournaments also apply to the players competing in the doubles, as the NOCs could only enter a maximum of two pairs if both are ranked in the top eight, while the remaining NOCs are entitled to one until the quota of 16 highest-ranked pairs is filled.\nQualifying standards.\nQualification of these Games will be based on the BWF Ranking list to be published on May 5, 2016, providing a total of 16 pairs in each doubles event, and 38 players in each singles event in the following criteria:\nEach of the five continental confederations will be guaranteed at least one entry in each singles and doubles event (this is called the Continental Representation Place system). If this has not been satisfied by the entry selection method described above, the highest ranked player or pair from the respective continent will qualify. A NOC can qualify players or pairs in a maximum of two events through the Continental Representation Place system; if a NOC qualifies for more than two events through the Continental Representation Place system, the NOC must choose which of them are qualified, and the quota place declined will be offered to the next NOC's eligible player or pair. For each player who qualifies in more than one discipline, an unused quota place will be allocated to the next best ranked eligible athlete of a respective gender in the singles events on the BWF Ranking List as of May 5, 2016.\nHost nation Brazil has been entitled to enter a male and a female badminton player in each of the singles tournaments, but more than two players may be permitted if they have achieved the qualifying regulations. Meanwhile, six quota places are made available to eligible NOCs through the Tripartite Commission Invitation, with three each in the men's and women's singles.\nQualified players.\nThe color pink signifies that a player has been withdrawn from the competition."

        "text": "Headingley Rugby Stadium (known as AMT Headingley Rugby Stadium due to sponsorship) is a Rugby League stadium in Headingley, Leeds and shares the same site as Headingley Cricket Ground. It is the home ground of the Leeds Rhinos. Headingley is the 5th largest rugby league stadium in England.\nHistory.\n1889-1980s: Construction and development.\nLeeds St Johns, who were later to become Leeds Rugby League Football Club then Leeds Rhinos, moved to Headingley in 1889 and built Headingley stadium. Leeds were founder members of the Northern Union in 1895 and Headingley hosted rugby league's first ever Challenge Cup Final in 1897.\nIn the 1930s, major developments took place on two sides of the rugby ground. The South Stand was completed in 1931, with some of the work being carried out by club players, while the old wooden North Stand was burned down during a match against Halifax on 25 March 1932. By the end of 1932, a new North Stand had been completed. The record attendance at Headingley was 40,175 for the rugby league match between Leeds and Bradford Northern on 21 May 1947. Undersoil heating was installed in 1963 but has since been removed due to ongoing problems, and floodlights were installed in 1966. The 1970 Rugby League World Cup final between Great Britain and Australia was played at the stadium before a crowd of 18,776.\nThe third and deciding Test of the 1978 Ashes series was played at Headingley before a crowd of 30,604.\n1990s–2000: Rugby union and World Cup games.\nNew changing rooms were added in 1991, the same year Leeds RUFC were founded and moved into Headingley. In July 1998, Leeds RUFC came under common ownership with Leeds Rhinos, the two becoming part of the world's first dual-code rugby partnership, Leeds Rugby Limited.\nHeadingley only hosted one match of the 1995 Rugby League World Cup, held in England and Wales to celebrate the centenary of rugby league in England. Host nation England defeated rugby league minnows South Africa 46–0 in front of 14,041 fans.\nTwo matches of the 2000 Rugby League World Cup were held at Headingley which included England v. Fiji which England won by 66–10 in front of a crowd of 10,052 and latterly the quarter-final fixture between England and Ireland which England won by 26–16 and attracted 15,405 spectators.\n2001–2006: East Stand expansion and redevelopment.\nIn 2001 capacity was increased marginally by extending the terracing around the corner in between the Western Terraces and the North Stand.\nSince 2005 Headingley rugby stadium has been the venue for the annual varsity rugby union match between Leeds Beckett University and the University of Leeds which has attracted over 11,000 spectators.\n2005 also saw the construction of the Carnegie Stand, built to replace the Eastern Terrace. The new stand had two tiers with 1,844 seats and hospitality suites. It was opened on 1 September 2006 for the Super League match between Leeds Rhinos and Warrington Wolves.\n2012–2015: More international games.\nThe 2012 World Club Challenge saw the stadium packed to its capacity when the home team, and Super League XVI Champions, Leeds Rhinos took on the 2011 NRL winners the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. 21,062 turned out to see the Rhinos defeat Manly 26–12, the game being highlighted by Ryan Hall's 90 metre intercept try midway through the first half. This saw Leeds gain some revenge for their 28–20 loss to Manly in the 2009 World Club Challenge at Elland Road.\nThe stadium hosted two matches of the 2013 Rugby League World Cup: a Group B game featuring New Zealand, the defending World Cup Champions, and Papua New Guinea on Friday 8 November which the Kiwis won 56–10 in front of an audience of 18,180. Headingley also hosted a Quarter-final game on Friday 15 November between New Zealand and Scotland which New Zealand won by 40–4 to a crowd of 16,207.\nIn 2015 Headingley hosted New Zealand again for the first time since 2013 where they took on Leeds Rhinos as a warm up for their test series against England. It also marked 120 years of rugby league being played at the stadium.\n2016–2019: Major redevelopment.\nIn January 2016, it was announced that the North and South stands were to be rebuilt as part of the overdue redevelopment of the stadium and adjoining cricket ground. Parts of the South Stand were condemned in 2011 and the club wanted to modernise the rest of the ground after the Carnegie Stand was completed in 2006. Financing for the £44 million redevelopment works on both the rugby stadium and cricket ground was secured from insurance and investment management group Legal &amp; General in March 2017, with a further £10 million as well as a stadium sponsorship secured in June 2017 from Emerald Group Publishing.\nThe South Stand was demolished towards the end of the 2017 season with the North Stand following at the end of the season. Leeds Rhinos mostly continued playing at Headingley while construction work was underway on both stands, although two games were moved to Elland Road at the start of the 2018 season.\nThe new South Stand, housing up to 7,700 standing and seated supporters was officially opened in January 2019, while the North Stand, housing up to 3,800 seated supporters, opened in May 2019.\n2020–present.\nFollowing the loosening of COVID-19 restrictions in July 2020, Headingley was chosen alongside the Totally Wicked Stadium as the host of multiple rounds of Super League XXV, which were held behind closed doors following the restart of the Super League season on August 2.\nThe stadium also hosted the 2022 Championship Summer Bash. The total attendance over the weekend at the stadium was recorded at 10,763, the lowest seen for a Summer Bash, with 4,011 recorded as attending the matches held on Sunday.\nFuture.\nThe rebuilding of the North and South Stands in 2018 future proofed the stadium. The only part of the ground that remains untouched is the Western Terrace. The club have explored possibilities of expanding the stand and putting a roof over it however due the there being a public right of way and residential houses plans have never been able to come to fruition.\nLayout.\nNorth Stand.\nCapacity- 3,825 (seated)\nThe North Stand backs onto the cricket stadium. The stand also houses the changing rooms as well as the media and journalists and a banqueting suite that is shared by both the cricket and rugby grounds.\nGlobal East Stand.\nCapacity- 4,550 (1,844 seated)\nThe Global East Stand was completed in 2006 and replaced the Eastern Terrace. The stand has two tiers; the bottom contained terracing whilst the top contains seating, hospitality boxes, bars and a restaurant. It was originally known as the Carnegie Stand but was renamed Extentia Stand in late 2018.\nSouth Stand.\nCapacity- 7,721 (2,217 seated)\nThe South Stand is well known in rugby league for being the ground's popular side. The original stand was open to the elements but, following rebuilding in the 1930s, it was partially enclosed by a pitched roof. The roof was extended to cover the entire stand in the 1960s. \nThe stand was rebuilt in 2018 and contains two tiers, the bottom tier is terracing and the upper tier is seating. The stand also contains the TV gantry.\nBefore the replacement of the original roofs in 1999, the front of the South Stand featured a narrow spiral staircase, in full view of all spectators, via which television commentators accessed the television gantry on the roof. Rugby League commentator Eddie Waring claimed that, to brave the taunts and insults from fans as he climbed the stairs, he would sing the hymn, \"Fight the Good Fight\" to himself until reaching the sanctuary of the commentary box.\nWestern Terrace.\nCapacity- 3,604\nThe Western Terrace is the only part of the stadium not covered and houses the away fans. It is the only part of the ground that has had no major redevelopment nor are there any plans to do so as there is a public right of way and housing behind it. The biggest change to the Western Terrace is the permanent video board in the South West corner which replaced the temporary one in the North West corner.\nSponsors.\nHeadingley first sold naming rights in 1990 to brewers Bass following which the stadium's official name became Bass Headingley. Following the end of this arrangement the ground did not have another naming rights sponsor until 2006 when Leeds Metropolitan University took the rights during the construction of the Carnegie Stand.\nIn 2017, Headingley sold the naming rights to Bingley-based publishers Emerald Group during the redevelopment of the North and South stands. Emerald withdrew their sponsorship from the full Headingley complex in November 2021, after which the rugby stadium reverted to its original name of Headingley Stadium.\nAt the end of the 2023 season, Leeds announced a record breaking 15 year sponsorship deal with Leeds based car leasing company AMT.\nOther uses.\nRugby League Internationals.\nWorld Cup matches.\nHeadingley has hosted 12 World Cup games since England first hosted the tournament in 1960. The stadium will host three more games during the postponed 2021 World Cup.\nTest matches.\nList of rugby league test matches played at Headingley.\nTour Matches.\nOther than Leeds club games, Headingley has also seen Leeds, the county team Yorkshire and a Northern Union XIII (sometimes called English League) side play host to various international touring teams from 1911–2015.\nWorld Club Challenge.\nHeadingley has hosted five games of the World Club Challenge / Championship / Series between 1997–2016.\nRugby League Finals.\nFirst Division finals.\nThe ground has hosted six of the old First Division Finals. The first being in 1914 when Salford beat Huddersfield and the last in 1968 when Wakefield beat Hull KR.\nSince Super League inception in 1996, Old Trafford has hosted all but one Grand Final.\nSecond Division finals.\nHeadingley hosted its first Championship Grand Final in 2007 when Castleford beat Widnes in front of 20,000 people to be promoted to Super League. The event returned in 2014 when Leigh beat Featherstone however they were not promoted due to Super League then licensing period.\nThird Division finals.\nAs part of the Championship Finals that included the Championship Grand Final, Headingley hosted the Championship 1 Grand Finals\nChallenge Cup Semi-finals.\nHeadingley has hosted 13 Challenge Cup semi finals and one replay since 1981. The last semi final to be held at Headingley was in 2015 when Hull KR beat Warrington. In recent years the semi-finals have been held at one neutral venue as a double header."

Instead of using the Télégraphe, the riders would continue along the valley to Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne rather than Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne, where they would start the long \"Hors catégorie\" Col de la Croix de Fer. The climb was used for the second day in a row, although a different side was used. This one is less steep, averaging 5.2%. From there, the peloton used the route of stage 18's ascent as a descent towards Le Bourg-d'Oisans, where the planned intermediate sprint was held, before the Alpe d'Huez, also as scheduled. The distance of the stage remained intact.\nStage 21.\nThe final stage departed from Sèvres heading west, with racing officially starting on the at Ville-d'Avray, before doubling back to take the , back through Sèvres. The riders then headed south-east, going over the category 4 \"Côte de l'Observatoire\", through Meudon and east to Issy-les-Moulineaux. The race then took a circuitous turn west to cross the Seine at the , over the northern point of Île Saint-Germain. The race crossed into Boulogne-Billancourt and followed the Rive Droite to the Longchamp Racecourse, where the riders passed around the northern side, before crossing the Bois de Boulogne to the Palais des congrès de Paris. The race headed up the Avenue de la Grande Armée, to reach the Arc de Triomphe, and then headed down \"Avenue Marceau\", back towards the Seine. The peloton turned right onto the \"Avenue de New York\", then turned left and crossed the Seine at the Pont d'Iéna. After crossing the bridge, the riders turned left again, in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, along \"Quai Branly\" and turned onto \"Avenue Bosquet\". This was followed by the \"Avenue de Tourville\" and the \"Boulevard des Invalides\". The race then crossed through the gardens of Les Invalides reaching the \"Quai d'Orsay\" and turning right. On reaching the Pont du Carrousel, the race crossed the Seine for the final time.\nThe race passed the Louvre and turned left to travel along the Rue de Rivoli, through the Place de la Concorde and onto the Champs-Élysées. The race then began ten circuits around central Paris, heading up the Champs-Élysées and, as has been the case since 2013, around the Arc de Triomphe on the Place de l'Étoile. The riders returned down the opposite side of the Champs-Élysées, and around the Jardin des Tuileries. Finally, back along the Rue de Rivoli, and through the Place de la Concorde, to the finish line on the Champs-Élysées.\nBecause of poor weather conditions in Paris before the start of the stage (and during the La Course women's race), the race organizers decided that all general classification times would stop upon the first crossing of the line on the Champs-Élysées, which meant that Chris Froome's victory was secured. The riders would still have to complete all 10 laps of the circuit to complete the full race distance."

The team played the world's first inter-district match that year against Edinburgh District rugby union team.\nThe amateur Glasgow District side evolved into the professional Glasgow Warriors side in 1996; one year after rugby union allowed professionalism in 1995.\nFormation.\nThe Glasgow District side was formed in 1872 to play against an Edinburgh District side.\nThe teams met on 23 November 1872 at Burnbank Park at Woodlands in Glasgow; and Edinburgh District won 1 drop goal – 0 in a 20-a-side fixture. This is the oldest inter-district match in the world and to mark this the current Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh Rugby sides play for the 1872 Cup every year.\nThe first Glasgow team in 1872:-\n Thomas Chalmers (Glasgow Academicals), William Davie Brown (Glasgow Academicals),William Hamilton Kidston (West of Scotland)\n William Cross (Glasgow Academicals), T. A. Drew (Glasgow Academicals)\n George Buchanan McClure (West of Scotland), John Arthur (Glasgow Academicals) [Captain]\n John Kennedy Tod, Henry William Allan, Charles Chalmers Bryce, George Raphael Fleming,J.S. Thomson, J.K. Brown (all Glasgow Academicals)\nJames Howe McClure, J. Kennedy, J.P. Tennant, Robert Wilson, G. Hunter, A. Cochrane (all West of Scotland)\nJ.W. Reid (Glasgow University)\nAfter the initial match at Burnbank, the games rotated - in the twice a season format - between Raeburn Place in Edinburgh and Hamilton Crescent in Partick, Glasgow.\nSelection of representative players.\nOften to aid the selection process of Glasgow District's players a trial match was played.\nIn Glasgow's case a trial match of hopefuls were divided into Blues and Whites teams, so the players could impress the selectors.\nGlasgow also played a 'Rest of the West' team for selection.\nEarly history.\nThe Inter-City.\nWith the exception of the first four years, the Glasgow v Edinburgh district fixture was more or less played annually; only being beaten by World War and occasional inclement weather.\nTypically the Glasgow District side, in its early history, was crammed with Scottish international players.\nThe Glasgow team for the 5 December 1874 match is an example:\n William Davie Brown [captain] ᵜ , James Stewart Carrick ᵜ (both Glasgow Academicals)\n Malcolm Cross ᵜ (Glasgow Academicals), William Hamilton Kidston ᵜ (West of Scotland)\n James Howe McClure ᵜ , George Buchanan McClure ᵜ (both West of Scotland), John Kennedy Tod ᵜ (Glasgow Academicals)\n Gilbert Heron ᵜ, Charles Chalmers Bryce ᵜ , Allan Arthur ᵜ , Henry William Allan ᵜ , George Raphael Fleming ᵜ (all Glasgow Academicals)\nTom Paterson Neilson ᵜ , John Alexander Neilson ᵜ , J.S. Kennedy, Preston (West of Scotland)\nC.E. McArthur, Henry Melville Napier ᵜ , W.B. Russell, J. Hutchison (Glasgow University)\n\"ᵜ Marked as Scottish internationalists.\"\nThe first 15-a-side match was played on 29 January 1876.\nFrom the Inter-City formation in 1872, Edinburgh won the first two fixtures. Six draws followed, then came sporadic Edinburgh wins and draws. It was not until the 13th inter-city tie that Glasgow won the fixture.\nThe first winning Glasgow side in 1881:\nDavid Kidston (G. Academicals), A. J. W. Reid and C. W. Dunlop (West of Scotland),John Alexander Neilson (West of Scotland) and C. Ker (G. Academicals),D. Y. Cassels [captain], D. McGowan, A. Walker, R. Adam (West of Scotland), R. B. Young, J. Lang (Glasgow University),John Blair Brown, R. A. Kerr, William Andrew Walls, G. H. Robb (G. Academicals).\nGlasgow then held dominance until 1887 when once more Edinburgh won again. From the 1880s to the close of the 1890s Edinburgh won a total of only four times in 20-years. The tide turned back in Edinburgh's favour in 1898. With only a solitary Glasgow win in 1905, Edinburgh held sway until 1914.\nHamilton Crescent, New Anniesland, Old Anniesland.\nThe games were postponed during the First World War period. After around 50-years at Hamilton Crescent – the West of Scotland ground in Woodlands, Glasgow – the Glasgow v Edinburgh fixture moved to Glasgow Academical's ground at New Anniesland, Glasgow, in 1921. This move prompted yet another shift in balance as Glasgow once again became the dominant force of the two districts. The fixture moved to Glasgow HSFP's ground Old Anniesland in 1927.\nRugby Union.\nTo coincide with the Scottish Football Union changing its name to the Scottish Rugby Union in 1924, the SRU made the Glasgow District Union into the Glasgow District Rugby Union that same year.\nTouring sides.\nGlasgow often played matches against international and non-international touring teams. Occasionally both Glasgow and Edinburgh would field joint teams against the international touring teams.\nOne strange example is that of the New South Wales Waratahs world tour in 1927–28. They played against Glasgow District on 12 October 1927. Due to collapse of the Queensland Rugby Union they effectively were a de facto Australian national rugby team at the time and the Australian Rugby Union have decreed that their international matches of that tour should be taken as full tests. In the match against Glasgow, the Waratahs won 10–0.\nScottish Inter-District Championship.\nTwo other Scottish districts South and North and Midlands had also been formed and there was regular matches between the four Scottish districts as well as against the touring sides.\nThe Scottish Inter-District Championship was established in the 1953–54 season. The Glasgow, Edinburgh, South and North and Midlands sides would play off to see which district was best in Scotland. From 1981 an Anglo-Scots or Scottish Exiles team was also invited into this championship.\nFamously the 1989 Glasgow District side went through the entire 1989–90 season undefeated:- winning the Scottish Inter-District Championship outright; drawing 18–18 with Munster away; winning 21–6 against Connacht away; and winning against Fiji\nGlasgow Inter-District Championship-winning squad 1989–1990.\nGraeme Smillie (Glasgow Academicals)\nDave Barrett, Matt Duncan, Dave McKee (West of Scotland), Ian Jardine, George Graham, Kevin McKenzie, Brian Robertson, Stewart Hamilton (all Stirling County), Derek Stark, Phil Manning, David McVey (Ayr), George Breckenridge, Ewan McCorkindale, Alan Watt, Shade Munro, Fergus Wallace, Derek Busby (all Glasgow High Kelvinside), Stewart McAslan (Glasgow Academicals), David Jackson (Hillhead Jordanhill).\nAge grades.\nThe Scottish Inter-District Championship was also contested at Age Grade level. The Under 21 Glasgow District side won for the first time in 1986–87 season. With players like Shade Munro, Andrew Garry, Gordon Mackay, Gerry Hawkes and Murray Wallace in that side, it gave a good foundation for the 1989–90 season triumph and these young players later went on to represent the fledgling professional Glasgow side.\nEffect of professionalism.\nWith the advent of professionalism in 1995, the Scottish Rugby Union realised that not even the best semi-professional Scottish club teams could compete in the new Professional Era in rugby union, which was beginning to gain great momentum in the professional leagues of the Southern Hemisphere and the Northern Hemisphere.\nIn an attempt to stay in touch with the leading nations the SRU formed four professional teams out of the four amateur districts of Scotland in 1996. It was these newly professional teams that would represent Scotland in the Heineken Cup and in the Celtic League. The amateur Glasgow District side was to become the professional Glasgow Warriors side.\nFor the subsequent history of the professional Glasgow rugby district team from 1996, see Glasgow Warriors.\nRebirth of the amateur district.\nGlasgow District, or Glasgow and the West, as an amateur district, will return in the 2022–23 Amateur Scottish Inter-District Championship. Its Head Coach will be Kenny Diffenthal of Marr Rugby, aided by assistant coaches Thomas Davidson (Glasgow Hawks) and Stephen Adair (Marr).\nDiffenthal noted:\nIt is indeed a great honour and privilege to be selected as Head Coach of Glasgow and the West. Looking ahead, it’s going to be a tough competition, entering the unknown mixing clubs and coaches, but it is an exciting challenge and a great opportunity to bring together talented players from across the District. I have a great team with Thomas and Stephen assisting me and we are looking forward to working closely together to build a strong squad.\nRecords and achievements.\nHonours.\nThe Glasgow District won the Scottish Inter-District Championship outright in 1955–56, 1973–74 and 1989–90.\nIt also shared the Scottish Inter-District Championship six times: 1964–65, 1967–68, 1972–73, 1974–75, 1975–76 and 1977–78.\nSeason standings.\nInter-City.\nGlasgow score given first. ᵜ Previous to 1876 only goals counted; tries were ignored in the result.\nScoreline key:\nTwice a season matches.\n1st 1872 - 73 match played at Burnbank Park in Woodlands, Glasgow;2nd 1872 - 73 match played at Raeburn Place in Stockbridge, Edinburgh\n1st 1873 - 74 match played at Raeburn Place. 2nd 1873 - 74 match played at Hamilton Crescent in Partick, Glasgow.\n1st 1874 - 75 match played at Hamilton Crescent; 2nd 1874 - 75 match played at Raeburn Place.\n1st 1875 - 76 match played at Hamilton Crescent; 2nd 1875 - 76 match played at Raeburn Place.\nAnnual matches.\n * 1885 match played at the 2nd Hampden Park - the modern Hampden Park is the 3rd park with that name. The 2nd Hampden Park was renamed as New Cathkin Park and taken over by Third Lanark.\nScottish Inter-District Championship.\nThe Inter-City match was then incorporated into the Scottish Inter-District Championship. For Glasgow's professional championship results from 1996 see Glasgow Warriors; for results of later Glasgow - Edinburgh matches see 1872 Cup.\nProfessional Era.\nThe Amateur Scottish Inter-District Championship has been restarted twice in the professional era. The first restart was from 1999 to 2002; the second restart from the 2022-23 season.\nNotable former players.\nBritish and Irish Lions from Glasgow District.\nThe following former Glasgow District players have represented the British and Irish Lions.\nNotable non-Scottish players.\nThe following is a list of notable non-Scottish international representative former Glasgow players:"

        "title": "Jamie Clarke (snooker player)",
        "text": "Jamie Clarke (born 5 October 1994) is a Welsh professional snooker player.\nCareer.\nClarke drew attention in 2014 when he defeated former world number 8 Darren Morgan in 6–0 whitewash in the semi-finals of the Welsh Amateur Championship before going on to defeat Lee Walker to capture the highest ranking and most prestigious amateur event in Wales. In 2015 Clarke entered several events in an attempt to qualify for the World Snooker Tour and narrowly missed out by losing in the final of tournaments on 3 occasions. In April, Clarke lost 3–4 in a final-frame decider to Martin O'Donnell in the final round of the EBSA Qualifying Tour Play-off. Clarke would go on to enter Q School in May 2015, but would be unable to advance further than the third round. In June 2015, Clarke qualified for the knockout stage of EBSA European Snooker Championship as the 19th seed where he lost 4–7 to Michael Wild in the final.\nThe following month at the IBSF World Under-21 Snooker Championship Clarke once again reached the tournament final before losing 7–8 in the deciding frame to Boonyarit Keattikun. In February 2016, Clarke once again reached the final of the EBSA European Snooker Championship as the number 1 seed, however he was once again defeated 4–7 losing to fellow countryman Jak Jones. Two months later Clarke again lost a final-frame decider 3–4 to Elliot Slessor in the final round of the EBSA Qualifying Tour Play-off. This was Clarke's fifth defeat in the final round of a tournament to qualify for the World Snooker Tour. Clarke was finally able to gain professional status at the sixth attempt, in the EBSA Tour Qualifying Play-offs, thanks to victories over former World Championship semi-finalist Andy Hicks and English amateur George Pragnall.\nHe qualified for the first time for the 2020 World Snooker Championship, defeating Mark Allen 10–8 in the first round despite Allen scoring 5 centuries. Clarke was involved in a controversial incident during his second round match against Anthony McGill. Clarke was leading 7–2 when McGill complained to him directly that he had stood in his eyeline on several occasions during the match while he was getting down on a shot. Referee Jan Verhaas intervened but it seemed to unsettle Clarke after he won the frame. During the interval he tweeted 'You want to dance, let's dance.' McGill won the remaining five frames of the session to trail 7–8. Ultimately the match went to a decider; Clarke was in first during the deciding frame before failing to escape from a snooker, and leaving a free ball. This was enough for McGill to win the match and see Clarke lose 12–13.\nClarke's campaign at the 2021 World Snooker Championship ended in a similar fashion. In the last qualifying round, he led Mark Davis 7-2 after the first session before Davis won seven frames on a spin in the second session, with Clarke eventually losing 8–10."

        "title": "Jerry Norman (basketball)",
        "text": "Jerry Norman (born ) is an American former college basketball player and coach. He was an assistant coach under John Wooden with the UCLA Bruins for 11 seasons, helping Wooden earn the first four of his record 10 national titles. He is enshrined in the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame.\nNorman played basketball at UCLA and was co-captain during his senior year, when he was named first-team all-conference in the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC). After serving in the United States Navy and coaching in high school, he rejoined Wooden at UCLA as an assistant coach. He was a top recruiter for the Bruins, helping the program expand its recruiting radius from local to nationwide. Norman also introduced a pressuring zone press defense to UCLA, which was instrumental to their first two national championships. He retired from coaching in 1968 in order to enter the much more lucrative financial industry.\nEarly life.\nNorman attended Horace Mann Jr. High and Washington High in Los Angeles. After graduating high school in 1947, he enrolled at East Los Angeles College, where he led the Metropolitan Conference in scoring and was named first-team All-Southern California Junior College. He received some athletic scholarship offers from Division I schools, and accepted UCLA's offer at the urging of Eddie Sheldrake, his best friend and a former Washington High teammate who was playing at UCLA.\nCollege career.\nIn Norman's sophomore year in 1949–50, UCLA qualified for the NCAA tournament, the first in Coach John Wooden's career. The following season, Norman was kicked off the team for two weeks after talking to a teammate during practice and not paying attention to Wooden. Sheldrake, who was also friendly with Wooden, convinced the two to reconcile. In 1951–52, Norman was co-captain of the team with fellow senior Don Johnson, and the Bruins won the PCC title and qualified for the 1952 NCAA tournament. Norman and Johnson were unanimously selected first-team All-PCC.\nProfessional career.\nAfter graduating in 1952, Norman served years in the Navy before teaching and coaching for a year at West Covina High, where Wooden's brother was the principal. In the fall of 1957, Norman returned to UCLA after accepting a teaching position in the physical education department. \n Wooden asked him to moonlight as the coach of the freshman basketball team, and Norman compiled a 94–22 record in six seasons while successfully employing a zone press. In July 1959, Norman became a varsity assistant.\nAccording to sportswriter Seth Davis, author of \"Wooden: A Coach’s Life\", Norman is deserving of more credit for Wooden's success than people generally attribute to him. Wooden began coaching UCLA in 1948–49, but the Bruins never advanced past the first round of the NCAA tournament until after Norman was hired. During the 1963–64 season, Norman convinced a reluctant Wooden to use the zone press, which the team had never utilized before. The Bruins had employed a man-to-man press with some success in 1962–63, but it had been ineffective in their opening-game of the NCAA tournament—a 93–79 blowout loss to Arizona State. Norman instead proposed a 2–2–1 full-court zone press, which quickened the pace of the game and was influential in the first two national titles won by the Bruins, who were undersized.\nNorman was also UCLA's top recruiter, which complemented Wooden's aversion to recruiting. He recruited 15 players who were later inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame, including two players enshrined in the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame: Lew Alcindor (now known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) and Gail Goodrich. After becoming Wooden's top assistant, Norman encouraged UCLA athletic director J. D. Morgan to expand the recruiting budget and extend their recruiting from California to nationwide. Previously, Wooden had a limited budget and was satisfied with landing players locally. Under Norman, UCLA's recruits included Alcindor from New York, Walt Hazzard from Philadelphia, and Lucius Allen from Kansas.\nPrior to the 1967–68 season, Norman contemplated quitting. He had grown weary of the workload and stress, and lamented his pay. His $14,000 salary was not sufficient to support his wife and children. Wooden himself was making only $17,000, less than contemporaries such as Dean Smith, who was estimated to have been making $85,000 at the time. Norman had been working part-time in the financial industry with friends, and was primed to transition full-time. Morgan convinced him to stay, but Norman warned that it would likely be his last season. UCLA claimed their fourth national title in five seasons. In a rout of Houston in the semifinals of the NCAA tournament, Wooden credited Norman for devising the diamond-and-one defense that the Bruins used to contain Elvin Hayes, who was averaging 37.7 points per game but was held to only 10. The win avenged an upset loss to the Cougars in The Game of the Century earlier in the season. Wooden's four titles, each with Norman as his assistant, matched the then-record held by Kentucky coach Adolph Rupp.\nMorgan promised Norman that if he stayed, he would become the Bruins' head coach once Wooden retired, which ended up being seven years later. “If he’d paid Coach [Wooden] $100,000 like he deserved, and if I had gotten $50,000 I would have stayed,” Norman said. According to Morgan, Wooden never asked for a raise. In his final year in 1975, Wooden's salary maxed out at $32,000, and he finished his career with a record 10 national titles. Upon leaving UCLA in 1968 after 11 seasons with the team, Norman became a stockbroker, earning $60,000 in his first year. He enjoyed a successful business career and became a multi-millionaire.\nIn 1986, Norman was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame.\nPersonal life.\nNorman and his wife, June, were married for 63 years. She died in 2014. Together, they had three children and four grandchildren."

        "text": "The 2015 Women's U25 Wheelchair Basketball World Championship was held at the China Disability Sports Training Centre in Beijing from 30 June to 6 July 2015. Six nations competed: Australia, Canada, China, Germany, Great Britain and Japan. The event took the form of a Round-robin tournament, with each team playing all the other teams once. The top four teams then went into semi-finals, while the bottom two played each other for world ranking. The winners of the semi-finals faced each other in the final, while the losers played for bronze. The championship was won by Team Great Britain. Australia came second and China third.\nCompetition.\nThis was the second time the Women's U25 Wheelchair Basketball World Championship was held. The first time was the 2011 Women's U25 Wheelchair Basketball World Championship in St. Catharines, Canada, in 2011. The Championship was hosted by the China Administration of Sports for Persons with Disabilities (CASPD) and the National Paralympic Committee of China.\nAustralia's Don Perriman was designated the Chief Classifier. Other classifiers were Canada's Anne Lachance, Germany's Sabine Drisch and Lithuania's Vaidas Stravinskas. Japan's Taichi Nishimura and the Netherlands' Nathalie Van Meurs were the Game Commissioners. Referee supervisors were Australia's Matthew Wells and Spain's Tonia Gomez. Referees were Helen Rosenberg from Australia, Robert Ruisinger from Germany, Jun Zhang from China, Hrvoje Pencinger from Croatia, Linas Radykas from Lithuania, Shu Fei Hsieh from Chinese Taipei and Celine Villard from France.\nVenue.\nThe competition was held at the China Disability Sports Training Centre in Beijing. This is a purpose-built centre for disability sports. Opened on 28 June 2007, it was the first facility in China entirely devoted to disability sports training, and is the largest of its kind in the world. The Chinese Paralympic team used it as its training and preparation centre for the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing. The entire complex is wheelchair accessible, with large elevators and wide halls.\nTeams.\nSix nations competed: Australia, Canada, China, Germany, Great Britain and Japan. Australia had won silver and Great Britain bronze in St. Catharines. This was the first time that the host country was competing.\nHead Coach: David Gould Assistant Coach: Tom KyleTechnical Assistant: Michael OxleyDevelopment Coach: Ben HodgensTeam Manager: Trudy VineyPhysiotherapist: Natasha MelacrinisProgram Manager: Leigh Gooding\n\nHead coach: Ross NortonAssistant coach: Simon CashManager: Andrea MuirPhysio: Teresa Budwal\nHead coach: Nora SchratzTeam manager: Yvone Daniel-SchratzDoctor: Petra Michel-LeuteueserPhysiotherapist: Franziska VogelTechnics: Thomas Grumpert\n\nTeam manager: Lauren SmithHead coach: Thompson MilesAssistant coach: Matthew FodenPhysiotherapist: Alison NagataMechanic: Jonathan MorriPerformance Director: Paul DaviesPerformance Analyst: Ian Britton\nHead coach: Yuan Sheng XuAssistant coach: Yan HanManager:Qi ChenPhysio: Yi Chuan Zhang\n\nTean Leader: Osamu KotakiHead coach: Kyoko TsukamotoAssistant coach: Akiko NagahamaTeam Staff: Eriko YokosePhysiotherapist: Kayoko Hashimoto\nPreliminary round.\nThe event took the form of a Round-robin tournament, with each team playing all the other teams once. The top four teams then went into semi-finals, while the bottom two played each other for ranking. The winners of the semi-finals faced each other in the final, while the losers played for bronze.\nDay 1.\nThere were three matches each day. The first was between the Australian team, known as the Devils, and Japan. The Japanese team found themselves outclassed, with Australia outscoring them in the first quarter by 26–6. Australia's Amber Merritt was particularly dangerous, finishing the day with 22 points from 16 field goal attempts. Australia continued in the same vein in the second quarter, outscoring Japan 14–7. The second half proved more even, but only because Australian coach David Gould benched his top players; the final siren saw Australia winning 50–26.\nThe second game, between Great Britain and Canada, saw the former confirm its status as a contender for the gold medal, winning the first three quarters by 14–7, 15–4 and 15–4. The scoreline did not tell the whole story, however, for Canada's defensive pressure exacted a relatively low return for Great Britain's efforts, with only 24 field goals being scored from 60 attempts. Canada fared even more poorly though, with only 14 from 49 attempts. Britain's Jordanna Bartlett racked up 12 points, followed by Laurie Williams and Amy Conroy with 10 each. Canada's highest scorer was Arinn Young, with 11 points.\nThe final game of the day, held after the Opening Ceremony, saw host nation China facing Germany. The German team, spearheaded by Annabel Breuer and Laura Fürst, got off to a two-point lead at the first break, but the Chinese team outscored them in the two subsequent quarters by 18-4and 17–10. Tian Jiao Lei led China's scoring with 18 points, followed by Xue Jing Chen with 13. Laura Fürst contributed 14 points to Germany's scoreline, followed by Linda Dahle with 10. Despite a late rally by Germany, the Chinese team went away victors, 59–45.\nDay 2.\nThe first game of the second day saw Australia and Great Britain, two of the previous day's winners face each other. Dominating the play were two tall players, both veterans of the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London: Australia's Amber Merritt, who racked up 28 points from 10 field goals and eight free throws, and Great Britain's Amy Conroy with 21 points from 10 fields goals and one of her five free throw attempts. After trailing for the first half, Australia outscored Great Britain in the third quarter 20–9 to lead by three points at three-quarter time. In the final quarter though, Great Britain stormed back to win by nine points.\nThe second game was between two of the first day's losing sides, Germany and Japan. A gallant Japanese side that never gave up provided Germany a contest, but Germany led at every break, and came away 50–28 winners. Barbara Groß racked up 22 points, followed by Linda Dahle with 11, while Japan's Mayo Hagino scored 18.\nIn the third game, Canada raced to a 22–14 lead against China at quarter time. The Canadian team was spearheaded by three team players from Quebec: Maude Jacques and Élodie Tessier, who went on to score 15 points; and Rosalie Lalonde, who was not far behind with 13. Arinn Young followed with 10 points. But China fought back in the second term, and the Canadians had no answer to Tian Jiao Lei, who scored 35 points. Maude was eventually fouled off, and China won 57–75.\nDay 3.\nThe third day opened with the match between Canada and Japan. Canada proved too good, leading at every break and coasting to a 65–36 win, its first of the tournament. Arinn Young, Rosalie Lalonde and Erica Gavel were the top scorers for Canada with 18, 14 and 10 points respectively. Young's bag included a three-pointer and an impressive three from three attempts from the free throw line. Japan's top scorers were Maya Hagino with 15, followed by Yui Kitama with 11.\nA far more equal contest was the second game of the day between Germany and Australia. Australia led by three points at quarter time, but Germany fought back in the second, outscoring Australia 14–10 to lead by a point at the long break. A see-sawing contest saw each side score ten points in the third quarter, leaving the margin unchanged at 30–31 at three-quarter time. But when the Australian Devils came back on the court after the break they scored eleven unanswered points. Germany was unable to catch up, and Australia notched up another win, the final score being 40–49. Australia's top scorer was one pointer Sarah Vinci with 13. Georgia Munro-Cook scored 12, and Georgia Inglis and Amber Merritt scored 10 points each. Germany's Barbara Groß scored 18 points and took 13 rebounds, while Linda Dahle scored 14 points and took 9 rebounds.\nThe third match of the day was between the two unbeaten teams, China and Great Britain. Britain's defensive pressure was intense, and its scoring was accurate. Great Britain led at each break, piling on 16 points to China's 10 in the first quarter, 14 to 10 in the second, and 28 to 11 in the third, running away to a 70–45 victory. Britain's Jordanna Bartlett scored 26 points and took 11 rebounds; Amy Conroy scored 18 points, including four from four attempts from the free throw line, and Laurie Williams notched up 16 points. China's top player was Jiameng Dai, who scored 24 points and took 13 rebounds. This left Great Britain as the only undefeated team in the competition.\nDay 4.\nThe fourth day of competition opened with the match between Germany and Canada. Both sides needed a win keep their semifinal hopes alive. Germany moved to a four-point 14–10 lead at quarter time, but this was erased by five unanswered points to Canada immediately after the break. Germany fought back to lead by five points 26–10 at half time, only to be outscored by six in the third quarter to be a point down at three-quarter time. Canada was able to outscore a tiring Germany again in the final quarter to post a four-point win, their second of the completion. Leading the scoring for Canada was Arinn Young with 26 points and 12 rebounds. Germany's Linda Dahle had 23 points and 10 rebounds, while Barbara Groß scored 10 points and had 13 rebounds.\nThe second match of the day pitted undefeated Great Britain against Japan, a side yet to post a win. Japan gave Great Britain little trouble, and Great Britain took the opportunity to give young players some court time – one of the objectives of the tournament. Every player spent at least 14 minutes on the court, and all had at least one shot at goal, resulting in all but two getting on the scoreboard. Amy Conroy with 16 points, Jordanna Bartlett with 14 and Leah Evans with 12 points led the scoring, but 15-year-old Katie Morrow scored 8 points and took 7 rebounds, and Japan was left scoreless in the third quarter. Its leading scorer was Maya Hagino with 12 point. The final siren saw Great Britain win 67–22.\nAustralia and host nation China had both also lost to Great Britain. The third match of the day saw them face off against each other. Australia took an early 14–5 lead, but China pegged this back to 18–11 at quarter time. Halfway through the second term the scores were level, but Australia took a four-point lead into the half time break. Relentless pressure from China saw the lead evaporate, and Australia slipped to four points down at three-quarter time, and then to seven points down. What followed was a remarkable fightback, with Australia levelling the scores with less than three minutes to go. The final seconds of play saw Australia up by two points, 60–58, with Australia's Georgia Monro-Cook holding the ball and patiently awaiting the final siren.\nDay 5.\nThe last day of round-robin competition opened with the match between Germany and Great Britain. Great Britain established an early ascendency, leading by 16–7 at quarter time, and 30–11 at half time. After this, both sides took the opportunity to give their newer players more court time. The final siren saw Great Britain post a 50–22 win, completing a clean sweep of the round-robin phase. Amy Conroy led the scoring again, with 23 points, and she also took six rebounds. Germany's lead scorer was Barbara Groß with 10 points.\nThe next match, between Canada and Australia, was a very different affair. A convincing win by Canada would send Australia into a semi-final against undefeated Great Britain. Australia started out strongly, posting an 18–10 lead at the first break, but Canada fought back in the second quarter, scoring 26 points to Australia's 13 for a five-point lead at half time. Problems with the scoreboard temporarily halted play. In the champions' quarter, the tide turned again, with Australia outscoring Canada 22–9 to establish an eight-point lead at three-quarter time, a lead that only inexorably increased in the final quarter. Canada had no answer to the Australian defensive press, nor to speed of Amber Merrit, who eventually scored 34 points. She was backed up by George Monro-Cook and Sarah Vinci with 14 each. In the last minutes Canada conceded defeat and replaced its lineup, and Australia followed suit, winning the game in the end 73–57 – Australia's highest score of the tournament. Canada's Arinn Young scored 20 points and took 14 rebounds.\nThe final round-robin match between China and Japan was a one-sided affair. China never looked threatened, and ran away to a 74–28 win. Tian Jiao Lei and Gui Di Lv scored 22 points each, closely followed by Jiameng Dai with 18. Japan's star player was Maya Hagino with 20 points, including a three-pointer, and nine rebounds.\nFinals.\nFifth place game.\nThe finals round began with the game for fifth place between Germany and Japan. With little at stake, Germany gave everyone a run; none of the German players spent more than 30 minutes on the court. A disappointed Germany won 46–38. Once again, Barbara Groß was lead scorer, with 18 points, and ten rebounds. Hagino was again Japan's top scorer with 17 points.\nSemi-finals.\nSemi-finals were held that afternoon. The first was between Great Britain and Canada, who had faced each other in the opening game. Canada got off to a quick start, but Great Britain was able to secure an 11–8 lead at quarter time. This was quickly erased after the break with a three pointer by Arinn Young. Great Britain then scored ten unanswered points, and wound up with a 34–21 lead at half time. Canada brought on Alarissa Haak, adding another tall player in addition to Arinn Young. They managed top peg back Great Britain's lead, but only to 47–36 at three-quarter time. Great Britain came home strongly in the final quarter, winning 67–51. Arinn Young was again Canada's top scorer with 25 points (and 13 rebounds), followed by Maude Jacques with 18 points. Great Britain's Laurie Williams and Jordanna Bartlett racked up 19 points each, followed by Amy Conroy with 17.\nThe second semi-final between the Australian Devils and the host nation was the first to attract a sizeable crowd. The crowd was pleased when China bolted to an early lead of six points at half time, but Australia fought back to a one-point deficit at half time. Relentless defensive pressure coupled with fast movement allowed Australia to secure a five-point lead at three-quarter time, and the Devils went on to win by eight points, 46–38. Notably, both sides played almost the entire game with their starting lineups: Sarah Vinci, Ella Sabljak, Georgia Inglis, Georgia Monro-Cook and Amber Merritt for Australia; and Xue Jing Chen, Man Liu, Tian Jiao Lei, Jia Meng Dai and Si Ting Huang for China. Jess Cronje briefly replaced Georgia Munro-Cook, and Gui Di Lv replaced Tian Jiao Lei for the last 15 minutes. Top scorers Amber Merritt for Australia, and Jia Meng Dai for China, both of whom scored 23 points.\nBronze medal match.\nThe bronze medal match pitted the host nation against Canada. China took an early lead but was unable to capitalise on it against a gallant Canadian team, and the first quarter ended with China holding only a narrow four-point lead. Efforts by China to increase their lead and by Canada to narrow it came to naught in the second quarter, which ended with both sides scoring 14 points. A three-pointer at the start of the third quarter from Arinn Young saw the margin narrowed to just one point, but China held on, and eventually increased its lead to six points. Canada was unable to close the gap, and the final siren saw China win by eight points. Arinn Young scored 24 points, including two three-pointers, followed by Maude Jacques with 13. China's lead scorer was Tian Jiao Lei with 24 points, while Jia Meng Dai had 19.\nGold medal match.\nThe gold medal match between Australia and Great Britain was a hard-fought affair. Relentless defensive pressure by both sides led to shot clock violations and missed shots at goal, resulting in a score of just 6–6 at quarter time. Australia kept Britain scoreless for much of the second quarter, and moved to a narrow 11–15 lead at half time. The lead was erased in the third quarter, which ended with Britain holding a one-point lead. The final quarter began with Britain scoring ten unanswered points, a deficit that Australia was unable to overcome, and Britain won 44–35. Once again, Britain's lead scorers were Amy Conroy with 19 and Jordanna Bartlett with 13. Australia's Amber Merritt racked up 21 points.\nMVP and All Stars.\nMVP and All Stars for the competition were announced at a banquet on the evening after the final:"

        "text": "The women's individual time trial cycling event at the 2015 European Games in Baku took place over a distance of 25.8 km on 18 June starting and finishing at Bilgah Beach. The course of the race was quite flat and not very technical with a turning point halfway.\nEllen van Dijk from the Netherlands won the time trial with force majeure ahead of Hanna Solovey from Ukraine and Annemiek van Vleuten from the Netherlands.\nRace.\nIn the morning of the competition it was sunny with a very strong wind. Because the wind was stronger than the days before, Ellen van Dijk chose another wheel for her bike before the start.\nThe first rider started at 10:00 with one minute between every rider. For a long time the intermediate and final times of Annemiek van Vleuten from the Netherlands, who started early in the competition, were the fastest times. The intermediate time of Hanna Solovey from Ukraine was seven seconds faster than Van Vleuten. A bit later Ellen van Dijk from the Netherlands, the main favorite who started last, was 14 seconds faster than Solovey. On the finish line the Russian Tatiana Antoshina finished just a few seconds slower than Van Vleuten. Solovey was on the finish about half a minute faster than Van Vleuten and Van Dijk was subsequently half a minute faster than Solovey. Ellen van Dijk was very pleased with her win: \"It is the first European Games and that is quite special. This was a race I have been preparing for, for a long time. I have been training at high altitude. I wanted to be very strong in this period and that worked out great. It was very tough today, especially with the wind, but then again it's the same circumstances for everyone. I was able to get into a rhythm quickly and I could keep up the pace. This is what I can do, but it didn't feel particularly great on this course. It's hard to concentrate when it's only one straight road ahead. There's not much to do while riding. You just have to push and push.\""

        "text": "Buckeye Gymnastics is an American women's artistic gymnastics academy, with two locations in Westerville and Powell. It was home to Olympic Champion Gabby Douglas during her 2016 Olympic comeback.\nHistory.\nBuckeye Gymnastics was founded in November 1982 by former Ohio State University gymnast, David Holcomb and partner Alan Ashworth. January 1983 in a 4,600 square foot facility, and served merely 52 gymnasts at that time. Buckeye Gymnastics then moved to a new, larger building in 1986. During this time PanAmerican Games gymnast Tracy Butler trained at the gym. Holcomb became the sole owner of the gym in the late 1990s after acquiring Ashworth’s percentage of the company.\nThe gym moved into its current building in 2001, a 15,000 square foot facility located in Westerville, which was expanded to 21,000 square feet soon afterwards, and which underwent a further 5,600 square foot expansion and renovation in 2016. As of that year, the gym trained between 1,800 and 1,900 gymnasts, cheerleaders, and tumblers per year, including several members of the US National Gymnastics team such as Gabby Douglas. The combined square footage between the Westerville complex and a secondary complex in Powell, is 50,600 square feet, and about three thousand gymnasts train at Buckeye between the two facilities.\nIn 2018 Buckeye Gymnastics advocated his gymnasts stepping forward to support those who had suffered abuse in the Nassar case and who had treated some gymnasts who trained at the gym, though none were among those who had been abused. In reply to the investigation into Nassar, Holcomb stated that, “I think the entire gymnastics community is speaking with one voice … It’s not just about winning medals. The medals only mean anything if our athletes have been taken care of.” Holcomb first enacted proactive youth safety policies in the mid-2000s.\nBuckeye Classic Gymnastics Competition.\nSince 1983, the gym has hosted the annual Buckeye Classic Gymnastics Competition. The event is generally held at the Ohio Expo Centre, and features several thousand gymnasts from across the US in competition across several age groups. Over the years the event has featured several future Olympians competing early in their careers, including Carly Patterson and Kerri Strug."

        "text": "Great American Gymnastics Express, known also as GAGE Center or GAGE, is an American artistic gymnastics academy, located in Blue Springs, Missouri.\nGAGE was founded in 1979 by its present-day owner and head coach, Al Fong.\nAmong the gymnasts who trained at GAGE are:\nControversy.\nThe deaths of GAGE gymnasts in 1988 and 1994 drew controversy.\nIn May 1988, Julissa Gomez broke her neck while warming up for vault at a competition in Japan. Observers had noticed her struggle with the apparatus over the months leading up to the competition, including her former coach Béla Károlyi, past and present teammates, and even her own coach, Al Fong. Gomez's technique on the extremely difficult Yurchenko vault had been described as shaky at best, and Gomez was unable to perform the vault with consistency during practices, sometimes missing her feet on the springboard. A teammate from Károlyi's, Chelle Stack, later said, \"You could tell it was not a safe vault for her to be doing. Someone along the way should have stopped her.\" However, Gomez's coaches insisted that she needed to continue training and competing the Yurchenko vault in order to achieve high scores. Gomez fell into a coma during treatment due to a hospital error and never awoke. She died in 1991.\nIn 1994, Christy Henrich died from anorexia nervosa. Her condition was allegedly spurred by comments from international judges and her coaches. Desperate to move up the ranks in the highly competitive world of Olympic-level gymnastics, Henrich took the criticisms to heart; her drive to lose a few pounds progressed to unhealthy eating habits and, eventually, became full-blown anorexia nervosa. She weighed 47 pounds when she died. Her death led to changes in the way coaches across the nation implement nutrition in training, and how television and media discuss gymnasts' bodies."

        "title": "ESPN NBA Basketball (video game)",
        "text": "ESPN NBA Basketball (alternatively known as NBA 2K4) is a 2003 basketball simulation video game developed by Visual Concepts and published by Sega. It is the fifth installment in the \"NBA 2K\" franchise and the successor to \"NBA 2K3\". It was released in 2003 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Allen Iverson is the cover athlete of the game (and is his last cover). \"ESPN NBA Basketball\" is the predecessor to \"ESPN NBA 2K5\" in the \"NBA 2K\" series. It is the penultimate NBA 2K game before being sold by Sega company to form 2K Sports. It is also the first game to feature the ESPN logo full-time and the only game not to feature \"2K\" in its title, but was instead featured \"2K4\" on the cover art.\n\"ESPN NBA Basketball\" simulates the experience of the National Basketball Association, as well as basketball in general, and features a mix of realistic NBA games, and arcade style play. Players play NBA basketball games with real teams, as well as playing street basketball with customizable players. NBA games feature commentary, pregame shows, and other affects. Several improvements to the game were made; new dribbling, dunking, shooting, and passing systems are introduced, while the visuals and sound were also improved. A hip hop focused soundtrack is present. The game features several game modes, such as 24/7, a mode where the player creates their own basketball player and takes on NBA stars, and online multiplayer, which is a first for the series.\n\"ESPN NBA Basketball\" received a positive reception upon release, with some critics calling it the best basketball game available for the Xbox and PlayStation 2. Positive comments were mostly concerning the game's wealth of content, visuals, and overall gameplay.\nGameplay.\n\"ESPN NBA Basketball\" is a basketball simulation game that simulates the experience of the National Basketball Association, as well as basketball in general, and features a mix of realistic NBA simulations, and arcade style play. The game features several game modes, such as 24/7, a mode where the player creates their own basketball player, and online multiplayer. Players play NBA games with real teams and players, as well as playing street basketball with customizable players. NBA game simulations feature commentary from Bob Fitzgerald (and is the first time to call him by that name instead of Bob Steele) and Tom Tolbert, and pregame shows by Kevin Frazier. The game features online multiplayer for the first time in the \"NBA 2K\" series.\nSeveral gameplay improvements and additions were made. The passing game for example has been rebuilt; instead of one type of basic pass, the player can freely choose from basic, behind the back, between the legs, or alley-oop passes. The previous dribbling system has been replaced by IsoMotion, a system that features many animations, allows the player to perform hesitations, in-and-outs, or ankle breakers, and emphasises quick timing and reflexes.\n24/7 mode is one of the game's main features. The player creates their basketball player, customizing the physical appearance (facial features, hair, skin colour, accessories, jersey, etc.), and journeys across the United States, competing against other basketball players, including NBA stars, in tournaments or street pickup games. The player completes different challenges in different types of events against their opponent(s). For example, the player's goal in one event could be to get five dunks in a one-on-one game, while in another, the player may be tasked with completing a five-on-five event without getting a shot blocked. The player upgrades their basketball player's abilities and attributes, thus getting better, unlocks different animations, and equips different accessories, as they complete events. The player also improves their \"rank\", which in turn, unlocks more events or items, and improves the player's reputation, allowing the player to play with certain players and take on bosses.\nIn addition to the 24/7 mode, online multiplayer, and local multiplayer game modes, the game features other modes, such as quick play. The player may play playoff games, play through a full NBA regular season, practice in an empty arena, play street basketball games, which are considerably different to regular NBA games, as well as manage a team in the franchise mode, where players can fire coaches and other personnel, trade players, and play through the NBA.\nDevelopment.\nAllen Iverson is the cover athlete of the game. This is the final time he appeared on an \"NBA 2K\" cover; Iverson appeared on the cover of the first five games in the \"NBA 2K\" series.\nUnlike past games in the \"NBA 2K\" series, every NBA player in the game features a unique facial design, giving the game more realism.\nRelease.\nThe game was released worldwide in 2003 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox. \"ESPN NBA Basketball\" is the only game in the \"NBA 2K\" series not to feature \"2K\" in the title, but instead featured \"2K4\" on the cover art. It is also one of two games in the series (the other being \"ESPN NBA 2K5\") to have \"ESPN\" in the title and featured in the game itself.\nReception.\n\"ESPN NBA Basketball\" received \"favorable\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\nGame Revolution's review cited the graphics, game modes, and online features as positives, and the unpolished mechanics of rebounding and isolation play as negatives. The review concluded, \"With its excellent graphics and myriad game modes, \"ESPN NBA Basketball\" is a good, strong title. The gameplay quirks like rebounding difficulty and the canned animations are there and can be frustrating, but are easily overlooked when you take in the big picture. It holds its own in the paint.\"\nIGN's Jon Robinson said: \"Sure, the addition of a pro hop button and the separation of the shoot and dunk buttons would make the game all the better, but even without those features, \"ESPN NBA Basketball\" is still overall the best playing basketball game this season. For the first time, basketball fans have an excuse to be playing a game at four in the morning. It's 24/7, the life of a baller. Forget Jon Robinson. The life of Jrob Andsteal has now begun. See you on the courts.\"\nGiancarlo Varanini of \"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine\" praised the gameplay, calling it \"nearly flawless\", the \"top-notch\" commentary, the 24/7 mode, which was commended for its addictiveness, and the visuals. Varanini had minor complaints about certain gameplay aspects, mostly the controllability while on a fast break. He concluded, \"There's just so much to like about \"ESPN NBA Basketball\" that any basketball fan--casual or hardcore--would be deemed insane for even considering passing it up.\"\nBob Colayco of GameSpot said: \"While there are a small handful of faults with the game, \"ESPN NBA Basketball\" has just about everything a hardcore NBA fan could ask for. It includes a tough, but rewarding, simulation-style of gameplay, a feature-packed franchise mode, street-style game modes, and the truly unique 24/7 gameplay mode that might be good enough to be its own game. If you're a hardcore NBA fan with an Xbox or PlayStation 2, your game library just isn't complete without a copy of \"ESPN NBA Basketball\".\""

At 4:40 pm EDT, play was called for the day with the second wave of players yet to tee off. Only three groups, nine players, finished their first rounds. Andrew Landry, who was ranked 624th in the world and had to go through local and sectional qualifiers, was the leader at 3 under par, with a birdie putt on his last hole, hole 9. Amateur Scottie Scheffler was the leader in the clubhouse at 1 under par.\n\"Friday, June 17, 2016\"\nAfter more rain overnight, nearly three inches (7.5 cm) total since Wednesday, play resumed at 7:30 am under mostly sunny skies and the round was completed shortly after 3 pm. Landry, the overnight leader, had a cushy end to his round: he only brought his putter to the course, to which he sank his birdie putt to lead at 4-under par. He would not play another hole for the rest of the day (see round 2).\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 17, 2016\"\nPlay was suspended due to darkness at 8:43 pm with 27 players of the first wave still on the course and the second wave of players yet to tee off. Dustin Johnson completed his round and was tied for the lead with Andrew Landry, who had not started his second round yet, at 4 under par.\n\"Saturday, June 18, 2016\"\nThe 27 members of the first wave resumed their rounds and the second wave began theirs at 7 am. The second round was completed after 2 pm; 67 players made the cut at 146 (+6) or better.\nAmateurs: \"Rahm (+5)\", Scheffler (+7), Suh (+8), Burns (+9), Horsfield (+9), Hardy (+10), Mueller (+10), Crawford (+12), Bard (+15), Danielson (+19), Stachler (+24)\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 18, 2016\"\nThe round began at 3 pm, on split tees in groupings of three; the final grouping of Dustin Johnson, Andrew Landry, and Scott Piercy teed off at 5:01 pm and completed 13 holes.

Andrew Landry bogeyed 14 and 15, but birdied 17 and 18 to move into the final pairing. Daniel Summerhays birdied 15 and eagled 17 to climb into a tie for fourth.

Dustin Johnson shot a 69 and won his first major, three shots ahead of three runners-up. After finishing at five under par, Johnson was penalized a shot as he was judged to have made his ball move as he addressed it on the fifth green, despite being initially absolved of wrongdoing. His score was amended to four under par, but he still finished three strokes ahead. The top four of the leaderboard were the only ones left under par.\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nControversy.\nDuring the final round of the tournament, there was a controversial incident on the fifth green that involved eventual winner Dustin Johnson. As he prepared to address the ball for a par putt, his ball moved slightly. Johnson stepped away, saying that he had not addressed the ball. After he spoke to an on-site rules official, he was told to carry on with his shot and sank the putt. Later, on the 12th tee, an official informed him that he might be penalized a stroke, but that no decision would be made until the round was complete. The penalty was ultimately assessed against Johnson which still left him three strokes ahead of three second-place finishers. Several of the world's top golfers, such as Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, and Rickie Fowler, as well as many viewers on their local Fox stations and spectators at the course, took to social media to criticize the USGA for its decision.\nMedia.\nFor the second year, Fox Sports televised the championship in the United States. The first two rounds were on FS1 cable and over-the-air on Fox, with the last two rounds shown only on Fox. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was carried by Sky Sports."

Jimmy Walker went into the final round with a single shot lead over Jason Day, and two shots ahead of Brooks Koepka and Henrik Stenson.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, July 31, 2016\"\nThe third round pairings were kept for the final round, and the final pair of Jimmy Walker and Robert Streb teed off shortly after their scheduled time of 3:16 pm EDT. Walker made no bogeys (or worse) during the final round, with all pars on the front nine, then made two consecutive birdies, the first by holing out from the greenside bunker on the 10th hole. His third and final birdie came at 17 for a three-shot lead over defending champion Jason Day, who quickly responded with an eagle on the 72nd hole, narrowing the margin to one shot. \nWalker won wire-to-wire by making a par putt on the final hole to win by a stroke. With Walker's win, it was the first time since 2011 that all four major golf championships were won by first-time winners.\nDue to course conditions, the fourth round was played with preferred lies, allowing players to \"lift, clean and place\" their balls on the fairways.

Australia bowler Doug Bollinger signed for the club for the 2014 season. Other new additions to the squad included fast bowlers Mitchell Claydon – who had a load spell with Kent in 2013 – from Durham, David Griffiths from Hampshire and former Kent player Robbie Joseph.\nWith young off-spinner Adam Riley getting an extended run in the side, James Tredwell signed a short-term loan deal with Sussex in order to play first-class cricket in Division One of the County Championship. He continued to play List A and T20 cricket for Kent during this time.\nKent had a slightly better season than in 2013, but remained struggling in mid-table of the County Championship Division Two and again made little impact in the NatWest t20 Blast. They did however reach the semi-finals of the Royal London One-Day Cup, where they were beaten by Warwickshire.\nBowler Mark Davies was forced to retire from playing in September after failing to recover from a shoulder injury. At the end of the season, and having lost his place in the first team to Sam Billings, former England wicket-keeper Geraint Jones left the county to join Gloucestershire as four-day captain after 15 seasons with Kent.\nJames Tredwell continued to earn international recognition for England in 2014, taking 23 wickets in 20 One Day Internationals (taking his total to 59 wickets in 44 ODIs) and 4 wickets in 10 T20 Internationals (for a career total of 7 wickets in 17 T20Is). Tredwell featured in all of England's matches at the 2014 World Twenty20.\nOther List A Matches.\nTour Matches.\n2014 Sri Lanka tour of England"

The Tribe were led by thirteenth year head coach Tony Shaver. The team played its home games at Kaplan Arena and remained members of the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA). This was the 111th season of the collegiate basketball program at William &amp; Mary. They finished the season 20–11, 11–7 in CAA play to finish in a three way tie for third place. They advanced to the semifinals of the CAA tournament where they lost Hofstra. Despite again securing twenty wins for the season, the Tribe failed to secure back-to-back postseason tournament bids for the first time in program history. Along with the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons, this was only the second time in program history that William &amp; Mary won twenty games during three consecutive seasons.\nPrevious season.\nThe team tried to improve upon their 20–13 (12–6 CAA) record from the 2014–15 season that saw the team fall short, for the second straight year, of a conference championship with a 61–72 loss to Northeastern in the championship game of the 2015 CAA men's basketball tournament. The Tribe ultimately received an automatic bid to the National Invitation Tournament, where they lost in the first round to Tulsa. The Tribe also saw the graduation of the program's all-time leading scorer, Marcus Thornton. Thornton, who was drafted by the Boston Celtics in the second round of the 2015 NBA draft, is currently playing for the Sydney Kings in the Australian National Basketball League.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#115740; color:#B9975B;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#115740; color:#B9975B;\"| CAA regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#115740; color:#B9975B;\"| CAA Tournament"

Led by the school's 8th head coach Jay Wright in his 15th year, the Wildcats were members of the Big East Conference and played most of their home games at The Pavilion, with some select home games at the Wells Fargo Center. The Wildcats finished the season with a record of 35–5, 16–2 to win the Big East regular season. They lost in the championship of the Big East tournament to Seton Hall. The Wildcats earned an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as a No. 2 seed. In the Tournament, they defeated UNC Asheville, Iowa, Miami, and overall #1 seed Kansas to earn a trip to the Final Four, the fifth in school history (although the 1971 Final Four season was vacated by the NCAA). In the Final Four, the Wildcats routed No. 2 seed Oklahoma by the largest margin in Final Four history to face No. 1 seeded North Carolina for the national championship. Led by Final Four MOP, Ryan Arcidiacono, the Wildcats won the National Championship on a three-point shot by Kris Jenkins, assisted by Arcidiacano, as time expired. The Wildcats won the school's second national title, having previously won the 1985 NCAA tournament.\nTheir 35 wins were the most in school history, breaking a record of 33 wins set the previous season. In beating No. 3 seed Miami (AP No. 10), No. 1 seed Kansas (AP No. 1), No. 2 seed Oklahoma (AP No. 7) and No. 1 seed UNC (AP No. 3), Villanova became the first school in 31 years — since the 1985 Villanova Wildcats — to not only beat four top-three seeds on the way to a national title but to also beat four straight opponents ranked in the AP top 10, in addition to beating AP ranked Iowa in the Round of 32, by an average victory margin of 19 points per game. Villanova's run included two of the ten most offensively efficient games in the analytics era (2002–present), beating Miami and Oklahoma by scoring 1.56 and 1.51 points per possession in the Sweet Sixteen and Final Four, respectively. It has been called perhaps the most dominant tournament championship run of all time, and the most dominant of the analytics era by a wide margin.\nPrevious season.\nThe Wildcats finished the 2014–15 season 33–3, 16–2 in Big East play to win the Big East regular season championship. They defeated Marquette, Providence, and Xavier to become champions of the Big East tournament. They received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament as a No.1 seed where they defeated Lafayette in the Second Round before losing in the Third Round to NC State.\nWith their 31st win of the season, a 63–61 win over Providence in the semifinals of the Big East tournament, the Wildcats set a single season record for wins, which would eventually finish at 33.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#013974; color:white;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#013974; color:white;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#013974; color:white;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#013974; color:#white;\"| NCAA tournament\nRankings.\nOn February 8, the Wildcats became the first Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team to reach number one in the AP Poll."

        "title": "Andy Hill (basketball)",
        "text": "Andrew William Hill (born ) is an American former basketball player and current author and motivational speaker. He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins, winning three national championships in the early 1970s under Coach John Wooden. After a brief career playing professionally overseas, Hill entered the entertainment industry. He became president of two media companies, CBS Productions and Channel One News. He reconnected with Wooden after 25 years, and they co-wrote a best-selling book based on the application of Wooden's coaching principles to the business world. \nEarly life.\nHill was born and raised in Los Angeles in the Westwood area, and is Jewish. His father was emotionally detached and abusive. Growing up, Hill watched the UCLA basketball team around town before Pauley Pavilion was built, and dreamed of playing for them and Coach John Wooden.\nHe went to high school at University High in West Los Angeles. A skilled shooter, playing guard on the University High Warriors basketball team Hill was the unanimous pick for Western League Most Valuable Player (MVP) as a senior in 1968, when he was the second-leading scorer in Los Angeles at 27.2 points per game. For the second straight year, he earned first-team All-Los Angeles City honors. He was considered one of the top prospects in the country.\nCollege career.\nHill attended UCLA on a basketball scholarship, and in 1969 averaged 19 points and 8 assists per game and shared MVP honors on the freshman team with Henry Bibby, the squad's leading scorer (26.8).\nHe was selected for Team USA to play in the 1969 Maccabiah Games. However, when he asked UCLA's athletic director J.D. Morgan if he could play in the Games, Morgan replied that if he did so the NCAA would not allow him to play again for UCLA when he returned.\nHill won three straight National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championships as a member of the varsity UCLA Bruins under Wooden. However, the backup guard played sparingly, and took just 99 shots in those three years. UCLA had many talented players during that era, and many of those who ended up being reserves arguably would have started on other teams.\nWooden chose not to play Hill much, believing that teammates such as Bibby and Kenny Booker were better players. However, Hill was convinced that his political views and outspoken nature were directly related to his lack of playing time. He clashed with Wooden over politics and the handling of reserve players, and the coach once suggested that he transfer schools. Given the poor relationship he had with his father, Hill craved for Wooden to be a father figure. Nonetheless, Hill came to feel neglected and believed that Wooden did not like him. He graduated in 1972 thinking he would never see Wooden again.\nProfessional basketball career.\nHill had a brief stint playing professionally in Israel for Maccabi Ramat Gan. He then returned to the U.S. and coached at Santa Monica College for a few years in Southern California.\nEntertainment industry.\nHe discovered that coaching did not suit him, and entered the entertainment industry when he was 28. He became an accomplished movie and television executive with Columbia Pictures Television, and established his own production company. From 1991 though 1996, Hill was the president of CBS Productions, leading the development and production of programming owned by the network. He oversaw some of the most successful primetime shows of the decade, including \"Touched by an Angel\"; \"Caroline in the City\"; \"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman\"; \"Walker, Texas Ranger\"; \"Dave's World\"; and \"Rescue 911\". With other romantic comedy options in the works, CBS' programming department passed on \"Caroline In the City\". However, Hill was convinced it was a hit program, and found a buyer for the show in NBC. It was the first series that NBC had bought from a rival network, as well as the first one that CBS had sold to a competitor. Hill called NBC's decision \"the most important statement CBS Productions has ever made about our legitimacy in this business.\"\nIn 1996, Hill asked to be released from his CBS contract to join MCA Inc., but his boss—CBS Entertainment President Leslie Moonves—refused. However, Hill left CBS the following year. From 1997 until 2000, he was president of programming for Channel One News, where he produced award-winning news programming for an audience of eight million American teens.\nAfter 25 years had passed since he last saw Wooden, Hill was reminded of his former coach while playing golf. Hill's playing partner advised him to \"Don't hurry, get your balance\", which evoked a Wooden maxim of \"Be quick, but don't hurry.\" Realizing that the coach's teachings had subconsciously guided his life and career, Hill was inspired to contact Wooden, and they developed a close friendship. \"Once we were away from basketball, from my thinking I should play more, I could see [Wooden] did care about me,\" Hill said.\nHe co-wrote \"Be Quick—But Don't Hurry! Finding Success in the Teachings of a Lifetime\" with Wooden. The bestseller details how Hill applied his experience as a player under Wooden to achieve success in his career as a television executive. His goal was to demonstrate the relevance of Wooden's coaching style to the business world. The book also delves into his personal relationship with Wooden as his coach and mentor. After publishing the book, Hill became a motivational speaker on leadership and life coaching.\nHonors.\nIn 2016 he was inducted into the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame."

        "text": "In the 2014 Irish cricket season, Ireland hosted three international series, against Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka A and Scotland, losing the two against Sri Lankan teams, but beating Scotland. In domestic cricket, Leinster Lightning won two of the three competitions, while North-West Warriors won the other.\nInternational cricket.\nOne Day International series against Sri Lanka.\nPrior to their series against England, the Sri Lanka national cricket team visited Ireland in May to contest two ODIs, both hosted at Clontarf Cricket Club Ground in Dublin. In the first match, Ireland won the toss and invited Sri Lanka to bat first. Tim Murtagh was described as being \"almost unplayable\" by Ger Siggins of ESPNcricinfo, and the Irish bowling attack was generally praised for maintaining pressure on Sri Lanka, who were restricted to 219 for eight from their 50 overs. During their response, Ireland lost too many early wickets, struggling to 74 for seven. They were eventually dismissed for 140, giving Sri Lanka a 79 run victory. Ajantha Mendis was named man of the match for taking three wickets and conceding only 27 runs. The second ODI, two days later was abandoned without any play because of rain, granting Sri Lanka a 1–0 series victory.\nList A series against Sri Lanka A.\nA couple of months after their series against Sri Lanka, Ireland were visited by Sri Lanka A, who played a three match \"unofficial ODI\" series, which were given List A status. The first two matches were played at Civil Service Cricket Club Ground in Belfast, while the third was scheduled for Lodge Road, Coleraine. Sri Lanka A lost the toss in the first match and were asked to bat first. After losing a wicket in the first over, Mahela Udawatte and Danushka Gunathilaka shared a 106-run partnership. Thereafter, the team regularly lost wickets and completed their innings 283 all out. In reply, Ireland never established a significant partnership, with only Stuart Poynter, who scored 109 runs, making a significant score, and Ireland lost by 28 runs. Sri Lanka A batted first again in the second match, and half-century scores for four of their first five batsmen helped to propel them to a score of 329 for eight. The captain, Ashan Priyanjan was the team's top-scorer, with 111 runs. Poynter opened the innings for Ireland, but was dismissed first ball, and his fellow opener, Andy Balbirnie, followed two overs later. Stuart Thompson scored a half-century, but five wickets from the leg-spinner Seekkuge Prasanna helped Sri Lanka A to a 107 runs victory. As in the ODI series, the final match was abandoned due to rain, so Sri Lanka A won the series 2–0.\nOne Day International series against Scotland.\nLate in the season, during September, Scotland travelled to Ireland to play three ODIs at the Malahide Cricket Club Ground in Dublin. The Irish squad was largely similar to that which faced Sri Lanka A, though John Mooney, Kevin O'Brien, George Dockrell and Max Sorensen returned to the squad. Ireland won the toss and chose to bowl first, and regularly took wickets to restrict Scotland to a total of 172. Craig Young became the ninth player to take five wickets during their ODI debut, to help bowl Scotland out after 40 overs and three balls. Ireland chased the target down easily, aided by a half-century from O'Brien, to win by seven wickets. Scotland fared better in the second match after once again being invited to bat first; an unbeaten century from Richie Berrington helped his side reach 221. O'Brien was Ireland's leading run-scorer again, with 67 runs, and despite losing a few wickets once O'Brien was dismissed, Ireland reached the target with over five overs to spare. Shortly before the third match of the series, an interview with Mooney was broadcast on \"RTÉ Sport\", in which he spoke about his battle against depression which had forced him to take a break from international cricket. During the match, he was received a standing ovation for his score of 96, which held the Irish innings together, though they finished on a below-par score of 241. Scotland's off-spiiner, Majid Haq, collected five wickets in the innings. In their reply, Scotland lost the wicket of Matthew Cross in the second over, but a partnership of 182 between Calum MacLeod and Hamish Gardiner helped to seal their only victory of the series, with the former reaching his second ODI century.\nDomestic cricket.\nLeinster Lightning won the 2014 Inter-Provincial Championship for the second successive year, finishing with three wins and draw from their four matches. They also won the 50-over Inter-Provincial Cup, in which they won all four of their matches, but they finished as runners-up in the Twenty20 competition, with North-West Warriors winning the Inter-Provincial Trophy. North-West batsmen dominated the batting tables, as three of the four players to top 200 runs in the Championship; Craig Ervine scored the most, accruing 224. A North-West player also topped the bowled charts, James Cameron-Dow, though the three next best bowlers all played for Leinster.\nThe Irish Senior Cup and Alan Murray Twenty20 Cup finals were both contested between Clontarf and The Hills. The Hills finished as Senior Cup winners, claiming a nine-run victory, aided by half-centuries from Cormac McLoughlin and Michael Baumgart. In the Twenty20 competition, Clontarf took a more comprehensive win, scoring 142 runs, including 60 from Andrew Poynter, and then bowling The Hills out for 95."

Bouts also had a maximum time of three minutes each; if the final bout ended before either team reached 45 touches, the team leading at that point won. A tie at that point would result in an additional one-minute sudden-death time period.

Founded in 1904, it has been an affiliated member of the Golfing Union of Ireland since 1940.\nHistory.\nThe origins of golf in Tuam go back to the early 1900s when two local businessmen holidayed in the town of Harrogate in England. There, they became acquainted with the game, purchased clubs and balls and brought them back to Tuam. Initially located in the townland of Cloonascragh (on land owned by one of the two businessmen), Tuam Golf Club opened in 1904 with 60 members. In 1937 it relocated to the lands of the Kilgarriff family at Mayfield.\nIn 1948 Christy O'Connor Snr came to the club as a professional, offering golf lessons to the local community. \nIn the mid-1970s, the club moved to its current location at Barnacurragh, with the course designed by Eddie Hackett.\nIn 1991 a new clubhouse was constructed, with bar, restaurant, changing rooms and a pro-shop. Improvement works continued over the years with Christy O'Connor Jnr advising the club. Other development work undertaken between 2007 and 2009 was under the guidance of golf architect Ken Kearney.\nTuam Golf Club granted full membership to lady members in 1992.\nTuam Golf Club has hosted several championship events, including the Connacht GUI Club finals, and The Irish Open Boys Championship.\nCourse.\nThe course is Par 72, measuring 6138 meters, with most fairways being tree lined, with water features on three holes. The feature hole is the Par 3 15th hole, which is played from an elevated tee, over water to a sloping green."

        "text": "The equestrian statue of Absalon on Højbro Plads in Copenhagen was unveiled in 1902 to mark the 700 years' anniversary of the death of Bishop Absalon, the city's legendary founder.\nDescription.\nThe statue depicts Absalon as a military commander, mounted on a rearing horse, wearing mail and a helmet, holding an axe in his right hand. The statue faces Christiansborg Palace on Slotsholmen, where Absalon's bishop's castle once stood, but he turns his head to the right, looking in the direction of Copenhagen City Hall.\nThe lower part of the plinth is made of granite and designed for seating. The upper part is built in red brick. A frieze at the bottom of the upper part features a school of fish and wavy lines, symbolizing Øresund and the herring fishing which in Absalon's day significantly contributed to the wealth of the small fishing hamlet. Other decorations include Viking ornamentation. On the front side is a coat of arms with a rosy cross and two intersecting Keys of Heaven, a reference to Absalon's status as Bishop of Roskilde. At the top of the plinth is another frieze with lettering in relief. On the front side, it reads: \"1128 ABSALON 1201\". Beginning on the right hand side, a scroll around the three other sides reads: \"He was brave, clever and visionary / a lover of learning / with a clean will the loyal son of Denmark\" (Danish: \"Han var modig, snild og fremsynet / en ynder af lærdom / med ren vilje Danmarks trofaste søn\").\nHistory.\nThe statue was a gift to the City of Copenhagen from Axel Heide, managing director of Privatbanken. Vilhelm Bissen was charged with the design of the statue while Martin Nyrop designed the plinth. Heide originally wanted the statue to be unveiled on Absalon's birthday, 21 March, but it was delayed by the City Council who wanted to reserve this date for the unveiling of another Absalon statue. situated above the main entrance on the façade of the new city hall. The statue was instead unveiled on 30 November 1902. Heide also wanted Georg Brandes to give a speech at the unveiling ceremony but this was rejected by the political establishment who found his liberal views too controversial. Heide then proposed that the bishop of Zealand could also speak at the ceremony but this compromise was also rejected. When Crown Princess Louise threatened to close her accounts in Privatbanken, Heide finally accepted to cancel Brandes."

        "text": "The Ateneo Blue Eagles are the women's collegiate varsity volleyball team of the Ateneo de Manila University. They compete in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP).\nHistory.\nThe Ateneo Blue Eagles women's volleyball team was formed in 1975. They first played competitive varsity volleyball when they participated in the women's volleyball tournament of the NCAA (Philippines) in Season 51 (1975–76). The following year, Season 52 (1976–77), the Lady Blue Eagles won their first and only NCAA women's volleyball championship. They were unable to defend their title in the NCAA because Ateneo de Manila transferred to the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) in 1978. The team did not win a championship for the next 37 years.\nSherwin Malonzo was appointed as the head of the volleyball program in 2008. In Season 71 (2008–09), Roger Gorayeb was hired as head coach of the Lady Eagles. That same year, Ateneo began to recruit high school players. Five blue-chip high school players (Fille Cainglet, Jem Ferrer, Dzi Gervacio, Gretchen Ho and Ailysse Nacachi) were recruited, and were later dubbed the Fabulous Five by the Ateneo community and fans. Another group of five high school players was recruited the following year. In 2010 Ateneo recruited highly prized UST high school volleyball player Alyssa Valdez, as well as four other high school players. Valdez was a national youth volleyball team standout, dubbed the \"Phenom\" by the sports press, and a three-time MVP in UAAP high school volleyball. On January 20, 2013, she broke the UAAP volleyball record, by scoring 35 points (31 spikes, 3 blocks and 1 service ace) in the second round elimination game. Prior to her performance, the record had been 33 points, set by an Adamson University player on February 14, 2009.\nIn 2011 they won the championship of the Shakey's V-League, a summer tournament which the Ateneo Lady Blue Eagles use as a preparation for the UAAP tournament.\nTheir first title in the UAAP came in Season 76 (2013–14), and they won the title again the following year in Season 77 (2014–15), beating second-seeded De La Salle University in 2 matches. The sweep achieved a 16–0 season record (elimination rounds to championship round), a first for any UAAP women varsity team in the Final Four era. Their third and most recent title was won in Season 81 (2018–19). Prior to these championships, they had nine Final Four appearances (Seasons 70, 72, 73, 74 and 75), with a second seed and twice-to-beat advantage in Season 74 and 75. In Season 72 (2009), the three Ateneo varsity volleyball teams – men's, women's and boys' were in the Final 4."

(Before 1997, the age cutoff was 14.)\nUSA Gymnastics, the governing body for gymnastics in the United States, generally names the teams each summer after the National Championships, but gymnasts are sometimes added to or removed from the rosters based on their performance at training camps throughout the year. Thus, some gymnasts listed under a given year were on the national team for only part of that year. \nGymnasts on the junior national team may be moved to the senior national team midyear upon turning 16. In these cases, the gymnasts are listed in the senior national team section for that year."

        "title": "David Jordan (rugby union)",
        "text": "David Jordan is a former CEO of the Glasgow Warriors, a professional Scottish rugby union club playing in the Pro14. He is now the tournament director of the Pro14 league.\nJordan started as the chief executive officer of Glasgow Rugby in July 1997. After six weeks in the post there was an office, a receptionist and a spiritual home in Scotstoun.\nHe was quoted as wanting more autonomy from the SRU in buying players: \"Once we get into the European season as such, I want to start concentrating on the strategic objectives of Glasgow rugby. Those are long-term and to be worked in partnership with the clubs.\" But to do that, he argues, Glasgow needs more autonomy from the SRU to prepare properly.\n\"I intend to work closely with the clubs to identify talent to bring into the city,\" he says. \"I want to get together with the clubs and form a shopping list of players, for example exiles, who would strengthen Glasgow rugby. We want to promote Glasgow rugby and ensure more competitive clubs are at the top level. We will target players together with clubs and offer them packages. That is to happen more next year because the registration period for players for this year has passed. But I hope that the district can get more autonomy from the SRU.\"\n\"At present, all players' contracts are negotiated centrally with the SRU. I hope that the district will be able to negotiate directly with players, for if we wish to bring in top players, and use the combined power of clubs and districts to do that, then we need to have more say in the matter,\" says Jordan. \"Whatever we do, we have to do it hand in hand with the clubs in our district.\"\nHe bemoaned the nomadic existence of the Glasgow club as Glasgow Rugby and Glasgow Caledonians. \"As a team whether as Glasgow or Glasgow Caledonians we have trained at Stirling, Dalziel, Scotstoun, Hughenden and Whitecraigs, and played games in Aberdeen, Inverness, Perth, Stirling, Ayr, Hughenden, Firhill and Scotstoun, and while we’ve worked hard recently to make Hughenden a home we’re only there on match days and the players, physios, admin staff etc are scattered all over the place.\"\nJordan was to fall victim of cost cutting at the SRU and lost his job in January 2005.\nDespite that he hoped that his involvement in getting Scotstoun to be re-developed as a sporting facility would ultimately benefit Glasgow Warriors. \"Because we have been closely involved for the past two years we have been able to help with a design which has cut the athletics track from ten lanes to eight, and ensured there are no long jump pits in front of the stand, to really get supporters as close to the rugby as possible, and while there is still a bit to go yet before it is finalised, if it was up and running as planned in 2007 I'd feel quite proud of the work we've done.\"\nThe deals that Jordan worked on, involved Glasgow Warriors being given full operational and commercial control as anchor tenants of a Scotstoun Stadium, with a 6078 capacity, in 2007 – and a short term move to Firhill. \"We've been working hard on this project with Glasgow City Council over the past two years and it is very exciting for professional rugby here. It will give us a home we can call our own and a single location we can use for all Glasgow representative matches – at age grade as well as pro level – along with an administrative and training base. The SRU have been involved in the discussions all the way down the line, because we cannot sign anything as Glasgow Rugby.\"\nAlthough Scottish Rugby appointed Charles Shaw as Glasgow Warriors chairman in October 2006, it was left to 2007 that another CEO was appointed to run the club, replacing Jordan. Ian Riddoch became the Warriors new CEO in July 2007, after first being appointed as interim general manager in June 2007.\nOn leaving the Glasgow Warriors as CEO, Jordan was appointed tournament director of the Celtic League in February 2005 and – after that evolved into the Pro12 League – became the tournament director of the Pro12; still his present role."

Australian participation was sporadic until the 1980s.

In 1991, the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) established a road cycling program under Head Coach Heiko Salzwedel. This program lead to the development of many future Australian touring cyclists including Robbie McEwen, Patrick Jonker, Michael Rogers and Henk Vogels. In conjunction with the AIS road cycling team, the AIS track cycling program under the guidance of Charlie Walsh was developing endurance track riders including Stuart O'Grady, Bradley McGee and Brett Lancaster. Cadel Evans who won the Tour in 2011 was an AIS mountain bike scholarship holder in the lead up to the 2000 Sydney Olympics. By 2010, there were 11 Australian cyclists on the Tour.

Before that, he served as Pennsylvania's first Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs from 2012 to 2017. He was appointed by Governor Tom Corbett, re-appointed by Governor Tom Wolf in 2015 and was dismissed by Wolf in 2017.\nBiography.\nTennis graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1980.  Prior to that, he taught junior highschool in Pittsburgh from 1975 to 1977.  He was a Rhodes Scholar Nominee for the University of Tulsa, where he graduated in 1975.\nTennis worked in the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office from 1980 until 2006. As chief of the Legislation Unit from 1986 to 2006, he served as the legislative liaison for the Pennsylvania District Attorney's Association, working primarily with the Pennsylvania General Assembly. In his position, Tennis emphasized the importance of legislation that strengthened access to and resources for drug and alcohol addiction treatment within and outside of the criminal justice system.\nAs chair of the District Attorney's Hiring Committee from 1986 to 1993, Tennis founded the Minority Hiring Committee, that worked successfully to recruit African-American, Latino-American and Asian-Pacific American law students and lawyers to become prosecutors.\nFrom 1992 to 19933, Tennis served under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton as  Executive Director of the President's Commission on Model State Drug Laws, a bipartisan group of state attorneys general, district attorneys, judges, mayors, police chiefs, treatment and prevention experts, and legislators. After five public hearings across the nation addressing the issues of Economic Remedies, Community Mobilization, Treatment, Drug Free Families, Schools &amp; Workplace, and Crimes Code, the Commission published a five-volume report with forty-four model laws in those areas, enhanced by policy statements and section-by-section commentary for each law.\nAfter completion of the work of the President's Commission, the group formed the National Alliance on Model State Drug Laws (NAMSDL), a congressionally-mandated and funded nonprofit organization.   NAMSDL supports states in the adoption of the Model Laws and other effective, cost-beneficial, proven legislation and policies to reduce drug and alcohol abuse.  Tennis served on the board from 1993 to 2017, and as chair from 2010 to 2015. In July, 2017 Tennis stepped down from the Board to become NAMSDL's president and chief executive officer.\nTennis also served as treasurer on the Board of the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Authority Directors from 2014 to 2017, and has, since 2016, served on the Board of the National Association of Drug Court Professionals.\nIn 2016, Tennis received the Philadelphia Psychiatric Society's Benjamin Rush Award.  In 2015, Tennis received the national Ramstad-Kennedy Award, as well as the Pennsylvania Rural Health Leader of the Year.  In 2014, he received the NASADAD Award for Exceptional Leadership and Support of Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment. That year, he also received the Rehabilitation &amp; Community Providers Association Administrative Leadership Award, the first ever government official to receive the award from that group.\nIn January 2017, the \"Reading Eagle\" alleged that Tennis had involved lobbyists in the hiring process at the Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs. He was dismissed shortly thereafter by Governor Tom Wolf. Two days after his termination, Tennis presented reporters with written documentation refuting this report, stating that the Governor's Press Office had prohibited him from supplying the \"Reading Eagle\" with the documentation prior to the news story. Tennis repeated for reporters Governor Wolf's explicit statement to him that the reason for the termination was because of his decision to publicly oppose the Governor's plan to downgrade the Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs to a bureau within the Department of Human Services. This plan to downgrade the department, which was unveiled a few weeks later, was ultimately rejected by the Pennsylvania Legislature."

        "title": "Rose Bowl (cricket ground)",
        "text": "The Rose Bowl, known for sponsorship reasons as Utilita Bowl, is a cricket ground and hotel complex in West End, Hampshire. It is the home of Hampshire County Cricket Club, who have played there since 2001.\nIt was constructed as a replacement for the County Ground in Southampton and also the United Services Recreation Ground in Portsmouth, which had been Hampshire's homes since 1882. Hampshire played their inaugural first-class match at the ground against Worcestershire on 9–11 May 2001, with Hampshire winning by 124 runs. The ground has since hosted international cricket, including One Day Internationals, matches in the 2004 Champions Trophy, two Twenty20 Internationals and Test matches in 2011, 2014 and 2018, when England played Sri Lanka and India. In 2020, the ground was used as one of two biosecure venues, alongside Old Trafford, for the tours involving West Indies, Pakistan and Ireland which were regulated due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn order to be able to host Test cricket, the ground underwent a redevelopment starting in 2008, which saw stands built to increase capacity and other construction work undertaken to make the hosting of international cricket at the ground more viable. A four-star Hilton Hotel with an integrated media centre overlooking the ground opened in 2015. Following Hampshire Cricket Ltd finding itself in financial trouble in 2011, the lease on the ground was sold to Eastleigh Borough Council for £6.5 million with a benefactor injecting a similar sum in 2012.\nThe Rose Bowl played host to the inaugural final of the 2019–21 ICC World Test Championship between India and New Zealand, resulting in New Zealand being crowned inaugural World Test Champions.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nHampshire had played at their Northlands Road headquarters in Southampton since 1885, as well as using Dean Park in Bournemouth, the United Services Recreation Ground in Portsmouth and May's Bounty in Basingstoke as regular outground venues. Northlands Road was a cramped location, surrounded by residential buildings which meant expanding the ground was largely impossible. Hampshire also wanted to encourage international cricket to the county, which would not have been possible with Northlands Road. Talk of a move from Newlands Road had begun as early as 1987, with Mark Nicholas discussing the idea with then Hampshire vice-chairman Bill Hughes in a Leeds restaurant. A site was eventually selected just outside Southampton, in West End, on a gently sloping field owned by Queen's College, Oxford located between the M27 motorway and Telegraph Woods.\nThe ground was designed by architect Sir Michael Hopkins, whose design of the centrepiece pavilion with its tented roof was reminiscent of the Mound Stand at Lord's, which Hopkins also designed. Construction started on the ground in 1997, however, the budget for the ground's construction soon spiralled out of control, threatening the very existence of the club. Further funding was secured as construction continued until its first stage was completed in time for the 2001 season. Its final cost was £20 million, with a large part of that cost being secured with Lottery and Sport England funding, while the club's financial future was secured by the incoming chairman, Rod Bransgrove.\nThe ground is built into the side of the gently sloping hill on which it is located, resulting in an amphitheatre bowl. The initial name for the ground was announced in 2000 as The Rose Bowl, in recognition of the club's rose and crown logo and the bowl-shaped nature of the ground.\nEarly years.\nHampshire's first scheduled county match at the ground was a List A match in the 2001 Benson &amp; Hedges Cup against Essex on 2 May, though the match was abandoned without a ball bowled due to rain, therefore the first completed match on the ground was a List A match in the same competition against Surrey on 4 May, which Hampshire lost. First-class cricket was first played there days later on 9–11 May, when Hampshire played Worcestershire in the County Championship, which resulted in Hampshire's first victory there with a 124 run victory. Hampshire were not the only tenant in the first year of the ground, with the Hampshire Cricket Board playing Ireland in September 2001 in the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy.\nIn November 2001, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) awarded the Rose Bowl a Youth Test match between England Under-19s and India Under-19s. The following month the ECB announced the Rose Bowl would be awarded One Day International status with effect from 2004. The pavilion was completed in March 2002 at a cost of £2 million, and upon completion it was the only pavilion among the first-class counties to have jacuzzis in the players changing rooms.\nIn 2003, the ground played host to only the second ever Twenty20 match played, when Hampshire hosted Sussex in the Twenty20 Cup. The Rose Bowl hosted its first One Day International (ODI) on 10 July 2003, when South Africa played Zimbabwe in the 2003 NatWest Series, with numerous publications calling the hosting of the match a resounding success for Hampshire.\nIn 2004, the ground hosted another ODI between New Zealand and the West Indies in the 2004 NatWest Series, though the match was abandoned without a ball bowled. The ground later held five ODIs during that seasons Champions Trophy, which saw India post 290/4 against Kenya, the United States dismissed for 65 by Australia, and Mervyn Dillon take figures of 5/29 for the West Indies against Bangladesh: all three of these records remain to this day in terms of the highest and lowest innings scores in ODI cricket at the ground, as well as the best innings bowling figures. During the course of the tournament, England also played there for the first time, against Sri Lanka, though The Rose Bowl was criticised for its organisation of the match, with spectators citing access to the ground, long queues and stringent searches at the gate among complaints.\nIn 2005, England played their first ever Twenty20 International (T20I) against Australia as part of the Ashes series, with England winning the match by 100 runs.\nIn 2006, England played another T20I against Sri Lanka, which England won, due in large to Marcus Trescothick's 72. The Rose Bowl hosted three further ODIs prior to the grounds redevelopment, hosting Pakistan in 2006, India in 2007 and Australia in 2009. The ground held Twenty20 Cup Finals Day in 2008, which saw Middlesex defeat Kent in front of a capacity crowd. Prior to the redevelopment, major matches such as this match and international matches were catered for by erecting temporary seating to boost the grounds capacity from 6,500 to 15,000.\nThe early years at the ground were notable for immature wickets that favoured seam bowling, resulting in many low scoring encounters. The quality of these pitches drew much criticism. In the first season, seamer Alan Mullally took 8/90 against Warwickshire in the County Championship, which remains the best innings bowling figures at the ground. As the pitches settled down, higher scores became more frequent, though it was still more favourable to bowlers than batsmen. In 2005, Hampshire scored 714/5 against Nottinghamshire, in a match which also saw John Crawley record the first triple century at the ground. His unbeaten 311 helped Hampshire to reach that formidable total. These records remain to this day as the highest team and individual scores at the venue. Worcestershire posted the lowest first-class total at the ground in 2007, making 86.\nExpansion.\nThe attraction of international cricket to Hampshire was one of the main motivators facilitating Hampshire's move from Northlands Road. While Hampshire had attracted ODI cricket, Test cricket still proved elusive in attracting. Hampshire had applied to the ECB for the venue to be given Test status, applying as early as 2006 for the right to host Test matches, however their application was rejected, with Glamorgan's SWALEC Stadium instead preferred to host a Test match during the 2009 Ashes series. This rejection persuaded Hampshire chairman Bransgrove to invest £35 million in redeveloping the ground, which would include the construction of a new access road to alleviate the transport problems which have affected major matches, the expansion of the ground's capacity and the construction of a hotel to make the Rose Bowl more financially viable for Hampshire. By the time permission had been granted for the first phase of the redevelopment to commence, costs had risen to £45 million.\nThe plans called for the construction of two matching stands either side of the pavilion to increase the permanent capacity to 15,000, as well as a four-star, 175-room hotel overlooking the ground at the northern end. Access problems for spectators were to be eased by creating two ticket gates to access to ground, as well as creating an additional access road off Moorhill Road.\nThe redevelopment plans led to the ECB awarding the Rose Bowl Test status and a Test match between England and Sri Lanka in 2011, with the redevelopment scheduled to be completed before the Test match. The redevelopment was beset with a number of problems. During the construction of the new stands, a construction worker was crushed to death in February 2009, while prior to the Test match the new access road still had not been constructed. Meanwhile, legal action by local hoteliers led to the construction of the hotel at the Northern End being put on hold, with the hoteliers objecting to the possible impact on competition and to the use of public funds from Eastleigh Borough Council.\nAs part of their preparations for the Test match, the Rose Bowl was awarded the right to host finals day of the 2010 Friends Provident t20, during which Hampshire became the first county to win the final at their home ground, when they defeated Somerset in controversial circumstances. Also in 2010, the Rose Bowl was voted \"Best International Ground\" in an independent ECB survey of fans around the country and was also voted the \"Most Improved Ground\" by readers of \"All Out Cricket\" magazine.\nThe first Test match was played on 16–20 June 2011. It was a heavily rain affected match that ended in a draw, but did see Ian Bell and Kumar Sangakkara score the first Test centuries at the ground, in addition to Chris Tremlett taking the first five wicket haul.\nHampshire found themselves £12 million in debt by the end of the 2011 season. With the county unable to maintain the upkeep of the ground from their own finances, the decision was taken to sell the lease from Queens College Oxford (the Landlord) to Eastleigh Borough Council and to sub-lease from the council with buy-back options. This transaction was conditional on a further injection of £6million from Rod Bransgrove and was completed in January 2012. The council also administered some £30million Prudential Funding from Central Government for the building of the hotel, which was given the go-ahead after the legal action by local hoteliers was quashed at the High Court.\nOn 29 August 2013, the Australian opener Aaron Finch set a new record for Twenty20 international cricket when he scored 156 runs off 63 balls for Australia against England at the Rose Bowl. Finch's innings included 14 sixes (also a record) and 11 fours. The previous record was 123 runs, scored by Brendon McCullum of New Zealand. In 2020 the ground was used as one of two biosecure venues, alongside Old Trafford, for the tours involving West Indies, Pakistan and Ireland which were regulated due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNaming rights.\nThe cricket club announced in February 2012 that a six-year sponsorship deal had been signed with Ageas, an insurance provider headquartered in nearby Eastleigh. The deal included naming rights for the ground, which officially became known as the Ageas Bowl. The deal was extended, but in June 2023 the insurer announced that the partnership was coming to an end at the end of the season. In January 2024, a new deal was announced with Utilita Energy, with the official name of the venue becoming the Utilita Bowl.\nFacilities and functions.\nBesides the main cricket ground at the Rose Bowl, an additional satellite ground borders the main ground to the south-east. Known as the Nursery Ground, it hosts Hampshire Second XI matches at the Hampshire Academy in Southern Premier Cricket League matches. Its end names are the Northern End and the Golf Club End. Its pavilion is named after Arthur Holt, who coached Hampshire from 1949 to 1965. The Nursery Ground has hosted one first-class match, Hampshire v Loughborough MCCU in April 2013.\nThe main pavilion, now known as the Rod Bransgrove Pavilion, holds the players facilities, as well as facilities for club members, such as the Robin Smith Suite, Derek Shackleton suite, the Richards Suite, the Greenidge Suite and The Hambledons (a suite named after the famous Hambledon Club). Located between the pavilion and the cricket academy building is the atrium restaurant. The cricket academy, which has six lanes of cricket nets is used by county squads, the Hampshire Academy, cricket clubs and schools. It is known to have some of the best facilities of its kind outside of Lord's and is available for hire by the general public. The two new stands include permanent catering facilities along the internal concourse of the ground floor, which were lacking prior to the redevelopment. Also located on the ground floor of the west stand is the club shop. Both of the new stands contain suites which can be used for conferences and exhibitions outside of match days. The stands are named after two of Hampshire's most popular captains, Colin Ingleby-MacKenzie and Shane Warne.\nAlso part of the Rose Bowl complex is the Boundary Lakes Golf Club, an eighteen-hole golf course opened in 2017 and set in the rolling countryside which surrounds large parts of the main stadium. The current clubhouse and golf shop are located in the Hilton Hotel. It is hoped the course will be able to host major championship golf tournaments in the future. A David Lloyd health club (formerly Virgin Active) is also onsite.\nEvery November the venue hosts one of the largest fireworks displays on the South Coast. It also acts as a venue big-name music concerts. Recent acts to have performed there include Oasis in 2005, who performed in front of 35,000 people, Billy Joel in 2006, the Who in 2007, Neil Diamond and R.E.M., both in 2008, Rod Stewart in 2016, Bryan Adams and Little Mix, both in 2017. Arctic Monkeys in 2023 The late Italian opera singer Luciano Pavarotti was due to play at the ground in 2006, but cancelled his farewell UK tour due to ill health.\nList of centuries.\nTest centuries.\n a total of 8 centuries have been scored in international test cricket on the ground.&lt;ref name=\"Statsguru: Test matches / Batting records / Innings by innings list\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nOne-Day International centuries.\n a total of 23 centuries have been scored in one-day international cricket on the ground.&lt;ref name=\"Statsguru: One-Day Internationals / Batting records / Innings by innings list\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nList of five-wicket hauls.\nTest match five-wicket hauls.\n, 12 five-wicket hauls have been taken in international matches on the ground, eight in Test matches and four in ODIs."

        "text": "The Masters Review is an American literary magazine and book publisher based in Portland, Oregon. Established in 2011 by founding editor Kim Winternheimer, the publication serves a platform for publishing and discovering new and emerging writers. Since its inception, The Masters Review has been honored by the Independent Publisher Book Awards for Best Short Story Collection by the American Library Association and Foreword Reviews, a fellowship from Oregon Literary Arts for the work it does for new writers, and has stories recognized in The Best of the Net, The Best Small Fictions, and The Million Writers Award, among others. It is distinguished from many other notable literary magazines by actively seeking work from previously unpublished writers.\nWorking with authors Lauren Groff, A. M. Homes, Lev Grossman, Kevin Brockmeier, Amy Hempel, and Roxane Gay, The Masters Review produces a printed volume of ten stories annually, which showcases and promotes emerging writers. It also publishes fiction and narrative nonfiction by new writers online, as well as stories and essays from guest writers including: Kate Bernheimer, Ben Loory, Manuel Gonzales, Julia Elliot, and Ottessa Moshfegh, to name a few.\nThe publication hosts several contests year round, including its notable Short Story Award for New Writers, which is held twice yearly and awards cash prizes, publication, and connects writers with literary agencies looking for new talent.\nThe Masters Review (Online).\nThe Masters Review publishes a great deal of its content online.

They are open to writers with published story collections and writers with novels that were self-published or saw a circulation below 3000 copies, as showcased in Portland Monthly. The Masters Review accepts submissions and essays from writers around the world as long as stories are written and submitted in English.\nAnnual Anthology.\nThe Masters Review printed anthology serves as a major endorsement for new writers. Printed annually, a guest judge contributes an introduction and selects ten writers from a shortlist to be published in the collection. Aside from national distribution and high visibility in the printed work, the anthology is also part of an exclusive mailing to agents, with the aim of connecting new writers with representation. The Masters Review Volume III with stories selected by Lev Grossman received an INDIEFAB medal for Best Short Story Collection.\nNew Voices.\nNew Voices appear online throughout the year. This category invites emerging writers to submit fiction and narrative nonfiction, selected by The Masters Review staff. New Voices stories include winners and finalists in The Best Small Fictions, The Best of The Net, and Million Writers Award, to name a few.\nWriters whose work has appeared in \"The Masters Review New Voices\".\nA full list of authors can be found at \nFeatured Fiction.\nThe Masters Review provides Featured Fiction, or stories written by established guest writers to appear online throughout the year.

        "text": "David Thompson (born August 28, 1993) is an American professional baseball third baseman who is a free agent. He played college baseball at the University of Miami. He was drafted by the New York Mets in the 4th round of the 2015 Major League Baseball draft.\nAmateur career.\nThompson attended Westminster Christian School in Miami, Florida. He played baseball, football and basketball. During his career he hit 55 home runs which broke the Florida state record for career home runs which had been held by Alex Rodriguez. He was also a quarterback in football, throwing for 2,055 yards and 20 touchdowns with 11 rushing touchdowns as a senior. Thompson was drafted by the New York Yankees in the 38th round of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign.\nThompson originally committed to the University of Miami to play both college baseball and college football. However, he left the football team to focus on baseball full-time. As a freshman, Thompson started 51 of 52 games between first and third base. He hit .286/.368/.462 with six home runs and 46 runs batted in (RBIs) over 182 at-bats. As a sophomore, he played in only 30 games due to a blood clot and thoracic outlet syndrome. In 108 at-bats he hit .278/.368/.352 with 15 RBIs. After the 2014 season, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Orleans Firebirds of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and was named a league all-star. Thompson returned to Miami in 2015 and was named a finalist for the Dick Howser Trophy.\nProfessional career.\nNew York Mets.\nThe New York Mets selected Thompson in the fourth round, with the 119th overall selection, of the 2015 MLB draft. After signing with the Mets, Thompson made his professional debut for the Brooklyn Cyclones of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League. He spent the whole 2015 season in Brooklyn, where he batted .218 with three home runs and 22 RBIs in 59 games. Thompson spent 2016 with both the Columbia Fireflies of the Class A South Atlantic League and the St. Lucie Mets of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League; he ended 2016 with a combined .280 batting average, 11 home runs and 95 RBIs between both teams. In 2017, he played for the Binghamton Rumble Ponies of the Class AA Eastern League, where he posted a .263 batting average with 16 home runs and 68 RBIs in 133 games. He played in only 25 games in 2018 due to injury. In 2019, Thompson split the year between Double-A Binghamton and the Triple-A Syracuse Mets, slashing .217/.290/.348 with 9 home runs and 45 RBI in 123 combined games.\nThompson did not play in a game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, he spent the majority of the year with Triple-A Syracuse, batting .228/.329/.470 with 13 home runs, 39 RBI, and 10 stolen bases in 67 games. He elected free agency following the season on November 7, 2021.\nKansas City Monarchs.\nOn March 28, 2022, Thompson signed with the Kansas City Monarchs of the American Association of Professional Baseball. Thompson played in 73 games for the Monarchs, hitting .346/.432/.636 with 19 home runs, 63 RBI, and 15 stolen bases. He was named an All-Star for the team in 2022. On April 6, 2023, Thompson was released by the Monarchs."

        "text": "Whilst the sport of rugby league is played across Great Britain, it is most popular in its heartlands, the traditional counties of Yorkshire and Lancashire with the majority of professional and semi-professional clubs coming from this area of the country. Many fixtures are considered to be local derbies, where both teams come from the same town or city, or two that are very close to each other.\nThe 19th Earl of Derby stated in 2010 that the \"Derby\" name was originally only given to two sporting events: the Epsom horse race and fixtures between St Helens at one end of the family's Knowsley estate and Wigan at the other.\nDerbies.\nBattle of the Borough Derby.\nThe \"Battle of the Borough” refers to the rivalry between two teams from the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan - Leigh Leopards and the historically more dominant Wigan Warriors.\nThis rivalry has been absent for most of the Super League era with the two teams only competing in the same division on five occasions - 2005, 2017, 2021, 2023, and 2024.\nCalder Derby.\nThe Calder Derby is contested between Castleford Tigers and Wakefield Trinity, with both Wakefield and Castleford being part of the City of Wakefield metropolitan borough, which the River Calder flows through.\nHistorically Wakefield have been the more successful side, winning two league titles and five Challenge Cups. However, Castleford have been the more successful side in recent years winning five out the six games played in the 2014 and 2015 season by large margins. In terms of silverware, Castleford have also been the most successful in modern times winning three Challenge Cups since 1969 and appearing in five finals. Wakefield have only appeared in one final during this period. In 2006, Wakefield Trinity and Castleford met on the final day of the Super League season with the losing team facing relegation to National League One. Wakefield would go on to win the match 29-17 which relegated Castleford.\nBoth clubs also have a local rivalry with Featherstone Rovers, however this rivalry is not as strong due to competitive games between these sides nowadays being rare as Featherstone have played most of their recent seasons in the Championship. Before the Super League era, Featherstone derbies between Castleford, Featherstone and Wakefield were more closely and bitterly contested.\nCheshire Derby.\nThe Cheshire Derby is a local derby between Warrington and Widnes. Both towns lie in the traditional county of Lancashire, but have been administered as part of Cheshire since 1974.\nBoth teams struck up a rivalry in the mid and late 20th century being local rivals and being somewhat dominant forces in the Challenge Cup, Widnes being known as the Cup Kings in the late 1970s and 1980s. Widnes were relegated in 2005, not returning to the Super League until 2011, whilst Warrington began to challenge the dominance of sides such as Leeds, Wigan and St Helens at the top.\nCumbrian Derby.\nThe main derby in Cumbria is between Whitehaven and Workington Town, just a few miles apart from each other and connected by the A595 in the traditional county of Cumberland.\nBoth Whitehaven and Workington have a rivalry with Barrow Raiders in southwest Cumbria, in the traditional Furness area of Lancashire. The rivalry between Barrow and the other Cumbrian sides isn't as pronounced as travelling between Barrow and West Cumbria is difficult because of the terrain and the local roads.\nEast Lancashire Derby.\nThe East Lancashire Derby takes place between Oldham Roughyeds and Rochdale Hornets, both teams are based in the east of the traditional county of Lancashire close to the Yorkshire border. The two teams contest The Law Cup as a pre-season friendly on an annual basis.\nFrench Derby.\nDespite not having played each other since both club's time in the Elite One Championship together (2000 to 2006), the tie between Catalans Dragons and Toulouse Olympique was labeled the French Derby following Toulouse's promotion to the Super League in 2021.\nGood Friday Derby.\nThe Good Friday Derby is contested between Wigan Warriors and St. Helens. Named as such as they traditionally meet on Good Friday (and also Boxing Day before Super League saw the sport switch to a summer schedule). The towns of St Helens and Wigan lie only eight miles apart in the traditional county of Lancashire. The two clubs have been the most successful clubs in England winning 31 Challenge Cups and 33 league titles between them. They have also met in three Grand Finals in the Super League era.\nHeavy Woollen Derby.\nThe Heavy Woollen Derby is a local derby contested between Batley Bulldogs and Dewsbury Rams. Both the towns of Batley and Dewsbury are in the Heavy Woollen district of Yorkshire, an area named after the heavy woollen cloth that was manufactured there in the 1800s.\nHull Derby.\nThe Hull Derby is contested by Hull F.C. from the west side and Hull Kingston Rovers from the east side of the city of Kingston upon Hull. The two teams are separated by the River Hull. In the late 1990s a merger was proposed between the two clubs to form a team known as Humberside or simply Hull but this was later rejected. The rivalry was at its highest during the 1980s when both Hull sides were the dominant forces in the league. The Hull Derby is considered to be one of the most fierce in Rugby League due to both of the clubs residing from within the same city.\nLeeds Derby.\nThe Leeds Derby is contested between Leeds and Hunslet. Leeds play in the north Leeds district of Headingley whilst Hunslet is a district in southern Leeds. The rivalry between Leeds and Hunslet has become very one-sided due to Leeds becoming one of the so-called big four sides in recent times, whilst Hunslet have rarely played in the top division in decades. Therefore, the two teams rarely meet in competitive fixtures. There was also a third Leeds Derby until Bramley folded in 2000.\nFrom 1912, Leeds and Hunslet F.C. played an annual pre-season friendly for the Lazenby Cup. The tradition was revived in the 2004 and was renamed in 2017 as the Harry Jepson OBE Memorial Cup. The next Leeds Derby is 2 February 2024 as Rhinos take on Hunslet at the South Leeds Stadium.\nLocker Cup Derby.\nThe Locker Cup Derby is contested between Lancashire teams Warrington Wolves and Wigan Warriors. The teams are two of the most successful in England and their rivalry has greatly intensified since 2010 due to the rise in success of Warrington Wolves. The rivalry has varied in intensity throughout history with both clubs having stronger rivalries with Widnes Vikings and St Helens respectively.\nLondon Derby.\nThe London Derby is contested between London Broncos and London Skolars; these teams being the only professional or semi-professional sides within Greater London. As yet, there isn't much of a rivalry as neither team had met in the same division until recent times, and the Broncos have played at many different grounds around London, therefore making it difficult to build a stable fan base. However they play each other in a pre-season friendly called the Capital Challenge which is held at the Artillery Grounds.\nRoses Derbies.\nGames between Yorkshire clubs Halifax and Huddersfield Giants against traditional Lancashire clubs Oldham and Rochdale Hornets are often called Roses Derbies or Wars of the Roses due to the clubs being located near the edge of the county boundaries. Meetings between Oldham and Huddersfield were particularly competitive up until the mid 1990s.\nSalford Derby.\nAn East Lancashire rivalry has previously existed with in the City of Salford exists between Salford City Reds and Swinton Lions, this fixture is also known as the Salford Derby, despite Swinton now being based in Sale.\nSouth Yorkshire Derby.\nThe South Yorkshire Derby is contested between Sheffield Eagles and Doncaster. The only competitive matches between the two have occurred in the Championship. Sheffield are the more successful team, winning back-to-back Championship titles in 2012 and 2013, and the Challenge Cup in 1998.\nWar of the Roses Derby.\nThe term War of the Roses is used to describe the rivalry between Lancashire giant Wigan Warriors and Yorkshire giant Leeds Rhinos. The two sides generated a rivalry out of being two of the best sides in the country. The term started use after the War of the Roses county of origin series was discontinued.\nWelsh Derby.\nThe Big Welsh Derby is played between the only two Welsh clubs in the professional ranks of British rugby league.\nCeltic Crusaders joined the national leagues in 2006 and were, at that time, the only Welsh side outside the amateur game. They left South Wales and moved to Wrexham in 2009. This led to Wales' second club South Wales Scorpions being formed. In 2011, Celtic Crusaders folded and the new club North Wales Crusaders were entered into League 1 in 2012.\nWest Yorkshire Derby.\nThe rivalry between the Leeds Rhinos and the Bradford Bulls is one of the great rivalries in English Rugby League and is the most common fixture termed the West Yorkshire Derby. The cities are next to one another and the teams have met in countless cup finals. During the early years of the Super League the rivalry peaked, with both Leeds and Bradford being dominant forces in Rugby League, challenging for numerous titles whilst meeting in Grand Finals and Challenge Cups. Bradford fell into financial trouble in 2011 and 2012, had not won or appeared in a final since 2005 and had to sell players to keep the club alive. The rivalry remains passionate despite Bradford's decline and Leeds continuing to win many more titles. Bradford were relegated in 2014, the first time in 40 years, ending competitive league fixtures between the sides. The most recent competitive meeting between the two sides was a Challenge Cup sixth round tie in May 2019, which Bradford won 24-22 to progress to the quarter finals.\nMany other derbies take place in West Yorkshire with specific names such as the Calder derby and the Heavy Woollen Derby. The Festive Challenge is an annual Boxing Day friendly between rivals Leeds Rhinos and Wakefield Trinity. The Castleford verses Leeds rivalry has become a more prominent derby in recent times.\nSuper League Big Four.\nIn addition to traditional local derbies, a four-way rivalry exist between the so-called Super League Big Four, reflecting the success of recent teams in certain years. These four team are usually contain the champion of every season, both in the Super League (Grand Final and League Leaders) and Challenge Cup.\nThe Big Four consists of Wigan Warriors, St Helens, Leeds Rhinos, and Warrington Wolves. Prior to 2010, Bradford Bulls was considered a Big Four member, before the rise of Warrington, the club has since dropped in performance level and now plays in the Championship."

The Federation was founded on 1 February 1992 after the dissolution of the USSR Boxing Federation. The RBF is the member of the International Boxing Association and European Boxing Confederation.\nThe IBA temporarily suspended Russian athletes from competing in international competitions starting on 4 March 2022 due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Later that month, the Federation expressed its direct support for the ongoing invasion of Ukraine, and stated: \"The entire boxing community of Russia expresses its full confidence and support to the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin!\" In October 2023, the congratulations on Putin's birthday were published on the official RBF's Instagram account. Several athletes, including 2023 World Championships medallists Edmond Khudoian and Sharabutdin Ataev, published their personal congratulations through their social media.\nUmar Kremlev has been the IBA president since 2017.\nControversy.\nOlympics 2016 Rio, Brazil.\nDuring the 2016 Olympic Games several bouts involving Russian boxers seemed to be judged in favour of the Russian athlete, when it was clear to many they had lost. Bantamweight Vladimir Nikitin was given a unanimous decision against Ireland's world champion Michael Conlan in the quarterfinal of the tournament, with judges all scoring for the Russian in rounds one and three. Afterwards, in an irate television interview, Conlan claimed AIBA were cheats and had been paid to fix fights. In order to reach the quarterfinal bout with Conlan, Nikitin was controversially awarded the win by split decision when he fought Thailand's Chatchai Butdee. According to the \"Bangkok Post\", Butdee was quoted as saying, \"I should have won the fight. I think I was more on target. I do not really understand the judges' decisions.\"\nThe day after the quarterfinal AIBA denied these allegations; however, they removed several Judges and Referees for the panel for the rest of the games over irregularities in scoring. They also stated decisions would stand."

The series was played at five venues across Australia between 23 November 2017 and 8 January 2018. England were the defending holders of the Ashes going into the series, having won in 2015. \nAustralia won the series 4–0, regaining the Ashes after taking an unassailable lead with an innings victory in the third Test.\nSquads.\nIn September 2017, Ben Stokes was named in the initial England squad, but was subsequently ruled out of international selection until further notice while a disciplinary process took place. The following month, he was withdrawn from the Ashes squad, pending an investigation, with Steven Finn added to England's squad. However, Finn himself was then ruled out of the tour, injuring his knee prior to the first warm-up game. Tom Curran was called up to replace him. James Anderson was named as England's vice-captain for the Test series in Stokes' absence. George Garton was added to England's squad as cover for Jake Ball during pre-Test tour matches, but returned to the England Lions when Ball recovered in time for the first Test.\nAustralia delayed naming its squad for the first two Tests until 17 November 2017, selecting Cameron Bancroft to replace Matthew Renshaw. Tim Paine returned to the team after a seven-year absence, ahead of Matthew Wade and Peter Nevill. Before the first Test, Glenn Maxwell was added to Australia's squad as cover for David Warner, who injured his neck at training. Mitchell Marsh was later added to Australia's squad ahead of the third Test, replacing Chadd Sayers.\nAustralia's Mitchell Starc and England's Craig Overton were both ruled out of the fourth Test, with heel and rib injuries respectively. Maxwell was replaced by Ashton Agar for the fifth Test. England's Chris Woakes was ruled out of the fifth Test due to injury.\nVenues.\nThe five venues were the Gabba, Adelaide Oval, the WACA Ground, the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the Sydney Cricket Ground.\nThe WACA Ground was expected to host its final Test during the series, prior to the opening of the new Optus Stadium. However, it was said in November 2015 that construction of the new stadium was well ahead of schedule and the Perth Test could be hosted at the new venue. A decision on the venue was made in May 2017, with the WACA Ground confirmed as the venue, as the new stadium would not be ready in time.\nIn December 2016, Cricket Australia (CA) were looking at hosting the first day/night Ashes match, with Adelaide being the likely venue. On 12 December 2016, it was confirmed that Adelaide Oval would host the first day/night Ashes Test.\nBroadcasting.\nThe series was broadcast on television in Australia by the Nine Network. As part of a five-year deal with Cricket Australia that commenced in 2016, BT Sport provided television coverage of the series in the United Kingdom and Ireland."

Basketball was the first team sport in which Greek teams won a European-wide competition. AEK won the 2nd-tier level FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup in the 1967–68 season, when they beat Slavia VŠ Praha in the final that took place in Athens.\nNevertheless, Greek basketball was actually mainly boosted following the gold medal-winning triumph at the 1987 EuroBasket and runners-up 1989 EuroBasket, by the senior men's Greek National Team. In the following decades, Greek teams have dominated in European-wide professional club basketball, winning many trophies in continental competitions. Greek basketball clubs have won eighteen European-wide titles in totality.\nGreek basketball clubs have also been runners-up in European continental-wide competition twelve times. Greek teams have won the European first-tier level competition, the EuroLeague, a total of nine times, with six EuroLeague championships being won by Panathinaikos and three EuroLeague championships being won by Olympiacos. Four Greek teams have won a European-wide second-tier level competition, the Cup Winners' Cup/Saporta Cup.\nThe Greek clubs that have won second-tier level European-wide competitions are AEK (two times), PAOK, Aris, and Maroussi. Three Greek teams have won a European-wide third-tier level cup, either the FIBA Korać Cup or the Basketball Champions League. Those clubs are Aris, PAOK and AEK. Aris has also won a fourth-tier level European-wide competition once, as they won the FIBA EuroCup Challenge.\nOverall, twenty-two Greek basketball clubs have participated in European-wide competitions. AEK, Aris, Iraklis Thessaloniki, Maroussi, Olympiacos, Panathinaikos, Panellinios, Panionios and PAOK have each played in all of the main top three different level tiers. Peristeri has played in competitions of the first and third level tiers. Apollon Patras and Ionikos Neas Filadelfeias have played in competitions of the second and third level tiers. Makedonikos has only played in competitions of the second tier level, and YMCA Thessaloniki, Sporting, Near East, Ionikos Nikaias, Papagou, Irakleio, Olympia Larissa, Olympias Patras and Promitheas Patras BC have only played in competitions of the third level tier.

In Chatman's 10 seasons as head coach, she compiled a 143–121 record and led the Spartans to NorCal championships in 1978 and 1979 and the AIAW women's basketball tournament every year from 1978 to 1981. In 1982, San Jose State women's athletics programs moved from the AIAW to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and the women's basketball team moved from the NorCal Conference to the NorPac Conference.\nChatman posted losing records during each of her final three seasons (1983–1986), and the team continued to post losing records throughout the six-season tenure of Tina Krah from 1986 to 1992 and coach Karen Smith's first season in 1992–93. Krah was 17–143 as head coach. San Jose State women's basketball joined the men's basketball program in the Pacific Coast Athletic Association (now the Big West Conference) in 1986, Krah's first season. In 1993–94, Karen Smith led the Spartans to their first winning season since 1982–83. This would be the only winning season in Karen Smith's tenure, during which San Jose State moved from the Big West to the Western Athletic Conference in 1996.\nJanice Richard replaced Smith in 1999, and the Spartans' next winning season would be in 2001–02 with a 17–11 record. Richard also led the Spartans to two straight winning seasons in 2004 and 2005. Lamisha Augustine became the first San Jose State women's basketball player drafted to the WNBA in April 2006, when the Sacramento Monarchs selected Augustine in the third round of the 2006 WNBA draft. In August 2006, Richard took a medical leave of absence to seek treatment for breast cancer.\nAssistant coaches Greg Lockridge and Derrick Allen served as interim head coaches for the 2006–07 season, a season in which the Spartans fell from 13–15 the previous season to 5–27. Lockridge was head coach for the first six games (posting an 0–6 record), and Allen took over for the last 21 games (going 5–21). The university placed Lockridge on paid administrative leave on November 30, 2006, a week after a \"San Jose Mercury News\" report that leading scorer Amber Jackson transferred after \"difficulty in dealing with\" Lockridge.\nIn April 2007, San Jose State hired former Lynn University head coach Pam DeCosta as the Spartans' head coach. DeCosta served as head coach for four seasons, during which she posted a 13–106 record.\nTim La Kose became the women's basketball head coach in April 2011 after ten seasons as head coach at Cal State Bakersfield. Under La Kose, the Spartans improved to 11–19 in 2011–12, following a 2–27 season. The Spartans had another 11–19 season in 2012–13, their final season in the WAC. San Jose State athletics programs joined the Mountain West Conference on July 1, 2013.\nOn August 30, 2013, during the first week of the fall semester, La Kose resigned, citing personal reasons. Athletic director Gene Bleymaier hired Sacramento State head coach Jamie Craighead on September 16, to replace La Kose. San Jose State had its third straight 11–19 (5–13 MWC) season under Craighead in 2013–14. In Craighead's second season, the team improved to 15–17 (7–11 MWC). Entering the Mountain West Conference women's basketball tournament as the #8 seed, San Jose State made the semifinals by upsetting #1 Colorado State in the second round. This marked the first time in tournament history the #8 seed beat the #1 seed. On January 21, 2015, Ta'rea Cunnigan broke the San Jose State career scoring record previously set by Ricky Berry (1,768 in 1988). Cunnigan ended her career with 2,062 points.\nAll-time record vs. current Mountain West teams.\nAs of the conclusion of the 2022-23 NCAA Division I women's basketball season:\nHead Coaches.\nAs of the conclusion of the 2022-23 NCAA Division I women's basketball season:"

        "text": "A cricketer scoring a century (100 runs or more) on their One Day International (ODIs) debut is regarded by critics as a significant achievement. As of December 2023, 16 players from 10 different international teams have accomplished this feat. Players representing nine of the twelve teams that have full member status have scored an ODI century on debut.\nEngland's Dennis Amiss was the first debutant to score a century in ODIs; he scored 103 runs off 134 balls against Australia during the first match of the Prudential Trophy in 1972. His total was surpassed by Desmond Haynes of West Indies when he made 148 against Australia in 1978. As of December 2023, this remains the highest individual score by a debutant in ODIs. In a 1992 World Cup game against Sri Lanka, Andy Flower made 115 not out while making his first ODI appearance, representing Zimbabwe. It remains the only World Cup century by a debutant as of the 2023 tournament. In September 1995, Pakistan's Saleem Elahi set a record for becoming the youngest player to achieve the feat; aged 18, he was yet to play first-class cricket then. Between 1972 and 1995 only four players had scored a century on their ODI debut. However, since 2009, twelve players have achieved the feat. South African Reeza Hendricks holds the record of fastest century by a batsman on ODI debut (88 balls). Of the 16 occasions a cricketer has scored a century on ODI debut, their team has lost only 3 times."

        "text": "The 42nd Ryder Cup Matches were held in France from 28 to 30 September 2018 on the Albatros Course of Le Golf National in Guyancourt, a suburb southwest of Paris. It was the second Ryder Cup to be held in Continental Europe (rather than Great Britain or Ireland), after the 1997 contest, which was held in Spain. The United States were the defending champions, but had lost the last five matches in Europe, having last won there in 1993. Europe regained the Ryder Cup, winning by 17 points to 10.\nFormat.\nThe Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point. The competition format was as follows:\nOn the first two days there were four fourball matches in the morning and four foursome matches in the afternoon.\nWith a total of 28 points available, 14 points were required to win the Cup, and 14 points were required for the defending champion, the United States, to retain the Cup. All matches were played to a maximum of 18 holes.\nBidding for the 2018 Ryder Cup.\nRyder Cup Europe confirmed originally six countries—France, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden—to be interested in bidding for the 2018 Ryder Cup. The deadline for the submission of bids was set for 30 April 2010; Sweden withdrew from the bidding early that month, while the Spanish bidding host city of Tres Cantos showed poor popular support.\nThere were five bids to host the event:\nFrance was announced as host on 17 May 2011, despite calls for the Cup to be held in Spain as a tribute to the late Seve Ballesteros.\nTeam qualification and selection.\nEurope.\nThe European team qualification rules were announced on 18 January 2017. There were a number of changes compared to 2016 with an increase in the number of captain's picks from three to four, based on recommendations from the analytics team behind Team Europe. The team consisted of:\nMembership criteria for the European Tour were reduced from five tournaments to four (outside the majors and WGCs) for the 2018 season. As in previous Ryder Cups, all players had to be members of the European Tour to be eligible to play for Europe. Changes were also made to the eligibility of future captains and vice-captains.\nPaul Casey became a member of the European Tour at the start of 2018. Since he was not a member during 2017 he did not earn points until the start of 2018.\nThe leading players in the European Ryder Cup points lists were:\nThe remaining three players selected as captain's picks, Ian Poulter, Sergio García and Paul Casey, finished in 22nd, 24th and 35th place respectively on the European points list.\nUnited States.\nThe United States qualification rules were announced on 8 February 2017. The majority of the team were selected from the Ryder Cup points list which was based on prize money won in important tournaments. Generally one point was awarded for every $1,000 earned. The team consisted of:\nThe qualification rules were similar to those used for the 2016 Ryder Cup. The points given for the 2018 season major championships were reduced from double to 50% extra (except for the winner who still received double points). The dates on which the captain's picks were made were brought forward by one or two weeks.\nThe leading 15 players in the final points list after the final qualifying event, the 2018 PGA Championship were:\nPlayers in qualifying places are shown in green. Captain's picks are shown in yellow.\nTeams.\nCaptains.\nThomas Bjørn was named as the European captain on 6 December 2016. He was chosen by a five-man panel made up of the three most recent European Ryder Cup captains (Darren Clarke, Paul McGinley and José María Olazábal), the Chief Executive of the European Tour, Keith Pelley, and European Tour Tournament Committee member Henrik Stenson.\nJim Furyk was named as the USA captain on 11 January 2017.\nVice-captains.\nEach captain selected a number of vice-captains to assist him during the tournament.\nBjørn selected Robert Karlsson as his first vice-captain in May 2017. In May 2018 he selected four more vice-captains: Luke Donald, Pádraig Harrington, Graeme McDowell and Lee Westwood. Raphaël Jacquelin was also on hand for the Europeans, as an assistant.\nFuryk named Davis Love III as a vice-captain, soon after his appointment in January 2017. He later added Steve Stricker and Tiger Woods in February 2018.\nOn 4 September 2018, Furyk named David Duval, Zach Johnson, and Matt Kuchar as additional vice-captains. Tiger Woods, who had previously been named a vice-captain, would no longer serve in this position as he was chosen to be one of Furyk's captain's picks.\nPlayers.\nThomas Bjørn announced the four captain's picks at 2 pm BST on 5 September. Captain's picks are shown in yellow. The world rankings and records were at the start of the 2018 Ryder Cup.\nCaptain's picks are shown in yellow. Jim Furyk announced three captain's picks at 5 pm EDT on 4 September. The final captain's pick was announced on 10 September after the conclusion of the BMW Championship. The world rankings and records were at the start of the 2018 Ryder Cup.\nFriday's matches.\nMorning fourballs.\nThe opening round of four fourball matches started at 8:10 am local time. Pairings were announced after the Opening Ceremony on Thursday. The first point of the 2018 Ryder Cup was won by Team USA, with Dustin Johnson and Rickie Fowler winning 4 &amp; 2 against Rory McIlroy and Thorbjørn Olesen. Despite being two up with six holes to play, Jon Rahm and Justin Rose lost out to Brooks Koepka and Tony Finau on the 18th hole, while Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas also won by one against Paul Casey and Tyrrell Hatton, putting Team USA 3–0 ahead. A spectator struck by Koepka's drive on the 6th hole lost the sight in one eye. Coming back from two down, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari defeated Tiger Woods and Patrick Reed 3 &amp; 1 to secure Team Europe's first point of the tournament, and to end the first morning 3–1 in favour of Team USA.\nAfternoon foursomes.\nEurope's first clean sweep of the afternoon foursomes in the history of the Ryder Cup saw Team Europe end the day 5–3 ahead of Team USA. Sergio García and Alex Norén won 5 &amp; 4 over Phil Mickelson and Bryson DeChambeau, Rory McIlroy and Ian Poulter came from two down after the first three holes to beat Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson 4 &amp; 2, Fleetwood and Molinari repeated their morning success with a 4 &amp; 3 win over Spieth and Thomas, while Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson beat Dustin Johnson and Rickie Fowler 3 &amp; 2. \nSaturday's matches.\nMorning fourballs.\nThe Saturday fourballs saw Europe continue to dominate with wins for García/McIlroy (2 &amp; 1) against Koepka and Finau, Casey/Hatton (3 &amp; 2) against Fowler/Johnson and Molinari/Fleetwood (4 &amp; 3) against Reed/Woods. Team USA secured their only point of the morning session with Thomas and Spieth defeating Poulter and Rahm 2 &amp; 1, to leave the overall tournament at 8–4 in Team Europe's favour. Despite the strong performance, Team Europe captain Thomas Bjørn reiterated: \"Nothing's won, we're just over the halfway stage. There's no bit happiness yet, there's still a determination and work to be done\".\nAfternoon foursomes.\nThe afternoon session was drawn 2–2. It saw Team Europe's Molinari and Fleetwood win for the fourth time, a European record in the Ryder Cup, this time 5 &amp; 4 over Woods and DeChambeau. Team USA's Spieth and Thomas defeated Poulter and McIlroy 4 &amp; 3, while Simpson and Watson's green play saw them defeat Europe's García and Norén 3 &amp; 2. The fourth pairing saw Rose and Stenson narrowly beat Johnson and Koepka 2 &amp; 1 as a result of some good putting late in the round.\nSunday's singles matches.\nThe United States put their best players at the top of the card on Sunday, and despite the four point deficit threatened a comeback in the singles, as they won 3 points from the first four matches. Justin Thomas beat Rory McIlroy on the final hole as the latter's approach found the water, and Tony Finau defeated the previously unbeaten Tommy Fleetwood 6 &amp; 4. However, from then on Europe dominated, winning the next six matches to lead 16–9. Guarantees of at least a half-point each for García and Stenson (both of whom later got full points) meant that victory was already assured before the 14-point winning post was officially reached when Phil Mickelson, already three holes down, found the water on the 16th hole and conceded the hole and match to Molinari, who became the first player for Europe to score what is now the maximum possible five points in a single Ryder Cup. Of the remaining two matches, one was won by the U.S. team and one by Europe, the last match decided with a long putt on the 18th green by Alex Norén for Europe, leaving the final score 17–10 to Europe. Sergio García's singles win made him the all-time Ryder Cup points leader, with 25 points in nine appearances, overtaking Nick Faldo's 25 points in 11 appearances. \nIndividual player records.\nEach entry refers to the win–loss–half record of the player."

        "text": "The EuroLeague Regular Season and Top 16 MVP were awards that were given out by the top-tier level European-wide men's professional club basketball league, the EuroLeague. The EuroLeague initially gave out MVP awards for both the \"regular season\" and top 16 stages of the competition (the first two group stages of the season). Since these stages of the season each only encompassed a portion of the actual EuroLeague full season, these awards were eventually phased out. \nThe EuroLeague then created the EuroLeague MVP of the Month award, which was a more fitting and appropriate award to give out instead for individual stages of the season; along with the EuroLeague Full Season MVP award, which is decided by a voting process, and covers the entire EuroLeague season, until the EuroLeague Final Four, which also has its own MVP award. \nSelection criteria.\nThe EuroLeague, under its original league format, consisted of four phases. The first phase was the \"regular season\", which was the first group stage. The second phase was the top 16 stage, which was the second group stage. The third phase was the playoffs stage, and the fourth phase was the EuroLeague Final Four stage. The Regular Season MVP was the MVP award for the first phase of the season, and the Top 16 MVP was the MVP award for the second phase of the season.\nThe Performance Index Rating (PIR) statistical formula was largely determinant in the selection process of these awards. The player with the highest PIR statistical score of the first group stage of the season was named the MVP of the regular season phase, while the PIR statistical score was also strongly emphasized in the selection of the MVP of the top 16 phase.\nEuroLeague Regular Season MVP award winners (2001–04).\nThis was an award for the first group stage of the season, which encompassed between 10-14 games in total. The award was first given in the 2000–01 season, and was awarded every season through the 2003–04 season. The first group stage was 10 games in the 2000–01 season, and it was 14 games in the 2001–02, 2002–03, and 2003–04 seasons. The player with the highest PIR statistical score was named the Regular Season MVP.\nEuroLeague Top 16 MVP award winners (2002–04).\nThis was an award for the second group stage of the season, which encompassed 6 games in total. The award was given out during the 2001–02, 2002–03, and 2003–04 seasons. The PIR statistical score and team record were emphasized in the selection of the Top 16 MVP."

        "text": "The 2015 NRL Grand Final was the conclusive and premiership-deciding game of the 2015 NRL season and was played on Sunday 4 October at Sydney's ANZ Stadium between the Brisbane Broncos and North Queensland Cowboys. North Queensland won the match 17–16 in golden point extra time, claiming their first premiership title in their twentieth year of competition. Due to its dramatic ending, the match has been regarded as one of the greatest grand finals in rugby league history, drawing comparisons with the 1989 NSWRL Grand Final and the 1997 ARL Grand Final. Cowboys co-captain Johnathan Thurston, who kicked the winning field goal for his team, was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal as the best player on the ground. Pre-match entertainment was headlined by Australian rock band Cold Chisel.\nBackground.\nThe Brisbane Broncos qualified for their first grand final appearance since 2006, and had never previously been defeated in a grand final, winning all six they have featured in – 1992, 1993, 1998, 2000, 2006, and 1997 for Super League. It was Brisbane coach Wayne Bennett's ninth involvement in a grand final after coaching the club in all of their previous grand final appearances, as well as co-coaching the Canberra Raiders to their maiden grand final in 1987 and winning a premiership title for the St George Illawarra Dragons in 2010. The North Queensland Cowboys reached the premiership deciding game for the second time in their history since their inception into the competition in 1995, after losing to the Wests Tigers in their first appearance in 2005. It was the second time in history that no New South Wales team had featured in the grand final after 2006 which featured the Broncos up against the Melbourne Storm, and is the first time that a grand final featured two Queensland-based clubs. It was also the first time that two clubs captained by Indigenous Australians played a NRL grand final.\n2015 season.\nBrisbane, who finished second in the regular season ladder, and North Queensland, who finished third, faced each other during the first week of the finals series in a qualification game, with the Brisbane side prevailing 16-12 in a tight contest at Suncorp Stadium to earn a week off and the right to host a grand final qualifier. Brisbane defeated minor premiers the Sydney Roosters 31-12 in the preliminary final at Suncorp Stadium to claim the first spot in the grand final. In losing to the Brisbane side, North Queensland were forced to play an extra week in the finals and faced the sixth-placed Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks at their home venue of 1300SMILES Stadium, beating them convincingly 39-0. They then qualified for the grand final after defeating the Melbourne Storm 32-12 in their preliminary final at AAMI Park.\nMatch summary.\n1st half.\nAfter an even opening five minutes, the first points of the game were scored by the Brisbane side in the sixth minute, when a North Queensland handling error in midfield followed shortly by a penalty allowed Corey Parker to kick a 40-metre penalty goal. The Brisbane side then returned the first tackle after the restart for the opening try of the game, after a late offload on his own ten-metre line from Adam Blair to Anthony Milford allowed Milford to set up a line-break down the left wing, culminating in a try to Corey Oates; Parker converted the try and Brisbane led 8–0. The Broncos then knocked on shortly after the restart, and North Queensland scored its opening try from the ensuing scrum set piece, with Jake Granville breaking the line to set up Justin O'Neill for the try; Johnathan Thurston converted and Brisbane led 8–6. North Queensland nearly scored again three minutes later, with Oates making a try-saving tackle on Kyle Feldt after a pass from Lachlan Coote.\nOver the ensuing fifteen minutes, North Queensland had the better of possession and field position. In the 24th minute, attacking from a repeat set which had followed a grubber kick, James Tamou took the first pass out of dummy half and scored under the posts; Thurston converted the try to give North Queensland a 12–8 lead. Brisbane scored an opportunistic try in the 34th minute, when Thurston lost the ball in a tackle in North Queensland territory, and Matt Gillett recovered for Brisbane and broke the line to put Jack Reed over for a try; Jordan Kahu converted and Brisbane regained a 14–12 lead which it took to half time.\n2nd half.\nJordan Kahu kicked a penalty goal in the 43rd minute to extend Brisbane's lead to 16–12. From that point, the game played out as a defensive battle in Brisbane territory. North Queensland had the better of possession and field position, and generated several repeat sets in attack, but were unable to score due to a combination of poor execution and Brisbane's stout goal line defence. Brisbane actively sought to defend its lead, kicking for touch on the sixth tackle throughout most of the second half to wind down the clock and to slow the game down to manage fatigue. North Queensland's two closest opportunities came in the 61st minute, when Kane Linnett dropped a cut-out pass from Thurston which would have seen him score out wide; and in the 64th minute, when fullback Coote was tackled around the legs by Gillett just short of the try line – Coote reached out to put the ball over the line and was penalised for a double movement.\nWith four minutes remaining, and the ball deep in North Queensland's territory, Ben Hunt conceded a penalty for a dangerous lifting tackle on Linnett, giving North Queensland field position. North Queensland failed to score on the ensuing set; but on Brisbane's following set, Brisbane failed to get to a sixth tackle kick away, after Feldt stripped the ball one-on-one from Hunt at midfield on fourth tackle with one minute remaining. North Queensland attacked, and on the sixth tackle, after a couple of powerful runs from forwards Taumalolo, Tamou and Scott, Thurston received the ball on the left edge, beat a couple of tackles, looked left before floating a pass right to link up with his five-eighth Michael Morgan who ran diagonally right, cut in to draw three Brisbane defenders then as the full time siren sounded, 5 metres out flicked a short outside pass to winger Feldt who Oates left unmarked providing him the opportunity to score just inside the right corner post to level the match up at 16-16. Jonathon Thurston had a conversion attempt from the right touchline after full time to win the match. He took a long time to compose himself for the kick, however the ball failed to break enough to the left, hitting the right upright half way up and bouncing out, leaving the game tied up at 16–16 and heading into golden point extra time to break the deadlock.\nExtra time.\nNorth Queensland kicked off first in extra time, and the opening kick-off was knocked on by Ben Hunt, immediately giving North Queensland an attacking scrum on Brisbane's ten-metre line. North Queensland set up for the game-winning field goal, and after aborting attempts on the first and third tackles due to strong defensive pressure from the Broncos, Johnathan Thurston was able to make up for his missed conversion by slotting the field goal on the fourth tackle from 20 metres out to win the game 17–16. It was the first time an NRL Grand Final had been decided in Golden Point.\nPost-match.\nAt the post-match ceremony, Johnathan Thurston received the Clive Churchill medal as best on ground. This was then followed by the championship ring ceremony and the co-captains holding the Provan-Summons trophy.\nThurston drew praise for his post-match conduct, notably consoling Ben Hunt. Many consider the image of Thurston hugging his daughter to be the 'best image' of the grand final.\nAftermath.\nMost commentators, analysts and fans rate the 2015 Grand Final as one of, if not the greatest ever played, ranking it alongside the 1989 decider.\nBoth grand finalists, North Queensland and Brisbane, as well as minor premiers the Sydney Roosters, qualified for the second World Club Series, played in the 2016 pre-season against clubs from the Super League."

        "text": "Oxhey Golf Club was a golf club located near Watford in Hertfordshire, England. The Harry Vardon designed 18-hole golf course was host to several important tournaments including the News of the World Match Play and the McVitie &amp; Price Tournament.\nHistory.\nOxhey Golf Club, located near Watford in Hertfordshire, was opened informally on 4 May 1912. The event was commemorated by a match between Harry Vardon, designer of the course, and Ted Ray, who had been appointed as the club's professional. The match was won by Ray, 4 and 2. Ray served as the club professional until 1940.\nFirst World War.\nA little more than two years after the course was opened for play, the First World War began on 28 July 1914 and the war had a detrimental effect on the club, causing 58 members to resign. Of that total were eight women members who also submitted their resignations. Five of the groundskeepers joined the army and still more volunteered but were not eligible for service. Nineteen of the caddies also answered the call for military duty. The club's steward joined the Royal Marine Pension Reserve and reported for duty at Gosport.\nBy 5 May 1916, the war had already taken a toll on Oxhey caddies and greenkeepers with 5 casualties: 2 killed, 2 wounded, 1 prisoner. Among the club members there were 9 casualties: 3 killed, 5 wounded, 1 prisoner. In May 1917, the course had fallen into disrepair due to a lack of groundskeepers. By then some 84 members were serving in the army or navy, and a groundsman had been killed and another was a prisoner of war.\nPoor course conditions.\nThe bunkers were suffering from the play of lambs and sheep who were also drinking water from the water boxes near the tees. A fire at the club had destroyed the caddie master's and professional's shed but the structures were quickly rebuilt. The winter of 1915–16 had been very cold and it was beneficial to the course. The deep freeze helped to drain the course in the spring of 1916. In the prior year there had been mud problems on the course since there had been a three-year stretch without frost, two of which were exceptionally wet.\nPost First World War history.\nA problem with worms on the course had erupted by May 1920 and getting rid of them had become a priority. The course was reported as being in a \"shocking condition\" as a result of five years of neglect of the greens and damage caused by grazing sheep. By this time the club's greenkeeper had returned to work at the course after the war but his physical condition was reported as \"badly damaged\". Hunters had been shooting grouse on the course but were ordered to cease.\nBy 1921, the condition of the course had been improved to the point that it was selected to host the 1921 McVitie &amp; Price Tournament. The English professional Abe Mitchell won the 1921 tournament by two strokes from Joe Kirkwood, Sr.\nClosure.\nIn 1944, plans were approved for Oxhey Place to be redeveloped as a \"cottage estate\". The golf club ceased to operate on 31 October 1946. The golf course continued to be operated by the local council until it was permanently closed on 31 March 1952, with plans to convert the course and clubhouse into playing fields and a community centre.\nOxhey Park Golf Club.\nIn 1991, a new 9-hole course was built, which opened as Oxhey Park Golf Club. It has since closed.\nMajor tournaments hosted.\nOxhey was scheduled to host the final stage of the News of the World Match Play in 1914, but the tournament was cancelled following the outbreak of World War I. The club also hosted the inaugural Vagliano Trophy in 1931."

He is the only sprint athlete to have won that many individual titles in an event. The second most successful is LaShawn Merritt – a two-time champion and the only other athlete to have won four medals. The most successful women are Marie-José Pérec, Cathy Freeman and Christine Ohuruogu, all of whom have won two world titles. Jeremy Wariner is the only other person to have won two titles, and also has three medals to his name.\nThe United States is comfortably the most successful nation in the discipline – American men have topped the podium ten times and taken 23 medals in total. American women also top the table with two golds among seven medals. Jamaica is the only other nation to have won more than one medal in the men's race, and has won eleven medals in total across the sexes. Great Britain has had two winners and two runners-up. Australia, France and Bahamas are the only other nations to have won multiple gold\nmedals.\nJerome Young is the only athlete to be stripped of a medal in the event, as he lost his 2003 gold medal due to a doping ban.\nDoping.\nAntonio Pettigrew, the 1991 champion, was the first have his results annulled due to doping, although this ban affected his finalist placings from 1997 to 2001 only. His fellow American Jerome Young became the first and thus far only 400 m athlete to be stripped of their world title. His ban covered his 2003 win, a 2001 semi-finalist placing, and a fourth-place finish in 1999.\nNatalya Sologub of Belarus became the first female 400 m runner to be disqualified from the championships, having originally been a 2001 semi-finalist. The 2003 sixth-place finish of Calvin Harrison was annulled for doping, as weer the semi-finalist runs of Amaka Ogoegbunam in 2009 and Antonina Yefremova in 2011."

        "text": "Mitchell Stephens (born February 5, 1997) is a Canadian professional ice hockey centre for the Laval Rocket of the American Hockey League (AHL) while under contract to the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected in the second round, 33rd overall, by the Tampa Bay Lightning in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft and won back-to-back Stanley Cups with the Lightning in 2020 and 2021. Stephens has also previously played for the Detroit Red Wings.\nJunior career.\nAmateur.\nStephens was born on February 5, 1997, in Peterborough, Ontario to parents Lee and Heather. Growing up in Peterborough, Stephens played in the Peterborough Minor Hockey Council's AAA Petes program before joining the Toronto Marlboros of the Greater Toronto Hockey League. While playing with the Minor Midget AAA Toronto Marlboros, Stephens helped lead the team to a Kraft Cup title and Scotiabank GTHL Playoffs championship during the 2012–13 season. He reached this achievement by recording 44 goals and 84 points in 58 regular-season games. As a result of his play, Stephens was drafted eighth overall by the Saginaw Spirit in the 2013 Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Priority Selection draft.\nMajor junior.\nHis outstanding play with Saginaw was recognized when he was chosen to skate as a member of Canada Ontario at the 2014 World U-17 Hockey Challenge. During the 2014–15 season, Stephens was chosen to skate at the 2015 CHL/NHL Top Prospects Game.\nIn his final season with Saginaw in 2015–16, Stephens made 43 appearances, tallying 22 goals and 19 assists, while being named team MVP. He missed a significant number of games due to a broken foot that season. Stephens returned to the OHL for the 2016–17 season. Stephens was named captain of the Spirit with alternates Kris Bennett, C.J. Garcia, and Keaton Middleton. He remained captain of the team until January 2017 when he was traded to the London Knights in exchange for various draft picks. At the time of the trade, Stephens scored 62 goals to rank 14th all-time in franchise history. However, Stephens played only 29 regular season games with the Knights and 14 playoff games before returning to the Crunch.\nProfessional career.\nTampa Bay Lightning.\nStephens was selected by the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League (NHL) in the second round (33rd overall) of the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. On April 4, 2016, Stephens penned a three-year entry-level contract with the Lightning and was sent to their American Hockey League (AHL) team, the Syracuse Crunch, on an amateur try-out contract. He subsequently made his professional debut with the Crunch on April 8, 2016. He finished the season with the Crunch, recording one goal in five games. In his first full season in the AHL with the Crunch, Stephens was selected to appear in the 2018 AHL All-Star Classic.\nOn December 9, 2019, Stephens made his NHL debut in a 5–1 Lightning loss to the visiting New York Islanders at Amalie Arena. On December 28, 2019, Stephens recorded his first career NHL goal in 5–4 Lightning win over the Montreal Canadiens. On August 3, 2020, Stephens skated in his first career NHL playoff game, recording his first career NHL playoff goal and point. As a result, he signed a two year contract extension to remain with the Lightning on October 7, 2020. Stephens saw limited playing time during the 2020–21 season due to injury, appearing in just seven games with the Lightning and four additional games with the Crunch. He won his second Stanley Cup with the Lightning at the end of the 2021 Stanley Cup playoffs.\nDetroit Red Wings.\nOn July 30, 2021, Stephens was traded to the Detroit Red Wings in exchange for a sixth-round pick in the 2022 NHL Entry Draft. While attending the Red Wings training camp, Stephens earned praise from coach Jeff Blashill for his skating ability and energy while projecting he would play on their fourth line. During the 2021–22 season, he skated in 27 games with the Red Wings, scoring six points. His season was interrupted by a lower-body injury that kept him out from November 13, 2021 to April 8, 2022.\nMontreal Canadiens.\nOn July 13, 2022, Stephens signed a one-year, two-way contract with the Montreal Canadiens. He spent the entire 2022–23 season with Montreal's AHL affiliate, the Laval Rocket, scoring 20 goals and 41 points in 68 games. He re-signed with Montreal on July 10, 2023 to a one-year, two-way contract. Stephens participated in the Canadiens' 2023 training camp, but was placed on waivers and after going unclaimed, was assigned to Laval to start the 2023–24 season. He was recalled by Montreal on December 1, 2023. He made his Canadiens debut in a 5–4 overtime loss to the Detroit Red Wings on December 2 playing on the fourth line with Jesse Ylönen and Joel Armia. He scored his first goal for the Canadiens in a 5–2 win over the Chicago Blackhawks on December 23.\nInternational play.\nStephens competed as a member of Canada Ontario at the 2014 World U-17 Hockey Challenge. He was also invited to compete with the Canada men's national under-18 ice hockey team at the 2014 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament where he helped Team Canada win gold. In April 2015, he captained the Canada men's national under-18 ice hockey team to a bronze medal as the 2015 IIHF World U18 Championships.\nPersonal life.\nHe is the cousin of Philadelphia Flyers winger Owen Tippett."

        "text": "In British rugby league, winning \nthe Treble currently refers to winning the Super League Grand Final, League Leaders' Shield, and Challenge Cup in the same season. Up until 1973 this was achieved by winning the Championship Final, finishing top of the league during the regular season, and winning the Challenge Cup. \nBetween 1973 and 1996, following the abolition of the Championship Final, the league leaders were declared season champions. In this era, the Premiership was the third trophy required for the treble. \nOnly six teams have completed the treble, and it has only been achieved three times during the Super League era. Wigan Warriors are the most successful team, winning the treble on 3 occasions.\nMen's Treble.\nBradford Bulls.\n2003.\nBradford Bulls became the first team of the Super League era to win the treble in 2003. They beat Leeds Rhinos 22-20 in the 2003 Challenge Cup Final, won the League Leaders' Shield at the end of the season (the first time the current trophy was awarded) and completed the treble by beating Wigan Warriors 25-12 in the 2003 Super League Grand Final.\nHuddersfield Giants.\n1912-13.\nHuddersfield Giants were the first team to complete the treble in the 1912-1913 season, beating Warrington Wolves 9-5 in the Challenge Cup final. They then went on to finish top of the league and win the Championship Final 29-2 beating Wigan.\n1914-15.\nHuddersfield won their second treble before going on to win All Four Cups in 1914-15, beating St. Helens 37-3 in the Challenge Cup final and then beating Leeds 35-2 in the Championship Final a few weeks after they finished top of the league.\nLeeds Rhinos.\n2015.\nLeeds won their only treble in 2015. They began by whitewashing Hull Kingston Rovers 50-0 in the biggest ever win in the Challenge Cup Final to claim back to back Cup wins for only the second time. They won the League Leader's Shield after beating Huddersfield Giants in the final match of Super League XX, with winger Ryan Hall scoring in the last second to win the match. They completed the treble after beating Wigan Warriors for the first time in a major final, winning 22-20 in the 2015 Super League Grand Final.\nSt Helens.\n1965-66.\nSt Helens won their first treble in 1966, beating Wigan 21-2 in the Challenge Cup, finishing top of the league and beating Halifax 35-12 in the Championship Final.\n2006.\nIn 2006 Saints become only the second team in the Super League era to win the treble, 40 years after winning their first. They beat Huddersfield 42-12 in the 2006 Challenge Cup final, went on to finish top of Super League and beat Hull FC, who were playing in their first Grand Final, 26-4 in the 2006 Super League Grand Final. The 2006 St Helens team became only the second rugby league team in history to win the BBC Sports Personality Team of the Year Award.\nSwinton Lions.\n1927-28.\nSwinton Lions won their only treble in 1927-28 before going on to win All Four Cups. They started by beating Warrington 5-3 in the Challenge Cup and beat Featherstone Rovers 11-0 in the Championship Final after they finished top of the league.\nWigan Warriors.\n1991-92.\nWigan Warriors won their first treble in the 1991-92 season, finishing top of the league, defeating Castleford 28-12 in the Challenge Cup final and beating St Helens 48-16 in the Premiership final.\n1993-94.\nWigan won their second treble in 1993-94, finishing top of the league, defeating Leeds 26-12 in the Challenge Cup final and beating Castleford 24-20 in the Premiership final.\n1994-95.\nWigan won the treble for a record third time in the 1994-95 season, finishing top of the league, beating Leeds 30-10 in the Challenge Cup final and beating Leeds 69-12 in the Premiership final.\nWomen's Treble.\nFeatherstone Rovers.\nFetherstone Rovers were the first women's team in British rugby league to achieve the treble in 2012 when they won the inaugural Challenge Cup, finished top of the Women's RLC Premier Division and won the Championship final.\nThatto Heath Crusaders / St Helens.\nThatto Heath Crusaders achieved the treble twice when they won all three trophies in 2013 and 2016. The team then won again under the new St Helens name in 2021.\nBradford Bulls.\nIn 2017, Bradford Bulls became the third team to complete the women's treble.\nIn France.\nSimilar to the UK, the treble in French rugby league is achieved by winning the primary league competition, the Elite One Championship (French Rugby League Championship before 2002), the primary cup competition, the Lord Derby Cup, in addition to being the league leader at the end of the regular season. The teams that have achieved this are as follows:\n\"NB:\" Treble information prior to 2002, the start of the Elite One Championship era, is unavailable.\nAustralia and the World Club Challenge.\nDue to the lack of a primary cup competition in the National Rugby League, Australian teams (and those from other countries associated with the league) are unable to win the treble, with the only major trophies traditionally available being that of the NRL Grand Final and Minor Premiership (equivalent of the League Leaders' Shield).\nSince 1976, teams from both major leagues (the Super League and NRL) have had the ability to win the World Club Challenge, a one match competition played by the winners of both leagues. Since the switch to the summer era, the World Club Challenge victory needed to win the four trophies occurs the season following the league victory.\n\"NB:\" Whists this is a quadruple of trophies, it is not commonly referred to a \"The Quadruple\" in British rugby league.\nWigan Warriors.\nWigan Warriors were the first to achieve a quadruple of trophies during the 1993-94 season. Following their treble victory they beat Brisbane Broncos 20–14 in the World Club Challenge.\nBradford Bulls.\nBradford Bulls became the second team to do so, and the first of the Super League era, winning the treble in 2003 before completing the quadruple by beating Penrith Panthers 22–4 in the following year's World Club Challenge.\nSt Helens.\nSt Helens became the most recent team win the quadruple. Following their treble victory in the 2006 season, they beat Brisbane Broncos 18–14 in the following year's World Club Challenge."

        "text": "The 100 metres at the World Championships in Athletics has been contested by both men and women since the inaugural edition in 1983. It is the second most prestigious 100 m title after the 100 metres at the Olympics. The competition format typically has two or three qualifying rounds leading to a final between eight athletes. Since 2011 a preliminary round has been held, where athletes who have not achieved the qualifying standard time compete to enter the first round proper.\nThe championship records for the event are 9.58 seconds for men, set by Usain Bolt in 2009, and 10.65 seconds for women, set by Sha'Carri Richardson in 2023. The men's world record has been broken or equalled at the competition three times: by Carl Lewis in 1987 and 1991, and by Usain Bolt in 2009. Ben Johnson beat Lewis in the 1987 final, but his win and record were subsequently rescinded after his admission to long-term steroid use. Lewis's mark, which equalled the standing record at the time, was never officially ratified by the IAAF as a world record. The women's world record has not yet been beaten at the championships.\nShelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce is the most successful athlete of the event as the only person, male or female to win five titles. Carl Lewis, Maurice Greene and Usain Bolt are the most successful male athletes of the event, having each won three titles. Justin Gatlin ties Fraser-Pryce the most medals with 5, 2 gold and 3 silver. \nMerlene Ottey and Carmelita Jeter are the only other athletes to have claimed four medals in the history of the World Championships event.\nThe United States is the most successful nation in the discipline, having won fifteen gold medals. Jamaica are a clear second with six gold medals. East Germany, with two, is the only other nation to have won multiple titles.\nDoping.\nCanada's Ben Johnson and Angella Taylor-Issajenko were both disqualified from the 1987 World Championships in Athletics for doping. Johnson was stripped of his 100 m gold, elevating Carl Lewis to world champion, while Taylor-Issajenko finished fifth in the women's 100 m final.\nAt the following edition in 1991, Irina Slyusar of the Soviet Union (a women's semi-finalist) was disqualified for doping. Eight years passed without incident in the 100 m before the double Nigerian doping disqualification of Innocent Asonze and Davidson Ezinwa in 1999.\nTim Montgomery became the 100 m second medalist to be disqualified, losing his silver medal from the 2001 World Championships in Athletics. From the same event, Marion Jones later lost her silver medal for doping infractions, becoming the first female medalist to be stripped of a 100 m medal. Venolyn Clarke and Kelli White (a women's finalist) were also disqualified that year. The results of Dwain Chambers and Montgomery, fourth and fifth in 2003, were removed for doping. Two women's medalists were stripped of their honours for doping Kelli White lost the world title while Zhanna Block had her bronze medal removed. Block's times from the 2005 edition were also annulled. These disqualifications were a result of the BALCO scandal, which included many 100 m runners.\nNo doping offences were recorded at the 2007 World Championships 100 metres, but bans shortly returned, with Ruqaya Al-Ghasra being banned from the 2009 edition and a female trio of Inna Eftimova, Semoy Hackett and Norjannah Hafiszah Jamaludin being disqualified in 2011. The 2013 World Championships saw one elimination in Masoud Azizi.\nAmong the men's world champions, only Donovan Bailey, Usain Bolt, Fred Kerley and Noah Lyles have not been implicated in doping during their careers; three-time champion Maurice Greene never failed a drug test, but admitted purchasing drugs on other athletes behalf.\nReferences.\n11.R S D Unnithan's kerala India's nobel prize work 2002–16;2016–20;2021-22-92:8092 ad Personal profiled DATAS at Guinness world records from online nobel org/www.mednobel.ki.se/www.olympics.org"

His signing bonus with the Rays for more than $7 million, the second largest signing bonus since constraints were placed on the draft in 2012, behind only Hunter Greene. The Rays announced that they intended for McKay to both hit and pitch in the minors. He was assigned to the Hudson Valley Renegades and spent the whole season there. In 36 games, he batted .232 with four home runs and 22 RBI along with pitching 20 innings, posting a 1.80 ERA with 21 strikeouts. In the 2017 \"MLB.com\" midseason prospect update, McKay ranked as the 3rd best prospect in the Tampa Bay Rays farm system (Brent Honeywell, Willy Adames) and the 23rd best prospect nationally.\nMcKay began the 2018 season with the Rays' Class A affiliate, the Bowling Green Hot Rods, and was subsequently promoted to the Advanced A Charlotte Stone Crabs, where he both pitched and played first base.

She found that she loved the physicality of the game and the social aspects of being part of a team, and started playing competitively in 2008. Her team mates called her \"whippet\" on account of her speed on the basketball court. She played for the Nottingham Coyotes in the National League and is classified as a 2.5 point player.\nIn 2009 Williams made her debut with Team Great Britain at the 2009 BT Paralympic World Cup in Manchester, and in 2010 was part of the team that came sixth at the World Championships in Birmingham – Britain's best ever performance. She was then part of the team that won silver at the U22 European Championships in Italy later that year. She won bronze at the European Championships in Nazareth in 2011 and Frankfurt in 2013, and at the U25 World Championship in St. Catharines, Canada in 2011. She made her Paralympic debut in front of a home crowd at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London.\nWhilst studying at University of Alabama, Williams was part of the university wheelchair basketball team, and participated in their successfully winning their fourth national championship in seven years in 2015, with a 58–52 win over the University of Illinois.\nIn 2015 she was co-captain (with Amy Conroy) of the U25 team at the 2015 Women's U25 Wheelchair Basketball World Championship in Beijing, winning gold. She then played with the senior team that defeated France to take bronze in the 2015 European Championship. In May 2016, she was named as part of the team for the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro. The British team produced its best ever performance at the Paralympics, making it all the way to the semi-finals, but lost to the semi-final to the United States, and then the bronze medal match to the Netherlands.\nDomestically, Williams presently plays as a member of the Loughborough Lightning women's wheelchair basketball team.\nPersonal life.\nWilliams is engaged to fellow wheelchair basketball player Robyn Love. They have a child together. She holds dual citizenship as an Irish national having inherited this from her mother's Irish citizenship."

        "text": "Lucius Kadeem Fox Jr. (born July 2, 1997) is a Bahamian professional baseball shortstop who is a free agent. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Washington Nationals.\nCareer.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nFox is from Nassau, Bahamas. He began playing baseball when he was seven years old, and moved to the United States at age 12 to continue his career. Fox attended American Heritage High School in Delray Beach, Florida. He moved back to the Bahamas in time to be declared an international free agent during the 2015 signing period. Fox signed with the San Francisco Giants, for a reported $6 million signing bonus. He spent his first professional season, in 2016, with the Augusta GreenJackets of the Single–A South Atlantic League, posting a .207 batting average and a .305 on-base percentage in 75 games played.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nOn August 1, 2016, the Giants traded Fox, Matt Duffy, and Michael Santos to the Tampa Bay Rays for Matt Moore. He did not play for the Rays after the trade due to a bone bruise on his foot sustained while playing for Augusta. Fox began the 2017 season with the Bowling Green Hot Rods of the Single–A Midwest League. He represented the World Team in the 2017 All-Star Futures Game. After batting .278 with two home runs, 27 runs batted in (RBIs), and 27 stolen bases in 77 games for Bowling Green, the Rays promoted Fox to the Charlotte Stone Crabs of the High–A Florida State League, where he finished the season, batting .235 with one home run and 12 RBIs in 30 games. In 2018, he played for both Charlotte and the Montgomery Biscuits of the Double–A Southern League, slashing .268/.351/.341 with three home runs, 39 RBIs, and 29 stolen bases in 116 total games between the two teams. \nHe split the 2019 season between Montgomery and the Durham Bulls, hitting a combined .221/.331/.327/.658 with 3 home runs, 34 RBI, and 39 stolen bases. On November 20, 2019, the Rays added Fox to their 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft. Fox did not play in a game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nKansas City Royals.\nOn August 27, 2020, the Rays traded Fox to the Kansas City Royals in exchange for Brett Phillips. On July 30, 2021, Fox was promoted to the major leagues for the first time, but did not appear in the Royals' game against the Toronto Blue Jays and was optioned back to the Triple-A Omaha Storm Chasers the next day.\nWashington Nationals.\nFox was claimed first by the Baltimore Orioles on November 19, 2021, and then the Washington Nationals when the Orioles attempted to pass him through waivers eleven days later on November 30. \nFox made the Nationals' Opening Day roster in 2022 and made his major league debut on April 10. In his debut game, he deployed a safety squeeze bunt to tie the game in the eighth inning, ultimately leading to a Nationals come-from-behind win. Fox recorded his first MLB hit on May 1, and was optioned to the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings on May 3. In 10 games for Washington, he went 2–for–25 (.080) with 2 RBI, 1 stolen base, and 1 walk. On December 13, Fox was designated for assignment by the Nationals. He cleared waivers and was sent outright to Triple–A Rochester on December 20.\nIn 2023, Fox played for the rookie–level Florida Complex League Nationals, High–A Wilmington Blue Rocks, Double–A Harrisburg Senators, and Triple–A Rochester. In 44 total games, he batted a combined .229/.306/.313 with 3 home runs and 10 RBI. On September 12, 2023, Fox was released by the Nationals organization.\nChicago White Sox.\nOn February 8, 2024, Fox signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox. He was released by the White Sox organization on March 28."

        "title": "1974 UCI Road World Championships – Men's road race",
        "text": "The Men's Individual Road Race of the 1974 UCI Road World Championships cycling event took place on August 25 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The route consisted of twenty-one laps around a circuit that contained two climbs within it, totaling to a length of . Belgian Eddy Merckx won the race, while French riders Raymond Poulidor and Mariano Martínez finished second and third, respectively. This was Merckx's third victory in the men's road race at the UCI Road World Championships, equaling the record. In addition, he also completed the Triple Crown of Cycling, which consists of winning two Grand Tour races and the men's road race at the UCI Road World Championships in a calendar year.\nThe day of racing was highlighted by two large solo efforts on the part of the French riders Francis Campaner and Bernard Thévenet. Campaner attacked during the race's second lap and rode solo until being joined in the tenth lap by Gerard Vianen. The two were caught in the twelfth circuit and shortly after their capture, Thévenet attacked on his own and rode on his own through most of the final lap. Merckx initiated a chase group during the seventeenth lap that managed to catch and pass Thévenet with seven kilometers remaining. The group then splintered into two groups of two, with Merckx and Poulidor riding into the finish together. Merckx took victory in the two-man sprint.\nRace route.\nThe route for the race consisted of 21 laps that totaled for of racing, with each lap being in length. Each circuit featured two climbs within it, including a cross of Mount Royal. The route for the race navigated through the Université de Montréal campus. Several sports writers deemed the route to be difficult. The race began at 9 AM local time.\nParticipants and race favorites.\nThe race began with 70 riders from fifteen different countries, of which eighteen managed to finish the race. Reigning champion, Felice Gimondi, started the race despite sustaining injuries from a fall in the Bernocchi Cup the week beforehand. The Belgian team featured the riders Eddy Merckx, Herman Van Springel, Freddy Maertens, Patrick Sercu, and Roger De Vlaeminck, which cycling author William Fotheringham believed to be one of the best Belgian teams to race at the World Championships. Gianni Pignata of \"La Stampa\" believed that the race would likely be won by an Italian or a Belgian rider, but stated that Dutchman Gerrie Knetemann and Spaniard Luis Ocaña were dark-horse candidates for the victory. In particular, young Italian Francesco Moser was expected to provide race favorite Merckx with \"stiff competition.\" \"De Telegraaf\" writer Charles Taylor believed that José Manuel Fuente would be the best Spanish candidate for victory since Ocaña had recently recovered from sickness and injuries from crashes in different races. Taylor stated that there was no serious Dutch contender that could challenge the favorite, Merckx.\nRace summary.\nThe whole starting \"peloton\" stayed intact for the first lap which took only 18' 36\" to complete. The first attack came from French rider Francis Campaner. He managed to earn a 37\" advantage as he finished the second circuit and he increased that lead to 1' 19\" at the conclusion of the third lap. Behind, the chasing group was led by Francesco Moser, Eddy Merckx, and Felice Gimondi. After the fourth lap, Campaner had gained thirty more seconds on the \"peloton\". The gap between Campaner and the main field reached its maximum after the fifth lap — at 2' 21\" — and was reduced to 1' 36\" with the finishing of the sixth circuit.\nThe seventh lap saw a speed drop by the leading rider and the chasing \"peloton\", allowing Campaner's advantage to increase back to 2' 21\". The next two laps saw the gap fluctuate a little as the margin stayed around the two-minute mark. During the eleventh lap, Dutch rider Gerard Vianen attacked and managed to get within fifteen seconds of Campaner as the tenth lap ended, with the \"peloton\" 1' 27\" behind. Vianen joined Campaner during the eleventh circuit as Merckx attacked from behind, along with Gerrie Knetemann. During the twelfth circuit, Vianen and Campaner were caught. Shortly after the re-absorption of the duo back into the \"peloton\", Bernard Thévenet attacked and established a 40\" advantage. Campaner retired from the race in the kilometers following being caught, while Vianen retired during the thirteenth lap.\nTino Conti and Freddy Maertens attacked on the thirteenth lap and managed to get a time gap of 25\" on the \"peloton\", but still trailed Thévenet by 1' 10\" at the conclusion of the lap. Through the fifteenth lap, the duo was able to obtain over a minute lead on the \"peloton\"; however, Thévenet was still increasing his advantage over the race as a whole, with his lead reaching three minutes over the \"peloton\". The field began to increase its tempo in the sixteenth lap and close the gap to the Conti-Maertens group, which prompted Maertens to wait up for the \"peloton\", while Conti rode solo. On the seventeenth lap, a chase group with many race contenders – including Raymond Poulidor, Francesco Moser, Eddy Merckx, Maertens, and Herman Van Springel – formed and caught Conti. By the completion of the nineteenth lap, the chase group had shrunked to nine riders and Thévenet's lead had dropped to 2' 05\". Gimondi dropped out of the race the same lap.\nThe penultimate circuit saw the chase group, led by Merckx, shrink to five members and Thévenet's lead dwindle to 35\". The riders that remained in the chase group were Van Springel, Poulidor, Mariano Martínez, Merckx, and Giacinto Santambrogio. Van Springel was dropped by the Merckx group before Thévenet was caught and passed on the final climb of Mount Royal, with around remaining. The chase group led by Merckx broke into two groups of two, with Poulidor and Merckx riding together and Martinez and Santambrogio behind, together. The split was caused by a move made by Merckx with close to left. With two hundred meters remaining in the race, Merckx attacked and managed to open up a two-second gap between himself and Poulidor as he crossed the finish line to win the race.\nAftermath.\nWith his victory in the race, Eddy Merckx became the first rider to achieve the Triple Crown of Cycling, which consists of winning two Grand Tour races and the men's road race at the UCI Road World Championships in a calendar year. Merckx had already won the Giro d'Italia and the Tour de France, both of which are Grand Tours, before the World Championships and winning the men's road race allowed him to complete the Triple Crown. This feat has since been matched by only one rider, Stephen Roche, who managed to complete the Triple Crown in the 1987 season. This was also Merckx's third world title, which made him the third rider to ever be world champion three times, after Alfredo Binda and Rik Van Steenbergen. This was Merckx's final world championship victory and also the last season that he won a Grand Tour. On February 22, 1975, Merckx gave the bike that he used during the race to Pope Paul VI while visiting Vatican City.\nFollowing the victory, Merckx told the press that he felt lucky that Bernard Thévenet was weakened from his efforts on the road. In regards to his sprint against Raymond Poulidor, Merckx stated that he feared only an external setback because \"In the sprint [he] could not lose. Despite Thévenet missing out on a medal, Raymond Poulidor stated that the French were content with the results and worked great together. Reflecting on the race, \"De Telegraaf\" writer Charles Taylor stated he felt this race was \"one of the finest and most sensational bicycle races in recent years.\" Taylor noted a poor showing by the Dutch riders, citing that only two managed to finish the race. Taylor believed that the Dutch participants competed in too many criteriums between the end of the Tour de France and the start of the World Championships, which led to them not having fresh enough legs for the race. \"De Telegraaf\" also reported that there were over a 100,000 spectators for the men's road race. Francesco Moser was found to have had a disappointing performance as he placed seventh on the day, in part because he was suffering from a leg cramp."

England, France, Australia and New Zealand have hosted the World Cup on multiple occasions and the tournament has never been played outside its traditional 'heartlands' in these areas. The International Rugby League is responsible for picking hosts.\nFrom 1954 to 1960 the world cup was held triennially, however from 1960 to 2008 World Cups were sporadic. In this time period hosts were picked and tournaments were arranged between the four traditional rugby league playing countries and the IRL. From 2013 World Cups were held quadrennially and countries have to send an application and bids to the IRL to host the World Cup as more teams participate in international rugby league.\nList of hosts.\nMen's.\n\"NB\": As Great Britain was the IRL nation until 1995, the United Kingdom is used to refer to host nations before this time regardless of the number of home nations which actually hosted the tournament.\nWomen's.\n\"NB\": As Great Britain was the IRL nation until 2003, the United Kingdom is used to refer to host nations before this time regardless of the number of home nations which actually hosted the tournament.\nCombined bids (2013–2026).\n2013.\nBids:\nAustralia bid for the 2013 World Cup following their success of hosting the 2008 World Cup.

Australia also bid for the hosting rights again but with the help of New Zealand to co host. The RLIF accepted Australia and New Zealand's bid to host the 2017 World Cup as there would be more chance of the tournament being a success although South Africa was praised for their growing domestic game.\nWinners: / / \n\"NB\": The wheelchair tournament was held in \n2021 (Held in 2022).\nBids:\nWithdrawn bids\nOn 15 April 2015, the UAE expressed interest in biding for the World Cup with a formal bid being later materialised. The UAERL believed the country has the facilities, as well as the financial backing and infrastructure to host the World Cup. The bid was later cancelled after rugby union officials in the UAE had the leader of the bid arrested for \"managing a sporting body which is not registered and therefore not recognised by the relevant government authority\".\nOn 25 November 2015 England's RFL announced it had government backed plans to host the 2021 World Cup after the success of 2013. The RFL put in an official bid for the 2021 World Cup on 30 June 2016 with £15m funding from the government and the aim to have over 1 million spectators. The USARL put a bid in with the hope to grow the sport throughout North America.\nWinners: \n2025 moved to 2026.\nBids\nExpressed interest in biding\nWithdrawn following successful bid\nThe 2025 World Cup was recommended by the IRL to be hosted in the USA and Canada with their bid later being awarded.

However in May 2023, France withdrew due to financial concerns from the new French government elected that month.\nFollowing France's withdrawal, Fiji, New Zealand, Qatar, and South Africa expressed interest in bidding. In August 2023, the IRL confirmed that a Southern Hemisphere nation(s) would host the tournament in 2026.\nFollowing public interest surrounding the Qatar bid, the IRL confirmed it was not an official bid and also confirmed that the IRL did not see Qatar as a feasible option for hosting an international tournament at present, but would be open to them hosting in the future. They also confirmed interest from other Middle Eastern nations.\nWinners: / (later withdrew), (later withdrew)\nMen's bids (2030–).\n2030.\nExpressed interest in biding:\nFollowing the end of the 2023 season it was confirmed seven nations had expressed interest in bidding for the World Cup.

However with the tournament now being held in 2030 it is unknown if they will still make the bids.

        "title": "Sodus Bay Heights Golf Club",
        "text": "Sodus Bay Heights Golf Club, located in Sodus Point, New York, is a 150-acre (.60 km2) 18-hole golf course, overlooking Sodus Bay, the largest bay on Lake Ontario. Founded in 1924, the course plays 6,682 yards from the championship tees, 6,316 from the men's tees, and 5,470 from the ladies. The club started out as a 9-hole course, consisting of a club house, a separate pro shop, and a small caddy building. Before being turned into a golf club, the land was known as the Blackmar Farm, owned by Countess VerHemert of Paris, France. After her death, the buyers had grandiose plans for the property, and wanted to turn it into a recreation and housing tract. The original plans were to include a natural amphitheater, similar to the Hollywood Bowl, at the bottom of the knoll on the property, with a golf course running clockwise around it. Additional plans included a playground for the children and a tennis court. The golf course materialized first, and the tennis courts were added at a later date. The architect of the original 9-hole course is unknown, and rumors that famous golf architect Robert Trent Jones Sr. was the architect are incorrect. However, Robert Trent Jones was the first head golf professional at Sodus Bay Heights from 1930 to 1935, which has led to the confusion on his involvement with the course architecture.\nIn 1966, member Claude Wright, along with Head Golf Professional Lee Boice and Superintendent Warner Featherly, formed a committee to start planning an extension of 9 holes to make it a full 18-hole course. Geoffrey S. Cornish, a golf course architect from Amherst, Massachusetts, was given a contract to redesign the existing course, and to expand it another 9 holes. On Sunday, May 25, 1969, the new course was dedicated, and a commemorative stone was placed by the club flagpole. A number of golf pros were invited to play that rainy day. They were accompanied by two playing members, and were driven around by female club members.\nRobert Trent Jones Sr. and Jr. Legacy.\nRobert Trent Jones Sr. moved to the United States of America with his family at the age of 5, and they settled into East Rochester, New York. In his teens, Jones became an avid golfer, and ended up being the first Head Golf Professional at Sodus Bay Heights Golf Club. After heading the position for 5 years, Jones left to enroll in Cornell University, with the sponsorship of the club president, James D. Bashford. Though Jones did not graduate, since he did not meet the entrance requirements, the university allowed him to design his own course of study, essentially creating the world's first golf course architecture degree. In the spring of 2014, The Heights restaurant dining room, at Sodus Bay Heights Golf Club, was renamed in his honor, now officially called the Robert Trent Jones Sr. Grill and Tap Room.\nIn May 2014, Robert Trent Jones Jr. was invited to be a guest for the dedication of the newly minted Robert Trent Jones Sr. Grill and Tap room, and was scheduled to participate in the yearly Reserve Cup tournament being held that weekend. The tournament ended up being cancelled due to rainy weather, and Jones Jr. was unable to play the course. However, Mr. Jones was given a tour of the course and when he reached the 9th green, he dropped a ball, hit a putt, and said \"this isn't fair, it's too severe.\" He asked how the members felt about it, and after hearing that the members were not a fan of the green, said \"I'd be willing to redesign this in my father's name as a gesture of his legacy at no cost.\" Within an hour, Mr. Jones had sketched out a new design for the 9th green. Mr. Jones returned one year later, on May 16 for the 2015 Reserve Cup tournament that was present for the dedication of the \"New 9th Green\", and hit the first three ceremonial putts. About Mr. Jones Jr, Mr. David B. Jones, the head golf professional at Sodus Bay (no relation), stated:\"To have one of the leading golf course architects historically speaking, not just of recent times... to relish his history, his family tradition here and be willing to come to Sodus Point, New York not only to design the green, but to come open the green--two separate trips. It shows how important this is to him.\"\nHead professionals.\nThroughout the history of the 90+ year old club, there has been 8 different head professionals."

During the 1980s and 1990s, the CBL served as a means of promotion and relegation between the National Basketball League (NBL). By the 2000s, it served as a means for associations to enter representative teams into a national division two competition. The CBL also served as a feeder league for development or academy squads of NBL teams.\nHistory.\nThe Conference Basketball League (CBL) ran every year between 1981 and 2008, and consisted of multiple conferences throughout its lifetime, including northern, capital, central, and southern. From seven teams in 1996, the CBL grew to 25 teams spread over four conferences in 1999. The challenges facing the league by the late 2000s were similar to the national women's league, namely finding a format that teams could economically support. Basketball New Zealand chose not to host the CBL in 2009, before bringing it back in a one-off, five-day tournament in 2010.\nCBL Zone 1.\nIn 2009, North Harbour Basketball Association took on the responsibility of hosting the Conference Basketball League in the Auckland Region. The competition was predominantly run on the North Shore and was a zone 1 competition. The league was rebranded as the Supercity Basketball Competition in 2010, and then as the Senior Intercity Competition in 2011 and 2012, although it was still colloquially known during this time as the Conference Basketball League."

They beat hosts and defending champions Denmark by two points, while Poland edged out Australia to claim third.\nSweden were led to success by captain Andreas Jonsson and the returning Fredrik Lindgren, while Antonio Lindbäck and Linus Sundström also contributed vital points. With just two heats remaining it looked likely that Denmark would retain their title as they held a four-point lead over the Swedes. Kenneth Bjerre suffered an engine failure in heat 19 though, while Lindgren went on to win the heat and reduce the gap to a single point.

Yaylagul Ramazanova was subsequently called up as the team's third member just three days before the beginning of the competition.\nOn 18 June, the day before the beginning of the elimination rounds, the Dutch Olympic Committee announced that Shireen-Zoë de Vries was to return to the Netherlands due to from illness and would take no further part in the competition. The following day Kosovoan archer Lirije Sahiti also withdrew from the opening elimination round after falling ill.

        "title": "Scotland B national rugby union team",
        "text": "The Scotland national B rugby union team was one of several national rugby union teams behind the Scottish national side. It was largely used as a development side and began in the era when Scotland had little in the way of an age-grade pathway.\nIt has now been disbanded - having been supplanted by the age-grade national teams; and the Scotland 'A' side. However the 'B' side was not the same as the 'A' side; and for a period between 1990 and 1992 Scotland ran both 'A' and 'B' international sides. Players such as Cameron Glasgow and Ian Jardine have 'A' and 'B' caps.\nHistory.\nThe first Scotland 'B' match took place against France 'B' on 13 November 1971 and those continued throughout the 'B' side's history; and later more opposition arrived in the shape of Ireland 'B' and Italy 'B'. Scotland 'B' matches were Scotland's first attempt to be a development pathway for age-grade players; the Scotland Under 21 side played its first match in 1984. A 'B' cap was seen as a stepping stone to a full cap. After 1984, although losing its age-grade rationale, the Scotland 'B' side continued to run as a development side alongside the Under 21 and later age-grade sides; and was still seen as a stepping stone to a full cap.\nNo fully capped players were eligible for selection to the 'B' side.\nThe introduction of a Scotland 'A' side in 1990 [first played against Spain], alongside the age-grade pathway sides, meant that the remaining rationale of a 'B' side dwindled. The 'A' side was used as an official 'capture' side for securing residency or otherwise qualified players for Scotland's international selection, further increasing its usefulness.\nThe last Scotland 'B' international match took place in 1992. Again, it was against France 'B'.\nIn a weird twist, Scotland was to later field a Scotland Development XV between 1995 and 2002; indicating that the need for a development team outwith the 'A' side and age-grade sides remained necessary. However this Development XV side was not nominated a Scotland 'B' side.\nSelected teams.\nFirst match.\nThe first Scotland 'B' match was against France 'B' on 13 November 1971 at Oyonnax, near the France - Switzerland border. Frances 'B' had already beat Wales 'B' 30 - 9. The Scots fared slightly better but were still beaten 23 - 9.\nDixon's run of success.\nThe B team played on 18 February 1989 against France B.\nThe squad was:\nM Wright (Kelso); D A Stark (Ayr), B Edwards (Boroughmuir), R R W Maclean (Gloucester), W L Renwick (London Scottish); D K Shiel (Jed-Forest), J M Scott (Stewart's Melville FP); D F Milne (Heriot's FP), J A Hay (Hawick), P H Wright (Borougmuir), D S Munro (Glasgow High Kelvinside), J F Richardson (Edinburgh Academicals), G E A Buchanan-Smith, C B S Richardson, captain, (both London Scottish), K P Rafferty (Heriot's FP). Replacements—I J Ramsey (Melrose), T J Exeter (London Scottish), S Jardine (South Glamorgan Institute), R I Wainwright (Edinburgh Academicals), D J D Buthcer (London Scottish), J G Runciman (Melrose).\nIt was coached then by Richie Dixon, at the time the coach of the Glasgow District side. It was reported in 1988 that Dixon had won Scotland B 5 out of their last 6 matches, including 2 France B matches\nLast match.\nThe last Scotland 'B' match to play [against France 'B'] saw these sides below face one another on 3 February 1992. Graham Young was the selector of the Scotland 'B' squad. Hugh Campbell was the forwards coach. Guy Laporte was the head coach of France 'B'.\nFRANCE ■ S. Ougler, P. Salles. M Marsaing, H.

Pearcy (England).\nFrance won the match 27 - 18.\nUnlucky 'B' caps.\nSeveral 'B' caps for Scotland were unlucky - whether through injury, illness, or just in an era where a more dominant player played in their position - not to go on a receive a full senior cap."
