Because the game was understaffed for designers, Suzuki actually contributed some of the drawings for the various punching animations.\nAccording to Suzuki, the game was developed for the SG-1000 first, and then the arcade version was created by simply installing an SG-1000 in an arcade cabinet.\n\"Pengo\" makes a cameo after a KO."

        "text": "Thomas Iain Abercrombie (born 5 July 1987) is a New Zealand former professional basketball player who played 16 seasons in the Australian National Basketball League (NBL) for the New Zealand Breakers. A product of Westlake Boys High School in Auckland, Abercrombie had a short-lived college basketball stint with Washington State before debuting in the Australian NBL in 2008 with the Breakers. In 2011, he won his first NBL championship and earned Grand Final MVP honours. He went on to win three more championships in 2012, 2013 and 2015. He ended his NBL career in 2024 as the Breakers' most-capped player with 429 games.\nAbercrombie also played four seasons in the New Zealand NBL and had stints abroad in France, Spain and Turkey.\nEarly life and junior career.\nBorn and raised in Auckland, New Zealand, Abercrombie attended Westlake Boys High School and played four years of school basketball. In 2005, he captained the basketball team to the title at the Secondary School National Championships. That year, he also served as the school's deputy head boy and was captain of the volleyball team.\nAs a junior, Abercrombie played for the North Harbour Basketball Association and represented New Zealand with the Junior Tall Blacks.\nIn November 2005, Abercrombie accepted a scholarship deal with Washington State University. He spent two seasons with the Cougars, redshirting his freshman season in 2006–07 before seeing action in 12 games in 2007–08. On 14 May 2008, Abercrombie was granted a release from the team to pursue his basketball career in New Zealand.\nProfessional career.\nNew Zealand Breakers.\nAfter returning home following his college stint, Abercrombie joined the New Zealand Breakers in the Australian NBL as a development player for the 2008–09 season. He played 13 games in his first season with the Breakers, and was elevated to the full squad for the 2009–10 season. He missed four games in the back half of the season with an ankle injury.\nIn the 2010–11 season, Abercrombie helped the Breakers reach their first ever grand final series, where they defeated the Cairns Taipans 2–1 to win their maiden NBL championship. He was subsequently named the Grand Final MVP. Abercrombie went on to win three more championships with the Breakers in 2012, 2013 and 2015.\nIn January 2016, Abercrombie passed Kirk Penney as the club's all-time leading scorer. Due to Penney's return to the club for two seasons, Abercrombie had to pass him again in October 2018 to reach 3227 points in 276 games. In February 2019, he played his 300th NBL game.\nIn October 2019, Abercrombie committed to the Breakers until the end of the 2021–22 season.\nIn 2019–20, Abercrombie became the second player in NBL history (after Daniel Kickert in 2016–17 and 2017–18) to join the exclusive 50–40–90 club. Abercrombie averaged 12.1 points per game for the season while shooting 50.0 percent from the field, 46.5 percent from three-point range and 90.5 percent from the free throw line.\nIn April 2021, Abercrombie played his 355th game for the Breakers, surpassing Mika Vukona (354) to become the franchise's all-time games played leader. He also passed Kirk Penney (489) as the club's all-time leader in 3-pointers made.\nAbercrombie missed most of the 2021–22 NBL season with a side strain and missed the first month of the 2022–23 NBL season after suffering a torn retina which required emergency surgery.\nOn 10 May 2023, Abercrombie re-signed with the Breakers for the 2023–24 NBL season. In September 2023, he played his 400th NBL game.\nOn 13 February 2024, Abercrombie announced that the 2023–24 season would be his last in the NBL. He retired with 429 career games and finished as the Breakers' most-capped player.\nNew Zealand NBL.\nIn 2009, Abercrombie debuted in the New Zealand NBL with the Waikato Pistons. He helped the Pistons win the championship while claiming Rookie of the Year and All-Star Five honours. He continued on with the Pistons in 2010 and earned All-Star Five honours again while helping the Pistons make a second consecutive grand final appearance. He returned to the Pistons for a third season in 2011 and once again earned All-Star Five honours.\nIn 2019, Abercrombie played half a season with the Wellington Saints and helped them win a championship while claiming Grand Final MVP honours.\nOverseas stints.\nDuring the 2013 NBL off-season, Abercrombie took part in mini-camp opportunities with NBA teams such as the San Antonio Spurs, Milwaukee Bucks, Houston Rockets and Dallas Mavericks. He then joined the Phoenix Suns for the NBA Summer League.\nFollowing the 2013–14 NBL season, Abercrombie had a stint in France with ASVEL Basket. He went on to have similar post-NBL season stints the following three years, playing for Gipuzkoa Basket in Spain in 2015, and then having two stints in Turkey with Pınar Karşıyaka (2016) and Büyükçekmece Basketbol (2017).\nNational team career.\nAbercrombie made his debut for the Tall Blacks in 2006.

        "title": "Johnny Wright (baseball)",
        "text": "John Richard Wright (November 28, 1916 – May 4, 1990) was a Negro league pitcher who played briefly in the International League of baseball's minor leagues in 1946, and was on the roster of the Montreal Royals at the same time as Jackie Robinson, making him a plausible candidate to have broken the baseball color barrier. Instead, Wright was demoted from Montreal and returned the next season to the Negro leagues.\nNegro league experience.\nWright was a New Orleans-born, 5'11\", 175-lbs, right-handed pitcher who started his professional career with the New Orleans Zulus in 1936 at age 17. The Zulus were as much sports entertainment as a legitimate baseball team, in the mold of the Harlem Globetrotters of the era.\nPlaying in Louisville in 1937, Wright was picked up by the Newark Eagles of the Negro National League, a big league club. He also played for the Atlanta Black Crackers and Pittsburgh Crawfords in 1938, Toledo/Indianapolis Crawfords from 1939 to 1940 before joining the famed Homestead Grays in 1941.\nThe Grays of the era won a record nine consecutive pennants. The club, managed by Candy Jim Taylor, boasted some of the game's all-time greats: Cool Papa Bell, Josh Gibson, Buck Leonard, Howard Easterling, Sam Bankhead, Jud Wilson.\nThe club won its first Negro World Series in 1943 behind the pitching of Ray Brown, Roy Partlow and Wright. He became the third player ever in Negro league baseball history to achieve the pitching \"Triple Crown\" in leading a league in wins, ERA, and strikeouts. He did so by going 18-3 with a 2.54 ERA with 94 strikeouts in 181 innings pitched (30 games with 22 starts). He went 2-1 in the Negro World Series while appearing in five games (four starts), achieving two complete games with two shutouts in the series victory for the Grays.\nWright was known as a speedy pitcher with good control and a sharp curve. Opponents described Wright as throwing harder than Satchel Paige. \"Johnny was exceptional, as good as anyone we had,\" said George \"Tex\" Stephens, a longtime local observer of Negro leagues baseball who played against Wright as a youth. \"As good as Satchel Paige,\" Stephens said. \"Certainly faster (than Paige).\"\nAfter the 1943 season, Wright joined the U.S. Navy during World War II. While in the Navy he pitched for the Great Lakes Naval Station team, a black club.\nBy 1945, he was playing for the Brooklyn Naval Air Base team where he posted a 15–4 record and was said to have the best ERA in the armed forces. Also in early 1945, he pitched well in an exhibition game against the Brooklyn Dodgers. At the end of the season in 1945, Wright joined the Grays and pitched in three contests; winning them all. He also appeared in the Negro World Series.\nMinor League callup.\nIn late October 1945 Branch Rickey made the announcement of the Jackie Robinson signing. Rickey likewise announced the signing of Wright on January 29, 1946, making him the second officially recognized African-American to sign a contract with organized baseball during the integration era. In reality, Wright had likely signed months earlier. Two weeks after the Robinson announcement, the Negro leagues issued a protest to baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler claiming that Rickey was tampering with their players. Wright and Robinson were the named players. In fact, reports suggest that Wright actually signed a contract on November 20, 1945, with the Dodgers.\nSome speculated that Rickey merely wanted a compatriot for Robinson during his first spring in organized ball, a speculation that Clyde Sukeforth, Rickey's scout, agreed with: \"I don't think that the reports indicated that Johnny Wright was an outstanding pitcher, but apparently Mr. Rickey thought he would be an excellent companion [for Robinson].\" Other reports were more complimentary of Wright. Influential black sports writer Sam Lacy of the \"Baltimore Afro-American\" said: \"Wright doesn't boast the college background that is Jackie's, but he possesses something equally valuable – a level head and the knack of seeing things objectively. He is a realist in a role which demands divorce from sentimentality.\" Hall of Famer Monte Irvin, who played with and against Wright in the Negro leagues, feels strongly that Wright's curveball was of major-league quality. But, in his autobiography, \"Nice Guys Finish First,\" Irvin said Robinson had one advantage in spring training: Rachel, his wife, who accompanied her spouse to the South in what she knew would be a trial by fire. Wright, by contrast, although married with two children, was alone in Daytona Beach, where the Dodgers trained.\nOn March 4, 1946, in Sanford, Florida, Robinson donned his Montreal Royals uniform for the first day of spring training in the Dodgers' organization, joined by Wright. That day would not feature an official game. Wright would be on the active roster on March 17, 1946, when Robinson started at shortstop for the Royals in an exhibition game against their parent club the Dodgers, the first step in breaking baseball's color barrier.\nIn the spring, Wright had a bad outing as pitcher in an intrasquad game against the Dodgers, giving up 8 runs on 10 hits in five innings. In another intrasquad game, he walked four in four innings, giving up two runs on three hits. In his last appearance, he walked four and hit another in one inning.\nBoth Robinson and Wright landed with the AAA Montreal Royals of the International League when the season began. In his first appearance, against Syracuse, Wright entered in relief. He gave up 4 runs and 5 hits over 3.1 innings. The next time on the mound Wright pitched in Baltimore, the southernmost city in the International League, and a hostile environment for black players. He entered in the sixth inning behind by five. He retired the side and finished the game without giving up a hit. In general, however, during his six weeks with the club, he was used sporadically and often suffered from control problems. On May 14, he was demoted to the Class-C Trois Rivieres Royals of the Canadian-American League. The Dodgers immediately replaced Wright on the Montreal roster with Roy Partlow, another black pitcher, but Partlow's time with Montreal was limited and he was eventually reassigned to join Wright at Trois Rivieres.\nWright went 12–8 with Trois Rivieres, plus winning the deciding game of the championship series. At the end of the season, Wright would barnstorm with Robinson's \"All-Star\" squad.\nWright appears in only one paragraph of Robinson's autobiography:\nShortly after Branch Rickey had signed me for Montreal, he had signed John Wright, a black pitcher, for the farm club. Johnny was a good pitcher, but I feel he didn't have the right kind of temperament to make it with the International League in those days. He couldn't withstand the pressure of taking insult after insult without being able to retaliate. It affected his pitching that he had to keep his temper under control all the time. Later I was very sad because he didn't make the Montreal team.\nReturn to Negro leagues and retirement.\nWright rejoined the Grays for 1947, making the All-Star team and winning eight games. He retired after the 1948 season, returning to New Orleans. There, he worked for National Gypsum Company, rarely discussing his baseball days. \"I'm sure most of his co-workers at the gypsum plant never even knew he was a ballplayer,\" said Walter Wright (no relation), president of the Old-Timers Club who played and followed baseball for most of his 84 years. Wilmer Fields, a teammate with the Grays, said: \"John never talked much about his experience with the Dodgers. He was a happy-go-lucky person who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\" Wright died in 1990.\nExternal links.\n and Seamheads"

Allen Edwards added 15 points, Wayne Turner had 12 points and Heshimu Evans had 10 points. Four days later Kentucky traveled to island of Maui to compete in the annual Maui Invitational Tournament, Kentucky defeated George Washington 70 to 55 in the first round of the tournament. The victory over the Colonials set up a game the next night in the semifinals against No. 1 Arizona, a rematch of the 1997 NCAA tournament championship Game. Kentucky experienced its first loss of the season with a 74 to 89 set back. After the loss the Wildcats rebounded the next night in the 3rd-place game against Missouri with a 77 to 55 victory.

Kentucky finished the 1997 calendar year with a 11–2 record and ranked 6th in the AP poll.\nResults.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#005DAA; color:white;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#005DAA; color:white;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#005DAA; color:white;\"| SEC Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"text-align: center; background:#005DAA\"|NCAA tournament"

He was the first round selection of the Seattle Mariners in the 1983 Major League Baseball Draft, two selections ahead of Roger Clemens.\nBell was originally drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the sixth round of the 1980 Major League Baseball Draft as a senior at Fairmont East High School in Kettering, Ohio, but opted to attend Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia instead. While attending Old Dominion, he participated in the 1982 Amateur World Series and the Pan American Games. When the Monarchs won the Sun Belt East Division Championship in 1983, he was named a \"Sporting News\" All-American and the Sun Belt Conference MVP.\nBell was considered the top defensive catcher in the draft when the Mariners selected Bell with the seventeenth overall pick in 1983. However, he batted just .176 in his first professional season for the Midwest League's Wausau Timbers, and displayed very little power. In three seasons in the Mariners' organization, he batted .233 with two home runs and 64 runs batted in. On May 21, , he was dealt to the Kansas City Royals for relief pitcher Mark Huismann.\nWith the Royals, Bell received a September call-up in 1986. He appeared in eight games, and went hitless in five plate appearances with two walks. On September 3, , after spending the entire season in the minors with the Memphis Chicks, he was the player to be named later in a mid-season deal with the Atlanta Braves for reliever Gene Garber. He appeared in one game for the Braves, and struck out pinch hitting for Ed Olwine.\nHe continued to play minor league ball for the Braves through . In seven minor league seasons, he batted .231 with eight home runs and 136 RBIs."

        "title": "Rugby league playing field",
        "text": "The rugby league playing field, also referred to as a pitch or paddock, is the playing surface for the sport of rugby league football and is surfaced exclusively with grass.\nThe dimensions and markings of a full-sized playing area are defined in Section 1 of the \"Laws of the Game\". These Laws are the agreed upon and maintained by the Rugby League International Federation. The playing field is defined as \"the area bounded by, but not including, the touch lines and dead ball lines\" by Section 2. If the ball or any player in possession of it makes contact with the touch lines or dead ball lines or the ground beyond them it is deemed to be out of play.\nThe rugby league field also has markings to denote where restarts, such as scrums, should be placed.\nDimensions.\nA rugby league pitch (or field) is wide and long. The try lines (or goal lines) stand apart. On each one is a goal post that is wide and at least high, with a crossbar set above the ground. The distance from try line to dead-ball line is .\nThe field of play is a fixed size – long and wide and does not include the line markings, meaning all touchlines and dead ball lines are considered out of play.\nField.\nNear each end of the field is a \"goal line\", or try-line; they are apart. A scoring area called the \"in-goal area\" extends from each try-line to each dead ball line.\nMost play will occur within the \"field of play\", this \"is the area bounded by, but not including, the touch lines and goal lines\".\nWhen the team in possession of the ball is attempting to score a try, the goal line is included in the in-goal area, grounding the ball correctly on either is a try.\nWhen the team in possession is attempting to return the ball to the field of play from their own in-goal area the goal line is part of the field of play. A team caught with the ball in their own in-goal must restart play with a drop kick of the ball from between their posts, this usually results in the other team gaining possession.\nBetween the goal lines, broken lines run parallel to each touch line at from touch. Free kicks are taken in from the point where the ball entered touch after being kicked out to gain ground from a penalty. If a scrum is required to restart play and the event that caused it occurred \"within 20 metres of a touch line or ten metres of a goal line the scrum shall be brought in twenty metres from the touch line and ten metres from the goal line\".\nMarkings.\nLines with distance markers transverse the field every perpendicular to the touch lines. The distances ascend from each goal line towards the halfway line, which is marked \"50\" (similar to a typical American football field). These lines, as well as the goal lines, dead ball lines and touch lines are wide and white in colour, the only exception being the lines, which are usually coloured red to distinguish them for the determination of 40–20 kicks in play.\nThe broken lines and in from the touch lines are wide and white in colour.\nThe distance markers on the playing field are white with a red outline. These numbers are .\nObjects.\nOn each goal line are two goal posts apart connected by a cross bar from the ground. Each goal post is in height (however they can be built higher) and for the purpose of judging a goal are considered to extend upwards indefinitely. The posts and crossbar form an \"H\" shape. Goal posts supported by only one post below the crossbar are permissible. The bottom of a goal post is recommended to be padded to protect players from injury. At professional level, these pads are usually cuboids that encase each post.\nA corner post is placed at the points where each touch line meets each goal line. The post must consist of non-rigid material and should be at least in height. The corner posts are \"in touch in-goal\", that is to say they act in the same way as sidelines and the ball-carrier touching them immediately halts play.\nRule variation.\nDuring the 2010 NRL season, a rule change to the playing field was implemented so that if a player in possession of the ball made contact with the corner post that player would no longer be considered to be touch in-goal. Proponents of the move argued a series a possible future scenarios made this preventative measure necessary, with ARL chief executive Geoff Carr stating, \"no one has thought of the possibility of using the corner post as a weapon to defuse a try and we want to stop it before they do\". One scenario was that a defending player might manipulate the corner post to put an attacker out of play. Another concern cited was that the corner post might be made to make contact with a rolling ball to ensure the defending team gains possession with a 20-metre restart. Corner posts, which sometimes lean to one side, have no upper height limit set and this led to a fear that corner posts might become \"long rubber snakes, biting attackers and sending them into touch\", in the words of Roy Masters. Other laws concerning the corner posts remained unchanged. A ball that makes contact with the corner post while not in the possession of a player will be deemed to be touch in-goal as before. There was no attempt to remove the corner posts from the playing field as they are used to promote sponsors and are also a useful aid for players to judge their kicks. The change was agreed by the NRL Board and approved by the RLIF as an experimental rule. Implementation occurred mid-season following feedback from clubs."

From there they increased the size of the hull, and the new class was introduced into Victoria through the Hobsons Bay Yacht Club. Subsequently, the class traveled to South Australia in the 1950s and was employed as one of four recognised classes that were being raced at the Brighton &amp; Seacliff Yacht Club. Today the Brighton &amp; Seacliff Yacht Club is the only place in Australia where regular races are still held.\nThe canoe was based on Uffa Fox's Brynhild design, and possesses a sleek hull with two hiking planks."

        "title": "2009 Challenge Cup final",
        "text": "The 2009 Carnegie Challenge Cup Final was played on 29 August 2009 at Wembley Stadium, in London between Huddersfield Giants and Warrington Wolves. It was the first Challenge Cup final since 1985–86 that any of the 'Big Four' (Bradford, Leeds, St. Helens, and Wigan) had failed to reach. It was the second final in four years for Huddersfield following their appearance in the 2006 final, but their first appearance at Wembley Stadium in forty-seven years.\nEn route to the final, Warrington defeated Wigan 39–26 in their semi final at the Stobart Stadium Halton in Widnes on 8 August 2009, and on the day after Huddersfield beat holders St Helens 24–14 in Warrington's Halliwell Jones Stadium.\nRoute to final.\nDue to the way teams at different professional levels are introduced into the tournament, the number of rounds needed to reach a Challenge Cup final depends on the team, and the league they play in. For a Super League team to reach a final, they must have played four rounds. Five rounds must have been played for a team playing in the Co-operative Championship, and for an amateur or foreign club, the number varies depending on which round they entered the competition. Because both Warrington Wolves and Huddersfield Giants are Super League clubs, they both entered the competition in the fourth round, receiving byes in the third.\nWarrington Wolves.\nWarrington's cup-run started with a home tie to Championship One part-timers the York City Knights. Their last meeting in the Challenge cup in 2000 resulted in a near-whitewashing 84–1 defeat. Lee Briers replaced Michael Monaghan at while Hicks took over kicking duties, with Martin Gleeson left out over speculation of a move to Wigan Warriors, which eventually came true. Warrington scored first thanks to a try from Simon Grix in the second minute, but York struck back immediately afterwards to take the lead with an effort from ; Danny Ratcliffe. Vinnie Anderson and Ben Harrison both scored tries which were converted before sloppy defence allowed Paul Hughes to score an opportunist York try midway through the first half. Warrington took a half time lead of 28–10 thanks to Ben Westwood and the first try of the season for Michael Cooper. Warrington kept a clean sheet in the second half, as they doubled their first half tally. Tries from Chris Bridge, Lee Briers, Vinnie Anderson, Louis Anderson and Paul Johnson took the game away from York, a cause not helped by the sending off of ; Danny Ekis after 64 minutes The game finished 52–10, with Garreth Carvell returning from injury to pick up the man of the match award.\nTheir fifth round match was a fixture away at the Featherstone Rovers' Chris Moyles Stadium in which they again scored 56 points. The game was fullback Richard Mathers' debut for the Wolves following his transfer from the Wigan Warriors in exchange for Martin Gleeson. Rovers scored first thanks to Tommy Saxton on the wing, and threatened to score another, although an interception from Hicks was returned for a 70-metre try. Monoghan then set up Mathers in support who scored the away team's second try. A deflected kick picked up by Westwood provided another Warrington try for Monaghan. Although a knock-on from Chris Riley gave the Featherstone Rovers good field position, they failed to score, and Warrington extended the lead to 8–20 at half time thanks to a try from Paul Wood. Warrington scored first after the break following some tidy passing between Monoghan and Jon Clarke, with Hicks eventually scoring the try, before the Featherstone Rovers scored their second and last try of the match through Tom Haughey. A further Warrington try from Hicks, as well as a try worked by ex-Wigan pair Mickey Higham and Mathers were followed by tries from Harrison, Riley and Bridge to end the game comprehensively in Warrington's favour, with ten tries in total being scored by the away side.\nOn 30 May, Hull witnessed only the second ever Challenge Cup game to be decided by the golden point rule, as Hull Kingston Rovers proved a tougher outfit than both of Warrington's previous sub-Super League opponents. Hull Kingston Rovers started better, and seized the initiative after just three minutes, with Paul Cooke's long pass to Peter Fox proving an opportunity for Kris Welham. Despite multiple handling errors from Simon Grix, the home side failed to extend their lead. Two goal-line dropouts eventually lead to Vinnie Anderson crashing over the try-line on the 16th minute, in front of the post; Chris Bridge converted to level the scores 6–6, which it remained until half-time thanks to a last resort tackle from fullback Shaun Briscoe to deny Ben Harrison a try. Monaghan retreated from the match in the 31st minute, but Warrington took the lead at the start of the second half when Jon Clarke finished off a Matt King break on the wing. Hull Kingston Rovers replied with two tries of their own in five minutes, from Clint Newton, and later Ben Galea following a kick from Paul Cooke which deceived Richie Mathers. With the scores already 18–12, Rovers extended their lead further on the hour with a break that covered half the \"New\" Craven Park pitch from Jake Webster. Matt King plucked Lee Briers' kick into the corner for a Warrington try and Chris Bridge made the scores level with another try in the 70th minute. Bridge converted his own try to give Warrington a slender two-point lead before a penalty conceded for offside provided Michael Dobson with an opportunity to level the game again. A knock on from the resulting kick-off gave Lee Briers a chance to land a drop goal, but he sliced the ball, forcing the game into extra time. He missed two further chances, before kicking the ball between the uprights in front of the visiting Warrington fans in the 85th minute.\nThis victory set up a semi-final date with Wigan Warriors, the most successful team in the Challenge Cup's history, at the Stobart Stadium Halton in Widnes. Despite a third minute Ben Westwood try disallowed by video referee Phil Bentham for obstruction, Warrington again fell behind before replying strongly, with Phil Bailey returning from injury to give Wigan a 6–0 lead after seven minutes, before Pat Richards scored his 1000th Wigan career point with a penalty goal to extend the lead by a further two points. Bailey was soon withdrawn with an injury to his Achilles which ended his match day. Three tries came in quick succession as Warrington struck back, with Matt King bursting through four defenders, Louis Anderson taking advantage of a mistake from Amos Roberts, and Briers weaving through the defensive line to take the scores to 18–8 following three successful conversions from Chris Bridge. Although Andy Coley was held over the try-line, Wigan's attack on the Warrington line was otherwise dull, and further tries from Michael Cooper and Matt King put the game beyond the Warriors by half-time. Warrington scored first in the second half, with Matt King gathering the high ball from Lee Briers unopposed to complete his hat-trick. A spirited Wigan fightback followed thanks to Warrington handling errors in their own half, with Sam Tomkins gathering his own kick for a try in the 55th minute, Andy Coley scoring from a Paul Prescott offload, and Thomas Leuluai defeating Richie Mathers in a one-on-one tackle. Richards' perfect kicking game reduced the margin to just six points, before a Lee Briers drop goal from thirty metres out and a Chris Hicks try put the game once again beyond Wigan's reach.\nPre-match.\nThe cup final curtain raiser, a match contesting the Year 7 boys Champion Schools was between Outwood Grange College of Wakefield and Castleford High School.\nClassical soprano Hayley Westenra was the headline pre-match entertainment, performing the cup final anthem, \"Abide with Me\", and the British national anthem. Supporting Westenra were the Black Dyke Band and the ACM Gospel Choir.\nPlayers from the 1975 final, played by Warrington and Widnes and including Mike Nicholas, 'Big' Jim Mills and Doug Laughton, were re-united before kick-off.\nThe coaches for both teams were from the same part of New South Wales and had even played together for the St. George Dragons in their 1993 NSWRL season grand final loss to the Brisbane Broncos.\nThe BBC broadcasting team included commentators Dave Woods and Jonathan Davies, presenters Clare Balding, Robbie Paul, Damian Johnson and Tanya Arnold and experts Justin Morgan and Brian Noble, the coaches of Hull Kingston Rovers and Wigan Warriors respectively.\nMatch.\nFirst half.\nWarrington kicked off and after the game's first set of six tackles, Brett Hodgson's clearing kick was charged down by Louis Anderson who re-gathered and was tackled close to Huddersfield's try-line. Moments later, in only the second minute of the game, Richie Mathers from close range barged over between the uprights and the video referee ruled that a Huddersfield hand had not prevented him from grounding the ball on the line. Chris Bridge's straightforward conversion put the Wolves ahead 6–nil. Just on the seven-minute mark, after repeat sets attacking Warrington's line, Huddersfield's Shaun Lunt appeared to have scored a similar try, forcing his way to the line beneath the uprights to put the ball down, although it was controversially denied by the video referee, who ruled a double movement. However, in the 9th minute, the Giants were working the ball out of their own half when David Faiumu offloaded from a tackle to a flying Brett Hodgson who then drew the fullback in and passed to Lunt who outran the defence to score. Hodgson successfully kicked the extras so the scores were level at 6 all. Only about two minutes later Warrington replied with another close-range try, this time from Michael Monaghan running from dummy half and stretching out from the tackle to put the ball down. Bridge made no mistake with the conversion so the Wolves' lead was 12–6. Then in the fifteenth minute Warrington scored again, moving the ball out to the right to Chris Hicks' wing where he crossed, improving the field position for his kicker before putting the ball down. Bridges kicked the goal, pushing the Wolves' lead out to 18–6, with less than a quarter of the match played. Shortly after, Warrington appeared to have scored again when Matt King leapt for a Lee Briers bomb and came down with the ball over the line. However the video referee ruled that he'd taken the ball from a Huddersfield defender's hands in mid-air so it was disallowed. In the 24th minute, Huddersfield got repeat sets in Warrington's half and worked the ball out to the left wing where David Hodgson crossed untouched, but again the video referee disallowed the try, this time the video referee ruled that a member of the Warrington defence had been taken out. Huddersfield continued to dominate possession and field position and eventually, less than four minutes from half-time, after keeping the ball alive they scored out on the right hand side through Brett Hodgson. He missed the difficult conversion attempt so the score was 18–10 in favour of Warrington and would remain at that till the half-time siren.\nSecond half.\nAfter the break, the contest became quite an even arm wrestle and no points were scored until the sixtieth minute, when from about fifteen metres out from Huddersfield's line, Michael Monaghan ran from dummy half then passed from the tackle to Vinnie Anderson who hit a big gap and crashed over under the posts. The kick for Bridge was simple so the score was 24–10 in Warrington's favour. Four minutes later Huddersfield were penalised for a high tackle on Lee Briers by Scott Moore less than thirty metres from their line. Warrington decided to take the shot at goal and Bridge missed his first kick of the day so the score remained unchanged. The Wolves then successfully kept Huddersfield penned up in their own half, protecting their lead, until the seventy-seventh minute when the Giants got a consolation try: a Warrington mistake saw Huddersfield get a set of six in the opposition half and after keeping the ball alive and sending it through the hands out to David Hodgson on the wing, he stepped outside one defender and inside the next before reaching an arm out of the third defender's tackle to bounce the ball off the try-line. The video referee was again called upon to award the try and Brett Hodgson's sideline conversion was successful, bringing the score to 24–16. With just over a minute remaining, Warrington were down close to Huddersfield's line when the ball went to Lee Briers who kicked a field goal, putting the final score at 25 - 16.\nMan of the Match.\nThe Lance Todd Trophy is awarded to the Man of the Match in each year's Challenge Cup final and this year Michael Monaghan became the third Australian in history to win it."

        "title": "Bowling Revolution P-League",
        "text": " is a series of Japanese women-only bowling tournaments, developed solely for television. Entry into these tournaments is limited to selected members of the Japan Professional Bowling Association (JPBA), and amateurs who have qualified via open auditions. The show airs throughout Japan on BS Nittele (BS日テレ).\nThe \"P\" in P★League has five meanings: \"Pretty\", \"Power\", \"Passion\", \"Performance\" and \"Perfect\".\nHistory.\nDuring the 1970s, bowling was very popular among the Japanese. Japan had as many as 3,697 bowling establishments during the 1970s, with more than 120,000 bowling lanes installed.\nBy the late 1990s, the number had shrunk to only 600. In 2008, there were 1,100 bowling establishments and 25.1 million people bowled in Japan: about one in five Japanese.\nIn the 1970s, the JPBA produced a series of televised bowling tournaments, such as \"Ladies Challenge Bowl\" ( 1969-1975) and \"The Star Bowling\" ( 1978-1998), in the attempt to further push the sport's appeal, as well as showcase the women who competed in the JPBA. Big names such as Ritsuko Nakayama and Kayoko Suda competed in these tournaments. The formula worked - as the show's concept is used in many other Japanese bowling promotions on television, leading up to the present day.\nNakayama, along with the JPBA, created P-League in 2006 in an attempt to revive bowling's popularity on television once enjoyed in the 1970s.\nBroadcast history.\nThe P-League's television show premiered on BS Nittele on April 2, 2006, initially airing on Sunday nights at 7:30 p.m. JST. After Tournament 18 ended on March 29, 2009, the show was moved to the 5:30 p.m. timeslot beginning April 5, where it remained until the final episode of Tournament 36 aired on March 25, 2012. The show was then moved to Friday nights at 10:30 p.m., and it began airing in that time slot on April 6. On October 4, 2013, the show was moved one hour later to 11:30 p.m. After two years in that timeslot, the show was moved to 10:00 p.m. on October 4, 2015, where it remains to this day.\nParticipants.\nThe women who compete in P-League have either been chosen by the JPBA, or qualified through a try-out. The bowlers who compete in P-League are among the best women bowlers in the world. Most of the competitors hold an average of 190 or better, and several have bowled 300 games and 800 series.\nTournament details.\nThe television show consists of a series of tournament matches. An entire tournament is bowled and filmed in one day. However, when aired on television, the television coverage can span nine weeks because of the 30-minute time slot. Each tournament is bowled in a single-elimination bracket format.\nCurrent format.\nThe current format consists of a field of eighteen bowlers, being six groups of three bowlers (A through F) filled by lottery. In Round 1, the highest scorer in each group advances to a semi-final ABC or DEF match. The highest scorer in each ABC/DEF match advances to the finals. To keep the three-bowler format in the finals, the bowler who had the highest score among the remaining four bowlers from the ABC/DEF matches also bowls in the finals as the \"wild card\". The winner of the final match is the champion, with the remaining bowlers getting second and third place based on score.\nStarting with Tournament 20, bowlers with a lower score in the first round may be banned from the following tournament.\nStarting with Tournament 35, only members of the JPBA are allowed to participate. Members of the Japan Bowling Congress (JBC) and its National Team were allowed to compete in Tournaments 2 through 34.\nStarting with Tournament 43, P-League is now grouping three consecutive tournaments (43, 44, 45) as a season, with a season-ending, three-bowler final match to be held after the third tournament's final match.\nSeasons.\nStarting with T43, P-League has implemented a seasonal system in conjunction with its regular tournament system. The seasons are designed to be in-line with the Japanese television seasons, which traditionally are broken into four three-month periods (winter, spring, summer, and autumn.) The first season, called S1 from hereon will group T43, T44 and T45 together.\nIn the first tournament of each season, 24 current P-League members will participate in a six-ball roll-off. The top 18 bowlers will bowl in the first tournament. The low six bowlers will be cut from the tournament, and will be used later on as fillers for the second tournament after the six low scorers are banned. The banned bowlers will then return for the third tournament of the season to fill in for the banned bowlers from the second tournament.\nIn addition, a point system has been created, starting with S1. The points are broken down as such:\nThe points during the three tournaments of a season are added up, and the top three scorers will bowl in a season-ending championship. The winner of the match will be crowned \"Season Queen.\"\nAll prize money is paid to the bowlers in Japanese yen (¥). Prize money is currently: 1st Place - ¥300,000. Second and third place are no longer paid due to the new seasonal setup. In the seasonal final: \"Season Queen\" - ¥1,000,000 (100万円), 2nd Place - ¥300,000 (30万円) and 3rd Place - ¥100,000 yen (10万円).\nStarting with Tournament 35, the prize money is ¥3.0 million (300万円), regardless of when the 300 game is rolled.\nPrevious formats.\nTwelve bowlers competed. Four of the bowlers had an automatic berth to Round 2. In Round 1, the eight remaining bowlers competed in four head-to-head matches, with the winner in each match moving up to the Round 2. The winners of the four head-to-head matches in Round 2 moved up to the semi-final round. The two winners of the semi-finals moved up to the final match, while the two losers moved into the consolation match. The winner of the final match placed first, while the loser placed second, and the winner of the consolation match placed third.\nThe field was changed from twelve to sixteen, consisting of two groups (A and B) of eight bowlers. In Round 1, each group competed in four head-to-head matches, with the winners moving up to Round 2. The two groups of two Round 2 match winners moved up to the semi-final round. The two winners of the semi-finals moved up to the final match, while the two losers moved into the consolation match. The winner of the final match placed first, while the loser placed second, and the winner of the consolation match placed third.\nThe field was reduced to fourteen bowlers, being two groups (A and B) of seven bowlers, with one bowler in each group given a bye into Round 2, while the remaining six bowlers in each group competed in three head-to-head matches, with those winners moving on to Round 2. The two groups of two Round 2 match winners moved up to the semi-final round. The two winners of the semi-finals moved up to the final match, while the two losers moved into the consolation match. The winner of the final match placed first, while the loser placed second, and the winner of the consolation match placed third.\nThe field was again increased to sixteen bowlers. Four groups (A through D) of four bowlers were created. In Round 1, the two highest scorers in each group advanced to Round 2. In Round 2, two groups (AB and CD) were created, and the two highest scorers in each group advanced to the semi-final round. The four remaining bowlers are split into two head-to-head matches, with the winners advancing to the final match, while the two losers moved to the consolation match. The winner of the final match placed first, while the loser placed second, and the winner of the consolation match placed third.\nIn Tournament 13, the field was re-sized to fifteen bowlers. Five groups of three bowlers (A through E) were created. In Round 1, the highest scorer in each group advanced to the semi-finals. In the semi-finals, the five winners were split into two matches of three. For the sixth bowler, a wild card bowler was determined by the bowler who had the highest score among the losers in Round 1. The two highest scorers in each match moved up to the final match. The 1st through 4th places were determined by the order of the scores.\nVenue and filming conditions.\nCurrently, all the tournaments are filmed at the 68-lane \"Tamachi Hilane\" (田町ハイレーン) bowling center, located in Minato City, Tokyo, with the exception of T44, which was filmed at Tomikoshi Takashimadaira Bowl, located in Itabashi, Tokyo.\nA temporary filming studio enclosure is constructed around three pairs of lanes (lanes 57 through 62 at Tamachi, and 27 through 32 at Tomikoshi), complete with additional lighting and a pink-themed decor. On the outer pairs of lanes, the first half of those lanes past the foul line is turned into seating areas for the live viewing audience, which can number over one hundred spectators. Lanes 59 and 60 at Tamachi (29 and 30 at Tomikoshi) are bowled on as the tournament \"TV pair.\" As of T43, P-League features a new larger digital scoreboard above the far end of the pair. Many other parts of the establishment are turned into dressing rooms and interviewing areas.\nWhile the matches are being filmed, most of the remaining competitors sit in the \"settee area\" to the left of the tournament pair, along with the viewing audience, watch the matches. In earlier tournaments, when a member of the Japan National Team bowled, her JNT teammates in the settee area would yell \"saa iccho\" (さーいっちょ) for encouragement just before the bowler made her delivery. The television commentators are situated in the settee area to the right of the tournament pair. Usually, the commentators cannot be heard by the people in the studio during the match. But, on occasion a commentator will yell with enthusiasm, stirring up laughter among the bowlers. Ryo Itsuno once yelled, \"Nandedayō?\" (何でだよう？ or \"Why?\") while working on Round 25, Match E when Yūko Nakatani left a soft 10-pin in a crucial must-strike situation. Other phrases popular with Itsuno include \"YOSHA! SUTORAIKŪ!\" (よっしゃぁ～!ストラッイクー!) or \"JUST POCKET!\" (ジャストポケット!) after a strike, and \"GOOD JOB!\" or \"EXCELLENT!\" after a great spare conversion.\nThe scores are tracked by the computer scoring system on the TV pair, and occasionally need to be corrected by the bowlers themselves.\nCompetitors in the upcoming matches practice outside of the studio, using the remaining available lanes.\nAt the end of most telecasts, supporter Saki Nakajima hosts a segment called \"Chotto Kininaru!\" or \"I'm Curious!\" (ちょっと　気になる！) where she meets with the members of P-League, and together participate in various activities, such as interviews, bowling tips, and skill challenges.\nCast.\nActive bowlers (T1 to T33).\nKey to table:\nActive bowlers (T43 to present).\nKey to table:\nTournaments 34–42.\nNot in season format\nInactive and former bowlers.\nKey to table:\nWild card.\nIn Tournament 13, to fill the semi-final matches, a wild card bowler came from the highest score of the ten non-winning bowlers from the first-round matches. This was Urara Himeji with a 259 game, and she went on to win both her semi-final and final matches to win the tournament.\nStarting with Tournament 14, the final match wild card bowler became the player with the highest score among the ABC and DEF matches, but not winning her match. The wild card bowls in the final match against the winners of those two matches.\nBanned from the next tournament.\nStarting with Tournament 20, P-League instituted a system where bowlers could be disqualified from the next tournament because of a low score.\nUntil T46, Hiromi Matsunaga was the only bowler never to be banned under the \"Round 1 low score\" rule. She missed the cut in T43's qualifying round.\nTournament statistics.\nErrors.\nAll errors are the result of the first ball, unless otherwise noted.\nTournament notes.\nTournament 17: Hiromi Matsunaga makes P-League history by scoring the highest three-game series of 781 by way of games of 278, 288 and 215. The two semifinal matches are among the most exciting thus far. In the ABC match, Urara Himeji stays behind Matsunaga, and matches all but just one of Matsunaga's 10 consecutive strikes leading to the 10th frame. Himeji finishes first by striking out in the frame for a 279, and takes some of the pressure off of Matsunaga, while she deals with the possibly of rolling a perfect 300-game. Unfortunately, Matsunaga throws the ball high and leaves the 4-7, and finishes with a 288. In the DEF match, Mika Sakai keeps a steady lead over both Sanae Mori and Nao Ōishi. Mori's soft-10 pin leave in the 9th frame takes her out of contention. In the 10th, Sakai loses her chance of shutting out Ōishi by leaving a ringing 10-pin on the first ball. Sakai finishes with a 237, and forces Ōishi to strike out in the 10th to take a one-pin victory. Ōishi rolls the first two strikes, but leaves a half-10 pin on the last ball, to tie the match at 237. Ōishi wins the one-ball roll-off 10-9. Himeji takes the wild card position with her 279 score. Himeji takes advantage of her second wind via the wild card, and fires off a five-bagger to take command of the final match, and wins the match and tournament with a 238.\nTournament 28: For the first time in P-League history, all members of the Japan National Team won their first round matches (Ōishi, Asada, and Koizumi) and reached the ABC/DEF matches. It is also the first time all three positions in either the ABC or DEF match are filled by members of the Japan National Team. It is the first time all amateurs (four of them in Round 28) have qualified for the ABC/DEF matches. It is also the second time (previously T12) the final match consisted entirely of amateurs (Asada, Harigaya, and Ōishi as the wild card). With her win, Harigaya is the first bowler without affiliation to the Japan National Team nor the JPBA to win.\nTournament 30: Hiromi Matsunaga matches Urara Himeji's record of five tournament wins. The final match had a line-up that matched the line-up in Tournament 29 (Mori, Matsunaga, and Nishimura). The win was also the second time that Matsunaga won two consecutive tournaments (T18 and 19). This round also introduced Saki Nakajima as a supporter.\nTournament 31: Hiromi Matsunaga sets new records for not only the most tournament wins with six, but also the number of continuous wins (three). The rules changed in Round 31, where the lowest scorers in each of A-F matches are banned from the next tournament. This rule changed the dynamics of the A-F matches, as each bowler is now faced with not only losing the first round match, but also not rolling the worst score in the match. The mood was noticeably more serious in the A-F matches than in previous rounds.\nTournament 33: After four straight tournament wins, Hiromi Matsunaga loses to Aino Kinjō in Match 33C, 225-226. After a strike in the foundation ninth frame, Matsunaga brought a 21-pin lead over Kinjō with her to the 10th frame. Matsunaga rolls the ball straight into the head-pin, leaving the difficult 4-10 split. Missing the split, Kinjō is forced to cover 20 pins in the 10th frame. A strike on the first ball gives Kinjō a comfortable position to collect the needed ten pins in the last two balls. Kinjō was then defeated in the ABC semi-final match against Miki Nishimura. Nishimura and best-friend Urara Himeji meet up with Ayano Katai in the final match. Nishimura started strong with a turkey in the first three frames, along with Katai's four-bagger. Katai falls out of contention with consecutive opens in the fifth and sixth frames. After a slow start with a 65 in the fourth frame for Himeji, she finishes the match with eight straight strikes for a 245 - forcing Nishimura to match her, starting at the eighth frame for any chance of taking advantage of a break by Himeji. Nishimura ends up short, rolling a 233 and a second-place finish. It is Himeji's sixth tournament win, and is only one win away from matching Matsunaga's record of seven tournament wins.\nTournament 34: Three new members of P-League make their debut. Ayumi Kobayashi (age 21) earned her JPBA membership earlier in 2011. Satsuki Sasaki (23) is the newest member of the Japan national team. Kana Shimoide (17) is also a Japan national team member, and is currently attending high school. Mika Sakai breaks Hiromi Matsunaga's three-game record by rolling games of 275, 257 and 257 for a 789 series. Masami Hasegawa makes the final match for the first time. Mayumi Yoshida and Sakai tie in the final match with a 257-257 score. Yoshida wins the tie-breaker and tournament 10-7.\nTournament 35: Yūko Nakatani retires from P-League after Tournament 34. Three new JPBA members are added to the active roster: Yoshimi Kobayashi, Miki Takehara and Ami Tanaka. For the first time since Tournament 1, no members of the Japan National Team or JBC are in the line-up.\nTournament 36: Two new bowlers are added to the active roster: Hitomi Andō, a winner of the P-League open auditions, and Seul Ki Kim, a KPBA member.\nTournament 37: Mina Endō, one of the amateurs who passed the P-League open auditions, is added to the roster. This is the first appearance by an amateur after two tournaments. In the first semi-final match, Mitsuki Nakamura and Miki Nishimura both finish with a 237; using a frame-by-frame tie-breaker rule, where the last highest score in a frame wins, it was determined Nishimura was eligible for the Wild Card position. They both had a 217 in the ninth frame, but Nakamura had a 188, while Nishimura had a 197 in the eighth frame—this gave her the win.\nTournament 38: Ayano Iwami, the second amateur who passed the P-League open auditions, is added to the roster; she is the first \"back-up ball\" bowler (throwing with her right hand but hooking like a left-hander's ball) to feature in the show's history. Nao Ōishi, who was a member of the Japanese National Team, topped the pro test in 2012, regaining her eligibility into P-League. Ōishi, a three-time winner, was featured in \"dream match\" E, consisting of eight-time winner Hiromi Matsunaga and five-time winner Urara Himeji. These three bowlers, at the time of the tournament, are the three highest average bowlers in P-League history. Mitsuki Nakamura makes it to the final match for her first time with 267 scores in each of her first two matches. The final match was filled with 10-pin leaves, making for a low scoring event. Nakamura had a slight lead heading into the 10th frame. However, in the 10th, her first ball doesn't bite the lane, missing the head pin completely and leaves the 1-2-4-10 washout. Barely missing the spare, she finished with a 193. Needing just a 7-count on her last ball in the 10th, Miki Nishimura strikes and scores a 197, to secure her third P-League tournament win. Nakamura finishes second. Mika Sakai, after making the final as a wild card, places third with a 181.\nTournament 39: Hiromi Matsunaga extends her record for tournaments won to nine.\nTournament 40: For the first time since P-League switched to its current format in Tournament 14, the winner of Match C in the first round wins the overall tournament. Urara Himeji breaks the jinx by defeating Miki Takehara and Suzuna Miyagi. It is Himeji's seventh tournament win. It was also both Takehara and Miyagi's first visits to the final match. Himeji takes over second place in all-time scoring average with a 220.3 average for 67 games. Nao Ōishi drops to third place all-time at 220.2 after 47 games. Hiromi Matsunaga, averaging 231.2, continues to lead P-League in this category. Ayano Iwami bowls an all-time P-League low score of 123 in the first round.\nTournament 41: Aki Suzuki wins her first P-League tournament and becomes the first bowler since Tournament 26 to win after qualifying for the final match as the wild card. Mariko Sakurai becomes the second bowler in P-League history to convert the difficult 4-6-7-9-10 split, also known as the \"greek church,\" doing so in Match C. Aino Kinjō previously converted the split, doing so in Tournament 10 in the 3rd-place play-off match.\nTournament 42: Seul Ki Kim becomes the first foreign bowler to win a P-League tournament.\nTournament 43: T43 is the first of three tournaments that make up Season 1 (the others being T44 and T45.) Hiromi Matsunaga failed to qualify for T43 during the six-ball qualifier, which breaks her record of consecutive tournaments bowled without being banned at 23. Mai Funamoto makes her P-League debut by rolling the highest game of 264 by a first-timer. Masami Satō returns after being away from P-League since T35 due to an injury. Tamachi Hi-Lane will undergo renovations during T44. P-League will return to Tamachi Hi-Lane in T45. Sanae Mori wins her first P-League tournament by defeating Miki Nishimura and Mika Sakai.\nSeason 1 Final: Sanae Mori qualified for the Season 1 Final with 24 points by winning T43, semi-finals in T44, and 2nd place in T45. Yoshida Mayumi qualified by winning T44 and T45, despite failing to qualify for T43 during the six-ball qualifier. Miki Nishimura qualified with 13 points. She lost in the first round of T45 to Mori, and had to wait for the results of the matches for Ayumi Kobayashi (lost in 1st round T45, 10 points) and Hitomi Andō (lost in semi-finals DEF T45, 10 points). Mayumi became \"Season Queen\" with a score of 227. Mori and Nishimura tied at 213 and had a 1 ball roll-off for 2nd and 3rd place. They were tied after 3 roll-off frames, but Mori claimed 2nd place after she rolled a strike and Nishimura rolled 9 in the 4th roll-off frame.\nTournament 46: Mina Endō became the first amateur to win the tournament since Junko Harigaya in T28. Natsumi Koizumi finished 3rd in her first tournament as a professional. Sanae Mori bowled the lowest score (so far) to get the wild card over Aki Nawa by one pin (197-196). She finished 2nd. For the first time, Hiromi Matsunaga gets banned from the next tournament under the \"Round 1 low score\" rule in Match A.\nPublic affairs.\nMerchandise.\nBesides its weekly television show, P-League also sells merchandise for fans, in the form of DVDs, books, calendars, and other merchandise.\nCurrently, P-League has released seven DVD sets. None of the content have been shown in the television series. Volume 1 profiles the original members of P-League. Volumes 2 and 3 include \"doubles\" tournaments. Volume 4 features an \"East v. West\" team challenge, where the 20 competitors are divided into two teams of ten, based on their hometowns.\nOn April 25, 2011, P-League released a five-year anniversary commemorative DVD set, including all four previously released DVDs and an all-new P-League Volume 5. First editions of the DVD set includes a logo'd hand towel and pin. The first half of the DVD includes a top-10 matches showcase, followed by a split-making review from past tournaments. The second half includes a segment called \"P-TALK\", and is moderated by Japanese tarento Teruyuki Tsuchida.\nP-League released volume 6 on March 21, 2012. The top four bowlers at the time (Matsunaga, Himeji, Nishimura, and Mori) become team captains, and participate in a P-League draft. Sixteen bowlers are picked by the captains, forming four teams of five bowlers - including the captains. The teams battle in a best-of-three competition, combining team, doubles, and singles matches. Each of the winning teams move on to the final match, while the losing teams play for third place.\nVolume 7 was released on November 30, 2012. Four Japanese tarento are appointed as team captains, and participate in a P-League draft. Twenty bowlers are picked by the captains, forming four teams of five bowlers - with the captains not participating in the matches. Captains are:\nTournament format is similar to Volume 6. In the first round, the matches are Team Murata vs. Team Taka, and Team Miyamoto vs. Team Shinji. P-League's first 300 game is also featured in the volume set, although the scores in the DVD sets do not count towards official P-League statistics.\nVolume 8 will be released November 30, 2013. The P-League draft and tournament format remain the same as Volumes 6 and 7. In Volume 8, all four captains will bowl in the matches.\nP-League has released four sets of collectors cards, each using the tagline \"Fairies on the Lane\". The cards are similar to baseball cards in that the cards feature a photo of the bowler on the front, and her P-League statistics on the back. The sets were released in 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2013. The 2014 edition is scheduled for release in Winter 2014.\nP-League also publishes desk calendars. In Japan, October is often considered the start of calendar season, where stores and other sources throughout Japan release calendars for the following year. The more popular calendars are usually sold out within one month of release. The P-League calendar is only available via mail-order directly from the JPBA. Calendars for 2013 and 2014 have been made available.\nPublicity.\nTo market P-League in Japan, the members take part in television shows and magazines, as well as bowling clinics, demonstrations and practice sessions throughout East Asia.\nIn the August 26, 2008 issue of the swimsuit modeling magazine Friday Dynamite (フライデーダイナマイト), Aki Nawa, Sanae Mori, Junko Harigaya and others were showcased in a pictorial, posing in both bowling and casual attire.\nIn 2009, Aki Nawa represented P-League, along with other women representing other sports, in a comedy variety show. Nawa participated in a cosplay fashion show, dressing up as a Japanese high school girl.\nIn 2010, Urara Himeji and Miki Nishimura visited South Korea, and competed against two members of the Korean Professional Bowlers Association (KPBA). In April 2010, a group of P-League members, along with Mika Sakai's father Takeo Sakai, competed with various Japanese tarento in a one-minute strike competition.\nIn 2012, select members of P-League participated in the Japanese TV variety show \"Honoo-no Taiiku-kai TV\" () in a split making competition with various Japanese tarento. Sanae Mori, Rina Suzuki and Ayano Katai were guests on \"Takeshi's Todoroki Base\", hosted by Beat Takeshi, along with Emiko Namiki (並木惠美子), JPBA license 5 and a member of Class 1 (1967) when the JPBA was first founded. This show covered the history of women professional bowling in Japan, and ended with a pro versus tarento match.\nDHC, LBO and JBC.\nAccording to a blog entry made by Mai Takasaka in 2009, Daigaku Honyaku Center (DHC) was very displeased with JPBA president Ritsuko Nakayama appearing in a television commercial for Suntory, a direct competitor of DHC. DHC's chairman, Yoshiaki Yoshida is a major supporter of bowling in Japan, including the JBC. Soon after Yoshida learned of Nakayama's appearance in the Suntory commercial, he said that as a JPBA officer, Nakayama was irresponsible, and even used the term \"evil\" when describing her involvement in the commercial. Soon after, DHC cancelled the DHC Ladies Bowling Tour, the DHC Cup Girls Bowling International, and anything else it had to do with the JPBA.\nDHC then created the Ladies Bowling Organization (LBO), in order to compete directly with the JPBA. In February 2010, Hiroko Shimizu and Mai Takasaka resigned from the JPBA and P-League, and joined the LBO. Other non-P-League members of the JPBA also resigned and moved over to the LBO. Koji Yamamoto, an expert analyst for P-League, resigned from the JPBA to become Secretary General Executive Director of the LBO.\nSoon after the creation of the LBO, DHC and the LBO faxed a letter to the JPBA making a proposal to have P-League consist of both JPBA and LBO bowlers. The JPBA did not accept the proposal. DHC is now sponsoring a weekly TV show in Japan, with emphasis on the LBO, JBC and amateur bowlers alike. The show is hosted by the DHC Bowling Girls (Junko Harigaya is no longer a member, but she can still be seen in the opening and closing credits, along with current LBO members Yūki Akiyoshi and Yūka Sasaki.)\nOther complaints about the JPBA include management from within, and the decline of tournaments and prize money. Members of the LBO are also DHC employees, and therefore work in other capacities within DHC, such as endorsements of DHC products. JPBA members, on the other hand, need to work in other jobs outside of the JPBA to earn a living. Before moving to the LBO, Shimizu worked nights in Tokyo at a bar as a hostess. She is currently vice-president of the LBO.\nDespite the intensity between the JPBA and DHC/LBO, DHC-sponsored bowlers Keaki Watanabe, Miki Nishimura, Mika Sakai and Aino Kinjō stayed with the JPBA and P-League. Also, former Japan National Team members Nao Ōishi and Natsumi Koizumi chose the JPBA over the LBO when deciding to become a professional. Current JNT member Junko Harigaya repeated her 2011 win in the amateur division of the JLBC's 2012 Professional Women's Bowling Rookie Battle, solidifying her commitment with the JPBA. Harigaya currently works in marketing for Sunbridge - a Japan-based distributor for Brunswick Corporation's bowling division.\nAs of Tournament 35, no JBC members are allowed to participate in P-League. According to the JBC, there were reported incidents where its members were being stalked in public by fans of P-League. As a safety measure put down by the JBC Board of Directors on September 25, 2011, the JBC will no longer participate in P-League.\nTo fill the void left by the departed JBC members, P-League held a \"Next Era P-Leaguer\" audition, and was publicized throughout Tournament 35. Female bowlers - regardless of amateur/professional status - between the ages of 16 and 28 were allowed to participate. Hitomi Andō, Mina Endō and Ayano Iwami were the top qualifiers. Andō, a professional bowler, debuted in Tournament 36, followed by amateurs Endō (T37), and Iwami (T38)."

        "text": "Chris Boyd (born 21 July 1958 in Wellington) is a New Zealand rugby union coach, who is currently the Director of Rugby at English Premiership team Northampton Saints. He has previously coached at Wellington, \nthe New Zealand under-20 National Team, and Super Rugby franchise the Hurricanes.\nCoaching career.\nBoyd's first coaching role was as coach of Tawa Rugby Club, where he spent nine years from 1989 to 1998. In that year he took over as Wellington's second XV coach, becoming assistant coach to the provincial side, the Wellington Lions, in 2003. From 2006 to 2008 he was assistant coach at the Sharks Super Rugby franchise. He then worked at the International Rugby Academy of New Zealand as a coaching services advisor, and was defensive coach for the Tongan team at the 2011 Rugby World Cup, with Tonga famously defeating eventual finalists France 14–19 in the pool stages.\nWellington Lions.\nBoyd was appointed as Wellington Lions coach in 2011, and took over as head coach of the national under-20 team in 2012, a position he vacated until 2014.

        "title": "Arthur Atkinson (rugby league)",
        "text": "Arthur Atkinson (5 April 1906 – 1963), also known by the nickname of 'Bruss', was an English professional rugby league footballer who played, mostly as a , from 1925 to 1940. He competed at representative level for Great Britain, England and Yorkshire, and at club level for Castleford. He was captain of his club for some time.\nSome believe Atkinson holds the world record for a goal kick in any form of rugby because he kicked a penalty from in the 20-10 victory over St. Helens at their Knowsley Road ground on 26 October 1929. However, England and Cumberland forward Martin Hodgson kicked a penalty goal for Swinton against Rochdale Hornets at the Athletic Grounds, Rochdale on 13 April 1940.\nPlaying career.\nClub career.\nArthur Atkinson, who was tall, said he had not seen a rugby ball until the age of 17. He was introduced to the sport by William Asquith, who suggested as they were going home from work at a coal pit that they should detour to watch Castleford training at their old ground. He was spotted by Walter Smith, Castleford's representative on the Yorkshire County Committee and a member of the Rugby League Council, as being \"a big, likely sort of lad\". Smith encouraged him to join in on the spot using borrowed kit. He was in the club's A-Team as a for the next game, against Brotherton St Johns, and played a few more times that season. In the following season, he played more frequently for the team, sometimes as a , and had his first match for the senior side against Windhill, when he played one half as a and the other as full-back. When Castleford became a professional club for the following 1926–27 season, Atkinson played as a for a while before becoming the regular full-back for three seasons. His switch to what became his regular position as a came shortly before he was first selected for a representative side in 1929.\nIn August 1928 his request to be put on the transfer list was granted. He was still at the club a year later when the decision was made to sign his 18-year-old brother, Joseph.\nAtkinson was Castleford's captain from around 1930. Under his leadership, the club won the Yorkshire County League in the 1932–33 season. That success included six \"doubles\" (home and away victories) over opposing teams and an unbeaten record at home, where the only opponent to come away with any league points was the York club. They won the same competition in the 1938–39 season, although he missed a large part of the campaign after injuring his leg in a match at Warrington in January 1939, which eventually resulted in him needing an operation to remove cartilage in March of that year.\nThe league match against Wakefield Trinity in February 1934 was designated a benefit match for Atkinson, who was in his tenth season at the club.\nPlaying as captain at right-centre, Atkinson scored a conversion in Castleford's 11-8 victory over Huddersfield in the 1935 Challenge Cup final at Wembley Stadium, London on 4 May 1935, in front of a crowd of 39,000. In September that year, in one of the first matches of the new season, he and David Morgan Jenkins, a Dewsbury player, were sent off.\nAtkinson joined the Royal Air Force in December 1940. His 431 appearances for Castleford, mean that he is joint-second (along with Dean Sampson) in the club's all-time appearance list behind John Joyner, who has 613-appearances. He is an inductee of the Castleford Tigers Hall of Fame.\nCounty honours.\nArtie Atkinson won caps, generally playing centre, for Yorkshire in the 17-22 defeat by Glamorgan &amp; Monmouth in Cardiff on 15 April 1929, scoring one try, and a goal in the 12-25 defeat by Australia at Wakefield Trinity's stadium on 20 November 1929, the 9-3 victory over Cumberland at Huddersfield's stadium on 22 January 1930, the 6-13 defeat by Glamorgan &amp; Monmouth at Hunslet's stadium on 26 February 1930, the 25-15 victory over Lancashire at Wakefield Trinity's stadium on 18 October 1930, scoring a try, and six conversions in the 33-12 victory over Glamorgan &amp; Monmouth at Halifax's stadium on 15 April 1931, scoring a conversion in the 8-11 defeat by Lancashire at Warrington's stadium on 17 October 1931, playing on the in the 20-35 defeat by Cumberland at York's stadium on 28 October 1931, scoring a try in the 10-39 defeat by Cumberland at Whitehaven's stadium on 1 October 1932, scoring a try and two conversions in the 30-3 victory over Lancashire at Wakefield Trinity's stadium on 29 October 1932, the 0-10 defeat by Cumberland at Whitehaven's stadium on 29 September 1934, the 5-5 draw with Lancashire at Leeds' stadium on 9 January 1935, the 16-5 victory over Lancashire at Widnes' stadium on 12 October 1935, and the 6-28 defeat by Lancashire at Castleford's stadium on 21 October 1936.\nInternational honours.\nArtie Atkinson won caps for England, playing against Other Nationalities in 1929 and 1930, against Wales in 1931 and 1932, against Australia in 1933 and against France in 1936. He also won caps for Great Britain against Australia (three matches in 1929-30, another three in 1932, followed by one in 1933 and another in 1936), as well as three matches against New Zealand in 1932. He was also named in the England team to face Wales on 1 February 1936.\nAtkinson said after his first Test experience, in November 1929, \nHis journey on the 1932 tour to Australia was marked before his leaving in April by various presentations - mostly monetary and gold items - from his club's directors, supporters and players. His return in September was lauded by the town council, who had organised a civic reception in his honour.\nThe \"Yorkshire Evening Post\" arranged to carry regular weekly reports provided by Atkinson, Jim Brough and Harry Sunderland during the 1936 Australasia tour.\nPersonal life.\nAtkinson married Winifred Dix on 16 November 1932. He took ownership of the Keel Inn, Castleford, around the same time. In 1937, he and his wife faced several charges after a police raid at the pub in August found them selling alcoholic drinks outside licensed hours. She was fined and the charges against him were dismissed provided that he paid court costs.\nIn 1938, Atkinson. who occasionally also played cricket, stood unsuccessfully as an independent candidate in elections for Castleford council. He was placed fourth out of five in the Wheldale ward, behind three Labour candidates.\nReferences.\nNotes\nCitations"

        "title": "Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals",
        "text": "Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals was a professional basketball game that was played on June 14, 1998 between the visiting Chicago Bulls and the Utah Jazz at the Delta Center, in Salt Lake City, Utah. The game is widely cited as one of the most intense and iconic games in NBA history, and it is best known for Bulls superstar Michael Jordan executing a quick cross-over on Jazz forward Bryon Russell, and then hitting a jumpshot from behind the free throw line with 5.2 seconds remaining in the 4th quarter to put the Bulls up 87-86. Chicago then held on to win after John Stockton missed a 3-point field goal, winning their sixth NBA championship in eight years. Game 6 was the final game with the Bulls for Michael Jordan and coach Phil Jackson (both would retire from the National Basketball Association (NBA), then eventually return). This game earned, and still holds, the highest TV ratings of an NBA game of all time.\nBackground.\nBoth the Utah Jazz and the Chicago Bulls finished the regular season tied for the best record in the NBA at 62–20. The Jazz defeated the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference finals, and the Bulls defeated the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals, setting up a rematch of the prior year's NBA Finals, which the Bulls won in six games. The Jazz swept the regular season series against the Bulls 2–0, giving them the tiebreaker for home-court advantage.\nIn the Finals series, the Jazz won Game 1, while the Bulls won Games 2–4. At the United Center in Game 5, Michael Jordan missed a potential game-winning 3-pointer at the buzzer, allowing the Jazz to stave off elimination with an 83–81 victory and return to Utah for Game 6 and a potential Game 7. None of the previous five Finals appearances for the Bulls had gone to a Game 7.\nGame summary.\nScottie Pippen scored the opening basket on a slam dunk that aggravated a back injury, causing him pain and difficulty moving throughout the game. Pippen was limited to 8 points on 4–7 shooting in 26 minutes played. Michael Jordan took 35 of the Bulls' 67 shots, leading the team in scoring and minutes played with 45 points in 44 minutes. Karl Malone led the Jazz in both categories with 31 points in 43 minutes.\nIn the first half of the game, while the Jazz led 28–24 with just under 10 minutes left in the second quarter, Jazz guard Howard Eisley saved a pass that almost sent the ball out of bounds. As the shot clock was running down, Jazz forward/center Antoine Carr passed the ball a long distance to Shandon Anderson, but the ball flew over Anderson's hands. Eisley caught the ball and hit a 3-pointer, but referee Dick Bavetta ruled that Eisley released the ball after the shot clock expired. Replays showed that the ball had left Eisley's hands with a second left on the shot clock (the NBA did not use instant replay to review calls until 2002). Calling the game for NBC, Bob Costas narrated a replay of Eisley's shot: \"See if the ball isn't out of his hand. One second...it's on the way, and they missed the call.\" Jazz head coach Jerry Sloan opted not to argue the call because it may risk a second technical foul which could lead to ejection. In the second half, Bulls guard Ron Harper made a jump shot as the shot clock went off that tied it at 79; at the NBC play-by-play, Costas announced that Harper released the ball on time, but commentator Isiah Thomas, narrating a replay of Harper's shot, considered it to be \"a tough call.\" At the replay, Costas indicated the call was likely missed and gave context: \"If they missed that call, it’s a five-point swing in missed calls on shot-clock situations. They took a Howard Eisley three away, wrongly, in the first half. This one was even closer but it appeared that Harper may have been just a fraction of a second behind the shot clock.” Thomas concluded, \"I think that was a shot clock violation.\"\nAlthough the Jazz held a 49–45 lead at halftime and a 66–61 at the end of the 3rd quarter, they let them slip away in the fourth. John Stockton hit a 3-pointer with 41.9 seconds left to give the Jazz an 86–83 lead. Michael Jordan scored a layup on the following possession to cut the lead to one. With 18.9 seconds left and the Jazz in possession, Jordan stole the ball from Karl Malone in the low post and dribbled down the court. Bryon Russell guarded Jordan as time wound down. Jordan drove inside the 3-point line, and executed a quick cross-over. Jordan then hit a 20-footer to give the Bulls an 87–86 lead with 5.2 seconds left. Neil Funk made the call for the Bulls' radio network.\nBob Costas, calling the game on television for NBC, had this call.\nThen as the replays of Jordan's shot were being shown, Costas added.\nUtah called timeout to set up the final play of the game. John Stockton took the inbound pass, and missed a game-winning 3-pointer that would've sent the series to a Game 7, and the Bulls celebrated. It was mentioned by Costas that Ron Harper may have blocked the ball with his fingertips. Antoine Carr was open during the shot, but the rebound went just out of his reach. The game was Jordan's final shot as a Bulls player and his 25th game-winning shot for Chicago.\nBroadcasting.\nIn the United States, the NBC television network broadcast the game and all other 1998 NBA Finals games live under the \"NBA on NBC\" series. The game registered a 22.3 Nielsen rating and 38 share with average 35.9 million viewers - the highest rated and most watched game in the history of the NBA, 72 million people in the US watched at least part of the game. The previous record was a 21.2 rating and 37 share for Game 7 of the 1988 NBA Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Detroit Pistons.\nLegacy.\nMichael Jordan's game-winner to put the Bulls up 87–86 with 5.2 seconds left is remembered as one of the greatest plays in NBA history. In 2010, John Hollinger of ESPN ranked Jordan's last shot as a Bulls player fourth among 50 best single-game performances. The shot was recreated for the 2006 television ad \"Second Generation\".\nThe officiating of this game continued to be discussed decades later. In 2008, Tim Buckley of the \"Deseret News\" (a daily newspaper published in Salt Lake City) wrote in a profile of Jazz coach Jerry Sloan that the calls involving Howard Eisley and Ron Harper \"to this day continue to be discussed and debated by disgruntled Jazz faithful.\"\nBryon Russell remarked in 2009: \"Whether he pushed off or not, he was making that shot.\" John Stockton said Jordan did push off, but he would not have called it as an offensive foul. In \"The Last Dance\" documentary, Jordan shared his thoughts. \"Everybody said I pushed off,\" Jordan told the documentary crew. \"Bullshit. His energy was going that way. I didn't have to push him.\"\nIn 2009, Jordan mentioned Russell in his Hall of Fame induction speech, recalling an interaction they had during Jordan's first retirement in 1994: \"[A]t this time, I had no thoughts of coming back and playing the game of basketball. Bryon Russell came over to me and said, 'Why did you quit? You know I could guard you.' ... From this day forward, if I ever see [Russell] in shorts, I'm coming at him.\" In response, Russell challenged Jordan to a game of one-on-one for charity. Such a match-up has not yet taken place, though the Utah Flash of the NBA Development League did stage a halftime game between Russell and a Jordan look-alike. The Flash offered refunds to fans who expected Jordan actually to appear.\nAfter Michael Jordan retired, interest in the NBA declined, especially after the 1998–99 NBA lockout. Commenting on how the 1999 NBA Finals had the lowest TV ratings for a Finals series since 1981, Eric Boehlert wrote in \"Salon.com\": \"Viewers stayed away because the season had been shortened; Michael Jordan had just retired; the Spurs and the Knicks faced each other in the Finals.\" Game 5 of the 2000 NBA Finals had only half as many viewers as Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals. However, Game 5 of the 2001 Finals, when the Los Angeles Lakers won their second consecutive championship under former Bulls coach Phil Jackson, had the highest ratings of a championship-winning game on the network since Game 6 of the 1998 Finals. NBC's broadcast rights to NBA games expired after the 2002 NBA Finals, when the Lakers won their third consecutive championship under former Bulls coach Phil Jackson. The 2003 NBA Finals, now on ABC had even worse ratings (9.8 million), and only 11.5 million watched the 2005 Finals; the San Antonio Spurs won both years."

        "title": "Holbeck Rugby Club",
        "text": "Holbeck Rugby Club, also known as the Holbeck Imps, was a semi-professional rugby league club based in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire, England. The club were the original owners of Elland Road football stadium, now the home of Leeds United.\nHistory.\nThe exact date Holbeck were formed is unknown, but they joined the Northern Union in time for its second season in 1896–97. They played for eight seasons, from 1896–97 to 1903–04. As semi-professionals, Holbeck played at the Recreation Ground on Elland Road.\nThe city of Leeds had an abundance of rugby football clubs and although members of the Yorkshire RFU, which was in turn part of the RFU, it was decided to form a more local association. It was for this reason that the Leeds &amp; District organization was formalised when a meeting took place at the Green Dragon Hotel, Leeds, on 27 September 1888. The founding clubs were Bramley, Holbeck, Hunslet, Kirkstall, Leeds Parish Church, Leeds St John’s and Wortley.\nIn the 1896–97 season, the league was divided into Yorkshire and Lancashire Senior Competitions, Holbeck entering the former. They finished 15th (second bottom) with 18 points from 30 games. In 1897, when the lease was not renewed on Holbeck Recreation Ground, they bought the Old Peacock Ground from Bentley's Brewery for £1,100, with a stipulation that it remained a football ground for at least seven years, and that all the catering rights should be held for that period by the brewery. The site of the Old Peacock Ground, an open grass field, was at the foot of Beeston Hill on the Leeds to Elland Road. The land was known locally as the Old Peacock Ground due to the close proximity to the pub of the same name which it faced.\nThe club erected a new stand in the close season in readiness for the forthcoming 1898–99 season. The ground eventually became known simply as Elland Road.\nOver the next four seasons Holbeck struggled, finishing 14th in 1897–98, 13th in 1898–99, 13th in 1899–1900 and 14th again in 1900–01, in each case out of 16 clubs.\nAt the end of this season the top seven clubs in both the Lancashire Senior Competition and the Yorkshire Senior Competition (which included Hunslet) split and formed the \"new\" Rugby League. The remaining clubs, with several new additions continued in the Lancashire and Yorkshire Senior Competitions, which became in effect two regional second divisions.\nOnly limited County League information is available for (1901–02). Holbeck finished in fifth position, but unfortunately for them there was no promotion and relegation. At the end of this season, several more clubs withdrew and the league was again re-organised into two divisions of 16 clubs.\nIn 1902–03, Holbeck again finished 5th out of the 16 clubs. For the 1902–03 season football team Leeds Woodville ground shared as tenants of Holbeck Rugby Club.\nIn 1903–04, in what was to be Holbeck’s last season, Wakefield Trinity were champions with 55 points from 32 games, with St Helens and Holbeck in joint second place, both on 39 points. A promotion play-off took place on a neutral ground on Saturday 14 May 1904 and St. Helens were promoted after beating Holbeck 7–0. As a result, the club decided that it would be financially unable to continue in the second division and folded.\nSuccessor clubs.\nAt a meeting at the Griffin Hotel in Boar Lane in August 1904, a new Association football club, Leeds City Association Football Club, was formed and it was agreed that the Elland Road ground would be rented for the upcoming season. It has been suggested that Holbeck Rugby Club reformed as Leeds City but there does not appear to be any hard evidence to support this claim.\nLeeds City were expelled from the Football League in 1919 but Leeds United took their place five years later and have played at Elland Road ever since.\nClub colours.\nSeveral articles suggest that Holbeck RFC played in blue and yellow (or gold), which are the sporting colours of Leeds.\nClub records.\nClub league record.\nSource:\nHeading Abbreviations\nPl = Games played; W = Win; D = Draw; L = Lose; PF = Points for; PA = Points against; Diff = Points difference (+ or -); Pts = League Points \nLeague points: for win = 2; for draw = 1; for loss = 0.\nSeveral fixtures and results.\nThe following are a selection of Holbeck's fixtures from the eight seasons in which they played semi-professional rugby league :- \n \nCompetition Abbreviations\nYSC = Yorkshire Senior Competition; D2 = 2nd Division\nD2 PO = 2nd Division Promotion Play-Off\nCC R2 = Challenge Cup, round 2"

        "text": "The Canadian Junior Golf Association (CJGA) is a national junior golf association. The CJGA is a not-for-profit \"registered Canadian amateur athletic association\" (RCAAA) with Revenue Canada.\nEstablished in 1993, the CJGA was founded to give junior golfers in Canada an opportunity to develop their competitive skills. Its Junior Program offers over 90 tour stops across Canada and includes regional, provincial, and national championships. The elite junior is also able to represent the CJGA and Canada at a number of international events.\nCompetitive Development Program.\nThrough its six-stage competitive development program that focuses on tournaments, clinics, international competitions, and mentoring programs with PGA Tour professionals, the CJGA introduces the game to juniors as young as five and offers competitive multi-day events for the more advanced golfer. The CJGA acts as a feeder system to provincial and national competitions, collegiate and university golf, as well as professional and recreational golf.\nLevel 1.\nThe developmental stage of the CJGA program. Juniors between the ages of 5-13 are introduced to the basics of the game of golf through the Junior Linkster program, which include learning proper etiquette and competing in a friendly environment. The clinics serve as tools for juniors hoping to build a foundation for their future golfing endeavors.\nLevel 2.\nAfter spending time in the Junior Linkster Program, juniors are presented with the opportunity to participate in multi-day events. The tournaments are more competitive and structured than those on the Junior Linkster series and attempt to instill a higher level of professionalism.\nLevel 3.\nJuniors who have proven their talents through CJGA Junior Tour events are provided with the opportunity to test their skills in Regional and Provincial events, which take on an added degree of intensity and structure. There is an application policy as well as certain procedures that must be followed for those who wish to participate in these tournaments.\nLevel 4.\nThese events are high profile, with media and sponsor representatives on hand. Applicants for these events are selected based on their performances in other CJGA Junior Tour events held earlier in the season. There is an added amount of pressure on juniors participating in national tournaments because of the status of the events. Both stroke and match play formats are offered in national tournaments conducted by the CJGA.\nLevel 5.\nCJGA Juniors are given the opportunity to qualify for prestigious international events through various qualifying tourneys that are conducted during the earlier months of the golfing season. Aspiring juniors who earn the chance to represent the CJGA in an international tournament will be able to test their skills against some of the premier junior golfing talent that the rest of the world has to offer and, in many cases, will receive mentoring support from Canada's top touring professional golfers. The CJGA's international selection committee selects teams for various international tournaments based on cumulative results. CJGA Team Canada members will learn the necessary attributes and gain the experiences needed to possibly move on to Canada's national teams.\nLevel 6.\nThe objective of the CJGA Competitive Development Program is to assist junior golfers in their efforts to earn a spot on a golf team at the university level either in Canada or the United States.\nInternational Success.\nIn 2003, CJGA Team Canada captured its first World Junior Golf Cup in Scotland, defeating a tough American contingent. The team was also victorious in 2005, 2006 and 2007, over IJGT Team USA and the Fife Golfing Union. The 2003 victory was followed up with CJGA Team Canada's first North America Cup victory in 2004 at Berkeley Hall Golf Club in Hilton Head, SC and in 2007 at Weston Golf &amp; Country Club in Toronto, Ont.\nPGA Tour Influence.\nUSA Professionals such as Stephen Ames and Ian Leggatt assist in junior golf in Canada with the CJGA. In March 2009 Stephen Ames was named as the CJGA's national spokesperson.\nStephen Ames Cup.\nIn 2005, Stephen Ames worked with the CJGA to create the Stephen Ames Cup, an annual Ryder Cup style tournament that brings together junior golfers from Trinidad &amp; Tobago and Canada. The teams travel to each other's country as they alternate playing host to the tournament. This August (2009) the tournament will be played in Calgary, Alberta.\nPartner Organizations.\nThe CJGA has partnered with other associations to help assist juniors golfers gain access to the CJGA and help CJGA members who wish to play on other tours.\n1. American Junior Golf Association (AJGA)\n2. International Junior Golf Tour (IJGT)\n3. Washington Jr. Golf Association\n4. Junior Linskter Tour Canada (BC) - Harry White\n5. Brent Morrison Academy (BC)\nAlumni.\nAlena Sharp, James Lepp, Jessica Shepley, Derek Gillespie, Seema Sadekar, Will Mitchell, and Chris Baryla are a couple of the hundreds of CJGA alumni who have participated in CJGA programs and are currently playing on professional tours such as the PGA Tour, the LPGA Tour, the Canadian Tour and the Futures Tour. Nearly fifty 2008 CJGA graduates are participating as freshman in NCAA competition in 2008–2009."

The water temperature ranges from 15 to 20 °C (59 to 68 °F). \nAlthough the waves in central Chile are bigger, the waves in the north are stronger and are usually better suited for surfing.\nThe cold waters of central and southern Chile can be brutal to surf, therefore, surfers adventuring into those areas are strongly advised on using a protective wetsuit to protect against the elements.\nSome of the most popular surfing spots in Chile are:\nPichilemu.\nLocated south west of Santiago, Pichilemu is the number one spot for surfing in Chile. The town is the host of the annual national championships. This location offers something for every kind of surfer. Beginners usually try to catch their first waves at the beaches of \"Las Terrazas\" or \"La Puntilla\". While more skilled usually hang out at Infiernillo, and only the most experienced surfers adventure into Punta de Lobos where the waves can get up to 6 meters high.\nRitoque.\nJust north of Viña del Mar, Ritoque is one of Chile’s most beautiful places for surfing. On the 13 kilometer long Ritoque beach waves can get as high as 7 meters.\nArica.\nClose by the city of Arica is the \"Playa Gringo\", whereas the name tells many US Americans go to surf. Even though there are spots with rocks in the water, the qualification for the national championship takes place there. Waves can get up to 4 meters high.\nTotoralillo.\nTotoralillo is located 12 km to the south of Coquimbo and 450 km at the north of Santiago. This Tahiti style beach, white sanded and clear water, offers all level surfers 6 different waves to enjoy: Derecharcha, Punta, Cabañas, Muro, Cacho and Pipe, right and left waves.\nIt counts with a surf school, and different cabins where to stay.

Salaries are up to five times higher and the position lends itself to longevity: Australian football players generally retire at around 30, whereas American football punters can play well into their 40s (in fact, one of the players listed below, Darren Bennett, played 11 seasons in the NFL after leaving behind an Australian rules career when he was nearing 30). Initially Australians sought out American football careers, although now NFL scouts are more often actively seeking punters from Australia.\nThe first Australian to play American Football at a meaningful level was former Australian rules footballer Pat O'Dea in 1896 who was a College Football Hall of Fame and All-American player who set many kicking records \nGridiron in Australia is only at amateur level, so the pathway for Australians to NFL teams is typically limited to other professional Australian sports. For almost a decade, the NFL has placed full-time development officers in Australia, including Australian rules football hopeful Dwayne Armstrong. There is a full-time punting academy in Australia, Prokick Australia, run by former NFL free agent Nathan Chapman, which is aimed at training and assessing talented punters from Australia for positions in major U.S. colleges and the NFL.\nMore recently, the Ray Guy Award, presented to the top punter in NCAA Division I FBS football, was won by Australians six times in the last seven seasons of the 2010s—by Tom Hornsey in 2013, Tom Hackett in 2014 and 2015, Mitch Wishnowsky in 2016, Michael Dickson in 2017, and Max Duffy in 2019. Hornsey played for the University of Memphis, Hackett and Wishnowsky for the University of Utah, Dickson for the University of Texas, and Duffy for the University of Kentucky.

This year marked the 25th anniversary of the Wallabies' only previous Grand Slam tour, which saw the Wallabies sweep all four matches and saw David Campese, Mark Ella, Nick Farr-Jones, and Michael Lynagh achieve international prominence. Also, for the second consecutive year, a Bledisloe Cup match was contested by New Zealand and Australia outside of either country, this time in Tokyo. The final event of the series, the Barbarians' traditional Final Challenge, involved New Zealand, with the Barbarians winning over a mostly second-string All Blacks side.\nFor the first time since the inception of the IRB World Rankings in 2003, all of the top 20 teams in the rankings played matches in the November window. The only top-20 teams not playing in the November tours were Uruguay and the United States, which played a two-legged 2011 Rugby World Cup qualifying tie during November.\nThis year's series was also marked by more non-Test matches pitting Test teams with top-level club teams than in recent years. Matches of this type are often called \"midweek matches\" because they are traditionally played at midweek, most often on Wednesday, although they can also be scheduled on a weekend when the touring team has no Test scheduled. Australia and South Africa both scheduled two such matches; the Wallabies won both of their matches comfortably, while the Springboks lost both of theirs."

        "title": "David Shepherd (rugby union)",
        "text": "David John Shepherd (1936 – 1 October 2003) was an advertising executive and one of the few Englishmen to play for the Australia national rugby union team.\nDavid Shepherd was one of the rare men who graduated from club rugby in Melbourne through the Victorian state team to the ranks of the Wallabies. He played his first Test against New Zealand in 1964 and was capped four times more before a crippling injury forced his early retirement from the game.\nEarly life.\nShepherd was born in Cheshire and boarded at Blundell's School in Devon. He was 17 when his father was sent to Australia in 1953 to become chairman of Unilever.\nShepherd joined the advertising industry, which suited his intellect and his insightful knowledge of others, especially regarding how they were motivated. He quickly moved up the ladder and became a manager at an early age. In January 1959, he married Louise Palmer, with whom he had four children: Tim, James, Annabelle (deceased) and Georgina.\nRugby career.\nShepherd lived and worked in Melbourne from 1955 to 1965 and during this time played rugby - and, less seriously, cricket - with the Harlequin Club, where he stood out as a natural and inspirational leader both on and off the field of play. He was club captain and captain of Victoria for a number of years until his talents were eventually recognised by the national selectors. He was considered a \"find\" at the 1963 Wallaby trials in Sydney and was picked for the tour South Africa that year.\nHis performance against the Northern Transvaal provincial side made him a serious Test candidate, but Australia already had a powerful and cohesive back row and Shepherd had no alternative but to wait out one more season.\nHis chance eventually came in the third Test against the All Blacks. Australia won the match handsomely and Shepherd cemented his place in the Wallabies. In a written tribute, his former Australian teammate, Mike Jenkinson, has described the way he played \"with a sort of breathless aggression, giving ground to nobody and showing utter disinterest in reputations. There seemed to be no problem for him in stepping up from Melbourne club rugby to this new level. \"He tackled hard, corner-flagged in the required manner, and was prominent in the forward charges\", Jenkinson wrote. \"He rucked as if he had learnt the game in King Country (a rugged part of NZ's North Island, from where the hard men reputedly came), not south-west England.\"\nIt was a huge loss for Victoria and the Harlequin Club when Shepherd moved to Sydney and the Gordon RFC in 1966 to continue his international career. It was only natural, somehow, that he would then captain Gordon until his retirement from rugby.\nLater life.\nDespite his Wallaby status he still had a soft spot for \"The Old Country\"; not in rugby, but his support for its cricket team continued, although in latter years he silently despaired of the MCC coming up with the goods on the cricket pitch. His Englishness was apparent in his continued good manners, irrespective of the situation, although he could be somewhat irascible when annoyed by waiters or tradesmen. The term \"my good man\" was the signal that danger was imminent.\nShepherd left Australia to work in Southeast Asia, where he became regional CEO of the multinational advertising firm USP Benson Needham, operating first of all from Singapore – where he coached the Singapore national rugby union team – then from Bangkok.\nHe retired to Sunshine Beach, Noosa, in 1995. In 2003 he was badly injured in a car accident near his home and died shortly afterwards from a heart attack."

        "text": "The 1959 Ice Hockey World Championships were held between 5 March and 15 March 1959, in Prague, and six other cities in Czechoslovakia. Canada, represented by the Belleville McFarlands, won their 18th World championship, winning every game but their last. The Soviet Union finished second, claiming their fifth European title followed by the host Czechoslovaks. In the consolation round, West Germany played against East Germany for the first time in a World Championship, winning easily, 8–0. The Canadian games were broadcast on CJBQ radio by Jack Devine.\nWorld Championship Group A (Czechoslovakia).\nFirst round.\nTwelve teams played in three groups where first and second place advanced to the final round, while the 3rd and 4th place teams competed in a consolation round.\nGroup 1.\nPlayed in Bratislava.\nGroup 2.\nPlayed in Brno.\nGroup 3.\nPlayed in Ostrava.\nFinal Round.\nPlayed in Prague. Canada finished first by virtue of a better goal differential, 14 to 10. The Czechoslovaks captured bronze in dramatic fashion, they needed to win against the previously undefeated Canadians in the final game and by enough of a margin to beat out the Americans on tie-breakers. By scoring an empty net goal in the dying moments of the final game the Czechs equaled the Americans on points (6 each), and goal differential (8 each). The final tie-breaker was goal average, in which the Czechs had the advantage 1.57 to 1.53.\nConsolation round.\nPlayed in Kladno, Mladá Boleslav and Kolín.\nWorld Championship Group B (Czechoslovakia).\nThree other nations played a secondary tournament in Plzeň. A Czechoslovakia 'B' (junior) team also participated in the tournament. Had their games counted, they would've finished first."

        "title": "Guyana Cricket Board",
        "text": "The Guyana Cricket Board is the ruling body for cricket in Guyana.\nGuyana Cricket Board.\nThe Guyana Cricket Board has regions who play cricket in the Country. Below is the history of the regions of certain cricket boards in the country. And also some programs in the country as well.\nBerbice Cricket Board.\nThe Berbice cricket team played first class cricket in the Guystac Trophy and against the occasional touring team during the 20th century. The team came from the Dutch colony of Berbice, which is now a county of Guyana.\nThey played their inaugural first class match in March 1960 against the touring Marylebone Cricket Club from England. Berbice were captained by Joe Solomon who opened the batting and scored 201 not out which remained his highest first class score. Other notable players in the side included Basil Butcher who also scored a century, and Rohan Kanhai. In March 1961 they played a draw against EW Swanton's XI and didn't play a first class match again for another decade.\nDuring the 1970s and 80s the team played a match every season, bar one, against Demerara, with both sides playing for the Jones Cup and later the Guystac Trophy. The first match took place in October 1971 with Basil Butcher as captain. They played annually (except in 1980/81) until 1989 when they played each other for the final time. In 1980/81, Essequibo qualified for the Jones Cup final instead of Demerara. The inter-county tournament continued after 1989/90, but none of the matches were considered first class.\nBerbice won the Trophy in 1976/77, 1977/78 and 1980/81.\nThe first player from Berbice to play test cricket for the West Indies was John Trim, the fast bowler.\nDemerara Cricket Board.\nThe Demerara cricket team played first class cricket in the Jones Cup, later the Guystac Trophy, and came from the former British colony of Demerara, which is now a county of Guyana, formerly British Guiana. The other counties are Berbice and Essequibo.\nThey are credited as playing in the inaugural first class cricket match in the West Indies with a game against Barbados in 1865.\nDemerara were winners of the Jones Cup in 1972/73, and the Guystac Trophy in 1984/85, 1985/86 and 1989/90. Cricketers to have played for them include Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Lance Gibbs, Roger Harper, Carl Hooper and Ramnaresh Sarwan. The Jones Cup was the inter-county tournament in Guyana for many years until the name was changed to that of the new sponsors of the competition, Guystac. The final, only, was a first class match during the 1970s and 1980s.\nThe name Demerara was often used when referring to the whole of British Guiana in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, resulting in some confusion for students of cricket history. Before the 1950s, it was very unusual for a player from Berbice or Essequibo to be selected to play for British Guiana.\nEssequibo Cricket Board.\nThe inaugural president of the ECB was rice magnate Kayman Sankar, who established the Kayman Sankar Cricket Ground at Hampton Court with his own money. The Essequibo cricket team, historically the weakest of the three county sides, often played matches there, and appeared in the final of the 1980–81 Jones Cup inter-county competition, which was accorded first-class status.\nThe Guyana Blind Cricket Association.\nThe Organization was initiated by the Caribbean Council for the Blind/Eye Care Guyana with the ultimate aim of having the blind and visually impaired involved in normal life of society, through activities, which would help to build their confidence and self-esteem.\nThe Guyana Blind Cricket Association (GUYBCA) was launched on 31 March 2006.\nTo become a member of the West Indies Cricket Council for the Blind of which Barbados, Jamaica, Windward Islands and Trinidad &amp; Tobago were already members, Guyana had to host two countries and involve them in a Blind Cricket Match.\nTwo Cricket Coaches in the likes of Bharat Mangru of the Guyana Police Force and Roderick Lovell of the Guyana Defence Force were permitted by their respective Organizations to participate in the coaching clinic in Trinidad &amp; Tobago.\nGuyana sent a National team to Barbados in July 2006 to participate in the first regional Blind Cricket Competition, even though Guyana placed last, the performance of the team members were commendable, hence three of the players were selected to the West Indies Blind Cricket Team to participate in the Blind Cricket World Cup Competition in Pakistan in December 2006, they were Ganesh Singh, Oliver Kerr and Patrick Dillon, Bharat Mangru was also selected Coach for the West Indies Team.\nIn 2008 Guyana held a coaching clinic and trained five conventional cricket coaches in Guyana and also Anthony Gray of T&amp;T, two trained British Coaches conducted this five day program.\nIn 2007, the completion was held in Jamaica, but due to financial constraints Guyana was unable to participate, and in 2008 the completion was held in T&amp;T where Guyana placed third, two of our players were also selected to the West Indies Team to tour England in 2008 but again due to Financial constraints they were not able to travel with the team. In 2009 Ms. Theresa Pemberton, treasure of GUYBCA was elected Treasurer of the West Indies Cricket Council for the Blind and Mr. Ganesh was appointed Director, in 2009 Guyana also losing to Barbados, T&amp;T and Jamaica. (The players for the National Team came from Linden, East Coast, West Demerara, East Bank and Georgetown)\nOver the last two years some Executive members and the Blind and Visually Impaired cricketers were involved in Workshops and Seminars and Leadership programs; these were funded by VSO and GUYBCA.\nTwo of our young cricketers have just completed the JAWS computer program for the Blind.\nOur development program for 2008 involved Regions #2 Bartica, #5&amp;6 Berbice and #7 Essequibo\nThere are now two players from Essequibo, four from Berbice and one from Bartica.\nThe players are now practicing for the 5th Regional Competition which will be held in Barbados from 4 – 10 June 2010.\nThe Guyana Cricket Board is quite pleased with the progress made by the GUYBCA and the manner in which it is run.\nReferences.\nGuyana Cricket Board:Home\nWest Indies Fans Portal(Windiesfans.com) "

        "title": "San Francisco Dons men's basketball",
        "text": "The San Francisco Dons men's basketball team represents the University of San Francisco in NCAA Division I men's college basketball. The Dons compete in the West Coast Conference, where they have won sixteen regular season championships and one conference tournament championship. The current head coach is Chris Gerlufsen. They play home games at the War Memorial Gymnasium, which also serves as the venue for women's basketball, volleyball, athletic department offices, and athletic training rooms. Some games may be played at the Chase Center.\nThe basketball team claims three national titles: the 1949 NIT under Pete Newell, and the 1955 and 1956 NCAA Division I championships. The latter two were under Phil Woolpert, and led by player and National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Famer Bill Russell.\nUSF retained its status as a basketball powerhouse into the 1970s and early 1980s, holding the distinction of being a \"major\" program in a \"mid-major\" conference (the WCC having declined somewhat in stature since the 1960s). It held the number one spot in the polls on numerous occasions. In 1977, led by All-American center Bill Cartwright, the Dons started 29–0 and were regarded as the #1 team in the nation in both major polls before dropping their last two games.\nThe San Francisco Dons men's basketball program has been rated the 29th \"Greatest College Basketball Program of All-Time\" by \"Street &amp; Smith's\" magazine, 49th by NBC Sports \"Greatest Programs of All-Time\", and 75th by the ESPN/Sagarin All-Time College Basketball Rankings, higher in all three rankings than any other West Coast Conference school and many schools from BCS Conferences (Pac-12, Big Ten, Big 12, Big East, Southeastern Conference).\nHistory.\nBasketball got its start at USF, then known as St. Ignatius College, in 1910. The original coach was Orno Taylor, whose subsequent achievements were lost to history. The scores had grown since 1895 but the writing was as florid as ever. The College Annual reported that \"the entire team did nobly in the season just finished and the student body as a unit thanks them for their loyalty and devotion.\" The results weren't bad either. The St. Ignatius team won six of its seven games, losing only to Pacific (then located in San Jose) by a mere three points. Included in the victories was a sweep of Santa Clara, still a major rival, by scores of 38–31 and 22–13.\nPete Newell era.\nAfter serving in the United States Navy from 1942 to 1946, Pete Newell was appointed men's basketball head coach at the University of San Francisco in 1946. During his four-year tenure at USF, Newell compiled a 70–37 record and coached the Dons to the 1949 National Invitation Tournament (NIT) championship, beating Loyola (Chicago) 48-47. (At the time, the NIT was more prestigious than the NCAA Tournament.) This was the team of All-American Don Lofgran, Joe McNamee, captain John Benington, Ross Giudice, Frank Kuzara and a baby-faced guard named Rene Herrerias who often was thought to be the team's ball boy. New York's Madison Square Garden crowds were notoriously tough to please. Lofgran, Herrerias and company had them cheering in the aisles. In 1950, he accepted an appointment as head coach at Michigan State University, where he stayed until 1954. He later led the University of California to the 1959 NCAA men's basketball championship, and a year later coached the gold medal-winning U.S. team at the 1960 Summer Olympics. After his coaching career ended he ran a world-famous instructional basketball camp and served as a consultant and scout for several National Basketball Association (NBA) teams. He is often considered to be one of the most influential figures in the history of basketball.\nPhil Woolpert and the Russell era.\nNewell left for Michigan State in 1950, and USF hired Phil Woolpert as his successor. He assumed both the posts of men's basketball coach and athletic director.\nDuring his tenure at USF, Woolpert posted a 153–78 record, including a 60-game win streak that at the time was the longest in college basketball (surpassed later by John Wooden's 88 straight wins at UCLA.). His teams, anchored by Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Eugene Brown and Mike Farmer, were known for their defense and held opponents below 60 points on 47 different occasions. USF won the National Championship in 1955 and 1956, and finished third in 1957. At the time the youngest college basketball coach to win a national championship, Woolpert also won Coach of the Year honors in 1955 and 1956.\nBill Russell was ignored by major college scouts, largely because he didn't even start at McClymonds High School in Oakland. He did not receive a single letter of interest until Hal DeJulio from USF watched him in a high school game. DeJulio was not impressed by Russell's meager scoring and \"atrocious fundamentals\", but sensed that the young center had an extraordinary instinct for the game, especially in clutch situations. When DeJulio offered Russell a scholarship, the latter eagerly accepted. Sports journalist John Taylor described it as a watershed in Russell's life, because Russell realized that basketball was his one chance to escape poverty and racism; as a consequence, Russell swore to make the best of it.\nAt USF, Russell became the new starting center. Woolpert emphasized defense and deliberate half-court play, concepts that favored defensive standout Russell. Woolpert was unaffected by issues of skin color. In 1954, he became the first coach of a major college basketball squad to start three African American players: Russell, K.C. Jones and Hal Perry. In his USF years, Russell used his relative lack of bulk to develop a unique style of defense: instead of purely guarding the opposing center, he used his quickness and speed to play help defense against opposing forwards and aggressively challenge their shots. Combining the stature and shot-blocking skills of a center with the foot speed of a guard, Russell became the centerpiece of a USF team that soon became a force in college basketball. After USF kept Holy Cross star Tom Heinsohn scoreless in an entire half, \"Sports Illustrated\" wrote, \"If [Russell] ever learns to hit the basket, they're going to have to rewrite the rules.\"\nNonetheless, these games were often difficult for the USF squad. Russell and his African American teammates became targets of racist jeers, particularly on the road. In one notable incident, hotels in Oklahoma City refused to admit Russell and his black teammates while they were in town for the 1954 All-College Tournament. In protest, the whole team decided to camp out in a closed college dorm, which was later called an important bonding experience for the group. Decades later, Russell explained that his experiences hardened him against abuse of all kinds. \"I never permitted myself to be a victim,\" he said.\nOn the hardwood, his experiences were far more pleasant. Russell led USF to NCAA championships in 1955 and 1956, including a string of 55 consecutive victories. He became known for his strong defense and shot-blocking skills, once denying 13 shots in a game. UCLA coach John Wooden called Russell \"the greatest defensive man I've ever seen\". While at USF, together with K. C. Jones, he also helped pioneer a play that later became known as the alley-oop. During his college career, Russell averaged 20.7 points per game and 20.3 rebounds per game.\nBesides basketball, Russell represented USF in track and field events. He competed in the race, which he could complete in 49.6 seconds. He also participated in the high jump; \"Track &amp; Field News\" ranked him as the seventh-best high jumper in the world in 1956. That year, Russell won high jump titles at the Central California AAU meet, the Pacific AAU meet, and the West Coast Relays. One of his highest jumps occurred at the West Coast Relays, where he achieved a mark of .\nAfter his years at USF, the Harlem Globetrotters invited Russell to join their exhibition basketball squad. Russell, who was sensitive to any racial prejudice, was enraged by the fact that owner Abe Saperstein would only discuss the matter with Woolpert. While Saperstein spoke to Woolpert in a meeting, Globetrotters assistant coach Harry Hanna tried to entertain Russell with jokes. The USF center was livid after this snub and declined the offer: he reasoned that if Saperstein was too smart to speak with him, then he was too smart to play for Saperstein. Instead, Russell made himself eligible for the 1956 NBA draft.\nWoolpert stayed at USF for nine years. During his tenure, he was known for building national powers almost exclusively on Bay Area talent; the athletic department had virtually no recruiting budget and had little to offer out-of-state players.\n1960s and 1970s dominance.\nThe Dons remained as a powerhouse for several years after their 1950s run. The team added four more Elite Eight appearances to its resume: 1964, 1965, 1973, and 1974.\nUSF retained its status as a basketball powerhouse into the 1970s and early 1980s under Bob Gaillard and Dan Belluomini, holding the distinction of being a \"major\" program in a \"mid-major\" conference (the WCC's stature declined somewhat in the 1960s). Although John Wooden and his UCLA Bruins had eclipsed San Francisco as the premier West Coast power, the Dons remained an elite program well into the early 1980s. It held the number one spot in the polls on numerous occasions and six consecutive conference titles from 1977–82, and all but two WCC regular-season titles from 1972 to 1982. In 1977, led by All-American center Bill Cartwright, the Dons started the season 26–0 and were regarded as the #1 team in the nation in both major polls. Sports Illustrated highlighted the 1977 team with a cover story titled \"The Dandy Dons.\"\nNCAA violations and self-imposed death penalty.\nThe Dons remained an elite program well into the early 1980s, perennially ranked in the top 20, and captured six consecutive conference titles from 1977–82. San Francisco's success on the court came at a price, however. The NCAA placed the Dons on probation two times in the late 1970s for booster/alumni interference with the program and recruiting improprieties by coaches. Each NCAA investigation eventually led to the dismissal of a San Francisco head coach, leading \"San Francisco Chronicle\" sportswriter Glenn Dickey to call the program \"totally out of control.\" As a response to these incidents, school president Rev. John Lo Schiavo, S.J. a lifelong basketball enthusiast and all-city power forward in his youth, gave an ultimatum after the second NCAA case was resolved in 1980: if there was any further incident, the program would be shut down.\nDespite Lo Schiavo's warning, the improprieties continued. An exclusive invite-only booster organization called the Dons Century Club committed hundreds of thousands of dollars to illegal recruiting players, paying off family members, and covering travel expenses, while other alumni were also giving or \"lending\" players large sums of money, paying them for no-show jobs, providing lavish gifts, as well as picking up pricey restaurant and entertainment tabs. Basketball players continued to receive special academic treatment; many were marginal students at best, and at least one incident occurred in which a player threatened another student, and the incident was swept under the rug by school officials. It was also commonplace for \"tutors\" to take tests and write papers for players. The situation finally came to a head in December 1981, when All-American guard Quintin Dailey was found guilty of raping a female student. During the subsequent investigation, Dailey admitted taking a no-show job for $1,000 a month at a business owned by a prominent USF booster, and that another booster also paid Dailey $5,000 since 1980.\nTrue to his word, on July 29, 1982, Lo Schiavo announced that he was shutting down the basketball program—the first time a Division I university had voluntarily shut down a major sport under such circumstances. Lo Schiavo said that the Dons program \"was once a source of inspiration, respect and pride for this university and city.\" By contrast, the recent scandals had resulted in USF being perceived as \"being hypocritical or naïve or inept or duplicitous, or perhaps some combination of all those.\" Under the circumstances, Lo Schiavo felt that the only responsible course was to shutter the program. In a prepared statement, Lo Schiavo later said, \"We hope that it one day may be possible to restore a men's intercollegiate basketball team. That possibility will depend upon whether those responsible for this university are convinced that the factors that destroyed the program are not going to beset it again.\"\nHis decision made international headlines, to the degree that while visiting San Francisco, Queen Elizabeth II pulled Lo Schiavo aside to ask when he would reinstate the basketball program. Drastic as it was, the move was widely applauded by several members of the coaching fraternity.\nSan Francisco reinstated men's basketball in 1985, but without the overzealous Dons Century Club. The successor to the Dons Century Club is the Green and Gold Club, a group of boosters under the direct control of the athletic department.\nReinstatement of Dons basketball.\nLo Schiavo resurrected the program in 1985 with former star Jim Brovelli as head coach, who quickly returned the program to respectability. He was not able to reach the postseason, however, and resigned in 1995. Three years later USF went to the 1998 NCAA tournament under Phil Mathews and they had a 2005 NIT berth under former coach Jessie Evans.\nThe program regressed the next few years, and Jessie Evans was granted a request for a 'leave of absence' on December 27, 2007. Legendary basketball coach Eddie Sutton took over on an interim basis, needing two wins for a personal milestone of 800 career coaching victories. At the time, Bob Knight was the only other Division I men's coach to have accomplished the feat. After months of speculation, Evans was finally officially fired by USF on March 20, 2008. A national coaching search was launched that included a four-man committee of Chuck Smith, vice chair of the USF Board of Trustees and former president and CEO of AT&amp;T West; former player and coach Jim Brovelli; Walt Gmelch, dean of the USF School of Education; and Mario Prietto, rector of the USF Jesuit Community and a member of the USF Board of Trustees.\nOn March 29, 2008, USF hired an executive search consultant company, DHR International to help spearhead their efforts in hiring the next Dons' head coach. Among the possible candidates named, former UCLA Bruins Head Coach Steve Lavin, former USF All-American and current New Jersey Nets Assistant Coach Bill Cartwright, former NBA player and current Golden State Warriors Shooting Coach Sidney Moncrief, Cal Bears Assistant Head Coach Louis Reynaud, former Golden State Warriors and Sacramento Kings Head Coach Eric Musselman, and former Kansas Jayhawks All-American and FAU Head Coach Rex Walters.\nRex Walters was named as the Dons' head coach on April 14, 2008. In 2010, the USF Dons won over 20 games and went to the quarterfinals of the postseason CIT tournament. Walters was relieved of his duties on March 9, 2016, and replaced by Kyle Smith.\nAt the conclusion of the 2018–2019 season, Kyle Smith was hired by Washington State University after three consecutive 20-win seasons. Smith's Associate Head Coach Todd Golden was promoted to Head Men's Basketball Coach on March 27, 2019. Under Golden, the 2021-22 Dons returned to the NCAA tournament for the first time in 24 years. Golden departed after the season to coach Florida and was replaced by Chris Gerlufsen.\nThe Dons have never approached the prominence they enjoyed from the 1940s to the 1980s, in part because Lo Schiavo significantly increased admissions standards for all student-athletes. In a 2011 interview, Lo Schiavo reiterated that he never questioned his decision, noting that all but one trustee voted in favor of shuttering the program in 1982 \"because we had to make the point that we mean what we say and we intended to be good citizens.\"\nPostseason results.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Dons have appeared in 17 NCAA Tournaments.

        "text": "The men's 200 metres at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Olympic Stadium, Berlin, Germany on August 18 and August 20.\nThe race favourites were Tyson Gay and Usain Bolt. Gay entered the competition as the reigning world champion, championship record holder, and 200 m world leader with 19.58 seconds. Bolt, the current Olympic champion and world record holder, had a season's best of 19.59 seconds. The last time the two athletes raced was at the 2007 World Championships in Osaka, where Gay beat Bolt by a margin of 0.15 seconds. Osaka bronze medallist Wallace Spearmon was the only other athlete to run under twenty seconds that season and former Olympic champion Shawn Crawford was also competing. Up-and-coming athletes Alonso Edward, Steve Mullings and Ramil Guliyev were among the season's fastest sprinters prior to the championships.\nAfter hurting his groin during his American record run in the 100 metres two days earlier, Gay withdrew from the race, effectively rescinding his second world title. The withdrawal of Dwain Chambers, Churandy Martina and Jaysuma Saidy Ndure also reduced the quality of the field.\nThere were no surprise eliminations in the heats, where Crawford, Mullings, Robert Hering, and Martial Mbandjock were the fastest qualifiers, and Mullings had the fastest time of the quarter-finals round, with all the favourite athletes progressing. On the second day of competition, German number one Hering was eliminated. Bolt and Spearmon were the two semi-final winners, while the third-fastest, 19-year-old Alonso Edward, demonstrated medal winning form.\nIn the final race, Usain Bolt, the clear favourite, had another world record-breaking run following his 9.58 second record in the 100 metres four days earlier. After having the fastest reaction time of the race, Bolt came out of the bend in first place and extended his lead further in the home straight, beating his previous mark of 19.30 seconds set at the Olympics by 0.11 seconds to take the gold medal and Championship record. Crawford, second fastest at the bend, was overtaken by Edward and Spearmon and eventually finished fourth. Edward vastly improved his previous best to set a South American record of 19.81, while Spearmon was third with 19.85 seconds. At 19 years, 255 days old, silver medallist Edward became the youngest ever world medallist for the men's 200 m.\nAlthough the race between Gay and Bolt had not materialised, Bolt's world record of 19.19 seconds was a highlight of the championships. The overall quality of the event was also high: Edward had improved from 20.62 to 19.81 seconds over the course of one year. Also, with Crawford running 19.89 seconds, it was the first ever 200 m race to see four athletes run under 19.9 seconds. Bolt's winning margin of 0.62 seconds over second-placed Edward was the biggest in World Championship history. He received a $100,000 bonus for his performance, which was 0.13 seconds faster than Michael Johnson's former world record, a mark that had been regarded as one of the best records in the history of athletics.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the following records were as follows.\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 3 in each heat(Q) and the next 5 fastest(q) advance to the quarterfinals.\nQuarterfinals.\nQualification: First 3 in each heat(Q) and the next 4 fastest(q) advance to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nFirst 4 of each Semifinal will be directly qualified (Q) for the Finals."

The Wolfpack played their home games at Reynolds Coliseum in Raleigh, North Carolina, and competed as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. While losing only one game throughout the season, the team finished undefeated in the ACC conference lay, and went on to win the 1974 ACC men's basketball title. The Wolfpack then won the NCAA tournament, finishing the season as the national champions.\nSeason summary.\nNC State had several highly rated players, including star high-jumping forward David Thompson, 7-foot-4 center Tom Burleson, point guard Monte Towe, and several complementary players, including guard Moe Rivers and forward Phil Spence. The Wolfpack began the season ranked #2 in the nation, behind John Wooden's UCLA. On December 15, 1973, the two top-ranked teams met in St. Louis, with UCLA beating NC State by 84–66 after trailing by one at halftime. It would be the only loss for the Wolfpack that season. NC State later met and defeated the Bruins 80–77 in two overtimes in the NCAA tournament semi-final game, ending UCLA's streak of seven straight national championships.

        "text": "The 1982–83 NC State Wolfpack men's basketball team represented North Carolina State University. The Wolfpack were a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The team went 26–10 on the year, winning the ACC tournament and the NCAA National Championship.\nCinderella run.\nThe Wolfpack entered the season ranked in the Top 20 and entered conference play ranked #19 in the nation. Their second conference game was against Virginia, ranked #2 in the country at the time and undefeated against the Wolfpack's senior class. NC State took a lead early behind the shooting of guard and senior captain Dereck Whittenburg. Later in the game, though, Whittenburg was being guarded by Cavalier guard Othell Wilson on a jump shot and when Whittenburg came down, he landed with one foot on the floor and the other stepping on Wilson's foot. Whittenburg was taken off the court with what was later diagnosed as a broken foot.\nWith Whittenburg injured and facing significant time out, the Wolfpack struggled for the remainder of the regular season. While NC State won ten of the seventeen games that Whittenburg was sidelined with his injury, including a win against rival and defending national champion North Carolina, the seven losses they incurred left them with a 17-10 record entering the ACC Tournament.\nAt the time, the NCAA had a 52-team field for its annual tournament; the expansion took place just in time for the 1983 tournament, meaning that there were four extra spots available for potential qualifiers. While this did leave the potential for the Wolfpack to get into the tournament as an at-large if they did not win the ACC, a loss in the tournament would make eleven for the year and there would not be much room for error in an era prior to the expansion of the field to 64 teams.\nThus, the only sure thing for NC State would be to win the ACC Tournament outright, which would garner them the conference’s automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. They did just that, winning three games in the tournament to claim the title. The Wolfpack knocked off Wake Forest in the first game and North Carolina in the semifinals before recording their first victory over then-#2 Virginia in the finals.\nOn Selection Sunday, NC State found out it would be playing in the West Region of the tournament as the number six seed. This region presented the Wolfpack with a potentially difficult road to the Final Four, as its top three seeds were ranked in the top 10 in the final polls. Not only that, but the top seed in the region was their conference rival Virginia, which meant that the Wolfpack, should they both advance to the regional final, would have to find a way to beat the Cavaliers a second time.\nAt the time, the NCAA did not employ the “pod system” they use today to determine what teams play where to minimize travel costs and concerns for the first two rounds of the tournament. Instead, two venues per region were selected to host these games. In addition, since the field resulted in each region having an uneven number of teams (thirteen), the structure was different. The top four seeds in each region received byes into the second round of the tournament, and the teams seeded fifth and below played in the first round for the right to advance to face them (except for the team seeded twelfth, as that team would be determined in a game similar to the ones played in the modern tournament's First Four).\nNC State was sent to Corvallis, Oregon's Gill Coliseum for their sub-regional. The #6 seed Wolfpack would face the #11 seed in their first matchup, which was Jim Harrick’s West Coast Conference champion Pepperdine; the winner of that matchup would advance to play the region’s #3 seed, the 28-2 PCAA champion UNLV coached by Jerry Tarkanian, for the right to advance to the Sweet Sixteen phase of the tournament in Ogden, Utah at the Dee Events Center.\nTrailing late in the game against Pepperdine, the Wolfpack rallied to force overtime and then outlasted the Waves in a second overtime period to advance. There they rallied again against the favored UNLV squad to hand them only their third loss of the season and send the Wolfpack to the regionals.\nThe Wolfpack’s opponent in the regional semifinal was Western Athletic Conference champion Utah, who like NC State had entered the tournament needing to win their conference tournament to qualify as they had thirteen losses; led by coach Jerry Pimm, the #10 seed Utes defeated #7 seed Illinois and #2 seed UCLA in Boise.\nNC State easily defeated Utah to claim a spot in the regional final, with their nineteen-point margin of victory their biggest since their regular season finale against Wake Forest. This set up the Wolfpack’s fourth meeting of the year with Virginia, who toppled #4 seeded Boston College, led by future national championship winner Gary Williams, in the other regional semifinal. For the third time in four games, NC State emerged with a close victory, winning 63-62 after Virginia star Ralph Sampson missed a shot as time expired.\nAt the Final Four in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the Wolfpack finished off their run to the championship game by defeating Georgia in the semifinals on Saturday, which set up a matchup with top-ranked and heavily-favored Houston on Monday night at The Pit. During this run, N.C. State earned the nickname \"Cardiac Pack\" based in part on their \"Wolfpack\" mascot and the series of close games that took them to the title.\nFouling strategy.\nHead coach Jim Valvano was noted for employing a then-little used strategy late in games. The NCAA had yet to adopt a shot clock for college basketball, and as the games wore on some teams were just content to keep possession of the ball late in games to protect a lead, passing the ball around until the clock hit zero. Valvano would instruct his players to intentionally foul opposing players, thus putting them on the free-throw line. While this strategy was risky, as it allowed NC State's opponents a chance to increase their lead, it enabled the Wolfpack to extend the game as each foul stopped the clock and the team could also capitalize if the opponents missed their free throws. They used this to great effect in the ACC tournament, including against rival North Carolina and Virginia, and employed it again in four of their six NCAA victories. Nowhere was the strategy more widely seen, however, than in the national championship game.\nNational championship game.\nIn the final game on April 4 in Albuquerque, NC State led at halftime by a score of 33–25. Houston was hampered by foul trouble that plagued star Clyde Drexler, who picked up three fouls within the first few minutes. Drexler begged to remain in the game, but was forced to come out after Wolfpack sophomore guard Terry Gannon drew a charging foul on him. The foul was controversial as replays showed that Gannon appeared to grab Drexler's legs as he went down, and Drexler believed the foul should have gone against Gannon and not him (Gannon later said that Drexler never forgot the call; in the ESPN documentary about the team, he told his teammates that years later, by which time he had become a sports broadcaster, Gannon saw Drexler in the locker room at the 1991 NBA All-Star Game and once Drexler found out who he was he instantly cursed him out over the foul).\nIn the second half, the Cougars came out with a second wind and established control of the game. With Cougars coach Guy Lewis shifting his focus to getting center Hakeem Olajuwon the basketball on offense, using the advantage he had over NC State's big men Lorenzo Charles and Cozell McQueen, Houston outscored the Wolfpack 17–2 in the first ten minutes of the half to give themselves a 42–35 lead.\nHowever, things were not all good for Houston. Albuquerque is located in New Mexico's Sandia Mountains at a elevation. Thus, as is the case with other high-altitude cities, athletes are tested by the effects of the elevation as well as their own physical capabilities. One of the players most affected by the altitude change was Olajuwon, who had taken on an increased workload to try and get his team back in the game. Eventually, Coach Lewis had to take Olajuwon out of the game so he could take oxygen and recover. He then decided that in order to preserve his star center's health, the Cougars needed to start slowing the game down. Thus, he called for his \"Locomotion\" offensive set to be put into play. This meant that instead of driving to the basket every possession, Houston would pass the ball around to wind down the clock before passing to one of the designated scorers.\nThe move, however, failed for two reasons. One, it deviated from Houston's strength by abandoning their strategy of pushing the ball up the court. Second, it enabled Valvano to go to his fallback option of extending the game by fouling. Exacerbating the situation was the fact that Houston, as high powered offensively as it was, had not been a strong free-throw shooting team during the season. As such, the Wolfpack were able to both force the Cougars into mistakes and take advantage of the missed free throws to chip away at Houston's advantage. NC State outscored Houston 17–10 in the eight minutes that followed and tied the game at 52.\nOn what would be Houston's last possession, Valvano called for his defenders to sit back and let Cougars point guard Alvin Franklin advance the ball and begin passing it around. Lewis wanted to keep the ball in the hands of Drexler and sophomore forward Reid Gettys, his two best foul shooters, to try and force them to foul either one of those two players and for anyone else to quickly give it up once they had the ball. Valvano instead wanted Franklin, a freshman, to take the shots and instructed his players to foul him once he got the ball back. Franklin received the ball with 1:05 left but instead of immediately passing it, as he had done already on the play, he held the ball for an additional second. Wolfpack senior point guard Dereck Whittenburg took advantage of Franklin's momentary lapse in concentration and committed the foul to send Franklin, a 63% free throw shooter, to the line for a one-and-one. The idea, as later stated by Whittenburg and fellow senior Thurl Bailey years later, was to not only put a poor foul shooter on the line but force Franklin, as the youngest starter on the squad, to face the enormousness of the moment with a sellout crowd at The Pit and millions of viewers watching at home. Whatever the idea may have ultimately been, it worked as Franklin missed the shot. NC State took the rebound and with 44 seconds on the clock, Valvano called a time out and drew up a final play for his point guard Whittenburg to take the last shot.\nHouston, meanwhile, needed a defensive stop to extend the game. Lewis decided to move from the man-to-man defense his team had been running the whole game to a half court trap with Benny Anders as the point man, with the goal being to force NC State to spread the ball around and force a turnover. The Wolfpack, who were not expecting the defensive adjustment, were forced to deviate and began passing the ball around just to keep the Cougars from stealing it. Houston nearly got the turnover it was looking for when Whittenburg made an errant pass to Gannon that Drexler nearly came away with before the sophomore regained control. The ball eventually found its way to Sidney Lowe, who found Bailey standing in the lower left-hand corner of the court and passed it his way so he could take the shot. Bailey, however, wanted no part of Lowe's idea as he had not had a good half shooting the ball and began looking back toward Whittenburg. With a pair of defenders on him, Bailey threw what his teammate later called a \"poor fundamental\" overhand pass that Anders could easily have stolen.\nAt that moment Whittenburg harkened back to his high school days with Morgan Wootten at DeMatha Catholic High School in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C. One thing Wootten always taught his players was that when receiving the ball, bring it in with both hands. As Anders went for the ball, Whittenburg was able to put that lesson to use and by getting his other hand on the ball, he was able to get more control of it and prevent Anders from knocking it away. Anders was only able to get his fingertips on the ball, which temporarily stripped the ball from Whittenburg but did not enable him to take it away. Had Anders been able to steal, he would have likely had an uncontested breakaway to the other end of the court where he could have easily dunked the ball and given the Cougars the lead. Since the rules of the day dictated that the entire game be played with a running clock, the Wolfpack would most likely not have been able to get the ball up the court in time for a potential tying shot.\nWhen Whittenburg regained control, five seconds were showing on the clock and he turned to try to get some sort of shot off from his position thirty-five feet from the goal. While the shot was in line with the basket, Whittenburg had not gotten enough on it and the ball was going to come up well short. At the foot of the goal stood Olajuwon and Wolfpack center Lorenzo Charles, who watched Whittenburg's air ball. Olajuwon hesitated briefly, as he was in position to grab the ball and likely force overtime but did not want to jump too soon and be called for goaltending. Charles took advantage of the hesitation and went up for the errant shot. With two seconds left on the clock Charles took the ball and drove it through the hoop with two hands for the decisive score and gave the Wolfpack its first national championship since 1974.\n\"30 for 30\".\nThe team's story was chronicled in \"Survive and Advance\", an episode in the ESPN \"30 for 30\" series. Dereck Whittenburg produced the documentary and was one of several players who appeared in it, alongside his teammates Thurl Bailey, Sidney Lowe, Terry Gannon, Cozell McQueen, and Ernie Myers. Valvano's widow, Pam Valvano Strasser, also appears in the documentary as do several of his assistants. Hakeem Olajuwon, David Rose, and Reid Gettys of the defeated Houston squad also appear to offer their take on their loss, as do then-North Carolina assistant Roy Williams and then-Pepperdine coach Jim Harrick, whose teams were defeated in the ACC and NCAA tournaments by the Wolfpack. Mike Krzyzewski is also featured prominently in the film, describing how his relationship with Valvano (who started at NC State the same year Krzyzewski took over at Duke) evolved over the years from an adversarial one to one where the two men became close friends.\nIn addition to the 1982–83 team's season (and their 30-year reunion, which is marked by the absence of the recently deceased Lorenzo Charles), Valvano's career after that season is a major focal point, including the scandal that led to his resignation from NC State in 1990.\nThe emotional impact Valvano's cancer diagnosis had on his players and coaches is also heavily featured. In addition to Valvano's famous speech at the 1993 ESPY Awards, special attention is paid to his appearance at the ceremony honoring the 1982–83 team held several weeks earlier. Valvano had not been expected to attend, partly due to his illness but also to lingering bad feelings present from his forced resignation three years earlier. However, in what would prove to be the last time many of his players would see him, Valvano made his appearance toward the end of the ceremony and spoke to the crowd about how the team never gave up and how it inspired him to continue his fight against cancer.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#E00000; color:white;\"| ACC Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#E00000; color:white;\"| NCAA Tournament"

        "title": "Cycling in Cardiff",
        "text": "Cycling in Cardiff, capital of Wales, is facilitated by its easy gradients and large parks. In the mid-2000s between 2.7% and 4.3% of people commuted to work by cycling in the city. In 2017 12.4% of workers cycled to work at least 5 days a week. However, cyclists in the city are deterred from cycling by poor facilities and aggressive traffic, according to research by Cardiff University.\nAs the busiest city, Cardiff is statistically the most dangerous place to cycle in Wales. Between 1999 and 2008, 1,000 cyclists were injured on the road, 20% of all cycling accidents in Wales, although the number of injuries to cyclists continues to fall.\nThe Cardiff cycle network is over long with an additional completed each year.\nCouncil policy.\nAccording to their Cycling Strategy (see below), Cardiff County Council aims to encourage citizens to cycle more, citing the improved health through increased fitness, reduced pollution and congestion of the local environment, economic gains through cycle tourism and leisure, independence for those people who cannot or do not wish to use a car, and the fact that cycling can be the quickest and most convenient form of transport in urban areas such as Cardiff. In 2002 they appointed a full-time Cycling Officer.\nThe council's Transport, Infrastructure and Waste service aims to ensure that an increase in cycling is matched with a reduction in the number of collisions involving cyclists.\nCardiff Council also provides off-road cycle training for school pupils to develop basic cycling skills based upon the National Cycling Proficiency Scheme. Training covers the Highway Code, negotiating obstacles, turning left and right, emergency stops and basic cycle maintenance. More than 1,500 children participate in this course every year in Cardiff, according to the council's Cycling Strategy.\nThe council produces a free map of the city, available from its offices or from cycle shops, highlighting cycle paths, lanes and suggested cycle routes.\nStrategy.\nThe council's Cycling Strategy was adopted in 1998. The 2007 update showed that 2.7% of people living in Cardiff cycled to work in 2001, an increase from 2.6% in 1991. However, an Omnibus survey showed that in 2003 and 2005, 3.6% and 4.3% of people cycled to work respectively. Although, the number of children cycling to school fell from 5% to 2% since 1989–91. In the strategy, the council intends to:\nCycleways.\nCardiff Council are in the process of developing 5 cycleways across the city. This falls in line with its strategy to provide far more segregation from motorised traffic for cyclists.\nWhile work on the routes has already broken ground, some have criticised both certain design flaws and how long it is taking for consultations to be published, with only two published within as many years. While some routes are essentially brand new, others are facelifts or changes of priority for current routes, such as Cycleway 3 on Lloyd George Avenue, and Cycleway 2 on Newport Road.\nThe proposed Cycleway routes are:\nCycle facilities.\nCycle Shops.\nThe 2011 Cardiff Council cycle map listed 12 cycle shops (down from 14 in 2009) in the city: in Canton, Cathays (Crwys Road), Cathays (Woodville Road), Gabalfa, Grangetown, Llandaff North, Llanrumney, Pontcanna, Rhiwbina, Roath (Broadway), Roath (Newport Road) and Whitchurch. Braddicks on Broadway, Roath, closed in January 2015 after 70 years trading.\nCycle lanes.\nSome roads in the city provide distinct cycle lanes to the left of the vehicle lane. According to the Cardiff Cycle Map, these include:\nBus and cycle lanes.\nThere are also lanes that cyclists share with buses, motorcycles and taxis, in which it is illegal to drive on in any other motor vehicle. Such lanes are on:\nSegregated / off-road cycle paths.\nSegregated cycle facilities can be a shared pavement with pedestrians, running alongside a road or through a park for example. This is denoted by a blue circular sign showing a bicycle and pedestrians. A cycle only route is denoted by blue circular sign showing only a bicycle. Much of the \"Taff Trail, Ely Trail\" and \"Rumney Trail\" are segregated from traffic. Other such routes in the city include:\nCycle parking.\nThere are bicycle stands for parking in locations including the following:\nCycle hire.\nPedal Power is a charity with their main bike centre in Pontcanna offering cycle hire facilities. Cycle training and cycle assessments are also available.\nOYBike.\nIn March 2009 the Welsh Assembly Government and Cardiff Council announced plans to introduce a free cycle hire scheme, with bike racks placed around the city, allowing people to pick up bikes and ride them to another point, where they would leave the bike. Money would also be put into creating more strategic cycle routes and cycle lanes. The system, similar to those in other large cities, launched in September 2009, and included 70 bikes and 35 hire points (initially 7) around the centre and the south of the city. The stations (in 2010) were: Central Station; Cardiff Castle; Central Library; Queen Street Station; Churchill Way; City Hall; eastern Queen Street; Cardiff Bay Station; County Hall; and Cardiff Bay Visitors’ Centre. It was necessary to register before using a bike. The first half an hour was free after which a small hourly fee was payable. The scheme, which was part of a £28.5 million plan to encourage residents in the capital to use sustainable transport and ease congestion, was welcomed by campaigners.\nThe cycle scheme run by OYBike ended in December 2011 after funding was removed by Cardiff council; the operator did not have other sponsors so the bikes along with their smart locks were removed from the city centre.\nNextbike.\nIn June 2017 Nextbike was announced as the new provider of a public bike hire scheme for Cardiff. This would integrate new technology into the bikes, rather than the docking stations. Fifty bikes went 'live' in March 2018, with an official launch in May 2018 when the numbers would increase to 250. The bikes could be rented via a website, a telephone hotline, or by downloading a mobile app. Standard charges were £1 for every half hour period. Annual subscriptions were also available. Almost 7,800 people were registered for the scheme by June 2018. Nextbike has been both popular and successful, with Cardiff Council backing the scheme.\nNextbike has begun to introduced electric bikes across Cardiff, where users can rent and return electric bikes.\nIn 2021 Nextbike secured a sponsorship deal with OVO.\nCycle refurbishment.\nCardiff Cycle Workshop, a bike workshop launched in July 2010 in Ely, refurbishes and repairs unwanted cycles, saving old bikes from the landfill and revitalises them for new owners at cheaper prices. Cardiff Cycle Workshop has an agreement with Cardiff Council for cages to be placed in the waste facilities in Fairwater and Grangetown for members of the public to leave their unwanted bicycles. Then the bikes are refurbished, checked for safety and have parts replaced. The bikes are then sold for anything from £10 to £150. Three year funding has come from the Big Lottery Fund.\nCycling routes.\nCross city north cycleway.\nCross city north cycleway began as a temporary cycleway along Cowbridge Road East, North Road, Boulevard de Nantes, Dumfries Place, and Newport Road. This runs around the city centre, connecting to cycleway 1, cycleway 4, and the Taff Trail. It will eventually also connect to cycleway 2 and cycleway 5.\nCycleway 1.\nCycleway 1 is a bidirectional cycle track under development. It will eventually link the city centre to the suburb of Lisvane, with connections to the University Hospital of Wales, Heath High Level railway station, and Heath Low Level railway station. As of 2021, a section on Senghenydd Road had been completed, with construction under way on an extension to the University Hospital of Wales, costing £6,000,000. In 2023, that section was completed.\nCycleway 4.\nCycleway 4 is a bidirectional cycle track. It will eventually link the city centre to Llandaff, Danescourt, and Plasdwr. As of 2021, a section in Sophia Gardens has been completed, with consultations ongoing for an extension to Llandaff.\nEly Trail.\nThe off-road \"Ely Trail\" is under development in the west and south of the city as of 2010, funded by the County Council, Visit Wales, and Countryside Council for Wales. So far completed is the northern section through St Fagans, Fairwater and Ely, and the southern section running from Leckwith to the south along the River Ely through Grangetown, finishing at the Cardiff International Sports Village. However, these sections are yet to be connected.\nThe route is connected to Cardiff City Centre via an off-road north-south route through Butetown. The \"Taff Trail\" at Cardiff Bay can also be joined from the trail via Grangetown and Butetown.\nLlys Tal-Y-Bont Cycleway.\nThe Llys Tal-Y-Bont Cycleway is a bidirectional cycle track approximately 0.5km long. It runs from a connection with the Taff Trail and the North Road Cycleway to the Excelsior Industrial Estate, with a connection to a bike park. Originally, this route was a 2m wide shared path, but work in 2020 upgraded it to a 2m wide path for pedestrians and a 4m wide separate path for cyclists. This also makes use of an existing underpass under Eastern Avenue.\nNorth Road Cycleway.\nThe North Road Cycleway runs from the city centre to Birchgrove. Upgrade work on an existing route began in 2018, and a 2020 upgrade to a large section of the cycleway means that it is both off-road for nearly all of its length and has a maximum width of 4 metres. The cycleway is separated from pedestrians for the newer section near the city centre. The route has been criticised for being too close to trees for much of the route, potentially leading to increased leaf litter.\nRhymney Trail.\nThe off-road \"Rhymney Trail\" is being developed by the Council as a commuting and recreational route along the Rhymney River in the east of the city. Currently completed is the section between Llanedeyrn and Rumney. The Cardiff Cycle Map shows the route running off-road from Llanedeyrn Interchange, bypassing Llanrumney to the west, briefly joining Newport Road (B4487), and then heading south of Rumney to Wentloog Avenue (B4239). However, an off-road section also runs north-south through Pentwyn from Llanedeyrn.\nTaff Trail.\nThe 55-mile long \"Taff Trail\" runs from Cardiff Bay through Pontypridd and Merthyr Tydfil to Brecon, forming part of the \"Lôn Las Cymru\" – the National Cycle Network \"Route 8\" to Holyhead.\nThe route begins at Roald Dahl Plass in Cardiff Bay and runs mostly off-road through the city for north around Grangetown and the City Centre, joining the River Taff in Bute Park before heading north-west through Llandaff and Radyr, leaving the city at Tongwynlais.\nRoute 88: Coastal route.\nNational Cycle Route 88 is a coastal cycle route being constructed from Newport to Margam Country Park, Bridgend, via Cardiff.\nPont y Werin.\nPont y Werin (Welsh for \"The People's Bridge\") is a pedestrian and cyclist bridge spanning the River Ely between Cardiff Bay and Penarth. This forms a key part of Route 88. Costing approximately £4.5 million, Pont y Werin crosses between the Cardiff International Sports Village and Penarth, allowing the public to travel to the Sports Village via Cogan railway station.\nOpened on 14 July 2010, the bascule bridge completes the Cardiff Bay circular walk and cycle route, and incorporates a 20-metre opening section to allow river traffic to pass. The whole bridge is a shared space for pedestrians and cyclists, and is not wide enough for segregation.\nPenarth.\nIn 2010 it was announced a commuter route for cyclists would be installed, aiming to improve transport links between Penarth and Cardiff Bay.\nIntegration.\nCardiff rail network.\nCycling is integrated into the city's urban rail network, which is operated by Transport for Wales Rail. Most trains have spaces for two cycles. However they are not permitted on services from Caerphilly, Radyr (except the City Line), Cadoxton, and Ebbw Vale Town to Cardiff Queen Street or Cardiff Central between 07:00 and 09:30, or services in the reverse direction 16:00 to 18:00 on weekdays. Outside these times, carriage is still at the discretion of the guard. Folding cycles can be carried folded-up at any time.\nThere is cycle storage at Cardiff Central station on all platforms, at the front and rear entrances to the station, and in the Riverside car park.\nNational rail network.\nCycles are also permitted free of charge on the wider national network provided they can be safely stored in the designated areas and reservations through the train operator are recommended. Bikes must be carried in the designated area of the train and can't be stored in aisles or vestibule areas. Cycles can not be carried on rail-replacement coach services. Folding bikes can be carried at all times as normal hand luggage.\nTransport for Wales also operates most of the Welsh rail network and its cycle policies apply to other services as well without the restrictions applied to the Cardiff rail network.\nBuses.\nCycles can not be carried on bus services in Cardiff. However, a \"Beacons Bus\" runs on Sundays and Bank Holidays in summer to Brecon which tows a cycle trailer to carry cycles. Efforts have been made to ensure there is bike parking next to bus stops.\nCycling Campaigns in Cardiff.\nSustrans Cymru.\nSustrans is a UK sustainable transport charity that constructs safe cycle routes and other inititiatives to encourage people to walk or cycle. Their \"Valleys Cycle Network\" project aims to add 100 miles of vehicle-free routes in the Valleys of South Wales.\nIn September 2011 it was announced that Sustrans Cymru were launching a new project in Cardiff funded by the Wales Government. This involved offering expert consultation to Cardiff householders to draw up personal travel plans, designed to reduce car journeys and encourage, amongst other things, increased use of bicycles.\nCardiff Cycling Campaign.\nThe \"Cardiff Cycling Campaign\" campaigns for better provisions for cyclists in the city, believing that the council's attitude is inadequate. While it welcomes the Council's commitment to consider the needs of cyclists, it argues that these should not be marginal in relation to the management of cars and buses. A sea-change in thinking is required and available Council funds need to be used imaginatively to create 'coherent and continuous routes' through the city for cyclists. For example, safe cycling routes through the city centre were lost with the construction of the new St Davids 2 shopping centre.\nIn April 2006 the Campaign pointed out that only 2.7% of people cycled to work in Cardiff. Campaigners cycled through Cardiff city centre during a rush hour period, accompanied by local councillors and a Welsh Assembly Member. A participating councillor was quoted as saying 'I was happy to rise to the challenge but at times it was frightening. The cycle lanes were sometimes inadequate and complicated, and if I hadn't been with the campaign I probably would have got lost'.\nCycle Cardiff.\n\"Cycle Cardiff\" aims to raise awareness of cycling and organises bike rides in and around the city.\nWorld Naked Bike Ride.\nThe \"Cardiff World Naked Bike Ride\" has taken place annually since 2008. This is part of a globally coordinated World Naked Bike Ride, designed to highlight the vulnerability of cyclists on the road and campaign for better cycling facilities. In June 2011 80 cyclists reportedly took part riding through the centre of Cardiff, many of them naked."

        "title": "Illinois High School Boys Basketball Championship",
        "text": "The Illinois High School Boys Basketball Championship is a single elimination tournament held each spring in the United States. It is organized by the Illinois High School Association (IHSA).\nFrom 1908 to 1971, it was a single tournament contested by nearly all high schools in Illinois. In 1972, the tournament was divided into two divisions based on school size, (A and AA), each producing a separate champion. In 2008, the tournament was divided into four separate divisions (1A, 2A, 3A, and 4A being the larger schools). The Illinois High School Basketball Championship was the first tournament to be called 'March Madness'. The term was first used about the Illinois tournament in 1939, decades before it was used about NCAA basketball tournament.\nAdvancement.\nUnder the current four class system, teams are assigned to a class, based on the student population, with adjustments made for single gender schools, and for schools which are not four year high schools. Within the class, schools are geographically assigned to a regional, which is, in turn assigned to a sectional which, finally, is assigned to a super-sectional. Regional tournaments are generally between four and eight teams, depending on the number of teams in a geographic area in a particular class. There are four regional tournaments within each sectional and two sectionals within each super-sectional. Each tournament is single elimination.\nWithin the regional, coaches seed the teams. The winners of the four regional tournaments then meet in a single elimination sectional tournament. The teams are not re-seeded after regional play, and the winners of the regional tournament are randomly assigned, in advance, to play the winner of one of the other regionals in the sectional semifinals.\nFor example, in 2011, in the Class 2A Casey Sectional, there were four regionals: Flora, Monticello, St. Joseph and Robinson. Three of these regionals consisted of five teams and one of six. Before the playoffs began, the IHSA assigned the winner of the Flora Regional (which ended up being Teutopolis) to play the winner of the Monticello Regional (Champaign St. Thomas). The winners of the St. Joseph and Robinson regionals played in the other regional semifinal, with the winners of the two semifinals met in the sectional championship.\nThe winner of the sectional tournament then faces the winner of another (geographically close) sectional champion for the super-sectional championship. This winner advances to the state tournament.\nThe state tournament in each class is composed of the four super-sectional winners, and are randomly assigned to play each other in the semifinal round. The winners of the semifinal round compete for the state championship the next evening, while the semifinal losers compete for third place the next day. The state semifinals are generally held on a Friday, with the championship and third place games held on Saturday. Classes 1A and 2A share the same weekend, while 3A and 4A compete the weekend after that.\nUnder the current four class system, each class has four super sectional games, and thus 8 sectionals. Each sectional has four regionals, giving each class 32 regional tournaments.\nThe format in the two class system (1972–2007) was similar. In the two class system, each class had 8 super-sectional games, and thus 16 sectionals and 64 regionals. The winners of the 8 super-sectional games advanced to the state tournament. On the Friday of the state tournament, the 8 winners were randomly assigned to play each other in a quarterfinal game. The winners advanced to the semifinals, which were played on the next day. The semifinal losers played for third place in the early evening, while the semifinal winners contested the state championship in the evening. Class A would play one weekend, and Class AA the next weekend.\nPrior to 1972, when there was only one tournament for all schools to compete in, there were a variety of formats in use.\nThe IHSA Girls Basketball tournament is organized in exactly the same way as the boys' tournament; however, the girls' tournament begins two weeks before the boys' tournament.\nSites.\nThe tournament was originally organized only with the permission of the IHSA, but after one year was taken over by the Association. The tournament spent 77 years playing at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (UIUC) before moving to Bradley University's Carver Arena in Peoria from 1996-2019. The 2020 tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and on June 15, 2020, the IHSA announced the tournament would move back to UIUC's State Farm Center.\nAdditional events.\nThe Happening.\nIn 1992, the IHSA added a three-point contest and a slam dunk contest (collectively called \"The Happening\") to coincide with the boys basketball state series. The state level of each contest is held on the Thursday evening before their respective class' state semifinals (quarterfinals before 2008), with each class crowning a champion in each contest on the Saturday of their state championship game. After the Class 3A and 4A champions have been determined, there is a final \"King of the Hill\" contest among the four class champion to crown the overall champion.\nThe slam dunk contest has no preliminaries prior to the Thursday competition of the week of the state finals. Players are nominated by the coaches of their regional or sectional tournament. Those willing to participate advance automatically to the state preliminaries.\nThe three point contest starts at the beginning of the regional tournaments. Each team may select up to 4 players to compete, with a total of four players advancing to the next level of competition. As teams advance through regional and sectional, the winning individuals advance, irrespective of their team's success.\nMarch Madness Experience.\nSince 1996, in addition to the on court activities, the IHSA has set up an interactive event at the Peoria Civic Center called the March Madness Experience. Set up in the Exhibit Hall, the \"Experience\" includes interactive games and skill challenges for fans to participate in. Big screen televisions allow fans to watch the current game being played on the court, and radio and television broadcasts originate from the floor. The \"Experience\" opens on the Thursday of each week of the State Championship Tournament, and remains open throughout the tournament.\nWheelchair Basketball.\nStarting in 2004, the first weekend of the State Championship Tournament also hosts the state high school championship for wheelchair basketball. The tournament is a round robin tournament, and is composed of teams of high school students, though the teams are not necessarily affiliated with a particular school.\nCentury of Memories.\nThe IHSA celebrated 100 years of the IHSA State Tournament in the 2006-07 season. A list of \"100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament\" was assembled. Several of the living members of that team made appearances at select games across the state, and signed a \"Ball of Fame\" which was subsequently raffled off at the state tournament. Commemorative books and videos were available. Among the notable members of the \"Legends\" team were Kenny Battle, Lou Boudreau, Jim Brewer, Quinn Buckner, Landon \"Sonny\" Cox, Bruce Douglas, Dwight \"Dike\" Eddleman, LaPhonso Ellis, Melvin Ely, Michael Finley, C. J. Kupec, Marcus Liberty, Shaun Livingston, Cuonzo Martin, Johnny Orr, Andy Phillip, Quentin Richardson, Dave Robisch, Cazzie Russell, Jon Scheyer, Jack Sikma, Isiah Thomas, Frank Williams, and George Wilson.\nState title forfeiture.\nThe 2005 Class A state title resulted in the only forfeiture of a state boys basketball title in Illinois history. The title game resulted in a victory for Chicago's Hales Franciscan High School over Winnebago. It was the second year in a row Winnebago had lost in the final game, and was the second time in three years that Hales Franciscan had won.\nHales Franciscan's basketball team had been at the center of problems for over a year. In 2004, the school had been kicked out of the IHSA state series when recruiting violations had been uncovered.\nIn November, 2005, the IHSA announced that it was suspending Hales Franciscan's membership in the Association, when it was learned that the school's Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) recognition had been lapsed in June, 2003.\nIn January, 2006, the IHSA announced that due to the lack of recognition (ISBE), Hales Franciscan would forfeit all athletic contests played between June, 2003 and December, 2005, including its 2005 State Championship.\nReferences.\nAlso see John Pruett (Illinois High School Career Field Goal Percentage Champion)"

        "title": "Kirk Gibson's 1988 World Series home run",
        "text": "Kirk Gibson's 1988 World Series home run was a baseball play that occurred in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series, on October 15, 1988, at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. Gibson was initially held out of the Los Angeles Dodgers' lineup with injuries to both legs, but after being called upon to pinch hit in the bottom of the ninth inning with two outs, he hit a two-run, walk-off home run against Oakland Athletics pitcher Dennis Eckersley. The home run won the game for the Dodgers by a score of 5–4.\nAfter winning the National League (NL) West division, the Dodgers were considered the underdogs throughout the 1988 postseason, first to the New York Mets in the NL Championship Series, then to the Athletics in the World Series. Gibson, who was not expected to play due to injuries in both legs sustained during the NLCS, was surprisingly inserted as a pinch hitter with the Dodgers trailing 4–3 with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning and the tying run at first base. Gibson's home run—his only plate appearance of the series—helped the Dodgers defeat the Athletics, four games to one, securing their sixth World Series title.\nThe play has since become legendary in the baseball world, and is regarded as one of the greatest home runs of all time. It was voted the \"greatest moment in L.A. sports history\" in a 1995 poll. Many of the images associated with the home run, particularly Gibson pumping his fist while circling the bases, are often shown in classic highlight reels, usually accompanied by play-by-play from broadcasters Vin Scully or Jack Buck. Though not related to his World Series home run, Gibson would be named the 1988 NL Most Valuable Player.\nBackground.\nRegular season.\nThe Dodgers signed outfielder Kirk Gibson as a free agent during the 1987-88 offseason. Gibson, who played the previous nine seasons with the Detroit Tigers (winning a World Series title with them in 1984), quickly became the Dodgers' de facto leader both on the field and off. On the field, Gibson led the team with 25 home runs, a .290 batting average and 31 stolen bases.\nThe Dodgers, who had only finished 4th in the National League West in 1987 with a 73–89 () record (17 games behind the division winning San Francisco Giants), led the NL West division standings from late May until the end of the season, easily winning the division title with a record of 94–67 (), seven games ahead of the second-place Cincinnati Reds.\nOne reason why the Dodgers were considered underdogs throughout the postseason was that they did not finish the regular season ranked in the top five of any major offensive statistical category. However, they were strengthened by an excellent starting rotation led by ace Orel Hershiser and backed up by Tim Belcher, John Tudor and Tim Leary. They also had an outstanding bullpen that included Jay Howell, Jesse Orosco and Alejandro Peña.\nPostseason.\nTheir opponent in the National League Championship Series was the New York Mets, who had compiled a more impressive 100–60 () regular season record, and had won 10 of their 11 regular-season meetings with the Dodgers. The NLCS was a surprisingly close contest given the outcomes of the two teams' regular season meetings. Gibson's heroics in the series included an improbable catch on wet grass in Game 3 and decisive home runs in Games 4 and 5. The series went to a deciding Game 7, which the Dodgers won in stunning fashion on the back of Hershiser's 5 hit shutout to earn their first World Series trip since 1981. Gibson injured his left hamstring while stealing second base in Game 5 and his right knee while sliding into second base in Game 7.\nAfter defeating the Mets, the Dodgers faced the Oakland Athletics in the World Series. Oakland had compiled a 104–58 () regular season record (the best in the Majors), and boasted a powerful lineup led by sluggers Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire, and complemented by the likes of Dave Henderson, Dave Parker and Don Baylor. The A's, who also boasted 20-game winner Dave Stewart (himself a former Dodger from 1978 to 1983) and closer Dennis Eckersley who had saved 45 games during the regular season, had easily accounted for Boston in the ALCS, sweeping the Red Sox 4–0.\nThe setup.\nWorld Series Game 1.\nGibson injured both legs during the NLCS, and therefore did not start Game 1. Los Angeles took an early lead on an improbable two-run home run by Mickey Hatcher in the first inning. The next inning, however, Canseco hit a grand slam to give Oakland a two-run lead. Oakland's lead was cut to one run when Mike Scioscia hit an RBI single in the sixth inning that scored Mike Marshall.\nUnknown to the fans and the media at the time, Gibson was watching the game on television while undergoing physical therapy in the Dodgers' clubhouse. At some point during the game, television cameras scanned the Dodgers dugout and commentator Vin Scully, working for NBC for the 1988 postseason, observed that Gibson was \"nowhere to be found\". This spurred Gibson to tell Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda that he was available to pinch hit. Gibson immediately returned to the batting cage in the clubhouse to take practice swings.\nWith a one-run lead, Oakland closer and future Hall of Famer Dennis Eckersley, who led the AL with 45 saves during the regular season, was brought in to close out the game and seal the win for starter Dave Stewart. Eckersley quickly got Scioscia to pop out to shortstop and struck out Jeff Hamilton. Left-handed pinch hitter Mike Davis followed; if he got on base the next batter due was the pitcher's spot, which would certainly be filled with a pinch hitter. Not wanting the A's to realize that Gibson was available, Lasorda sent Dave Anderson to the on-deck circle during Davis' plate appearance. According to Lasorda, A's catcher Ron Hassey got Eckersley's attention and pointed at Anderson on-deck. The popular story is that Eckersley pitched around Davis because the A's thought that the light-hitting Anderson was the next batter. Hassey vehemently denied that the A's pitched carefully to Davis because Anderson was on deck: \"Why would we pitch around Davis when we have two outs? You don't pitch around a guy with two outs to face another hitter. That would never make sense. You have your closer out there. That's just not true. That's a good story. As far as I know, Gibson is on the roster. Is he not? You're not going to waste a guy that can't play. He's active.\" Eckersley decided to pitch around Davis because he had seen him hit 20 home runs for the A's before the All-Star break the previous year. Instead of risking making a mistake that Davis could hit for a game-tying home run, Eckersley pitched carefully and did in fact walk him.\nThe play.\nInstead of sending Anderson to the plate, Lasorda inserted Gibson as his pinch hitter. Gibson hobbled up to the plate with Scully commenting, \"And look who's coming up!\" Gibson quickly fouled off two pitches, getting behind in the count, 0–2. He then swung clumsily and dribbled the ensuing pitch foul down the first base line, which seemed to confirm his inability to swing with any authority. Gibson took an outside pitch, called a ball by home plate umpire Doug Harvey, fouled off a pitch, and then took another outside pitch to work to a 2–2 count.\nOn the seventh pitch of the at bat—another ball, making it a full count—Davis stole second. Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda later recounted it was pre-planned that if the count got to two strikes on Gibson, they would have Davis steal second, figuring that A's manager Tony La Russa would not elect to intentionally walk Gibson if there were already two strikes against him. Once Davis was at second, Lasorda was just hoping Gibson could muscle a pitch to the outfield for a game-tying single.\nGibson would later recount that prior to the Series, Dodger scout Mel Didier had provided a report on Eckersley which claimed that with a 3–2 count against a left-handed hitter, one could be absolutely certain that Eckersley would throw a backdoor slider. Gibson said that when the count reached 3–2, he stepped out of the batter's box and, in his mind, could hear Didier's voice, with its distinctive Southern drawl, reiterating that same piece of advice. With that thought in mind, Gibson stepped back into the batter's box; and thus when Eckersley did in fact throw a backdoor slider, it was exactly the pitch Gibson was expecting.\nSwinging almost entirely with his upper body, Gibson then hit the pitch over the right-field fence. He limped around the bases and pumped his fist as his teammates stormed the field. The Dodgers won the game, 5–4.\nGibson did not have another plate appearance in the World Series. The Dodgers went on to defeat the A's in the World Series, 4–1.\nThe calls.\nDon Drysdale.\nDrysdale also called Kirk Gibson's walk-off home run for the Dodgers Radio Network:\nVin Scully.\nScully, calling the play-by-play for the NBC-TV (as previously mentioned) broadcast with color commentator Joe Garagiola, made repeated references to Gibson's legs, noting at one point that the batter was \nGibson worked the count to 3–2 as Mike Davis stole second base; the camera turned at that point to Steve Sax getting ready for his turn at the plate, and Scully reminded the viewers that \nScully said nothing for over a minute, allowing the pictures to tell the story. Finally, he said, \nReturning to the subject of Gibson's banged-up legs during a replay, Scully joked, \nAs NBC showed a replay of Gibson rounding second base in his home run trot, Scully then made a point to note Eckersley's pitching performance throughout the 1988 season, to put things in perspective.\nJack Buck.\nCBS handled the national radio broadcast of the 1988 World Series, with Jack Buck providing play-by-play and Bill White as the analyst. This was Buck's call, beginning with Buck speculating on what might happen if Gibson managed to reach base:\nThe last sentence is often remembered and quoted by fans. Buck followed it with, \nWhite responded,\nBuck repeated his exclamation and concluded his comments on Gibson's amazing feat with this thought:\nAftermath.\nThe NBC broadcast, when following Gibson's home run, also captured the brake lights of some Dodger fans who were leaving Dodger Stadium believing the game was lost. Among those were future Boston Red Sox chairman Tom Werner and his son, future Milwaukee Brewers senior Vice President Teddy Werner.\nMuch was made about Eckersley's decision to throw an offspeed pitch to Gibson, with Joe Garagiola repeatedly noting that Gibson clearly couldn't catch up to a fastball. To his credit, Eckersley fielded every reporters' question after the game, mostly blaming himself. Years later, he recalled, \"Somebody said that the Dodgers knew I threw a backdoor slider on 3–2. I don’t know if that’s true or not. I didn’t get to 3–2 that often, but if that’s what the guy told him [Gibson], if that’s what he had on his mind, good for him. Either way, it was a terrible slider.\"\nThe home run was included as a finalist in a Major League Baseball contest to determine the sport's \"Greatest Moment of All-Time.\" For years after the fact, it was regularly used in \"This Week in Baseball's\" closing montage sequence. An edited audio of Scully's 1988 call has been used in post-season action, in a TV ad featuring a recreational softball game, with a portly player essentially re-enacting that entire moment as he hits the softball over the right field fence to win the game. It was in competition on ESPN's \"SportsCenter\" for the Greatest Sports Highlight of All-Time.\nBy the time Gibson returned to his locker for postgame interviews, Dodger bullpen coach Mark Cresse had taped the name of Roy Hobbs over Gibson's nameplate, in reference to Gibson's heroics mirroring those of the film slugger that Robert Redford had played in \"The Natural\". Like Hobbs in the film's climactic scene, Gibson had represented the winning run when he came to the plate, was battling injury, had been down to his (and the team's) final strike and had homered to right field to win the game. NBC's pregame video for Game 2 narrated by Bob Costas included both the home run and its film counterpart.\nThe fate of the ball itself is unknown. According to Gibson, a woman sent him a picture of the bruise on her leg where the ball hit her, although no one has yet come forward with the ball. In fiction, a court struggle over the ownership of the ball was the primary plot of the June 29, 2011, episode of TNT legal drama \"Franklin &amp; Bash\".\nNear the end of the Major League Baseball season in the fall of 2011, Chevrolet began airing commercials for their Diamond &amp; Dream's Program, a giveaway designed to help the youth in their communities around the country. Prizes included a makeover for their baseball field. The commercials showed selected little league baseball players acting out some of baseball's greatest moments in history. One of them was Kirk Gibson's famous home run from the 1988 World Championship run of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The young boy acting out this moment could be seen running the bases, doing the same fist pump motion that Gibson was seen doing during his famous run around the bases.\nBefore the start of the 2018 season, the Dodgers commemorated the anniversary of Gibson's homerun with the introduction of the “Kirk Gibson seat,” which is where his home run landed after winning Game 1 of the 1988 World Series. The seat in question was Section 302, Row D, Seat 1, though the Dodgers have renumbered that seat 88. The seat will be painted blue and signed by Gibson and the tickets cost $300, which includes a $200 donation to the Kirk Gibson Foundation to raise money and awareness for Parkinson's Research.\nIn Game 4 of the 2018 World Series between the Dodgers and the Red Sox, 30 years after that 1988 World Series walk-off home run, Eckersley (who was there covering the Red Sox as a NESN color commentator and analyst) and Gibson reunited for the ceremonial first pitch at Dodger Stadium and Gibson had a bat ready before catching Eckersley's pitch."

        "text": "The 2009 Italian Grand Prix (formally the Formula 1 Gran Premio Santander d'Italia 2009) was a Formula One motor race held on 13 September 2009 at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza, Monza, Italy. It was the 13th race of the 2009 Formula One World Championship. It was contested over 53 laps.\nIt was the last win for Brawn GP and for team driver Rubens Barrichello. Teammate and Championship Leader Jenson Button came in second, completing Brawn's fourth (and last) one-two finish of the season, while the Ferrari of Kimi Räikkönen came third after reigning World Champion Lewis Hamilton crashed on the final lap. Hamilton's crash meant the race officially finished behind the safety car, despite the safety car not picking up the leader. Adrian Sutil, who finished in fourth place, recorded the first fastest lap of his career, and the first for the Force India team.\n, this is the last race win for a Brazilian Formula One driver.\nReport.\nBackground.\nJenson Button led the Drivers Championship by 16 points from Brawn GP teammate Rubens Barrichello, who led Red Bull's third placed man Sebastian Vettel by 3 points. Brawn led the Constructors Championship by 23½ points from Red Bull who were a further 48½ points ahead of winners of the previous race, Ferrari.\nVettel won his maiden Formula One race in the 2008 race for the Toro Rosso team, that made him the youngest driver to win a Formula One race, in the first race won by both the Toro Rosso team since they were formed as Minardi and by a customer Ferrari engine. The only other Italian Grand Prix winners in the field are Fernando Alonso and Barrichello. No Italian has won his home Grand Prix since Ferrari's Ludovico Scarfiotti won his only race at the 1966 race. Jarno Trulli, Vitantonio Liuzzi and Giancarlo Fisichella were the only current Italians in the field this year, with Luca Badoer replaced as Ferrari's stand-in by Fisichella. Fisichella became the first Italian since Ivan Capelli in 1992 to race for Ferrari at Monza, after terminating his Force India contract. Fisichella was replaced by Force India test driver Liuzzi.\nRenault decided to use KERS for the first time since Spanish Grand Prix weekend.\nPractice.\nThe first session of the Italian GP finished with the McLarens on top with Lewis Hamilton and Heikki Kovalainen first and second fastest, respectively. Force India's Adrian Sutil finished the session in third. Renault's Fernando Alonso finished fourth while teammate Romain Grosjean finished fifteenth. Fischella, driving for Ferrari for the first time in his career, finished eighth ahead of teammate Kimi Räikkönen who ended the session in tenth. Toyota's Trulli and Timo Glock were at the back of the pack. Championship leader Jenson Button ended seventh while his Brawn teammate Rubens Barrichello finished twelfth.\nIn the second session Force India's Adrian Sutil was fastest, ahead of the two Renaults of Grosjean and Alonso. Hamilton was eleventh with Kovalainen coming in fourth. Button in a Brawn finished 19th, with only Fisichella separating him from last place. Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel came eighteenth, and Mark Webber in fourteenth.\nThe final practice session ahead of Qualifying again saw Sutil fastest, ahead of the Brawn of Jenson Button with teammate Barrichello in fourth. The two McLarens ended fifth and sixth, with Fisichella's replacement at Force India, Vitantonio Liuzzi, in seventh. The two Red Bulls ended the session 17th and 18th. Fisichella ended the session last, with Räikkönen's other Ferrari in twelfth.\nQualifying.\nThe first session, lasting 20 minutes, decided the final five places on the grid. Five minutes into the session Liuzzi ran off the track but did not damage his car and managed to proceed through to the next part of qualifying. Räikkönen topped the session ahead of Hamilton and Kovalainen. Both Toro Rossos and both Williams cars were knocked out along with the Toyota of Timo Glock. Fisichella made it through to the next session, making it the first time since the Hungarian Grand Prix that both Ferraris had made it through to Q2. Grosjean also progressed to Q2.\nThe second session, lasting 15 minutes, decided positions 11 to 15. Five minutes into the session Nick Heidfeld's BMW engine gave way to leave him in 15th for the race. Seven minutes later, the other BMW of Robert Kubica appeared to have the same problem and pulled off with engine problems just before the first corner. This left Kubica qualifying in 13th. Fisichella was unable to make it through to the final session of qualifying. Button topped the session, with Hamilton in second and Force India's Adrian Sutil in third. After the chequered flag had fallen Liuzzi was the final driver to post a time moving from 13th into the top 10. The other drivers not to make it were Grosjean and Trulli.\nThe final session, lasting ten minutes, decided the top ten positions. Early on, Alonso set the fastest time in the first sector, but it was Räikkönen who had the best time overall. Very soon afterwards Hamilton set the fastest lap, while Webber, Alonso, Sutil and Räikkönen traded second place. The chequered flag fell and very few cars were still out, but it was Hamilton who came out on top to snatch pole from Sutil. Although Button qualified sixth and his teammate Barrichello in fifth, they looked well-placed after the fuel loads were released and both were on a one stop strategy, while Hamilton, Sutil and Räikkönen were all on a two stop strategy.\nRace.\nAt the start, Lewis Hamilton held onto his lead with Kimi Räikkönen in second, ahead of Adrian Sutil. Heikki Kovalainen, on a one-stop fuel strategy was overtaken by the similarly fuelled Brawns of Rubens Barrichello, off the start line, and Jenson Button, through the second Lesmo. Championship contender Mark Webber was spun by Robert Kubica at Della Roggia on the opening lap and was forced to retire. By Lap 15, Kubica had also retired with an oil leak. Before this, on lap 9, Kubica was shown the black flag with orange circle because he damaged his front wing during his contact with Webber, meaning he was summoned to the pits to repair it.\nThe battle for the lead was tactical, with the Brawn cars stopping only once while Hamilton was on a two-stop strategy. Barrichello and Button were able to lap consistently faster than Hamilton despite their heavier fuel load, meaning when Hamilton emerged from his second pit stop he found himself behind both Brawns in third position. Reigning World Champion Hamilton tried in vain to overtake Championship leader Button over the final few laps before crashing into the barriers at the second Lesmo as he attempted to catch Button. Hamilton's crash left debris across the race track, meaning the safety car was deployed despite it being the final lap of the race. The safety car was therefore unable to pick up the leader, Barrichello, before he took the chequered flag as he would take Brawn's eighth win of the season and his third win at Monza. \nThis race had also proven to be the 11th and last victory, as well as the last podium for Rubens Barrichello's very long, very distinguished and very up-and-down career.\nThe safety car ended a race long battle between the similarly fuelled Räikkönen and Sutil. Sutil was able to keep up with the Ferrari driver throughout the race. Both made their second and final pit stop at the same time, Räikkönen coming out of the pits first despite a delay leaving his garage after Sutil drove too fast into his box, knocking over a mechanic, who was unhurt. Despite Sutil's pressure over the closing stages, Räikkönen held to inherit third place. Sutil did have the consolation of claiming the fastest lap of the race, Force India's first in Formula One.\nFernando Alonso finished fifth, ahead of Kovalainen despite the Finn being on the race-winning one-stop strategy. Nick Heidfeld finished seventh after working his way through the field from fifteenth on the grid. Sebastian Vettel took the final point, ahead of Ferrari debutant Giancarlo Fisichella. Fisichella's replacement at Force India, Vitantonio Liuzzi, retired with a mechanical problem while challenging for the points.\nPost–race.\nThe poor performance from the Red Bull cars, combined with Brawn's 1–2 finish, meant the Drivers Championship became effectively a two-horse race between Button, who led Barrichello by 14 points with four races to go. Vettel was 26 points behind Button with Webber a further 2.5 points adrift. Brawn team boss Ross Brawn said after the race he would allow his drivers to compete amongst themselves for the Drivers Championship, as his team was virtually assured of the Constructors Championship. Barrichello admitted he was relishing the prospect of a straight title fight after playing second fiddle to Michael Schumacher whilst the German won five world championships at Ferrari. A visibly more relaxed Button was magnanimous in defeat and happy to face a battle from within.\nWebber admitted frustration at his first non-finish of the year following such a \"small\" accident, while Vettel insisted his Championship chances were not over. McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh did not criticise Hamilton for his last lap crash, stating the accident was a result of the Briton's \"never-give-up attitude, his unquenchable desire to fight until the very last metre of the very last lap.\" The focus of the F1 paddock after the race, however, was on the looming Crashgate hearing at the FIA World Motor Sport Council in Paris the following week. This was to determine whether Renault had asked former driver Nelson Piquet Jr. to crash at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, to aid teammate Fernando Alonso ultimately win the race.\nLewis Hamilton mathematically conceded the defence of his World Championship following the result of this race as only Jenson Button, Rubens Barrichello, Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber were mathematically able to win the Championship. World Champion Kimi Räikkönen also mathematically conceded the World Championship as a result of this race, while and World Champion Fernando Alonso was already out of contention before this race. As a result, it meant following this race a brand new World Champion was guaranteed to be crowned for 2009.\nClassification.\nQualifying.\n\"Cars that use the KERS system are marked with \"‡\"\"\nRace.\n\"Cars that use the KERS system are marked with \"‡\"\""

Casey was a part of what some consider to be the best recruiting class in UK history (a class which included 11 players, notably Dan Issel, Mike Pratt, Casey, and Terry Mills). Casey suffered a severely broken leg between his junior and senior year. Because of this, he had to redshirt what would have been his senior year, which may have cost UK a national championship in 1970.

The 18.7 points per game he averaged for his career ranks ninth in UK history, one-tenth of a point below Jamal Mashburn. He also led the Wildcats in free throw shooting in 1968 at 82.3%, and in assists in 1969, with 4.6 per game.\nCasey had the honor of being the only man to out-score Dan Issel at the collegiate level; in their sophomore year Casey averaged 20.1 points per game to Issel's 16.4.

He appeared in 38 games for the Philadelphia Phillies from 1969 to 1970. He went on to serve as a major league scout or executive for over 40 years, most recently for the Detroit Tigers from 2002 to 2020.\nEarly life.\nReid was born in Chicago on January 7, 1947. He attended El Rancho High School in Pico Rivera, California. He initially studied at Cerritos College in Norwalk, California, before transferring to Arizona State University. Including the \"secondary phase\" and January drafts at the time, Reid was selected four times during the first three years of the MLB amateur draft, 1965 through 1967, including twice by the New York Mets. Finally, the Phillies drafted him in the second round of the secondary phase of the 1967 Major League Baseball draft on June 6. He ultimately signed a contract and entered professional baseball just under a month later.\nPlaying career.\nReid played two seasons in the minor leagues from 1967 to 1969. He made his MLB debut on September 10, 1969, at the age of 22, entering as a pinch hitter, drawing a walk in his only plate appearance, and scoring a run in a 6–2 win over the Chicago Cubs. In three separate stints on the Phillies' major league roster, Reid served as a pinch hitter and started 15 games in the outfield, 14 of them as a center fielder. He collected ten hits, including one double, and scored ten runs. He posted a batting average of .147 with one run batted in. He played his final major league game on September 29, 1970, at the age of 23. For the rest of his playing career, Reid played mostly for Triple-A teams, including the Eugene Emeralds in 1971 and 1973, and the Tidewater Tides and the Syracuse Chiefs in 1972.\nScouting career.\nReid began his scouting career with the Phillies in 1973. He also served as scouting director for the Chicago Cubs in 1986 and 1987. He was one of the early hires in the Florida Marlins front office as a Major League scout in 1992, which is where he met Al Avila and former Tigers general manager Dave Dombrowski. Reid became an assistant to Dombrowski with the Marlins in 1999 and was promoted to vice president a few months later. When Dombrowski joined the Detroit Tigers before the 2002 season, he brought Reid with him as part of his inner circle of advisers, with Avila eventually joining them. He worked for the Tigers as a scouting director, adviser and vice president of player personnel for 18 years.\nPersonal life.\nReid was married to his wife Sherry until his death. Together, they had two children: Brian and Lindsay. Brian followed in his father's footsteps and became a scout for the Tigers and Mets.\nReid died June 29, 2021, at the age of 74."

He transferred to Phoenix Christian High School for his final two years where he again was a three sport letterman.\nCollege.\nIn 1957, Lindsey began his college career at Pasadena Nazarene College where he played basketball and baseball and earned Freshman Athlete of the Year honors. In 1959, Lindsey transferred to Grand Canyon College (GCC) where he played three seasons of basketball and two seasons of baseball. Considered one of the top small college basketball players (Who's Who of Small College Basketball) at the time, he set five basketball scoring records, one of which remains to this day; that is, most field goals in a single game – 18.\nCoaching career.\nCollege.\nGrand Canyon College (GCC).\nLindsey was hired by GCC Athletic Director, Dave Brazell, as the Head Basketball Coach in the Spring of 1965. At the time, GCC was a small Southern Baptist college with an enrollment of approximately 500. The basketball program's total budget at the time was $2,000 with no recruiting budget. Coach Lindsey had no assistant coach and, in addition to head coach, was the trainer, statistician, recruiter, academic advisor, hired officials, arranged score and clock keepers, swept the gym floor, and performed every other necessary role. In fact, his wife Jerri washed the team uniforms. It was not uncommon to visit the Lindsey household and see stacks of GCC basketball uniforms and warm-ups. As part of his GCC job, he had to teach 12 hours of classes (e.g., archery, golf, and kinesiology) per semester and also coached the tennis team.\nLindsey's post-season record was 30–9. He won the NAIA District VII Championship in 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1979, and 1980. He won two NAIA National Championships in 1975 and 1978. His team also earned the 1975 tournament Sportsmanship Award...the only team to ever win the championship and sportsmanship award in the same year. GCC was the smallest college to ever win the NAIA Championship.\nLindsey was the first head basketball coach at an Arizona college or university to win a national championship. He is the only head coach in Arizona history to win two national championships.\nIn addition, he was the youngest college/university coach to reach 300 wins, which he accomplished at age 40.\nLindsey produced five All-Americans and had three NBA draft picks.\nFort Hays State University (FHSU).\nLindsey was hired by Fort Hays State in Kansas in 1982 to a four-year contract, with the understanding that he would be released from it if he was offered and accepted the University of Arizona head coaching job.\nUniversity of Arizona (UA).\nLindsey was hired by the University of Arizona of the Pac-10 Conference in April 1982, just a few days prior to national letter of intent day. He inherited a team from the prior season, and had just lost its best player (Jeff Collins) via transfer to UNLV. Lindsey remains the only native Arizonan ever to be hired as a head coach in basketball or football at the three state universities.\nLindsey was dismissed immediately after his first season; the Wildcats won just once in the Pac-10 and were overall, the worst record in school He filed a $3 million wrongful termination suit against the school, claiming that he had received a verbal contract promising a minimum of four years to improve the school's basketball program. Lindsey prevailed in his legal battle and was awarded $695,000 in damages. This award was later trimmed and the former coach collected $215,000.\nHe was succeeded by Lute Olson, formerly the head coach at Iowa in the Big Ten Conference for nine seasons. Three years earlier, the 1980 Hawkeyes reached the Final Four of the NCAA tournament.\nInternational experience.\n1975 - Assistant Coach for NAIA All Star team exhibition series with Mexican Olympic team in Mexico City.\n1978 - GCC was chosen to represent the NAIA to play four exhibition games in Argentina.\n1981 - Assistant coach for Philippines men%27s national basketball team."

        "text": "Frank Matthew Mills (18 March 1873 – 18 February 1925) was a Welsh rugby union forward who played club rugby for Cardiff and Swansea and won 13 caps for Wales. He is best remembered as being one of the Wales squad that won the Triple Crown for the first time in 1893.\nRugby career.\nAlthough Mills originally played for Mountain Ash, he came to note as a rugby player when he represented first-class club Swansea, which he joined in 1892. His first season at Swansea also saw him selected for Wales, coming into the pack with fellow new caps, Wallace Watts and Arthur Boucher. Although Watts and Boucher were Newport players, Mills' international career would mirror theirs; playing 11 games with Boucher and 12 with Watts.\nHis debut Wales campaign was a poor one for the country. Mills played in all three games of the 1892 Home Nations Championship, and Wales lost all of them. Despite this, the selectors kept faith with the team and in particular the forwards, which paid dividends the next season when Wales, under the captaincy of Arthur 'Monkey' Gould won the Triple Crown for the first time in their history. Mills played in all three games, in a pack which was recognised for its weight, strength and scrummaging tactics.\nMills was reselected for the 1894 Home Nations Championship, but a mixture of poor pitch conditions and Welsh in-fighting resulted in two loses and just a single win. At the end of the 1894 season, Mills is recorded playing at least one match for Glamorgan, alongside Swansea team-mate Billy Bancroft. The next season Mills had switched clubs from the Whites of Swansea to the Blues of Cardiff, but retained his position in the Welsh squad. By playing in all three games of the 1895 Championship Mills had represented Wales in 12 consecutive international games, and his final game for Wales was the opening match of the 1896 tournament, which saw England run seven tries passed the Welsh without reply. The Welsh selectors lost faith in the pack, bringing in five new caps for the next game. Mills was one of those players replaced and never represented Wales again.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

They defeated the host side France in their opening game, then beat the other teams in Pool D, finishing top of the pool. In the knockout stage, they defeated Scotland in the quarter-finals, before losing in the semi-finals to eventual champions South Africa. In the Bronze Final they once again faced France, whom they defeated for a second time to attain third place.\nTheir second best result was fourth place in 2015. They also progressed past the pool stage in 1999 and 2011. In 1999 they defeated Ireland in the quarter-final play-offs, but lost in the quarter-finals to France. In 2011 they lost to host team New Zealand in the quarter-finals.\nArgentina has yet to host the World Cup. The Argentina national team is the most successful of any national side from the Americas at the tournament.\nBy matches.\n1991.\nPool 3 games -\n1995.\nPool B games -\n1999.\nPool D games\nQuarter final place offs -\nQuarter finals -\n2003.\nGroup A games -\n2007.\n\"Los Pumas\" began their final preparation for the 2007 World Cup with a two-test series against visiting Ireland, who was grouped against them in France. In the first test on 26 May at Santa Fe, they scored a 22–20 win on a last-minute drop goal by Felipe Contepomi. Both teams were heavily experimental, especially the Irish, with stars such as Brian O'Driscoll, Ronan O'Gara, Paul O'Connell and Gordon D'Arcy missing from the touring squad. The Pumas were themselves missing many stars who were playing that weekend in the final round of the 2006–07 Top 14 season in France. The second test against Ireland was a 16-0 Pumas win at Vélez Sársfield on 2 June. On 9 June, \"Los Pumas\" completed a clean sweep of their mid-year tests with a 24–6 win over in Mendoza. They split their final warmup tests, defeating neighbours 70–14 at CASI in Buenos Aires on 4 August and losing to Wales at Millennium Stadium 27–20 on 18 August.\nAt the World Cup, \"Los Pumas\" were drawn into the so-called pool of death, featuring two other teams ranked in the top six in the IRB rankings—Ireland and the hosts France. On top of this, they opened the World Cup at Stade de France against the French, marking the third consecutive World Cup in which they played against the host nation in the World Cup opener. In possibly one of their finest hours, the Pumas took a 17–9 lead into the half, and held on for a surprising 17–12 win. The Pumas subsequently beat Georgia 33–3 on 11 September at the Stade de Gerland, Lyon. Argentina then went on to beat Namibia 63–3 in Marseille, the biggest winning margin in Argentine World Cup history. They then went on to secure a 30–15 victory against Ireland which ensured that they topped the group. They then defeated Scotland 19–13 in the quarter-final at the Stade de France. The Pumas' improbable run towards the Webb Ellis trophy ended in a comprehensive 37–13 defeat by the Springboks in the semi-final at Stade de France. However, the Pumas recovered to beat France for the second time in the 2007 Rugby World Cup, a 34–10 win in the 3rd/4th place playoff. The 3rd place showing for the Pumas in the 2007 World Cup was Argentina's best ever result in Rugby World Cup history, equal or better to the best showing by IRB founding nations Wales (who were 3rd in the 1987 Rugby World Cup), Scotland (who were 4th in the 1991 Rugby World Cup) and Ireland (which has never qualified for the Rugby World Cup semi-finals).\nDuring their World Cup run, the normally football-crazed Argentines embraced the \"Pumas\" so much that \"El Superclásico\", the Buenos Aires football derby between Boca Juniors and River Plate that is normally the biggest event in Argentine sport, was rescheduled so that it would not conflict with the Pumas' quarter-final match. As the only major Spanish language country in the 2007 Rugby World Cup, the Pumas also had considerable support from rugby fans in Spain, Uruguay, and other Latin American countries during their impressive five-game winning streak.\nQuarter-finals -\nSemi-finals -\nBronze final game - \n2011.\nQuarter-finals\n2015.\nQuarter-finals\nSemi-finals\nBronze final game - \nHosting.\nSo far Argentina has not hosted any World Cup games, as no RWC has been held in the Americas yet."

He was drafted by the Cowboys in the third round of the 2009 NFL Draft. He played college football at Ball State University.\nEarly years.\nBrewster attended Wyoming High School and lettered three times in football. As a senior, he received All-state, All-city, Cincinnati Hills League Offensive Player of the Year and \"Tremendous 26\" Division Ill Player of the Year honors. He also practiced basketball.\nHe accepted a football scholarship from Ball State University. As a true freshman, he started the first 4 games at right tackle, before being moved to right guard for the rest of the season. As a sophomore, he was named the regular starter at right tackle, allowing just 2 sacks and one quarterback pressure on 373 pass plays.\nAs a junior, he blocked for an offense that set school records in total offense (5,640 yards) and passing yards (3,704 yards). In 2008, he helped Ball State achieve 12 straight wins and a national ranking for the first time in school history. He was penalized just once and allowed only 2.5 sacks and one quarterback pressure on 405 pass plays. He was a four-year starter and received first-team All-Mid-American Conference accolades in 2007 and 2008.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nBrewster was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the third round (75th overall) of the 2009 NFL Draft. As a rookie, he was placed on the injured reserve list after he tore a pectoral muscle during post-minicamp workouts.\nOn October 15, 2010, during a 1-7 start, the Cowboys decided to release him due to a lack of production and to make room for wide receiver Jesse Holley. After his release he was signed to the team's practice squad, before being released on July 27, 2011.\nHis problems were never helped by the fact that he followed a string of unsuccessful offensive lineman selections, made by the team in the first rounds of the draft: Al Johnson (2003), Jacob Rogers (2004), Stephen Peterman (2004) and James Marten (2007).\nKansas City Command.\nOn December 30, , Brewster signed with the Kansas City Command of the Arena Football League, reuniting with his Ball State teammates quarterback Nate Davis and receiver Darius Hill. In 2012, he suffered a season-ending knee injury in the sixth game against the San Jose SaberCats. He wasn't re-signed after the season.\nPersonal life.\nOn September 3, 2011, despite being out of football, the NFL suspended him 4 games after violating the league's policy on banned substances. Brewster still resides in Dallas, Texas with his family."

        "text": "Golf telecasts have aired on NBC since 1954, with some of its earliest telecasts having included the 1954 U.S. Open, and the first televised coverage of the Ryder Cup in 1959.\nPresently, NBC televises around 8 PGA Tour events per-season, alternating with CBS on the FedEx Cup Playoffs since 2022. It also serves as the broadcast television outlet for two of the men's majors, the U.S. Open and The Open Championship. NBC has occasionally aired coverage for selected European Tour and LPGA events, although the majority of these tours' events are broadcast by sister network Golf Channel.\nAfter NBC's parent company NBC Universal was acquired by Comcast–owner of Golf Channel –in February 2011, the channel's operations were merged directly into NBC Sports, and golf broadcasts on NBC took on the Golf Channel on NBC branding. \nSince 2022, due to the realignments of NBC Sports output stemming from the launch of Peacock, closure of NBCSN, the move of cable rights to majors to USA Network, and NBC's renewed PGA Tour contract, the \"Golf Channel on NBC\" title was dropped, and all golf telecasts across NBCUniversal properties (including Golf Channel) are now billed as NBC Sports telecasts on-air.\nCoverage overview.\nEarly years.\nNBC first began televising golf events after it was awarded the television rights to the U.S. Open in 1954 with Lindsey Nelson anchoring the coverage from the 18th hole tower. In 1959, NBC provided the first ever telecast (airing two hours of highlights) of the Ryder Cup. The 1962 U.S. Open, marked the first time that NBC covered golf on a Sunday. The U.S. Open continued to air on the network through the 1965 event, however NBC rebuffed a long-term deal to broadcast the event when the United States Golf Association (USGA) decided on a true contract in 1966.\nThe network, however, did televise a handful of PGA Tour events over the following decades. For example, NBC's broadcast of the 1962 Tournament of Champions as the first color golf telecast. Five years later, NBC broadcast the Hawaiian Open Golf Tournament, which was the first live color sports transmission from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland.\nIn 1983, NBC televised the first Skins Game ever held, with Vin Scully and Ben Crenshaw serving as announcers for the tournament broadcast. From 1983 to 1989, Scully juggled duties for both golf and Major League Baseball telecasts for NBC, usually teaming with Lee Trevino. The only notable affiliate not to televise the first event was KYW-TV (now a CBS owned-and-operated station) in Philadelphia. \n1990s: Ryder Cup and U.S. Open.\nIn 1991, coverage of the Skins Game moved to ABC Sports, after NBC obtained the rights to broadcast Notre Dame college football games.\nAfter Vin Scully left NBC Sports following the network's loss of the Major League Baseball package to CBS, Bryant Gumbel, who was still co-hosting \"Today\" at the time, took over as NBC's primary golf anchor. In 1991, Gumbel was replaced by Charlie Jones and subsequently, Dick Enberg and (after the former left NBC Sports for CBS in the year 2000) Dan Hicks.\nThe American Century Celebrity Golf Classic was held in 1990 and sponsored by NBC, which broadcasts the second- and third-round coverage. The game \"NBC Sports Real Golf\" was unveiled at the 17th annual American Century Championship Celebrity Golf Event and promoted during NBC's broadcast of the event. NBC generally televised around five regular PGA Tour events per season at this time. \nIn 1991, the network acquired the broadcast rights to the Ryder Cup.\nIn 1995, NBC Sports acquired rights to the USGA championships, including the U.S. Open, from ESPN/ABC. ESPN retained rights to a portion of the weekday coverage, however NBC was the dominant rightsholder, including exclusive coverage of the weekend rounds. This took NBC's coverage to a new level, and marked the first time in the modern era of television that the network had televised a major championship. NBC, and its lead analyst Johnny Miller (who joined NBC in 1990), became synonymous with the U.S. Open, televising it for the next 20 years, through 2014.\n2000s: Expansion of PGA Tour rights.\nIn January 2006, the PGA Tour announced a new set of television deals covering 2007 to 2012, increase the number of events covered by NBC Sports from five to ten. The deal also renewed broadcast deals for the Ryder Cup and the USGA Championships, including the U.S. Open. NBC is the only network which provide four days of major tournament coverage (CBS, which airs the Masters and the PGA Championship, only provides weekend coverage of its tournaments; starting in 2010, the Open Championship would not be aired live on a major broadcast network at all, with all four rounds airing on ESPN and ABC providing only edited highlights of the event).\nNBC carried the weekend coverage of the JELD-WEN Tradition in 2007, 2009 and 2010. Golf Channel covered the early rounds (and all four rounds in 2008 while NBC carried the Summer Olympic Games from Beijing). NBC carried a tape delayed broadcast of the World Series of Golf, which was held from May 13 to 16, 2007, on June 23 and 24 of that year; the 2008 event of the series, played from May 12 to 15, and was televised by CBS on June 28 and 29.\nIn 2007, The Shark Shootout was moved to December, and was broadcast live by both Golf Channel and NBC. The event was originally broadcast in the United States by sister cable channel USA Network, and CBS – with USA broadcasting the first round on a tape-delayed basis, and CBS handling the second round live. The final round was not broadcast live to the entire country, as CBS' commitment to the NFL only allowed the round as it took place to air in the Eastern and Central Time Zones, with the rest of the U.S. seeing the event beginning at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time.\n2010s: Golf Channel re-branding, loss of U.S. Open, gain of Open Championship.\nIn January 2011, Comcast, owners of Golf Channel, acquired a majority stake in the NBC network's parent company NBC Universal. Comcast's existing sports properties were merged into the NBC Sports division, allowing Golf Channel to pool its personalities and other personnel with NBC. As a result of this synergy, Golf Channel took over production of NBC's golf telecasts, which were now co-branded under the \"Golf Channel on NBC\" banner, beginning at the 2011 WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, with a co-branded logo adding the NBC peacock to Golf Channel's existing logo (the co-branded presentation would also migrate to Golf Channel proper shortly afterward).\nWhile most golf broadcasts on NBC used Golf Channel's on-air branding as graphics packages as a result of the changes, the Players Championship, Ryder Cup and USGA tournaments maintain the distinctive theme music that NBC used prior to the rebranding (such as the theme from \"The Man from Snowy River\" for the Players, and Yanni's \"In Celebration of Man\" for the U.S. Open, which, with a rearrangement, was also temporarily used for the Open Championship).\nIn both 2013 and 2014, NBC broadcast weekend coverage of the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open from Scotland. The 2013 event was played at Castle Stuart near Inverness, while the 2014 event was hosted by Royal Aberdeen, near Aberdeen. Coverage of the tournament during both years was anchored by Rich Lerner, and the action was called by lead European Tour announcer Dougie Donnelly and Golf Channel's lead PGA Tour analyst Frank Nobilo.\nIn August 2013, the USGA signed a broadcasting contract with Fox Sports, effective with the 2015 tournament season, ending NBC's relationship with the association after 20 years. Fox, which by the time of its first U.S. Open will have televised just two PGA Tour sanctioned events in its history (the unofficial CVS Caremark Charity Classic in 2011 and the unofficial Franklin Templeton Shootout in 2014), paid US$1 billion for the exclusive rights to all USGA championship events. Johnny Miller expressed disappointment at the loss, saying that he \"had a feeling\" NBC would not retain the rights, and that Fox would not be able to \"fall out of a tree and do the U.S. Open\". The 2014 U.S. Open at Pinehurst Resort was the network's 20th, and final, U.S. Open telecast in the modern era.\nOn June 8, 2015, it was announced that NBC and Golf Channel had acquired rights to The Open Championship under a 12-year deal, replacing ESPN. The R&amp;A was, reportedly, won over by NBC's rights fee (which is approximately doubled in comparison to ESPN), and the performance of NBC's broadcasts of the Premier League, which air in a similar weekend morning time slot in the U.S.. The deal restored a men's major back to NBC for the first time since 2014, gave Golf Channel coverage of its first-ever major, and returned the Open to broadcast network television. Originally stated to begin in 2017, it was reported on October 12, 2015, that ESPN had opted out the final year of its contract to NBC, thus causing NBC coverage to begin in 2016 instead, mirroring a similar move by the BBC (who opted out to new rightsholder Sky Sports).\nIn January 2016, former CBS analyst David Feherty joined NBC to become a full-time contributor for its coverage and Golf Channel. Feherty already hosted a self-titled interview series for Golf Channel. Long-time ESPN personality Mike Tirico made his on-air debut with NBC during the 2016 Open Championship.\nNBC and Golf Channel broadcast the revived golf tournaments at the 2016 Summer Olympics, as part of NBC's coverage of the Games. NBC staff served as the host broadcaster for the golf events on behalf of Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS).\n2020s: PGA Tour renewal, regaining the U.S. Open.\nIn 2020, NBC renewed its rights to the PGA Tour through 2030 under an eight-year deal beginning in 2022. While NBC will still air an average of 8 tournaments per-year, coverage of the final three FedEx Cup playoff events will now alternate between CBS and NBC.\nOn June 29, 2020, it was announced that Fox had withdrawn from its contract to carry USGA tournaments, and had sold the remaining seven years of the contract to NBC Sports through 2027. It was reported that the rescheduling of the majors caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was a factor in the decision (Fox had reportedly proposed moving the 2020 U.S. Open exclusively to FS1 to overcome conflicts with weekend college football and the NFL), and that Fox had originally discussed working with NBC before negotiating the withdrawal instead. The first event televised under the new contract was the 2020 U.S. Women's Amateur.\nIn November 2021, it was announced that early round coverage of the U.S. Open, U.S. Women's Open, The Open Championship, and the Women's Open, will be moved from Golf Channel to USA Network beginning in 2022.\nCommentators.\nThe following is a list of television personalities for NBC Sports Group's telecasts of golf, which are carried by NBC and Golf Channel."

        "text": "The Boston Open is an annual badminton tournament held in Cambridge, Massachusetts just across the Charles River from Boston. It has become the leading regularly held tournament in the Eastern United States.\nHistory.\nThe Boston Open was established in 1997 as regional tournament for Northeastern players, the first significant open badminton tournament in Massachusetts since the earlier New England Open which had been played from the mid 1930s to the late 1980s. When the tournament was created, the Rockwell Cage at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts was chosen as the location for the tournament. The Rockwell Cage is an athletic facility at MIT, and home of the university's basketball and volleyball teams. The Boston Open has been held there ever since. Over time the tournament began to develop and gain popularity. It would soon become one of the top tournaments in North America, attracting badminton players from around the world.\nSponsorship.\nIn order to operate the Boston Open relies upon aid from sponsors. The MIT Badminton Club has been the primary sponsor for the Boston Open since 1997. The club works hard every year to make sure the tournament runs smoothly. The MIT Badminton Club is partially responsible for getting the Boston Open to where it is today. In 2014 adidas became the official named sponsor of the tournament, helping the Boston Open gain even more recognition and further prove its significance. With the new sponsorship from adidas in 2014, the Boston Open was able to increase their total tournament prize money to $22,150.\nNotable players.\nHoward Bach is a professional Vietnamese-American badminton player. He annually partakes in the Boston Open and has managed to win the championship for the men's doubles twice. Howard Bach is also one of the few American badminton players to participate in the Olympics."

        "text": "Andrew Scott Bailey (born May 31, 1984) is an American former professional baseball pitcher and current pitching coach for the Boston Red Sox. As a player, he played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Oakland Athletics, Los Angeles Angels, Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, and Philadelphia Phillies. He played college baseball for Wagner College and was selected by the Oakland Athletics in the sixth round of the 2006 MLB draft. He made his MLB debut in 2009 and won that season's American League Rookie of the Year Award. He was an All-Star in 2009 and 2010 while he was the closer for the Athletics. He has also been a pitching coach for the San Francisco Giants.\nBaseball career.\nHigh school and college.\nBailey was born in Voorhees, New Jersey, and first played baseball at Paul VI High School in Haddon Township, New Jersey. He attended Wagner College in Staten Island. Bailey was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 16th round (475th overall) of the 2005 Major League Baseball draft, but decided to return to Wagner for his senior year and earn a degree in business administration. His Wagner number 17 jersey was retired in January 2010, which made him only the fourth former student-athlete to be honored in that way.\nOakland Athletics.\nThe Oakland Athletics selected Bailey in the sixth round, with the 188th overall selection, of the 2006 Major League Baseball draft. He signed with Oakland for a signing bonus of $135,000.\nBailey made the Athletics Opening Day 25-man roster for the season, and made his major league debut on April 6, 2009, pitching a scoreless inning against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Bailey was selected to represent the Athletics in the 2009 MLB All-Star Game in St. Louis. He was the 2009 August AL Rookie of the Month. He broke the Athletics rookie save record on September 12 against the Minnesota Twins with his 24th save of the season.\nAfter a final line of 26 saves (9th in the AL) and a 1.84 ERA and a 0.876 WHIP, Bailey was named 2009 American League Rookie of the Year on November 16, 2009. \nHe was selected again to the All-Star team in 2010, which he finished with 25 saves (10th in the AL), a 1.47 ERA and a 0.959 WHIP.\nOn September 12, 2011, Bailey was hit right above the temple by a line drive in batting practice. He felt fine, passed concussion tests, and sat out the next few days. He returned to action to face the Tigers a few games later. His ERA ballooned to 3.24, though he did finish with 24 saves.\nBoston Red Sox.\nOn December 28, 2011, Bailey and Ryan Sweeney were traded from Oakland to the Boston Red Sox for Josh Reddick and two minor leaguers. On April 4, 2012, it was announced that Bailey would require reconstructive surgery on his right thumb and that he would begin the 2012 season on the disabled list. Bailey made his 2012 debut with the Red Sox on August 14, pitching a third of an inning in a loss to Baltimore. He finished the 2012 season with 15 innings pitched, a 7.04 ERA, and a 1.89 WHIP.\nBailey began the season as a middle reliever with the Red Sox, but when closer Joel Hanrahan was injured in mid-April, Bailey took over the closer job. He was named the American League player of the week for the week of April 21. Bailey compiled 8 saves, a 3–1 record and a 3.77 ERA in 30 appearances until he suffered a shoulder injury that kept him from playing for the rest of the season. After the All-Star Break, MRIs confirmed there was a torn capsule and damaged labrum in his throwing shoulder. He underwent shoulder surgery on July 24, ending his 2013 season. After the 2013 season, Bailey was non-tendered by the Red Sox, making him a free agent.\nNew York Yankees.\nOn February 22, 2014, Bailey signed a minor league deal with the New York Yankees with a $2.5 million salary if he made the major league roster, and a club option for the 2015 season. After numerous setbacks in his recovery from his shoulder injury, Bailey was ruled out for the 2014 season on August 17. The Yankees signed him to a new minor league contract on November 7, 2014, after declining his 2015 option a few days earlier.\nThe Yankees promoted Bailey to the major leagues on September 1, 2015. On September 2, he entered in the seventh inning at Boston, his first appearance in a game in two years. In 10 appearances, he posted a 5.19 ERA. On November 3, the Yankees declined Bailey's option for the 2016 season, making him a free agent.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nBailey signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies in December 2015, receiving an invitation to spring training. He was called up to the Phillies on April 20, 2016. He was designated for assignment on August 2, and released on August 6.\nLos Angeles Angels.\nOn August 13, 2016, Bailey signed a minor league deal with the Los Angeles Angels. Bailey was called up in late August and collected six saves for the Angels in 12 games, with a 2.38 ERA and a 0.971 WHIP. On November 9, Bailey signed a one-year, $1 million contract to remain with the Angels. His 2017 season was cut short due to a shoulder injury, limiting him to four games.\nPost-playing career.\nBailey announced his retirement on February 26, 2018, to take up the job of instant replay coordinator and coaching assistant for the Los Angeles Angels. Bailey spent the 2019 season as the Angels bullpen coach.\nPrior to the 2020 season, Bailey was hired by the San Francisco Giants as their pitching coach.\nIn November 2023, Bailey was hired as pitching coach by the Red Sox, replacing Dave Bush, who had been dismissed following the 2023 season.\nPhilanthropy.\nBailey serves as Director of Development for the Strike 3 Foundation, a non-profit charity dedicated to pediatric cancer research, founded by former Athletics and Red Sox teammate Craig Breslow."

        "text": "William Alvan Faul (April 21, 1940 – February 21, 2002) was an American Major League Baseball player, a right-handed pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, Chicago Cubs and San Francisco Giants (1962–66; 1970). He stood tall and weighed . \nBorn in Cincinnati, Faul attended Goshen High School. Playing alongside his brother Jerry, Faul helped Goshen win the 1958 Ohio state baseball championship, then he played baseball at the University of Cincinnati, where he set the school's strikeout record and once fanned 24 batters in a game.\nBaseball career.\nFaul signed with the Tigers in 1962. Assigned to the Knoxville Smokies of the Sally League, he won six of eight decisions and posted a 2.10 earned run average. After a one-game major-league trial late in 1962, Faul spent the entire season with the Tigers. Working as a swing man, he appeared in 28 games pitched, ten as a starter, won five of 11 decisions, had two complete games and one save.\nBut Faul also gained a reputation as one of his buttoned-up era's more free-spirited players and struggled under old-school manager Chuck Dressen after Dressen took command of the Tigers in mid-season. Faul spent all but one game of the campaign in Triple-A, where he compiled an outstanding win–loss record (11–1) but a high earned run average (4.05) for the Syracuse Chiefs. The Tigers then sold his contract to Cubs during spring training in .\nThe deal set up Faul's most successful big-league campaign. It began inauspiciously when he was roughed up during an April relief appearance against his hometown team, the Cincinnati Reds. The outing earned Faul another trip to Triple-A, where he spent two months in the Pacific Coast League. Recalled in July and eventually plugged into the second-division Cubs' starting rotation, Faul worked in 17 games (including 16 starts), threw five complete games and three shutouts, including a two-hitter and a three-hitter. The 1965 Cubs tied a major league record by turning three triple plays, and Faul was the pitcher on each occasion. At one point that season, Faul credited the success he was having to his having the ability to hypnotize himself and batters. For the year, Faul posted a 6–6 record and set a personal best with a 3.54 earned run average.\nHe began working out of the bullpen for the Cubs' new manager, Leo Durocher, but got a chance to start on May 1 against the Philadelphia Phillies at Wrigley Field. He defeated the Phils 6–1, registering what would be his final major league victory. He got in five more starts during the seasons first half, but was sent to Triple-A Tacoma in July. After spending 3 years in the minors, he surfaced in the majors again as a member of the Giants' bullpen, appearing in seven May games and registering one save. Then he was sent back to Triple-A, where he toiled through 1971. After sitting out the 1972 campaign, he made a final comeback in the Cubs' organization in 1973 before retiring.\nAll told, Faul appeared in 71 big-league games, including 33 starting assignments, over all or parts of six seasons. He won 12 games, lost 16, with eight complete games, three shutouts, and two saves. In 261 innings pitched he allowed 247 hits and 97 bases on balls, with 164 strikeouts. His career ERA was 4.72.\nPersonal life and death.\nFaul was a resident of Pleasant Plain, Ohio. He died at age 61 and is survived by his brother Jerry who still resides in Ohio."

        "text": "The UEFA second round was contested by the best eight runners-up from the nine first-round groups from the UEFA segment of the qualification tournament for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in football. The winners of each of four home and away ties joined the group winners in the World Cup in South Africa. The matches, which are often referred to as 'play-offs', were played on 14 and 18 November 2009. The draw for the ties was held in Zürich on 19 October, with the teams drawn by South African player Steven Pienaar.\nQualification.\nThe eight best runners-up from the UEFA first round qualified for the play-offs. With one group having one team fewer than the others, matches against the sixth-placed team in the group are not included in this ranking. \n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSeeding and draw.\nIn September 2009, FIFA announced that they would be seeding teams for the play-off draw. The eight eventual qualifiers were seeded according to the world rankings released on 16 October 2009. The top four teams were placed into one pot, with the bottom four teams placed into a second. A separate draw was conducted between each matchup to decide the host of the first leg.\nSeeding controversy.\nSeeding using FIFA ranks was used at a similar stage in the 2006 qualification. However, it was claimed that FIFA had indicated that there would be no seeding this time. At the time of the decision, countries in play-off positions included Russia, France and Portugal, and Germany also had not yet qualified (their last remaining match was away to Russia). The lack of a decision on seeding until late in the tournament led some to suggest that FIFA were waiting to see which teams were in the play-offs before declaring the rules of the tournament. Commenting on this matter, Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Shay Given said:\n\"Sports Illustrated\"'s Gabriele Marcotti gave the opinion that \"FIFA is pretty much changing the rules halfway through the qualifying tournament.\"\nSeedings.\nThe eight teams were seeded according to the FIFA World Rankings released on 16 October (shown in parentheses in the table below).\n&lt;section end=Seeding /&gt;\nMatches.\n\"France won 2–1 on aggregate.\"\nIreland officially asked FIFA for the second leg to be replayed after Thierry Henry clearly handled the ball twice during the build-up to the French goal. This request was denied. Ireland eventually pursued legal action against FIFA over the decision before ultimately receiving a €5 million settlement.\n\"Portugal won 2–0 on aggregate.\"\n\"Greece won 1–0 on aggregate.\"\n\"2–2 on aggregate; Slovenia won on away goals.\nAfter the game, Russian fans followed the Republic of Ireland's lead. They demanded a replay of their World Cup qualification play-off against Slovenia on the official site of FIFA. However, there was not any reaction from FIFA on this event."

He was also a professional sprinter and was an All-England Sprint Champion.\nRugby career.\nThomas joined first class team Newport in 1884 but did not represent Wales until December 1888 when he was selected to face the touring Māoris at St Helens. The Swansea crows was hostile towards the Wales team, as they believed that the Swansea team had been overlooked, and Thomas, along with Cardiff's Charlie Arthur received heavy censure. Despite the poor support from the crowd, Thomas had a good match and after William Towers had taken Wales into the lead, Thomas made the score comfortable by running in a try of his own from the halfway line. Not only strong in attack, Thomas was also commanding in defence, and when New Zealander Harold Lee dribbled the ball over the Wales' tryline, Thomas collected the ball, ran out of the try area with it before kicking the ball into the midfield. The move was described as an 'amazing show of nerve'\n. A week later Thomas faced the Māoris again, this time playing for club team, Newport. Led by Theo Harding, the Newport team was noticeably less physical than the New Zealanders, and the Welsh club lost the game by three tries to nil.\nThomas was not selected for the next Wales international game, and the Welsh selectors went through three different wings in the next four games before reselecting Thomas in the final game of the 1890 Home Nations Championship. Played against Ireland at Lansdowne Road, Wales were led by Arthur 'Monkey' Gould in a 3-3 draw. Thomas was replaced for the next game when Percy Lloyd returned, but was back in the squad just a game later when Wales faced Scotland as part of the 1891 Championship. Wales suffered an extremely heavy defeat by the Scots, and Thomas was not selected to represent his country again.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

The band had a unique way of performing: marching and cycling, hence the name \"Marching and Cycling Band HHK\".\nThe MaC-Band was a band that played music from the pop, musical and film worlds. They exercised weekly.\nThe band.\nOn average the band had between 20 and 25 performances a year, mostly in the periods April – June and September – October. Most performances were cycling, but marching performances were also executed.\nDuring the winter season there were a few performances and therefore the repertoire was (partially) updated. Also, the music for the marching show of the new season was studied.\nFrom 1995 until 2014, in the beginning of the season a so-called training weekend for the whole association was organised, in addition to practicing for the show that season in a different way. \nAs of 2009 the band has its own YouTube channel named MaCBandHHK where videos of the performances and other activities are published.\nPerforming on a bicycle.\nIn 1973 a member of the board, Bram Visser, got the idea to start performing with the marching band on bicycles, just like Dutch military bands had done years before. The first performance of this now well known band took place at the Grote Markt (central market square) during the March of Musicians of 1973. A yearly event that in those days took place in September in the evening. The performance was done on own and borrowed bicycles.\nAfter some hesitation by the rest of the board and due to the enormous success of the performance it was decided to buy 41 bicycles. The bicycle platoon existed for 41 years.\nThrough this way of making music the band gained fame in the Netherlands and abroad. Since those days the band was requested for many sorts of performances, from serenades to carnaval parades and international musical festivals. Often the band could be found in France, Belgium, Germany and The Netherlands, and also executed performances in England, Switzerland, Sweden and Luxembourg.\nHistory.\nThe HHK was founded in 1964 existing of a harmony orchestra, a marching band and a majorettes squad. At the end of the 1960s it was one of the largest music associations in Europe, with more than 200 members. The drum band started with natural instruments in the key of E-flat and percussion. The music was played on french horns, trumpets and sousaphones. The percussion consists of so-called march and / or snare drums, tenor drums and bass drums.\nThe harmony orchestra was a complete orchestra, including clarinets, trombones, trumpets and[french horns. Each year the association gave a concert in the Concert Hall of Haarlem. Most of the evening was filled with music played by the harmony, but the drum band and the majorettes also gave a performance. Usually, the evening ended with a joint work, played by the harmony and drum band together.\nIn October 2010, a youth department started, named Music-Kids, and in 2012 the visual group with majorettes and twirls was extended with a colorguard group.\nSpecial appearances.\nDuring the existence of the Marching and Cycling Band HHK there a number of specific actions were performed, including:"

        "text": "Carlos Narciso Quintana Hernandez (born August 26, 1965) is a former Major League Baseball player who played for the Boston Red Sox from 1988 to 1993.\nProfessional career.\nQuintana was signed by the Red Sox in 1984 as an undrafted free agent. Over the next four years he worked his way up the Red Sox minor league system playing for Elmira, Greensboro, New Britain and Pawtucket.\nHe made his first appearance for the Red Sox on September 16, 1988. He split the 1989 season between Pawtucket and Boston, and was named the full-time first baseman during spring training in 1990, beating out Bill Buckner for the job. Over the next two seasons Quintana earned a reputation as an outstanding defensive first baseman and an intelligent batter who maintained a high on-base percentage, albeit without much power or speed.\nIn February 1992, Quintana was involved in an automobile accident in the town of Tacarigua de Mamporal, Venezuela while rushing his two brothers to a hospital after they were shot at a party. In the accident, Quintana broke his left arm and his right big toe and his wife Solys broke both of her legs. The injuries caused Quintana to miss the entire 1992 season.\nQuintana returned to the Red Sox for the 1993 season but was still feeling the effects of the accident, including loss of feeling in his left thumb. He lost the starting first base position to Mo Vaughn and at the end of the season he announced his retirement from MLB baseball. However, he spent more than a season in the Venezuelan League, and played the season for the Buffalo Bisons, then a Triple-A affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates. In 1998 he played in Italy for Bbc Grosseto and hit four HR in a game against BC Modena.\nQuintana was a .276 hitter (380-for-1376) with 19 home runs and 165 runs batted in, including 163 runs, 59 doubles, one triple and three stolen bases, as well as a .350 on-base percentage and 498 total bases for a .362 slugging average.\nExternal links.\n, or Baseball Library, or Mexican League, or Venezuelan Baseball League"

He played college football as a guard for the Penn Quakers from 1893 to 1896, led the team to undefeated national championship seasons in 1894 and 1895, and was a three-time All-American. He later served in the Delaware Senate (1914–1918) and was the Democratic Party's candidate for Governor of Delaware in 1928. He was Penn's director of field athletics and assistant professor of physical education from 1919 to 1931 and head of the University of Delaware's physical education department from 1931 to 1937. He was posthumously inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1963.\nEarly years and education.\nWharton was born in 1871 at Magnolia, Delaware, the son of William W. Wharton and Amanda M. Layton Wharton. He attended the public schools of Smyrna, Delaware, and Professor Roe's Academy. He then enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania where he received degrees from the dental school in 1896 and from the medical school in 1899.\nCollege football.\nWhile at Penn, Wharton played college football at the guard position for the Penn Quakers football teams from 1893 to 1896. During his time with the Quakers, they compiled a 34-game winning streak, including perfect seasons in 1894 (12–0) and 1895 (14–0) and back-to-back national championships. He was captain of the 1896 team that compiled a 14–1 record. Wharton received first-team All-America honors for three consecutive years, being recognized as an All-American in 1894 by \"Leslie's Weekly\", in 1895 by Walter Camp and Caspar Whitney, and again in 1896 by Walter Camp.\nIn the College Football Hall of Fame biography of Wharton, he was called \"a blocking dynamo, often taking out entire sides of an enemy line in the style of an axe-swinging Paul Bunyan.\"\nLater years.\nWharton was active in politics, serving in the Delaware Senate from 1914 to 1918 and running unsuccessfully as the Democratic Party's candidate in the 1928 Delaware gubernatorial election. He also worked 12 years as Penn's director of field athletics and assistant professor of physical education. He resigned his position at Penn in 1931 when he was hired as the head of the University of Delaware's physical education department, a position he held for six years. In later years, Wharton served as the executive director of the Delaware Unemployment Compensation Commission.\nWharton died in 1949 at age 78 at his home in Dover, Delaware. In 1963, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. In 1978, he was inducted into the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame."

The team played its home games at Delmar Fieldhouse in Houston for the second consecutive season. This season marked the team's ninth year as an independent member of the NCAA's University Division. Houston was led by twelfth-year head coach Guy Lewis.\nDuring the regular season, the Elvin Hayes-fronted Cougars defeated the Lew Alcindor-led UCLA Bruins on January 20 in what was known as the Game of the Century. Houston attained a perfect 28–0 record for regular season, and finished with a 31–2 overall record, the first thirty-win season in program history. The Cougars finished first in both major polls, were invited to the NCAA tournament, and finished as a semifinalist. It was Houston's second consecutive Final Four appearance.\nFollowing the season, Elvin Hayes was drafted into the National Basketball Association by the San Diego Rockets as the first overall draft pick in the 1968 NBA draft.

        "title": "Miami RedHawks men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Miami RedHawks men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents Miami University, in Oxford, Ohio. The RedHawks are a member of the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC), starting play in the conference's 2013–14 inaugural season. Prior to the NCHC, from 1980 to 2013, the RedHawks were a member of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) until the original CCHA disbanded in 2013. They play in Steve \"Coach\" Cady Arena at the Goggin Ice Center.\nEarly Seasons.\nMiami University added hockey to the roster of varsity sports in 1978, with the leadership of the program's first coach, Steve Cady, playing at the Goggin Ice Arena. Miami played as an independent Division I team for the first two seasons, collecting an overall record of 45–27–3. The team joined the CCHA for the 1980–81 season. The first Miamian to play in the National Hockey League was goaltender Alain Chevrier, who played for Miami from 1980 to 1984, making his NHL debut with the New Jersey Devils in 1985, and left-wing Craig Fisher coming next in 1990 with the Philadelphia Flyers, having turned pro after two seasons in Oxford. Fisher was the first Miamian to be honored as first-team All-CCHA for his 1989-90 campaign.\nSuccess was fleeting until the 1992–93 season with a stellar 22-3-5 (.750) record and CCHA regular season title. Miami then capped a historic year for the program when, led by the third head coach in program history, George Gwozdecky, the team received its first bid to the NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. Miami was led by Chris Bergeron (61 points), Brian Savage (2nd-Team All-American, 37 goals), defenseman Bobby Marshall (2nd-Team All American, 45 points) and goalie Richard Shulmistra (2.71 GAA). The team lost in the first round to Wisconsin 3–1 at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan.\nMiami hockey reached another milestone in the 1994-95 season when goaltender Chuck Thuss became the first first-team All American. Thuss took an unusual path to the honor having been a back-up goaltender for 3 seasons, not playing a single minute for the Red and White until his outstanding senior season in which he posted 16 wins and a 2.87 GAA in 1983 minutes. Thuss was also honored by the CCHA in 1995 with the Terry Flanagan Memorial Award for demonstrating \"perseverance, dedication and courage while overcoming severe adversity\".\nGwozdecky had left Miami to coach the Denver Pioneers after the 1993-94 season, but successor Mark Mazzoleni took the 1996-97 team to the 1997 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament with a 27-11-3 record, led by defenseman Dan Boyle (first-team All-American, 54 points) and center Randy Robitaille (first-team All-American, 61 points). Miami lost to Cornell 4-2 in the regional quarterfinals played at Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\nThe Brotherhood.\nMark Mazzoleni left Miami to coach Harvard after the 1998-99 season. The RedHawks turned to former Miami player Enrico Blasi, who was working as an assistant coach at Denver under former Miami coach George Gwozdecky. Blasi, at the time, became the youngest head coach in Division I college hockey at 27 years old.\nBlasi established his program, calling it the Brotherhood, and brought the 23-14-4 (.610) 2003-04 RedHawks team to the 2004 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament, losing 3–2 in the regional semi-final to eventual national champions Denver at the World Arena in Colorado Springs. The team was led by Derek Edwardson (2nd-Team All-American, 48 points) and Greg Hogeboom (42 points).\nMiami began a streak of 8-straight NCAA tournament appearances when the 2005-06 team finished 26-9-4 (.718) behind first-team All-American Andy Greene and the stellar goaltending duo of Jeff Zatkoff (2.02 GAA) and Charlie Effinger (1.83 GAA). Miami lost to Boston College 5-0 in front of a partisan crowd in the regional semi-finals at the DCU Center in Worcester, Massachusetts, in the 2006 NCAA Tournament.\nThe RedHawks reached another level in 2006-07 with a 24-14-4 (.619) record, playing in the new Goggin Ice Center, advancing again to the 2007 NCAA Tournament, and winning their first NCAA tournament game, 2–1 over the top-seeded New Hampshire in the Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester, New Hampshire. Miami then lost to Boston College 4-0 in the regional final. The 2006-07 team was led by 2nd-Team All-American Nathan Davis (21 goals, 50 points). \nMiami followed up with a stellar campaign in 2007-08, 33-8-1 (.798), advancing to the 2008 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament, defeating Air Force, 3–2 in overtime, but then losing to eventual champions Boston College for the third year straight, 4–3 in overtime in the regional final. The team was paced by first-team All American Ryan Jones (31 goals, 49 points) and defenseman Alec Martinez (2nd-Team All-American).\nBack-to-Back Frozen Fours.\nin In 2009, the Red and White made their first appearance in the Frozen Four. The team finished the regular season with a 23-13-5 (.622) record, entering the post-season as a 4-seed in the 4-team regional in Minneapolis. Miami beat top-seed Denver 4-2 in the opening round and then Minnesota-Duluth 2-1 to advance to the Frozen Four at the Verizon Center in Washington, D.C. The RedHawks beat Bemidji State 4-1 in the national semifinal game, advancing to the championship game against Boston University. Trailing 3-1 with just 3:23 to go in the third period, Boston University pulled their goaltender and forced overtime with a goal by Terrier Zach Cohen with just 17 seconds remaining. BU then scored 11:47 into overtime with a goal by Colby Cohen to secure the national title. The 2009 team was led by 2nd-Team All-American Carter Camper (42 points) and the goaltending of Connor Knapp (2.09 GAA) and Cody Reichard (2.11 ERA).\nTragedy struck the program and school on Friday February 5, 2010, when Miami student hockey manager, Brendan Burke, the son of Toronto Maple Leafs GM Brian Burke, and a friend/passenger died in a traffic accident on icy winter roads in South-Central Indiana. Burke had become an advocate for LGBT awareness with the support of Coach Blasi and the Miami team. The Burke family formed the You Can Play campaign, dedicated to the eradication of homophobia, in sports, to carry on the work of Brendan. The team remained strong in the wake of the accident, using the tragedy as inspiration on the ice. The team scored 10 goals the following night against Lake Superior State University. And on February 12, 2010, after a victory over Bowling Green State University, the RedHawks claimed their third CCHA regular-season title in program history.\nThe 2009-10 Miami squad would again advance to the Frozen Four, defeating Alabama-Huntsville 2-1 in the opening round of the Midwest Regional at the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, and then beating Michigan 3–2 in double-overtime, when Alden Hirschfeld scored 1:54 into the second extra period. Miami then lost to post-season nemesis Boston College 7-1 in the Frozen Four semi-finals at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan. The team was led by goaltender Cody Reichard (2nd-Team All-American (1.87 GAA), right-wing Jarod Palmer (45 points), and center Tommy Wingels (42 points).\nFinal CCHA Seasons.\nThe RedHawks finished the 2010–11 regular season ranked third in the CCHA, 23-10-6 (.667), giving the team a first round bye in the 2011 CCHA Tournament. The RedHawks faced Alaska in the second round and swept Alaska by a combined score of 8–2. The RedHawks then beat Notre Dame 6–2 in semifinal round and dismantled the Western Michigan Broncos 5-2 in the championship to give the university its first Mason Cup. After the strong finish in the regular season the team was ranked as a #1 seed in the 2011 NCAA Tournament. The RedHawks were placed into the Northeast Regional at the Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester, New Hampshire. In the opening round of the tournament the team faced the 4th-seeded New Hampshire Wildcats and lost 3–1 in front of a pro-New Hampshire crowd.\nMiami senior forward Andy Miele (first-team All-American) was named as the 2011 Hobey Baker Award winner, becoming the university's first Hobey Baker winner. Miele lead the nation in scoring with 71 points (24 goals and 47 assists). It was the most in Division I since the 2002–03 season and 11 more than the second highest scorer in the 2010–11 season. In addition, he had at least one point in 33 games and multiple points in 22 and tied a school record with a 17-game points streak from January 8, 2011, to March 19, 2011.\nIn July 2011, following the announcement in June 2011 that the Big Ten Conference will begin sponsoring men's ice hockey, the athletic directors of Miami and five other schools, Colorado College, the University of Denver, the University of Minnesota Duluth, the University of Nebraska Omaha, and the University of North Dakota, announced the formation of the National Collegiate Hockey Conference. Miami would remain in the CCHA until the NCHC began play in the 2013–14 season.\nThe 2011–12 season marked another return to the CCHA Semifinals at Joe Louis Arena and seventh straight appearance in the NCAA Tournament. The RedHawks finished the season with a record of 24–15–2 (.610). Despite a slow start to the season that included a five-game winless streak through October, they finished the regular season with a six-game win streak and, despite a loss in the CCHA semifinals, the RedHawks received an at-large bid to the 2012 NCAA Tournament, seeded second in the East Regional at the Webster Bank Arena in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Miami played the third-seeded UMass Lowell in the opening round in the tournament. The RedHawks rallied in the third period to overcome a three-goal deficit and tie the game to force overtime. The RedHawks season was ended just over two minutes into overtime when UMass Lowell forward Riley Wetmore capitalized on a rebound to give UMass Lowell a 4–3 win. Miami was led on the season by Reilly Smith (first-team All-American, 30 goals, 48 points).\nMiami would play one last season in the old CCHA in 2012-13, 25-12-5 (.655), winning the regular season title and advancing yet again to the NCAA Tournament, placed in the Midwest Regional at the Huntington Center in Toledo, Ohio. Miami dominated Minnesota State 4-0 in the first round, but lost the regional final to St. Cloud State 4-1. Austin Czarnik (14 goals), Blake Coleman (19 points) and the goaltending duo of Ryan McKay and Jay Williams led a balanced RedHawks squad.\nMoving to the NCHC.\nMiami moved to the newly formed NCHC in 2013 and returned to their winning ways in the second NCHC season, finishing the season 25–14–1 (.638) and taking the NCHC post-season tournament title. The Red and White entered the 2015 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament as a top-seed but drew the unfavorable position of playing a host team, Providence, on their home ice at the Dunkin' Donuts Center in Providence, Rhode Island, dropping the opener 7–5 to the Friars, who would make an improbable run to the national title. Miami pulled their goalie for much of the third period after trailing 6–2, but a furious third period rally came up short. Austin Czarnik (2nd-Team All-American, 36 assists, 45 points), Riley Barber (20 goals, 40 points), and Blake Coleman (37 points) led the Red and White.\nThe Brotherhood began to fracture in the depth of the new conference, and Enrico Blasi was dismissed by his alma mater at the conclusion of the 2018–19 season, their 4th losing season in a row. Miami then tapped former RedHawk Chris Bergeron, who played with Blasi and then served as his assistant coach before becoming the head coach at Bowling Green in 2010. Bergeron helped to restore that program, which was on the verge of being shut down, taking the Falcons to the 2019 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament in his final season at BG. Bergeron has had a rough go of it at Miami with a 28-90-13 record and a 17-71-9 conference record. Blasi was hired in 2021 as the coach of the St. Thomas Tommies, their first NCAA Division I coach as they move up from Division III. St. Thomas plays in a newly re-formed CCHA conference.\nOn March 19, 2024, reports came out that head coach Chris Bergeron would be relieved of his duties. The RedHawks failed to win more than eight games in any of the five seasons while he was at the helm, and they ended the 2023-2024 campaign on a 16-game winless streak, their second-longest drought in team history. His .257 winning percentage (35-116-16) is the worst among any Miami hockey coach, and his teams were 0-7 in the NCHC Tournament.\nStatistical leaders.\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nPlayers.\nAll-Americans.\nThe following players have been named First or Second Team All-Americans by the American Hockey Coaches Association:\nConference awards.\nThe following RedHawk players won a major conference award:\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of Miami alumni were a part of an Olympic team.\nRedHawks in the NHL.\nSource:\nSchool records.\nThe following are the Miami school records.

        "title": "Alaska Nanooks men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Alaska Nanooks men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The Nanooks are an independent program. They play at the Carlson Center in Fairbanks, Alaska.\nHistory.\nEarly history (1925–1973).\nVarsity hockey at Alaska-Fairbanks began in 1925. The team played four games during the inaugural 1925–26 season and finished the season with a 3–1–0 record despite having no coach. The program returned in 1932 and for three additional seasons the team operated without a coach as an independent collegiate program. Alfred Bastress joined the Nanooks in 1937 and became the program's first head coach. Bastress led the Nanooks for four seasons. The team played the 1939–40 season again with no coach and Joe Gerlach coached the team during the 1941–42 season, splitting both games the team played that season. The program was suspended during World War II and returned for the 1949–50 season.\nThe team went through six coaches through the 1950s before Bill Daltri took over behind the bench in 1960. Daltri led the Nanooks for three seasons, including some of the most successful seasons of the early history of the program. In 1960–61 Daltri's Nanooks finished with a record of 14–2–0 and in the 1961–62 season the team finished 10–1–1. In his final season as head coach Daltri's Nanooks won all 8 games of the 1962–63 season. The program would go through another period of coaching turnovers, going through 9 coaches in a ten-year period from 1963–1973.\nDivision II era (1973–1984).\nFollowing the 1972–73 season the program moved from the University Division to NCAA Division II, when the different levels became numerically organized. Between '74 and '80 the Nanooks played just two seasons as a varsity program and continued to have trouble scheduling opponents. After a reinvestment in the program, Ric Schafer took over as head coach in 1980 and began to build the Nanooks into a respectable team. After winning just twice in his first two seasons, Schafer got the team to post a program-record 19 wins in 1983 and then produce back-to-back 20+ win seasons immediately afterwards. In 1984, the entire Division II ice hockey level collapsed and, while most programs dropped down to Division III, Alaska promoted the ice hockey team to Division I.\nGreat West Hockey Conference and independence (1985–1994).\nAfter a year as an independent program, The Nanooks joined with in-state rival Alaska-Anchorage as well as U.S. International University (San Diego) and Northern Arizona University (Flagstaff, Arizona) to form the Great West Hockey Conference.\nThough small to begin with, the GWHC shrunk when Northern Arizona suspended their varsity program after the first season. The conference lasted just three years in total, but it was long enough for Alaska's new head coach, Don Lucia, to lead the team to its first ever conference title in 1988.\nU.S. International followed Northern Arizona into ice hockey oblivion in 1988, leaving the two Alaska schools to play as independents for several years. With Alaska being so far away from most other Division I programs, the NCAA does not include any games played against either school as part of a team's game limit during the season. This enabled Alaska to survive during the early 1990s and post three separate 20-win seasons.\nCCHA / WCHA (1994–2021).\nin 1994, while Anchorage joined the WCHA, Alaska was invited to participate as an affiliate member of the CCHA. While none of their games were counted in the conference standings, the stabilization of their schedule provided a solid footing for the Nanooks to build their program.\nDave Laurion, who had replaced Lucia in 1993, led Alaska for their early tenure in the CCHA but couldn't get the team out of the cellar. Guy Gadowsky was brought in in 1999 and raised the profile of the Nanooks after a few lean years. Gadowsky left to take over at Princeton in 2004 and the program began to slip back down the standings until Dallas Ferguson was introduced in 2008. In just his second season with the program, Ferguson led the Nanooks to their first ever NCAA Tournament appearance and kept the team in good standing for most of his 9-years with the program.\n2011 saw significant changes for the program, beginning with the announcement by the Big Ten Conference that it would begin sponsoring men's ice hockey in 2013. While that would cause three teams from the CCHA to leave for their primary conference, Miami joined with five other schools from the WCHA to form a separate conference, the NCHC. The CCHA disintegration continued when Northern Michigan was approved for membership in the WCHA, and the conference began scrambling to find a way to survive.\nOn August 23, 2011 members of the WCHA and CCHA met in Chicago, Illinois in reaction to the realignment. Afterwards, the WCHA sent invitations to the five remaining CCHA schools and Alaska quickly accepted the invitation to join the league for the 2013–14 season.\nLater in the year, administrative officials at Alaska discovered that the school had failed to properly monitor the academic eligibility of several players from multiple sports dating back to 2007. The violations were immediately brought to the attention of the NCAA and an investigation began to determine the size and scope of the failure. In 2014 the NCAA concluded their findings and determined that UAF was 'lacking in institutional control' and had failed to update an 'inadequate compliance system' despite warnings to that effect. The majority of the violations were from players either not declaring a major, not accruing enough credits towards their declared major(s) or junior college transfers failing to meet academic eligibility standards. The school admitted guilt and was required to pay a fine, suspend several scholarships and forfeit all wins and ties in games where ineligible players participated. As a result, the ice hockey program now has no wins from 2007–08 through the 2011–12 season and was forced to vacate their lone NCAA tournament appearance in 2010. Alaska was also ruled ineligible for participation during the 2015 postseason.\nThe second decade of the 20th century continued to be unkind to the Nanooks; despite finishing with winning records during several seasons, Alaska lost every single playoff round they participated in from 2011 through 2020. In 2019, seven teams from the WCHA announced that they would be leaving the conference to form a more geographically-cohesive conference. With Alaska being approximately 3,000 miles away from the nearest opponent (excluding Anchorage) the Nanooks were in jeopardy of returning to independent status. Then, as if to add insult to injury, Alaska was forced to cancel its entire 2020-21 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All of this was also happening under a cloud of financial hardship caused by state budget crunch. The funding for the program became so tenuous that a proposal was circulated to merge the Nanooks with the Seawolves in order to save money. The plan never came to pass but constraints eventually led to the temporary suspension of Alaska Anchorage's program.\nWilderness years (2021–present).\nWhen Alaska returned to the ice in 2021, they did so as an independent. The only saving grace for their position was that they were not alone in that situation. Alaska was able to schedule several meetings with the other two conference-free programs (Arizona State and Long Island) and put together a solid season with a 14-18-2 record after starting the season with only one win in their first 13 competitive games.\nBrice Alaska Goal Rush.\nThe Brice Alaska Goal Rush is one of two annual ice hockey tournaments (along with the Kendall Hockey Classic) that are traditionally played in the first two weeks of the NCAA Division-I season. The Kendall tournament opens the season, and the Alaska Goal Rush is played in the second week. The tournament is held at the Carlson Center in Fairbanks, Alaska, and is hosted by University of Alaska-Fairbanks hockey team.\nThe tournament takes place over two days and follows a round robin format. The hockey team from the University of Alaska-Anchorage is a regular participant and serves as an unofficial co-host, while two guest schools round out the tournament field every year. Each of the Alaska schools plays one game against the guest teams, but do not play against each other. The invitees do not square off either. The first criteria to determine place order are records, and then goal-differential in the event of any ties.\nThe tournament began in the fall of 2008, and its title is a play on the historical Alaska Gold Rush. Fairbanks has won the tournament four times (most recently in 2013), and Anchorage has won it twice. No guest team has been able to win the crown yet in its six-year history.\nCoaches.\nTypically, Alaska has not had much luck in keeping their coaches for very long. The program has had 26 different head coaches in 69 seasons from 1925 to 2018 and played six of those years without a bench boss. This is not only the most overall for any Division I hockey team but it is among the lowest average (2.65 years) for any school in any sport. As of 2018 Dallas Ferguson was the longest-tenured coach in the history of the program, serving for 9 seasons.\nAll-time coaching records.\n†\nNanooks in the NHL.\nSource:"

The AL regained the lead 4–3 in the seventh. Elston Howard was hit by a pitch by Turk Farrell, took third on a Rocky Colavito double and scored on Fregosi's sacrifice fly.\nIt remained 4–3 until the bottom of the ninth. Dick Radatz issued a leadoff walk to Willie Mays, who stole second. Orlando Cepeda singled him home with the tying run and took second on an error. With Curt Flood pinch-running for Cepeda and Johnny Edwards on first with an intentional walk, Johnny Callison's three-run homer to deep right field ended the game.\nRoster.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nNational League.\nx – replaced due to injury\ny – replacement for injured player"

        "text": "Men's ice hockey tournaments have been staged at the Olympic Games since 1920. The men's tournament was introduced at the 1920 Summer Olympics, and permanently added to the Winter Olympic Games in 1924. Canada has participated in 21 of 23 tournaments, sending 38 goaltenders and 307 skaters.\nFor the first 40 years of the tournament, Canada did not have a national team, instead choosing to send a club team, typically the Allan Cup winner. In 1960, the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen became the final club team to represent Canada at the Olympics. In 1962, Canada implemented a national team program, led by Father David Bauer. Between 1920 and 1952, seven Olympic ice hockey tournaments were held and Canada won six gold medals and a silver in 1936. The Soviet Union began competing in 1956 and frequently defeated the Canadian team. The Soviets won seven gold medals in nine tournaments; during that period Canada won a silver and two bronze medals. The Olympic Games were originally intended for amateur athletes, so the players of the National Hockey League (NHL) and other professional leagues were not allowed to compete. Many of Canada's top players were professional, so the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) pushed for the ability to use professional and amateur players. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) refused, and Canada withdrew from the 1972 and 1976 Olympics in protest. In 1986, the IOC voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games, starting in 1988. The NHL decided not to allow all players to participate in 1988, 1992 or 1994, because doing so would force the league to halt play during the Olympics. An agreement was reached in 1995 that allowed NHL players to compete in the Olympics, starting with the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan. National teams are co-ordinated by Hockey Canada and players are chosen by the team's management staff. In 2018, NHL players were not allowed to participate.\nCanada has won nine gold, four silver and two bronze medals in men's ice hockey, more than any other nation. Seventeen players have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, twelve into the IIHF Hall of Fame and eight into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame. The Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame has inducted three individuals and five gold medal winning teams: the 1920 Winnipeg Falcons, 1948 RCAF Flyers, 1952 Edmonton Mercurys and the 2002 and 2010 national teams. Two players—Martin Brodeur and Chris Pronger—have played on four teams. Nine others—Rob Blake, Adam Foote, Jarome Iginla, Eric Lindros, Roberto Luongo, Terry O'Malley, Rick Nash, Joe Sakic and Wally Schreiber—have played on three teams. According to the IOC database, 252 men have won medals; 15 players—Brodeur, Patrice Bergeron, Sidney Crosby, Drew Doughty, Ryan Getzlaf, Iginla, Duncan Keith, Roberto Luongo, Patrick Marleau, Nash, Scott Niedermayer, Corey Perry, Pronger, Jonathan Toews and Shea Weber—have won two gold medals. Eight others players—Lindros, Schreiber, Fabian Joseph, Brad Schlegel, Paul Kariya, Ken Laufman, Floyd Martin and Donald Rope—have won two medals. Chris Pronger holds the record for most games played, having dressed for 25 games in four Olympics between 1998 and 2010. Wally Schreiber is second in games played, with 24 games in 1988, 1992 and 1994. Harry Watson leads Canadian Olympians in goals, having scored 36 goals in 1924 (before assists were counted); Walter Halder scored 29 points (21 goals and 8 assists) in 1948; and Ken Laufman recorded 14 assists in 1956 and 1960.\nGoaltenders.\nReserve goaltenders.\nThese goaltenders were named to the Olympic roster, but did not receive any ice time during games. Martin Brodeur and Curtis Joseph did not play in any games at the 1998 Winter Olympics, but did start games at later tournaments.\nSkaters.\nReserve skaters.\nThese players were named to the Olympic roster, but did not play in any games.\nNote 1.

The Jayhawks finished the season 33–3, 15–1 in Big 12 play to capture the Big 12 regular season championship. They also won the 2010 Big 12 men's basketball tournament to earn the conference's automatic bid to the 2010 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. They earned the #1 overall seed in the entire tournament and were the 1 seed in the Midwest Region. They defeated 16 seed Lehigh in the first round and were upset by 9 seed Northern Iowa in the second round.\nPre-Season.\nOn April 13, 2009, key players Sherron Collins and Cole Aldrich announced that they would forgo the NBA draft and return for the 2009–10 season.

On April 9, Quintrell Thomas and Tyrone Appleton announced their intention to transfer to other schools due to lack of available playing time. Appleton averaged 0.8 points on 2.2 minutes per game in 2008–09 and Thomas averaged 1.5 points on 5.4 minutes.\nThomas announced that he will be joining the UNLV squad, however will not be eligible to play until the 2010–11 season.

Due to the influx of western workers, rugby has experienced a form of revival and for a while had a significant number of Saudi nationals playing.\nSaudi Arabia participated in the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea. On 29 April 2016 Saudi Arabia played against Jordan in their first World Rugby recognized international game.\nSaudi Rugby Federation has no recognized clubs in the kingdom, however there are currently 6 teams in Saudi Arabia:\nIn November 2012, a national team consisting only of Saudi nationals entered the West Asia 7's competition in Dubai. They finished 3rd overall with Lebanon taking the title."

In Japan, the game features Hideo Nomo on the cover and is called \"Nomo's World Series Baseball\" in English and \"Nomo Hideo no World Series Baseball\" in Japanese.\nGameplay.\nThe game allows players to put teams involved in the 1994 Major League Baseball season in either exhibition, regular season, or playoff mode.\nThis video game also permits the player to create two customized teams with their choice of their favorite players (no luxury taxes unlike the modern baseball games). At the conclusion of the regular season there are awards given out for MVP, along with the Cy Young Award, the Triple Crown, amongst other awards that are dependent on regular season statistics. Also, players are selected to the All-Star Game purely based on statistics from the first half of the regular season. Unlocking a code allows a fictional team in exhibition mode. The players are asked how many innings they want to play and if they need a designated hitter prior to starting the game among other options like an optional digitized voice (for all the umpire's decisions) and the way that the game is viewed (front or back).\nReception.\n\"World Series Baseball '95\" was met with critical acclaim. Quick-Draw McGraw of \"GamePro\" applauded the Game Gear version for having \"a ton of options that're usually seen only on 16-bit systems.\" He criticized the music and the limited vocabulary of the digitized voice, but nonetheless decreed it \"one of the premiere sports games on the Game Gear.\" Writing for the same publication, Bacon was similarly enthusiastic about the Genesis version, citing the added modes and improved graphics over the original \"World Series Baseball\". \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" also gave the Genesis version a rave review, commenting that \"The best baseball game of all time has been made better.\" Both their sports reviewers gave it a 9 out of 10. A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" similarly said that \"The first \"WSB\" was the best baseball game of '94 and the '95 version looks even better.\" Particularly praising the comprehensive modes and content and the new multiplayer leagues, he gave it four out of five stars.\nFor the 32X version, \"Next Generation\" reviewed the 32X version of the game, rating it five stars out of five, and stated, \"\"World Series '95\" for the 32X isn't much better than its 16-bit counterpart, but it's easily the best baseball game available. This one won't disappoint.\" \"GamePro\", however, criticized the release as being minimally improving over the Genesis version."

After spending his first professional season with American Hockey League affiliate the Texas Stars, Bachman was called up to Dallas in the following 2010–11 season on December 8, 2011. Bachman was called to back up Andrew Raycroft after the Stars' primary goalie, Kari Lehtonen, was placed on the Injury Reserve. He then made his debut with the Stars that day. With the Stars, Bachman started a trend for his goalie masks to \nhave a theme of \"The Shining\", acknowledging that \"Richard Bachman\" was also a pen name for \"Shining\" author Stephen King.\nAfter he was initially reassigned to the Texas Stars to begin the 2011–12 season, Bachman was recalled a month into the season and replaced Andrew Raycroft as the primary backup to Kari Lehtonen. On December 13, 2011, Bachman earned his first NHL shutout, blanking the New York Rangers 1–0.\nEdmonton Oilers.\nOn July 6, 2013, Bachman signed a one-year deal with the Edmonton Oilers after becoming a free agent.

In the 2013-14 NHL season Bachman suffered a hamstring injury and was eventually sent down to Oklahoma City, where he would play for the remainder of the season.\nVancouver Canucks.\nOn July 1, 2015, Bachman signed as a free agent to a two-year contract with the Vancouver Canucks. Relegated to third goalie, Bachman only played one game for the Canucks and spent most of the season in the AHL, playing for the Utica Comets; the following season was spent entirely with the Comets.\nOn July 13, 2016, Bachman signed a contract extension to stay with Vancouver through 2018. On June 20, 2018, Bachman signed a two-year, two-way contract to remain with the Canucks organization through 2020.\nWhile playing with Utica, Bachman suffered an Achilles injury which prematurely ended his 2018–19 AHL season on December 21, 2018.\nIn the following 2019–20 season, Bachman through injury found himself as the Comet's third choice upon recovery. Limited to just 3 games, while in the final season of his contract, Bachman sought and was loaned by the Canucks to Swedish club, IK Oskarshamn of the Swedish Hockey League, for the remainder of the season on February 12, 2020. He made just 3 appearances in Sweden, going winless, before the season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCoaching career.\nOn October 2, 2020, Bachman announced his retirement from professional hockey after 11 seasons and became the goaltending coach for the Iowa Wild in the AHL."

Other medal contenders are Bahamians Debbie Ferguson-McKenzie and Chandra Sturrup, and Kelly-Ann Baptiste, who have all run under eleven seconds prior to the tournament.\nJeter was the fastest qualifier in the heats, and finished 0.02 seconds outside her personal best to win her quarter-final. Stewart was the fastest in the quarterfinals with 10.92 seconds, and Campbell-Brown won her race as the third athlete to run under eleven seconds that day. On the second day of competition, Shelly-Ann Fraser ran the fastest ever semi-final in 10.79 seconds, with Stewart just behind in 10.84 seconds. Jeter ran a personal best of 10.83 seconds to reach the final, in which half the competitors were Jamaican.\nIn the final, a quick start saw Fraser lead from the outset of the race and Stewart's late challenge was not enough to beat her compatriot. Stewart's personal-best-equalling 10.75 seconds earned her the silver medal, and Jeter took the bronze with a 10.90 second run, somewhat short of the time she produced in the semi-finals. The 2007 gold and silver medallists ran season's bests but missed out on the medals, with Campbell-Brown in fourth (10.95) and Williams in fifth (11.01). Fraser's win in 10.73 seconds was a Jamaican record and made her the joint third fastest 100 m athlete ever with Christine Arron. Furthermore, she became only the second woman to win consecutive Olympic and World Championship titles, after Gail Devers. As amazing as her start appeared, Fraser only had the fourth fastest reaction time in the field.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the following records were as follows.\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 3 in each heat(Q) and the next 5 fastest(q) advance to the quarterfinals.\nQuarterfinals.\nQualification: First 3 in each heat(Q) and the next 4 fastest(q) advance to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nFirst 4 of each Semifinal qualified directly (Q) for the final."

First held in 1883, these tournaments are considered to be the first championship ice hockey tournaments and the predecessor to the first championship ice hockey league, the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada.\nHistory.\nIn 1883, the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association was asked to add sports to the events to be held with the Montreal Carnival. The association was affiliated with the Montreal Snow Shoe Club. Along with the McGill Hockey Club, they organized a four-team tournament, played partly outdoors on the Saint Lawrence River. The trophy for this tournament is on display at the McCord Museum in Montreal. In 1884, the location changed to a rink made on the McGill University grounds. It was moved indoors subsequently. The carnival was not held in 1886 and 1888.\nIn December 1886, the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada was founded by the four Montreal teams (McGill, Montreal Hockey Club, Montreal Crystals, Montreal Victorias) and the Ottawa Hockey Club.\nSeason-by-season record.\n1883.\nThe carnival was held from January 23 to 28. Montreal, McGill and Quebec teams contested the trophy and McGill won the tournament.

The outdoor rink was unplayable on February 6 and the Crystals and Wanderers did not show at the rink for their games. Both teams lost by default although the games could not have been played.\nThe tournament was the first appearance of the Ottawa Hockey Club (which would eventually field a team in the National Hockey League) in competitive play.

It was scheduled to begin on February 15, 1886 and featured five days of winter sports activities. A committee from the club had been visiting Montreal to obtain attractions for the carnival as well as gain tips on how to manage the event. The Montreal Snow Shoe Club, along with several organisations from Montreal were invited to the carnival to participate in the events. The Montreal Crystals and the Montreal Hockey Club accepted the invitation, as did the Ottawa Hockey Club, which later withdrew due to scheduling conflicts. A local team was quickly assembled from the employees of the Van Ness House, a hotel in Burlington. Montreal HC won the gold medal, and the Crystals won the silver. Originally scheduled for February 15–19, the organizers were forced to move the events one week later due to unseasonable weather. The carnival was held on February 22–26. The hockey games were played on Lake Champlain in heavy wind. The first game was played on the morning of February 26, with two 20-minute halves. There was no score through 40 minutes, and Montreal's R. Smith scored in overtime. The second game was between Montreal HC and Van Ness House, and it was the first international ice hockey game. The players representing Van Ness House did not have any hockey experience, having only gone through a few practices prior to the carnival. The two teams played two 15-minute periods, with Montreal winning 3–0 and thus claiming the gold medal. The final game was played in two 10-minute periods, with Joseph McGoldrick of the Crystals scoring the only goal to capture the silver medal.\n\"Montreal wins Winter Carnival Tournament\"\nSource: \"Lord Stanley: The Man Behind the Cup\" ()\nRosters.\nThe following players were part of the hockey teams participating in the 1886 Burlington Winter Carnival.\nVan Ness House: Lewis C.

Fiji's fate in the tournament came down to a \"winner advances\" game against Wales which Fiji won 38–34 and qualified for the quarter-finals for the second time. Former Wallaby great Michael Lynagh described the see-sawing match as one of the best matches \"of all time\". Fiji lost their quarter final match against South Africa, however their above expectations performance in the tournament resulted in them moving up to 9th in the world rankings – their highest ever position.\nHosting.\nSo far Fiji has not hosted any World Cup games, and has not put in bids for future tournaments. Due to the lack of facilities, and the small size of the island nation, but hopefully it will host it in the near future."

They are so far the only team to reach the Rugby World Cup through Asian regional qualifying. In 2019, they progressed to the quarterfinals for the first time in their participation, making them the first Asian team to do so in the tournament.\nTheir best performance was in the 2015 Rugby World Cup. Japan beat South Africa 34–32 in their first match of pool play, in what was described as the \"greatest Rugby World Cup shock ever\". They went on to beat Samoa and the United States in pool play. They won three games out of four in pool play, the same as Scotland and South Africa, but unlike the other two, Japan did not get any bonus points, so the other two qualified for the quarter-finals.\nJapan's first victory was a 52–8 win over Zimbabwe at the 1991 tournament under coach Hiroaki Shukuzawa. Their worst defeat came at the 1995 Rugby World Cup, when they lost to New Zealand by 145–17, in a defeat blamed for setting the development of rugby union in Japan back by several years.\nSince then, in the 2003 World Cup, held in Australia, Japan coached by Shogo Mukai was hailed as the best of the so-called 'minnow' nations, gaining many new Japanese and overseas fans in the process, though the team still failed to win any games. In the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Japan managed a last-minute conversion to draw with Canada, and avoided coming last in Pool B.

The Eagles, ranked 13th in the world standings, lost all 4 games in Pool A, scoring 1 bonus point in the game against Samoa. Coached by New Zealander Peter Thorburn, the Eagles started off with tough match against the defending world champions England, losing 28–10. The US was then beaten by Tonga 25–15, lost to Samoa 25 – 21, and lost their final match to highly favored South Africa 64 – 15. The Eagles, however, had a major highlight in the South Africa match. After an interception and a pair of passes, Takudzwa Ngwenya sped down the sideline and outran Bryan Habana, arguably the fastest man in world rugby, to score a try that received Try of the Year honors at the 2007 IRB Awards.\n2011 Rugby World Cup.\nChris Wyles was the USA's leading scorer of the 2011 tournament with 18 points (1 try, 3 penalties, 2 conversions).\nMike Petri, Paul Emerick, and JJ Gagiano each scored 5 points (1 try) for the US.\n30 Man Squad:\nThe Eagles showed tremendous fight and power in their World Cup opening match against Ireland emotionally charged as the game coincided with the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. The Irish came out strong but the Eagles were stiff in defense. The Irish suffered from poor goal kicking and were only able to gain a 3–0 lead before finally scoring their first try at the 39' mark to take a 10-0 half-time lead. The Irish came out more ready to play in the second half but still ran into stiff Eagles defense. Ultimately the Irish scored two more tries to give a final tally of 22 points. The Eagles succeeded in frustrating Irish expectations to gain a bonus point with a full strength squad and managed to post 10 points led by an interception try on full-time by Paul Emerick.\nThe Eagles came into the World Cup with their measuring mark for success as being a win over Russia. The Eagles did not disappoint. Russia leaped out to an early 3–0 lead after a penalty goal from inside the 22 set up by a block on a Mike Petri box kick. The Americans took a 10–3 lead into the half after a break by Andrew Suniula set up a try for Mike Petri. The kicking duty fell upon Chris Wyles who capitalized on his first kick, a deep strike in poor conditions from the 10 meter line. Wyles was also successful on a conversion and with his last attempt at goal. He did, however, miss 3 kicks at goal and a drop goal. Russia would land once more on the board to snatch a bonus point from the match but fell to the final tally of USA 13–6 Russia. Both Wyles and Mike MacDonald had amazing matches as McDonald scooped up the man of the match accolades. The Eagles were absolutely dominant at the lineout winning 7 of Russia's 13 throws and winning all 12 of their own throws. The win elevated the Eagles back up to 17th in the IRB rankings and dropped Russia one spot to 21st.\nFor their third match the Eagles trotted out a squad with 14 changes from the one that met Russia, ensuring that each player on the roster received a cap in the tournament. Australia got on the board early with tries at the 7- and 10-minute marks, but the Eagles answered with a JJ Gagiano try at the 22nd minute that cut the deficit to 10–5. Australia quickly responded with two more tries to take a 22–5 lead into the half along with clinching a bonus point. In the second half the Wallabies jumped on the Eagles leading to the final result of 67–5. This was the worst defeat a US team has ever suffered to Australia.\nThe final match saw the Eagles playing for a 3rd-place finish in Pool C and an automatic qualification into the 2015 Rugby World Cup. The Eagles faced Italy (the Azzurri) and the scoring began early by the Azzurri, but the Eagles struck back with a Chris Wyles try and conversion to level the match 7-7. The Italians struck quickly with their second try, and scored their third try on the stroke of halftime to lead 20-10 at the half. Italy focused their second-half efforts on scoring a fourth try and the bonus point. The US second-half defense held for 25 minutes, but after tremendous pressure by the Italian scrum - which Italy dominated all match - the Azzurri got their fourth try and the bonus point in the 65th minute. That try and conversion were the only points for the Azzurri in the second half. The defeat marked the end of the 2011 Rugby World Cup and the 2011 season for the Eagles.\n2015 Rugby World Cup.\nU.S. summer preparations for the World Cup included four matches at the 2015 Pacific Nations Cup plus two additional World Cup warm-up matches. The U.S. earned three wins and three losses over these matches, with wins against Canada (twice) and Japan.\nAt the World Cup, the U.S. lost its first match against Samoa 16–25. The Eagles suffered from ill discipline, committing 14 penalties (compared to 7 for Samoa); and from poor tackling, with a 79% tackle success rate and 29 missed tackles, (compared to Samoa's 86% tackle rate and 19 missed tackles).\nThe team entered World Cup play with the highest hopes in years. The pool draw placed the Eagles alongside Japan, a team they had beaten earlier in the summer, Samoa, a team they've played well in the past, and Scotland. Scotland, though a tier 1 nation, had struggled in recent years. The last team was South Africa, a team that lost its first match of the World Cup to Japan.\nIn their opening match against Samoa, the United States trailed 14–8 at the half, and ultimately fell 25–16, after finding tremendous difficulties at the lineout and in the scrum.\nCarrying a tough 0–1 start into the team's second match, the Eagles made history by claiming a first ever halftime lead over a tier 1 nation (13–6), on the back of a strong showing in the scrum. The second half was less kind, as Scotland quickly overcame the deficit and pushed the final score well out of reach: Scotland 39, USA 16.\nWith a winless campaign becoming a real possibility, the coaching staff chose a roster that drastically differed from the starters in the first two matches. Against South Africa, the Eagles struggled early and were dominated in the scrum, but kept the match close at the break with South Africa holding a 14-point lead. In the second half, the Springboks blew the match open, running the match to 64–0. The defeat is the fifth largest in USA Rugby history and the largest in a World Cup.\nSource: World Rugby\nRank is as of the end of the pool stages, and does not include the knockout rounds.\n2023 Rugby World Cup.\nDid not qualify.\nFinished second to Portugal in the cross-regional playoff."

        "text": "The 1983–84 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team represented University of North Carolina in the 1983–84 NCAA Division I men's basketball season as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. They finished the season 28–3 overall, won the ACC regular season title with a 14–0 record and made it to the Sweet Sixteen of the 1984 NCAA tournament. They were coached by Dean Smith in his twenty-third season as head coach of the Tar Heels. They played their home games at the Carmichael Auditorium in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.\nSeason Summary.\nReturning seniors Sam Perkins and Matt Doherty, junior Michael Jordan, and sophomore Brad Daugherty, the Tar Heels were ranked #1 in the AP poll and #2 in the Coaches' Poll to start the season.\nOn Saturday, November 3 coach Dean Smith recorded his 500th career victory with an 88–75 win at Stanford. On Wednesday, January 25 UNC recorded its largest margin of victory in the history of its rivalry with Wake Forest, trouncing Wake Forest 100–63. Except for the second week of the season, North Carolina was ranked #1 in the AP Poll for the entire season. The Tar Heels were 16–0 and dominating other teams, when their point guard, freshman Kenny Smith, was injured. He broke his wrist after being taken down on a break-away against #10 LSU on January 29, 1984. Although North Carolina won the game 90–79, the team's chemistry was disrupted. The Tar Heels won their next four games to reach 21–0 but lost on February 12, 1984, at 19th ranked (UPI) Arkansas 65–64. They won their last five games, including a memorable season-ending game over Duke (see below), to finish the regular season 26–1 and 14–0 in the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nAlthough Kenny Smith returned with a cast on his arm against Duke, the Tar Heels' season ended on a flat note. After beating Clemson in the opening round of the ACC Tournament, North Carolina lost to Duke 77–75 (see below) in the semi-finals of the tournament. Despite the loss, the Tar Heels retained their #1 ranking and received a #1 seed in the East Regional of the NCAA tournament. They received a first-round bye and defeated #8-seed Temple 77–66 in the second round. However, their season ended in disappointment in the East Regional semi-finals with a 72–68 loss to #4-seed Indiana.\nDean Smith often said that the 1983–84 Tar Heels' team was one of the few teams he coached that he felt was the best team in the country. Although freshman Kenny Smith was overshadowed by other teammates on this team, his mid-season injury may have prevented the Tar Heels, and stars Michael Jordan and Sam Perkins, from winning their second national championship in three years.\nNorth Carolina played two notable games against Duke in 1984:\nThe final home game for Matt Doherty, Michael Jordan, and Sam Perkins, was a memorable one for Tar Heels fans. North Carolina looked to be finished when Duke's Mark Alarie converted a three-point play with 20 second to go in regulation and the Tar Heels missed a jumper that would have tied the game. However, after the Blue Devils missed the front end of a one-and-one, Matt Doherty took the inbounds pass the length of the court and hit a 15-footer with one second remaining to force overtime. The teams traded baskets during the first overtime and headed for the second extra session tied at 79. Michael Jordan opened the second overtime with an ally oop and a free throw, but Johnny Dawkins cut the North Carolina lead to 82–81 with a short jumper. Duke would get only one more basket as Jordan and Sam Perkins carried the Tar Heels to the 96–83 final, and North Carolina became the first ACC team in 10 years to go undefeated in conference play (14–0). Alarie led all scorers with 28 points, while Jordan topped Carolina with 25.\nAfter losing two close games to North Carolina in the regular season, Duke finally upset the Tar Heels in the semifinals of the ACC Tournament. Johnny Dawkins and Tommy Amaker led the Blue Devils to a 40–32 halftime advantage. Nevertheless, North Carolina went on a 12–2 run to open the second half, tying the score at 44–44 in a game that was close the rest of the way. David Henderson hit four late free throws to keep Duke in the lead, but Michael Jordan closed the gap to 77–75. North Carolina regained possession with three seconds left in the game, but the Tar Heels comeback bid ended with Matt Doherty's errant inbounds pass. Jordan led all scorers with 22 points, while Doherty scored 20 and grabbed 10 rebounds.\nRoster.\nSource: Tar Heel Times\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| ACC Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=| NCAA Tournament"

        "title": "1981–82 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1981–82 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 1981–82 NCAA Division I college basketball season. Led by tenth-year head coach John Thompson, it was the first season in which they played their home games at the Capital Centre in suburban Landover, Maryland, except for five games at McDonough Gymnasium on campus in Washington, D.C.\nThey were members of the Big East Conference and finished the season with a record of 30-7 overall, 10–4 in Big East play. They won the Big East tournament championship, and in the 48-team NCAA tournament they advanced to the national championship game, but lost to North Carolina.\nSeason recap.\nThis season saw the arrival of freshman Patrick Ewing as Georgetowns center. Rumors arose even before his arrival that he lacked the academic ability to perform at Georgetown and some sportswriters opined that Georgetown was compromising its academic standards in order to recruit a star player like Ewing. John Thompson and other school officials dismissed the rumors and criticism, and Thompson went to great lengths to shield Ewing from the media. Ewing would go on to earn his degree from Georgetown on time in May 1985.\nGeorgetowns move from on-campus McDonough Gymnasium to the Capital Centre for its home games had been prompted by a surge in fan interest in the team as its prominence grew, especially after Ewings arrival sparked great excitement; average attendance at Georgetown games was twice that of the previous season. The Hoyas started the season 11–2 against non-conference opponents, with senior guard and team co-captain Eric \"Sleepy\" Floyd getting off to an uncharacteristically slow start but then returning to his role as the teams leading scorer, with a combined 41 points in games against American and George Washington, 27 against Nevada-Las Vegas, and 14 of Georgetowns 38 points in a pre-shot-clock-era slow-down game against Columbia.\nEwing did not start Georgetowns first game of the season, but he did start the second one and every game after that for the rest of his collegiate career. His talent became apparent immediately to observers following the team closely, but the national media knew him only as one of the years promising young centers. His breakout game came on January 6, 1982, when he played in New York City for the first time. Madison Square Garden hosted its first major college basketball doubleheader since the mid-1960s that day, with No. 9 Wichita State facing Iona in the first game followed by No. 13 Georgetown taking on No. 20 St. John's in the Hoyas Big East opener. Many expected St. Johns to win, but Ewing put in a dominating performance and during the first half Georgetown jumped out to a 41–9 lead. The Hoyas led by 24 points at the half and won 72–42, stunning St. John's fans and ending the medias comparisons of Ewing to any other center in the country. Floyd, meanwhile, led the team in scoring, as he would in nine of the first 11 Big East games of the season and in 11 Big East games overall during the year.\nOn February 20, 1982, No. 13 Georgetown hosted No. 4 Missouri, led by center Steve Stipanovich, in a nationally televised game held at McDonough Gymnasium – the last major men's basketball game scheduled there – because of a scheduling conflict at the Capital Centre. The announced crowd of 4,620 was a record for McDonough, and observers believed the crowd actually exceeded 5,000. Floyd scored 16 points and the issue was never really in doubt, with Georgetown upsetting the Tigers 63–51. The enduring image of the game, shown three times to the television audience on instant replay, was a play in which Ewing attempted to take an alley-oop pass in for a dunk; he missed the dunk, but slammed the ball onto the rim so hard that it flew 20 to 30 feet (6 to 9 meters) into the air, drawing a huge crowd reaction and prompting television commentators to express admiration for his power and potential.\nSenior center Ed Spriggs started the first game of the year but did not start again, instead coming off the bench to relieve Ewing, especially during the middle of games when Ewing had to come out of play with foul trouble. Spriggs greatest success came in mid-season with a 14-point, seven-rebound effort against Syracuse.\nSophomore Fred Brown started all 37 games and played point guard all season. He shot 50% from the field, had 131 assists, and set a single-season school record with 80 steals. Senior guard-forward Eric Smith shot 47.9% from the field, averaging 9.5 points per game, and had 75 steals and 116 assists. Early in the year, he scored 17 points against Villanova, and he had 11 points in the Missouri game.\nSenior forward Mike Hancock started all 37 games. Although overshadowed by Ewing by the end of the season, he shot 47% from the field and had a career-high 20 points, along with seven rebounds, against Boston College. Freshman forward Bill Martin spent most of the season as a reserve behind Hancock, but he did score 21 points early in the season against Saint Leo. Sophomore guard Gene Smith had proven himself to be a top defensive asset for the Hoyas the previous season, but he was injured during most of this year. He scored a season-high 10 points against Syracuse, but otherwise scored only 19 points in the other 20 games in which he played.\nSleepy Floyd scored 29 points – his season high – against Villanova and 20 and 27 points in two games against Syracuse, and the Hoyas finished second in the Big East regular season behind Villanova. During the 1982 Big East men's basketball tournament, Floyd averaged 16.3 points per game, and Georgetown defeated Villanova in the final for the second Big East tournament championship in Georgetown men's basketball history. Eric Smith, who had only four points in the semifinal against St. John's, helped lead Georgetown to victory in the Villanova game with 14 points.\nThe Hoyas received a No. 1 seed and first-round bye in the West Region of the 1982 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, the fourth of 14 consecutive Georgetown NCAA tournament appearances. Against Wyoming in the second round, Eric Smith scored 13 points and held Wyomings Bill Garnett to just five as Georgetown won 51–43. Meeting No. 4 Oregon State in the West Region final, Georgetown shot 29-for-39 (74.4%) from the field – a school record and the third-best ever in an NCAA Tournament game – and Floyd scored 22 points on the way to a 69–45 win that put Georgetown in the Final Four for only the second time in its history and the first time since 1943. In a defensive struggle in the national semifinals against Louisville, Georgetown sophomore guard Fred Brown played one of the best games of his career, Floyd continued his hot scoring, and Eric Smith scored 14 points to give the Hoyas a 50–46 win and their second appearance in the NCAA final and first since 1943.\nThe Hoyas played North Carolina in the final before 61,612 fans, the largest paid basketball crowd in NCAA history. Between the two teams, ten future professionals, among them five future National Basketball Association (NBA) All-Stars, played in a tight game in which neither team ever led by more than four points. Eric Smith scored 14 points and had five assists. Floyd ran his combined point total in the Louisville and North Carolina games to 31, making him the top scorer across both games, while Ewing went 10-for-15 from the field, scored 23 points, had 11 rebounds and three steals, and blocked two shots. With 18 seconds left in the game, North Carolina freshman Michael Jordan scored on an 18-foot (5.5-meter) shot to give the Tar Heels a one-point lead. As Georgetown set its offense for a final shot with seconds left, Brown mistook North Carolina forward James Worthy for Eric Smith and passed the ball to Worthy; as Worthy dribbled down the court, Eric Smith had to foul him to stop the clock with two seconds left. At the free-throw line, Worthy missed the first shot of a one-and-one; Georgetown got the rebound and passed it to Floyd, who made the last shot of his collegiate career, a desperate heave from halfcourt with one second left that fell several feet short. North Carolina took the national championship 63–62, and Georgetowns season ended with cameras capturing John Thompson on the sidelines consoling a devastated Fred Brown with a hug while the Tar Heels celebrated.\nFloyd was among five seniors on the team to graduate in 1982, having been the Hoyas top scorer in all four of his seasons with the team; he remains the top-scoring player in Georgetown history. Drafted in the first round in 1982 by the New Jersey Nets, he had a very successful NBA career, playing for the Nets, Golden State Warriors, and Houston Rockets before retiring in 1995.\nThe 1981–82 Hoyas were ranked No. 6 in the season's final Associated Press Poll and No. 7 in the final Coaches' Poll.\nRoster.\nFreshman center Patrick Ewing later returned to Georgetown as head coach in 2017.\nSource\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA Tournament"

        "text": "The 1983–84 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 1983–84 NCAA Division I college basketball season. John Thompson coached them in his 12th season as head coach. They played their home games at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland, except for one game played at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. The team was a member of the Big East Conference and finished the season with a record of 34–3 overall, 14–2 in Big East play. They won both the Big East regular-season championship, the 1984 Big East tournament championship, and they defeated Houston in the 1984 NCAA tournament final to win the only national championship in Georgetown history.\nSeason recap.\nThe team had a tremendous run during the regular season, losing only three games – by only two points each to DePaul and Villanova and by only four points to St. John's in a game in which St. Johns junior guard Chris Mullin scored 33 points. Georgetowns junior center Patrick Ewing shot 60 percent from the field; averaged 16 points (despite only shooting the ball eight to 10 times in most games), 10 rebounds, and 3.6 blocked shots per game; led the Hoyas in scoring in 23 games, including 14 of the last 17 games; and scored 20 or more points ten times, including 20 against Pittsburgh, 23 (and 15 rebounds) against Connecticut, 23 against Providence, and 25 against Boston College.\nFreshman forward Reggie Williams joined the team this season. Destined to become one of the greatest players in Georgetown history, Williams started only nine games, but he appeared in all 37 games and usually played 15 to 20 minutes, generally scoring eight to 10 points; he averaged 9.1 points per game overall and 8.4 points per game in Big East play. His season high was 22 points against Syracuse.\nSophomore guard-forward David Wingate played more at guard this season than he had the previous year. Among the top defenders in the Big East, he also was a strong offensive force for the Hoyas. During the two games of the Las Vegas Classic in late December 1983 – the second of which, on December 30, 1983, saw the first sell-out in the history of the new Thomas &amp; Mack Center and was broadcast on national television by CBS – he scored a combined 45 points, shot 21-for-21 from the free-throw line, and was selected as the tournaments Most Valuable Player. He played in all 37 games and consistently scored nine to 12 points, leading the team in scoring in three games. He finished the season averaging 11.2 points per game, leading the team in steals, and second in assists.\nSophomore guard Michael Jackson missed the first five games of the season with a shoulder injury and did not start games consistently until January 1984, but he started 22 of the 31 games in which he played. He shot 56 percent from the field and averaged 10.5 points per game, and his 137 steals led the team.\nJunior forward Bill Martin started the first six games of the season before moving to the bench in early December 1983 to play a role as a key reserve for the remainder of the season. Off the bench, he averaged 27 minutes per game in Georgetowns 16 Big East regular season games and had four double-doubles in conference play. In the two games against Boston College he had a combined 32 points and 20 rebounds, and in the two against Connecticut he scored a combined 22 points and had 17 rebounds. His best game, however, was a nationally televised mid-February 1984 non-conference contest against Brigham Young, in which he shot 8-for-8 from the field, had 23 points and 15 rebounds, and on defense held Cougars forward Devin Durrant, who was averaging 27.9 points per game, to 5-for-16 (31.3%) shooting from the field. Martin finished the year averaging 8.9 points per game.\nSenior guard and team captain Gene Smith, a defensive specialist, saw limited playing time, but averaged 22 minutes a game and led the team in steals. In Big East play he shot 59% from the field.\nThe Hoyas were the Big East regular-season champions, finishing with a 14–2 record. They received a bye in the first round of the 1984 Big East men's basketball tournament and defeated Providence in the quarterfinals. They beat St. John's in the semifinals, with Ewing shooting 11-for-12 (91.7%) from the field and Williams scoring 17 points. They met arch-rival Syracuse in the final, in which Syracuses Dwayne \"Pearl\" Washington scored 27 points, while Ewing also scored 27 and pulled down 16 rebounds. With Syracuse in the lead and Ewing sitting on the bench with four fouls, Georgetown freshman forward Michael Graham entered the game to contain Syracuses Andre Hawkins, drawing national attention with his defensive effort. At one point, with Graham and Hawkins fighting for a rebound under the basket, Graham appeared to take a swing at Hawkins and an official immediately called a technical foul and ejected him from the game; after the officials conferred with one another, however, they changed the call to a personal foul, allowing Graham to stay in the game and incensing Syracuse fans. With Michael Jackson scoring critical late-game free throws – part of a 20-point performance, including 8-for-8 from the free-throw line – Georgetown came back to tie the game and force overtime, during which the Hoyas pulled away to an 81–72 win and the Big East tournament championship for the third time in the program's history, with Ewing averaging 23 points a game during the tournament. In the post-game press conference, Syracuses head coach Jim Boeheim overturned a chair in anger and declared \"The best team did not win tonight!\"\nSeeded No. 1 in the West Region of the 1984 NCAA tournament – the sixth of 14 consecutive Georgetown NCAA tournament appearances – the Hoyas received a first-round bye. They had a scare in the second round, narrowly missing being upset in a pre-shot-clock-era slowdown game against a Southern Methodist team led by center Jon Koncak. SMU led 24–16 at halftime. In the second half, Georgetown came back to lead 32–26 with eight minutes left, but SMU managed to tie the game at 34–34 with 2:46 to go. With 51 seconds left, SMU fouled Gene Smith, who missed the first shot of a one-and-one, but Ewing tipped the ball in for a basket and a 36–34 lead. After SMUs Johnny Fuller missed a shot, SMU was forced to foul Michael Jackson to stop the clock, and Jackson scored on one of his two free throws to give Georgetown a 37–34 lead. No three-point shot yet existed in the tournament, so the Mustangs raced down the court and scored to narrow the lead to 37–36, but then time expired. After the game, fans and sportswriters noted that had Smith made his free throws, SMU could have tied the game to put it into overtime, and had Ewing not tipped in Smith's miss, the Mustangs could have won the game with their basket on the final play.\nGeorgetown continued to advance, reaching the Final Four for the third time in school history and second time in three years to face Kentucky, a team which had never lost a national semifinal game and was led by the \"Twin Towers,\" Sam Bowie and Melvin Turpin. Bowie and Turpin managed to get Ewing into foul trouble early, and with him on the bench and Reggie Williams shooting only 1-for-7 (14.3%) from the field during the game, the Wildcats raced out to a 27–15 lead with 3:06 left in the first half. After that however, the Hoyas made a defensive stand still unequalled in college basketball: Kentucky scored only two more points in the first half; the Wildcats also did not score in the first 9 minutes 55 seconds of the second half, missing their first 12 shots and after that shooting 3-for-21 (14.3%) during the remainder of the game. Overall, Kentucky shot 3-for-33 (9.1 percent) from the field during the second half. Although he played for only 17 minutes and suffered a season-ending foot injury in the second half, Gene Smith had one of the best defensive games of his career. Bowie and Turpin finished the game a combined 0-for-12, Wingate scored 12 points and held Kentuckys Jim Master to 2-for-7 (28.6%) shooting from the field, Michael Jackson scored 12 points and pulled down a career-high 10 rebounds, and Georgetown won 53–40 to advance to the national final for the third time in school history and second time in three years.\nIn the NCAA final, Georgetown faced Houston on April 2, 1984. Reggie Williams demonstrated his true potential for the first time, putting in a strong defensive performance and shooting 9-for-18 (50.0%) from the field with 19 points and seven rebounds in the game, while Wingate scored 16 points and Ewing managed 10 points and nine rebounds. Jackson scored 11 points and had six assists, two of which set up Ewing and Graham for decisive baskets late in the game. The game was decided well before the final whistle, and the Hoyas won the schools first national championship 84–75. Late in the game, with Georgetown enjoying a comfortable lead, Thompson began to pull starters out and give bench players some time on the court; the game's enduring image came when senior guard Fred Brown came out of the game. Two years earlier, Brown had mistakenly passed the ball to North Carolinas James Worthy in the last seconds of the 1982 championship game, ruining Georgetowns chances for a final game-winning shot and allowing North Carolina to take the national championship, and cameras had captured Thompson consoling a devastated Brown with a hug as the Tar Heels celebrated. As Brown left the 1984 championship game, cameras caught Brown and Thompson again embracing on the sideline, this time to celebrate a victory.\nThe 1983-84 Hoyas were ranked No. 2 in the seasons final Associated Press Poll and Coaches' Poll and won what was then a school-record 34 games. They remain the only Georgetown men's basketball team to win a national championship.\nRoster.\nJunior center Patrick Ewing later returned to Georgetown as head coach in 2017.\nSource\nRankings.\nSource\n1983–84 Schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA Tournament"

        "text": "The 1984–85 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 1984–85 NCAA Division I college basketball season. John Thompson, coached them in his 13th season as head coach. They played their home games at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland. They were members of the Big East Conference and finished the season with a record of 35-3, 14-2 in Big East play. They won the 1985 Big East men's basketball tournament and advanced to the final of the 1985 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, which they lost to Big East rival Villanova in what is widely regarded as one of the greatest upsets in college basketball history. They were ranked No. 1 in the seasons final Associated Press Poll and Coaches' Poll.\nSeason recap.\nSophomore forward Michael Graham had angered Thompson with his inattention to final examinations at the end of the previous academic year, and Thompson left him off the team this year; he stayed out of basketball this season and waited for Thompson to return him to the team until the fall of 1985, when he transferred to the University of the District of Columbia to resume his basketball career. However, freshman guard Perry McDonald joined the team this season, and he was destined to become one of Georgetowns great players. Although he did not start this season, he played in all 38 games off the bench, averaging 4.1 points per game. Most of his minutes came early in the season, and he had a season-high 15 points against Tennessee State.\nSophomore forward Reggie Williams missed the first three games of the season with an injury and played off the bench in the fourth game, but he became a starter in the fifth game and remained one for the next 100 games of his collegiate career. During the season, he shot 50.6% from the field, led the team in scoring eight times, and averaged 11.9 points per game. Sophomore guard-forward David Wingate shot over 50% from the field during Big East play and scored the 1,000th point of his collegiate career halfway through the season. He averaged 12.4 points and 6.6 rebounds per game for the year. Junior guard Michael Jackson, meanwhile, averaged 7.3 points per game, but made his greatest contribution to the Hoyas offense with 242 assists, far and away a new school record. During the six NCAA Tournament games Georgetown played this season, Jackson averaged nine assists per game.\nAfter spending most of the previous season playing off the bench, senior forward Bill Martin returned to the starting lineup. He led the team in scoring in eight games, shot 54% from the field, and was second on the team in rebounding for the third straight year. Junior guard Horace Broadnax completed his third season in a valuable reserve role, averaging 5.2 points per game; by the end of the season he had scored in double figures 18 times in his three years at Georgetown and was averaging 5.3 points per game for his career.\nEntering its game with No. 3 St. John's at the Capital Centre on January 26, 1985, No. 1 Georgetown had a 29-game winning streak that dated back to the previous season, when St. Johns had defeated Georgetown at the Capital Centre on February 21, 1984. In the January 26, 1985, game, St. John's again beat Georgetown, with St. John's head coach Lou Carnesecca attired in an old sweater he had worn in five straight St. John's wins to combat the effects of a common cold, and his team was elevated to No. 1 in the next AP Poll. The New York City media dubbed it Carneseccas lucky sweater, and Carnesecca wore it in every game after that as St. John's won another ten games in a row. When Georgetown and St. John's next met on February 26, 1985, in a game at Madison Square Garden nationally televised by ESPN, St. John's was ranked No. 1, Georgetown was ranked No. 2, and the rivalry between the two schools was at its peak. When Carnesecca – wearing his sweater – and Thompson met courtside for a pregame handshake, Thompson opened his coat to reveal that he was wearing a replica T-shirt of Carneseccas sweater, drawing a roar of laughter from the crowd. Reggie Williams scored a season-high 25 points, and Georgetown went on to defeat St. Johns in what went down in Georgetown and St. Johns history as \"The Sweater Game.\"\nOther than the one-point loss to St. John's on January 26 and a two-point loss to Syracuse two days later, Georgetown won every game during the regular season, dominating many of its opponents. Senior center Patrick Ewing averaged fewer than 10 shots per game for the season, but nonetheless scored in double figures in 12 of the 16 regular-season Big East games. He also averaged 14.6 points and 9.2 rebounds per game for the year.\nThe Hoyas won the 1985 Big East men's basketball tournament, their second straight Big East tournament championship and the fourth in Georgetown men's basketball history, defeating Connecticut in the quarterfinal, No. 13 Syracuse in the semifinal, and No. 2 St. Johns in the final. Bill Martin averaged 17 points and seven rebounds per game during the tournament.\nRanked No. 1 in the country, the Hoyas were the No. 1 seed in the East Region of the 1985 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament – the seventh of 14 consecutive Georgetown NCAA tournament appearances. They advanced to the Final Four for the third time in four years – defeating No. 14 Loyola of Chicago and No. 6 Georgia Tech along the way – and met St. Johns in the national semifinal. Both teams had been ranked No. 1 or No. 2 for most of the season, and St. Johns had a 4-4 record against the Hoyas over the preceding three years, a record unequaled by Georgetowns other opponents during the same period. St. Johns biggest scoring threat was senior guard Chris Mullin, who had averaged 25.8 points per game in his last eight games against Georgetown and had not scored fewer than 20 points in any of those games. Wingate held Mullin to 4-for-8 shooting from the field and eight points, Mullins lowest scoring performance against the Hoyas since his freshman year. Reggie Williams scored 20 points in the game as Georgetown won to advance to the national championship game for the third time in four years.\nGeorgetown was the heavy favorite to defeat Big East rival Villanova and win a second-straight national championship. Exceeding expectations, Villanova had had a storybook tournament, advancing from a No. 8 seed in the Southeast Region and upsetting Michigan, Maryland, and North Carolina to reach the championship game. Wingate had a team-high 16 points in the game and Reggie Williams scored 10 but turned his ankle late in the first half, an injury which slowed him for the rest of the game. Overall Georgetown shot 29-for-53 (55%) from the field, which might have been good enough to win most games. Villanova, however, set an NCAA record that still stands for team shooting percentage from the field in a single game, shooting 22-for-28 (78.6%) from the field as well as 22-for-27 (81.5%) from the free-throw line; after halftime, the Wildcats shot 90% from the field, missing only one field goal attempt in the entire second half. The record-breaking performance earned Villanova a two-point victory, defeating the Hoyas 66-64 in what many observers regard as perhaps the biggest upset in American sports history.\nAlthough denied a second-straight national championship, Georgetown was ranked No. 1 in the seasons final Associated Press Poll and Coaches' Poll, Georgetowns only No. 1 ranking at the end of a season in either poll. The 1984-85 teams 35 wins was a new school record, breaking the previous record of 34 set by the national championship team of the previous year.\nEwing, who sportswriters and opposing fans had often accused of lacking the intellect to perform academically at Georgetown, graduated on time in May 1985. Generally considered the greatest player in Georgetown men's basketball history, he finished his four-year collegiate career with many school records, including highest career field goal percentage (.620), all-time leading rebounder (1,316), all-time leading shot blocker (493), second leading scorer (2,184), fifth in steals (167), and most games played in a career (143). During his four years with the team, the Hoyas had won one Big East regular season championship, won three Big East tournament titles, played in four NCAA tournaments, made three Final Four appearances, played in three national championship games, and won one national championship. During the nine years of John Thompson, Jr.s tenure as head coach before Ewings arrival, the Hoyas had won two NCAA tournament games; during Ewings four years, they won 15. Georgetown had an overall record of 121-23 during the Ewing years, winning fewer than 30 games in a season only once and never winning fewer than 22. After a long career as a player and coach in the National Basketball Association, he would return to Georgetown as head coach in 2017.\nThe 1984-85 season saw Georgetowns last Final Four appearance until the 2006-07 season. The Hoyas have not returned to the national championship game.\nRoster.\nSenior center Patrick Ewing later returned to Georgetown as head coach in 2017.\nSource\nRankings.\nSource\n1984–85 schedule and results.\nSources\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA Tournament"

        "text": "The 1991–92 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team represented the University of Kentucky in NCAA competition in the 1991–92 season. The team was coached by Rick Pitino.\nThis season's team is one of the most fondly remembered in UK's long basketball history. Due to major recruiting violations committed by Pitino's predecessor Eddie Sutton, the 1991–92 Wildcats were coming off a three-year postseason ban where the team was not allowed to compete in tournament play. (Note the NCAA did not find Sutton personally liable.) The violations had mainly centered on alleged cheating by 1987-89 player Eric Manuel on the ACT college entrance exam and cash payments to the guardian of another former player, Chris Mills.\nThe 1991–92 season was the first year after probation when the Wildcats were allowed to compete and the only opportunity for the team's four seniors, who remained loyal to the program as opposed to transferring to teams allowed in the tournament. Three of these seniors were Kentucky natives. Together, all four would enter Kentucky basketball history as \"The Unforgettables\":\nAlthough the seniors were the heart and soul of the team, its biggest star was sophomore Jamal Mashburn, who would go on to become a consensus first-team All-American the following season and have a successful 12-year NBA career; he is now an NBA analyst for ESPN.\nThe Wildcats' run in the NCAA tournament would end in a regional final against Duke that is often cited as the greatest college game ever played. The heavily favored Blue Devils survived an overtime thriller on Christian Laettner's last-second shot at the buzzer.\nTeam legacy.\nThe legacy of \"The Unforgettables\" was so great within the university that the UK program decided to retire the players' jerseys (but not their numbers) almost immediately after their final tournament game. (While jersey retirement is not uncommon, it is rare for a school to bestow this honor so soon after a player's career ends.) The team also went on a post-tournament all-county exhibition tour, where thousands of Kentuckians gathered in high school gyms across the commonwealth to meet and express pride in the team.\nNational and local sports news outlets continued to cover the players in \"where are they now\" and similar features for at least 25 years after the tournament. In 2005, a documentary film about the team, \"Beyond the Glory,\" was released.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=| SEC Tournament\n!colspan=9 style=| NCAA Tournament\nTeam players drafted into the NBA.\nJamal Mashburn of the Wildcats was claimed in the 1992 NBA draft."

The team played its home games in the Crisler Arena in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and was a member of the Big Ten Conference. Under the direction of head coach Steve Fisher, the team finished tied for third in the Big Ten Conference. The team earned an invitation to the 1992 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament where it was national runner up. Although the team compiled a 25–9 record during the season, the National Collegiate Athletic Association has adjusted the team's record to 24–8 due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal. The team was ranked for the entire eighteen weeks of Associated Press Top Twenty-Five Poll, starting the season ranked twentieth, rising as high as number eleven and ending ranked fifteenth, and it ended the season ranked seventeenth in the final USA Today/CNN Poll. The team had a 6–6 record against ranked opponents, including the following victories: January 9, 1992, against the number sixteen ranked Iowa Hawkeyes 80–77 (overtime) at Carver–Hawkeye Arena in Iowa City, Iowa, January 29 against the number thirteen ranked Michigan State Spartans 89–79 (overtime) at the Breslin Student Events Center in East Lansing, Michigan, March 8 against the number two ranked Indiana Hoosiers 68–60 at Crisler Arena, March 27 the number eleven ranked 75–72 in the 1992 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament at Rupp Arena, March 29 the number three ranked Ohio State Buckeyes 75–71 at Rupp Arena in Lexington, Kentucky, and April 4 against the number twelve ranked Cincinnati Bearcats 76–72 at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis.\nThe team had rotating captains on a game-by-game basis, and Chris Webber earned team MVP. The team's leading scorers were Jalen Rose (597 points), Chris Webber (528 points), and Juwan Howard (377 points). The leading rebounders were Webber (340), Howard (212), and Rose (146).\nDuring the season, the team won the Big Ten Conference statistical championships in rebounding and rebounding margin with at 38.2 average and 5.8 average margin in conference games, respectively. Chris Webber became the first freshman to lead the Big Ten in rebounds with a 9.8 average in 18 conference games and 10.0 average in 34 overall games. However, his 340 rebounds in 34 games fell short of Phil Hubbard's school freshman single-season record of 352 rebounds set as a member of the 1975–76 team that still stands as the school record .\nJalen Rose set the current school record for points scored by a freshman 597. Rose also set the school single-season record for minutes played with 1132 minutes. The following season, four players surpassed this total.\nThe team set the school record for single-season team blocks with 182 in 34 games, surpassing the 1986 teams total of 146 in 33 games. The following season the team would rebreak the record.\nThe Wolverines 25–9 record was an improvement on the previous year's record of 14–15. Due to the success of the Fab Five, athletic royalties increased from 2 million dollars in 1990 ($ million today) to 4.4 million dollars ($ million) in 1992.\nThe team, coached by Steve Fisher, is best remembered for the entry of a remarkably talented freshman class, known as the Fab Five, that would become the starting lineup:\nReserve point guard Rob Pelinka would go on to greater fame as an agent for numerous NBA stars, most notably Kobe Bryant, and as General Manager for the Los Angeles Lakers.\nAlthough the Wolverines would make the NCAA title game that season, losing to defending national champion Duke, they vacated their Final Four appearance in the wake of a major scandal involving many years of improper payments from a major booster to several former players, among them Webber.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| Big Ten Conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| NCAA tournament\nRegular season.\nAs Michigan celebrated Midnight Madness on October 15, 1991, there was already talk that at least four of the five freshmen would be starting before the season ended. (The five eventually started in a combined 304 of a possible 350 man-games among them during their first two seasons.) In the Elite Eight round of the 1992 NCAA Men's Division I basketball tournament, Michigan earned a rematch against a Jimmy Jackson-led Ohio State Buckeyes team that had beaten them twice during the regular season by double digits. Michigan won the rematch, during which the Fab Five scored all but two Wolverines points. When the 24–8 Wolverines reached the Final Four round of the tournament, they found themselves matched against a 29–4 Bob Huggins-coached Cincinnati Bearcats team that averaged 83.6 points per game and had lost to only three teams, two of which had beaten Michigan. Nick Van Exel, who became the starter in the middle of the season, led Cincinnati in postseason scoring. Howard, King and Riley shaved their heads for the game. Michigan won and earned a rematch with the Duke Blue Devils team that had beaten them by three points in overtime in December. Duke scored in its final 12 possessions of the championship game, going on a 23–6 run to win by a final margin of 71–51.\nStatistics.\nThe team posted the following statistics:\nNCAA tournament.\nOn March 20 as the number six seed in the first round of the southeast region of the 1992 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in Atlanta at the Omni Coliseum, the team defeated number eleven seed Temple 73–66. On March 22, the team defeated number fourteen seed East Tennessee State 102–90 in Atlanta. Then in the sweet sixteen, in Lexington, Kentucky, at Rupp Arena on March 27, the team defeated number two seeded 75–72. On March 29 in the elite eight round in Lexington, the team defeated number one seed Ohio State 75–71 in overtime. In the national semifinal round of the final four on April 4 in Minneapolis at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, the team defeated number four seed Cincinnati 76–72. However, in the championship game at the Metrodome on April 6, the team lost to number one seed Duke 71–51.\nThe team established the NCAA record for fewest single-game three-point field goals made in a final four (1 vs. Duke on April 6, 1992), a record the team would surpass the following year. It also established the record for lowest single-game three-point field goal percentage with a 1-for-11 performance (9.1%) that stood until 2006. Although these final four records have been surpassed, both of these marks continue to stand as NCAA records for the championship game.\nTeam players drafted into the NBA.\nFive players from this team were selected in the NBA draft."

In common with many other sports rugby union has an array of competitions, both domestic international, covering the spectrum of competition structures from season long leagues, to one-off matches. The list below is divided into sections such that trophies and awards competed for by national sides are grouped together, as are those competed for by club and provincial sides. In both cases, the type of award can differ. The award might be a perpetual trophy, which is one competed for in perpetuity by two sides such that on each occasion they meet, which may or may not be on a regular basis, that honour is contested. The award may be one that is given to the winner of a tournament, or as a subset of this, as an award for a particular honour attained in that tournament. Additionally, the sport of rugby union bestows certain honours on individual players, and these too have their own dedicated section below."

        "text": "Charles William Harrison (April 25, 1941 – December 30, 2023) was an American professional baseball player. He was a first baseman in Major League Baseball who played between through for the Houston Astros (1965–1967) and Kansas City Royals (1969, 1971). Listed at , , Harrison batted and threw right-handed. He was signed by the Houston Colt .45s (the Astros' original nickname) in 1963 out of the Texas Tech University.\nA native of Abilene, Texas, he attended Abilene High School. Harrison was 24 years old when he entered the majors with the Astros in . He was a good athlete with an excellent glove work, who unfortunately lacked the prototypical power for a first baseman. His most productive season came in 1966, when he posted career numbers in games (119), batting average (.256), runs (52), RBI (52), hits (111) and extra-base hits (34), including three four-hit games. But in 1967 Harrison became expendable with the emergence of Doug Rader at first base. (Rader actually became an excellent \"third\" baseman.) At the end of the season, he was sent by Houston along Sonny Jackson to the Atlanta Braves in the same transaction that brought Denny Lemaster and Denis Menke to the Astros. A year later, he was purchased by the Royals from Atlanta.\nIn a five-season career, Harrison was a .238 hitter (241-for-1012) with 17 home runs and 126 RBI in 328 games, including 94 runs, 43 doubles, six triples, and three stolen bases. At first base, he committed just 22 errors in 2464 chances for a .991 fielding percentage.\nHarrison died on December 30, 2023, at the age of 82."

        "title": "Cricket in the Netherlands",
        "text": "Cricket has been played in the Netherlands since at least the 19th century, and in the 1860s was considered a major sport in the country. The sport is governed by the Royal Dutch Cricket Association.\nOther sports (notably football) have long since surpassed cricket in popularity amongst the Dutch but today there are around 6,500 cricketers in the Netherlands and recent developments show that cricket is growing in Netherlands. The first national association, the forerunner of today's KNCB, was formed in 1883, and the Netherlands achieved associate membership of the ICC in 1966.\nThe Dutch national side has qualified for the World Cup on five\noccasions (1996, 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2023) and the ICC World Twenty20 on five occasions (2009, 2014, 2016, 2019 and 2022). The team previously had One Day International (ODI) status, but lost that status at the 2014 World Cup Qualifier, at which it failed to qualify for the 2015 World Cup. They regained the One Day International (ODI) status after clinching the ICC World Cricket League Championship title in 2017.\nThe popularity of cricket in the Netherlands has also influenced the sport's development in both former Dutch colonies and current members of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Cricket in Indonesia was introduced by the Dutch, Sint Maarten is a member of the West Indies Cricket Board, and Suriname is an associate member of the ICC.\nHistory.\nThe popularity of cricket in the Netherlands has also influenced the sport's development in former Dutch colonies, including current members of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Suriname is an associate member of the ICC, and Sint Maarten is a member of the West Indies Cricket Board, which has full membership.\nIn 2005 the Dutch team beat the UAE to finish fifth in the ICC Trophy, a slightly disappointing result but one which qualified them for the 2007 World Cup; they enjoyed full One Day International status from 1 January 2006 until the 2009 ICC Trophy.\n2001 finally saw the Netherlands win the ICC Trophy, beating Namibia in the final in Toronto. They thus qualified for the 2003 World Cup. They again failed to progress beyond the first round in the tournament, but recorded their first one-day international win over Namibia during the tournament. Feiko Kloppenburg (with 121) and Klaas-Jan van Noortwijk (134 not out) scored the first two One Day International centuries in the side's history.\nIn the 2005 ICC Trophy, the Netherlands finished 5th, qualifying for the 2007 Cricket World Cup, and gaining one-day International status until the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier. Their first one-day international with this new status was scheduled to be against Kenya in March 2006; however this match was cancelled due to a Kenyan tour of Bangladesh. Instead their first ODI with this status (and their twelfth overall) came against Sri Lanka; this was their first ODI at home. Sri Lanka won the two-match series 2–0, scoring a record ODI score of 443–9 in one of the two matches.\nThe Dutch played their first Intercontinental Cup match of 2006 against Kenya in Nairobi in March. The game was drawn, but the Netherlands gained six points for a first innings lead. In August, the Netherlands competed in Division One of the European Championship. They beat Denmark and Italy, but lost to Scotland and their game against Ireland was rained off. They finished third in the tournament.\nIn November, the Dutch travelled to South Africa. They first played an Intercontinental Cup match against Bermuda: David Hemp achieved what was then a competition record score of 247 not out in the drawn match. This was followed by a triangular series against Bermuda and Canada, which they won. Their final game of 2006, also in South Africa, was an Intercontinental Cup game against Canada. They won the match by 7 wickets, with Ryan ten Doeschate setting a new competition record individual score of 259 not out.\nIn early 2007, they travelled to Nairobi, Kenya to take part in Division One of the World Cricket League, finishing third out of six. This was followed by the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies, where they were eliminated in the first round, though they did beat Scotland along the way.\nFollowing the World Cup, they underwent a period of transformation. Captain Luuk van Troost retired, as did Tim de Leede and their coach Peter Cantrell. Daan van Bunge also opted to take a break from international cricket, and the new coach opted not to retain the services of bowling coach Ian Pont.\nIn June 2007, they visited Canada, first winning an Intercontinental Cup match against Canada in King City, Ontario. They then won the first ODI by 117 runs, with the second one being abandoned. They then played a quadrangular series in Ireland, losing by ten wickets to the West Indies, and by one run to Ireland, with the game against Scotland being abandoned due to rain.\nIn August 2008, The Netherlands participated in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier. This was their debut playing Twenty20 International matches. They finished in first place in Group B, based on their run-rate. After beating Scotland in the Semi-Finals, the final was abandoned due to rain and the trophy was shared between The Netherlands and Ireland.\nThe Netherlands caused a sensation in the cricketing world by beating England in the opening match of the ICC World Twenty20 2009, whilst being 500/1 outsiders. They lost their second match to the eventual winners Pakistan and did not qualify for the super 8 stage based on run rate.\nIn July 2010, The Netherlands beat a full-member nation for the first time in an ODI. In a one-off match shortened by rain to 30 overs a side, they beat Bangladesh by 6 wickets. The win in combination with their winning percentage against other associate and affiliate nations resulted in The Netherlands being included in ICC's official ODI-rankings.\nIn February 2011, The Netherlands posted their highest ever total against a full-member nation, scoring 292 against England, batting first at the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Ryan Ten Doeschate top scored with 119 from 110 balls. However, the Netherlands were unable to defend their strong total and failed to pull off a huge shock, England winning by 6 wickets with 2 overs to spare. They eventually failed to win any of their group matches and were last in their Group.\nIn September 2011, Netherlands whitewashed Kenya in a short two-match ODI series held at home.\nIn January 2014, World Cup Qualifier saw Netherlands failed to qualify for the World Cup and lose their ODI status till 2018 although the Netherlands did qualify for 2014 ICC World Twenty20 instead of Scotland. It gained their ODI status back after winning the 2015–17 ICC World Cricket League Championship.\nIn the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, Netherlands had one win and one loss before their final game. In order to go through on net run rate against Zimbabwe and Ireland, they needed to chase down Ireland's score in 14.2 overs or less. As Ireland scored 189, this seemed unlikely.\nHowever, strong and aggressive batting enabled them to score 193/4 in 13.5 overs, securing passage to the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 Super 10s. Although they lost their first three games in the group, including a 39 all out against Sri Lanka, they pulled off an upset against England in their last game.\nGoverning body.\nThe Koninklijke Nederlandse Cricket Bond (Royal Dutch Cricket Board) is the governing body of cricket in the Netherlands. It was formed in 1883 and received a Royal charter in 1958. The Netherlands achieved Associate Membership of the ICC in 1966.\nThe KNCB has been an associate member of the International Cricket Council since 1966. There are a few cricket grounds in the Netherlands which are officially sanctioned by the ICC to host ODIs such as Amsterdam, Amstelveen and Voorburg. It hosted some of the matches of the 1999 Cricket World Cup, though the Dutch did not participate in that tournament.\nThe Dutch participated in the 1996 Cricket World Cup, 2003 Cricket World Cup, 2007 Cricket World Cup, and 2011 Cricket World Cup. In their debut campaign, they lost all of their matches badly barring a respectable performance against England. They qualified for the 2003 edition after winning the 2001 ICC Trophy, with their only win of the World Cup tournament coming against fellow qualifier Namibia. It was around this time that stars and excellent cricketers like Roland Lefebvre and Ryan ten Doeschate started emerging to make Dutch cricket much more strong.\nBefore 1958 it was known as the Nederlandse Cricket Bond or the Dutch Cricket Board. After receiving a Royal charter in 1958, a \"Royal\" was added before the board's name known simply as Koninklijke in Dutch. The following names have been for the board in their history:-\nDomestic competitions.\nThe main cricket division is called \"Topklasse\", in which eight teams compete for the national championships.\nOther important competitions are: \"Hoofdklasse\", Eerste Klasse, and the \"Twenty20 Cup\".\nTopklasse known before as Hoofdklasse is the highest domestic cricket competition in the Netherlands.\nEight teams are playing in the regular competition; the finalists being decided during a play-off stage.\nPrevious champions.\n1997 – Excelsior '20\n1998 – VRA\n1999 – VRA\n2000 – Excelsior '20\n2001 – VRA\n2002 – VCC\n2003 – VRA\n2004 – Excelsior '20\n2005 – VRA\n2006 – VRA\n2007 – VRA\n2008 – HCC\n2009 – Excelsior '20\n2010 – VRA\n2011 – VRA\n2012 – Excelsior '20\n2013 – Quick Haag\nTeams.\nA total of 8 teams are taking part in the league\nTwenty20 cricket.\nThe first season of the European T20 league, a Twenty20 franchise-based tournament, is scheduled to start in August 2019.\nGrounds.\nThere are numerous club grounds throughout Netherlands.

Some grounds have hosted Women's One Day Internationals and Women's Twenty20 Internationals.\nNational team.\nThe Netherlands national cricket team qualified for the Cricket World Cup on 4 occasions; 1996, 2003, 2007 and 2011, Also qualified for 2009 ICC World Twenty20. The country has been considered one of the stronger \"minnow\" nations for some time. Netherlands beat England in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 which is one of the biggest wins in Dutch cricket history. One year later they recorded their first ODI win against a full ICC member when they beat Bangladesh. Although the sport is sustained by a small player base, some have won professional contracts in England. Netherlands is ranked within the top 15 teams in the world and has co-hosted the ICC Cricket World Cup in 1999.\nIn February 2011, The Netherlands posted their highest ever total against a full-member nation, scoring 292 against England, batting first at the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Ryan Ten Doeschate top scored 119 from 110 balls.

        "title": "WrestleMania XXVII",
        "text": "WrestleMania XXVII was the 27th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on April 3, 2011, at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia. The event was the first WrestleMania held in the state of Georgia and the second to be held in Southeastern United States, following WrestleMania XXIV. It was also the final WrestleMania held during the first brand extension, which ended in August, but was reinstated in July 2016. This was also the company's final event to be promoted under the full name of World Wrestling Entertainment, as immediately following this event, the company strictly began to refer to itself by the WWE abbreviation. Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson served as the host of the event.\nThe event's card consisted of eight matches, including three main matches. The final match of the event was the main match from Raw, where The Miz defeated John Cena to retain the WWE Championship thanks to help from The Rock, setting up the main event of WrestleMania XXVIII between Rock and Cena. SmackDown's main match saw Edge defeat Alberto Del Rio to retain the World Heavyweight Championship—this would be Edge's final match until 2020. In the other marquee match, The Undertaker defeated Triple H in a No Holds Barred match to extend his undefeated WrestleMania streak to 19–0. This is the first and so far only WrestleMania in which no championships changed hands.\nTickets for the event commenced sale to the public on November 13, 2010. According to WWE's second-quarter earnings report, WrestleMania XXVII generated 1,059,000 PPV buys, up roughly 30% domestically and 15% internationally from the previous year. The event grossed US$6.6 million in revenue with 71,617 in attendance, making it the third highest grossing event in WWE behind WrestleMania 25 and the next year's event WrestleMania XXVIII. It generated $62.1 million in economic impact for Atlanta, a $17 million increase from the previous WrestleMania event, and also generated approximately $7.8 million in local, state and county taxes.\nCritically, the event received a mixed reception. Praise went towards the World Heavyweight Championship match, Punk vs. Orton, and Triple H vs. The Undertaker. Criticism went towards the tag matches, the main event, and Lawler vs. Cole, the latter of which has been named one of the worst matches in WrestleMania history.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nWrestleMania is considered World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) flagship pay-per-view (PPV) event, having first been held in 1985. It has become the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of WWE's original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". WrestleMania XXVII was scheduled to be held on April 3, 2011, at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia. It featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brands.\nIn September 2009, it was reported that the city of Atlanta was seeking to host WrestleMania XXVII at the Georgia Dome. Atlanta's main rival bid came from the city of Miami, Florida, which proposed to host the event at Sun Life Stadium along with \"WrestleMania Axxess\" at the Miami Beach Convention Center and the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony at the American Airlines Arena. Miami would eventually become the host for WrestleMania XXVIII. Atlanta was formally announced as the site at a press conference on February 1, 2010. According to WWE's senior vice president of special events, John Saboor, Atlanta was ultimately chosen for, among other reasons, \"their track record of success with large events, rich in its tradition with the WWE, and great infrastructure.\" The event marked the first time WrestleMania was held in the state of Georgia.\nAlong with WrestleMania XXVII, a series of events grouped as \"WrestleMania Week\" was held in the week preceding the event including WrestleMania's annual \"WrestleMania Axxess\" fan convention, the 2011 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony, the fourth annual \"WrestleMania Art\" exhibition and auction, and a Celebrity Pro-Am Golf tournament. \"WrestleMania Axxess\" was held at the Georgia World Congress Center, while the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony took place at the Philips Arena. It was the first pay-per-view event under WWE's promotional rights deal with Kmart. Under the deal, Kmart will be the official sponsor for all of WWE's live events in the United States for the rest of 2011. As another part of the promotion for the event, \"WWE Magazine\" released a \"Guide to WrestleMania XXVII\" app for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, offering information about the upcoming event as well as trivia from past events.\n\"Written in the Stars\" by Tinie Tempah was the theme song for the event. \"Diamond Eyes (Boom-Lay Boom-Lay Boom)\" by Shinedown served as the secondary theme song, while R&amp;B singer Keri Hilson performed \"America the Beautiful\" at the start of the show. Celebrities and former wrestlers that appeared in WrestleMania XXVII segments include Snoop Dogg, Pee Wee Herman, Gene Okerlund, Mae Young, and Roddy Piper.\nOn August 13, 2011, a one-hour special including the opening segment, the Triple H vs. Undertaker match, and the post-WrestleMania confrontation between The Rock and John Cena was broadcast on NBC under the title WrestleMania XXVII: The World Television Premiere.\nStorylines.\nThe professional wrestling matches at WrestleMania XXVII featured professional wrestlers performing as characters in scripted events pre-determined by the hosting promotion, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Storylines between the characters were produced on WWE's weekly television shows \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\" with the Raw and SmackDown brands—storyline divisions in which WWE assigned its employees to different programs.\nThe predominant rivalry for the Raw brand involved Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, John Cena and the reigning WWE Champion, The Miz. On the February 14 episode of \"Raw\", The Rock was announced as host for WrestleMania XXVII. In his first appearance in a WWE ring in seven years, The Rock publicly mocked both Miz and Cena. At the following week's Elimination Chamber event, Cena won the Raw brand's annual Elimination Chamber match to earn himself a WWE Championship opportunity against Miz. One night later on \"Raw\", both Cena and Miz derided The Rock's previous comments, with Cena producing a rap questioning The Rock's true commitment to WWE over his acting career. Via satellite, Rock responded to Cena's rap on the February 28 edition of \"Raw\", citing that he started a movie career to help open the door for other wrestlers to go to Hollywood, including Miz and Cena himself. On the March 28 episode of Raw, Rock and Cena confronted each other face to face before WrestleMania, until Miz came out. Miz and his protégé, Alex Riley, attacked The Rock, who managed to fight back both men. After the assault, Cena performed an Attitude Adjustment on Rock to end the show.\nStarting from the January 31 episode of \"Raw\", mysterious vignettes began promoting the return of a mysterious wrestler on \"2.21.11\". On the February 21 edition of \"Raw\", The Undertaker was revealed as the mysterious figure, who made his return after a four-month absence. However, Undertaker's return was interrupted by a returning Triple H. The two men stared each other down and both peered at the WrestleMania sign, teasing a possible challenge at WrestleMania XXVII. The match was confirmed four days later on WWE's official website. This match marks the second time the two would face each other at a WrestleMania, the first being WrestleMania X-Seven ten years earlier. Before their WrestleMania match, both men had a face to face encounter on the March 28 episode of \"Raw\", only to be interrupted by Shawn Michaels, who criticized Triple H for believing that he could defeat The Undertaker at WrestleMania, something that Michaels wasn't able to do at the previous years' event. After The Undertaker stated that Michaels was history, Michaels attempted to perform a Superkick on him, but The Undertaker retaliated with a Chokeslam that was stopped by Triple H, who then asked Michaels why he is going to defeat The Undertaker at WrestleMania. Michaels, however, left the ring, unable to give Triple H an answer, believing that Triple H couldn't defeat The Undertaker at the event.\nSince 1993, the winner of the annual Royal Rumble match at the January event of the same name has won the opportunity to fight for a world championship at WrestleMania. Alberto Del Rio won the match in 2011 and challenged Edge for the World Heavyweight Championship. This led to a series of assaults from Del Rio to Edge in the following weeks. However, Edge was joined by the returning Christian, who aided Edge from Del Rio and his bodyguard Brodus Clay, and proceeded to be in Edge's corner at WrestleMania.\nIn December 2010, \"Raw\" color commentator Jerry Lawler began a feud with fellow announcer Michael Cole when the anonymous Raw General Manager gave Lawler a WWE Championship match in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match against defending champion The Miz. As Lawler started to climb the ladder to retrieve the belt, Cole interfered and prevented Lawler from winning the match. On the February 21 edition of \"Raw\", Cole mocked Lawler for losing his rematch against The Miz at Elimination Chamber as well as his dreams of having a WrestleMania match, going as far as even mentioning Lawler's mother who died weeks earlier. Lawler responded by challenging Cole to a match at WrestleMania, which Cole denied before running through the crowd. A week later, Cole accepted Lawler's challenge under two conditions – that his trainer Jack Swagger would be in his corner, and that he could choose a special guest referee – which Lawler accepted. The following week, Cole revealed John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) as the special guest referee. However, Steve Austin, who made his return that night, interfered in the contract signing by delivering a Stone Cold Stunner to JBL and signing the contract himself, thereby becoming the special guest referee of their match. Cole continued to insult Lawler on the following weeks, even bringing Lawler's son Brian Christopher, who insulted Lawler, and calling him a bad father, before slapping him in the face and leaving. After that, Jim Ross, Lawler's best friend, confronted Cole and called him a \"rat bastard\", for which Swagger attacked Ross, and later Lawler, who attempted to save Ross.\nAnother plot building up towards WrestleMania involved CM Punk and Randy Orton. At the beginning of the year, Punk became the leader of The New Nexus. At the Royal Rumble pay-per-view, Punk cost Orton his WWE Championship match against defending champion The Miz. The following night on \"Raw\", Orton retaliated by assaulting Punk's fellow New Nexus members Michael McGillicutty and Husky Harris, resulting in Harris being punted in the head. On the February 7 episode of \"Raw\", Punk revealed that his actions were his revenge on Orton for punting him in the head at Unforgiven in September 2008, where Punk was unable to defend his World Heavyweight Championship due to Orton's attack and subsequently forced to vacate his title. On February 28, the anonymous Raw general manager scheduled a match between Punk and Orton at WrestleMania. In addition, the General Manager announced that Orton would face one of the members of the New Nexus throughout the following weeks. If Orton lost, his opponents would be allowed to be in Punk's corner at WrestleMania; if he won, his opponent would be banned from attending the event. Orton won all of his matches, so Michael McGillicutty, David Otunga, and Mason Ryan were all banned from ringside at the event. After each victory, Orton would punt each member in the head in order to send a message to Punk. On the March 21 episode of \"Raw\", Punk distracted Orton during his \"WrestleMania Rewind\" match with Rey Mysterio and used Orton's wife as bait to lure him to the parking lot, where he attacked Orton's knee with a wrench. The following week, on the \"Raw\" before WrestleMania, both men brawled with each other, which ended after Punk performed a \"Go To Sleep\" on Orton after taking advantage of his injured knee.\nAnother feud heading into WrestleMania was between Rey Mysterio and Cody Rhodes. On the January 21 edition of \"SmackDown\", Mysterio and Rhodes had a match in which Mysterio broke the nose of Rhodes with the 619. Rhodes, who underwent facial reconstruction surgery, later accused Mysterio of forcing him to miss the Royal Rumble match and the Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship, as well as ruining his 'dashing' gimmick. On the February 25 edition of \"SmackDown\", Cody's father, Dusty Rhodes, came out to talk to Mysterio and asked Rhodes to apologize for his accusation, but it turned out to be a setup to allow Rhodes to attack and unmask Mysterio. The next week Rhodes challenged Mysterio to a match at WrestleMania, which was accepted by Mysterio. The following week, Rhodes attacked Mysterio again, during Mysterio's match against Drew McIntyre. However, Mysterio retailed the following week, attacking Rhodes, until Rhodes escaped the ring.\nOn the March 14 episode of \"Raw\", Nicole \"Snooki\" Polizzi appeared as a guest star and exchanged insults with Vickie Guerrero backstage. Later that night, Vickie defeated Trish Stratus with the help of LayCool (Michelle McCool and Layla). After the match, Snooki, who observed the match at ringside, took down LayCool after being provoked by McCool. A brawl ensued between Snooki &amp; Stratus and LayCool until LayCool retreated from the ring. Vickie then proposed a six-person mixed tag team match at WrestleMania between LayCool &amp; her boyfriend, Dolph Ziggler, and Snooki, Stratus, and John Morrison which Snooki accepted. In the buildup to the match, a vignette aired, showing Snooki and Stratus in a bar, where Stratus said that they were training for their WrestleMania match. On the vignette, Snooki fought a man, and later Snooki and Stratus fought LayCool on the bar after LayCool started mocking Snooki and Stratus.\nIn an eight-man tag team match, The Corre (Wade Barrett, Ezekiel Jackson, Justin Gabriel and Heath Slater) were originally scheduled to wrestle Big Show, Kane, Santino Marella and Vladimir Kozlov at WrestleMania. The Corre had been going after Show on \"SmackDown\", but Show and Kane joined forces to beat down The Corre on Raw two weeks before WrestleMania. Later, Kane and Show helped Kozlov &amp; Marella fend off an attack by The Corre. On April 2, after a WrestleMania Axxess match between Kozlov and Tyler Reks, The Corre attacked Kozlov, leaving his shoulder injured. Kofi Kingston, who recently lost the Intercontinental Championship to Barrett, was chosen as Kozlov's replacement.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nBefore the event aired, two dark matches took place. In the first match pitted Sheamus against Daniel Bryan in a lumberjack match for the United States Championship. During the match, a brawl broke out between the lumberjacks outside the ring, resulting in the match ending in a no contest. SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long then called for a battle royal to take place. The Great Khali won the match after last eliminating Sheamus.\nPreliminary matches.\nAs the show went live on pay-per-view, R&amp;B singer Keri Hilson performed \"America the Beautiful\". Soon after, The Rock, the guest host, walked to the ring and cut a promo, mocking John Cena as well as firing up the crowd for WrestleMania.\nIn the first match Edge (with Christian) defended the World Heavyweight Championship against the 2011 Royal Rumble winner Alberto Del Rio (with Ricardo Rodriguez and Brodus Clay). Early in the match, Del Rio focused on Edge's injured arm and Christian fended off Clay and Rodriguez. After some back and forth action, the ending came when Edge applied the Edgecator while Del Rio applied the Cross Armbreaker. When both men got up, Edge delivered the Spear for the win. After the match, Edge and Christian destroyed Del Rio's car. This was Edge's last televised match, as he retired the next week on \"Raw\" due to a legitimate neck injury. Edge has since been medically cleared to wrestle again, returning to in-ring competition nearly 9 years later at the 2020 Royal Rumble.\nThe next match pitted Cody Rhodes against Rey Mysterio, who came out dressed as Captain America. Rhodes dominated most of the match, however, Mysterio managed to gain control later on. The ending saw Mysterio removed Rhodes' face mask and deliver headbutts but Rhodes countered by removing Mysterio's knee brace. When Rey went for a dive, Rhodes knocked out Mysterio with the knee brace and executed the Cross Rhodes for the win.\nIn the next match, Kane, Big Show, Santino Marella and Kofi Kingston faced The Corre (Wade Barrett, Ezekiel Jackson, Heath Slater and Justin Gabriel) in an 8-Man Tag Team Match. The match lasted two minutes, ending with Slater receiving a Cobra from Santino and a WMD from Big Show. Big Show then pinned Slater to win.\nIn the next match, Randy Orton faced CM Punk, with the New Nexus banned from ringside. Punk spent most of the match focusing on Orton's injured knee until Orton gained control later in the match. Orton then attempted a punt kick, but his injured knee stopped him. Punk attempted the GTS, but Orton went for an RKO. Punk dodged and went for a Springboard clothesline, but Orton delivered an RKO for the win.\nIn the next match, Michael Cole (with Jack Swagger) faced Jerry Lawler, with Stone Cold Steve Austin as the special guest referee. For this match, Booker T and Jim Ross joined Josh Mathews on commentary. The match began with Lawler trying to get Cole out of his \"Cole Mine\", a small glass box that Cole would announce from. After some time, he did so and started attacking him. Cole managed to counter and had the upper hand on Lawler for most of the match. Swagger tried to help Cole by throwing in the towel when Lawler began to take control but was denied and received a Stone Cold Stunner. Lawler then forced Cole to submit with the ankle lock while Stone Cold mocked him. After the match, Stone Cold shared a beer with Lawler and stunned Booker T, who came out to celebrate with Lawler. After Lawler had seemingly won, the anonymous Raw GM reversed the decision in an email read by Mathews because Stone Cold was a biased referee, making Cole the winner by disqualification. Stone Cold then proceeded to stun Mathews as well in retribution. Lawler then replaced Mathews and Booker T as the color commentator for the rest of the night, with Jim Ross doing the play-by-play.\nIn the next match, The Undertaker faced Triple H in a No Holds Barred Match. Triple H entered to \"For Whom The Bell Tolls\" by Metallica wearing a mask and suit, then removed it for his normal entrance theme. Undertaker entered to \"Ain't No Grave\" by Johnny Cash wearing a hat and suit, although this is replaced with his original entrance music on the WWE Network. The match began with Undertaker and Triple H brawling outside of the ring, destroying Michael Cole's \"Cole Mine\" in the process. Triple H delivered a spinebuster to Undertaker through a broadcast table. The match went back and forth, as Undertaker delivered a Chokeslam and a Last Ride, but Triple H kicked out of both. After, Triple H performed a Pedigree for a near-fall. Undertaker then performed the Tombstone Piledriver for a near-fall. Triple H then hit Undertaker with a chair to the head and delivered a DDT on the chair. After more back and forth action, Triple H executed a second Pedigree for another near-fall. Triple H immediately delivered the third Pedigree for a near-fall. After many steel chair shots, and telling Undertaker to stay down, Triple H executed Undertaker's Tombstone Piledriver for a near-fall. Triple H then grabbed a sledgehammer, but Undertaker applied Hell's Gate on Triple H. Eventually, Triple H submitted, meaning Undertaker's WrestleMania streak continued to 19–0. And the record is displayed on stadium screens. After the match, WWE Medical Staff had to help the Undertaker after he collapsed outside the ring and couldn't walk under his own power.\nThe penultimate match was a six-person mixed tag team match, which saw John Morrison, Trish Stratus, and Nicole \"Snooki\" Polizzi competing against a team consisting of Dolph Ziggler and LayCool (Michelle McCool and Layla). The match lasted a few minutes, with the ending coming when Morrison delivered Starship Pain on the outside of the ring to Ziggler and Snooki performed a cartwheel splash on McCool to get the win for her team.\nMain event.\nIn the last match, John Cena challenged WWE Champion The Miz (accompanied by Alex Riley). During the match, Cena delivered the Five Knuckle Shuffle to The Miz. Cena attempted the Attitude Adjustment, but Miz countered with a DDT. There was a lot of back and forth action until The Miz executed the Skull Crushing Finale and Cena executed an Attitude Adjustment on Miz – both for near-falls. Both men fought outside of the ring, knocking each other out in the process, and were counted out. The Rock came out to intervene, when a message from the Anonymous Raw General Manager arrived. The Rock went to read it, but then disregarded it and restarted the match under no disqualification, no count-out, no time limit stipulations. Cena dragged Miz back inside the ring and attempted an Attitude Adjustment. The Rock stalked Cena from behind and performed a Rock Bottom on him, in vengeance for the Attitude Adjustment six nights prior. Taking advantage, The Miz then pinned Cena for the win, retaining the WWE Championship, and became the second heel to win in the main event of WrestleMania. After the match, The Rock had a staredown with Miz until Rock delivered a spinebuster and a People's Elbow. WrestleMania XXVII went off the air with The Rock posing on top of the turnbuckles for the fans.\nReception.\nWrestleMania XXVII received mixed reviews from critics. Canadian Online Explorer's professional wrestling section gave the entire event 6.5 out of 10. The World Heavyweight Championship match received an 8 out of 10, the Undertaker–Triple H match received an 8.5 out of 10, the WWE Championship match received a 5 out of 10 and the CM Punk–Randy Orton match received a 7 out of 10.\nThe attendance record for WrestleMania XXVII was announced as 71,617. WWE's number was later confirmed by officials at the Georgia Dome.\nThe match between Michael Cole and Jerry Lawler is considered one of the worst WrestleMania matches of all time, as well as one of the worst in the WWE. Dave Meltzer gave the match 1 star out of 5. Vince McMahon himself stated to Michael Cole after the match that it was \"the worst thing [he'd] ever witnessed in 60 years.\" The match was criticised by fans for being too long, involving a non-wrestler in Cole and for the Anonymous Raw General Manager's reversing of Lawler's initial victory.\nAftermath.\nThe following night on \"Raw\", John Cena and The Rock agreed to face each other in a match at WrestleMania XXVIII, marking the first time a match had been announced almost a year in advance for any WrestleMania. Later on Cena won the WWE Championship in a Triple Threat Steel Cage match against The Miz and John Morrison at Extreme Rules. The \"Raw\" after Extreme Rules, Cena defended the WWE Championship against The Miz in a singles match after being restarted due to the referee noticing interference from Alex Riley after Miz winning, and again later on in an \"I Quit\" match at Over the Limit against Miz. Later in a backstage segment Cena \"congratulated\" The Rock on his birthday, telling him to bring it on for WrestleMania while showing off the WWE Championship, implying that their match at WrestleMania XXVIII will be for the WWE Championship, continuing on with their feud. However, Cena would go on to lose the WWE title three times that year, twice to CM Punk, and once to Alberto Del Rio. In November, at Survivor Series, Cena teamed with the Rock, which would be the latter's first match since WrestleMania XX in 2004 (which coincidentally was at Madison Square Garden in New York City), and defeated the Miz and R-Truth, only for Rock giving a \"Rock Bottom\" on Cena after the match. The Rock defeated Cena at WrestleMania XXVIII, and, in 2013, a rematch at WrestleMania 29 took place, with The Rock's WWE Championship on the line, which saw Cena emerging victorious.\nOn the April 11 \"Raw\", Edge retired due to a legitimate neck injury, marking his last match for the company against Del Rio at WrestleMania. Edge vacated the World Heavyweight Championship on the April 15 edition of \"SmackDown\", therefore retiring as world champion and leaving WWE full-time to make part-time appearances for the company. At Extreme Rules, Christian won the title for the first time in a ladder match against Del Rio, only to lose the title to Randy Orton, on the May 6 episode of \"SmackDown\". The next year Edge would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. However after nine years and two neck surgeries, Edge returned as a surprise entrant in the men's Royal Rumble match at the 2020 Royal Rumble, and then entered into a feud with Randy Orton, 2021 Royal Rumble, won by last eliminating Randy Orton in the Win.\nFollowing their loss at WrestleMania (not to mention failing to regain the Divas Championship), tension rose in LayCool. After two weeks of couples therapy, a bitter Michelle McCool turned on Layla, dissolving their team. Layla and McCool would face off in a match at the Extreme Rules pay-per-view with no count-outs, no disqualifications, and the loser has to leave WWE. Layla went on to win the match, resulting in McCool's subsequent – and legit – departure from WWE.\nAs a consequence of using a chair shot to the head, Triple H and The Undertaker were legitimately fined by the WWE for violating the company's \"concussion policy\" at the event. After a ten-month hiatus, The Undertaker returned on January 30, 2012 episode of Raw to confront Triple H before challenging him to a rematch at WrestleMania XXVIII, having felt unsatisfied with having to leave victorious not under his own power. After Triple H refused despite insistence from Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker mocked him by calling him a coward and knowing that Michaels was better than him. This angered Triple H to the point that he finally accepted The Undertaker's challenge, but under the stipulation that their match be a Hell in a Cell match. Soon after the match was made, Michaels confirmed he would officiate the match as special guest referee. Undertaker defeated Triple H at WrestleMania XXVIII with their match dubbed as an \"End of an Era\" and extended his Undefeated WrestleMania Streak to 20–0.\nWrestleMania XXVII was the last WWE pay-per-view to be promoted under the promotion's full name of World Wrestling Entertainment, as just after the event on April 7, the company began to refer to itself solely as \"WWE\", with the abbreviation becoming an orphaned initialism. It was also the last WrestleMania held under the first brand split, which ended in August, although the brand split was reintroduced in July 2016."

The much anticipated return of Tiger Woods came on Thursday, who shot a 4-under 68. This was a good opening for Woods, who had never before shot a first round in the 60s at the Masters. But the story of the day was the two Champions Tour players, 60-year-old Tom Watson and 50-year-old Fred Couples, who shot 67 and 66 respectively. Major champions Phil Mickelson and Y.E. Yang were one stroke back of leader Couples along with Lee Westwood, K. J. Choi, and Watson.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, April 9, 2010\"\nPhil Mickelson shot a 1-under 71 despite missing a 1-foot putt on Hole 5. Fred Couples and Tom Watson both fell back after solid opening rounds. Englishmen Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter shared the lead heading into the weekend.\nAmateurs: \"Manassero (+3)\", Smith (+5), Benjamin (+6), An (+11), Han (+11), Martin (+11).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, April 10, 2010\"\nLee Westwood continued his solid play in the third round to stay in the lead.

Overnight leader Lee Westwood started erratically, while Phil Mickelson parred his first seven holes. K. J. Choi was briefly tied for the lead at -12 with a birdie at 10 but he eventually fell back to a tie for fourth with playing partner Tiger Woods (they were paired together for all four rounds of the tournament). Twenty-four-year-old Anthony Kim shot a blistering 65, including a -5 run over four holes; he finished third. But down the stretch, Mickelson pulled away from Westwood with a bogey-free round of 67 to win the tournament.\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\""

        "title": "First indoor ice hockey game",
        "text": "On , the first recorded indoor ice hockey game took place at the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal, Quebec. Organized by James Creighton, who captained one of the teams, the game was between two nine-member teams, using a rubber \"puck\". Members used skates and sticks used for outdoor hockey and shinny games in Nova Scotia, where Creighton was born and raised. It is recognized as the first organized ice hockey game.\nVictoria Rink.\nThe Victoria Skating Rink was a long (), two-story brick edifice with a -high pitched roof supported from within by curving wooden trusses, which arched over the entire width of the structure. Tall, round-arched windows punctuated its length and illuminated its interior, while evening skating was made possible by 500 gas-jet lighting fixtures set in coloured glass globes. At a later date, the lighting was converted to electric, making the building the first in Canada to be electrified.\nThe ice surface measured , dimensions very similar to today's National Hockey League (NHL) ice rinks. It was surrounded by a -wide platform, or promenade, which was elevated approximately above the ice surface and upon which spectators could stand or skaters could rest. Later, a gallery was added with a royal box for visiting dignitaries.\nAt the time of its construction, the rink's location at 49 Drummond Street (now renumbered to 1187) placed it in the centre of the English community in Montreal, in the vicinity of McGill University. The area is known today as the \"Square Mile\", the area of central Montreal populated then by rich English industrialists and the budding centre of commerce in Canada. One block east was Dominion Square, where annual outdoor winter sporting events and later the Montreal Winter Carnival were held. Across the street to the east, the Windsor Hotel, a long-time centre of social life and meeting place of several sports organizations, was built in 1875. Nearby is old Windsor Station, which was the eastern terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway, built in 1889.\nGame.\nIn 1873, James Creighton, a member of the Victoria Skating Club and a figure skating judge, started organizing sessions of shinny at the rink, played informally between members of the Club and friends. The rules followed were developed from the informal rules of the outdoor game played in Nova Scotia where Creighton was born and raised, and adapted to the indoors setting and the rink's size.\nFirst game.\nOn March 3, 1875, the Rink hosted what has been recognized as the first organized ice hockey game, between members of the Victoria Skating Club, organized by Creighton. The match lays claim to this distinction because of factors which establish its link to modern ice hockey: it featured two teams (nine players per side) with a recorded score. Games prior to this had mostly been outdoors. In order to limit injuries to spectators and damage to glass windows, the game was played with a \"flat block of wood\" instead of a lacrosse ball. The two teams, members of the club, included a number of McGill University students. Sticks for this game were imported from Nova Scotia. This first game was pre-announced to the general public in the pages of \"The Montreal Gazette\":\nVictoria Rink – A game of Hockey will be played at the Victoria Skating Rink this evening, between two nines chose from among the members. Good fun may be expected, as some of the players are reputed to be exceedingly expert at the game. Some fears have been expressed on the part of intending spectators that accidents were likely to occur through the ball flying about in too lively a manner, to the imminent danger of lookers on, but we understand that the game will be played with a flat circular piece of wood, thus preventing all danger of its leaving the surface of the ice. Subscribers will be admitted on presentation of their tickets.\nHOCKEY – At the Rink last night a very large audience gathered to witness a novel contest on the ice. The game of hockey, though much in vogue on the ice in New England and other parts of the United States, is not much known here, and in consequence the game of last evening was looked forward to with great interest. Hockey is played usually with a ball, but last night, in order that no accident should happen, a flat block of wood was used, so that it should slide along the ice without rising, and thus going among the spectators to their discomfort. The game is like Lacrosse in one sense – the block having to go through flags placed about 8 feet apart in the same manner as the rubber ball – but in the main the old country game of shinty gives the best idea of hockey. The players last night were eighteen in number – nine on each side – and were as follows: – Messrs. Torrance (captain), Meagher, Potter, Goff, Barnston, Gardner, Griffin, Jarvis and Whiting. Creighton (captain), Campbell, Campbell, Esdaile, Joseph, Henshaw, Chapman, Powell and Clouston. The match was an interesting and well-contested affair, the efforts of the players exciting much merriment as they wheeled and dodged each other, and notwithstanding the brilliant play of Captain Torrance's team Captain Creighton's men carried the day, winning two games to the single of the Torrance nine. The game was concluded about half-past nine, and the spectators then adjourned well satisfied with the evening's entertainment.\nThe nine-man per side practice would last until 1880, when it was reduced during the Montreal Winter Carnival ice hockey tournaments.\nAfter-game fight.\nNot reported in the \"Gazette\", but reported elsewhere was that there was fighting after the game. This fighting was not between the on-ice combatants, rather, it was between the hockey players and spectators and members of the Skating Club. Members of the Skating Club were opposed to the use of the skating rink for hockey as it took away hours from other skating activities and it damaged the ice. According to the Kingston, Ontario, \"Daily British Whig\" \"Shins and heads were battered, benches smashed and the lady spectators fled in confusion.\"\nIIHF recognition.\nIn 2002, the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) announced that it would acknowledge the site of Victoria Rink with \"a commemorative plaque or other historical site marker to remind the passers-by of the existence of the Victoria Skating Rink, the birthplace of organized hockey.\" The commemoration has been marked in two ways. On May 22, 2008, a commemorative plaque was dedicated at the nearby Centre Bell, along with a plaque honouring James Creighton. Further, the IIHF created the Victoria Cup, a trophy named for the arena, for which—along with 1 million Swiss francs—one National Hockey League team and the champion of the European Champions Hockey League play-off annually. The first Cup match was held in Berne, Switzerland on October 1, 2008 between the New York Rangers and the Metallurg Magnitogorsk. The next, and last, edition of the Victoria Cup was held in Zürich on September 29, 2009, between the ZSC Lions and the Chicago Blackhawks."

        "title": "Wales at the Rugby World Cup",
        "text": "The Rugby World Cup is a rugby union tournament held every four years and contested by the men's national teams of the member unions of World Rugby. The Wales national rugby union team has participated in all ten Rugby World Cup tournaments. Up to and including 2015, hosting of the tournament alternated between traditional rugby heartlands in the southern hemisphere and those in Europe. Wales was the primary host in 1999, with Cardiff's Millennium Stadium built to coincide with the event, and the other three tournaments played in Europe have also used venues in Wales to some degree. Cardiff's Millennium Stadium and its predecessor, the Cardiff Arms Park, will have hosted a total 21 matches over a total of four World Cups. This is the largest number of World Cup games hosted by one venue.\nThe 1987 tournament was Wales' most successful; they won all three pool matches and their quarter-final, before losing to New Zealand in the semi-finals. They then faced Australia in the third place play-off match, which they won 22–21. In the next two tournaments in 1991 and 1995, Wales failed to progress beyond the pool stage, winning just one match in each tournament. Both the 1999 and 2003 tournaments were more successful, with Wales qualifying for the quarter-finals both times. Wales hosted the event in 1999 and topped their pool only to lose to eventual winners Australia in the quarter-finals. In 2003, they finished second in their pool to New Zealand and faced England in the quarter-finals, where they lost to the eventual champions, despite scoring more tries than their opponents. In the 2007 World Cup, Wales again failed to progress from the pool stage. After a loss to Australia, and two wins against Japan and Canada, they lost by four points to Fiji, despite scoring more tries than their opponents. At the 2011 World Cup, Wales reached the semi-finals for the first time since 1987. Playing the semi-finals against France, Wales lost 9–8, in a game overshadowed by the 18th-minute sending off of Wales' captain Sam Warburton for a dangerous tackle against Vincent Clerc. At the 2015 World Cup Wales were in the same pool as Australia, England, Fiji and Uruguay. They finished second in the pool behind Australia and ahead of hosts England. South Africa defeated Wales in the quarter-final. In the 2019 World Cup, Wales were in pool D with Australia, Fiji, Georgia and Uruguay. They won all their group matches to finish top of the pool. After defeating France in the quarter-final, they lost to the eventual tournament winners South Africa in the semi-final.\n1991 UK, Ireland &amp; France.\nHosting.\nEngland was billed as the main host of the second tournament in 1991, hosting the opening ceremony, and final, though the hosting duties were shared between all countries which competed in the Five Nations Championship. France hosted eight games, England and Wales each hosted seven, and Scotland and Ireland five. The National Stadium in Cardiff hosted the third place playoff, whilst all of Pool C's matches were played in Wales. Wales were scheduled to feature in this pool, and all three of their pool matches were hosted in the National Stadium. One game each was played at the club grounds of Pontypridd, Pontypool and Llanelli.\nThe following Welsh stadiums were used:\n1999 Wales.\nHosting.\nWales was chosen by the International Rugby Board as the principal host for the 1999 event. The centrepiece venue of the tournament, hosting the opening ceremony and final was the Millennium Stadium, a new structure built on the site of the old National Stadium at Cardiff Arms Park at a cost of £126 million from private investment. An agreement was reached with the unions of all four rivals in the Five Nations Championship (England, France, Ireland and Scotland), so that, like 1991, the majority of the matches would take place outside the official host nation. In a unique tournament format there were five pools in the opening round. Each of the five unions competed in a separate pool, and acted as host for all of the matches within that pool. All Pool A games were held in Scotland, Pool B games in England, Pool C games in France and Pool E games in Ireland.\nWales hosted Pool D, also featuring Argentina, Samoa and Japan. Four of the pool games were at the Millennium Stadium, with one match each at Stradey Park, Llanelli's rugby stadium, and at The Racecourse, Wrexham, which usually featured Association Football.\nOf eleven knock-out games, the Millennium Stadium only hosted three; Australia's defeat of Wales in the quarter-final stage, and the third place play-off and final. The other fixtures were played for at a variety of European venues.\nThe following Welsh stadiums were used:\n2007 France.\nHosting.\nIn a more public bidding process, France beat England to win the right to host the 2007 World Cup. The WRU supported the French bid, in accordance with an agreement between the nations over the 1999 cup. As a result of that agreement, World Cup rugby returned to the Millennium Stadium for three pool matches (including two featuring Wales), and a quarter-final.\nIronically, as France were unexpected runners-up to Argentina in their group, the hosts found themselves competing in this, the only knock-out match held outside of their borders. The game was one of the highlights of the tournament, notable for a large number of reasons, though largely for being New Zealand's earliest exit from a Rugby World Cup, after the New Zealand Herald ran the hubristic headline 'France pose absolutely no threat to All Blacks'. The French squad's reply to the Haka, where the squad dressed in red, white and blue shirts, drew some attention, with a number of images of Sebastien Chabal's stony face appearing in the media the following day. Several controversial decisions by referee Wayne Barnes, provoked death threats from some fans. Statistical analysis by New Zealand company Verusco showed the match's playing time, that is time the ball is in play, was the longest of any of the 1,500 games they had ever recorded.\n2015 England.\nHosting.\nIn 2009 England were awarded the rights to stage the 2015 tournament. Owing to the proximity of Cardiff, the RFU made it clear that they intended to use the Millennium Stadium as part of its bid, despite initial reluctance from the IRB for multiple hosting nations. The Millennium Stadium hosted eight games in the tournament, more than in any previous world cup. These include two quarter-finals. This made Cardiff the only venue hosting knock-out matches with the exception of England's national stadium, Twickenham, as well as the venue with the second highest number of games. As Wales and England were drawn in the same group, Wales only had home advantage for two of their games, against Uruguay and Fiji.\nCardiff used the World Cup to promote tourism in the city, with estimates that the games would add over £300 million to the local economy. A 'Fan Zone' had been created within the grounds of Cardiff Arms Park with a large screen, for enjoying match days. Cardiff Council has commissioned an art installation to mark the tournament, grafting a rugby ball to the prominent Cardiff Castle, to make it appear the ball has smashed straight through the wall. This was similar to a publicity stunt from the 2007 World Cup, where a rugby ball hung from the centre of the Eiffel Tower. No other such sculptures had been created in the other 2015 venue cities."

        "text": " \nThe Ireland national rugby union team have played in all ten Rugby World Cup tournaments. They have reached the quarter-finals at all but two tournaments, but have yet to progress to the semi-finals. They have finished top of their pool on three occasions.\nIreland has competed at every Rugby World Cup since the tournament was first held in Australia and New Zealand in 1987.\nSummary.\nAfter a loss to Wales, Ireland finished second in their pool in 1987 but were then knocked out by Australia in their quarter final in Sydney.\nIn 1991 Ireland again lost only the one match in pool play (to Scotland). They again met the Australians in the quarter-finals, who defeated them by one point. Runner-up in their pool in 1995 to New Zealand, Ireland were defeated by France in their quarter-final in Durban.\nIreland finished second in their pool in 1999, behind Australia and went into the quarter-final play-offs (a system exclusive to the 1999 tournament). There they lost to Argentina, and thus, not being quarter-finalists, they were not given automatic entry into 2003.\nThey defeated Russia and Georgia to go through the 2003 World Cup as Europe 1. They finished second to Australia in their pool, and were knocked out by France in the quarter finals.\nThey started in the so-called \"Group of death\" with hosts France, Argentina, Namibia and Georgia in the 2007 Rugby World Cup. They played Namibia (the lowest ranked team in the World cup) in their opening game on 9 September which resulted in a narrow 32–17 win. Their progress was then put into doubt when they beat Georgia 14–10, not obtaining a bonus point. France's victory over Namibia 87–10 put Ireland's progression from the group in doubt, and this was compounded when the French defeated Ireland 25–3. Entering their last group match against Argentina, needing four tries to secure a bonus point without allowing Argentina anything, Ireland were defeated by 30 points to 15 and crashed out at the pool stage for the first time.\nIreland began their 2011 Rugby World Cup campaign on the back of four defeats in a series of warm-up tests in August, with a 22–10 victory over the United States in New Plymouth on 11 September. Failing to secure a bonus point against world cup minnows the United States, a team ranked far below Ireland, this was an unconvincing win. Contrary to preceding form, and indeed beating most commentators expectations, Ireland produced a memorable performance to defeat reigning tri-nations champions Australia 15–6 in their second pool game in Eden Park in Auckland on 17 September. This was the first Irish win against tri-nations opposition in the southern hemisphere in 32 years. It was also Ireland's first ever win against Australia in the Rugby World Cup. After comprehensive wins against Russia and Italy in the final two pool-stage matches, Ireland topped Pool C. This was the first ever time Ireland came first in a world cup pool. Ireland advanced to the quarter-finals to face Wales in Wellington. They were defeated 22–10 by the Welsh, thus ending their 2011 campaign.\nIreland topped Pool D of the 2015 Rugby World Cup with four victories and with two bonus points. Ireland beat Canada and Romania with bonus points in their first two games. Ireland then faced Italy, coming out on top 16–9, the only try coming from Keith Earls who surpassed Brian O'Driscoll as Ireland's leading Rugby World Cup try scorer with eight. The final pool game saw Ireland face France. The winner would set up a quarter final against Argentina and avoid the All Blacks. Ireland overcame the loss to injury of key players Johnny Sexton, Peter O'Mahony and Paul O'Connell to run out 24–9 winners. The victory set up another game for Ireland in the Millennium Stadium against Pool C runners up Argentina on 18 October 2015.

        "text": " The 2010 PGA Championship was the 92nd PGA Championship, played August 12–15 at the Straits Course of the Whistling Straits complex in Haven, Wisconsin (postal address Kohler).\nMartin Kaymer won his first major championship in a three-hole playoff over Bubba Watson. It was the second PGA Championship in six years at Whistling Straits, the first in 2004 was won by Vijay Singh, also in a playoff.\nOriginal venue.\nThis championship was originally slated for Sahalee Country Club, east of Seattle, which hosted in 1998 and was selected in 1999 to host the championship again in 2010. That decision was reversed by the PGA of America in January 2005, when it was abruptly moved to Whistling Straits, which had recently hosted the very profitable 2004 edition and set new attendance records.\nThe PGA of America stated that it was concerned about the possibility of reduced financial support in the Pacific Northwest, as it was scheduled to be held less than six months after the conclusion of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia. As of 2015, the PGA of America has yet to commit to return to Sahalee, with future venues selected through 2022. Whistling Straits hosted the PGA Championship again in 2015.\nField.\nThe following qualification criteria were used to select the field.

Play was suspended on Thursday evening with half the field yet to complete their rounds; a second fog delay on Friday morning further delayed completion of the first round. Matt Kuchar defied the stoppages to take the first round lead, chasing his first win after a year of top-10s. Teenager Noh Seung-yul was only one shot behind, in the group at four-under, looking to become the second successive Korean PGA Championship winner.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, August 13, 2010\"\nMatt Kuchar fired a second-round 69 to lead by one shot after day two. Fog again delayed the start by two and a half hours, but Kuchar was eight under at the close, one ahead of fellow American Nick Watney. The late start meant half the field would finish their rounds on Saturday.\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, August 14, 2010\"\nIn the third round, Liang Wenchong shot a course-record 64 and moved into a tie for fourth place. Overnight leader Matt Kuchar dropped back to seven under, and Nick Watney shot a 66 to take a three-stroke lead over Rory McIlroy and Dustin Johnson going into the final round. Half the 156 starters were forced to complete their seconds rounds on the Saturday after almost six hours were lost because of fog over the first two days.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, August 15, 2010\"\nSeven different players held at least a share of the lead in the final round. Overnight leader Watney collapsed with an 81 (+9), including a triple-bogey on the 7th hole when he hit his ball into the water after hearing a camera click. Steve Elkington made a run towards the end, tying for the lead with a birdie on 16, but bogeyed the last two holes to finish two strokes back. Bubba Watson frequently drove his tee shots over and shot 68, including a birdie on the 16th hole to tie for the lead. He finished at 277, 11-under par. Kaymer, who held the lead for most of the day, made a par putt at the 18th hole to tie Watson for the clubhouse lead. McIlroy had a 15-footer for birdie on the 72nd green to tie for the lead with Watson and Kaymer, but missed. Dustin Johnson birdied 16 and 17 to take a one-shot lead with one hole to play, but bogeyed the final hole to apparently tie for the lead. After further review, it was decided that he had \"grounded his club\" in a bunker just off the edge of the 18th fairway, which is a contravention of Rule 13.4 of the Rules of Golf. Johnson readily admitted that he grounded his club but he did not know that the sandy patch beside the 18th fairway from which he played his second shot was deemed to be a bunker. He was given a two-stroke penalty and fell into a tie for fifth place.\nComplete leaderboard\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nPlayoff.\nKaymer and Watson advanced to the three-hole aggregate playoff, played on the 10th, 17th, and 18th holes. Watson nearly drove the green on the short par-4 and capitalized with a birdie to take the early lead; Kaymer missed a long birdie putt and made par. On the par-3 17th, Kaymer tied Watson by making a 15-footer for birdie while Watson missed a 45-footer and had to settle for par. Tied with one hole remaining, the playoff was now effectively sudden-death on the par-4 18th. Both hit their tee shots into the right rough, and Watson played aggressively; he went for the green on his second shot but it fell well short, into the creek in front of the green. With Watson in the hazard, Kaymer elected to lay up from his poor lie and only advanced the ball a little ways up the fairway on his second shot, and hit his third shot within from the cup. After his drop from the hazard, Watson hit his fourth shot through the green into a bunker, but nearly holed the bunker shot for bogey that potentially could have extended the playoff. Kaymer's putt for par ended two feet (0.6 m) past and below the hole; he sank the bogey putt to win his first major championship.\nScorecard.\n\"Playoff\"\n\"Cumulative playoff scores, relative to par\"&lt;br&gt;\nTelevision.\nTelevision coverage was provided in the United States by CBS and TNT, and in the United Kingdom by Sky Sports."

The Spartans were coached by Jud Heathcote in his third year and played their home games at Jenison Field House in East Lansing, Michigan. They were members of the Big Ten Conference. The Spartans finished the season 26–6, 13–5 in Big Ten play to earn a share of the Big Ten championship. They received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament as the No. 2 seed in the Mideast region. They defeated Lamar, LSU, and No. 1-seeded Notre Dame to advance to the Final Four, only the school's second trip to the Final Four. They defeated Penn to advance to the national championship game where they defeated Indiana State to win the school's first national championship in basketball.\nPrevious season.\nThe Spartans finished the 1977–78 season 25–5, 15–3 in Big Ten play to win the Big Ten championship. They beat Providence in the first round of the NCAA tournament and Western Kentucky in the Mideast Regional semifinal. However, they lost to Kentucky in the Regional Final.\nSeason summary.\nMSU was led by star sophomore, Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson (16.1 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 8.2 assists per game), senior Greg Kelser (18.1 points and 8.5 rebounds per game), and sophomore Jay Vincent (13.7 points and 5.6 rebounds per game). The Spartans started the season well, finishing the non-conference season with an 8–1 record including a loss to No. 13 ranked North Carolina. They entered conference play as the No. 1-ranked team in the country.\nAfter winning their first two conference games, they lost four of their next six games to fall to a 4–4 record in the Big Ten, trailing first-place Ohio State by four games in the standings. However, Michigan State then won their next 10 games with wins over No. 7 Ohio State, at No. 15 Iowa, at No. 13 Ohio State, and No. 18 Purdue. A loss on the final day of the season to Wisconsin resulted in the Spartans slipping into a tie for the Big Ten championship with Iowa and Purdue. MSU received a bid to the NCAA tournament because of a better head-to-head performance against Big Ten rivals and a superior overall record (21–6). The Spartans finished the season ranked No. 3 in the country.\nMichigan State advanced to the Final Four by defeating Lamar, LSU and No. 1-seeded Notre Dame. In the Final Four, the second Final Four appearance in school history, they faced Penn, blowing them out 101–67 to earn a trip to the Championship. There, the Spartans faced No. 1-ranked and undefeated Indiana State led by senior Larry Bird. In what was the most-watched college basketball game ever, Michigan State defeated Indiana State 75–64 to win the school's first ever basketball National Championship.

        "text": "The 1978–79 Indiana State Sycamores men's basketball team is considered the greatest in the school's history. The Sycamores competed as members of the Missouri Valley Conference during the 1978–79 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, playing their home games at the Hulman Center in Terre Haute, Indiana. Led by first-year head coach Bill Hodges and National Player of the Year Larry Bird, Indiana State was unranked to begin the season, but swept through the regular season unbeaten. Bird led the number 1 ranked Sycamores to the national title game versus the Magic Johnson-led number 3 Michigan State Spartans, and ended the season as National runner-up with a record of 33–1 (16–0 MVC). To date, the 1978–79 Sycamores are the only team to advance this far in their first-ever NCAA appearance. They had been the last unbeaten team to reach the national title game until Gonzaga in 2021.\nRoster.\nThe Sycamores were led by Bird, the NCAA Player of the Year, and his 28.6 scoring average. He was followed by Carl Nicks’ 19.3 average. The starting lineup also included Miley, Alex Gilbert and Steve Reed. Heaton and Leroy Staley were key reserves. The remainder of the roster consisted of Tom Crowder, Eric Curry, Rod McNelly, Rich Nemcek, Bob Ritter and Scott Turner.\nSeason summary.\nIn 1979, the NCAA tournament championship game was the most-watched game in the history of the sport, in no small part because of Indiana State star Larry Bird. Bird was not a one-man show, but the unheralded Sycamores rode him to a 33–0 record heading into the title game. The well-rounded Bird averaged 29 points, 14.8 rebounds, and, most significantly, six assists as he changed the way the game was played.\nOffseason.\nHead coach Bob King suffered a stroke and was unable to continue as head coach of the Sycamores. Assistant Bill Hodges was elevated to the position of head coach.\nExhibition vs. Soviet National Team.\nOn November 20, the touring Soviet National team came to Hulman Center to play Indiana State. ISU defeated the Soviets, 83–79, to become one of only four college teams to beat them that season.\nRegular season.\nDuring the 1978–79 season, Indiana State qualified for the NCAA tournament. ISU finished the regular season 29–0, 16–0 in the Missouri Valley Conference, and earned the top ranking in the country.\nThe only time that the perfect regular season was in jeopardy was on Feb. 1. The Sycamores were 18–0 against New Mexico State. With three seconds remaining, the Sycamores were down 83–81. New Mexico State was at the free throw line and the shot was missed. The missed shot was rebounded by Brad Miley and passed to Bob Heaton. Heaton launched a 50-foot desperation shot which banked through the net to send the game into overtime.\nBird received several honors at the end of regular season. He won the USBWA College Player of the Year, Naismith and Wooden Awards, given to the year's top male college basketball player.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style= | Missouri Valley Conference tournament\n!colspan=9 style= | NCAA Tournament\nNCAA basketball tournament.\nThe top seed in the NCAA Midwest Regional was awarded to the Sycamores.

        "text": "Victor George Cavanagh (1874 - 11 June 1952), known as \"Old Vic\" Cavanagh, was a New Zealand rugby union administrator. He was born in Caversham, Dunedin. He was the father of \"Young Vic\" Cavanagh. Between them, they greatly affected the development of the sport of rugby within New Zealand.\nOld Vic was the first captain of Dunedin's Southern Club after its formation through the amalgamation of the Caversham and Pacific clubs in 1899. He also represented Otago that year, but became better known as a coach. Cavanagh coached Southern to three Otago championships before World War I, then after the war he became coach of the University A team, coaching them to ten championship wins between 1923 and 1934. He was also a national selector in 1913.\nIn 1929 Old Vic developed the ‘loose scrum’ technique to help lighter student forwards win ball in broken play. The new-look 3-4-1 scrum shape revolutionised forward play, and - with the refinements to what became known as \"the Southern style’ by Young Vic, led to the dominance of Otago in provincial rugby in the years prior to World War II."

        "text": "The 1992–93 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team represented the University of Michigan in intercollegiate college basketball during the 1992–93 season. The team played its home games in the Crisler Arena in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and was a member of the Big Ten Conference. Under the direction of head coach Steve Fisher, the team finished second in the Big Ten Conference. Although the team compiled a 31–5 record during the season, the National Collegiate Athletic Association has adjusted the team's record to 0–4 due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal. The team earned an invitation to the 1993 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament where it was national runner up. The team was ranked for the entire eighteen weeks of Associated Press Top Twenty-Five Poll, starting the season ranked first, holding the number one position for three weeks and ending ranked third, and it ended the season ranked fourth in the final USA Today/CNN Poll. The team had an 8–5 record against ranked opponents, including the following victories: December 28, 1992, against #20 Nebraska 88–73 in the Rainbow Classic at the Blaisdell Center, December 29 against #5 North Carolina 79–78 in the Rainbow Classic, December 30 against #2 Kansas 86–74 in the Rainbow Classic, January 7, 1993, against #9 Purdue 80–70 at Mackey Arena, February 2 against #25 Michigan State 73–69 at the Breslin Student Events Center, February 7 against #19 Purdue 84–76 at Crisler Arena, March 2 against #15 Iowa 82–73 at Crisler Arena, April 2 against #2 Kentucky 81–78 (OT) at the Superdome in the 1993 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.\nThe team had rotating captains on a game-by-game basis, and Chris Webber earned team MVP. The team's leading scorers were Chris Webber (690 points), Jalen Rose (555 points), and Juwan Howard (524 points). The leading rebounders were Webber (362), Howard (267), and Eric Riley (169).\nDuring the season the team set a Big Ten Conference record for single-season blocked shots (193) that would last until 2000.\nDuring the season, the team won the Big Ten Conference statistical championships in rebounding and rebounding margin with at 40.9 average and 7.6 average margin in conference games, respectively. The record-setting team also led the conference in average blocked shots (5.0). Chris Webber led the Big Ten in rebounds with a 9.7 average in 18 conference games and 10.1 average in 36 overall games.\nThe team surpassed the 30-win total by the 1989 team with 31 victories and was the winningest team in school history, until being matched by Michigan's 2012–13 team and later being surpassed by its 2017–18 team.\nFor the second year in a row, the team set the school record for single-season team blocks with 193 in 36 games, surpassing the 182 in 34 games set the prior year. The record would stand until 2007.\nFour players surpassed Jalen Rose's single-season minutes played record set the prior season. Rose set the new and current single-season record of 1234. King played 1174 minutes, while Webber and Howard contributed 1138 and 1135, respectively.\nRegular season.\nMichigan returned its top nine scorers and began the season ranked number one in the country by the Associated Press. Michigan lost its second game of the season in a rematch with Duke.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=\"12\" style=\"background:#; color:#;\"| Non-conference Regular season\n!colspan=\"12\" style=\"background:#; color:#;\"| Big Ten Regular season\n!colspan=\"12\" style=\"background:#; color:#;\"| NCAA Tournament\nNCAA tournament.\nMichigan was given the #1 seed in that year's West Regional and played their first and second-round games at the McKale Center in Tucson. They defeated Coastal Carolina in their first game and then were taken to overtime by #9 seed UCLA before escaping with a victory.\nThe Wolverines moved on to the Kingdome for the regionals. The sub-regional had been littered with upsets, as the #12, #13, and #15 seeds had all won in the first round. Michigan drew #12 seeded George Washington and won, then faced Temple for the second consecutive year (having defeated them as a #6 seed the year before) and beating them 77–72 to join Kentucky, Kansas, and North Carolina in the Final Four in New Orleans.\nIn their national semifinal at the Superdome on April 3, the team defeated Southeast Regional winner Kentucky 81–78 in overtime.\nIn the championship game at the Superdome on April 5, the Wolverines lost to East Regional winner North Carolina 77–71. Michigan's final possession of the game went down as one of the most memorable moments in college basketball history. With twenty seconds to go and Michigan trailing by two and out of timeouts, Chris Webber rebounded a missed free throw. Confused as to what to do next, Webber thought about passing to Jalen Rose but did not and took a step without dribbling the basketball. The officials did not see the travel, however, and Webber headed upcourt where North Carolina was set up in a half court trap defense. Webber ran directly into the trap and was double teamed in the corner. He could not break the double team to pass the ball, and called for a timeout that the Wolverines did not have. By rule, Michigan was given a technical foul for calling the extra timeout and North Carolina was given two free throws and possession of the ball. North Carolina made their free throws, then added two more when Michigan was forced to foul again after the change in possession.\nThe team established numerous NCAA records for three-point field goals in the final four: fewest single-game three-point field goals made in a final four (0 vs. Kentucky on April 3, 1993, in an overtime) and fewest single-game three-point field goals attempted (4 vs. Kentucky). The 0 three-point field goals made surpassed the team's previous record of 1 made against Duke the year before in the 1992 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.\nLater developments.\nIn 2002, the Wolverines vacated their entire 1992–93 season, including their tournament appearance, in the wake of a major scandal involving many years of improper payments from a major booster to several former players, among them Webber.\nStatistics.\nThe team posted the following statistics:\nTeam players drafted into the NBA.\nFive players from this team were selected in the NBA draft."

        "title": "List of Wales national rugby union players",
        "text": "List of Wales national rugby union players is a list of players who have represented Wales at rugby union. The list only includes players who have played in a Test match for the senior men's team. The players are listed in order of chronological appearance for the national team. Players that were first capped during the same match are listed in order of those that began in the starting line up before replacements and then in alphabetical order by surname.\nTen former Welsh internationals from the Wales national rugby union team have been inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame, while eight have been inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame. One Welsh player, Shane Williams in 2008, has been awarded World Rugby Player of the Year (formerly known as the International Rugby Board Player of the Year).\n1880s – 1950s.\nSomerset-born Frank Hancock, a 2011 inductee into the World Rugby Hall of Fame, changed the game of rugby when he was played as a fourth three-quarter for Cardiff. When given the captaincy of Wales in 1886 he trialed the system against Scotland, the very first international match to see four three-quarters play. Although the system was abandoned during the match, it was readopted by Wales in 1888 and was quickly absorbed by the other Home Nation countries. It is now the standard formation in world rugby.\nKnown as the \"Prince of three-quarters\", Gwyn Nicholls played 24 Tests for Wales at centre between 1896 and 1906. He was the only Welsh player in the British Isles team of 1899, and was the star for Wales during their first golden era. Not only did he captain Wales to three Triple Crowns, but also led them to their famous victory over the All Blacks in 1905. On 26 December 1949, gates bearing his name at Cardiff Arms Park were officially opened.\nBleddyn Williams and Jack Matthews, both centres who were inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame in 2013, were called by World Rugby \"a uniquely complementary and successful partnership at club, national team and Lions levels after the Second World War\". Both captained Cardiff and Wales, made their international debuts in 1947, and were on the Lions squad that toured Australia and New Zealand in 1950. Williams, nicknamed the \"Prince of Centres\", earned 22 caps for Wales and five for the Lions in an eight-year Test career. Wales won all five Tests in which he served as captain; at the time of his induction, he was the only Wales captain with a 100% winning record. Williams went on to become a prominent rugby commentator. Matthews, renowned for his strong tackling, earned 17 caps for Wales and six for the Lions, calling time on his Test career in 1951. After his playing career, he became the Lions' first team doctor, serving in that role during the 1980 tour to South Africa.\nNamed the greatest Welsh player of the 1950s by the WRU, Cliff Morgan played 29 Tests for Wales, and four for the British Lions between 1951 and 1958. Morgan played at fly-half and was one of the sport's biggest crowd-pullers during his career. He played during Wales' Five Nations Grand Slam of 1952, and their victory over the All Blacks in 1953, but he is most famous for captaining the British Lions in South Africa in 1955. One of Morgan's great friends was Carwyn James. Although most notable for his coaching record, James appeared for Wales in two Tests in 1958. He coached the British Lions to their only series victory over New Zealand in 1971, with a team including many Welsh players. He also coached Welsh club Llanelli, and the Barbarians side that defeated the All Blacks in 1973. Despite this, he never coached Wales. Morgan, inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame in 1997, was further honoured with induction into the World Rugby Hall of Fame in 2009.\n1960s – present.\nWhen Wales faced Australia on 3 December 1966, two future Rugby Hall of Fame members made their Test debuts; Gerald Davies and Barry John. Davies played 46 Tests for Wales between 1966 and 1978. Although he started out playing in the centre, he was moved to the wing during Wales' 1969 tour of New Zealand and Australia, and eventually scored 20 Test tries for Wales. Davies also played for the Lions during their 1968 tour of South Africa and 1971 tour of New Zealand. Barry John was also selected for the 1968 Lions' tour of South Africa. Playing at fly-half, he helped Wales to a Five Nations Grand Slam in 1971, and then the Lions to their one and only series win over the All Blacks that same year. His exploits on the Lions tour of 1971 were rewarded with the nickname of \"The King\" by the New Zealand press, though the pressure of expectation and fame saw him quit rugby the following year.\nWidely regarded as the greatest rugby union player of all time, Gareth Edwards played 53 Tests for Wales at scrum-half between 1967 and 1978. Edwards was never dropped from the team and played all 53 of his Tests consecutively. He also played in three Lions tours; including the series victories in New Zealand in 1971, and the unbeaten tour of South Africa in 1974. Edwards won five Triple Crowns with Wales and three Five Nations Grand Slams. He also scored a try for the Barbarians against the All Blacks in 1973, remembered as \"that try\" and considered one of the sport's greatest. In 2003, Edwards was voted the greatest player of all time by \"Rugby World\" magazine. In 2007, Edwards earned an additional honour with his induction into the World Rugby Hall of Fame.\nIn 1969, three Hall of Fame members debuted for Wales; Phil Bennett, Mervyn Davies, and JPR Williams. Bennett played 29 Tests for Wales. He started out playing at fullback, but after Barry John retired, he was moved to fly-half. As well as representing Wales, he played eight Tests for the Lions and captained them on their 1977 tour of New Zealand. Mervyn Davies was known as \"Merve the Swerve\" and played 38 consecutive Tests for Wales between 1969 and 1976, losing only eight of them. After captaining Wales in his last nine appearances, Davies was forced to retire due to a brain haemorrhage. JPR Williams played 55 Tests for Wales between 1969 and 1981. Playing at fullback, he won three Five Nations Grand Slams with Wales in the 1970s, and captained Wales in 1979. He also toured with the British Lions in 1971 and 1974, and in 2008 a readers poll in \"The Telegraph\" voted him the greatest Lions' fullback of all time.\nIeuan Evans played for Wales between 1987 and 1998, and in the process earned 72 Welsh caps while the nation was transcending the amateur and professional eras. Playing mainly on the wing, Evans scored 33 tries for Wales, a record until surpassed by Gareth Thomas in 2004. As well as that, he was awarded seven Lions caps from the 1989, 1993 and 1997 tours.\nIn November 2008, Shane Williams and Ryan Jones became the first Welsh players to be nominated in a group of five players for the World Rugby Player of the Year award, first awarded in 2001. Shane Williams was duly selected as the 2008 World Rugby Player of the Year. Leigh Halfpenny was nominated in 2013 and Alun Wyn Jones in 2015."

        "text": "The Broadmeadow Basketball Stadium, also known as the Newcastle Basketball Stadium, is an indoor basketball stadium located in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia and was the original home of the Newcastle Falcons of the National Basketball League from the origin of the league in 1979 until they moved to the newly built Newcastle Entertainment Centre in 1992. The stadium is currently the home of the Newcastle Basketball Association and can hold approximately 2,200 spectators.\nOn 18 July 1982, the stadium hosted the 1982 NBL Grand Final where the West Adelaide Bearcats defeated the Geelong Supercats 80–74. The staging of an NBL game in Newcastle without the Falcons playing was possible due to the NBL's original policy of awarding the then single game Grand Final to a pre-determined venue regardless of the teams playing. The stadium also hosted the 1982 semi-finals with West Adelaide defeating the Coburg Giants 94–74 and Geelong defeating the Nunawading Spectres 101–59. Both semi-final games were played on 16 July. The Stadium later hosted the 2006 ABA National Finals.\nOn 15 August 2015, the Stadium hosted the LSU Tigers college basketball team in an exhibition game against the Newcastle All-Stars, which LSU won 89–75. A capacity crowd of almost 2,000, the biggest for a game at the Broadmeadow venue in more than 25 years, packed in to see the NBA-bound forward Ben Simmons compete for his new college team. A former Hunters junior, Simmons learnt to play basketball at Broadmeadow when his father, Dave, played and coached in Newcastle for the Falcons and the Hunter Pirates."

The championship game featured two ranked teams for the first time since 2008. The #3 Bison of Oklahoma Baptist University held of the #13 Cougars of Azusa Pacific University. Azusa Pacific’s Marshall Johnson grabbed his teammate Dominique Johnson’s 2-point miss with nearly one second left, heaved a 10-foot fade-away; nothing but net. Azusa Pacific thought they had won the game, after review, the horn had sound prior to Johnson's shot giving the Bisons their 2nd NAIA championship since 1966. 2010 was Azusa Pacific 2nd trip to the Championship game.

Throughout the season, he tallied 12 points and was the top defenceman for Russia at the 2011 World Junior Championships.\nWashington Capitals.\nOnce the 2010–11 KHL season concluded, Orlov made his North American professional debut with the Hershey Bears, the American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate of the Capitals. While playing in the Bears' final 19 games of the regular season and six postseason contests, Orlov tallied two goals and 10 points. He made his AHL debut on 26 February 2011 in a 4–3 win over the Albany Devils where he also registered an assist. After recording another assist in his second game with the Bears, the Capitals signed Orlov to a three-year, entry-level contract. Orlov later scored his first North American professional goal in a 3–2 loss to the Worcester Sharks on 9 March 2011.\nOnce the season concluded, Orlov was invited to participate in the Capitals Rookie Camp in September 2011. While attending both the Capitals Rookie and Development Camps, Orlov was praised for his \"high-risk, high-reward style of play.\" Despite this, he was subsequently re-assigned to the AHL prior to the start of the 2011–12 season. Orlov recorded four goals and nine points through 15 games with the Bears before he earned his first NHL call-up on 20 November 2011. He made his NHL debut the following day against the Phoenix Coyotes where he played 11 minutes and 56 minutes and recorded three hits and one attempted shot on goal. Orlov remained with the Capitals following his debut and scored his first career NHL goal on 15 January 2012 against Cam Ward of the Carolina Hurricanes. He finished the season with three goals and 16 assists for 19 points through 60 games with the Capitals.\nAs a result of the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Orlov was assigned directly to the Hershey Bears to start the 2012–13 season. While with the Bears, Orlov suffered from two injuries that kept him out of the lineup for a period of time. His first injury came in November while his second came in December and caused him to miss attending the Capitals training camp in January. He ended up playing five games with the Capitals once the season began and tallied one assist.\nThe 2013–14 season also began slowly for Orlov. Due to a clause in his contract, Orlov was required to be on the Capital's active NHL roster for a total of 30 days or he would be allowed to join the KHL. As such, he was constantly being recalled and returned to the AHL without appearing in a game. He eventually earned a permanent spot in the line-up and remained with the Capitals for 54 games. During this time, he was suspended two games and forfeited $7,076.92 for boarding Brayden Schenn during a game. Following the suspension, the Capitals signed Orlov to a two-year contract extension worth $4 million on 13 March. Orlov finished the season with three goals and 11 points in 54 games with the Capitals before joining Team Russia at the 2014 IIHF World Championship. While playing at the tournament, he suffered a broken wrist which forced him to miss most of the 2014–15 NHL season. In March 2015, Orlov was re-assigned to the Hershey Bears on a conditioning stint after missing 74 games.\nAfter remaining sidelined for nearly a year, Orlov joined the Capitals for their 2015–16 training camp and pre-season. He played with the Capitals through all 82 games while on their third line pairing with either Nate Schmidt or Taylor Chorney. His playing time increased following injuries to Brooks Orpik and John Carlson and he moved up the defensive pairing once Orpik returned. He also accumulated only 26 penalty minutes and was the Capitals nominee for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy. Orlov helped the Capitals clinch the President's Trophy as they qualified for the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs.\nOrlov finished the 2016–17 season with career-highs in assists, points, and plus-minus through 82 games. As such, Orlov signed a six-year, $30.6 million contract extension with the Capitals on 30 June 2017.\nOn 19 January 2022, Orlov was suspended two games and forfeited $51,000.00 for kneeing Winnipeg Jets forward Nikolaj Ehlers during a game.\nBoston Bruins.\nWhile in his final year under contract with the Capitals in the 2022–23 season and contributing with 19 points in 43 regular season games, Orlov's 14-year tenure within the Capitals ended as he was traded to Minnesota and after the Wild retained part of his salary he was then sent to the league-leading Boston Bruins on 23 February 2023. Teammate Garnet Hathaway was traded in a separate trade on the same day in exchange for Craig Smith, a 2023 first-round pick, a 2025 second-round pick and a 2024 third-round pick. Orlov made his debut with the Bruins on 25 February, against the Vancouver Canucks, recorded two assists against the Edmonton Oilers on 27 February, and scored his first two goals as a Bruin in the following night's game against the Calgary Flames. In Orlov's first four games with the Bruins he tallied eight points, including back-to-back three-point games, making him the first Bruin to do so since Zdeno Chára in 2011. Orlov's scoring burst in his first games as a Bruin led him to be named the NHL's First Star of the Week on March 6. On March 11, he became the fastest defenseman to reach ten points in Bruins history, doing so in just seven games with the club.\nCarolina Hurricanes.\nIn the following off-season, having left the Bruins as a free agent, Orlov was signed to a two-year, $15.5 million contract with the Carolina Hurricanes on 1 July 2023.\nInternational play.\nOrlov represented Russia at the 2010 and 2011 World Junior Championships, getting named to the 2011 Tournament All-Star Team and winning the 2011 gold medal."

        "text": "Ireland is an international men's water polo team representing the island of Ireland. The Irish Water Polo Association (IWPA) was founded in 1964 and is affiliated to Swim Ireland.\nHistory.\nThe rules of water polo were originally developed by William Wilson in the mid-nineteenth century. The game was originally played in rivers and lakes in England and Scotland. Between 1890 and 1900, the game developed in Europe using British rules, but a different game was being played in the United States.\nDuring the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the four Home Nations — England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales — contested regular internationals against each other. Ireland were often outclassed, losing every match against England from 1895 to 1910. However, Noel Purcell won a gold medal on the Great Britain team at the 1920 Olympic water polo tournament.\nIn 1922, the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom and the Olympic Council of Ireland joined the International Olympic Committee. Purcell captained Ireland at the 1924 Olympics. Ireland had a bye in the first round when Austria pulled out. In the second round, they lost 4–2 against Czechoslovakia. At the 1924 Tailteann Games, Ireland beat a team representing England. \nIn the 1928 Olympic tournament, Ireland lost its only match 11–1 to Belgium. The expense of travel to Los Angeles ruled out participating in the 1932 tournament, and Ireland boycotted the 1936 Games in a dispute over Northern Ireland.\nIreland has not competed in the Olympics since 1928, and has never qualified for the World Championships. Although Home International matches continued into the 1960s, the transition to higher-specification indoor swimming pools was long delayed in Ireland. The outdoor sea baths at Clontarf and Blackrock fell into disuse. The IWPA was established in 1964 and the first pool to meet FINA regulations for length, breadth, and depth opened in 2002.\nRecent results.\n2007 European 'B' Championships.\nQualifying Group 'C', in Kotor, Montenegro:\nFinals, in Manchester:\nNote:\nSince 2008.\nIn February 2009, Ireland played a five-nation tournament in Denmark, losing all four matches.\nIn October 2019, Ireland competed in the 2019 FINA Water Polo Challengers' Cup, finishing 2nd in their group winning three out of the four games. Ireland lost the bronze-medal match to Indonesia 14-9 and therefore finishing fourth.\nResults summary.\nOlympic Games:\nEuropean Championship:\nFINA Challengers’ Cup:"

        "title": "1988 America's Cup",
        "text": "The 1988 America's Cup was the 27th America's Cup regatta, and was contested between the defender, San Diego Yacht Club represented by \"Stars &amp; Stripes H3\", and the challenger, the Mercury Bay Boating Club represented by New Zealand Challenge's \"KZ-1\". Run under strict Deed of Gift rules, the regatta was won by the San Diego Yacht club, in a two-race sweep.\nChallenge and response.\nThe 1988 America's Cup was the first hostile Deed of Gift challenge. Dennis Conner had won the America's Cup for the San Diego Yacht Club on 4 February 1987 at the 1987 America's Cup. In July, New Zealand banker Michael Fay went to the San Diego Yacht Club and issued a Notice of Challenge from the Mercury Bay Boating Club of New Zealand, which was based on a strict reading of the Deed of Gift. The Fay challenge stipulated that the boats to be sailed would be defined only by the details of the Deed, namely single masted yachts no more than at the waterline and that the race would be held the following year in 1988. He proposed to bring a 90-foot racing yacht for his challenge boat.\nThe San Diego Yacht Club, who wanted to continue running the Cup regatta in 12-metre class yachts, initially rejected Fay's challenge out of hand. Fay then took the dispute to the New York State Supreme Court, which on 25 November 1987 declared the challenge valid and instructed the San Diego Yacht Club to meet the challenge on the water, brushing aside the twenty-one 12 Meter syndicates that had declared their intention of racing in a 1991 America's Cup regatta.\nThe unconventional challenge was met with an unconventional response. As the challenge used the original Deed of Gift as its basis, there were no explicit class or design requirements other than that the boat was to be or less at the waterline if it had one mast. Thus the San Diego Yacht Club and the Sail America Foundation chose the assuredly faster multi-hull design.\nOn 5 May 1988 the Cup returned to the courts with Michael Fay seeking a court ruling that the catamaran was an invalid defender. The court instead ruled that the cup should be contested on the water, and any further legal action should be delayed until after the race.\nBoats.\nThe New Zealand challenger was \"KZ-1\", a monohull with a crew of 30 to 40. The boat was launched in March 1988 and regarded as the fastest monohull at that time for its size. \"KZ-1\" now resides outside the National Maritime Museum in downtown Auckland, New Zealand.\nThe San Diego Yacht Club responded by building two catamarans, one with a conventional soft sail (\"Stars &amp; Stripes S1\"), and the second with a Scaled Composites -built wing mast (\"Stars &amp; Stripes H3\"). The wing-masted boat demonstrated superior performance, and after being modified to improve its structural integrity was chosen for the successful defense.\nCrew.\n\"KZ-1\" was skippered by David Barnes and the afterguard included tactician Peter Lester, navigator Richard Morris, Tom Schnackenberg and Bruce Farr.\nThe crew, which numbered 40 also included Jeremy Scantlebury, Robert Salthouse, Don Cowie, Warwick Fleury, Mark Hauser, Andrew Taylor, Edwin Askew, Marcus Brown, Bill Handy, Keith Hawkins, George Jakich, Paul Matich, Rubin Muir, Chris Salthouse, Alan Smith, Nick Heron, David Hurley, Peter Warren, Michael Fay, lawyer Andrew Johns, designer Russell Bowler, Clive Brown, Mike Drummond, Bob Graham, Murray Greenhalgh, Peter Jeromsen, Lance Manson and Chris Wilkins.\nRod Davis was New Zealand's sailing coach.\n\"Stars &amp; Stripes\" was skippered by Dennis Conner and the crew included navigator Peter Isler, John Marshall, Malin Burnham, Carl Buchan, Cam Lewis, John Barnitt, Bill Trenkle, Duncan MacLane, Louis Banks, John Grant, John Wake, Randy Smyth and tactician Tom Whidden.\nAftermath.\nAfter the completion of the races the battle returned to the courts and on 28 March 1989 the cup was awarded to New Zealand on the basis that the competition between a monohull and a catamaran was a gross mismatch and not in the spirit of friendly competition between countries. However the Appellate Division reversed that ruling, saying the Deed of Gift does not limit design or say anything about the number of hulls a yacht may have, and the reversal was confirmed on 26 April 1990 by the New York Court of Appeals. Thus San Diego retained the cup, defending it again at the 1992 America's Cup.\nThe 27th America's Cup put an end to the 12-metre era of yachts as the International America's Cup Class was developed for the next Cup defense.\nThe 2010 America's Cup shared some similarities with the 1988 Cup in that it was also the subject of intense litigation, and the precedent set by the 1988 court decision guaranteed that any non-mutual consent match would be sailed in the fastest boats legal under the Deed: multihulls. The build up to the 2010 America's Cup was slightly different though, in that a challenge had already been accepted by defending yacht club Société Nautique de Genève, but the courts decided that the challenger did not meet the requirements of the Deed of Gift governing the cup and forced the defender to accept a challenge from the Golden Gate Yacht Club instead."

The team is a successor of the Soviet water polo team.\nHistory.\nIn the Russian Empire.\nWater polo in Russia dates back to 1910, when the sport was included into the national water sports programme. The Shuvalov school was opened back then, featuring rules that differed from the international rules. In 1913, the first water polo tournament was played between the Shuvalov school and Moscow, with the first winning 3–2. The new sport progressed in Russia, as all swimming organizations included this sport into their programme. P. Erofeev and A. Shemansky further populized water polo by publishing brochures with rules and hints.\nIn the Soviet Union.\nAs previously, water polo was predominant in Moscow and Leningrad (formerly known as St. Petersburg). However, this changed when the water polo teams of the Black Sea Fleet, Baltic Fleet and Caspian Flotilla further spread water polo in Russia. In the early history, water polo was popular especially among sailors. The strongest teams were Delfin of Leningrad and the Moscow Life Saving Society and the Yacht-Club. Following the resolution by the organizing bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1925, physical culture has been greatly propagated in Russia, stimulating water polo as well.\nThe first championship took place in 1925. Apart from the teams of Leningrad, Moscow and Kiev, the tournament featured teams from the Caucasus, Crimea, Ural, as well as the aforementioned fleet teams. Three years later, water polo was included in the All-Union Spartakiade (sports festival). The team of Leningrad dominated in Russian water polo until 1933, as the city had winter water pools and so had more training opportunities. In 1946, the USSR Water Polo Cup was introduced. One year later, the Soviet Union was selected into the FINA. The national water polo then debuted at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Helsinki.\nCurrent squad.\nRoster for the 2020 Men's European Water Polo Championship.\nHead coach: Sergey Yevstigneyev"

The Court itself was then demolished to make way for a new No. 3 court and new Court 4 ready for the 2011 Championships.\nThe \"Graveyard of Champions\" tag was coined as many former champions fell to ignominious defeats on the No. 2 Court, including:\nNew No. 2 court.\nFor the 2009 Championships a new No. 2 court was built on the site of the previous No. 13 court, with a capacity of 4,000. The old No. 2 was briefly renamed No. 3 Court before its subsequent demolition."

He was selected by the Chicago Bears in the third round of the 2002 NFL Draft, 72nd overall. He received a football scholarship to Florida State University. But due to being academically ineligible, he attended Tuskegee University.\nEarly years.\nRoosevelt stayed in the crime-infested housing projects on the East side of Jacksonville, where he and current NFL running back Leon Washington were neighbors. Roosevelt decided to attend Terry Parker High School (Jacksonville, Florida); which is 15 miles from his neighborhood; Williams felt the transition would keep him focus and out of trouble. At Terry Parker High School he lettered in football, basketball and track.\nCollege career.\nAt Tuskegee University he was considered one of the top five cornerbacks in the nation for the NFL draft. He was also arguably considered the best collegiate defender in the state of Alabama in 2002. He played college football at Tuskegee in which he is considered the best cover cornerback to ever wear the crimson and old gold. Williams collegiate success of being drafted from a small division II have paid the way for current and former NFL players Drayton Florence, Frank Walker, Dimitri Patterson and Harry Williams who were drafted in the years after him. Williams made All-American and first team SIAC all of his four years at a historical black university.\nProfessional career.\nChicago Bears.\nWilliams was selected in the third round of the 2002 NFL Draft. The pick used was obtained by the Bears from the Dallas Cowboys. Due to a nagging ankle injury he suffered in training camp, Williams played 7 games in his rookie season starting in three. Week 13 Chicago missed a big opportunity on the last play of the half. Packers QB Brett Favre threw a hail mary pass at the end of the half that was intercepted by Bears SS Damon Moore. Moore fumbled the ball to Packers lineman Mike Wahle, who subsequently fumbled it again to Williams. Packers rookie receiver Javon Walker chased Williams down and tackled him short of the end zone to end the half. Bears CB R. W. McQuarters had a chance to make the block but attempted to position himself for a lateral instead, allowing Walker to make the tackle at the 11-yard line to end the first half. The wild play made headlines in the Chicago daily news, ESPN, and the Pardon the Interruption show when sports columnist Michael Wilbon criticized R. W. McQuarters for such a selfish act that caused Williams not to score. \nWeek 14 Williams made his first start against the AFC champions the New York Jets and was the player of the game that stop the Jets from progressing to the 2002 playoffs.\nDenver Broncos.\nWilliams was claimed off waivers from the Denver Broncos. The Broncos made room for Williams by cutting third-string quarterback Danny Kanell leaving just two quarterbacks on the Broncos roster. Week 3 against the San Diego Chargers starting quarterback Jake Plummer injured his shoulder during a Chargers sack which resulted in the release of Williams to make room for another quarterback. A couple days after the release, Williams was picked up by the Cleveland Browns.\nCleveland Browns.\nWilliams played in a total of 12 games for the Browns starting in 3. With the Browns Williams was on a secondary unit that were ranked #3 in pass defense and #10 in total defense. In week 13 Cleveland Browns faced the Denver Broncos which was considered the game of the week that went in overtime. Williams finished that game with 8 tackles and a couple of break ups.\nCoaching career.\nIn 2019, Williams was appointed the head football coach at ASA College in Hialeah, Florida."

Since the Paris track could accommodate 9 runners, this was a rare case where 9 were advanced to the finals.\nRunning before a home crowd, Girard was marginally first over the first hurdle of the final. She extended the lead over the second hurdle, but by the third, the field had come back. Jenny Adams and Perdita Felicien emerged with the lead. By the fifth hurdle, Felicien was all alone. Glory Alozie, Miesha McKelvy and Brigitte Foster-Hylton had joined Adams in the hunt for silver. By the seventh hurdle, Felicien had a 1-metre lead over McKelvy, slightly ahead of Foster-Hylton. Through the next couple of hurdles, Foster-Hylton got up a head of steam, passing McKelvy and pulling in some of Felicien's lead. Diving for the line early, Foster-Hylton got as close as a foot (30 cm) a couple of metres before the finish, but she was losing balance. Felicien crossed the finish maintaining her speed while Foster-Hylton struggled her last two steps, crashing to the track after the finish.

        "text": "The Seattle Redhawks men's basketball team represents Seattle University in NCAA Division I basketball competition. Established in 1946, the team was previously known as the Seattle Chieftains. The program experienced success during the 1950s and 1960s, reaching the NCAA Division I tournament eleven times. Led by Elgin Baylor (the future 1958 number one draft pick), Seattle finished as the runner-up in the 1958 NCAA University Division basketball tournament.\nSeattle was a member of NCAA Division I from 1946 to 1980 before budget problems led them to reclassify to NAIA in 1980. They eventually rose to NCAA Division II before rejoining the Division I level in 2008. They are a member of the Western Athletic Conference, which they joined in 2012. They were previously a member of the West Coast Conference (1971–1980). The current head coach is Chris Victor, who was previously the associate head coach.\nHistory.\n1950s and 1960s: National prominence.\nEstablished in 1946, the program experienced a period of success during the 1950s and 1960s. Seattle produced more NBA players than any other school from 1960 to 1969. From 1953 to 1969, the Seattle Chieftains reached the NCAA tournament 11 times.\nOn January 21, 1952, the Seattle Chieftains beat the Harlem Globetrotters in a stunning 84–81 upset, led by Johnny O'Brien. Six years later, Elgin Baylor led the Chieftains to the championship game of the 1958 NCAA tournament, but fell to the Kentucky Wildcats at Freedom Hall in Louisville on March 22. Despite finishing runner-up, Baylor was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player and was the first selection of the 1958 NBA draft in April.\nNotable alumni of Seattle University basketball include Elgin Baylor, Johnny O'Brien, Eddie O'Brien, Charlie Brown, Eddie Miles, Clint Richardson, John Tresvant, Tom Workman, Frank Oleynick, Charlie Williams, Jawann Oldham, Charles Garcia, and Plummer Lott.\nThe decline of local businesses such as Boeing (the largest employer in the region) in the late 1970s led to drastic cuts to keep the program steady, which included moving down to NAIA in 1980.\nCameron Dollar (2009–2017).\nSeattle discontinued its men's basketball at the Division I level for some time, initially moving to NAIA in 1980. Seattle rejoined the NCAA as a Division III member and then as a Division II member in 2002; they joined the Great Northwest Athletic Conference that year. In 2007, they won a share of the regular season title with Seattle Pacific. They were then invited to the 2007 NCAA Division II men's basketball tournament, their first tournament appearance as a program in decades.\nIn 2008, the program rejoined the Division I level. In 2009, Cameron Dollar was hired as the new men's basketball head coach to replace Joe Callero. Seattle University and University of Washington agreed to renew their rivalry by playing annually from 2009 to 2017 while rotating sites. In 2017, the two schools played in the 2K Sports Classic.\nThe Redhawks played as an independent for the next three years before seeking a conference. Seattle first applied to the West Coast Conference, where they played between 1971 and 1980, but were turned down. After declining an invitation to the now-defunct Great West Conference, Seattle applied for membership in the Big Sky Conference and Big West Conference but were again turned down. During the 2010–14 NCAA conference realignment, the Western Athletic Conference saw 12 of its members leave. In 2012, the WAC invited Seattle to join and Seattle accepted soon after.\nSeattle began the 2012–13 season in the WAC, and for the 2013–14 season only three members from the prior year remained in the conference (Seattle, New Mexico State, and Idaho). The WAC added six new members for 2013–14, and once Idaho left for the Big Sky Conference in 2014–15, Seattle became the second-longest tenured WAC school after just three seasons in the league.\nSeattle won their first WAC tournament game in the 2014–15 season, beating Chicago State and UMKC en route to the WAC tournament finals where they lost to New Mexico State. The Redhawks finished the regular season 16–15, and earned an invite to the College Basketball Invitational. It was the Redhawks' first appearance in a Division I postseason tournament since 1969. Seattle beat Pepperdine and Colorado in the first two rounds in the Connolly Center, before losing to Loyola (Ill.) in the semi-finals. Loyola (Ill.) would go on to win the tournament. In the 2015–16 season, Seattle was invited to the CBI again and hosted their first two games. After beating Idaho in the first round, the Redhawks fell to Vermont.\nOn March 13, 2017, Cameron Dollar was fired after compiling a 107–138 record and two CBI appearances at Seattle.\nJim Hayford (2017–2021).\nOn March 29, 2017, Jim Hayford was hired as the new men's basketball head coach to replace Dollar, coming from rival Eastern Washington University.\nIn his first year as head coach, Hayford compiled a 20–14 record, the Redhawks' first 20-win season since 2008 and first 20-win season in Division I play since the 1960s. The Redhawks fell to Central Arkansas in the first round of the 2018 CBI tournament. In his second year as head coach, Hayford compiled an 18–15 record, marking the Redhawks' first back-to-back 18+ win seasons since 2008–09 and 2009–10. The Redhawks fell to Presbyterian in the first round of the 2019 CIT tournament.\nHome court.\nSeattle moved to KeyArena, just a few miles from campus, for men's basketball in 2009 when the Redhawks moved to Division I. KeyArena opened on October 26, 1995, and plays host to other sporting events, family events, and other entertainment. Despite seating just over 17,000 people, Seattle curtains off the upper deck and only sells tickets for the lower bowl and luxury boxes, making the official capacity for Redhawks games 8,901. 1,160 of that is luxury boxes.\nSeattle has played a game at the ShoWare Center in Kent, Washington on select years since moving back to D1. The games are referred to as the \"ShoWare Classic\".\nThe Redhawk Center on the campus has been seldom used by the men's team as it only seats 999. Seattle U hosted their College Basketball Invitational games at the Redhawk Center in 2015 because KeyArena was in use for the NCAA men's basketball tournament.\nThe Redhawk Center hosted six Seattle U home games in 2016–2017, and ten the next season (2017–2018). Climate Pledge Arena continues to be considered the program's primary home court; however, it is scheduled to be closed from 2018 to 2021 while being totally rebuilt. Two early-season home games were played at the ShoWare Center in November 2018, but the rest of the 2018–2019 home schedule is being played on campus at the Redhawk Center.\nRivalries.\nSeattle U has two recognized rivals: Washington and Eastern Washington.\nWashington.\nThe two schools are only 2.8 miles apart and have met 33 times. Cameron Dollar came from Washington as an assistant under Lorenzo Romar, which helped restart the rivalry when the Redhawks returned to Division I. The schools first met in 1952, then played every season from 1969 to 1979 when Seattle U left the NCAA. Washington leads the series 29–4.\nThey have played every season since 2009 on a rotating home-court basis.\nEastern Washington.\nSeattle U and Eastern Washington have met 14 times since they first played in 2009. The \"Intrastate Battle\" rivalry game between them is sometimes played twice a season in a rotating home court basis, though sometimes is only played once.\nThe series is currently tied 7–7.\nAn establishing chapter began in 2017 when Jim Hayford left his head coaching position EWU for the same job at Seattle U. Hayford's assistant, Shantay Legans, was hired as his successor. On December 3, 2017, in Hayford's first game against his former team and assistant, Seattle U won 85–64 \nPostseason appearances.\nNCAA Division I tournament.\nThe Redhawks have made the NCAA Division I tournament 11 times. They have not reached the NCAA Division I Tournament since 1969, which is the fifth longest drought between appearances in NCAA Division I Tournament history, although they were not in Division I for 29 years of the drought. The combined record for the Redhawks is 10–13.\nNCAA Division II.\nIn their time in NCAA Division II, Seattle made the tournament once. They had a record of 1–1.\nNIT appearances.\nSeattle has made two appearances in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). They have a combined record of 0–2.\nCBI appearances.\nSeattle has made four appearances in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI). They have a combined record of 7–3.

        "text": "Henry Thomas Day (September 1863 – 12 July 1911) was a Welsh international rugby union forward who played club rugby for Newport and Cardiff. Day was awarded five caps for Wales, and was most notable for being part of the 1893 Welsh Triple Crown winning team. A carpenter by trade, he was also the uncle of Harry Phillips, who was also a Newport player who represented Wales.\nRugby career.\nDay was a strong forward player, noted for the muscle he brought to the pack. This strength was required for his first notable game, played against the 1888 touring New Zealand Māori team, who brought with them a strong physicality which the Newport team found difficult to match. Although only losing by five minors to nil at half time, Newport's defence crumbled in the second half with the Māoris winning by three tries to nil. \nDay had to wait five years from the New Zealand game to win his first cap, but was given his chance when he was called in to fill in for Tom Graham in the final game of the 1892 Home Nations Championship. Day joined a pack that was becoming an established fixture of the Welsh team, and although losing to Ireland, the selectors kept faith in him bringing him back into the squad for the 1893 Championship. Day represented Wales for the first two games of the tournament, a narrow win over England at Cardiff and a more convincing victory over the Scottish away at Raeburn Place. Although Day was replaced by Swansea's David Samuel for the final game, the resulting win over Ireland gave Wales the Championship, and made Day a Triple Crown winner.\nDay played two more international games for Wales, both as part of the 1894 Home Nations Championship. Day missed the opening match away to England, but was chosen as the replacement when Arthur Boucher was forced to withdraw for the game against Scotland. The Welsh team, which contained eight Newport players, beat the Scottish, but lost to Ireland in the final game of the tournament. The next season saw the return of Boucher, and Day did not represent Wales again.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "text": "The RIT Tigers men's ice hockey team is a collegiate ice hockey team representing the Rochester Institute of Technology in suburban Rochester, New York, United States. The school's men's team competes in the Division I Atlantic Hockey conference. The team has won two national championships, one each at the Division II and Division III levels. It lost in the semifinals of the Division I \"Frozen Four\" in 2010.\nHistory.\nFounding, Division II and Division III.\nIn the fall of 1957, RIT student Jack Trickey founded the Monroe County Amateur Hockey (MCAHA) Association. A group of RIT students made up the majority of one of the teams. In 1958, the RIT Hockey Club was founded, and competed in the MCAHA until the league folded in 1960. The RIT hockey team continued to play against junior varsity and club teams. The RIT student council and athletic committee recommended that hockey be added to the athletic program, and men's hockey later became a varsity sport. The 1962-63 season was their first major season, as coached by Jim Heffer. In 1982, under third-year coach Brian Mason, they had their first twenty-win season with 23 wins to only nine losses. The team competed at the Division II and III level for several years. The Tigers won the NCAA Division II men's ice hockey tournament in 1983. In April of 1984, Mason left the program to coach at Dartmouth. He was replaced by Bruce Delventhal. The 1985-86 team won 31 games and then won the NCAA Division III men's ice hockey tournament by a score of 5–1 over Bemidji State. While the Tigers made the Frozen Four four times from 1984 to 1989, they did not reach the D-III Tournament again until 1994 with Eric Hoffberg as coach. When he left after the 1999 season, he had taken the Tigers to the tournament five times and reached the Frozen Four twice. In 2004, it was announced that the Tigers would move up to the NCAA Division I level for the 2005-2006 season.\nNCAA Division I.\nIn their first year (2005–2006) in the Atlantic Hockey Association, the Tigers went 6-22-2. In their second season, they won the regular-season title with 21 wins.. They were ineligible to compete in the playoffs until the 2007–2008 season. In the 2007–2008 season, the Tigers played in the Mariucci Classic in which they stunned the number-12-ranked Minnesota Golden Gophers by a score of 4–3. However, they fell to number-14-ranked Boston College 6–0. During the playoffs, they swept Holy Cross but were shut out in the first round of the AHA Tournament 5–0 by the Air Force Falcons, who were without their Hobey Baker finalist Eric Ehn. In the 2008–2009 season, the Tigers played some of their best regular-season hockey (notably an 11-game win streak from December 6 to January 25). They met Holy Cross again in the playoffs and won the series 2–1 but fell in the AHA Tournament to the Mercyhurst Lakers 5–4 in overtime. Highlights of the game include Mercyhurst overcoming a 3–1 deficit and the Tigers tying the game with under a minute left. In the 2009–10 season, their most successful season to date, the Tigers made a historic run all the way to the 2010 NCAA Frozen Four, sweeping Connecticut in the first round and winning the AHA Tournament by beating the Canisius Golden Griffins as well as the Sacred Heart Pioneers to advance to the NCAA tournament as the conference's autobid. The Tigers stunned the Denver Pioneers 2–1 and then finished off the University of New Hampshire Wildcats 6–2 in the east regional in Albany, New York, where they advanced to the Frozen Four. The team's run came to an end in the national semifinals, where they fell to the University of Wisconsin Badgers, 8–1.\nIn the 2010–2011 season, the Tigers played in the Maverick stampede but lost both their games against number-4-ranked St. Cloud State and the University of Nebraska–Omaha. The Tigers won yet another regular season title and made it all the way to the AHA championship game, where they fell to the Air Force Falcons by a score of 1–0. Air Force goaltender Jason Torf made 40 saves in the contest. In the 2011–2012 season, the Tigers struggled early on, but bounced back in the second half of the season, eliminating the Bentley Falcons after falling behind 1–0 in the first round series of the Atlantic Hockey playoffs, but prevailing in their next two games. They advanced again to the AHA championship game where they eliminated Niagara in overtime but fell, yet again, to the Air Force Falcons, getting shut out 4–0. The Tigers struggled over the next two seasons, as they finished 2012–2013 with a record of 15–18–5, their first losing record since joining Atlantic Hockey. This was also the first time they were unable to advance to the Atlantic Hockey semifinals at Blue Cross Arena, as they defeated American International College in the first round, but were swept by the Niagara Purple Eagles in the second round, losing in overtime in the second game. The following year (2013–2014), the Tigers played their final season at their home ice rink, Frank Ritter Memorial Ice Arena. The Tigers only won 6 out of 16 games at their home arena. Although they struggled that season, the Tigers participated in the \"Frozen Frontier,\" a 10-day hockey festival at Rochester's Frontier Field outdoor baseball stadium. The Tigers took on their AHA rivals, the Niagara University Purple Eagles on December 14. The teams skated to a 2–2 tie in a snow storm and 16-degree temperatures. In their final game at Ritter Arena, the Tigers defeated their long time AHA rival, the Canisius College Golden Griffins 3–1. In the playoffs, the Tigers won the first game in overtime against Holy Cross before getting blown away in game two by a score of 5–1. In the deciding game, The Tigers led 2–0 but Holy Cross came from behind to tie the game in the second period, forcing overtime where they completed the comeback.\nThe Tigers moved into the 4,300-seat Gene Polisseni Center for the 2014–15 season. Their first season in the Polisseni Center saw the Tigers finish with a 20–15–5 overall record. They played in the Mariucci classic, losing both games against number-9-ranked Massachusetts–Lowell and number-8-ranked Minnesota. In the playoffs, they swept the Air Force Falcons in the second round after receiving a bye in the first round. The Tigers went on to defeat Canisius in the semifinals of the AHA Tournament by a score of 2–1 and the Meryhurst Lakers in the championship game by a score of 5–1 to win the Atlantic Hockey championship and advance to the NCAA Division I tournament for the second time in program history. The Tigers knocked off the Minnesota State Mavericks in the first round of the NCAA tournament 2–1, becoming the first #16 seed to defeat the top overall seed since the 16-team format was implemented in 2003. There would be no repeat, however, of the 2009–2010 run to the Frozen Four as the Tigers fell to the University of Nebraska Omaha Mavericks in the following round by a score of 4–0, ending their playoff run. In the 2015–16 season, the Tigers lost home ice in the first round to Mercyhurst as they were swept in their last two games of the regular season on home ice; however, the Tigers returned the favor in the postseason by sweeping the Lakers on the road. The Tigers once again were in the AHA tournament and faced the Air Force Falcons once again. The Tigers trailed 1–0 heading into the third and it would appear that they were headed to another shutout loss, but Andrew Miller scored with under 3 minutes left in the third to even the score. In overtime, the Tigers completed their comeback winning 2–1. The Tigers would then claim the Atlantic Hockey championship once again, convincingly defeating the Robert Morris Colonials by a score of 7–4, to advance to the NCAA Division 1 tournament for the second consecutive season. The team's playoff run ended in the first round of the east regional in Albany, New York by the first-ranked Quinnipiac Bobcats by a score of 4–0. The 2016–2017 season was a down year for the Tigers as they flirted with the .500 mark within their conference and were unable to defeat any non-conference teams. They faced Niagara in the first round of the playoffs losing a close one 5–4 in game 1 but shutting them out 5–0 in game 2 setting the stage for the deciding game 3. They were unable to complete the comeback as the Purple Eagles ended the Tigers' season winning 4–1.\nIn the 2017–2018 season, the Tigers started the season with their first game at Blue Cross Arena for Brick City weekend against the number-14th-ranked Northeastern University. It was the first meeting between these two schools. RIT jumped out to a 3–0 lead only to see Northeastern comeback and tie it. The Tigers performed well during the first half of the season but slumped during the second half. The Tigers finished with an overall record of 14–18–2 and a 13–14–1 for 27 points within their conference. Junior Erik Brown set a new school record with 28 goals during the season (including exhibition games) and also led the entire Atlantic Hockey Conference. His 28 goals was also 2nd overall in Division I hockey. In the playoffs, the Tigers faced the Sacred Heart Pioneers. Both teams split the first two games with both games heading to overtime. The Tigers prevailed in Game 1 scoring quickly in overtime to take a 1–0 series lead. The Pioneers prevailed in Game 2 after tying the game late in the third and finally ending it during triple overtime (the longest game in program history). In the deciding game, the Pioneers jumped out to a 2–0 lead early in the first and held the fort the rest of the way to clinch the series concluding the Tigers' season.\nThe Tigers finished the 2018–2019 with a record (17–17–4) and played the Arizona State Sun Devils for the first time. Despite the Sun Devils recently moving into Division 1, the Tigers got swept on home ice. In the playoffs, they faced Sacred Heart. They split the first two games with lopsided results (9–4 loss in Game 1 and a 7–3 win in Game 2) before edging them out in Game 3 with a 3–1 victory. The Tigers would then face the Niagara Purple Eagles in the next round. The game was intense with the goalies stealing the show. After regulation ended with no goals the game was decided in overtime where Niagara scored 7:03 into extra time to win 1–0.\nThe 2019–2020 season saw the Tigers play in the Icebreaker tournament in Ohio with a pair of games against Coach Wayne Wilson's and Associate Head Coach Brian Hills' Alma mater, the Bowling Green State Falcons as well as the Ohio State University Buckeyes. RIT prevailed against the Falcons in overtime (3–2) but fell to the Buckeyes (3–1). The Tigers had their ups and downs during the season but play was disrupted throughout the league when the COVID 19 pandemic cancelled the playoffs.\nDuring the off-season, the school was debating whether or not to hold a season for the 2020–2021 season. On November 10, 2020, the school decided to cancel the season due to the pandemic. This prompted the team to issue a statement on Twitter showing an inconsistency (RIT plans to have a 12% increase in in-person learning next semester) as well as the fact that the season was to start in between semesters creating a comfortable bubble. Seven days later, the school reconsidered and declared that the season was set to move forward. The season got underway November 27 against Clarkson with RIT coming out victorious 8–5 in front of zero fans. This season also marked the debut of the Long Island University Sharks which RIT hosted and split the series. RIT finished the abridged season with a record of 9–9–2 and made an early exit from the playoffs getting swept by Canisius.\nThe Tigers finished 2021–22 season in fourth place in the AHA, followed by a 2–1 series victory in the quarterfinals at home against Sacred Heart. The Tigers lost their semifinals matchup against Air Force in Utica.\nThe 2022–23 season saw the Tigers win their first Atlantic Hockey Association Regular season Championship since the 2010–11 season. The Tigers began the year strong, with highlights including their 8–5 defeat of Union during the Brick City Homecoming Game (also the team's first victory over the Dutchmen), and an 8-game win streak. As a result of their strong play, the Tigers found themselves nationally ranked in both the USCHO Poll and the USA Today Hockey Poll (peaking at #18 in both). However, the end of the regular season saw the Tigers slide, dropping out of the USCHO and USA Today rankings and winning only 4 of their final 9 contests. Despite this, the Tigers finished with a record of 22–11–1 (18–7–1 in conference play), their most wins since their 2009–10 season, and clinched the first seed in the Atlantic Hockey playoffs. The Tigers swept the eighth seed Mercyhurst Lakers in the Atlantic Hockey Quarterfinals best-of-three series, but were upset in the Semifinals by the seventh seed Holy Cross Crusaders, losing that series 2-1. Four of the six members of the season's Atlantic Hockey's All-Conference First Team were RIT Tigers; foreward Carter Wilke, defensemen Gianfranco Cassaro and Aiden Hansen-Bukata, and goaltender Tommy Scarfone.\nThe Tigers opened their 2023-24 season with a loss at St. Lawrence, but rebounded with a 3–0 win over Notre Dame in the Brick City Homecoming Game a week later, and opened Atlantic Hockey play with a 4–2 home victory over Sacred Heart. Junior goaltender Tommy Scarfone was named the Atlantic Hockey Goaltender of the Month for the month of October, as RIT earned a spot in the USCHO rankings at #20 after the first weekend of November. The Tigers would remain in the rankings, moving as high as #18 as they entered the mid-season break. Returning from the break, RIT participated in the Dartmouth Ledyard Classic tournament hosted by Dartmouth University, splitting the two games they played. With a 3–0 victory against Bentley on January 26, Scarfone earned his 44th win for the Tigers, becoming the leader in goaltender wins for RIT since the program moved up to Division I. The Tigers clinched a first round bye in the Atlantic Hockey Tournament after beating Air Force on February 16, and first place in the AHA season following a defeat of second place Holy Cross by Bentley on February 22. This regular season championship was the Tigers' second in a row and RIT's sixth since joining the conference. RIT proceeded to sweep both the conference quarterfinals against Robert Morris and semifinals against Niagara, and subsequently defeated AIC 5–2 in the Atlantic Hockey Championship Game to earn their first NCAA tournament appearance since 2016. As with the previous season, four Tigers were named to the AHA All-Conference First Team: Willie, Cassaro, and Scarfone each for the second consecutive season, in addition to foreward Cody Laskosky. Scarfone and head coach Wayne Wilson were named as the conference's goaltender and coach of the year, respectively.\nBrick City Homecoming game results.\nThe Brick City Homecoming game is RIT's annual homecoming game that takes place at the Blue Cross Arena in downtown Rochester.

        "title": "2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game",
        "text": "The 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 82nd in-season exhibition game between the All-Stars of the National League (NL) and the American League (AL); the leagues composing Major League Baseball. The event was held on Tuesday, July 12, 2011 at Chase Field in Phoenix, Arizona, home of the National League Arizona Diamondbacks. The game ended in a 5–1 win for the National League, their second straight All-Star victory. It was the first MLB All-Star Game to be held in Arizona and the first in a National League Park to have a designated hitter.\nWith a combination of injuries and rule enforcements, a record 84 players were named to the All-Star rosters. This broke the record of 82 players that were on rosters for the 2010 game.\nBackground.\nAs with each All-Star Game since 1970, the nine starting position players of each league were elected by fan balloting. The remaining players were selected by a players' vote, each league's team manager, and a second fan balloting to add one more player to each roster. In all, 32 players were selected to each league's team, not including players who decline to play due to injuries or personal reasons.\nDiamondbacks manager Bob Melvin confirmed on April 10, 2009, that Arizona would host the 2011 All-Star Game and it was officially announced by Commissioner Bud Selig the next day. Phoenix had never hosted the All-Star Game before; the last first-time host city was Denver, Colorado in 1998. The game was the ninth straight All-Star Game to decide home-field advantage in the World Series. Prior All-Star games had only used the designated hitter (DH) rule when in American League parks. However, the 2011 game was the first to feature a DH in a NL park following a rules change in 2010. The NL came into the game having won the previous year's match, their first victory since 1996.\nImmigration controversy.\nSome, such as New York Congressman José Serrano and sportswriter Mike Lupica, had suggested that Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig should move the game because of the controversial SB1070 anti-illegal immigration bill passed by the Arizona legislature and signed into law by Governor Jan Brewer. Others considered asking club owners, sponsors and even players to boycott the All-Star Game if the law was implemented and the game remained in Phoenix. However, Selig announced on May 13, 2010, that the game would remain at Chase Field in Phoenix as planned.\nFan balloting.\nStarters.\nBalloting for the 2011 All-Star Game starters began online April 26 and continued through June 30. Fan voting also took place in each MLB stadium, beginning May 10 (at the latest) and ending on June 24. The top vote-getters at each position and the top three among outfielders, were named the starters for their respective leagues. The results were announced on July 3. A record 32.5 million votes were cast, beating out the previous record from 2009 by roughly 9 million. José Bautista was the leading vote-getter with 7,454,753 votes, easily breaking the previous single-player vote record of 6,069,688 held by Ken Griffey Jr. Three other American League players also topped Griffey's record. Ryan Braun was the National League's leading vote getter, receiving a NL record 5,928,004 votes.\nFinal roster spot.\nAfter the rosters were revealed, a second ballot of five players per league was created for the All-Star Final Vote to determine the 34th and final player of each roster, with online balloting conducted from Sunday afternoon, July 3, through Thursday afternoon, July 7. The winners of the final vote were Paul Konerko of the Chicago White Sox (AL) and Shane Victorino of the Philadelphia Phillies. Victorino became the first ever two-time Final Vote winner, having also won in 2009.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nGame summary.\nBox Score.\nUMPIRES: Home Plate – Dale Scott; First Base – Jerry Layne; Second Base – Hunter Wendelstedt; Third Base – Dan Iassogna; Left Field – Ed Hickox; Right Field – Chris Guccione \nWeather: Indoors \nTime of Game: 2:50 Attendance: 47,994\nThe American League struck first on Adrián González's two-out home run in the fourth off of Cliff Lee, who allowed two singles. Tyler Clippard in relief allowed a single to Adrian Beltre, but José Bautista was tagged out at home to end the inning. In the bottom half, after two leadoff singles, Prince Fielder's three-run home run off of C. J. Wilson put the National League up 3–1. Next inning, Rickie Weeks reached first on a fielder's choice, stole second and scored on Andre Ethier's single off of Jordan Walden. The National League added another run in the seventh when Hunter Pence hit a leadoff single, moved to third on Brandon League's passed ball and scored on Pablo Sandoval's ground-rule double and went on to win the game 5–1."

The club's best performance to date was finishing 6th in the top division. In 1996 they were relegated to Division 2 but succeeded in gaining promotion back to Division 1 the following season. The club now plays in the newly extended West Sussex Invitation Cricket League.\nOne of the most notable points in the club's history was their reluctance to permit people who lived or worked outside the village to become a member. This policy had little effect on their success however as they finished runners-up in the Sussex Championship League in 1981, won the Worthing &amp; District KO in 1974, and finished runners-up in the same competition in 1975 and 1982. The second team also enjoyed good success winning the Clymping KO in 1969, 1972 and 1973 and the Clymping Plate in 1981, 1989 and 1996.\nOver the years the club has enjoyed connections with some famous cricketers. Garfield Sobers and Tony Greig have made appearances in charity games and Sussex cricketer Ken Suttle played for the club for several seasons in the 1990s.\nThe club plays its home games on its small ground situated at the heart of the village. The size of the ground has caused issues with several neighbours over the years."

This season represented the 100th season of basketball in the school's history.\nThe Tar Heels finished the season 20–17, 5–11 in ACC play and lost in the first round of the 2010 ACC men's basketball tournament. They received an invitation to the 2010 National Invitation Tournament where they advanced to the championship game before falling to Dayton.\nPreseason.\nThe Tar Heels lost four starters from their 2008–09 Championship team and top backcourt reserve Bobby Frasor. Tyler Hansbrough, the Atlantic Coast Conference all-time leading scorer, was selected in the lottery of the 2009 NBA draft, going #13 to the Indiana Pacers. ACC Player of the Year Ty Lawson and 2009 NCAA tournament Most Outstanding Player Wayne Ellington also were drafted in the first round, by the Denver Nuggets and Minnesota Timberwolves respectively. Senior swingman Danny Green would also get drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the second round.\nTop returnees are senior center Deon Thompson, who spent the Summer helping lead Team USA to a bronze at the World University Games and sophomore Ed Davis, who had got projected as a first-round draft pick. Reserve sophomores Larry Drew II and Tyler Zeller also return, and junior swingman Will Graves was reinstated over the Summer after a mid-season suspension by coach Roy Williams. Also returning is defensive stopper Marcus Ginyard, who took a medical redshirt for the 2008–09 campaign after starting as a junior for the 2007–08 Tar Heel team, who advanced to the Final Four. Joining the returnees is a recruiting class containing four McDonald's All-Americans and ranked as one of the top 5 in the Nation.\nDespite the heavy losses for the defending champions, the Tar Heels were ranked in the top ten of both preseason polls when they got released on October 29, Even garnering a single vote for #1 in both the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll. UNC was ranked #6 in the AP and #4 in the Coaches poll. The Tar Heels were also picked as the ACC pre-season favorite (with rival Duke) by the conference media, while Davis was chosen a member of the preseason All-ACC Team.\nOther preseason honors for Tar Heel players included the inclusion of Davis and Thompson on the 50-man Wooden Award preseason candidate list, while Davis was also one of the 50 players named to the Naismith watch list. Marcus Ginyard was named a preseason candidate for the Lowe's Senior CLASS Award, one of only two ACC players named to the 30-man list (with Duke's Jon Scheyer).\n100th anniversary celebration.\nUNC kicked off their 100th season with an alumni game on September 4, featuring such NBA players as Vince Carter, Antawn Jamison and Marvin Williams. At halftime of the event, the 2009 National Championship banner got unveiled, and UNC legend Michael Jordan got honored for his election to the Basketball Hall of Fame. The event also proved to be an excellent recruiting tool for UNC, as 2011 forward prospect James McAdoo committed to North Carolina at the event and Harrison Barnes, the 2010 #1 recruit in the ESPNU and Scout.com rankings, would later commit to UNC after attending the event. Members of the 2009 championship team received their championship rings at halftime of the UNC-Citadel football game on September 5.\nIn their season opener against Florida International, the Tar Heels donned throwback uniforms in the style of the 1957 undefeated national championship team – with distinctive red trim. The Tar Heels wore the 1957 throwback uniforms again when they played Rutgers on December 28.\nRecruiting.\nCoach Roy Williams signed a five-person class for 2009, including two-time Tennessee Division II-AA Mr. Basketball Leslie McDonald from Memphis, identical twins David and Travis Wear from California, and athletic combo guard Dexter Strickland from New Jersey. But the crown jewel of the class was 6'10 forward John Henson of Tampa, Florida, rated the #1 PF by Scout.com. Henson, Strickland and the Wear twins were all named to the McDonald's game in Miami. Henson and Strickland were also named first-team Parade All-Americans, while McDonald and the Wears were called to the fourth team by the magazine.\nSeason.\nNon-conference season.\nUNC kicked off their non-conference schedule on November 9 against Florida International and new coach Isiah Thomas as a part of the Coaches Vs. Cancer Classic, defeating the Golden Panthers 88–72 at the Dean Smith Center. There had been some controversy surrounding the game as FIU had threatened to pull out of the tournament when the brackets were released, and they found that they were not scheduled to play Ohio State as they had initially planned.\nAfter home wins over North Carolina Central and Valparaiso, the Tar Heels began a tough out of conference slate which would include five teams ranked in the preseason Coaches' poll. First was a trip to Madison Square Garden for the finals of the Coaches Vs. Cancer Classic. After defeating #15 Ohio State 77–73 in their semifinal game, the Tar Heels lost the championship game 87–71 to #24 Syracuse. UNC had a two-point lead at the half, but the Orange used a 25–3 run coming out of the locker room to defeat the young Tar Heels convincingly behind 25 points from forwarding Wesley Johnson.\nIn a 93–72 home win over Gardner-Webb on November 23, 2009, senior Deon Thompson became the 63rd player in UNC history to score 1000 points. The milestone capped a 22-point, 10-rebound performance from Thompson. The game also featured a record-setting night as Gardner-Webb guard Grayson Flittner tied a Dean Smith Center record with nine three-pointers. In their next game it was Roy Williams' turn to achieve a milestone as he won his 600th game in the Tar Heels' 80–73 win over Nevada.\nNext up was #9 Michigan State in Chapel Hill as a part of the ACC – Big Ten Challenge. In this rematch of the 2009 NCAA title game, again beat the Spartans 89–82 behind Ed Davis' 22 points and Larry Drew II's 18 points and six assists. The next game got no more comfortable, as UNC traveled to Rupp Arena to face the #5 Kentucky Wildcats. The Tar Heels fell behind early as UK freshman John Wall sparked a 28–2 first-half run that punctuated a 15-point halftime deficit. The Tar Heels battled back to make the game close in the second half, but ultimately lost 68–66.\nFollowing the Kentucky game, UNC defeated Presbyterian 103–64 at the Smith Center before traveling to Cowboys Stadium in Dallas to take on the #2 ranked Texas Longhorns in the first basketball game played at that venue. The Longhorns defeated the Tar Heels 103–90 behind Damion James' 25 points and 15 rebounds. Ed Davis had 21 points and nine rebounds in the loss. The Tar Heels rebounded with home wins over Marshall (98–61) and Rutgers (81–67). The Carolina front line of Davis, Thompson, Graves, and Zeller combined for 64 points and 30 rebounds in the win over Marshall, while freshman Dexter Strickland notched 18 in the win over Rutgers in the absence of Marcus Ginyard, who sat out the game with an ankle sprain.\nGinyard also missed the last two non-conference games. In a home contest against Albany, UNC also lost junior forward Will Graves to an ankle injury. The Tar Heels won the game 87–70 but would lose both Graves and reserve Justin Watts for their last non-conference game at the College of Charleston. The Tar Heels played a real road game at Carolina First Arena down two starters. Charleston's Cougars played the Heels shot for shot, sending the game into overtime with an Andrew Goudelock three-pointer. In overtime, the Cougars outscored the Tar Heels to take the game 82–79 in a big upset. Ed Davis had 19 points, 16 rebounds and five blocks in the losing effort.\nConference season.\nThe Tar Heels entered conference play by hosting the Virginia Tech Hokies. The Tar Heels returned injured starters, Will Graves and Marcus Ginyard, while the Hokies welcomed back their star Malcolm Delaney. Delaney lived up to his preseason All-ACC billing, scoring 20 points in the first half as Virginia Tech led 38–34 at the intermission. But Larry Drew II, Will Graves and Ed Davis led a strong second half effort to lead the Tar Heels to a 78–64 win.\nThe next three games were not as positive for the Tar Heels. The Heels were beaten convincingly by Clemson 83–64 in a game that saw UNC commit 26 turnovers. The Tar Heels showed signs of life in their next match against Georgia Tech. After trailing the Yellow Jackets by as much as 20, UNC came storming back to take the lead with under a minute to play, behind Will Graves' 24 points. However, Georgia Tech scored the last three aspects of the game to get the win. The Tar Heels looked to get back to their winning ways against Wake Forest at home but were outscored in both halves, losing 82–69. It marked the first time Roy Williams had lost three games in a row as Tar Heels head coach. The loss knocked the Tar Heels out of the national rankings for the first time since 2006.\nUnfortunately, the Tar Heels were never really able to achieve any real consistency for the remainder of the season, going only 4–8 for the rest of the way. While they did manage to sweep rival North Carolina State, they were swept by Duke, including an 82–50 flogging to close the season. They ultimately finished 5–11 in conference play—only the fourth losing ACC record UNC has ever suffered, and easily the worst conference record in Williams' 22 years as a head coach. They also finished tied for ninth in the conference standings, only their third-ever finish below fourth in ACC play.\nThe Tar Heels briefly showed signs of life in the first half of the ACC tournament against Georgia Tech gaining an early lead, but a second-half swoon resulted in a 62–58 loss.\nPostseason.\nThe Tar Heels got left out of the 2010 NCAA Tournament, becoming the first defending national champion since Florida's 2007–08 unit to not make the next year's tournament while eligible to compete. They were, however, selected for the 2010 National Invitation Tournament. Their first appearance in that tourney since 2003. Despite a 16–16 record, the Tar Heels were a #4 seed, allowing them to host a first-round game against William &amp; Mary. The game was played in the Tar Heels' former home, Carmichael Arena, due to renovations at the Smith Center. After defeating William &amp; Mary, the Tar Heels won road games at Mississippi State and UAB and advanced to the tournament's semi-finals in Madison Square Garden where they defeated Rhode Island in overtime. In the NIT championship game, they lost to Dayton 79–68 to close the season at 20–17. The 17 losses are the second-most in school history.\nOn April 1, Deon Thompson appeared in the NIT Championship game, giving him 152 career game appearances. This set the NCAA all-time career games played mark, formerly held by Wayne Turner of Kentucky and Walter Hodge of Florida.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9| Exhibition\n!colspan=9| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9| ACC Regular Season\n!colspan=9| ACC tournament\n!colspan=9| National Invitation Tournament"

        "text": "Daniel Griffiths (20 June 1857 – 29 October 1936) was a Welsh international rugby union forward who played club rugby for Llanelli and international rugby for Wales. Morgan was a collier by profession.\nRugby career.\nGriffiths came to note as a rugby player when playing for club team Llanelli. In 1888 Griffiths twice faced the 1888 touring New Zealand Natives, once with Llanelli and then three days later with Wales. The Llanelli game against the Māoris was the first time a touring Southern Hemisphere team had played a rugby match in Wales, and a crowd of 3,000 turned up at Stradey Park to watch. Griffiths finished on the winning team, when Harry Bowen scored the only points of the game with a dropped goal from near the halfway line. On the 22 December, Griffiths won his first international cap when he was chosen to face the New Zealand team again, this time against Wales at St. Helen's in Swansea. The game began badly, when the crowd began booing their own team, mainly from Swansea and Llanelli fans who thought their clubs had been overlooked with only two Swansea players on the pitch and Griffiths being the only representative of the 'Scarlets'. Even with a hostile crowd Wales played well, using the four threequarter system, which was adopted by the team after the game, to good effect. The Welsh won by a goal and two tries to nil.\nGriffiths lost his place for the next international, the opener of the 1889 Home Nations Championship to Scotland, but was back in the team for the second and final game of the tournament at home to Ireland. Four Llanelli players were brought into the team, Griffiths, Giotto Griffiths, Ned Roberts and Tom Morgan, which would later turn out to be all four's final international. Wales were led by Arthur Gould, who with nine caps was the most experienced player in both teams; but could not find the play to beat a useful Irish team. The Irish won by two tries to nil and Griffiths ended his international career with a loss.\nInternational matches played.\nWales (rugby union)"

        "text": "Tina Alexandria Charles (born December 5, 1988) is an American professional basketball player for the Atlanta Dream of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). Originally from Jamaica, Queens, New York City, Charles was drafted first overall in the 2010 WNBA draft by the Connecticut Sun. In 2009 and 2010, she and teammate Maya Moore led the Connecticut Huskies to two undefeated national championships. She has won three Olympic gold medals with Team USA.\nCharles is considered by many to be the best player in WNBA history not to have appeared in the Finals.\nHigh school.\nCharles played basketball at Christ the King High School in Middle Village, New York. After averaging 26.5 points, 14.8 rebounds and 5.2 blocked shots per game her senior year, she was named WBCA National Player of the Year, \"Miss Basketball\" for New York state, and was selected as a McDonald's All-American and tabbed New York City Player of the Year by Newsday, the Daily News and the New York Post. Charles was the leading scorer on the Christ the King team that won 57 consecutive games, leading to a USA Today #1 ranking in the country after an undefeated season in 2006. Charles was named a WBCA All-American. She participated in the 2006 WBCA High School All-America Game, where she scored fifteen points and had twelve rebounds.\nCharles was named the MVP of the Red team. During high school, Charles also played on the AAU club basketball team the New York Gazelles.\nCollege.\nIn 2009, Charles led the UConn Huskies to a national title as a junior. She was named Final Four MOP and one of the 10 players on the State Farm All-America team during Final Four weekend.\nCharles made a comment to ESPN during a post-championship interview, in regards to the tradition of sports champions who visit the White House after their title game victories. She said, \"Barack Obama, we will be here soon!\" and after the 2010 championship she made a comment, \"President Barack Obama, we're back!\"\nOn February 13, 2010, before the game vs. St. John's, Charles became the 12th UConn Women's basketball player to be recognized in the Huskies of Honor and was the 2nd player to be honored while still a player. The first was Renee Montgomery the year before.\nOn March 1, 2010, during a game against Notre Dame, Charles broke two UConn records on the same night. Her fifth rebound made her the all-time leading rebounder at UConn, surpassing Rebecca Lobo's fifteen-year-old record of 1268. Lobo was present working as a commentator for ESPN, and interviewed Charles after the game. Additionally, Charles started the night in third place in career scoring, behind Kerry Bascom and Nykesha Sales. Sales had scored 2,178 points and Bascom 2,177 in their careers. During the game, Charles surpassed both to become the leading scorer in UConn history.\nCharles was named the Big East Conference Player of the Year for 2010.\nCharles majored in psychology with a minor in criminal justice. She anticipates working in corrections at the close of her basketball career. In 2010, she spent six hours a week as an intern at Bergin Correctional Institution, helping prisoners adjust back to life in society.\nWNBA.\nConnecticut Sun.\nCharles was the overall #1 pick in the 2010 WNBA draft, selected by the Connecticut Sun.\nCharles was named the 2010 WNBA Rookie of the Year. In her first season, she set all-time league records for rebounds, with 398 (a record that has since been broken by Jonquel Jones in 2017), and double-doubles with 22. (both scoring and rebounds in double digits).\nOn September 2, 2011, Tina Charles had 10 points, 10 assists and 16 rebounds for the first triple-double in Connecticut Sun history, and only the fifth such accomplishment in WNBA history. Charles had eight assists at halftime, and was taken out of the game with nine, because the lead over the opponent was so large. The coach did put her back in the game in the fourth quarter, and she earned an assist on a pass to Jessica Moore, leading to the triple double. However, subsequent review by the league resulted in a change, as three of the assists should not have been credited to Charles, so she ended the game with seven assists, not ten.\nOn August 18, 2012, Charles recorded nine rebounds in an 85–74 win over the Liberty. One of the rebounds in the second quarter pushed her career total to 1,000. She accomplished this milestone faster than any other WNBA player in history. She reached 1,000 rebounds in her 89th game, surpassing the record formerly held by Yolanda Griffith, who reached 1,000 rebounds in her 92nd game.\nCharles was named the 2012 MVP of the WNBA, winning 25 of 41 first place votes. She led the league in the number of double-doubles recorded, and set the mark for the fastest player in WNBA history to reach 900, 1,000 and 1,100 rebounds.\nNew York Liberty.\nIn the weeks leading up to the 2014 WNBA draft, rumors had circulated that Charles could be traded before the draft, so the Sun could obtain more draft picks. Just before the Draft, Charles was traded to her native team the New York Liberty in exchange for Kelsey Bone, the fourth overall pick in the 2014 WNBA draft (Alyssa Thomas) and the fourth overall pick in the 2015 WNBA draft (Elizabeth Williams).\nIn 2016, Charles had the best season of her career, averaging a career-high 21.5 points per game while shooting 43.9% from the field and 81.2% from the free-throw line. Charles had also led the league in rebounds with 9.9 rebounds per game, winning her fourth rebounding title. Her scoring average was tied with Elena Delle Donne but led the league in total points scored which allowed her to claim the scoring title. The Liberty finished with a 21–13 record. With the WNBA's new playoff format in effect, the Liberty were the number 3 seed in the league with a bye to the second round with one elimination game to play where they were defeated by the Phoenix Mercury.\nIn 2017, Charles would be voted into the 2017 WNBA All-Star Game making it her fifth career all-star game appearance. On June 2, 2017, Charles scored a career-high 36 points in a 93–89 win over the Dallas Wings. The Liberty would once again finish with number 3 seed in the league, receiving a bye to the second round elimination game. The Liberty would lose yet again in the second round by a final score of 82–69 to the Washington Mystics.\nIn 2018, Charles re-signed with the Liberty. In 2018, Charles would be voted into the 2018 WNBA All-Star Game for her sixth all-star game appearance.

Charles was medically excused for the shortened 2020 season on July 17, 2020, due to her condition with extrinsic asthma, which impacts her immune system and put her at risk in the coronavirus pandemic.\nSince 2013, Charles has donated her full WNBA salary to the charity she started, Hopey's Heart Foundation. In 2020, Charles announced she would direct that year's salary to support the Black Lives Matter movement. After two seasons with the Mystics - one sitting out in 2020 - Charles and the Mystics did not re-sign with each other during the 2022 offseason.\nPhoenix Mercury.\nOn February 4, 2022, Charles signed with the Phoenix Mercury. Charles joined the Mercury in hopes of winning a title, but the team struggled and wasn't in title contention through the first 18 games of the 2022 season. On June 25, 2022, Charles and the Mercury agreed to a buyout from her contract - officially ending her time in Phoenix. Charles appeared in 16 games for the Mercury and averaged 17.3 points.\nSeattle Storm.\nCharles signed with the Seattle Storm on June 28, 2022.\nOverseas.\nIn the 2011–12 off-season, Charles played in Turkey for Galatasaray.

The event was held in July 2006, when the USA team defeated Canada to win the championship. Charles helped set the tone in the opening game against Paraguay, recording a double-double with 20 points and 10 rebounds. In the gold medal game, she had her second double-double of the tournament with 13 points and 13 rebounds. She was the leading scorer on her team with 12 points per games, as well as the leading rebounder, with 9.5 per game.\nCharles was invited to the USA Basketball Women's National Team training camp in the fall of 2009, one of only three college players invited to the training camp. The team selected to play for the 2010 FIBA World Championship and the 2012 Olympics is usually chosen from these participants.\nCharles was named a member of the team representing the US at the 2009 World University Games held in Belgrade, Serbia. The team won all seven games to earn the gold medal. Charles was the team's leading scorer and rebounder, with 16.1 points per game and 8.1 rebounds per game. In the gold medal game against previously undefeated Russia, she had 28 points and 18 rebounds.\nOn October 5, 2009, Charles was selected to be one of the USA National Team members to travel to the 2009 Ekaterinburg International Invitational.

This game replaces the normal WNBA All-Star game with WNBA All-Stars versus USA Basketball, as part of the preparation for the FIBA World Championship for Women to be held in the Czech Republic during September and October 2010.\nCharles was selected to be a member of the National team representing the US at the World Championships held in September and October 2010. The team was coached by Geno Auriemma. Because many team members were still playing in the WNBA until just prior to the event, the team had only one day of practice with the entire team before leaving for Ostrava and Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic. Even with limited practice, the team managed to win its first games against Greece by 26 points. The team continued to dominate with victory margins exceeding 20 points in the first five games. Several players shared scoring honors, with Swin Cash, Angel McCoughtry, Maya Moore, Diana Taurasi, Lindsay Whalen, and Sylvia Fowles all ending as high scorer in the first few games. The sixth game was against undefeated Australia — the USA jumped out to a 24-point lead and the USA prevailed 83–75. The USA won its next two games by over 30 points, then faced the host team, the Czech Republic, in the championship game. The USA team had only a five-point lead at halftime, which was cut to three points, but the Czechs never got closer. Team USA went on to win the championship and gold medal. Charles averaged 10.7 points per game, third best on the team and was the second leading rebounder with 4.8 per game.\nCharles played for Team USA at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.

        "title": "Golf swing",
        "text": "The golf swing is the action by which players hit the ball in the sport of golf. The golf swing is a complex motion involving the whole body; the technicalities of the swing are known as golf stroke mechanics.\nThere are differing opinions on what constitutes a \"good\" golf swing. In \"Work and Power Analysis of the Golf Swing\", Nesbit and Serrano suggest the golf swing has been studied by scientists and mathematicians who have developed various equations to help explain the complexity of the swing. It is generally agreed that a successful and consistent golf swing requires precise timing and mechanics, from the grip and position of one's fingers, to the position and movement of the feet. At any moment of the swing, whether back-swing, downswing, or upswing, something can go wrong that will throw off the whole body and result in a mishit. The entire swing motion should move on a plane in a fluid manner. The plane can be characterized as horizontal or vertical.\nComplex motion.\nThe goal of the golf swing is to direct kinetic energy into the club head so when it comes into contact with the ball, the energy will transfer to the ball, sending it into flight. Before a swing is taken the golfer first adopts their stance. This is usually a partial crouch because it allows for a more effective range of movement whilst also preloading the muscles. The stance is critical in making sure that the golfer has a low center of gravity in order that they may remain balanced throughout the swing path. The swing starts with the arms moving back in a straight line. When the club head reaches the level of the hip, two things happen: there is a stern wrist cock that acts as a hinge along with the left knee (for a right-handed swing), building up its torque by moving into the same line as the belly button before the start of the upswing. As the swing continues to the top of the backswing (again for right-handed golf swing), the golfer's left arm should be perfectly straight and his right arm should be hinged at the elbow.\nThe downswing begins with the hips and the lower body rather than the arms and upper body, with emphasis on the wrist cock. As the golfer's hips shift towards the target and begin rotate, the right elbow will drop straight down, hugging the right side of the golfer's torso. As the right elbow drops, the wrists begin to snap through from the wrist cock in the backswing. A solid extension of the arms and good transfer of body should put the golfer leaning up on his right toe, balanced, with the golf club resting on the back of the golfers neck. Importantly, all of the movements occur with precise timing, while the head remains completely still with eyes focused on the ball throughout the entire swing.\nMusculature.\nA golf stroke uses muscles on core (especially erector spinae muscles and latissimus dorsi muscle when turning), hamstring, shoulder and wrist. Stronger muscles on wrist can prevent wrists from being twisted at swings, while stronger shoulders increase the turning force. Weak wrists can also deliver the impacts to elbows and even neck and lead to injury of them. (When a muscle contracts, it pulls equally from both ends and, in order to have movement at only one end of the muscle, other muscles must come into play to stabilize the bone to which the other end of the muscle is attached.) Golf is a unilateral exercise that can break body balances, requiring exercises to keep the balance in muscles. A recommended exercise is free weight, an exercise not reliant on machines to stimulate and balance the fine muscles.\nTiming.\nTiming is the most critical element of the golf swing because it connects all of the different moving parts of the body into one motion. The golf swing follows a double pendulum model, where the arms and shoulders become the first pendulum and movements along the hands, grip, and shaft form the second. Both of these interlocking pendulum movements must be timed correctly in order to reach maximum club head speed.\n\"On the backswing aka the first part of the swing, the order of movement goes like this: hands, arms, shoulders, hips\" (\"Ben Hogan: Five Lessons: the Modern Fundamentals\"). The downswing (the second part of the swing) is initiated by the shifting and unwinding of the hips. Then the shoulders and arms follow.\nPower.\nThe golf swing is capable of producing great force, though it takes practice to be able to effectively utilize it in a productive manner. Most amateur golfers try to get as much power as possible, and try to hit the ball as far as possible, but this is not an appropriate approach for an amateur. The power of the golf swing is not unlocked by muscle or by fastest club head speed, but by the precise timing and mechanics of a motion that has to be put together in harmony. However, more power in the golf swing can be attributed to the development of these lower limb muscles: tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius medialis, gastrocnemius lateralis, biceps femoris, semitendinosus, gluteus maximus, vastus medialis, rectus femoris and vastus lateralis. With more power, comes the necessity for more control over the body that a golfer must have to control the motions of the swing. \"Strength and inertial variations seem more likely than size to account for long and short hitting\".\nStroke types.\nChip.\nThe chip is a type of shot generally used from short range around the green usually under 40 yards. Although any club may be used, and there are specialist chipping clubs (or chippers) available, a short iron or wedge is most common.\nThe goal of the chip is to land the ball safely on the green and let it roll out towards the hole.\nPitch.\nA \"pitch shot\" is a shot played with a high lofted club, a lob wedge, sand wedge, gap wedge, or pitching wedge, with lofts ranging from 49° to 62°. These high lofted clubs are designed to hit the ball high from short distances, usually from and closer.\nPutt.\nThe putt is used for putting the ball in the hole or closer to the hole (as in lagging) from the green or the fringe of the green. It can also be done from off the fringe and from in the fairway, especially on Bermuda Grass. The putter is used for the putt. The golfer adjusts their putt to fit the circumstances of the play such as distance to the hole and slope of the green.\nThe face of the club starts square to the target line. The club goes straight back and straight through along the same path like a pendulum. One strategy is to aim the ball 10% past the hole. Another is to look at the hole for long putts instead of the ball.\nReferences.\n“Golf Science Research at the Beginning of the Twenty-First Century: Journal of Sports Sciences: Vol 21, No 9.”\nHume, Keogh, and Reid, “The Role of Biomechanics in Maximizing Distance and Accuracy of Golf Shots.”"

        "text": "The UCLA women's volleyball program began its first year in 1965. Andy Banachowski was the head coach each year since 1965 until his retirement after the 2009 season, with the exception of the two seasons of 1968–69 and 1969–70, after he graduated from UCLA. In those seasons, Mardi Hardy Monroe was the head coach. Michael Sealy took over as head coach in 2010 and led the team to a national championship in 2011.\nBanachowski had more wins than any other NCAA Division I women's volleyball coach, with a record (since 1970, since no records were kept from 1965 to 1969) of 1,106–301. Banachowski had led UCLA to six national championships (3 NCAA–1984, 1990, 1991; 2 AIAW–1974, 1975; and 1 DGWS–1972). UCLA has made 27 of 28 NCAA tournaments and has made 11 NCAA Final Fours, which is tied with Nebraska as the second most Final Four appearances of all Division I programs.\nNCAA championships.\n1984.\nUCLA claimed the program's first NCAA national title (fourth overall) after four previous runner-up finishes following the team's 1975 AIAW title. In the deciding fifth game against Stanford, UCLA was down 12–4, but with heroics from Liz Masakayan, the Bruins continued to chip away at the lead before earning match point at 14–13. Masakayan had the final kill to give UCLA the 15–13 win.\n1990.\nUCLA won the NCAA title by defeating Pacific 15–9, 15–12, 15–7. UCLA was led by Natalie Williams and Marissa Hatchett who had 12 kills a piece. The Bruins finished the 1990 season 36–1.\n1991.\nPlaying at Pauley Pavilion, the Bruins repeated as NCAA champions by defeating Long Beach State in five games. After losing the first two games by the scores of 15–12, 15–13, UCLA completed off a huge comeback to take the next three games, 15–12, 15–6, 15–11.\nUCLA's comebacks was one of the biggest in NCAA history, since this match, no team had ever before rallied from 2 games to 0 to win in five games in the NCAA national championship. UCLA finished their season 31–5\n2011.\nAfter 20 years, the UCLA Bruins captured their fourth NCAA title and seventh overall by defeating Illinois 3–1 on December 17, 2011, at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas. The Bruins were seeded ninth in the NCAA championship tournament. On their way to the title game, they defeated 4-time defending champions Penn State and No. 1 seeded Texas to face No. 3 seeded Illinois. Rachael Kidder was named the most outstanding player of the tournament. Lauren Van Orden and Zoe Nightingale were also named to the all tournament team.

        "text": "Played in Spring 2021*\nMinnesota Golden Gophers volleyball is the NCAA Division I women's volleyball team at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. The program began its first season in 1972 under head coach Dee Jilek. Its current head coach is Keegan Cook, who took over the team at the conclusion of the 2022 season, following the resignation of Hugh McCutcheon. Previous coach Mike Hebert had led the Golden Gophers to every NCAA Tournament, with the exception of 1998, when he was head coach of the team. His tenure was highlighted by back-to-back NCAA Final Four appearances in 2003 and 2004. Hebert also led Minnesota the program's first Big Ten title in 2002.\nFinal Four appearances.\n2003.\nEven with a 13 overall tournament seed, Minnesota beat Washington in the regional final in five sets to advance to the school's first NCAA Final Four. In the national semifinals, Minnesota played top ranked and undefeated Southern California tough, but fell in three sets. Minnesota was led by Cassie Busse with 23 kills and Erin Martin with 11.\n2004.\nThe tournament's #4 overall seed, Minnesota defeated fifth-seeded Ohio State in the regional final to advance to their second straight national semifinal. Once again, they met Southern California, but the outcome was different than the previous year. Behind 18 kills from Minnesota's Erin Martin, the Golden Gophers defeated the two-time defending NCAA Champions in four sets to advance to the program's first NCAA national championship.\nIn the final against Stanford, Minnesota could not stop Ogonna Nnamani and struggled to find an offensive rhythm, falling in three straight sets to finish as national runners-up. Despite leaving the match against Stanford with a neck injury, Minnesota All-American libero Paula Gentil set an NCAA tournament record for digs in the NCAA tournament with 173 total in six matches.\n2009.\nMinnesota, the 11th seed, earned its third Final Four appearance since 2003 by defeating third seeded Florida State 3–1 (25–20, 25–7, 18–25, 25–17). This appearance marks the second time Minnesota has qualified for the Final Four via playing on its home court: \"The Sports Pavilion\" – the first time occurred during the 2004 tournament. Minnesota was knocked out of the national semifinals by Texas in three sets.\n2015.\nAfter a frustrating 2014 season that saw the Golden Gophers miss the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1998, Minnesota started the season unranked in the AVCA preseason poll, and was picked to finish fifth in the Big Ten. Under the stewardship of Big Ten Coach of the Year and AVCA Coach of the Year Hugh McCutcheon, and led by the play of four AVCA All-Americans, Minnesota trumped all expectations, on its way to an 18–2 Big Ten conference record that was the best in its history and earned the program its second-ever Big Ten conference championship, the first one since 2002. The Golden Gophers entered the NCAA Tournament with a 26–4 record that earned them the top seed in their bracket and the No. 2 overall seed. After dropping just one set in regional play, Minnesota arrived at the Final Four in Omaha, Nebraska, where it lost in the national semifinals to the Texas Longhorns.\n2016.\nMinnesota lost 3–1 to eventual national champion Stanford in the 2016 NCAA semifinals. Minnesota had been ranked #1 in the final AVCA regular-season poll, but were seeded #2 going into the tournament, behind #1 Nebraska.\n2019.\nAs the overall #7 seed in the tournament, Minnesota advanced to its sixth Final Four in program history with a 3-0 sweep of unseeded Louisville. As in 2016, Minnesota lost to eventual national champion Stanford in the 2019 NCAA semifinals.\nAll-Americans.\nA list of first, second, third team and honorable mention AVCA All-American volleyball players."

        "text": "The Scotland national men's lacrosse team is governed by Lacrosse Scotland and is currently coached by Matt Bagley (2023 WC). Previous coaches include Graham Simpson (1994 WC), Lee Wilkinson (1996 EC), Phil Collier (1998 WC, 1999 EC, 2002 WC), Phil Moore (2000 EC), John Robinson (2001 EC), Keith Langdale (2006 WC), John Kenney (2008 EC, 2010 WC, 2012 EC, 2014 WC), and Brian Silcott (2016 EC, 2018 WC).\nHistory.\nPrior to the Lockerbie air disaster in December 1988, the men's game had not been represented in Scotland since the turn of the 20th century. The tragedy of Pan Am Flight 103 saw many Syracuse University students perish and on a memorial visit one year later the University's lacrosse team were surprised that there was no Scotland national men's team for them to compete against. The country was challenged to pull together an inaugural and bona fide team; this was achieved some eight months later and following the 1990 World Championships the men's team played their first representative match. Scotland has now played memorial games against Syracuse during visits to Lockerbie to pay their respects to those lost in the air disaster, and hope this fixture will continue into the future.\nThe 1994 World Series was a tremendous showcase for the sport and an opportunity for Scotland to make its name on the World stage. Scotland wanted people in Scotland to hear more about this fine sport and inspire greater grass roots participation through the existing British Lacrosse Development Program. The development game, Pop Lacrosse, a mixed sport played in schools is growing at an impressive rate. During 1997/8 Pop Lacrosse was introduced to nearly 100 schools in the Fife, Lothian, SW Region, Perthshire, Tayside, Central and Strathclyde areas. The numbers of players coached was in excess of 10,000 and the number of PE teachers educated in coaching was nearly 250.\nSince that time Scotland have been represented at every European and World Championships held. Scotland have ranked 3rd in Europe and 6th in the World Championships.\nWorld Lacrosse Championships.\n2014.\nThis was the second World Championships with Head Coach John Kenney at helm, after an impressive 7th placed finish in 2010. Scotland were placed in the White Division and won all 3 pool games, scoring 61 goals in the process, and advanced to play Finland in the play-in games. Scotland overcame Finland and then New Zealand to advance into the quarter-finals. A narrow defeat to the Iroqouis (10-8) saw Scotland face-off against Japan, with a place in the elite Blue Division at stake. After two periods of over time, Scotland took the victory (9-8). The final game of the tournament pitched the Scots against their \nrivals England in a fierce game that ended with another narrow defeat (15-13). Despite this narrow loss Scotland still finished in 6th place overall and will compete in the Blue Division in 2018.\n2010.\nIn the 2010 World Lacrosse Championship, Scotland was in the Turquoise Division. They won their division with a 3-0 record, and finished with an overall record of 6-2, earning them a 7th-place finish overall. Game results were as follows:\n2006.\nIn the 2006 World Lacrosse Championship, Scotland was in the \"red division\", i.e. the second tier. Results were as follows:\nRed division standings after the round-robin phase of the tournament were:\nFinals.\nWith the nations ranked amongst their division, they played off for their final standings. The winner from each lower group played a lower-ranked nation from Blue division for their shot at the championship. Scotland's results were as follows:\nThe final standings were:\nEuropean Lacrosse Championships.\nScotland has been represented in every European Championship, dating back to the very first one in 1995 in Prague-Pilsen, Czech Republic. In the last played games in 2016, Scotland finished 8th out of 24 participating countries.\nNational Box Lacrosse team.\nThe Scotland national indoor lacrosse team was reformed in 2018 through the generation of a domestic box lacrosse league and is currently managed by Brendan Cook (general manager), Brian Witmer (head coach) and Navi Mahal (assistant coach). The team will be participating in the World Indoor Lacrosse Championships 2019.\nUnder-19 team.\nScotland made their first appearance in the Men's Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships during the 2008 tournament.

        "text": "The 2009 Men's Division III Rugby Tournament is a tournament which involved 103 schools playing in a single-elimination tournament to determine the national champion of men's NSCRO Division III college rugby as a culmination of the 2008–09 rugby season. It began in the fall 2008 season in the northeast, midwest and mid-atlantic, and picked up again in the spring 2009 season for the southern teams, and concludes with the Fearsome Four, a final four-style semifinals and championship games co-hosted by South Jersey RFC on April 25-6 in Cherry Hill, New Jersey.\nNational Semifinal.\nThe National Semifinals were held on a warm sunny day, on a badly worn pitch at Green Acre Park in Cherry Hill, NJ. The event was not well publicized. Each match was attended by about 40 rugby fans, friends and family members. The event host, South Jersey RFC, had a small concession lean-to, offering pretzels, sodas and event T-shirts.\nIn the first match of the day, New England Rugby Football Union Champion Salve Regina met NY State Rugby Conference Champion SUNY Oswego. Salve Regina was the only true small college in the tournament (having approximately 500 male students to SUNY's 3000), and it showed. SUNY's large squad took advantage of poor SRU tackling up the middle and took a 22-0 lead into halftime. The first half was led by the dominance of Oswego flankers Matt Moir (senior)with 4 tries, Kandu Agmibson, fly half Jordan Storie (senior captain), and outside center Jay McGukin (senior captain).\nIn the second half, Oswego replaced four of its starters including starting scrum half and senior captain Alex Rufer among others due to injury and conservation for the finals match, which was to be determined. Consequently, SRU showed some spirit and put points on the board, exchanging tries with SUNY, but they never really got the hang of EPRU referee Pete Hesler's refusal to penalize an offside. And on those other penalties that were called, SRU was physically restrained from quicktapping on multiple occasions by Hesler to allow Oswego to adequately retreat. One such restraint took place on the Oswego 5m line, evoking a barrage of criticism from the SRU sideline, and for which they probably should have been disciplined. Overall, SUNY Oswego was by far the better team on the day, running in multiply tries from outside the 22m.\nIn the second match, VRU Champion Longwood met USA Rugby South Champion Coastal Carolina. The two teams were well coached and matched up very well. Again, however, the large college program carried the day. Coastal Carolina was physically larger, and took an early lead, but Longwood battled back, playing smart rugby and making some key kicks for points. At halftime, Coastal Carolina held a 17-13 lead. In the second half, fitness seemed to be an issue, not so much for the teams, but for the officiating crew, all of whom seemed to be approaching 60 years old and overweight. Apparently, the event host had some difficulty arranging referees, and had to do some last minute scrambling to obtain referee coverage. Longwood took a brief lead, before giving it back to Coastal Carolina for good about midway through the second half. Coastal Carolina was the best team on Saturday. They were big, fit, aggressive and knowledgeable. Longwood matched them in every category but size and points.\nRegional Brackets.\nNortheast Regional Bracket.\nThe Northeast Regional Bracket is the home of USA Rugby territorial union Northeast Rugby Union (\"NRU\") (partial).

        "title": "1908–09 Australia rugby union tour of Britain",
        "text": "The 1908–09 Australia rugby union tour of the British Isles was a collection of friendly rugby union games undertaken by the Australia national rugby union team against invitational and national teams from England and Wales, as well as several games against sides from North America. This was the first Australian tour of the Northern Hemisphere and the side is sometimes referred to as the \"First Wallabies\".\nBoth the New Zealand and South African teams had toured Europe in 1905 and 1906 respectively, both achieving unexpected but deserved success against club and international opposition. Despite the success of these two touring teams, Australia suffered poor press and with only a single win after the teams' first twelve international matches in its history to that point, few people suggested the team would do well. Against low expectations the Australians played well, winning 25 of 31 matches played on the tour and with some commentators writing that the team would have achieved better results if they had not picked up so many injuries.\nAustralia took in two recognised international games, against Wales and England, but failed to play any games in Scotland or Ireland due to the Irish and Scottish Unions resenting the International Rugby Board's attitude regarding the Australian invitation.\nThe squad's leadership.\nTour manager, who performed the role of coach was New South Wales state selector James McMahon, a veteran of the early NSWRU representative fixtures of 1889 and 1894 against New Zealand. He was assisted by Stan Wickham who had captained the Wallabies on 10 occasions between 1904 and 1905. Tour captain was Dr. Herbert 'Paddy' Moran. The team was also captained in matches during the tour by Chris McKivat and by Fred Wood, the tour vice-captain. They played in blue shirts, emblazoned with the Waratah. Players were paid 3 shillings a day in expenses.\nMoran writes in \"Viewless Winds\" that when the touring squad first arrived at Plymouth a pack of journalists were there who were anxious to give the team some distinctive name. The \"Rabbits\" was instantaneously rejected and soon after the team adopted the moniker of \"The Wallabies\" which for many years was used to describe the Australia national rugby union team when touring to Britain. These days the national side are the Wallabies whether playing at home or anywhere abroad.\nMoran also describes as \"an affliction\" the war-cry which the parent Union in Australia had suggested the team should use for its \"box-office value\". Moran wrote:\nEchoing the feelings of the Australian team towards the war-cry, there was little respect shown from their opponents towards it either. In the encounter with Cardiff at the Cardiff Arms Park, Percy Bush responded to the cry by charging onto the pitch brandishing a sword and shield, in what was intended to be an amusing riposte.\nTour itinerary.\nThe squad left Sydney on 8 August 1908 on board the \"SS Omrah\" bound for Melbourne. The ship contained 116 passengers, 1579 bales of wool, 2729 carcasses of mutton, 4650 carcasses of lamb, 2000 quarters of beef, 4800 crates of frozen rabbits and 200 tonnes of lead and copper. They played a game at the MCG against a Victorian XV which was won 26–6. They docked in Fremantle and played and won a fixture against a Western Australian XV 58–6.\nOn the long voyage Moran introduced the practice of team meetings that were part lecture and part brain–storming with players encouraged to voice their ideas on improving team performance. Moran stood at a blackboard and while his lecturing style was initially derided by the players he managed to instill a sense of cleverness and skill in players, creating thoughts of rugby as similar to a game of chess. The Sydney forward Cecil Murnin became ill on the voyage and left the tour in Naples to return to Australia.\nThe first tour match in England was against Devon. Peter Burge broke a leg in that match and did not play again on the tour. Australia won the match with fourteen men. Bob Craig had brought a carpet snake in his luggage as a tour mascot and the snake died that same day. The fourth tour match saw the Wallabies pitted against the best players from Cardiff and Swansea playing as Glamorgan County. The match at Pontypridd drew a crowd of 20,000 who gave the visitors a standing ovation. In that match another player was lost to a broken leg – this time from the sideline. The Queensland forward Flanagan was running the flag as line–umpire and collided with the winger \"Boxer\" Russell. Australia's first loss was the ninth match, against Llanelli RFC – a spirited encounter which saw the Llanelli side win the match 8–3 and themselves a place in local sporting folklore.\nOlympic Wallabies.\nDuring the tour, the Olympic Games were being held in London. The Australian team entered the rugby tournament and were the only other team alongside Cornwall, who were representing Great Britain. The interest in the Olympic rugby final was only lukewarm with the final being held in the last week of Games that had taken place over six months.\nAustralia had already beaten Cornwall, the British county champions early in the tour. Scottish and Irish Unions had turned down the RFU's invitation to participate in the Olympic bouts. France were expected to contest the medal, but had withdrawn, leaving just Australia and Cornwall for England team to play for gold and silver medals.\nThe match was played on an area alongside the Olympic Games swimming pool which measured 110 yards in length with a long line of netting stretched beside to catch flying balls. Large mattresses were spread along the rim of the pool to prevent injuries to falling players. One day was allocated to what was called the Olympic rugby tournament. Neither Moran, nor the tour vice-captain Fred Wood played so Chris McKivat led the Wallabies to an easy 32–3 victory and to Olympic glory, with each Wallaby in that match thereafter an Olympic gold medallist.\nTour statistics.\nThe tour took in 31 games in the British Isles, with the Australians winning 25, losing five and drawing one. Of the Test matches, the team lost against Wales, but beat England. These matches were the first ever encounters between an Australian team and their hosts. A further two matches were played in Australia en route and there were five matches in the US and Canada.\nThe Wallabies scored 438 points on tour to 149 against, scoring 104 tries in the process and averaging better than three tries per game with 80 scored by the backs and 24 by the forwards.\nMatch summary.\nComplete list of matches played by Australia at British Isles and North America:\n Test matches\nTest matches.\nWales.\nAfter the tours by the New Zealand and South African teams, the Welsh crowds were beginning to become fatigued at greeting another 'colonial' team, and the crowd of 30,000 at the Cardiff Arms Park was smaller than previous in tours. Those that attended were repaid with an exciting and close encounter, with two tries from both sides and Wales winning by just a single penalty goal. The contest between the forwards was described as 'tremendous', and at the end of the match Moran was chaired from the ground by the Welsh supporters. Moran was later quoted as saying: \"It was a very gruelling game; in fact, I think it was one of the hardest games I had ever played in.\"\nMoran describes the last fifteen minutes as tremendously hard. Twice or three times the Australian backs either crossed the line or knocked down a corner post without being able to score. In the dying moments one of the Australian wingers made a break with just Bert Winfield to beat. Instead of stepping or fending him the Wallaby three-quarter attempted to barge through and both players collapsed to the ground. The whistle blew and the Test was Wales'.\nEngland.\nThe match was to have been played at Twickenham but bad weather had delayed the construction of the stand and it was moved to Blackheath.\nEngland had ten new caps, including all four three-quarters. England started well and Edgar Mobbs scored. Wallaby Norman Row kicked an up-and-under, followed up and scored to level the scores. Half-time came at 3-all. Australia dominated the second half. Boxer Russell scored the Wallabies' second and third tries.\nAlthough the Australian team won by three tries to one, sections of the British press reported that the tourists were fortunate to win. This was typical of the press, which had unfairly compared the Australians to the All Black and Springbok teams throughout the tour. Moran had suffered an Achilles-tendon injury in a prior match and missed the England encounter, so the captaincy was given to McKivat."

Four events took place, all being staged at Lord's Cricket Ground in front of temporary stands built to accommodate up to 6,500 spectators.\nSouth Korea was the most successful nation, topping the medal table with three golds and four medals in total.\nCompetition format.\nA total of 128 athletes competed across the four events: the men's individual, women's individual, men's team, and women's team.\nAll four events were recurve archery events, held under the FITA-approved 70-metre distance and rules. The competition started with an initial ranking round involving all 64 archers of each gender. Each archer shot a total of 72 arrows to be seeded from 1–64 according to their score.\nThe ranking round was also used to seed the teams from 1 to 12, by aggregating the individual scores for the members of each team.\nEach event was then played in a single-elimination tournament format, except for the semi-final losers, who played-off to decide the bronze medal winner.\nIndividual events.\nIn the individual events, all 64 competitors entered the competition at the first round, the round of 64. The draw was seeded according to the result of the ranking round so the first seed shot against the 64th seed in the first round.\nEach match was the best-of-five sets, with three arrows per set. The winner of each set received two points, and if the scores in the set were tied then each archer received one point. If at the end of five sets the score was tied at 5–5, a single arrow shoot-off would be held and the closest to the centre would be declared the winner.\nTeam events.\nIn the team events, the top four seeded teams from the ranking round received a bye to the quarter-final. The remaining eight teams, seeded 5th to 12th, competed for the remaining four places in the quarter-finals.\nEach match consisted of 24 arrows from each team (eight from each team member) and the team with the highest score progressed. In the event of scores being tied, a three-arrow shoot-off would take place.\nSchedule.\nAll times are British Summer Time ().\nQualification.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) was permitted to enter a maximum of six competitors, three per gender. NOCs that qualified teams for a particular gender were able to send a three-member team to the team event and also have each member compete in the individual event. There were 12 team spots for each gender, thus qualifying 36 individuals through team qualification. All other NOCs may earn a maximum of one quota place per gender for the individual events.\nSix places were reserved for Great Britain as the host nation, and a further six were decided by the Tripartite Commission. The remaining 116 places were then allocated through a qualification process, in which archers earned quota places for their respective NOCs, though not necessarily for themselves.\nTo be eligible to participate in the Olympic Games after the NOC has obtained a quota place, all archers must have achieved the following minimum qualification score (MQS):\nThe MQS must have been achieved between 2 July 2011 (starting at the 2011 World Outdoor Archery Championships) and 1 July 2012 at a registered FITA event.\nMedal summary.\nGallery.\nGallery of some of the Olympic medalists in the archery competitions:"

The venues were the London Velopark for track cycling and BMX, and Hadleigh Farm, in Essex, for mountain biking. The road races took place over a course starting and ending in The Mall in central London and heading out into Surrey, while the time trials started and finished at Hampton Court Palace in Richmond upon Thames. Eighteen events were contested and around 500 athletes participated.\nCycling events have been contested in every Summer Olympics programme since the first modern Olympiad in 1896 alongside athletics, artistic gymnastics, fencing and swimming. Compared to the cycling at the 2008 Olympics, there were many changes in the Olympic track cycling programme. The men's and women's individual pursuit and points race, and the men's Madison were removed. Team sprint, team pursuit and keirin were added to the women's programme, while Omnium was a new race for both men and women. Countries were restricted to one entry per track event, a restriction which seemed to be directed at preventing the British team from double-medalling in the same event as they had in four events in 2008, thus lowering their medal chances. However, similar to the 2008 Beijing Games, the cycling events were dominated by the British team, which, with a haul including eight gold medals, was the only nation to win more than a single gold medal.\nVenues.\nThe road racing at the Olympics and Paralympic Games was originally scheduled to take place in Regent's Park and on Hampstead Heath. Instead, the Olympic road races started and finished on The Mall in central London and headed out in a south-westerly direction to include loops around Box Hill in Surrey. Road racing in the Paralympics took place at Brands Hatch. The Olympic mountain bike event took place at Hadleigh Farm after the UCI labeled the course at Weald Country Park \"too easy\" in July 2008. It was touted that the course could be created in Wales. A location in Kent was also considered.\nParticipating nations.\nCyclists from 74 nations participated at the 2012 Summer Olympics."

        "title": "Steven Wright (baseball)",
        "text": "Steven Richard Wright (born August 30, 1984) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. Wright played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston Red Sox, having made his MLB debut in 2013; he was an All-Star in 2016. He is known for his knuckleball pitch.\nWright received two World Series rings in 2013 and 2018 as a member of the Red Sox for being on the active roster, but did not play in the playoffs.\nAmateur baseball career.\nBorn in Torrance, California, Wright attended Valley View High School in Moreno Valley, California and the University of Hawaii. While at Hawaii, Wright was named a second-team All-American as a junior in 2006. He had an 11–2 record with a 2.30 ERA in 110 innings. In 2005, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League, where he was named a league all-star and helped Orleans to the 2005 league championship.\nProfessional career.\nCleveland Indians.\nThe Cleveland Indians selected Wright in the second round of the 2006 MLB draft. From 2007 to 2012, Wright played Minor League Baseball with the Lake County Captains, Kinston Indians, Akron Aeros, and Columbus Clippers, all affiliates of the Cleveland Indians. With the 2008 Akron Aeros, he pitched a career-high 75 innings.\nWright has a 90-mph fastball, but he turned to the knuckleball as his primary pitch in the 2011 season as a collective decision among Wright and the Indians.\nBoston Red Sox.\nOn July 31, 2012, the Indians traded Wright to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for Lars Anderson at the trade deadline.\nAfter an injury to Boston relief pitcher Joel Hanrahan in April 2013, the Red Sox called Wright up to the major leagues. Wright's first major league experience was against the Indians, the team that traded him in 2012, but he saw no action in the three-game series.\n2013.\nOn April 23, 2013, Wright was called into a game versus the Oakland Athletics to relieve Alfredo Aceves. The first batter he faced, Brandon Moss, hit into a double play. Wright allowed five runs in innings, and was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket after the game.\nOn July 11, Wright earned his first major league win, against the Seattle Mariners. Wright pitched shutout innings in relief of Ryan Dempster. Koji Uehara picked up the save, and presented Wright with the ball following the victory. On August 1, Wright picked up his second win, also against the Mariners and again in relief of Dempster; Boston trailed 7–2 entering the ninth inning, but staged a comeback to walk off with an 8–7 victory, making Wright the winner. On August 6, while pitching in his first major league start, Wright's knuckleball caused catcher Ryan Lavarnway to tie a major league record with four passed balls in one inning. The record was originally set by Ray Katt of the New York Giants in 1954, catching knuckleballer Hoyt Wilhelm, and tied by Gino Petralli of the Texas Rangers in 1987, catching knuckleballer Charlie Hough.\nWright made four MLB appearances with one start during the season, accumulating a 5.40 ERA and a 2–0 record. He was also the recipient of the Red Sox' Lou Gorman Award. Wright was not included on the team's postseason roster.\n2014.\nWright began the 2014 season with Triple-A Pawtucket, going 5–3 with a 2.76 ERA before being recalled to Boston on August 17. In six major league games with the Red Sox, Wright made one start, going 0–1 with a 2.57 ERA in 21 innings pitched.\n2015.\nDuring a game started on April 10, 2015, against the Yankees, after a home run by Chase Headley in the bottom of the ninth pushed the game into extra innings, Wright, the intended starter for the next day, entered in the bottom of the 15th. Although yielding a tying run in both the 16th and 18th innings, Wright became the winning pitcher after five innings of relief. It was the longest game then played at the new Yankee Stadium, ending after 19 innings at with a 6–5 score, after six hours and 49 minutes (with an additional 16-minute delay due to a series of faulty stadium lights going out during the 12th inning). Later that morning, Wright was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket to make room for the returning Joe Kelly. Wright finished his MLB season with a 5–4 record, a 4.09 ERA, and innings pitched.\n2016.\nOn May 8, 2016, Wright pitched a complete game for the first time in his MLB career as the Red Sox won 5–1 over the Yankees. Wright gave up only three hits, struck out seven, and the lone run came on a solo home run by Brett Gardner with two outs in the ninth inning. Wright earned his first All-Star game nod, going 9–5 before the game, recording the lowest ERA of any AL starting pitcher before the break. On August 14, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list with bursitis in his right shoulder. He ended the 2016 season with a 13–6 record and 3.33 ERA after pitching innings in 24 starts.\n2017.\nOn May 4, 2017, it was announced that Wright would undergo left knee surgery for a cartilage restoration, therefore ending his season. He had made five appearances (all starts) with a 1–3 record and 8.25 ERA in 24 innings pitched.\n2018.\nOn March 23, 2018, MLB announced that Wright would be suspended for 15 games for violating the league's personal conduct policy. The suspension took effect on April 28, when Wright completed a rehabilitation assignment with Triple-A Pawtucket.\nOn May 14, Wright was activated by Boston, his suspension having been completed. After 10 appearances (including four starts), he was placed on the disabled list with a left knee injury on June 26; he received a PRP injection in the knee on July 2. Wright was sent on a rehabilitation assignment with Triple-A Pawtucket on August 28, and returned from the disabled list on September 1.\nOverall in 2018, Wright pitched innings over 20 appearances (including four starts), compiling a 3–1 record and 2.68 ERA. He also picked up his only MLB save on September 16, 2018 against the Mets. Initially included on Boston's postseason roster, Wright was removed and replaced by Heath Hembree for the ALDS and beyond due to his previous knee injury. The Red Sox went on to win the World Series over the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n2019.\nOn January 11, 2019, Wright and the Red Sox reached agreement on a one-year contract worth $1.375 million. On March 6, 2019, Wright received an 80-game suspension without pay after testing positive for Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide 2 (GHRP-2), a performance-enhancing substance, in violation of MLB’s Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program.\nWright made his first appearance of the season with Triple-A Pawtucket on a rehabilitation assignment in early June, and was added to Boston's active roster on June 25. Wright was placed on the injured list on July 14 with a right great toe contusion. On September 1, the Red Sox moved him to the 60-day injured list. For the season with Boston, Wright was 0–1 with an 8.53 ERA and five strikeouts in innings. Wright was released by the Red Sox on October 18, and he announced shortly thereafter that he would undergo Tommy John surgery.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nOn March 21, 2021, Wright signed a minor league contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates that included an invitation to spring training. In 18 appearances for the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians, Wright had a 6.68 ERA with 70 strikeouts. On August 19, 2021, Wright was released by the Pirates.\nPersonal life.\nWright and his wife Shannon have two children, a daughter and son. In December 2017, Wright was arrested for domestic assault,\nalthough the court case was \"retired\" and would be dismissed in December 2018 if no further incidents occur."

He was immediately assigned to the rookie level Grand Junction Rockies, where he went 3–2 with a 3.97 earned run average and 78 strikeouts in innings.\nJohnson gained a promotion to Single-A Asheville Tourists for 2006, and had a 13–5 record with a 4.04 ERA while striking out 123 in innings. He then opened 2007 with High-A Modesto Nuts, where he went 14–7 with a 2.99 ERA and 119 strikeouts in innings. Late in the year, he finished 2–0 with a 0.00 ERA in two starts for Double-A Tulsa Drillers.\nBut Johnson declined in 2008 with Tulsa, where he went 4–14 with a 5.23 ERA in 28 starts, striking out 92 in innings. Even though, he was promoted to Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox in 2009, where he went 10–6 with a 5.66 ERA in 26 games (24 starts), and strike out 76 in 143 innings.\nJohnson came back with the Sky Sox in 2010, finishing 10–8 with a 5.91 ERA in 28 games (25 starts), and striking out 100 in innings. He then made one start for the Sky Sox in 2011 before being promoted to the Rockies to replace Greg Reynolds.\nJohnson made his major league pitching debut on April 17, 2011. He was slated to start a game against the Chicago Cubs, and he allowed five runs (four earned) on six hits and three walks in four innings, leaving the game with the score tied, 5–5. The Rockies went on to win the game, 9–5, with Johnson not factoring in the decision. He then was designated for assignment on April 29, and was outrighted off the roster on May 3.\nJohnson returned to the Sky Sox and finished the year there in undistinguished fashion. He made 26 appearances (23 starts) and finished 5–11 with a 7.43 ERA and 85 strikeouts in 132 innings of work. As a result, he was released and became a minor league free agent.\nIn April 2012, Johnson signed with the Lancaster Barnstormers of the Atlantic League. In 27 games (26 starts) with the Barnstormers, he went 14–6 with a 4.57 ERA, striking out 79 in 138 innings. On March 11, 2013, Johnson re-signed with Lancaster.\nHis most recent appearance was in 2013, when he posted a 1–3 record with an 8.02 ERA in 10 games for Lancaster, including seven starts, striking out 20 while walking 21 in innings of work.\nIn between, Johnson played winter ball with the Tiburones de La Guaira club of the Venezuelan League in the 2009 season."

        "text": "Monday Night Golf is a series of match play golf challenge matches that ran from 1999 to 2005, and was revived in 2012. All the matches have involved World Number 1 Tiger Woods, and the first seven were run by his representatives IMG and were broadcast on ABC. The eighth was organized by Excel Sports Management, Woods' representatives since he left IMG in 2010. It marked the first time that live golf had been shown in prime time during the week in the United States.\nThe first match was played at Sherwood Country Club, and dubbed the \"Showdown at Sherwood\". The next three were held at Bighorn Golf Club and known as the \"Battle at Bighorn\", and the next three were known as the \"Battle at the Bridges\" and played at The Bridges at Rancho Santa Fe.\nMonday Night Golf proved to be an initial success, drawing more viewers than the final round of the U.S. Open, and being second only to the final round of the Masters Tournament in terms of golf broadcasts. Ratings increased significantly for the second match, but they declined rapidly after that, and the event was initially cancelled after the 2005 edition, with Woods also wishing to take a break from the event. However, on August 15, 2012, it was announced by Excel Sports Management that the first new match in seven years had been scheduled. It took place on October 29, 2012, at Lake Jinsha International Golf Club in China, and featured World No. 2 Woods facing World No. 1 and PGA Champion Rory McIlroy.\n1999 Showdown at Sherwood.\nThe first challenge match was played on August 2, 1999, between Tiger Woods and David Duval, then world number 2 and also a client of IMG. In order for the match to be played in daylight and still be shown live during prime time Eastern Standard Time, it was held in the West, at Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, California. Sherwood paid $1,000,000 to host the event, which was dubbed the Showdown at Sherwood.\nThe match was eagerly anticipated as a head-to-head between the two leading players at the time, and contested over 18 holes in a matchplay format. Woods won the match 2&amp;1 to collect a check for $1,100,000, with Duval picking up $400,000. Both players donated $200,000 to charity, split between the First Tee initiative and charities of their choice. The match proved to be a ratings success, drawing a 6.9 national Nielsen rating, higher than what had been predicted by broadcasters ABC Sports.\n2000 Battle at Bighorn.\nThe second challenge match was played over the Canyons course at Bighorn Golf Club in Palm Desert, California on August 28, 2000, between Tiger Woods and Sergio García, who had made the headlines when finishing as runner-up to Woods at the 1999 PGA Championship. As with the previous year, the match was contested over 18 holes in matchplay format, with the winner collecting $1,100,000 and the runner-up $400,000.\nThe Battle at Bighorn, as it was titled, was won by García 1up, and as in 1999, both players donated a portion of their winnings to charity. The match was an even bigger ratings success than the inaugural event, drawing a 7.6 Nielsen rating, which proved to be the highest in the series.\n2001 Battle at Bighorn.\nThe second Battle at Bighorn saw a change of format, with two mixed teams competing over 18 holes in foursomes (alternate shot) matchplay. Tiger Woods and David Duval, who had contested the Showdown at Sherwood two years previously, were joined by the worlds two leading female golfers, as organisers sought to raise the profile of the women's game. Woods was paired with Annika Sörenstam, and Duval with Karrie Webb.\nThe match finished under lights and was won by Woods and Sörenstam with a par at the first extra hole. They had come from 2 behind with three holes to play, Sörenstam taking the match into sudden death by holing a 10-foot birdie putt on the 18th.\nWoods and Sörenstam shared the $1,200,000 winners check, with Duval and Webb sharing $500,000. Viewing figures for this third show were down markedly from the previous year, returning a 6.1 Nielsen rating.\n2002 Battle at Bighorn.\nThe third Battle at Bighorn took place on July 29, 2002, and saw another change of format as Tiger Woods and Sergio García, who had fought out the first Bighorn match, were joined by two of golfs all-time greats in a fourball betterball matchplay contest. Woods was paired with 18 time major winner Jack Nicklaus, and García with 6 time major winner Lee Trevino, who triumphed over Nicklaus in a play-off for the 1971 U.S. Open.\nThe match was won by Woods and Nicklaus 3 &amp; 2, with Woods making the major contribution, recording nine birdies in the 16 holes that were played. Despite the apparent attraction of some of the biggest names in golf, viewing figures had fallen even further from the previous years low, with this fourth instalment generating a 5.1 Nielsen rating.\n2003 Battle at the Bridges.\nThe fifth match in the series took place on July 28, 2003, and used the same fourball format as the previous year, but with four top PGA Tour players. Woods and García were again in opposition, this time paired with Ernie Els and Phil Mickelson respectively. The match also had a new venue, The Bridges Club in Rancho Santa Fe, California, and was titled Battle at the Bridges as a result.\nThe match finished under lights, with García and Mickelson coming out on top, defeating their then world number one and two ranked opponents 3 &amp; 1. García eagled the 16th hole to put himself and Mickelson on the road to the $1,200,000 winners prize. Woods and Els shared $500,000, with $300,000 being donated to charity.\nFor the third year running, viewing figures fell, with the first instalment of a three-year deal at the Bridges recording a 4.6 Nielsen rating.\n2004 Battle at the Bridges.\nThe second Battle at the Bridges was played on August 2, 2004, in the now established fourball betterball format. The theme was long drivers. Tiger Woods was joined by Hank Kuehne to take on the pairing of Phil Mickelson and John Daly.\nDaly and Mickelson started well and were 2 up through 12 holes, but Woods and Kuehne made three straight birdies followed by an eagle to win the next four holes and take a 2 up lead themselves. They halved the 17th hole to win the match 2 &amp; 1.\nRatings for the Battle at the Bridges continued to slide, with the 2004 edition producing a 3.6 Nielsen rating, the lowest of the series to date.\n2005 Battle at the Bridges.\nThe final Battle at the Bridges took place on July 25, 2005. Organisers had wanted this last exhibition to be contested by the big four names in world golf at the time, Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Vijay Singh and Ernie Els but Singh refused to take part, so Tiger Woods was teamed up with John Daly, to take on Mickelson and Els. However Els later withdrew and was replaced by Retief Goosen.\nIn the most one sided match of the series, Mickelson and Goosen won 5 &amp; 3, to collect $500,000 each plus $100,000 for each of their nominated charities. Woods and Daly picked up $200,000 each, with $50,000 for their charities. It was also the first match not to reach the floodlit last three holes, as Goosen made four birdies in six holes to seal the win at the 15th.\nWith ratings failing to pick up, and Woods stating his desire to take a break from the event, this proved to be the final match in the series.\n2012 Duel at Lake Jinsha.\nOn August 15, 2012, it was announced that an eighth match (and the first in seven years) would take place on October 29, 2012, at Lake Jinsha International Golf Club in China. It will feature Woods facing Rory McIlroy, who was coming off a four win PGA Tour season, and at the time of the announcement had just won the PGA Championship. Woods, meanwhile, had won three times during the season. He was also ranked first in the FedEx Cup Standings at the time, while McIlroy was ranked first in the World Golf Rankings. This was the first match to take place in the FedEx Cup era.\nBy the time of the match, Woods was the World No. 2, while McIlroy was World No. 1.\nWhile ESPN/ABC televised the first seven matches, Australian syndicator Spondo distributed a pay-per-view internet feed. At the outset, many of the United States servers were swamped and many viewers had to wait until midway through the front nine to view the stream, at which time the bandwidth was increased, and most viewers could watch.\nThe match was played in a stroke play format, and was closely contested. McIlroy built a three shot lead after three holes, but with a birdie at seven and a chip-in at twelve, Woods closed the gap to one. Woods missed birdie putts to tie McIlroy at both sixteen and seventeen, and needed to hole a greenside bunker shot at the final hole to salvage extra holes. He lipped out and instead settled for par and a four-under 68. McIlroy brushed in a three-footer for par and a 67 (-5), to win by a shot.\nRatings.\n1 point is 1 percent of American TVs that were tuned into Monday Night Golf."

        "text": "Rugby union in the Czech Republic is a growing sport. As of 1 November 2010, they are currently ranked thirty-first in the International Rugby Board's world rankings.\nTraditionally, Czech rugby has centred on a \"section of the middle class\" in and around Prague, which has been fairly small but fairly loyal to the sport.\nThe Czech Republic has also been popular with touring sides, because of its relatively low beer prices, and historic surroundings.\nGoverning body.\nCzechoslovakia was a founder member of FIRA in 1934, and joined the IRB in 1988.\nRugby union in the Czech Republic is governed by a national body called the Česká Rugbyová Unie (ČSRU). The president of the ČSRU is Pavel Telička.\nHistory.\nJosef Rössler-Ořovský, who introduced a number of sports in the then Czechoslovakia, among others skiing and tennis, was originally credited with starting rugby as well back in 1895. He went to England and brought back a rugby ball with him. Efforts were made to play the game at the Czech Yacht Club, but a public struggle ensued, and rugby subsequently never really caught on.\nRugby union was only properly introduced to the country by the writer Ondřej Sekora, when he returned from living in France in 1926, with a rugby ball and set of rules. Brno, the Moravian capital is considered the cradle of rugby in Czechoslovakia, and is where the first match took place, between SK \"Moravská Slávie\", based in Brno-Pisárky, and AFK Zizka, based in Brno. Both of these teams were trained by Sekora, who also coined Czech language rugby terminology.\nCzech rugby took off after 1945, when Zdenek Bárchenék, Eduard Krützner and Bruno Kudrna, helped in games against rivals Poland and Germany\nRugby union in the Czech Republic has not been popular historically, but due to its recent international successes, it is gaining more recognition. As of April 2009, more than half of the registered players are pre-teens or teenagers. In addition, there are currently twenty-one domestic clubs that compete against each other on various levels.\nNational team.\nThe national team has been competing since the early 1990s. As of April 2009, the national team is currently competing in the European Nations Cup and is attempting to qualify for the 2011 Rugby World Cup."

The season began on 2 May at Silverstone and ended on 14 November 2009 at Zolder. The season featured six double-header rounds, with each race lasting for a duration of 60 minutes. Most of the events were support races to the 2009 FIA GT Championship season, the 2009 GT4 European Cup and the 2009 Lamborghini Super Trofeo.\nPhoenix Racing pairing Christopher Haase and Christopher Mies claimed the overall title, with a fourth place in the final race of the season at Zolder. In the Teams Championship, Hexis Racing were champions ahead of Matech Racing and Team Rosberg.\nEntries and drivers.\nTwo new manufacturers join the FIA GT3 category in 2009. Audi, with their V10-powered R8 LMS, and Alpina's B6, based on the 6-Series. The Ford Mustang FR500GT3 does not return in 2009. Ferrari replaces its previous F430 GT3 with the new 430 Scuderia GT3, while Morgan's Aero 8 is replaced by the Aero Super Sport.\nAlso new for 2009 is an alteration in the structure of teams and manufacturers. Although manufacturers will still be allowed a maximum of six cars, teams are only limited to two cars. There is therefore a maximum of three teams which can campaign a single manufacturer. The manufacturers of Ascari, Dodge, Jaguar, Lamborghini, and Morgan will not be eligible for the Manufacturers Cup due to not supplying the minimum of four cars required to enter the Cup.\n† – JMB Racing were allowed by the FIA to use a 2008 Ferrari F430 GT3 for their #14 entry at Silverstone due to not having a second 430 Scuderia GT3 prepared in time.\nChampionships.\nPoints are awarded to the top eight finishers in the order 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1. Cars which failed to complete 75% of the winner's distance are awarded half the points awarded for completing the 75% race distance.\nManufacturer Cups.\nThe Manufacturer Cups are open to any manufacturer who supplies at two or more teams in the full season.

        "text": "Ralph Gary \"Rocky\" Thompson (born November 8, 1947) is a former American football player for the New York Giants in the National Football League (NFL).\nThompson, a running back/wide receiver, played college football at Hartnell College and West Texas State, where he was the roommate of future Dallas Cowboys star Duane Thomas. Thompson was a world-class sprinter who won the AAA Championships 100 metres in 1970 with a time of 10.1 seconds, and representing Bermuda, he reached the final of the 100 metres at the 1970 British Commonwealth Games, finishing sixth.\nThe Giants drafted Thompson in the first round of the 1971 NFL Draft with the 18th overall selection. He appeared in all 28 regular-season games for the Giants in 1971 and 1972, primarily as a kickoff returner, but his NFL career was ended by a severe neck injury during play. The Giants subsequently released Thompson before the start of the 1974 season.\nShortly after Thompson was selected in the first round of the 1971 draft out of West Texas State, The New York Times reported that Rocky Thompson is listed in Bermuda and in official Brit track records as Ralph Gary Symonds. Thompson explained that his mother's maiden name was Symonds but when she remarried he took his stepfather's name of \"Thompson.\" But he competed at track under his mother's maiden name, and later as Rocky Thompson-Symonds, since his mother had also ran track for Bermuda."

        "title": "Marshall Thundering Herd men's basketball",
        "text": "The Marshall Thundering Herd men's basketball team represents Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia. They compete in the NCAA Division I as a member of the Sun Belt Conference.\nMarshall has advanced to the NCAA tournament five times through the years (their 1987 appearance having been vacated), most recently in 2018. The Thundering Herd has also played in the NIT five times, last appearing in 2012. Marshall won the NAIA National Championship in 1947, and is 7–2 all-time in the first collegiate basketball tournament, one year older than the NIT and four years older than the NCAA Tournament.\nNotable former Marshall basketball players include NBA and Marshall Hall of Famer Hal Greer, who was named as one of the NBA's 50 best players of all time. Greer was selected to 10 consecutive NBA All-Star games. Greer was named NBA All-Star Game MVP in 1968, one year after leading the Philadelphia 76ers to the NBA title. Additionally, Marshall's Andy Tonkovich was the first overall selection in the BAA (now NBA) draft in 1948. Mike D'Antoni, current coaching consultant for the New Orleans Pelicans and NBA Coach of the Year winner, played college basketball at Marshall from 1970 to 1973.\nHistory.\nCam Henderson era.\nThe legendary coach of the Thundering Herd was Cam Henderson. Henderson, acknowledged as the creator of the modern zone defense, won 358 games against just 158 losses between 1935–1955. Henderson led Marshall to three consecutive Buckeye Conference titles from 1936 to 1939, but his greatest team was the 1946–47 team. They set a Marshall school record with 32 wins in a season; a 17–0 start to the season; a 35-game home winning streak; and won the National Championship in the National Association for Intercollegiate Basketball (today's NAIA) in Kansas City in 1947, sweeping five games in six days. Marshall also played in the NAIB Tournament in 1938 and 1948, losing in the quarterfinals. His 1947–48 team won the Helms Foundation Los Angeles Invitational with a 46–44 win over Syracuse, the same year Henderson coached the Marshall football team to the second-ever Tangerine Bowl.\nAndy Tonkovich, who played on that team, was the first draft pick of the 1948 BAA draft by Providence. Center Charlie Slack set a still NCAA record of 25.6 rebounds per game for Henderson's final team in 1954–55. Tonkovich, Gene \"Goose\" James and Bill Hall were First Team NAIB All-Americans in 1947, joined by Bill Toothman on the second team and Mervin Gutshall on honorable mention, meaning all five starters were on the All-American team. Tonkovich repeated on the second team in 1948. Walt Walowac was a first team Helms Foundation Small College All-American for Henderson in 1953, and was third team on the Helms squad in 1954.\nHenderson recorded wins over such marquee programs as Syracuse, Virginia, Memphis, Virginia Tech, Pepperdine, Xavier, Dayton, Louisville (No. 19 in the nation in 1950, a 96–72 Marshall win), Indiana State (Henderson was 2–1 versus John Wooden, when the UCLA legend was coaching the Sycamores), BYU, Idaho, Hawaii, Cincinnati, Tennessee, Western Kentucky, Loyola, Maryland, Miami-Florida, Denver, St. Francis, Wichita State, Colorado, Cal, CCNY, Long Island Univ., South Carolina and St. Louis. His 1954–55 team was second in the Mid-American Conference, but was denied a berth in the NIT by the league in the wake of the cheating scandals in New York and other college spots in the early 1950s.\nPost-Henderson era (Jules Rivlin, Ellis Johnson, Carl Tacy, Bob Daniels, and Bob Zuffelato).\nHenderson's first basketball All-American, Jule Rivlin, coached the 1955–56 Herd to its only MAC title and first-ever NCAA Tournament. Rivlin's 1958 Herd led the nation in scoring, with Hal Greer and Leo Byrd, scoring 88.1 points per game and topping the Jerry West-led Mountaineers of West Virginia University who averaged 88.0 points per game. Byrd was an All-American in 1959, first team on the Chuck Taylor/Converse team and second team on UPI and Helms Foundation. Henderson and Tonkovich are both members of the Helms Foundation NAIA Hall of Fame.\nMarshall was coached to the NIT in 1967 by Ellis T. Johnson (the first All-American for legendary Kentucky coach Adolph Rupp), advancing to the semifinals thanks in part to George Stone scoring 46 points versus Nebraska in their quarterfinal game. Stone went on to play professionally for four years in the American Basketball Association (ABA). Johnson brought the Herd back to the NIT in 1968 behind point guard Dan D'Antoni, but they lost in the first round.\nCarl Tacy coached the Herd to a 23–4 season in 1971–72, losing to Southwest Louisiana, 112–101 in the NCAA Tournament. Marshall was ranked as high as No. 8 in the nation that season, and finished 12th in the nation. Russell Lee was a Converse All-American in 1972, and was selected in the first round of the ABA Draft and second round by the Milwaukee Bucks of the NBA, playing for that team for two years and three seasons overall in the NBA. Bob Daniels was the Herd coach beginning in the 1972–73 season leading the team to an appearance in the NIT. Mike D'Antoni was the point guard for the NCAA Tournament team in 1972 and the NIT team in 1973, was a CoSIDA Academic All-American both seasons and was awarded an NCAA post-graduate scholarship. He was drafted by the Kansas City-Omaha Kings and played four seasons in the NBA before moving on to greater glory in the Italian League, winning titles as a player and coach. Kobe Bryant wore No. 8 his first few seasons in the NBA because that was the number D'Antoni wore when he played with Kobe's father in Italy.\nMarshall advanced to the school's first conference title game in 1978, falling to Furman in the title game under charismatic coach Stu Aberdeen. Bob Zuffelato took the Herd to the Southern Conference finals in 1979–80, falling again to Furman, after Aberdeen died during the summer of 1979 while on vacation. The 1980–81 team saw Marshall post its first-ever win over West Virginia at the WVU Coliseum in Morgantown, West Virginia. Marshall won the first game played against WVU in Huntington in 1982–83. Marshall would go on to be 5–0 versus the Mountaineers in Huntington before the series moved permanently to the Charleston Civic Center in the state capital.\nRick Huckabay era.\nRick Huckabay led Marshall to six Southern Conference titles - three regular season ones and three conference tournament championships. His teams made three NCAA Tournaments (the 1987 appearance later vacated by the NCAA) and an NIT appearance from 1983 to 1989, although they lost all four postseason contests. John Taft and Skip Henderson were both recruited by Huckabay and are one-two in scoring at Marshall all-time. A highlight of Huckabay's time at Marshall occurred on February 7, 1985, when backup guard Bruce Morris made the longest shot in NCAA basketball history. The \"Shot Herd Round the World\" measured 89 feet, 10 inches and ended the first half. Marshall went on to defeat Appalachian State in that game, 93–82.\nPost Huckabay Era (Billy Donovan, Greg White, Donnie Jones, and Tom Herrion).\nWhen Billy Donovan was hired in 1994, he was 28 years old and the youngest head coach in NCAA Division I. Donovan helped land West Virginia native and future NBA standout Jason Williams after he had originally signed with Providence. When Donovan left to become the head coach of the University of Florida in 1996, Williams followed him to the Gators. Donovan led the Thundering Herd to the Southern Conference North division title in the 1994–95 season. He went 35–20 in two seasons at Marshall. Notable assistant coaches at Marshall under Donovan included Anthony Grant and John Pelphrey.\nKeith Veney set an NCAA record with 15 three-pointers in Marshall's Henderson Center against Morehead State University on December 14, 1996 for new head coach Greg White, who had been Marshall's point guard from 1977 to 1981. White followed in the great Marshall tradition of outstanding players from the Mullens, West Virginia area including both Mike and Dan D'Antoni. White coached his first Marshall team to its final Southern Conference tournament title game in 1996–97, falling to UT-Chattanooga on a last-second, game-winning shot. Marshall joined the Mid-American Conference for the second time in 1997–98, and the Herd was 21–9 in 1999–2000 under White, falling in the MAC semi-finals to Miami, Ohio. White's overall record at Marshall in seven seasons was 115–84.\nBefore Donnie Jones came to coach Marshall from 2007 to 2010, he was an assistant with the Florida Gators for 11 years and helped Billy Donovan coach the Gators to consecutive national championships in 2006 and 2007. Jones got Marshall to a winning record for the first time since 2001 with a 16–14 mark in his first season In 2010, Jones coached Marshall to the CIT, which was their first post-season tournament since 1988. Marshall fell to Appalachian State in the CIT quarterfinals. Following the 2010 season, and amid growing fan concern over Marshall's performance in the 2010 CUSA and CIT tournaments, Donnie Jones left Marshall to coach conference rival UCF. Considering Jones' success at Marshall and his local ties to the Huntington area, many Marshall fans considered his departure a betrayal, further fueling the Marshall-UCF rivalry.\nIn 2010, Marshall hired former College of Charleston head coach, Tom Herrion, to lead the Thundering Herd. In 2012, Herrion coached the Thundering Herd to the National Invitational Tournament for the first time since 1988. However, after back-to-back losing seasons in 2013 and 2014, Marshall bought out the remaining two years of his contract. In four seasons as head coach, Herrion's record was .500, going 67–67.\nDan D'Antoni era.\nOn April 24, 2014, Marshall University Athletic Director Mike Hamrick announced Mullens native and Los Angeles Lakers assistant coach, Dan D'Antoni, as the next head coach of the Thundering Herd.\nD'Antoni is a Marshall alum and played point guard for The Herd from 1966 to 1970. He led the team in scoring with a 17.5 scoring average in 1968–69 and led the 1967 team to the semifinals of the \nNational Invitation Tournament, losing to Marquette 83–78 and then losing to Rutgers 93–76 in the 3rd place game. In 1968, he again led the team to the NIT, losing to St. Peter's 102–93 in the first round. He is one of 49 Marshall players to score 1,000 points, tallying 1,109. In 1990, he was inducted into the Marshall University Athletic Hall of Fame.\nFor the 2017–18 season, Marshall and coach D'Antoni finished the regular season with a win and season sweep over 24th-ranked Middle Tennessee, Marshall's first win over a top-25 opponent since 2011. In the ensuing Conference USA tournament as the conference's fourth seed, Marshall dominated against UTSA and Southern Miss, before hanging on late against Western Kentucky 67–66 in the conference tournament title game. This gave Marshall its first Conference USA championship and sent the Thundering Herd to the NCAA tournament for the first time in 31 years. As the 13th seed in the East, D'Antoni also led the Thundering Herd to their first-ever NCAA Tournament victory in program history, an 81–75 win over Wichita State, the region's fourth seed, in the first round. Marshall would eventually get knocked out in the second round by a 94–71 loss to in-state rival West Virginia.\nFor the 2018–19 season, Marshall finished the regular season as the Conference USA's sixth seed and on a season-high five-game win streak. Marshall, however, was not able to repeat the previous season's success and was knocked out in the conference tournament quarterfinals to Southern Miss, before ultimately accepting an invite in the CIT for the first time since 2011. As the tournament's number one seed, Marshall was able to secure a second-round bye following its opening-round 78–73 win over IUPUI. Following quarterfinal and semifinal wins over Presbyterian and Hampton respectively, Marshall would move on to the CIT Championship game against Green Bay, which they would dominate with a 90–70 victory and secure the program's first postseason hoops title in 72 years.\nPostseason results.\nNCAA tournament results.\nMarshall has appeared in the NCAA tournament six times, although the official tally is five as their 1987 appearance was vacated due to NCAA violations. Their combined record is 1–6, or 1–5 by the official NCAA tally.\nNational Invitation Tournament results.\nMarshall has been selected to participate in five National Invitation Tournaments.

The tournament was moved to the proposed September–October dates with the tournament structure remaining as it was. It was also announced that ten French cities would be hosting games, with the final at the Stade de France. French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said that \"this decision illustrates the qualities of our country and its capacity to host major sporting events...This World Cup will be the opportunity to showcase the regions of France where the wonderful sport of rugby is deeply rooted\". French Sports Minister Jean-François Lamour said that \"The organisation of this World Cup will shine over all of France because ten French towns have the privilege of organising matches and to be in the world's spotlight.\" French cities to host games are Bordeaux, Lens, Lyon, Marseilles, Montpellier, Nantes, St. Etienne, Toulouse and Paris, and it was also announced that the final would be at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis.\nThere was a substantial increase in the overall capacity of stadiums compared to the 2003 Rugby World Cup, as the smallest venue at the 2007 tournament will be 33,900. France won the right to host the event in 2003. Three matches were played at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, two Pool B games that featured Wales and as well as a quarter-final. Two Pool C matches were held at Edinburgh's Murrayfield. Ireland were also offered to host matches at Lansdowne Road in Dublin, but had to decline the offer as construction work was scheduled to begin on the stadium.

He was selected to play in the opening game of the 1890 Home Nations Championship in a home game against Scotland. Thomas was one of five new caps, but is recorded as the 100th player to play for Wales due his surname's position alphabetically. Under the captaincy of Frank Hill, Wales lost the game 5-1, but Thomas was reselected for the next game away to England, along with Llanelli team-mate Percy Lloyd. The England game was an historic victory, which saw Wales beat their old adversary for the first time, thanks to a single try from William Stadden. Thomas didn't play in the final game of the tournament, his place taken by London Welsh's Rowley Thomas. Thomas played one final game for Wales, the final game of the 1891 Championship which saw the selectors shake up the Welsh pack, bringing in four new caps and Thomas in replacement for William Bowen. The game was played at the Llanelli home-ground Stradey Park, with the Welsh captained by Willie Thomas; the game ended in a narrow win for Wales.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

Lumsden brought the game to Scotland after watching a men's lacrosse game between the Canghuwaya Indians and the Montreal Lacrosse Club. Lumsden, in a letter written home from the White Mountains in New Hampshire dated 6 September 1884, recounted her visit to watch that match. She wrote: \"It is a wonderful game, beautiful and graceful. (I was so charmed with it that I introduced it at St Leonards.)\"\" [sic]\nOne of Lumsden's students, Rosabelle Sinclair, established the first women's lacrosse team in the United States was at the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore, Maryland.\nScotland was a founder member of the International Federation of Women's Lacrosse Associations in 1972, which merged with the International Lacrosse Federation (the former governing body for men's lacrosse) to form the Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL) in August 2008.\nPrior to the Lockerbie air disaster in December 1988, the men's game had not been represented in Scotland since the turn of the 20th century. The tragedy of Pan Am Flight 103 saw many Syracuse University students perish and on a memorial visit one year later the University's lacrosse team were surprised that there was no Scotland Men's National Team for them to compete against. The country was challenged to pull together an inaugural and bona fide team; this was achieved some eight months later and following the 1990 World Championships the men's team played their first representative match. Scotland has now played memorial games against Syracuse during visits to Lockerbie to pay their respects to those lost in the air disaster, and hope this fixture will continue into the future.\nIn 1993, Edinburgh hosted the Women's Lacrosse World Cup."

        "title": "Utah State Aggies men's basketball",
        "text": "The Utah State Aggies are a Division I men's college basketball team that plays in the Mountain West Conference, representing Utah State University. In the 17 years that former coach Stew Morrill was at the helm, Utah State had the 4th highest winning percentage in the nation at home, behind only Duke, Kansas, and Gonzaga. As of the end of the 2023–24 regular season, the Aggies have an all-time record of 1,719 wins and 1,168 losses (.595 win pct).\nHistory.\nThe first basketball team on Utah State's campus was organized in 1902 and consisted of only women. A men's team was organized in 1904, at which point the women's club fell into obscurity.\nThe Aggies enjoyed mixed success early in their history, notching sporadic NCAA tournament appearances and alternating winning in the then-smaller postseason bracket with not winning much at all. Perhaps the most notable event in Utah State basketball history occurred on February 8, 1965, with the tragic death of Wayne Estes. Estes was a 6'6\" forward for the Aggies, and was the nation's second leading scorer in 1965, behind only Rick Barry, at 33.7 ppg. He had just amassed 2,000 career points with a 48-point showing in a home victory over the University of Denver, when he stopped at the scene of a car accident in Logan. While crossing the street, Estes accidentally clipped a downed power line with his head and was electrocuted. The Los Angeles Lakers had planned on drafting him in the 1st round of the NBA draft, where he likely would have gone on to win several championships with the team. Following Estes's death, he was posthumously awarded 1st team All-American honors.\nThe men's basketball team wasn't adversely affected by the constant shuffling of conference affiliations and independent status that blighted the USU football program throughout the mid-to-late 20th century. The program, however, did endure a lengthy stint as an independent program, from 1937 to 1978—although in that period, basketball independence was not the financial and competitive obstacle that it would become in the ESPN era. All the while, it remained the most resilient and popular sport at USU, enjoying steady success for decades. During the 1960s and '70s, the Aggies spent a great deal of time in both major national polls, finishing the season in the AP Top 25 three times and in the Coaches' Poll Top 25 seven times during those two decades. USU reached the NCAA Sweet 16 in 1962, and the Elite 8 in 1970. In 2024 the Aggies ranked 19th on the Coaches' Poll.\nThe Aggies enjoy a particularly strong home-court advantage at the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum, where they were 193–13 in the Morrill era.\nDuring the 2008–09 season, USU led the nation in field goal percentage with 49.8%. In addition, they were 2nd in win/loss percentage and 5th in assist-to-turnover ratio. In 2009–10, the Aggies led the nation in 3-point percentage with an incredible 42.5%. The Aggies have spent time in the national rankings, reaching as high as #19 in the Coaches' Poll in 2003–04, and #17 in 2008–09. During the 2009–2010, the Aggies reached as high as #26, one spot out of the actual rankings, before falling back to #31 for the postseason poll. The Aggies finished the season in 2011 ranked #19 in the AP poll. In 2019, although not ranked in the preseason poll, the Aggies finished the season again ranked in the AP poll, coming in at #25. 2020, saw the Aggies ranked #17 in the preseason poll.\nUtah State has also won the Old Oquirrh Bucket nine times, including both of the last two seasons. The Bucket is the award given each year to the best college basketball team in Utah, based on records against in-state opponents.\nPost season history.\nNCAA tournament.\nUtah State is 6–25 (.194) in its NCAA tournament history. In recent years, the team has won invitations to the tournament in 1998 (under coach Larry Eustachy), 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2009 and 2010 (all under Morrill). From 1978 to 2005, Utah State was a member of the Big West Conference. In both 2006 and 2010, the Aggies received at-large bids to the tournament after losing in the WAC tournament championship game. Despite a stellar season in 2003–04 and a national top-25 ranking toward the end of the season, the Aggies did not receive an at-large tournament bid after being upset in the conference tournament, making them the last top-25 team in college basketball to be snubbed from the tournament. This decision earned the derision of coach Morrill, as the Aggies held a 25–3 record along with their ranking.\nIn 2009, USU won the WAC tournament championship game, defeating Nevada in Reno. The team went on to lose in the first round of the NCAA tournament to Marquette, 58–57. The most recent NCAA tournament success was a first-round upset over fifth-seeded Ohio State University in 2001.\nThe 2010 team received an at-large bid from the selection committee after losing in the WAC tournament final to New Mexico State. The 12th-seeded Aggies then lost their opening round game to Texas A&amp;M.\nThe Aggies would have appeared in the 2020 NCAA tournament after being champions of the 2020 Mountain West tournament, however, the NCAA tournament was cancelled amid the 2020 coronavirus outbreak.\nIn 2024, Utah State won their first NCAA Tournament game in 23 years, when they beat the TCU Horned Frogs, 88-72, in the First Round. \nNIT.\nThe Aggies have appeared in 10 National Invitation Tournaments, with a combined record of 2–10.\nCIT.\nThe Aggies appeared in one CollegeInsider.com Tournament. Their record was 4–1.\nHome-court advantage.\nUtah State plays its home games at the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum, a 10,270-seat arena on the Utah State campus. The Aggies are 453–105 (.812) at the Smith Spectrum, which has housed basketball since 1970. Previous to the building of the Spectrum, Utah State's basketball teams played at the George Nelson Fieldhouse on campus. Under head coach Craig Smith, USU was 39–4 (.910) at home. Until a surprising early-season loss in 2009, USU boasted the second-longest home win streak in the nation, behind Kansas.\nThe Smith Spectrum features seats at court level, extremely-close to the players. The university also reserves an unusually-high percentage of seats, including at court level, for its students. This has aided the USU student section in becoming one of the most notoriously loud and raucous (and clever) in the nation, with major publicity in recent years. Various sources have called the Smith Spectrum among the hardest places in the nation for opposing teams to play. In the '90s, when his teams were reaching the Final Four and competing at the highest echelons of college basketball, University of Utah coach Rick Majerus called the Smith Spectrum the toughest place in the country for his teams to play. After a February 2010 game at the Smith Spectrum, Wichita State head coach Gregg Marshall said \"Utah State has 4000 student tickets and they make some type of impression on the visiting team and it's just a party. It is one heck of a party. It's the best I've ever seen. In many, many years I've been at Duke and Kentucky and UConn and Syracuse and it's clearly the best I've ever seen in terms of atmosphere.\"\nAn unofficial newsletter entitled \"The Refraction\" was published before each game day until it was discontinued in 2011. One student fan, known as \"Wild Bill\", has also gained much renown as of late for his unique techniques to distract opposing free throw shooters. Other Utah State traditions are their \"I believe that we will win!\" chant and \"Winning team, losing team\" chant that mocks the away losing team in the last seconds of a game.\nRetired jerseys.\nThe following players have their jerseys retired, but numbers are still active. \nAwards.\nConsensus Second Team All-Americans\nThird Team All-Americans\nAP Honorable Mention All-Americans\nPerry Wallace Most Courageous Award (USBWA)\nConference Player of the Year\nFirst Team All-Conference"

        "text": "The 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs of the National Hockey League (NHL) began on April 14, 2010, after the 2009–10 NHL regular season. The Finals ended on June 9, 2010, with the Chicago Blackhawks defeating the Philadelphia Flyers in six games to win their fourth championship and their first since 1961. Blackhawks center and team captain Jonathan Toews was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoffs' most valuable player.\nThe Washington Capitals made the playoffs as the Presidents' Trophy winners with the most points (i.e. best record) during the regular season. The Detroit Red Wings increased their postseason appearance streak to nineteen seasons, the longest active streak at the time.\nThis NHL post-season was noted for the unexpected playoff successes of two teams: the Philadelphia Flyers and Montreal Canadiens, who were the seventh and eighth seeds in their conference and were tied for points. The Flyers became the third NHL team to win a seven-game series after being down 3–0 (the others being the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs and the 1975 New York Islanders). The Flyers went on to play in the Stanley Cup Finals, losing to Chicago. Meanwhile, the Canadiens became the first eighth-seeded team in NHL history to win a series against the first-seeded team after being down 3–1 in a series, when they beat the Washington Capitals in the first round. After upsetting the defending Cup champions Pittsburgh Penguins in the second round, the Canadiens became the first eighth-seeded team to compete in the Eastern Conference Final since the current playoff format was implemented in 1994. Previously, only the eighth-seeded 2006 Edmonton Oilers had accomplished a similar feat, winning the 2006 Western Conference Final. As a result of the Canadiens having the eighth seed, the Flyers became the first seventh-seed to have home-ice advantage in the conference finals since the current playoff format was instituted.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThe top eight teams in each conference qualified for the playoffs. The top three seeds in each conference were awarded to the division winners; while the five remaining spots were awarded to the highest finishers in their respective conferences.\nPlayoff bracket.\nIn each round, the highest remaining seed in each conference was matched against the lowest remaining seed. The higher-seeded team was awarded home ice advantage. In the Stanley Cup Finals, home ice was awarded to the team with the better regular season record. Each best-of-seven series followed a 2–2–1–1–1 format: the higher-seeded team played at home for games one and two (plus five and seven if necessary), and the lower-seeded team was at home for games three and four (and if necessary, game six).\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nConference quarterfinals.\nEastern Conference quarterfinals.\n(1) Washington Capitals vs. (8) Montreal Canadiens.\nThe Washington Capitals entered the playoffs as the Presidents' Trophy winner, earning the NHL's best regular season record with 121 points.

This was the first and to date only playoff meeting between these two teams. The teams split this year's four-game regular season series.\nMontreal's point difference in the series was the fifth largest point differential (33 points) for a lower-seeded team beating a higher-seeded team in playoff history. It was also the first time an eighth-seeded team came back against a number one seed after being down 3–1 in the series, and the only time until 2023 when the Florida Panthers did so against the Boston Bruins. Montreal goaltender Jaroslav Halak made 45 saves and Tomas Plekanec won game one for the Canadiens with his goal 13:19 into the first overtime period. Washington forward Nicklas Backstrom scored the overtime winner in game two and completed a hat-trick with his goal 31 seconds into the first overtime period to give Washington a 6–5 win; Andrei Kostitsyn also scored a hat-trick during this game in a losing effort for the Canadiens.

The Sabres extended the series in game five with a 4–1 victory; at the end of the game, five players were assessed penalties after an altercation including Boston captain Zdeno Chara who was given an instigator penalty. As the penalty occurred in the final five minutes of the game Chara should have been suspended for game six, but the league rescinded the instigator penalty after the game, allowing Chara to avoid suspension.

        "title": "Itchenor Sailing Club",
        "text": "Itchenor Sailing Club is a sailing club located in Chichester Harbour which was founded in 1927.\nHistory.\nWest Itchenor is situated on the prevailing wind's windward shore, in a well-protected position in the harbour. Unlike Bosham, Dell Quay and Emsworth, the village has access to water at all states of the tide. It has been a site of shipbuilding since the 18th century, providing the nation with a number of prominent warships during the Napoleonic Wars. Recreational and competitive sailing has typically taken place adjacent to the shipyard, with such events being organised and recorded by officers of the local customs house at the end of the 19th century. When the harbour's first sailing club was founded in Bosham in 1907, regatta activity moved from Itchenor Customs House to Bosham Sailing Club. The popularity of BSC grew to the extent that its committee thought it necessary to be renamed \"Bosham and Itchenor Sailing Club\" from 1918. BSC reverted to its original name in 1922.\nIn November 1927 a group of 5 sailors circulated 48 letters of invitation to join a new sailing club in Itchenor. They were led by Dr B.S. Mends, who was elected Commodore at the first AGM. 39 of the 48 invitations were accepted and a total of 68 members were elected as founder members. The meeting also established the objectives of the club:\nWith the club growing in number, it was decided in 1930 that a clubhouse be set up to accommodate its members. Upon acquiring a 17th-century fishermen's cottage overlooking the harbour, the memorandum of association was signed in the following year.\nIn 1937 ISC faced an existential threat when the Chichester Harbour Federation invited the Royal Corinthian Yacht Club to establish a South Coast branch in the harbour. Following a meeting between Commodore Thomas McMeekin and his RCYC counterpart, Tiny Mitchell, amalgamation proposals were circulated to the club membership and a referendum was announced to determine the matter. This sharply divided opinion and caused dissenting members to form a \"protesting committee.\" When McMeekin's plans were narrowly rejected, he and his Vice Commodore announced that they would not seek re-election. In an attempt to restore confidence in the club's administration, Rear Commodore Geoffrey Lowles was put forward as a \"unity candidate.\" He was proposed by William Tracy Wallace, who succeeded in uniting members to support Lowles as the new Commodore; Wallace arranged for over fifty individuals (comprising the differing cliques, factions, and recalcitrant members) to officially second him to the position.\nWith the outbreak of World War II, the sailing club was requisitioned by the British Army. An anti-aircraft gun was mounted to attack approaching \"Luftwaffe\" planes. \nRacing.\nThe Sailing Club races every weekend from April to November with midweek racing for keelboats, as well as specific weeks for class regattas. A comprehensive programme is run for keelboat classes (National Swallow, Solent Sunbeam, X-One-Designs) and jetty dinghy classes (International 14, RSK6, RS800, RS200, International 420, Topper and Mirror). Open Meetings are held for most classes, including the annual Schools Week.\nThe Mirror fleet at Itchenor is the biggest and most active fleet in the country and possibly the world comprising just over 100 boats.\nSailing events.\nJunior Fortnight.\nJunior Fortnight is an annual series of racing that takes place over a fortnight during the summer holidays. It has its own committee that oversees the running of Junior Fortnight. As well as a racing programme which consists of ten to thirteen races in all, there is a social programme. The social programme includes two bops which occur on the first and last nights of the event, a talent show, themed parties, cricket matches and a prizegiving at the end of the fortnight.\nThe fortnight series, organised and run by Itchenor Sailing Club, sees competitors from neighbouring sailing clubs in Chichester Harbour, such as Hayling Island Sailing Club, West Wittering Sailing Club, Emsworth Sailing Club, Bosham Sailing Club and others.\nSchools Week.\nSchools Week (also known as the Schools Championship) is an inter-schools sailing competition which is organised and run by Itchenor Sailing Club. It was started in 1953 under the name of 'The Public Schools Firefly Invitation Championships.' Currently the fleets include 420s, Fireflies and RS Fevas. Between 1997 and 1999 Laser Radials were introduced to the class but failed to catch on.\nCompeting schools have included Charterhouse, King's School, Canterbury, Magdalen College School, Oxford, Oundle, Portsmouth Grammar School, Sevenoaks, Sherborne, Tonbridge and Winchester College."

They finished the season 34–4 overall, won the ACC regular season title with a 14–2 record and won the 1993 national championship. They were coached by Dean Smith, who won his second national championship in his thirty-second season as head coach of the Tar Heels. They played their home games at the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.\nSeason summary.\nThe 1992-93 team was led by George Lynch, Eric Montross, Brian Reese, Donald Williams, and Derrick Phelps. The Tar Heels started out with an 8–0 record and were ranked #5 in the country when they met #6 Michigan in the semi-finals of the Rainbow Classic. The Wolverines, led by the Fab Five in their sophomore season, won 79–78 to on a last-second shot. North Carolina bounced back with nine straight wins before losing back-to-back road games against unranked Wake Forest and #5 Duke. After seven more straight wins, the Tar Heels were ranked #1 heading into the last week of the regular season (their first #1 ranking since the start of the 1987–88 season). North Carolina beat #14 Wake Forest and #6 Duke to close out the regular season and clinch the top seed in the ACC tournament. North Carolina reached the tournament final, but they lost 77–75 to Georgia Tech without Derrick Phelps who was injured. Nonetheless, North Carolina was awarded the top seed in the East Regional of the NCAA tournament, defeating #16-seed East Carolina (85–65), #8-seed Rhode Island (112-67), #4-seed Arkansas (80–74), and #2-seed Cincinnati (75–68) to reach the final four in New Orleans.\nIn the national semi-finals, Smith's Tar Heels defeated his alma mater Kansas (coached by future North Carolina coach Roy Williams) 78–68, setting up a rematch with #3-ranked Michigan in the finals.\nThe national title game was a see-saw battle throughout, but is remembered best for Chris Webber's time out call with seconds left when Michigan didn't have any. Michigan was assessed a technical foul and North Carolina ended up winning 77–71, giving Smith his second national championship.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9| ACC tournament\n!colspan=9| NCAA tournament\nTeam players drafted into the NBA.\nKevin Salvadori, Matt Wenstrom and Derrick Phelps also went on to play in the NBA, but were undrafted."

Ever since the formation of the Botswana Rugby Union in 1992, the matters of the association have always been run by a B.R.U Executive Committee made up of the President, Secretary and Treasurer who are all elected into position in the annual AGM. The executive committee was expanded in 2007 to include Vice-President and an additional member. The general committee is made up of representatives of clubs, referees and school coordinators inclusive of the executive committee. All the positions in the union are on voluntary basis.\nHistory.\nLike Rugby union in Kenya and Rugby union in Zimbabwe, Botswana Rugby has suffered from having been played mainly by the white community, and being seen as a hangover from colonial days.\nAlso, like most African nations, Rugby is mainly played in and around the capital, Gaborone.\nHowever, Botswana's proximity to the major Rugby playing nation of South Africa, and 2 time world cup competitors Zimbabwe, has meant that Botswana has received a constant flow of touring sides, and other African nations. Rugby union in South Africa is a major Sport - the country has both hosted and won the Rugby World Cup - and, Botswana is saturated by South African media of various types.

Savoie had a solid skate to finish eighth, while teammate Lysacek fell on his triple Axel and doubled his triple flip to finish a disappointing tenth in this phase of the competition.\nFree skating.\nIn the free skating, completed on February 16, Plushenko set another world record by garnering 167.67 points for his free skating. He started his program off with quad-triple-double and had only one flaw, doubling his triple flip. He finished with the highest technical and program component scores of the night.\nDespite struggling with his jumps in his free skating (completing no triple Axels), Lambiel's opening quad combination and exquisite spins kept him in second overall, though he finished only fourth in the free skating. Buttle's free skating, although marred by a fall on his quad attempt, had the second highest program components scores which helped to finish him second in the free skating and third overall. Joubert had a crowd-pleasing free skating but made several jump errors and finished a disappointing seventh in the free skating, sixth overall.\nThe Americans got off to a strong start in the free skating led by Lysacek. He skated his best free of the year and landed two triple Axels, getting 152.28 points. This was the third best free of the night and a huge improvement from his short, moving him up to fourth overall. Weir omitted his planned quad toe loop and only had one jump combination, which left him short on technical content and in sixth place in the free skating. Overall, he finished right behind Lysacek in fifth. Savoie had a solid skate, though he doubled his two final planned triples to finish fifth in the free and seventh overall.\nTakahashi skated fairly strongly in his free but was penalized in the marking for repeating too many jumps and underrotating others. He finished ninth in the free and eighth overall. Belgium's Kevin van der Perren made huge leaps in the free with 132.03 points and moving up from thirteenth in the short to ninth overall. Sandhu, on the other hand, fell apart in his free skating, falling twice and popping a couple of jumps. His high program component scores couldn't keep him in the top ten. He finished thirteenth overall."

        "title": "Figure skating at the 2006 Winter Olympics – Ice dance",
        "text": "Ice dance was contested during the figure skating events at the 2006 Winter Olympics.\nThis competition began with a compulsory dance, the Ravensburg Waltz, on February 17, in which all couples performed the same dance. The original dance, in which skaters performed to a designated set of rhythms (Latin combination), was held two days later, and the 4-minute free dance concluded the competition on February 20. 24 couples entered the competition, and all of them continued through to the free dance. Coming into the competition, Russians Tatiana Navka / Roman Kostomarov, the reigning world champions, were the clear favorites. Tanith Belbin / Benjamin Agosto, who won silver medals at the last World Championships, aimed to win the first Olympic medals in ice dance for USA since 1976. Teams from Ukraine, France, Canada, Israel, Lithuania, Italy, and Bulgaria were also vying for a medal.\nCompulsory dance.\nThere were a few surprises during the Compulsory Dance, which saw reigning world champions (undefeated this season) Navka / Kostomarov finishing second to the Italian team of Barbara Fusar-Poli / Maurizio Margaglio. The Italians, who were bronze medalists at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, decided to make a comeback at these Olympic Games and had not competed at any international events since the last Games. They edged the Russians in the technical score and tied them in program components. Bulgaria's Albena Denkova / Maxim Staviski were another surprise finishing in third after the CD, followed by Canadians Marie-France Dubreuil / Patrice Lauzon. Reigning world bronze medalists, Ukrainians Elena Grushina / Ruslan Goncharov, finished in fifth. The biggest surprise was the sixth-place finish of Belbin / Agosto, who were originally seen as the main pair who could really challenge the Russian domination of Navka / Kostomarov. The French team of Isabelle Delobel / Olivier Schoenfelder follow, while another team making a comeback, Lithuanians Margarita Drobiazko / Povilas Vanagas, who finished third at the 2006 European Championships, sit in eighth. The Israeli team of Galit Chait / Sergei Sakhnovski found themselves in thirteenth after a fall during a step sequence. The Italian leaders and sixth placed Tanith Belbin / Ben Agosto were separated by just over a point, so the Americans could easily make up that difference.\nOriginal dance.\nIn the second portion of the dance competition, mistakes prevailed. Navka / Kostomarov did not seem to be affected by this and gave a solid performance to finish first in this portion and overall. Belbin / Agosto gave a crowd-pleasing performance which was placed second by the judges, putting them just over 1 point behind the Russians overall.\nCD leaders Fusar-Poli / Margaglio had a very disappointing skate with Margaglio losing his balance causing both to fall. They finished tenth in the OD, keeping them well out of contention for a gold medal with Navka / Kostomarov almost 10 points ahead of them. At the end of the performance, Fusar-Poli gave her partner a withering glare and broke down in tears in the \"kiss and cry\" area just offstage. They were seventh overall heading into the free dance.\nGrushina / Goncharov were good enough to finish third in the OD and overall, while Delobel / Schoenfelder were right behind. Despite troubles on their combination spin, Denkova / Staviski were able to land in the top five. Chait / Sakhnovski finished sixth in the OD and ninth overall, followed by Dubreuil / Lauzon who received a 2-point deduction for a painful fall that required Lauzon to carry his partner off the ice. Drobiazko / Vanagas also received deductions for a fall and for holding a lift for too long.\nFree dance.\nDubreuil / Lauzon announced they would withdraw from the free dance portion of the competition after Dubreuil's nasty fall on a rotational lift in the original dance, leaving them out of medal contention. Dubreuil had fallen on her right hip during the original dance, leaving her too badly injured to compete effectively.\nNavka / Kostomarov were clearly in a class above their competition. Skating their passionate dance to Carmen, the Russian favorites received the highest technical and program components scores. Finishing behind them in the free dance and fourth overall were Delobel / Schoenfelder, with strong elements as well. Bronze medalists Grushina / Goncharov finished third in the free dance with a clean, yet slow skate. Belbin / Agosto captured the audience's attention with a powerful and exciting skate as they danced to flamenco music, but made tiny mistakes in their final twizzles and step sequence. This put them in fourth for the free dance but second overall. Their silver medal is the first for the Americans in 30 years. Fifth in the free and overall, Denkova / Staviski had strong technical content, but lost two points because of extending one of their lifts. Drobiazko / Vanagas finished sixth in the free, followed by Chait / Sakhnovski, skating to the classic dance music Bolero. Fusar-Poli / Margaglio finished eighth in the free with a solid program, but the most memorable moment of their skate was at the end, when Fusar-Poli fell to her knees in tears, forgiving her partner for the fall in the OD.\nResults.\nFinal standings.\nReferee:\nTechnical Controller:\nTechnical Specialist:\nAssistant Technical Specialist:\nJudges (CD):\nJudges (OD):\nJudges (FD):"

        "title": "Figure skating at the 2006 Winter Olympics – Ladies' singles",
        "text": "Ladies' single skating was contested during the figure skating events at the 2006 Winter Olympics.\nThis individual event was structured in a similar manner to the pairs event, with a short program and a free skating. 30 skaters entered the short program, but only the top 24 competitors continued to the free skating. Unlike the men's event, the free skating is only 4 minutes long. The short program was held on February 21 and the free skating on February 23.\nThe leading contender heading into the Olympics was 2005 World champion Russia's Irina Slutskaya, the first woman to win the European Championship seven times. Prior to the Olympic Games, she had only been beaten once this season, by Japan's Mao Asada, who was too young to compete at these Olympics.\nFavorite Michelle Kwan, who had previously won silver at the 1998 Winter Olympics and bronze at the 2002 Winter Olympics, was forced to withdraw due to a groin injury. As a 5-time world champion and 9-time U.S. champion, the Olympic gold was the only major title missing from her resume. U.S. national bronze medalist Emily Hughes (the younger sister of the last Olympic champion Sarah Hughes) took her place on the American team, joining two-time world silver medalist and U.S. national champion Sasha Cohen and U.S. national silver medalist Kimmie Meissner, the second American woman to land the triple Axel in competition.\nJapan also sent a very strong ladies contingent to Turin with 2004 world champion Shizuka Arakawa, two-time world bronze medalist Fumie Suguri and two-time Japanese national champion Miki Ando. Other potential medal contenders included Russia's Elena Sokolova, who won world silver in 2003; two-time Canadian champion Joannie Rochette; 2005 world bronze medalist Carolina Kostner; 2005 European silver medalist Susanna Pöykiö; five-time Swiss champion Sarah Meier; 2005 European bronze medalist Elena Liashenko; and 2004 European champion Júlia Sebestyén.\nArakawa made history by winning Japan's first ever ladies' figure skating gold in the Winter Olympics and the only medal for Japan at the 2006 Winter Olympics.\nShort program.\nSkating last in the short, Cohen wowed the crowd and the judges with a flawless program. Completing her three jump elements and having the best spins and spirals of the night, Cohen came in first place. Slutskaya, beating Cohen technically but not artistically, finished behind Cohen by just 0.03 points. Arakawa also had a clean skate, finished behind Slutskaya by only 0.70 points. With the top three being so close, the winner of the free would likely win the gold.\nSuguri had a strong skate but a lack of level 4 spins and spirals kept her out of the top three. Meissner, the second skater in the short and finishing fifth in the short, skated cleanly in her first major international event with a triple Lutz - triple toe combination, one of the few landed in the competition. The surprise in the top six was Georgia's Elene Gedevanishvili, who performed a triple flip - triple toe combination.\nBesides a slight stumble in her serpentine steps, Hughes also had a strong debut at her first major international event, finishing seventh in the short. Her sister Sarah was in the stands cheering her on. Rounding out the top ten was Ando, stepping out of her combination; Rochette, putting her hand down on the triple flip; and Sarah Meier, who skated a clean program. Kostner fell on her triple flip combination and finished just out of the top ten but had strong program component marks and the support of the crowd. Skating early in the competition, Sokolova took herself out of the running for a medal when she fell out of her Lutz and singled a loop. She finished 18th in the short.\nFree skating.\nArakawa, despite media pressure and being labeled an underdog, performed a five triple jump program which was enough to win the gold medal. Skating right after Cohen, Arakawa's skating was conservative but solid, no triple - triple combinations. She ended up doubling her loop jump, her nemesis jump. Skating with elegance and power, Arakawa had the highest technical and program component scores of the night.\nCohen, looking much more nervous than in the short and having her groin wrapped due to an injury, fell on her opening triple Lutz, then stepped out of the triple flip with her hand down, her next jump. Despite these early mistakes, Cohen was able to pull herself together and land the rest of her jumps and execute her trademark spins and spirals. Her only other flaw in the skate was two-footing the second jump of her triple toe - triple salchow sequence.\nSlutskaya, skating last in the free like she did in 2002, was trying to become the first Russian woman to win the Olympic title. However, she came up short, doubling a flip, then falling on a triple loop. Her lower technical difficulty (only four triple jumps) and lower program component scores kept Slutskaya behind Cohen but ahead of Suguri.\nSuguri had a solid skate that left her in tears and placed her fourth overall. Technically, she scored higher than Slutskaya despite having two jump combinations that were doubles, but finished behind her in program components. Rochette had one of the best skates of the night, completing six clean triples, the most of the top ladies during the free skating. Combined with strong choreography, Rochette's skate was able to move her up to fifth in the free and overall. Meissner was unable to complete her triple - triple combinations in the free and fell to sixth overall, while Hughes finished in seventh, despite a fall on the triple loop. Despite not accomplishing what American teens Tara Lipinski and Sarah Hughes did before them (winning Olympic gold), Meissner and Hughes had respectable debuts at the Olympics, and ostensibly Lipinski and the elder Hughes had already medalled at major international competitions while Meissner and the younger Hughes had not.\nMeier finished eighth with a relatively clean skate but singled an Axel and doubled a Lutz jump. Kostner finished ninth overall after making major mistakes. Gedevanishvilli's program was marred by mistakes, but she was able to finish in the top ten.\nResults.\nFinal standings.\nReferee:\nTechnical Controller:\nTechnical Specialist:\nAssistant Technical Specialist:\nJudges:"

        "text": "The 2008–09 Big East Conference men's basketball season was the 30th in conference history, and involved its 16 full-time member schools. Leading up to, during, and following the season, it has been widely regarded as one of the most successful seasons in Big East Conference history, fielding multiple teams that received national recognition and achieved high levels of success.\nLouisville won the outright championship with a 16-2 record (1st). They were also champions of the Big East tournament (1st).\nRegular season.\nRankings.\nThe Big East set a record when it placed seven teams in the preseason Associated Press poll. It set another record by placing eight teams in the December 1st ranking, and broke that record when the ninth team entered the AP Top 25 on January 5. Connecticut and North Carolina were the only two teams that did not vacate the top 5 in the AP poll all season.\nPostseason.\nBig East tournament.\nFor the first time ever, all 16 teams in the conference would have the chance to participate in the Big East tournament. Under this new format, the teams finishing 9 through 16 in the regular season standings played first round games, while teams 5 through 8 received a bye to the second round. The top 4 teams during the regular season received a bye to the quarterfinals. The five-round tournament spanned five consecutive days, from Tuesday, March 10, 2009, through Saturday, March 14, 2009. A low-seeded team could have theoretically played all five days if it won its games in the first four rounds, but this did not turn out to be the case.\n1–4 Seeding:\n(1) Louisville, (2) Pittsburgh, (3) Connecticut, (4) Villanova\n5–8 Seeding:\n(5) Marquette, (6) Syracuse, (7) West Virginia, (8) Providence\n9–16 Seeding and First Round Matchups:\n(16) DePaul def.

(6) Syracuse, 76–66\nThe most notable game of the tournament was the third round matchup between Connecticut and Syracuse. A back-and-forth thriller between two rivals, this game lasted nearly four hours and finally ended after six overtimes, at 1:22 a.m. the following day. The game was tied at 71–71 with a second left in regulation, when Syracuse inbounded a pass the full length of the court. Guard, Eric Devendorf, sunk a 3-point shot as the clock appeared to run out, seemingly giving Syracuse the game. After a thorough review by officials using frame-by-frame slow motion, it became apparent that the ball was not completely off of Devendorf's fingertips as the clock changed from 0.1 to 0.0 seconds. The game headed to overtime. During overtime, UConn took a lead and maintained it, until Syracuse finally tied the score to force another overtime. This pattern continued for five overtimes, where in each one, UConn took and maintained a lead, only to have Syracuse tie the score before time ran out. In the sixth and final overtime, Syracuse came out and took a large lead (their first since regulation) that eventually proved insurmountable for UConn, and won the game, 127–117. The game produced a few records when it came to duration, including longest Big East game in history. A.J. Price of Connecticut, and Jonny Flynn and Eric Devendorf of Syracuse, each played over 60 minutes, with another three Connecticut players and one Syracuse player playing over 50 minutes. Between the two teams, nine players had double-figure point totals, and five UConn players had double-figure rebound totals. With over 100 points scored in the overtime periods alone, this game was dubbed an \"Instant Classic\" and was given the title \"The Game That Wouldn't End.\"\nIn the following round, Syracuse again found itself in overtime, this time against West Virginia. Syracuse came out the winner, but would lose the following night to Louisville. This was Louisville's first Big East tournament championship. Jonny Flynn was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, becoming only the 4th player in the 30 year history of the tournament to win the award while playing on the losing team.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe Big East posted a very strong showing in the NCAA tournament. Though Notre Dame, Georgetown, and Providence were unable to secure at-large bids, seven conference teams were undisputedly deserving and were selected. The Big Ten and the Atlantic Coast Conference also sent seven teams each, which was one short of the record of eight that the Big East sent in 2006 and 2008. The conference set a record by earning three #1 seeds among the four available. Connecticut, Louisville, and Pittsburgh were all the top seeds in their regions, with North Carolina being the fourth. The conference set another record by having five teams make it to the Sweet-16, and then an additional record by having four teams make it to the Elite Eight. Connecticut and Villanova each advanced to the Final Four. This was Villanova's fourth Final Four appearance (though one was vacated for violations) and first since 1985. This was UConn's third Final Four appearance, with all coming since 1999, and all happening to come from the West region. The conference finished with a combined record of 17–7.\nNational Invitation Tournament.\nIn the 72nd annual National Invitation Tournament, there were three Big East teams among the field of 32: Georgetown, Notre Dame, and Providence.\nCollege Basketball Invitational.\nIn the 16-team College Basketball Invitational, the lone Big East representative was St. John's. The team earned a 4-seed in the East region, and lost their opening round game to top-seeded Richmond 75–69.\nAwards and honors.\nThe following players were honored with postseason awards after having been voted for by Big East Conference coaches.\nCo-Players of the Year:\nDefensive Player of the Year: \nRookie of the Year:\nMost Improved Player:\nSixth Man Award:\nSportsmanship Award:\nScholar-Athlete of the Year:\nCoach of the Year:\nAll-Big East First Team:\nAll-Big East Second Team:\nAll-Big East Third Team:\nBig East Honorable Mention:\nBig East All-Rookie Team:\nThe following players were selected to the 2009 Associated Press All-America teams.\nFirst Team All-America:\nSecond Team All-America:\nThird Team All-America:"

        "text": "The Ferris State Bulldogs men's ice hockey team is an NCAA Division I college ice hockey program that represents Ferris State University. The Bulldogs are a member of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA). They play at Ewigleben Arena in Big Rapids, Michigan.\nHistory.\nFerris State's ice hockey program began in 1975 as a member of the NAIA and joined the CCHA as an affiliate member. In the program's four seasons in the NAIA the team compiled an overall record of 58-40-1-.591, including three seasons above .700 winning percentage and a program best winning percentage of .795 in the 1976–77 season. The program moved up to NCAA Division I status and became a full member of the CCHA in 1979. They joined the WCHA in 2013 before returning to the CCHA prior to the 2021–22 season.\nFerris State turned in its best season performance ever in the program's NCAA Division I history for the 2002-03 campaign with a school-best 31-10-1 overall record. The Ferris Bulldogs also claimed their first-ever CCHA Regular-Season Championship title with a first-place 22-5-1 league mark. Ferris State received an at-large bid to the 2003 NCAA Tournament and beat North Dakota 5-2 and advanced to the West Regional title game in their initial NCAA Tourney appearance, before losing a high scoring game to Minnesota 4–7. FSU also earned the distinction of being the nation's first team to reach the 30-win plateau in 2002-03 and also competed in the CCHA Super Six Championship Tourney for the first time since 1993.\nThe 2011–12 season was historic for the Ferris State ice hockey program. The Bulldogs began the season on a six-game win streak, their best start to a season since 1979-80 when The Bulldogs recorded an eight-game streak. The team ended the regular season with their first CCHA Regular Season Championship since the program's first in 2002–03. The season was highlighted by a 14-game unbeaten streak from January 6, 2012, to February 25 in which the team recorded 11 wins and 4 ties. The Bulldogs were also ranked first in the NCAA men's ice hockey poll for a two-week period in the season for the first time in school history. After the team finished with the top record in the CCHA, the Bulldogs received a first round bye for the 2012 CCHA Tournament. Ferris State played Bowling Green in the second round, after the Falcons upset Northern Michigan. In the best-of-three series, the Falcons picked up a win in overtime in the opening game followed by goal outburst in the second game that saw Ferris State even the series with a 7–4 win. In the final game of the series, Ferris State was unable to hold on to a three-goal lead as BGSU rallied back to force overtime. \nThe Falcons scored in the extra period to win the CCHA quarterfinal series. Despite the loss in the CCHA playoffs, the Bulldogs received an at-large bid to the 2012 NCAA Tournament. Ferris State defeated Denver and Cornell in the first two rounds of the tournament with a pair of 2-1 games. In the program's first appearance in the Frozen Four, the Bulldogs defeated Union 3-1 and advanced to the championship game against Boston College.

        "text": "The Lake Superior State Lakers men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents Lake Superior State University. The Lakers are a member of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA). They play at the Taffy Abel Arena in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.\nHistory.\nNAIA years.\nThe Lake Superior State men's ice hockey program began in 1966 as a member of the NAIA, under coach Ron Mason. The Lakers won the first program game with a 7-0 shutout of the VFW Chippewas. The shutout and win streak continued through the team's second ever game when Lake Superior State College won 2-0 against the Sault (Ont.) Rapids. The Lakers finished their inaugural season 15-5-0.\nThe Lakers joined the International Collegiate Hockey Association (ICHA) its second season and stayed in the league through the 1973-74 season. The Lakers swept their first league series in program history with two high scoring games against Lakehead, winning 9-4 on November 18, 1967 and 8-6 the following night. The pattern continued as Lake Superior swept through the regular season and advanced to the programs first ever post-season tournament appearance in the 1968 NAIA Ice Hockey Tournament. The Lakers won their first ever playoff game in deciding fashion 7-1 over Gustavus Adolphus College. Lake Superior's run was ended in the 1968 NAIA Championship game when they lost to Bemidji State 4-5. History repeated itself the following season when Lake Superior again fell to Bemidji in the 1969 NAIA Championship 5-6. The Lakers finished the season with a record of 21-5-1, the only losses on the season coming at the hands of the Beavers.\nIn the 1969-70 season Lake Superior again advanced through the ICHA regular season and the ICHA to the 1970 NAIA Tournament. Lake Superior advanced to the championship game against Bemidji State for the third straight season with a dominating 22-3 win over Alaska Methodist. The Lakers fell to Bemidji State 4-7, the third straight loss to Bemidji State in the NAIA Championship game.\nThe 1970-71 season marked the first season since the inaugural 1966-67 season that the Lakers failed to make the NAIA tournament, finishing the season with a record of 13-9-4. The Lakers joined the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) as one of the founding members of the league in 1971 and began play in the CCHA for the 1972-73 season. Lake Superior also remained in the ICHA and NAIA. The Lakers picked up their first CCHA victory on November 4, 1972 when they beat Saint Louis University 7-3. The team qualified for the NAIA Championship Tournament after not receiving a bid in the past season. The Lakers defeated Wisconsin State 12-2 and defeated Gustavus Adolphus 9-3 to win the program's first ever National Championship. Lake Superior fell to Lakehead in the 1973 NAIA Championship Tournament, marking the Lakers first post season loss not in the Championship game, but rebounded the next day with an 11-3 win over Gustavus Adolphus for the NAIA Third Place game. Following the 1972-73 season Ron Mason left to become the head coach at Bowling Green, Mason was replaced by Rick Comley.\nThe 1973-74 season marked a historic year for the Lakers ice hockey program. Lake Superior State finished the regular season and qualified for the 1974 NAIA Championship Tournament. The Lakers advanced to the NAIA Final Four with a 7-1 victory over Concordia College (MN), then picked up a deciding 9-2 win over St. Thomas to advance into the NAIA Championship against rival Bemidji State. The Lakers won their second NAIA Championship with a 4-1 victory over the Beavers. The championship was not the end of the season, as the Lakers also received a bid to the CCHA Tournament. Lake Superior won their first ever CCHA playoff game against Western Michigan but fell in the CCHA Championship to Saint Louis 3-8. The Lakers also advanced to the National Invitational Tournament held in Saint Louis, Missouri but fell 2-3 to Vermont and 1-9 to CCHA rival Saint Louis. The 1973-74 also marked Lake Superiors last season as a member of the NAIA for ice hockey.\nChampionship era.\nFrank Anzalone took over mid-season in 1983 after a period of mediocrity over the previous several seasons. Under Anzalone LSSU would turn around from an 11th-place CCHA finish to second in the CCHA two seasons later in 1984-85. The Lakers advanced to the CCHA Championship with a win over Bowling Green but lost to Michigan State 5-1 at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan. Despite the second place CCHA finish LSSU qualified for the 1985 NCAA tournament, the school's first ever NCAA Tournament appearance for ice hockey. Lake Superior fell to Rensselaer 7-3 in the first of the three game series and came up short with a 3-3 tie in the second game. RPI would go on in the tournament to become the National Champions.\nTwo seasons later in the 1987-88 season Anzalone led the Lakers to the teams' first 30-win season. Lake Superior State won the CCHA Regular Season Champions but finished as the CCHA Tournament Runner-Up with a 5-3 loss to Bowling Green. Lake State advanced to the NCAA Tournament and outscored Merrimack by a combined score of 9-3 in two games and advanced to the Frozen Four against Maine. The Lakers came away with a 6-3 win, giving LSSU their first ever appearance in the NCAA Championship game. Lake Superior took on St. Lawrence in the championship and won their first NCAA National Championship, thanks to Mark Vermette's goal that gave the Lakers a 4-3 overtime win. Laker Goalie Bruce Hoffort was named the Most Outstanding Player of the 1988 Frozen Four. Lake Superior State University is the smallest school in NCAA history to win a Division 1 national championship.\nLake Superior received at-large bids the following two season in 1989 and 1990 but championship hopes ended in the first round with back-to-back first round losses at the hands of Harvard and Colgate.\nFollowing the 1989-90 season and the NCAA First Round loss to Colgate, Anzalone left to coach the Newmarket Saints of the AHL and later other minor league professional teams. Jeff Jackson took over the program and continued the winning tradition of the Lakers. In his first season as head coach at Lake Superior Jackson led the team to a CCHA Regular Season Championship and CCHA Tournament Championship through a tough 6-5 OT win over Michigan. The CCHA Championship gave Lake Superior an automatic bid to the 1991 NCAA Tournament where the team would lose 2 games to 1 of a three-game first round series against Clarkson.\nIn Jackson's second season, the 1991-1992 Lakers would finish 20-8-4 in the CCHA, good enough for 2nd in the final standings behind Michigan. The Lakers swept Illinois-Chicago in a 2-0 sweep in the Soo to advance to Detroit, Michigan for the CCHA Finals. After knocking off Michigan State 5-3, the Lakers would win their second straight CCHA Playoff Championship, in a rematch of the previous season with a 3-1 win over Michigan. Lake Superior advanced through the NCAA Tournament with wins over Alaska-Anchorage, Minnesota and CCHA and in-state rival Michigan State. Lake Superior won their second NCAA Championship with a 5-3 win over Wisconsin.\nThe 1992-1993 Lakers went 32-8-5, 20-5-5 in the CCHA (3rd place). In the CCHA playoffs, the Lakers swept Illinois-Chicago in a best 2-out-of-3 series in the Soo behind Rob Valicevic's 4 goals. In Detroit, the Lakers destroyed Bowling Green 7-1, again paced by Valicevic's hat-trick. In the semifinals, the Lakers and Wolverines would square off. Behind Wayne Strachan's hat-trick and 19-saves by Blaine Lacher, the Lakers knocked off Michigan, 5-3. The Lakers would win the CCHA Title for a third straight season with a 3-0 shutout of CCHA Regular Season Champion Miami (OH), and advanced to the NCAA Tournament. In the West Regional in Detroit, the Lakers would open up with Minnesota-Duluth. With the game tied a 1-1, the Lakers' Brian Rolston scored two goals in 59-seconds to give LSSU the lead for good in a 4-3 victory. The win over Minnesota-Dultuth sent the Lakers their second straight Frozen Four. In the national semi-final, played in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the Lakers faced off with perennial powerhouse, Boston University. The Lakers jumped out to a 2-0 first period lead behind goals by Kurt Miller and Brian Rolston. The Lakers would not look back and would knock-off the Terriers 6-1, while Maine defeated fellow-CCHA rival Michigan, 4-3 in overtime. In the 1993 NCAA Championship game, the Lakers would face the Maine Black Bears, led by future NHL star Paul Kariya and Maine's all-time leading scorer Jim Montgomery. Maine's Patrice Tardif and Chris Ferraro gave Maine a 2-1 lead after the first period. The Lakers roared back in the second period with goals from Clayton Beddoes, John Hendry, and Wayne Strachan to take a 4-2 lead after two periods. However, Montgomery's natural hat-trick in the 3rd period lead the Black Bears to a 5-4 lead. Lake Superior State's Sean Tallaire says he scored to tie the game 5-5 with 50 seconds left, and his coach, Jeff Jackson, recounts that Tallaire returned to the team's bench and exclaimed, \"That puck was in, Coach!\" The NCAA did not yet have video review, and the game's official result ended with Maine leading 5-4. Jackson would later obtain film from the game and said that \"Every time I watched the clip, I noticed something was weird. So I kept on rewinding it back on the old VHS systems and trying to determine. You couldn’t see the puck go in the net. But what I did see was the skate lace tying down the water bottle on the top of the net, flying in the air. That’s when I knew the puck had gone in.” Later, high quality film of this moment was broadcast during a November 1993 game involving Lake Superior State and Vermont that appears to show it was indeed a goal scored by Tallaire to tie the 1993 championship game. Curiously, the NCAA actually sent Jeff Jackson a commemorative award plaque bestowing Lake Superior State University as the 1993 Men's Ice Hockey National Champions. Jackson believes this was possibly due to sanctions that the Maine hockey program received in 1993 for recruiting violations. Brian Rolston and Michael Smith were named to the all-tournament team.\nThe 1993-1994 season began as a potential rebuilding season for Coach Jackson and the Lakers. With a line-up that included 12 freshman, very few people outside of Sault Ste. Marie expected the Lakers to make a third straight trip to the Frozen Four. However, the Lakers put together a 31-10-4regular season, and a 2nd place CCHA finish with an 18-8-4 record. Lake Superior State lost the 1994 CCHA Championship game 3-0 to the Michigan Wolverines, but the Lakers' received an at-large bid to the 1994 Tournament. The underdog Lakers would play in the West Regional in East Lansing, Michigan. In the opener, the Lakers played in one of the most controversial NCAA regional games in history against Northeastern. Late in the 3rd period, and the game deadlocked at 5-5, Northeastern's Dan Lupo appeared the give the Huskies a 6-5 lead. However, the officials ruled that the entire puck had not crossed the goal line, thus negating the potential go ahead goal. The Lakers won the game, 6-5, with an overtime winner just 15-seconds into the extra frame. In the second game of the NCAA Regional, the Lakers again matched up with the Michigan Wolverines, a team who had won both the CCHA Regular Season and Playoff Championships and had beaten the Lakers four times during the season. The Lakers and Wolverines would play to a 4-4 score at the end of regulation, with the Lakers upsetting Michigan with an overtime goal 5-4. In the national semi-finals, played in St.Paul, Minnesota, the Lakers again won in overtime, this time beating Harvard, 3-2. The streak of overtime games was snapped in St. Paul, Minnesota when the Lakers exploded to a 9-1 win over Boston University to win the program's third NCAA Division I Men's Hockey Title.\nJeff Jackson would coach the Lakers for two more seasons, making the NCAA Tournament in both 1995 and 1996. The team would lose in Regional Final games both seasons against Boston University in a rematch of the 1994 Championship and to Vermont in 1996. The Lakers would not advance to the NCAA Tournament again for 25 years. Jackson stepped down as head coach of Lake Superior to become the national coach and senior director of the newly founded U.S. National Team Development Program in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Anzalone and Jackson combined to lead to the program to an impressive run, Lake Superior appeared in the NCAA Tournament for nine consecutive seasons. Those nine seasons included three NCAA Division I Championships and one runner-up spot.\nPost-championship era.\nLake Superior returned to a cool period after Jackson left the program. After five lacklustre seasons under Scott Borek, Frank Anzalone returned to the program in 2001 but hopes that the program would be turned around to its former glory faded after four seasons where the Lakers failed to reach the 10-win mark. Former Laker Jim Roque became coach in 2005 and, in his second season, led the Lakers to the team's first 20-win season since 1996. However, in 2014, after obtaining only three winning seasons in nine years, Roque was let go.\nIn 2010 the university announced a $5 million project to renovate and expand the James Norris Center, the athletic and recreational facility that houses the Taffy Abel Arena. The renovations will include expansion of areas around the LSSU Hockey locker room. With expanded coaches offices and spaces, a training room, equipment room, and athletic training offices.\nIn the summer of 2011, the Big Ten Conference announced intentions to begin sponsoring men's ice hockey in 2013, followed by Miami (OH) announcing the formation of the National Collegiate Hockey Conference for 2013 with and five other schools breaking from the WCHA. The realignment continued on July 20, 2011, when Northern Michigan was approved for membership in the WCHA beginning with the 2013-2014 season. On August 23, 2011 members of the WCHA and CCHA met in Chicago, Illinois in reaction to the 2011 college hockey realignment. The WCHA then sent invitations to the five remaining CCHA schools. The Lakers quickly accepted their invitation to join the conference for the 2013-14 season, followed by several other CCHA members.\nReturn to glory.\nDamon Whitten was named the 10th head coach of the Lakers in April 2014. In 2018-19, Whitten's fifth season as LSSU's coach, the Lakers won 23 games, which was Lake State's first season with over 20 wins since 2006-07 and the most wins the program had seen in a single season since 1995-96. Whitten also guided the Lakers to their first ever Great Lakes Invitational championship in program history on New Year's Eve in 2018.\nIn 2019, Lake Superior State was one of seven members of the men's WCHA that announced that they would leave after the 2020–21 season to form a new conference. In February 2020, the schools announced that their new league would be a revived CCHA.\nIn the 2020–21 season, the last for the men's WCHA, Whitten's Lakers finished second in the regular season of the WCHA, the school's best conference performance since 1995-96, and won the 2021 WCHA tournament, the program's first WCHA championship since joining the league in 2013. As the winner of the WCHA tournament, the Lakers secured an automatic bid to the 2021 NCAA tournament, ending a 25-year absence from the national tournament and earning their 11th appearance all-time.\nThe Lakers also reached a milestone of 1,000 wins in program history in March 2021.\nAwards and honors.\nUS Hockey Hall of Fame.\nUnited States Hockey Hall of Fame members include:\nNCAA.\nSpencer Penrose Award\nTournament Most Outstanding Player\nAHCA First Team All-Americans\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nWCHA.\nIndividual awards.\nRookie of the Year\nMost Outstanding Player in Tournament\nAll-Conference Teams.\nFirst Team All-WCHA\nSecond team all-wcha\nThird Team All-WCHA\nWCHA All-Rookie Team\nCCHA.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nCoach of the Year\nTerry Flanagan Memorial Award\nBest Defensive Forward\nBest Offensive Defenseman\nBest Defensive Defenseman\nTournament Most Valuable Player\nPerani Cup\nIlitch Humanitarian Award\nAll-Conference Teams.\nFirst Team All-CCHA\nSecond team all-ccha\nCCHA All-Rookie Team\nStatistical leaders.\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nLake Superior State Athletic Hall of Fame.\nThe following is a list of people associated with the Lake Superior State men's ice hockey program who were elected into the Lake Superior State Athletic Hall of Fame (induction date in parentheses).\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of Lake Superior State alumni were a part of an Olympic team.\nMedia.\nAll Lake Superior State Lakers hockey games are currently carried on local top 40 radio station WYSS.

        "text": "The Western Michigan Broncos men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents Western Michigan University. The Broncos are a member of the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC). They play at Lawson Arena in Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States.\nHistory.\nThe Broncos program began in 1973 and joined the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) for the 1975–76 season. After ten seasons in the league Western Michigan won the 1986 CCHA Playoff Tournament and advanced to the school's first NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament in 1986. The 1986 season marked the program's first CCHA Tournament Championship and the program's first bid to the NCAA Tournament. The Broncos entered the tournament in the West Regional against Harvard and lost the two-game aggregate series, being outscored 11–4 by the Crimson.\nWestern Michigan's next post season appearance came in 1994. Western Michigan received an at-large bid to the 1994 NCAA Division I Tournament and again fell in the first round with a 6–3 loss to Wisconsin.\nThe Broncos rebounded in the 1995–96 season after a sub-.500 season in 1994–95. Western Michigan received the program's second at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament. Western Michigan lost again in the first round to Clarkson 6–1.\nUnder first-year coach Jeff Blashill, Western Michigan received an at-large bid to the 2011 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament, where they would lose their opening game 3–2 in double overtime to Denver. Denver scored two goals in the last 4:29 of the third period to force overtime.\nIn 2011–12, for the second consecutive season, Western Michigan had a new head coach and reached the NCAA tournament. Longtime National Hockey League (NHL) coach Andy Murray was named as coach of the Broncos after Blashill left for the Detroit Red Wings. WMU finished tied for second in the CCHA and won the CCHA tournament, thereby receiving an automatic bid into the NCAA tournament. Western Michigan lost in the first round of the tournament 3–1 to No. 1 seed North Dakota.\nThe Broncos joined the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC) starting in the 2013–14 season. The CCHA disbanded after the 2012–13 season, in part due to the addition of men's ice hockey to the Big Ten Conference.\nWestern Michigan won the 2013 four-team Great Lakes Invitational which was played outdoors at Comerica Park in Detroit. The Broncos defeated No. 3 Michigan 3–2 in overtime in the semifinals, and then claimed the championship by beating Michigan Tech 1–0, also in overtime. WMU won the 2014 Shillelagh Tournament with an 8–2 victory over No. 17 Union. The Broncos also defeated Ohio State in the first round of the tournament, 6–2.\nIn 2016–17, the Broncos followed up a disappointing 8-25-3 season with an impressive 22-13-5 and a third-place finish in the NCHC. Western Michigan was invited to the final Great Lakes Invitational at Joe Louis Arena, where they defeated Michigan Tech in the championship. WMU has been invited to the GLI 5 times dating back to 1977, winning it 3 of those times. The Broncos were defeated in the first round of the 2017 NCAA Division I tournament by Air Force.\nIn 2021-2022, Western Michigan had a legendary season for the program under Pat Ferschweiler as head coach.

        "text": "The Ohio State Buckeyes men's ice hockey team is an NCAA Division I college ice hockey program that represents Ohio State University. The Buckeyes are a member of the Big Ten Conference. They play at Value City Arena in Columbus, Ohio.\nHistory.\nThe Ohio State Buckeyes men's ice hockey program began in 1963, the team played at the new Ohio State Ice Rink, constructed in 1961. The Buckeyes were a founding member of the CCHA in 1971. The Buckeyes won the inaugural 1972 CCHA men's ice hockey tournament with a 3–0 win over Saint Louis University.\nOne of the team's most successful seasons came in 1997–1998, the year before the Buckeyes moved into new the 17,500-seat Value City Arena, which replaced the aging and undersized (1,400-seat) Ohio State Ice Rink. The team finished the 1997–1998 season with an overall record of 27–13–2. They secured an at-large bid to the 1998 tournament. That same season the Buckeyes advanced to the 1998 Frozen Four and lost in the semifinal game to Boston College 5–2. The 1998 tournament was the program's first of two all-time Frozen Four appearances, the other coming in 2018. In 1999 the team advanced to the 1999 NCAA tournament. Despite a first round elimination with a 4–2 loss to Maine, this marked the first time in school history the team made the NCAA tournament in consecutive seasons.\nThe time period during the early 2000s was the most successful period in the program's history. Ohio State made the NCAA Post season tournament in 2003, 2004, and 2005. The 2003–2004 season also saw the Buckeyes win the school's second CCHA post season tournament with a 4–2 win over Big Ten and CCHA rival Michigan. After three seasons, the Buckeyes returned to the NCAA tournament in 2009, when they received an at-large bid to the 2009 NCAA tournament after a 5th-place finish in the CCHA regular season and falling to Alaska in the CCHA Quarterfinals. In the 2009 NCAA tournament the team lost 8–3 to Boston University in the first round. The program was also invited to play in the Frozen Tundra Hockey Classic against Wisconsin on February 11, 2006, which was the second-ever outdoor ice hockey game played between college teams.\nOn March 21, 2011 the Big Ten Conference announced plans to sponsor men's ice hockey starting in 2013–14 season. Ohio State along with CCHA rivals, Michigan and Michigan State would leave the CCHA to join Minnesota and Wisconsin from the WCHA and Penn State, who would elevate their men's and women's American Collegiate Hockey Association club programs to varsity status, to form a six-team Big Ten Hockey Conference.\nDuring the first half of the 2011–2012 season, the Buckeyes jumped out to a sizeable lead in the CCHA standings when the team recorded a 10–3–1 conference record. The second half of the season proved much harder for Ohio State when the team recorded an eleven-game winless streak through January and the first half of February. The team broke the streak with a 4–3 win over Western Michigan, the team's lone win in the second half of the season. The Buckeyes fell from a season high, second-place ranking in January 2012 to 21st place by the end of the regular season. In the first round of the 2012 CCHA tournament, Ohio State was swept by Notre Dame 2–0 and 4–2 in the best-of-three series.\nDespite an up and down 2013–14 season, Ohio State had a good showing in the inaugural Big Ten Hockey tournament. After defeating Michigan State in overtime in the first round, the Buckeyes upset #1 Minnesota 3–1. They ultimately fell 5–4 in overtime in the championship game to the Wisconsin Badgers. Despite missing out on the NCAA tournament, Ohio State would finish the 2013–14 season ranked #20.\nAfter back to back losing seasons in 2014–15 and 2015–16, Ohio State had their first 20 win season and NCAA tournament berth in 8 years. Led by forwards Nick Schilkey and Mason Jobst, the Buckeyes had the second ranked offense in college hockey and a historically great power play. Ohio State finished third in the Big Ten, their highest finish in the league's four-year history. Despite the successful season, Ohio State did not clinch a tournament berth until Penn State defeated Wisconsin in the 2017 Big Ten tournament, giving the Buckeyes the final at large berth and the 4 seed in the West Regional in Fargo, North Dakota. The Buckeyes faced off against the #2 overall seed, the Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs in the 1st round. A third period comeback sent the game to overtime with the score tied at two. The Bulldogs ended the Buckeyes season on a goal from Willie Raskob at 11:58 of the first overtime.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nCoaches.\nThe Buckeyes are currently coached by Steve Rohlik.

        "title": "Northern Michigan Wildcats men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Northern Michigan Wildcats men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents Northern Michigan University (NMU). The Wildcats are a member of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA). NMU has won one national title and has made three Frozen Four appearances. They play at the Berry Events Center in Marquette, Michigan.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nUnder the Direction of NMU's president, John X. Jamrich, the initial ice hockey program was originally initiated by Seniors Gregory Hyde and Christopher Nolan in 1974. The NMU men's ice hockey program began in 1976, competing as an independent NCAA Division I team and probationary member of Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) for the 1976–77 season. During that season NMU competed against CCHA teams but did not count for league standings. Northern Michigan became a full member of the CCHA the following season.\nIn the first two season as a full member of the CCHA Northern Michigan finished with back-to-back 19 win seasons before a historic season in program history in 1979–80. During the 1979–80 season the team won its first CCHA regular season championship and CCHA Playoff tournament championship. The Wildcats advanced to their first ever NCAA tournament appearance and won their first game 4–3 against Minnesota. NMU advanced to the National Championship game with a semifinal win over Cornell 5–4. Northern Michigan finished as the runner-up to North Dakota. In addition to the tournament being the first tournament and National Championship appearance for Northern Michigan, it was also the highest NCAA tournament finish for a CCHA team. NMU head coach Rick Comley became the first CCHA coach to receive the Spencer Penrose Award given to the NCAA Division I Men's Hockey Coach of the Year.\nThe success of the 1979–80 season continued for the 1980–81 season. The Wildcats again won the CCHA regular season and playoff championships and advanced to the NCAA tournament. The Wildcats won the quarterfinal game against Cornell 10–7 but fell to Wisconsin 5–1.\nWCHA years.\nOn January 5, 1984, Northern Michigan announced the program was leaving the CCHA after seven seasons two league and playoff championships and two NCAA tournament berths for the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). The following day it was announced that rival Michigan Tech was also leaving the CCHA for WCHA. The 1988–89 season marked the first time NMU qualified for the NCAA tournament as a member of the WCHA. Unlike previous NCAA appearances Northern Michigan fell in the first round to Providence 5–4.\nNorthern Michigan qualified for the 1991 NCAA tournament after winning the WCHA regular season championship. Northern Michigan won two games to none in the quarterfinal round against Alaska-Anchorage, 8–5 and 5–3. NMU advanced and beat Maine 5–3 in the semifinal round. The Wildcats matched up in the National Championship game in St. Paul, Minnesota on April 1, 1991, against Boston University and won 8–7 in three overtime periods. The 1990–91 season also set a program best record of 38–5–4 and a winning percentage of .851. It also marked the program's first and only NCAA Championship. The Wildcats returned to the National Tournament in 1992 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament as the 4th seed of the West Regional held in Detroit, Michigan. NMU picked up a first round win over Clarkson 8–4 before losing in the quarterfinal round 7–6 to Michigan. The 1992–93 season marked the third straight NCAA tournament appearance. NMU won a close game in the opening round of the 1993 tournament in the East Regional in Worcester, Massachusetts, against Harvard. The Wildcats won a close game 3–2 in two overtime periods but fell 4–1 in the second round to Boston University in a rematch of the 1991 National Championship.\nDuring the following seasons NMU remained competitive in the WCHA but by the mid-1990s the program fell into the bottom half of the standings. After six 20-plus win seasons from 1988 to 1989 season through the 1993–94 season, the Wildcats failed to reach 15 wins in their last three seasons in the WCHA. The 1995–96 season marked a program low record of 7–30–2. On August 19, 1996, the CCHA approved Northern Michigan's application to rejoin the league for the 1997–98 season after 13 years in the WCHA. During the years in the WCHA the Wildcats accumulated a record of 263–243–30.\nRecent history.\nThe return to the CCHA reinvigorated the program after several underachieving seasons and rebuilding years. In the 1996–97 season, the first back in the CCHA, the Wildcats finished with a record of 19–15–4. The season was the first winning record since the 1993–94 season. And in the following season NMU reached the NCAA National tournament for the seventh time in program history. Northern Michigan entered the tournament as the 5th seed in the West Regional. Northern Michigan's playoff run was ended early by Boston College in a low scoring game 1–2.\nOn June 13, 2002, it was announced that Walt Kyle would take over as head coach for the Wildcats to become the second coach in program history. Rick Comley left to take over the head coaching position at Michigan State after 26 seasons behind the bench of the Wildcats. Kyle won his first game as head coach of Northern Michigan on October 5, 2002, against Upper Michigan rival Michigan Tech, 4–1. Kyle's first CCHA victory came on October 18, 2002, 10–4 against Rick Comley and his Michigan State team. Kyle led the Wildcats to four straight 20+ win seasons from 2002 to 2006 and six of his first eight seasons behind the NMU bench.\nOne of the most successful seasons in recent history came in the 2009–10 season. Northern Michigan finished the regular season ranked fourth in the CCHA and ranked 16th in the nation. The Wildcats received a first round bye in the CCHA tournament and matched up against Alaska Fairbanks, coming off first round sweep of Western Michigan. Northern Michigan swept the Nanooks two games to none with 4–3 and 5–1 victories, advancing NMU to the semifinal round. Northern Michigan took on Ferris State looking to overcome the semifinal losses the previous two seasons. The Wildcats came out on top of their seventh appearance in the CCHA Semifinals in the last eight seasons with an overtime goal by Greger Hanson to give Northern Michigan the 5–4 OT win. The win was the first time Northern Michigan advanced to the CCHA Championship game since 1999, under Rick Comley. The Wildcats run in the CCHA playoffs ended in the Championship game, when Northern Michigan fell short in a close game to Michigan. The Wildcats' 2–1 loss to the Wolverines did not end their season as NMU received an at-large bid to the 2010 NCAA tournament, their first tournament appearance since 1999 and first under Walt Kyle. Northern Michigan's first NCAA tournament berth in 11 seasons took them to the West Regional at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minnesota, and first round match-up against St. Cloud State. The Wildcats battled hard in front of a pro-SCSU crowd. Northern Michigan found themselves down early 2–0 in the first period but picked up a late goal by sophomore forward Justin Florek. St. Cloud answered in the second period on the power play but Northern Michigan kept within one goal when senior forward Ray Kaunisto scored late in the period. St. Cloud was held scoreless in the third while Northern Michigan tied the game with an even strength goal under four minutes left in the third period by junior defenseman Erik Spady. The Two team battled hard through the first overtime before St. Cloud State's Tony Mosey scored 23 seconds into the second overtime. Senior goaltender Brian Stewart stopped 50 SCSU shots in the tough loss.\nIn the summer of 2011, the Big Ten Conference announced intentions to begin sponsoring men's ice hockey in 2013, followed by Miami (OH) announcing the formation of the National Collegiate Hockey Conference for 2013 with and five other schools breaking from the WCHA. The realignment continued on July 20, 2011, when Northern Michigan was approved for membership in the WCHA beginning with the 2013–14 season.\nIn June 2019, it was announced that Northern Michigan was one of seven WCHA men's members that would leave to form a new conference after the 2020–21 season. Those schools later announced that they would reestablish the CCHA effective in 2021–22.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nCoaches.\nThe Wildcats are currently coached by Grant Potulny, who assumed coaching duties after Walt Kyle's contract was not renewed in March 2017.\nStatistical leaders.\nThe team statistical leaders are given below.\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nAwards and honors.\nNCAA.\nSpencer Penrose Award\nNCAA Scoring Champion\nTournament Most Outstanding Player\nAHCA First Team All-Americans\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nWCHA.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nOutstanding Student-Athlete of the Year\nDefensive player of the year\nRookie of the Year\nCoach of the Year\nMost Valuable Player in tournament\nAll-conference teams.\nFirst Team All-WCHA\nSecond Team All-WCHA\nThird Team All-WCHA\nWCHA All-Rookie Team\nCCHA.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nCoach of the Year\nPerani Cup\nBest Offensive Defenseman\nBest Defensive Defenseman\nBest Goaltender\nAll-conference teams.\nFirst Team All-CCHA\nSecond Team All-CCHA\nCCHA All-Rookie Team\nNorthern Michigan Wildcats Hall of Fame.\nThe following is a list of people associated with the Northern Michigan men's ice hockey program who were elected into the Northern Michigan Wildcats Hall of Fame (induction date in parentheses).\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of Northern Michigan alumni who have played on an Olympic team.\nWildcats in the NHL.\nSource:\nNotable players.\nDual US/French citizen Eric LeMarque went on to play for Team France at the \n1994 Winter Olympics, later losing his feet to frostbite in a mishap chronicled in autobiography and in the 2017 film \"\".\nArena.\nThe Wildcats play at the 3,902-seat Berry Events Center on the NMU campus in Marquette, Michigan.

        "text": "The Omaha Mavericks men's ice hockey team, also called the Nebraska Omaha Mavericks and UNO Mavericks, is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents the University of Nebraska Omaha. The Mavericks are a member of the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC). They play home games at Baxter Arena, an on-campus facility that opened in 2015. The Mavericks hockey program was started in 1997; the team has qualified for the NCAA tournament on four occasions, in 2006, 2011, 2015, and 2021. During the 2015 tournament, the team made their first appearance in the tournament semifinals, branded by the NCAA as the Frozen Four. The Mavericks competed in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) between 1999 and 2010 before joining the WCHA for the 2010–11 season.\nThe Mavericks joined the National Collegiate Hockey Conference starting in the 2013–14 season along with fellow charter members Colorado College, the University of Denver, Miami University, the University of Minnesota Duluth, and the University of North Dakota, plus invited founding members St. Cloud State University and Western Michigan University.\nHistory.\nEarly history (1995–1999).\nIn June 1995, the University of Nebraska Omaha began talks with local hockey supporters on the feasibility of a varsity men's ice hockey program. Shortly thereafter, the school re-hired long-time Athletic Director Don Leahy. Leahy returned to the school after a ten-year absence to start the hockey program. On May 1, 1996, the university announced that they would add a varsity men's ice hockey team for the 1997–98 season. Although the school was a Division II team in all other sports, UNO joined Division I for ice hockey. Season tickets went on sale shortly thereafter. By May 16 of that year, the university capped season ticket sales at 6,389 just two weeks after the university announced the creation of the team. The Omaha City Council, encouraged by the support for the Mavericks, approved an ice sheet for the Omaha Civic Auditorium shortly thereafter.\nOn June 26, 1996, Leahy hired Mike Kemp to be the first Maverick hockey coach. Kemp had spent the previous 14 years as an assistant and head recruiter for the University of Wisconsin, helping them to nine NCAA tournament appearances and a national championship in 1990. It was a return to Omaha for Kemp, who was the head coach for UNO's club hockey team in its brief existence in 1975 and 1976. Kemp hired former NHL first round draft choice David Quinn as his top assistant and head recruiter, and set about recruiting a team for the 1997 season. They establish the school's first Division I men's ice hockey program, which began playing during the 1997–98 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season.\nUNO played its first season as an Independent in 1997-98. On October 17, 1997, a sellout crowd at the Civic Auditorium saw the team for the first time in a 3–2 exhibition loss to the University of Manitoba. Despite a midseason ten-game losing streak, the Mavericks finished with an encouraging 12–18–3 record. The Mavericks earned a surprising sweep over traditional powerhouse Denver and a 4–3 road victory over Maine, a night after losing 11–0. The team sold out all 19 of their home games to finish second in the NCAA in attendance. Following UNO's first season, the Mavericks made the somewhat surprising decision to apply for membership to the Central Collegiate Hockey Association. Many expected the school to seek admission to the Western Collegiate Hockey Association, as the conference was a better geographic fit and included UNO's Division II North Central Conference rivals Minnesota State, North Dakota, and St. Cloud State. However, the school was intrigued by matchups against big-name foes like Michigan, Ohio State, and Notre Dame, and was accepted into the CCHA on June 24, 1998. UNO would become a full member of the conference starting with the 1999–2000 season. The Mavericks struggled in their second season as an independent, starting the season 2–18–0 en route to an 11–24–0 record. UNO won only one of seven games against future CCHA opponents, a 6–1 victory over Bowling Green. Despite the poor record, the school once again sold out all of its home games, finishing third in the NCAA in home attendance.\nCCHA years (1999–2009).\nUNO surprised many in the 1999–2000 season, its first in the CCHA. The team finished with a 10–12–6 record in the conference, good for seventh in the conference and a berth in the CCHA tournament. The Mavericks took the best-of-three first-round series at fourth-seeded Northern Michigan. In other first-round action, eighth-seeded Bowling Green upset Lake Superior State; the Falcons' victory meant that the Civic Auditorium would host a one-game playoff for the right to go to the CCHA Final Four. In front of a sellout raucous home crowd, the Mavericks won 3–1 in a game that became known in Maverick lore as simply \"Tuesday Night\". The Mavericks kept the Cinderella run alive at the Final Four, as they stunned top-seeded Michigan 7–4 in front of a pro-Michigan crowd at Joe Louis Arena. UNO entered the tournament final against Michigan State one game away from qualifying for the NCAA Tournament in their first year as a CCHA member. After the teams entered the first intermission scoreless, the Spartans scored three goals over a 5:29 span in the second period to break the game open en route to a 6–0 victory.\nOn the heels of their surprising run at the 2000 CCHA Tournament, the Mavericks began the season ranked number 13 in the USCHO.com Poll and number 14 in the \"USA Today\" poll, the first time the Mavericks had been nationally ranked in their short history. The Mavericks hosted the Maverick Stampede for the first time that year, a four-team season opening tournament that has been held in each year since 2000. The UNO topped Niagara in the tournament before falling to 4th-ranked Boston College in the final. Perhaps as a result of heightened expectations, the Mavericks struggled early in the season, falling to a season worst 6–8–0 at the end of November. The team eventually put things together, finishing with the school's first winning record at 24–15–3. After falling out of both polls by midseason, the Mavericks were ranked #13 in the final USCHO.com and USA Today polls, although they again came up just short of the then-12 team NCAA Tournament. The 24 victories are still a Maverick record for a single season. Sophomore David Brisson tallied 22 goals and 47 points, shattering the team record in both categories that he had set a year earlier (17, 32). Following the season, future NHLer Greg Zanon became the first Mav to be named an All-American, when the ACHA named him to their All-America Second Team.\nThe 2001–02 season was a mixture of success and disappointment for UNO. For the second consecutive year, UNO posted more than 20 wins, finishing 21–16–4. Zanon again was named second-team All-America; he was joined on the team by Jeff Hoggan, who topped Brisson's school record with 24 goals. However, the team again failed to qualify for the NCAA Tournament, a disappointment given that the team had been ranked as high as #5 in both major polls early in the season and returned its top four points scorers and future NHL goaltender Dan Ellis from the previous season's 24-win team.\nThe Mavericks were unable to build on the consecutive winning seasons in the following years. In 2002–03, the team was within striking distance of a third consecutive winning season before limping to a 13–22–5 record after going winless in their last eight games. The 2002–03 would be the last in which UNO was a full-time tenant of the Civic Auditorium after selling out all 131 games that they played in the arena. Following the season, they would move to the newly constructed 14,700-seat Qwest Center Omaha. The following season, 2003–04, was the Mavericks' worst to date, as a young UNO team finished last in the conference with an 8–26–5 record. Despite this, the Mavericks continued to draw fans; although the team was unable to sell out the new arena, they finished fourth in the NCAA in attendance. The Mavericks rebounded the following season to finish 19–16–4. The team was led by a promising set of young players. Sophomore Scott Parse tallied a team-high 49 points, and freshman Bill Thomas added 45 more. Following the season, Thomas was named CCHA Freshman of the Year and Kemp was named CCHA Coach of the Year, the first two major awards in the program's history.\nThe 2005–06 season was UNO's most successful to date. The team used a ten-game unbeaten streak in January and February to finish 20–12–6 to earn their first-ever berth in the NCAA Tournament. Parse set team records with 41 assists and 61 points and was UNO's first Hobey Baker Award finalist. Following the season, Parse became the first Maverick selected as a first-team All-American and Conference Player of the Year. Thomas scored a team-record 27 goals, combining with Parse to form the most potent first line in UNO history. The two helped the Mavericks to 141 goals, the most in the CCHA. The team struggled defensively after the previous year's goaltender Chris Holt signed with the New York Rangers in the offseason. Walk-on freshman Jerad Kaufmann – the third-string goalie at the beginning of the season – eventually laid claim to the job. UNO's inexperience eventually got the best of the team, as they were dominated by Boston University in a 9–2 loss in the first round of the NCAA tournament. The Terriers broke open a 1–1 game with a six-goal second period to end UNO's first NCAA Tournament appearance. Once again, the Mavericks could not build on their successes in the following seasons, as they finished in the middle of the pack each year in the conference. The squad finished two games over .500 in 2006–07, followed by finishing two games under .500 for the next two seasons. In 2008–09, the team started out 12–4–3 – the best start in school history – before collapsing down the stretch and winning only three of their last 21 games.\nWCHA years (2010–2013).\nThe disappointing 2008–09 season led many to speculate about the future of the program. On April 29, 2009, UNO hired former University of Nebraska linebacker Trev Alberts as athletic director. Alberts immediately began overhauling the hockey program. Kemp had one year remaining on his contract as coach and had little chance for an extension following the team's failure to build on the success of the 2006 NCAA Tournament team. Not willing to let go of the only coach the program had ever had, Alberts promoted Kemp to Associate Athletic Director and placed him in charge of the hockey program. Shortly thereafter, Alberts made a huge splash by hiring former North Dakota coaching great Dean Blais as head coach. With Blais on board, observers quickly began speculating that UNO would join the WCHA. With the men's side of College Hockey America breaking up following the 2009–10 season, Bemidji State submitted an application to be the WCHA's 11th member. The WCHA made it clear that they would only consider expansion in even numbers; rumors circulated that the conference coveted UNO. Within ten days of Blais's hiring, speculation was put to rest as the WCHA announced on June 23 that UNO (along with Bemidji State) would join the league for the 2010–11 season. The Mavericks once again finished in the middle of the conference in their final season in the CCHA, although they did finish with 20 wins for only the third time in school history, with a 20–16–6 record. The team struggled early in the season before finishing strong in Blais's first season with the team, finishing the regular season 10–3–1 over their last fourteen games before being stopped by Ferris State in the CCHA playoffs.\nUNO joined the WCHA as a full-time member starting with the 2010–11 season. The Mavericks started the season on a positive note, as they stunned Minnesota with a two-game sweep at Mariucci Arena in their first ever conference battle. UNO continued its hot start through the beginning of November by winning seven of their first eight games. The team was ranked #6 and #7 in the two major polls, their highest ranking since 2001. The Mavericks ended the regular season 3rd in the WCHA with a conference record of 17-9-2 and advanced to their first ever WCHA Tournament before being upset with a two-game sweep in the first round by 10th seeded Bemidji State. Despite the loss the Mavericks qualified for the 2011 NCAA Tournament ranked 14th in the National Pairwise rankings. UNO received a 3rd seed in the West Regional, located in St. Louis, Missouri and played 2nd seeded Michigan in the first round. The first period ended with UNO up 2-0 but the Wolverines rallied in the second period and both teams went scoreless in the third, sending the game to overtime. The Mavericks' season came to an end 2:35 into overtime after a shot off a faceoff by and rebound goal by Wolverine sophomore, Kevin Lynch, followed by a ten-minute review to confirm the goal.\nSeason-by-season results.\nSource:\nArenas.\nUNO played at the Omaha Civic Auditorium in its first six years of existence (1997–2003). The school capped season ticket sales at just below 6,400 tickets within two weeks after the program's inception was announced in May 1996. The Mavericks eventually sold out the 8,314-seat arena 131 consecutive times between October 1997 and March 2003. Following the 2002–03 season, the team moved to what was then known as Qwest Center Omaha; in many of the Mavericks' 13 seasons at that arena, the Mavericks played one series in February at the Civic Auditorium when the Qwest Center hosted the Nebraska State High School Wrestling tournament.\nBeginning in the 2003–04 season, the Mavericks played at the newly constructed 14,700-seat Qwest Center Omaha, now known as CenturyLink Center Omaha. The sleek, new modern arena immediately received rave reviews; one reporter dubbed the arena \"the Omaha Civic Auditorium on steroids.\" Still, many fans were turned off by the new arena, complaining that the giant structure was not as intimate as the Civic Auditorium. Although UNO's hockey administration initially expected attendance to average about 11,000 fans, an average of only 8,184 fans filled the arena in the poor 2003–04 season. This number was still the fourth highest figure in the NCAA, but was actually down slightly from the average at the much smaller Civic Auditorium. Still, the modern arena became an important recruiting tool for the Mavericks coaching staff. Some of the team's best recruiting classes came in the years immediately following the move to the new arena, eventually helping the team to their first NCAA tournament appearance in 2006. In the years following the first season at the CenturyLink Center, attendance averaged between 5,500 and 6,900 per game, finishing in the top eleven in the NCAA each year, but never meeting initial attendance expectations.\nThe school had a lease at the CenturyLink Center through the 2012–13 season. By that time, athletic director Trev Alberts had been drumming up support for a new arena because of the unfavorable lease at the CenturyLink Center; the school lost $150,000 as part of the deal in 2008–09 after turning a $1 million profit in its last year at the Civic Auditorium in 2002–03. Rumors circulated that UNO planned to build an on-campus arena that seats between 7,000 and 8,000 fans. At the WCHA preseason media day in October 2010, coach Dean Blais told media members that the school hoped to break ground on an on-campus arena at some point in 2011.\nThe arena plans did not materialize until 2013, when the University of Nebraska system approved the construction of a venue that was known during its planning and initial construction stages as UNO Community Arena. The new facility, which holds slightly under 7,900 and also includes a dedicated practice facility, opened in October 2015 as Baxter Arena.\nCoaches.\nThe Mavericks were coached by Mike Kemp between the program's inception in 1997 and 2009. Prior to the 1997 season, Kemp served as an assistant coach for 14 years at Wisconsin. In his only previous head coaching stint, Kemp was the coach of the UNO club hockey team during its brief existence in 1975 and 1976. Kemp is credited with helping build the nascent program over his tenure, and eventually led the team to its only NCAA Tournament appearance to date in 2006. After the 2004–05 season, he was named CCHA Coach of the Year. He was named Associate Athletic Director for UNO following the 2009 season.\nDean Blais was hired in June 2009 to replace Mike Kemp on the UNO bench. Blais is best known as the former head coach at North Dakota from 1994 through 2004, where he won two national titles (1997 and 2000). Blais also served as assistant coach of the Columbus Blue Jackets from 2004 to 2007, and later as head coach and GM of the Fargo Force (USHL) from 2007 to 2009. During his first season at UNO, Blais also served as head coach of the gold medal winning USA team at the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. During his second season at UNO, Blais was named WCHA Coach of the Year. Blais retired at the end of the 2016-17 season.\nThe Mavericks are currently coached by former Omaha player Mike Gabinet, who was named head coach April 5, 2017.\nStatistical leaders.\nSource:\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nAwards and honors.\nNCAA.\nAll-Americans.\nAHCA First Team All-Americans\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nCCHA.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nBest Offensive Defenseman\nCoach of the Year\nScholar-Athlete of the Year\nIlitch Humanitarian Award\nAll-Conference Teams.\nFirst Team All-CCHA\nSecond Team All-CCHA\nCCHA All-Rookie Team\nWCHA.\nIndividual awards.\nCoach of the Year\nAll-Conference Teams.\nFirst Team All-WCHA\nThird Team All-WCHA\nWCHA All-Rookie Team\nNCHC.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nForward of the Year\nScholar-Athlete of the Year\nAll-Conference Teams.\nFirst Team All-NCHC\nSecond Team All-NCHC\nNCHC All-Rookie Team\nOmaha Mavericks Hall of Fame.\nThe following is a list of people associated with the Omaha Mavericks men's ice hockey program who were elected into the Nebraska Omaha Athletic Hall of Fame (induction date in parentheses).\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of Omaha alumni were a part of an Olympic team.\nMavericks in the NHL.\nSource:\nSchool records.\nThe following are the UNO school records.

        "text": "The East Carolina Pirates men's basketball team represents East Carolina University in NCAA Division I college basketball and competes in the American Athletic Conference. The Pirates are coached by Mike Schwartz.\nHistory.\nBasketball became the first intercollegiate sport at East Carolina, beginning with the 1931–1932 season. The Pirates joined the NAIA North State Conference in 1947, winning the conference title in 1953–54 and appeared in the NAIA National Tournament two years in 1953 and '54, winning two district titles before losing in the first round of the national finals. Ten years later, ECU made the jump to Division I as a member of the Southern Conference and became a full-fledged member during the 1965–66 season. ECU captured the SoCon tournament title in 1972 and reached the NCAA tournament for the first time. Three years later, ECU returned to the postseason when it received an invitation to inaugural Collegiate Commissioners Tournament, losing to Arizona in the first round. ECU withdrew from the Southern Conference two years later, opting to remain a Division I-A football institution and an independent in all other sports.\nECU joined the East Coast Athletic Conference and competed in the South Division in 1981–82. The seven members of the division formed the Colonial Athletic Association in 1985. Theodore \"Blue\" Edwards was named the conference's Player-of-the-Year for 1988–89 and as selected by the Utah Jazz with the 21st overall pick of the 1989 NBA draft. Two years later, ECU hired Eddie Payne as its head coach and in his second year he led the Pirates to a memorable three-day run through the 1993 CAA Championship tournament and the program's first NCAA appearance in 21 years. ECU lost to eventual national champion North Carolina in the first round. Payne coached the Pirates for four seasons before giving way to his top assistant Joe Dooley, who also led the program for four seasons (1995–99) and compiled the highest winning percentage in the school's Division I history.\nAfter 15 years as a member of the CAA, ECU joined Conference USA in 2001–02 and its first season earned its first-ever victory over an AP Top-10 team, defeating No. 9 Marquette. The Pirates spent 13 seasons in C-USA before becoming a member of the newly formed American Athletic Conference in 2014–15. As a member of Conference USA, ECU made three consecutive appearances in the CIT postseason tournament, claiming the tournament championship in 2013 as Akeem Richmond's buzzer-beater gave the Pirates a championship game win over Weber State.\nEast Carolina has had four players to reach the NBA level. In addition to Edwards, Oliver Mack who was selected by the Los Angeles Lakers as the third pick in the second round of the 1979 NBA draft, George Maynor, who was selected by the Chicago Bulls as the sixth pick in the fourth round of the 1979 NBA Draft, and Charles Alford, who was selected by the Los Angeles Lakers as the ninth pick in the 10th round of the 1968 NBA draft.\nWilliams Arena at Minges Coliseum.\nThe Pirates play their home games at the 8,000-seat Williams Arena at Minges Coliseum. The arena is connected to the second level of the Murphy Center, the Pirates' athletic training facility, by an indoor walkway.\nConstructed at a cost of $2 million, Minges Coliseum was dedicated on Jan. 27, 1968, in the name of the Minges family of Greenville, N.C. As owners of Pepsi-Cola bottling operations in Greenville, Kinston and New Bern, the Minges family has provided leadership and support of East Carolina University Athletics over the years, going back to the days when Dr. Ray Minges served as President of the Century Club (forerunner of the Pirate Club), from 1965–68. After 27 years of basketball, Minges Coliseum underwent a facelift prior to the 1994–95 season. \nWilliams Arena is named in honor and recognition of Walter and Marie Williams for their support of East Carolina Athletics over the years. As alumni of East Carolina College, Walter and Marie have endowed two Men's Basketball Position scholarships, the Spirit of the East Post-Eligibility Scholarship, and an unrestricted student-athlete scholarship on behalf of the University's athletics program. Further, through Trade Oil Company, the Williams family gave the first $1 million gift ever given to the Educational Foundation in support of ECU Athletics, through the Shared Visions Campaign. In addition to his financial support, Walter Williams has given his time unselfishly in support of the Pirate Club. During 1997–98, Walter served as Executive President of the Educational Foundation.\nSmith-Williams Center.\nThe Smith-Williams Center, which is structurally connected to Minges Coliseum, is the headquarters for and is devoted exclusively to the men's and women's basketball programs, providing them with a state-of-the-art venue in which to practice, train and condition. The , multi-level facility, which opened in 2013, features mirror-image practice courts, locker rooms, coaches' offices, meeting rooms, and training rooms for each program, and houses the Athletics Hall of Fame, which features an interactive display of the history of intercollegiate athletics at ECU.\nNamed in honor of principal donors Harry and Tammy Smith and Walter and Marie Williams, the center has a total project cost of $17 million that was funded entirely through private gifts. The Smith's commitment of $1 million toward the Step Up To The Highest Level Campaign in December 2011, coupled with leadership gifts from the Williams family and contributions of numerous other donors enabled the construction of the facility. Each court is named for donors who contributed significantly to the Step Up To The Highest Level campaign. The floor inside the women's practice gym is called Barnhill Court, in recognition of the financial support of Bob Barnhill of Tarboro. The men's gym floor is named Rogers-Whitaker court, in appreciation of the monetary gifts of Mike and Janet Rogers of Cary, N.C., and Don and Donna Whitaker of Virginia Beach, Va. Whitaker was a two-year ECU basketball letterman for coaches Dave Patton and Larry Gillman.\nDivision I post season results.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe Pirates have appeared in two NCAA tournaments. Their combined record is 0–2.\nCIT.\nThe Pirates have appeared in three CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournaments (CIT). Their combined record is 5–2 and they were CIT champions in 2013.\nNCIT.\nThe Pirates appeared in one of the only two ever Collegiate Commissioners Association Tournaments. Their record was 0–1."

        "text": "Henry Percy Phillips OBE (1869 – 26 February 1947) was a Welsh rugby union international fly-half who played club rugby for Newport. He won six caps for Wales and played in all three games of the 1893 Home Nations Championship which saw Wales lift the Triple Crown for the first time in the country's history.\nOutside rugby, Phillips was a Vice Consul to Belgium, and one season he managed 26 appearances for Newport despite working much of that time in Switzerland.\nRugby career.\nNicknamed 'Sparrow', due to his very light frame, Phillips was a fly-half noted for his excellent attacking play, but was weak defensively and was a poor kicker. Phillips is also recognised as one of the first specialised rugby players in Welsh rugby. Under the captaincy of Arthur 'Monkey' Gould, Newport utilised team-mate Fred Parfitt's expert passing to secure the scrum-half berth which linked up with Phillips as a specialised runner. Phillips was also used as a running partner with Gould, for Newport and later Wales, breaking shoulder to shoulder with his captain, and using fast inter-passing to confuse defenders.\nPhillips was first chosen to represent Wales during the opening game of the 1892 Home Nations Championship, partnered with Penarth's George Rowles. The game was played away at Blackheath against England, and Rowles and Phillips had been brought in as replacements for the Swansea half-backs brothers Evan and David James. Wales lost 17–0 and the next match saw the reintroduction of the James brothers. The James brothers played out the rest of the Championship for Wales, but then both switched codes to play for professional league team Broughton Rangers. This made the Swansea pair ineligible to play for the Wales team, and created an opening at both halfback positions for the next season.\nPhillips was reselected to play for Wales in 1893, this time partnered with his Newport team-mate Parfitt. The pair played for Wales throughout the 1893 Championship, which saw Welsh victories in all three games, giving Wales the Triple Crown for the very first time. Phillips played his part throughout the tournament, and was instrumental in setting up Gould's second try in the narrow victory over England in the tournament opener at the Cardiff Arms Park.\nPhillips played just two more international games, both as part of the 1894 Home Nations Championship. Again linking up with Parfitt, Wales lost the first game of the competition, defeated heavily by England. Phillips was selected for the very next game against Scotland, which Wales won 7–0, all points coming from Cardiff's Dai Fitzgerald. Phillips was replaced by Ralph Sweet-Escott for the final game, against Ireland, his international career over.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "text": "Rugby union in Hungary is a minor but growing sport.\nThe Hungarian Rugby Union (Hungarian: \"Magyar Rögbi Szövetség\") was founded in 1990, and affiliated to the IRB in 1991.\nHistory.\nAs early as 1875 a group of British Embassy employees played rugby on the \"Szabadság tér\" (Freedom Square) in Budapest.\nAt the 1935 World University Games held in Budapest, rugby was also included in the program (won 12-10 by France against Germany). Reasons given for the hosts not participating were lack of time for preparation and a serious injury suffered by a player.\nItalians have played a major part in the establishment of Hungarian rugby, namely the late Carlos Passalacqua and his friends from the Italian Embassy in Budapest. The game was originally introduced by a group of Italian diplomats in the 1960s and 70s. who founded a number of clubs. However, when they left, the game withered away in all but Budapest, where a small group of enthusiasts kept it going. Like neighbouring Austria and the Czech Republic, rugby has tended to be strongest in the national capital Budapest (which os by far the largest settlement in the country, containing 20% of the population) - however, in 1981, it would spread into the town of Kecskemét.\nThe former All Black scrum half Chris Laidlaw, writing at the end of the 1970s, saw rugby as a positive force in east-west relations at the time:\nChris Laidlaw writing of the open secret of shamateurism in Soviet sport said:\nHungary had its first international in 1990, shortly after the foundation of the national union. This was against East Germany, which they lost with a respectable scoreline of 3-7.\nIn the early 1990s, former Italian cap, Dr Giancarlo Tiziani was a major driving force in Austrian rugby. Before his death in 1994, he tried hard to establish a Central European equivalent of the Five Nations between Austria, Hungary, Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia.\nThere are over two thousand registered players in the country.\nOn 6 October 2012 a new record was set for most spectators to watch a rugby match in the country with over 3000 people watching Hungary win against Bulgaria 28-23 in a Rugby World Cup 2015 qualifier.\nNotable players.\nHungarian actor András Stohl played scrum-half for the now-defunct ELTE-BEAC in the 1980s. He was also involved with the MRgSz in some capacity in the first decade of the 2000s."

        "text": "Rugby union in the Netherlands is a popular sport. The sport is governed by the Rugby Nederland, which organizes the Netherlands national rugby union team.\nGoverning body.\nThe Rugby Nederland was founded on 7 September 1920 but ceased to exist in 1923 due to a lack of clubs. They reorganized on 1 October 1932, as Dutch Rugby Union (Dutch: \"Nederlandse Rugby Bond\"), two years after the Netherlands national rugby union team played their first match against Belgium. The union is affiliated to the IRB in 1988 and has 15,000 registered players (in 2017).\nHistory.\nThe first rugby club was HFC, established on 15 September 1879 by the 14-year-old Pim Mulier, who first encountered the sport in 1870. However, HFC switched to association football in 1883. The \"Delftsche Studenten Rugby - Club (DSR-C)\" was the first official rugby club on 24 September 1918.\nDutch rugby started setting down roots in the pre-World War II period. The subsequent German occupation and World War II disrupted its growth, and it took years for the Dutch game to return to its pre-war state. Then in the post-war years, the massive growth and stifling influence of Dutch association football on other sports also hindered further development.\nThe first Dutch international was in 1932, against Belgium.\nNonetheless, the Netherlands' proximity to the European rugby heartland of the British Isles and France, has ensured a fairly healthy stream of touring sides\nfrom these areas. Given the low profile of the game in the Netherlands, Dutch rugby still manages to support over a hundred clubs, and has 7–8,000 players, which is a larger number than some Rugby World Cup entrants.\nWomen's rugby in the Netherlands started at Rugbyclub Wageningen in 1975. At their first 5-year anniversary the Wageningen rugby men organized a rugby match for the girlfriends against the girlfriends of the befriended Eindhoven Students rugby team The Elephants. The Wageningen women won this game with 4-0 and the seed for Dutch women rugby was planted. It took until 1981 when the first official women rugby competition round was played.\nIn the 1978–79 season, the Dutch leagues were affected by a severe winter, which prevented teams from playing on grass rugby pitches. Matches were transferred onto beaches to avoid snow and ice.\nIn 1988, Marcel Bierman, a fly half, broke his neck in the Hong Kong Sevens, and this gave the sport a bad image in the Netherlands at the time.\nDutch rugby received a boost in 1996 when they beat a full-strength team from Moseley RFC."

This was the last season before the introduction of the Home Nations Championship.\nThe only recognised competition held between the countries was the annual Calcutta Cup match, contested between England and Scotland. It was the fourth challenge for the trophy, and the first time Scotland won it, beating England by two tries to nil.\nFormat.\nThe matches for this season were decided on goals scored. A goal was awarded for a successful conversion after a try, for a dropped goal or for a goal from mark. If a game was drawn, any unconverted tries were tallied to give a winner. If there was still no clear winner, the match was declared a draw.\nResults.\nIreland vs. Wales.\nThis match was the first ever meeting between the two nations rugby union teams; and resulted in the first ever Welsh victory over international opposition. Ten of the Irish teams were new caps, which reflected the makeshift nature of the Irish team after ten of the original squad withdrew before the match. Kennedy of Ireland withdrew with an injury after half an hour of play and Atkinson took a serious injury to his nose. The match itself was frequently disrupted after disputes broke out from both sides, with Wales finishing victorious.\nThe sports correspondent from \"The Irish Times\" wrote a damning article in his match coverage, referring to the \"dormant apathy\" of the Irish team.\nEngland vs. Scotland.\nAt the fourth attempt, Scotland won the Calcutta Cup for the first time.\nWales vs. North of England.\nAlthough not a full international, the match between Wales and the North of England was important for the establishment of the Home Nations Championship the following season. In 1881, Wales had suffered such a crushing defeat at the hands of the English that it their readiness for full international participation was brought into question. In 1882 it was therefore decided to put a North of England team against them. The winning margin attained by the North was by just a goal to a try. This good form shown by the Welsh added to their victory over Ireland, gained for them a place in the International fixtures of the future."

It was released on Amiga, Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and IBM PC compatibles.\nSummary.\nIt was one of the first video games to carry the Major League Baseball license, allowing the game to feature MLB teams. It also carried the Major League Baseball Players Association license, allowing the game to use real players.\nA general manager disk available separately allowed users to make trades with other teams or create their own players. A stat compiler disk allowed players to save the results of every played game and compile statistics for each player, allowing users to play an entire season. The game was unique for its time for its concentration on management. Things like batter stance and fielder placement were all possible for the first time in a licensed baseball game.\nThe original game came with a variety of all-time great teams, including the 1927 New York Yankees, 1945 Chicago Cubs, 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers, 1961 New York Yankees, 1963 Los Angeles Dodgers, 1967 St. Louis Cardinals, 1968 Detroit Tigers, 1969 New York Mets, 1970 Baltimore Orioles, 1973 Oakland Athletics, 1975 Cincinnati Reds, 1975 Boston Red Sox, 1979 Pittsburgh Pirates, 1980 Philadelphia Phillies, 1980 Kansas City Royals and the 1982 Milwaukee Brewers. Additionally, the game included an AL All-Time Greats team as well as an NL All-Time Greats Team. Further, the game also included the 1984 AL and NL All-Star Game rosters. The roster size for all teams was 15 hitters and ten pitchers.\nReception.\n\"Computer Gaming World\" in 1985 praised \"MicroLeague Baseball\"s graphics but noted that it did not keep individual statistics. \"Ahoy!\" called it \"a rock-solid stat game dressed up in visuals which would do any action baseball game proud\", concluding that \"\"MicroLeague Baseball\" is highly recommended for baseball-loving computerists\"."

        "text": "These are the individual stages of the 2009 Tour de France, with Stage 1 on July 4 and Stage 11 on July 15.\nStages.\nStage 1.\n4 July 2009 — Monaco, 15.5 km (ITT)\nThe 2009 Tour began, as have many in the past, with an individual time trial, but instead of a very brief prologue, this 15 kilometer ride saw the race's overall favorites show themselves on day one. The favourite for the stage, Fabian Cancellara, won with Alberto Contador coming in second. Time-trial specialist Bradley Wiggins came third.\nStage 2.\n5 July 2009 — Monaco to Brignoles, 182 km\nThis stage was largely flat, but had one third category, and three fourth category, climbs in its first 129 km, and most of the last 15 km was downhill. A four-man breakaway (Stéphane Augé, Stef Clement, Cyril Dessel and Jussi Veikkanen) held a maximum advantage of some 5 minutes, but they were caught with 10 km remaining, initially by Mikhail Ignatiev, and shortly after by the rest of the peloton. Ignatiev was caught with 5 km left, and some of the cyclists shaping to contest the sprint were disrupted by a crash and a missed turn in the last kilometre, allowing Mark Cavendish a clear win.\nStage 3.\n6 July 2009 — Marseille to La Grande-Motte, 196 km\nStage 3 was another flat stage, with a finish on the waterfront at La Grande-Motte. Like in stage 2, a four-man breakaway formed, this time consisting of Maxime Bouet, Koen de Kort, Samuel Dumoulin and Rubén Pérez. They held a maximum advantage of about 13 minutes and were caught with a little less than 30 kilometres to go by a first group who had separated themselves from the rest of the peloton as a result of accelerating in the presence of strong winds near the coastline. The group contained 28 riders, including leader Fabian Cancellara, 7-time winner Lance Armstrong and the whole Team Columbia–HTC. After a sprint, Mark Cavendish finished first. Several of the favorites and riders classified in the top 10, such as Alberto Contador, Cadel Evans, Carlos Sastre, the Schleck brothers, Levi Leipheimer and Bradley Wiggins, were not present in this group and were 41 seconds behind at the finish.\nStage 4.\n7 July 2009 — Montpellier, 38 km (TTT)\n This was the first team time trial in the Tour since 2005. Riders finishing with the first five members of their team all received the same time: riders who became isolated from their team recorded an individual time. The time trial was won by , beating , who rode about half the race with only 5 riders left, by 18 seconds. Fabian Cancellara and took 40 seconds longer than Astana, Cancellara thus having the same overall time as Lance Armstrong but retaining the yellow jersey by virtue of the fractions of a second recorded in the opening time trial.\nAfter the race, some riders complained that the course was too dangerous and that this course was unworthy of a major race like this. During the race several riders had indeed crashed, amongst them Denis Menchov, Alessandro Ballan, Bingen Fernández, Jurgen Van den Broeck, 4 riders of and also Piet Rooijakkers. Rooijakkers fractured his arm and was rushed off to a hospital, ending his tour.\nStage 5.\n8 July 2009 — Le Cap d'Agde to Perpignan, 197 km\nThe Tour visited Cap d'Agde for only the second time ever, as the early Tour flat stages continued. Perpignan, on the other hand, is a traditional city for the Tour to visit, thought to symbolically indicate the Tour's entrance to (or exit from, in \"counter-clockwise\" years) the Pyrenees. A six rider breakaway, consisting of Anthony Geslin, Yauheni Hutarovich, Mikhail Ignatiev, Marcin Sapa, Albert Timmer and Thomas Voeckler, formed within the first kilometre, and achieved a maximum lead of more than nine and a half minutes. Attacks by Ignatiev in the last 10 km had reduced the escape group to four, until with 5 km Voeckler made what proved to be the decisive break. Ignatiev finished second just in front of Cavendish and the rest of the pack.\nDuring the race, the peloton had split into several groups as a result of the wind, as had happened two days before. Among the absentees in the first group of the peloton were Denis Menchov and Tom Boonen, but they and their group managed to return to the main group after several kilometres of chasing. Robert Gesink, who had crashed just before the windy passage along the coastline started, eventually had to let the peloton go and finished more than nine minutes behind with what in the end proved to be a broken wrist.\nStage 6.\n9 July 2009 — Girona (Spain) to Barcelona (Spain), 175 km\nThis last flat stage before the 2009 Tour entered the Pyrenees took place entirely within Spain, on a course that is frequently used in the Tour of Catalonia. The main break of the day was instigated by David Millar after 46 km, and he was joined by Stéphane Augé, who took the King of the Mountains leadership, and Sylvain Chavanel, and eventually by Amets Txurruka. Millar, 10th at the beginning of the stage, was virtual leader of the tour for much of the day, as the lead extended to 3'45\", and he attacked and left behind his fellow escapees with 29 km remaining. The uphill approach to the finish on Montjuïc did not suit some of the sprinters, but there was a group of about 60 at the head of the field when Millar was caught near the 1 km red flag, and with some GC contenders and climbers contesting the finish, Thor Hushovd emerged as stage winner.\nThe day was marked by numerous rain showers, and a number of falls, with Michael Rogers the main overall contender to lose considerable time.\nStage 7.\n10 July 2009 — Barcelona (Spain) to Andorra-Arcalis (Andorra)- 224 km\nThis second stage in a row that did not visit French soil was both the longest stage, and the highest finish of this year's tour. The first key break of the day comprised three riders, and escaped after 8 km of cycling, but it was joined by a six-man chase group shortly after the first of the day's minor climbs, but this was the day on which the race reached the high mountains. The escapees stretched their advantage to more than 14 minutes before reaching the major climbs, but as they included Rinaldo Nocentini, who was 32nd in the general classification and only 3'13\" behind the yellow jersey, the peloton, driven by the Astana squad, made a chase. Although the lead was greatly reduced, all but one of the escapees finished before the elite riders, and Nocentini retained a big enough advantage to take over the race leadership. Brice Feillu attacked the other four escapees who were at the head of the field with 5.5 km remaining, and stayed away to claim his first professional win in his first Tour de France. After an attempted attack on the other contenders for the Tour victory by Cadel Evans, 2007 winner Alberto Contador made a successful attack on the elite group with 3 km to go, beating them to the line by 21 seconds, and taking second place overall, while after five days in the yellow jersey, Cancellara finished more than nine minutes behind the stage winner, having been dropped on the final climb.\nStage 8.\n11 July 2009 — Andorra la Vella (Andorra) to Saint-Girons, 176 km\nThe Tour returned to France in the second of three Pyrenean stages, which featured three categorized climbs, including the imposing Port d'Envalira at just over 2,400 meters, before a steep descent. A number of early breakaways, including one featuring Cadel Evans, and one that enabled Thor Hushovd to take sufficient points in intermediate sprints to claim the green jersey, came to nothing, and by the top of the final climb three riders, Mikel Astarloza (later suspended for EPO use), Vladimir Efimkin and Luis León Sánchez, were at the front of the race, with an array of chasers and struggling former members of breakaways between them and a group that included all the GC contenders and the yellow jersey wearer, Nocentini, who was part of a group, also including Denis Menchov, that had recovered a 30-second deficit on the elite group shortly before the top of the climb. Meanwhile, leader and 2006 Tour winner, Óscar Pereiro, became the highest profile rider to abandon the race. On the 42 km descent, Sandy Casar caught the three leaders, and this group of four maintained a comfortable lead over the peloton, and the race among these riders was triggered when Efimkin broke clear with 4 km remaining, a move that at one stage looked as though it might succeed, but he was caught by the other three escapees just before the red kite, and Sánchez won the sprint from Casar. There was no change to the position of the race favorites.\nStage 9.\n12 July 2009 — Saint-Gaudens to Tarbes, 160 km\nThe Pyrenees portion of the 2009 Tour ended with this stage which had two categorized climbs, the Col d'Aspin and the Col de Tourmalet and, as the previous day, a lengthy flat stretch before the finish, essentially neutralising the stage in terms of challenges relevant to the overall classification. An early break of twelve riders became thirteen after extensive effort by the squad to get Franco Pellizotti across the divide. After not much more than half an hour, the escape group was reduced to four: Pellizotti, Jens Voigt, Pierrick Fédrigo and Leonardo Duque, who was dropped on the climb of the Col d'Apsin, while a chase group of 9 riders formed behind, including Egoi Martínez, who was to gain enough points over the cols to take the polkadot jersey at the end of the day. By the top of that mountain, the leading trio held an advantage of 2'45 over the counter-attack and 3'30 over the peloton; at the top of the Tourmalet only Pellizotti and Fédrigo remained at the front, with seven surviving chasers at 2'40 and the peloton at 5'05. The descent and flat run in saw all the escapees except the two leaders reeled in, as and sought to engineer an opportunity for their sprinters, but Pellizotti and Fédrigo held on to contest the stage win between themselves, the Frenchman emerging as victor.\nRest day.\n13 July 2009 — Limoges\nAfter a lengthy transfer, the rest day was spent at the site of the beginning of the next day's stage.\nStage 10.\n14 July 2009 — Limoges to Issoudun, 193 km\nThe Bastille Day stage, one of two stages on which it was intended riders will not be in radio contact with their team cars, was flat, heading to Issoudun for the first time on the Tour de France. The day's break was initiated by Thierry Hupond in the second kilometre, and he was joined by Mikhail Ignatiev and Benoît Vaugrenard, and after a hold-up at a level crossing, by Samuel Dumoulin. The group's lead never reached four minutes, but over the latter stages the peloton found the gap slow to close. The catch was finally made with a little over 1½ km left, Hupond being the last member of the breakaway to yield to the chasers, and 's train again delivered Mark Cavendish for a win in the sprint, ahead of Thor Hushovd, who retained the green jersey. It was initially announced that a split in the field meant that most of the peloton, including Levi Leipheimer and Bradley Wiggins, two of the top five in the overall classification at the beginning of the day, lost 15 seconds to the first 52 finishers, but this was rescinded the following day.\nStage 11.\n15 July 2009 — Vatan to Saint-Fargeau, 192 km\nThis was another flat stage, with a two-man breakaway, consisting of Johan Van Summeren and Marcin Sapa, which reached its largest advantage of 4'45\" after 45 km and was caught with 5 km remaining. Mark Cavendish again dominated the sprint, taking his fourth stage of the tour and regaining the green jersey."

        "text": "These were the individual stages of the 2009 Tour de France, with Stage 12 on 16 July and Stage 21 on 26 July.\nStages.\nStage 12.\n16 July 2009 – Tonnerre to Vittel, 200 km\nThis was considered a flat stage, but had six hills that contributed points towards the climbers' competition. After some unsuccessful attempts at breakaways early in the stage, after 64 km Laurent Lefèvre started a breakaway. He was followed by the leader in the polka dot jersey category, Egoi Martínez, and the third-placed rider in that category, Franco Pellizotti, along with Sylvain Calzati, Markus Fothen, and Rémi Pauriol. Ten km later, they were joined by Nicki Sørensen.\nThe peloton was led by Nocentini's team, with no effort made by the teams of the sprinters to chase down the escape group. The lead held by the escape group increased over the last 40 km, from less than four minutes to over six. With 22 km remaining, Sørensen launched an attack with only Calzati joining him. At 5.5 km, he again attacked, dropping Calzati and remaining clear to win the stage by 48 seconds.\nMark Cavendish had said that he was interested in earning stage wins rather than pursuing the points jersey. However, he increased his lead in that competition by taking points at the first intermediate sprint of the day and leading the peloton home.\nPotential GC contenders Levi Leipheimer and Cadel Evans were involved in a fall in the closing stages of the race, but as the incident was within the last 3 km they were credited with the same time as the rest of the peloton. But before stage 13, Leipheimer would abandon the race due to a broken wrist.\nStage 13.\n17 July 2009 – Vittel to Colmar, 200 km\nThis was a medium-mountain stage, with five categorized climbs, including one first category mountain, the Col du Platzerwasel. Christophe Moreau launched an attack after just 3 km, and was joined by Juan Manuel Gárate, Jens Voigt, Rigoberto Urán, Heinrich Haussler, Sylvain Chavanel and Rubén Pérez. These last three moved away from the rest of the escape on the descent from the first climb, and while the rest of the escapees returned to the peloton, the lead trio gained an advantage of 9'10\" on the second climb. Pérez was dropped on the climb of the day's highest mountain, and Haussler dropped Chavanel on its descent, and rode the last 50 km alone to win the stage more than 6½ minutes ahead of the peloton. A late attack by Amets Txurruka and Brice Feillu allowed the former to gain several minutes on the peloton, but Feillu, only 4'26\" behind the yellow jersey at the start of the day failed to keep pace with his fellow escaper, and once it was clear that he would not make a serious challenge to the overall leadership, the peloton eased its chase, and riders who had become detached from the elite group were able to rejoin the peloton, including Thor Hushovd who took enough points in the final placings to regain the green jersey. Franco Pellizotti took points on three of the five climbs, thus gaining enough points to assume leadership of the King of the Mountains classification. Simon Špilak finished the stage alone more than ¾ hour behind Haussler, but the Tour officials acknowledged that he had been delayed by errors in re-opening the roads to the public earlier than should have been done, and that this contributed to his late finish, and so he was not eliminated. Óscar Freire and Julian Dean were both hit by pellets fired from an air gun during the stage, but were able to continue on the Tour.\nStage 14.\n18 July 2009 – Colmar to Besançon, 199 km\nThis was a relatively flat stage, with a category 3 climb either side of the halfway point. A woman was killed and two other spectators injured when they were hit by a police motorcycle in Wittelsheim, the first fatality connected to the Tour since 2002.\nA fourteen-man break, initiated after 14 km, by Martijn Maaskant dominated the day's racing. The group was reduced to 12 as Mark Cavendish made a tactical decision to return to the peloton, and Jens Voigt had a puncture inefficiently repaired by the neutral service vehicle, but otherwise remained clear, with a lead that reached nearly nine minutes. Among the escapees were George Hincapie, who started the day in 28th place, 5'25\" behind the leader, and Christophe Le Mével, two places and 38 seconds further back. The team of the yellow jersey wearer Rinaldo Nocentini seemed to be unwilling or unable to defend his overall lead, and the pace of the peloton was dictated for most of the stage by , and in the latter stages by . As it became clear that day's winner would come from among the group, there were several attacks, of which the effort by Sergei Ivanov with 11 km remaining was decisive. He won the stage by 16 seconds, with the peloton recovering enough time to preserve Nocentini's tenure of the yellow jersey by 5 seconds. It was suggested that Garmin's role in preventing Hincapie gaining the overall lead was influenced by their rivalry with his , but this was denied.\nGreen jersey rivals Mark Cavendish and Thor Hushovd were in a hotly contested sprint at the head of the peloton, and although Cavendish finished ahead, he was later relegated to the last position in the peloton for \"irregular sprinting\", specifically maneuvering Hushovd toward a barricade in the final 300 meters, with a net loss of 14 points to his Norwegian rival.\nStage 15.\n19 July 2009 – Pontarlier to Verbier (Switzerland), 207 km\nThe Tour reached the Alps, with four third category climbs in the first half of the stage, and the second half featuring the second category climb on the Col des Mosses (1,445 m elevation) and the race's second mountaintop finish at Verbier in Switzerland, at about the same elevation. Tom Boonen did not start the stage, and Vladimir Efimkin, who started in the top 20 overall, withdrew about halfway through the stage. Several early attacks failed to get any lasting gap ahead of the peloton, although they did allow Franco Pellizotti to increase his lead in the climbers' competition. The longest lasting escape of the day took place after 40 km, and had a number of changes of personnel before it settled to a body of ten riders, including Mikel Astarloza who was 18th overall, 3'02\" behind the leader, at the beginning of the day, and who was \"virtual leader\" until the last 40 km. Rinaldo Nocentini's team made little effort to defend his position as overall leader, and the and teams dominated the chase to the bottom of the climb to Verbier. The breakaway was overhauled by most of the contenders for a high overall placing, with Denis Menchov the most notable absentee from the selection, Simon Špilak having survived for longest. As on the climb to Arcalis, Alberto Contador made a telling attack on the elite group, this time with 6 km remaining, and only Andy Schleck went in pursuit. Contador continued to increase his lead all the way to the line, winning both the stage and the yellow jersey. Andy Schleck came in second and took over the white jersey from Tony Martin after 13 stages. \nRest day.\n20 July 2009 – Verbier (Switzerland)\nThe second rest day took place where the previous day's stage ended.\nStage 16.\n21 July 2009 – Martigny (Switzerland) to Bourg-Saint-Maurice, 160 km\nThe return to racing after the second rest day featured two long climbs and their descents: the Col du Grand-Saint-Bernard, the highest point in this year's Tour at 2,473 meters, and the Col du Petit Saint-Bernard, at which stage the race returned to France. An early break initiated by Maxime Bouet grew to 26 members, and mountains classifications challengers Franco Pellizotti and Egoi Martínez, along with Vladimir Karpets moved clear of the group as they approached the first climb. Martínez could not stay with the other two escapees, and Pellizotti took maximum points over the pass. In the long flat passage between both passes, the two leaders were caught by the large group and together started the last climb. Just before the top of this second climb, Pellizotti and Jurgen Van den Broeck who had been leading the climb, were joined by Mikel Astarloza and Amaël Moinard. Four further escapees also remained ahead of the favourites, but among that group an attack by Andy Schleck caused an elite group in which he was joined by his brother Fränk Schleck, Alberto Contador, Bradley Wiggins, Vincenzo Nibali and Andreas Klöden. Lance Armstrong led a response, and there was no lasting split among the GC contenders apart from Cadel Evans, who failed to stay with the yellow jersey group. Pellizotti again led over the top of the climb, and in the approach to the finishing town, Astarloza broke clear with 2 km remaining to win the stage, as the four chasers caught the remnants of the lead group. Jens Voigt fell hard while descending the col du Petit-Saint-Bernard with the group of the yellow jersey, he fractured his right cheekbone and suffered a concussion, and had to abandon the Tour. However, five days after the Tour finished the UCI announced that the initial stage winner Mikel Astarloza tested positive for EPO in an out-of-competition test on June 26, eight days before the race started. Astarloza was removed from the results, and the stage win transferred to Sandy Casar.\nStage 17.\n22 July 2009 – Bourg-Saint-Maurice to Le Grand-Bornand, 169 km\nThis stage had five categorized climbs on it, including four category 1 climbs, and was regarded the queen stage of this year's Tour. The first three quarters of the stage were dominated by the consolidation of the lead in both the climbers' and sprinters' competitions. A group of 20, led by Franco Pellizotti, crossed the first hill, Cormet de Roselend, before being closed down and passed by green jersey holder, Thor Hushovd. He remained in a solo lead for more than , climbing two categorised mountains alone (Col des Saisies and Côte d'Araches) in order to gain maximum points at the intermediate sprints. Pellizotti was the first of the following group over the hills, gaining maximum of the remaining climber's points. On the second to last mountain, the Col de Romme, a series of attacks by Andy and Fränk Schleck overhauled the breakaway group, and left the Luxembourgian brothers in a lead group with yellow jersey holder Alberto Contador and his Astana team-mate Andreas Klöden. An attempted breakaway by Contador succeeded only in dropping Klöden, and the leading trio continued to extend their lead over Col de la Colombière to the finish line, where the older Schleck brother, Fränk, was allowed to take the stage win. Lance Armstrong and Vincenzo Nibali overtook Klöden in the closing kilometre, finishing more than two minutes behind the first three finishers, who took the top three places in the overall classification.\nStage 18.\n23 July 2009 – Annecy, 40 km (ITT)\nThe final time trial was held earlier in the race than is usual, and was not, as it had been for many years previously, the last stage which is competitive in terms of the overall classification. It followed a 40.5 km route around Lake Annecy, on a course that was mainly flat. A 270 m hill approximately ¾ around the course of 5% gradient would assist strong climbers in finishing closer to the typical TT specialists.\nThe riders set off in reverse order of their standing in the general classification, and the 19th rider to start, Mikhail Ignatiev set fastest times at all the intermediate checkpoints, and at the finish, that stood until Olympic time trial champion Fabian Cancellara, starting 58 riders later, bettered his times at the last checkpoint and, more importantly, at the finish line. Cancellara's finishing time, and Ignatiev's intermediate times were unchallenged until the last few riders were on the course, by which time there had been a rain shower and the wind speed had increased. Both Bradley Wiggins and Alberto Contador beat Cancellara's times at the top of the climb, and the earlier checkpoints, but lost time relative to the Swiss rider over the last part of the course. Wiggins lost 55 seconds to Cancellara in the last 12 km, and ended sixth on the stage, while Contador lost 49 seconds to him over the same distance, but still retained a three-second advantage to win the stage.\nAndy Schleck conceded 1'45\" to Contador in coming 21st on the stage, but retained his second place overall, while Lance Armstrong, 16th on the stage, moved up to third overall, with an 11-second advantage over Wiggins.\nStage 19.\n24 July 2009 – Bourgoin-Jallieu to Aubenas, 195 km\nThis was a largely flat stage, but featured a category 2 climb 16 km from the finish. A twenty-rider breakaway after 9 km never gained more than three minutes advantage over a peloton paced by and , and an attack by Leonardo Duque after 110 km reduced the group to five, his companions being José Luis Arrieta, Iván Gutiérrez, David Millar and Yaroslav Popovych. This smaller group stayed away from a chase group of about 40 riders that included all but one of the top 20 in the general classification, and some of the top sprinters in the race, for a further 35 km, but were caught before the final climb started in earnest. Near the top of that climb, Laurent Lefèvre and world champion Alessandro Ballan attempted a breakaway, but they were chased down by , whose sprinter Mark Cavendish again took the stage victory. A split in the group as it crossed the line meant that Lance Armstrong gained four seconds over the rest of the contenders for a place on the final podium in Paris.\nStage 20.\n25 July 2009 – Montélimar to Mont Ventoux, 167 km\nThis was the first time the Tour had had a mountain stage on its second-to-last day. The early stages, which included four categorised climbs, saw a group of 16 riders build a lead in excess of 10'30\" before started to limit their gains. Under pressure from , the chase group was reduced to 24 men, including the top 12 in the overall standings, when it reached the bottom of the final climb of the tour 4'05\" behind the leaders. Juan Manuel Gárate triggered the disintegration of the lead group by attacking on the lower slopes, with only Tony Martin able to stay with him for long. The yellow jersey group passed many of the members of the earlier escape as it climbed, but the seven riders who had any ambition of comprising the top three in Paris remained together for most of the climb. Andy Schleck attempted a number of attacks, but as they neither allowed him to escape from Alberto Contador, nor assisted Fränk Schleck to move clear of Lance Armstrong in his ambition to gain third place overall, he did not persist with them. Franco Pellizotti, who already had an unassailable lead in the King of the Mountains category, caught and passed the yellow jersey group in pursuit of Martin and Gárate. Among the elite group, which had been joined by Roman Kreuziger in a bid to get into the top ten in general classification, the first to lose contact was Andreas Klöden, and with 2 km remaining Bradley Wiggins became detached from the group. Gárate attacked Martin twice in the closing stages, and although the German was able to catch-up twice, the Spaniard moved clear in the last 200m to win the stage. Pellizotti was caught by the yellow jersey group in the last 200m, and although Armstrong increased his lead over Wiggins, Fränk Schleck's margin over the British rider at the line was not enough to overtake him for fourth place overall.\nStage 21.\n26 July 2009 – Montereau-Fault-Yonne to Paris Champs-Élysées, 160 km\nThe 2009 Tour ended, as it had for the previous 34 years, on the Champs-Élysées. The pace was casual in the early part of the stage, marked more by photo opportunities for the category leaders, but the pace increased once the race reached central Paris. On the first of seven circuits of the Champs-Élysées, a seven rider escape moved clear, consisting of Jussi Veikkanen, Arnaud Coyot, Samuel Dumoulin, Alexandre Pichot, Carlos Barredo, Fabian Wegmann and Fumiyuki Beppu. The breakaway nullified the intermediate sprints as part of the only unresolved contest, the green jersey category. The last three escapees, Veikkanen, Wegmann and Beppu, were caught shortly after the start of the last circuit. Although the team attempted to get ahead of the lead out, Mark Cavendish won the sprint, his sixth stage of the Tour, with several metres to spare, with his lead-out man Mark Renshaw second. Thor Hushovd, by finishing sixth, took enough points to secure the points competition, and the other riders finished in the group to confirm their positions and awards."

        "text": "The 2009–10 Clemson Tigers men's basketball team represented Clemson University in the 2009–10 college basketball season. Their head coach was Oliver Purnell. The team played its home games at Littlejohn Coliseum in Clemson, South Carolina and are members of the Atlantic Coast Conference. All games were produced and broadcast locally by the Clemson Tigers Sports Network. The Tigers finished the season 21–11, 9–7 in ACC play. They lost in the first round of the 2010 ACC men's basketball tournament. They received an at-large bid to the 2010 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, earning a 9 seed in the Midwest Region, where they defeated Saint Mary's in the first round, but lost the second round to 1 overall seed and AP #1 Kansas\nPre-season.\nOn Wednesday, May 27, guard Terrence Oglesby announced he would forgo his final two seasons at the school to pursue a professional basketball career. Oglesby appeared in 66 games and scored 777 points in his two seasons at Clemson. Previously, Oglesby played for Norway at the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship. In a press release issued by Clemson University, Oglesby indicated that his time spent playing internationally helped fuel his decision to turn pro.\nOglesby's departure left an open roster spot which was filled by the commitment of shooting guard Noel Johnson, a former USC commitment.\nOn Tuesday, August 18, ESPN announced that Clemson will serve as one of the host sites for the network's popular basketball series, College GameDay, during the 2009–10 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. Two one-hour shows (11:00 am and 8:00 pm Eastern) will originate from Littlejohn Coliseum on Jan 23, 2010 for the Clemson vs. Duke game. This is Clemson's first appearance on ESPN College GameDay. The series, which is in its sixth season, will make four first-time stops in 2010. Other first-time hosts include Illinois, Kansas State and Washington. The Clemson/Duke game will be one of two ACC tilts featured this season, with the other being North Carolina at Duke on Mar. 6.\nOn Sunday, October 26, 2008, members of the ACC Media were polled and picked Clemson to finish third in the conference behind North Carolina and Duke.\nRegular season.\nOn December 2, 2009, Illinois came back from a 23-point second-half deficit to upset the No. 18 Tigers, 76–74 at Littlejohn Coliseum. The victory was the biggest comeback win in school history and was also notable as it helped the Big Ten win their first ACC – Big Ten Challenge in eleven tries.\nOn December 6, 2009, Clemson beat rival South Carolina 72–61, extending their winning streak over the Gamecocks to six games. Carolina leads the overall series, 86–74.\nOn January 3, 2010, the No. 21 Tigers managed only 12 points in the first half as they lost to No. 7 Duke for the 13th straight time at Cameron Indoor Stadium, 74–53. Clemson had as many fouls as points in the opening period, and their scoring total and shooting percentage (5–30, 17%) were the lowest for a half in Oliver Purnell's seven years as head coach.\nOn January 13, 2010, the No. 19 Tigers ended a 10-game losing streak to North Carolina by defeating the No. 13 Tar Heels, 83–64 at Littlejohn Arena. It was the second largest margin of victory ever for the Tigers over the Tar Heels. The most being a 20-point 93–73 win in 1976–77, Tree Rollins' senior season. Clemson then followed the win with a 73–70 win at NC State, ending a streak of 13 consecutive losses in the game following a victory over a top 25 team.\nOn January 23, 2010, ESPN's College GameDay broadcast live from Littlejohn Coliseum for the first time. Afterward, GameDay host Digger Phelps said of the broadcast at Clemson: \"It was the best\". The crowd was so loud during the broadcast that the production director requested that the crowd keep the noise down when cameras were rolling. The day culminated in a 47–60 loss to Duke, the lowest point total for Duke thus far this season, and the lowest point total of a Clemson team at home since the 2003–04 season, Oliver Purnell's first at Clemson.\nPostseason.\nACC tournament.\nClemson entered the ACC tournament as the No. 6 seed with a 9–7 record in the ACC regular season. The Tigers lost their opening game to No. 11 seed NC State 59–57, dropping their record in the tournament to 16–57 all-time with 43 of their losses coming in the first round. Clemson remains the only original member of the ACC to have never won the tournament.\nNCAA tournament.\nClemson entered the tournament as the No. 7 seed in the East Region, but was knocked out in the opening round by a lower-seeded team for the third straight year, losing 86–78 to No. 10 seed Missouri. The loss dropped Oliver Purnell to 0–6 all-time in NCAA Tournament games as a head coach for three different schools.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9| Regular season\n!colspan=9| ACC tournament\n!colspan=9| 2010 NCAA men's basketball tournament\n1 – Note that rankings above 25 are not official rankings.

        "text": "Postseason coverage.\nWhen the League Championship Series was first instituted in 1969, the Major League Baseball television contract at the time allowed a local TV station in the market of each competing team to also carry the LCS games. So, for example, Mets fans in New York could choose to watch either the NBC telecast or Lindsey Nelson, Bob Murphy and Ralph Kiner on WOR-TV.\n1983 marked the last time that local telecasts of League Championship Series games were allowed. In 1982, Major League Baseball recognized a problem with this due to the emergence of cable superstations such as WTBS in Atlanta and WGN-TV in Chicago. When TBS tried to petition for the right to do a \"local\" Braves broadcast of the 1982 NLCS, Major League Baseball got a Philadelphia federal court to ban them on the grounds that as a cable superstation, TBS could not have a nationwide telecast competing with ABC's.\nSince 2007, MLB playoff games on TBS are not made available to local over-the-air broadcasters in the participating teams' markets. Under the previous contract, ESPN was required to make those games available on the air in local markets. As of 2023, Major League Baseball is currently the only \"Big Four\" league with regional broadcast rights whose entire postseason is exclusive to national television; the National Basketball Association playoffs and National Hockey League playoffs continue to air their first round games on both national and local television."

He played representative level rugby union (RU) for Wales, and at club level for Pontyclun RFC, Crawshays RFC, Army XV and London Welsh RFC, as a fullback and representative level rugby league (RL) for Great Britain, and at club level for Oldham and Broughton Rangers as a .\nBackground.\nTommy Rees was born in Pontyclun, Wales, and he died aged 64 in Oldham, Lancashire, England.\nRugby union career.\nRees was born in Pontyclun in South Wales and as a teenager played rugby for local club team Pontyclun RFC. Jack Meggins, a local headmaster from Talbot Green, saw potential in Rees and recommended him in writing to invitational team Crawshays. Crawshays accepted Rees, the first notable team in his career. Rees joined the British Army and became a soldier in the Welsh Guards, and while serving in the Guards he was selected for the Army XV.\nIn 1926, Rees was playing for Welsh exile team London Welsh, and after an excellent victory against Cross Keys at Blackheath on 6 March, Rees along with teammates Windsor Lewis and Wick Powell, was selected to face Ireland as part of the 1926 Five Nations Championship. The game was played at St. Helen's, Swansea, with the Welsh team being led by Swansea's Rowe Harding. The Wales team were victorious over Ireland, robbing the Irish of both the Triple Crown and Grand Slam. Rees scored his first international points during the game with a single conversion, and at the end of the match, the three London Welsh players were carried from the pitch shoulder-high. The press recorded that Rees had \"a great game that caused intense enthusiasm\". Rees was reselected for the next Wales international, the final game of the 1926 tournament, away to France. Now captained by Bobby Delahay, Wales won the game 7–5.\nOn Christmas Eve 1926, Rees was playing for London Welsh away to Cross Keys. In the first few minutes of the second half, while attempting a tackle, Rees broke his leg. Rees had been a certainty for the 1927 Championship, and after his injury his place was taken by Ossie Male. The next season, Rees was back in the Wales team, and was chosen to face the New South Wales Waratahs at the Cardiff Arms Park. Wales were well beaten, though Rees scored for Wales with another conversion. The selectors kept faith with Rees, and he played his final union international in the opening game of the 1928 tournament, played at Swansea against England.\nInternational matches played.\nWales (rugby union)\nRugby league career.\nHe played at representative level for Great Britain, and at club level for Oldham and Broughton Rangers, as a .\nIn 1928 while only 23, Rees decide to switch to the professional league code, and 'Went North', joining Oldham RLFC. Rees had an eleven-year career with Oldham setting many club records, including kicking 668 goals and playing 121 consecutive first team games. In 1939, towards the end of his club career, Rees joined Broughton Rangers though the outbreak of the Second World War ended the playing of professional rugby. He continued to be involved in rugby after his retirement, becoming a rugby league referee. In 1947 he became a rugby league referee and later ran the line as a touch judge in the final of the Rugby League Challenge Cup at Wembley. He was a lifelong committee man, and served Oldham until ill-health forced his retirement. Tommy Rees is one of less than twenty-five Welshmen to have scored more than 1000-points in their rugby league career. Tom Rees won a single cap for Great Britain while at Oldham in 1929 against Australia."

It conducts zone level as well as state-level age-group tournaments for Under-14, Under-16, Under-19, Under-22, and Under-25. State teams of these categories are selected through these tournaments. KCA participates in all age group tournaments conducted by the BCCI in both men's and women's categories. It also hosts national tournaments and international matches in the state. Through its program CASH-Kerala, KCA adopts and trains around 500 school children every year through its district level and state level cricket academies. Operation Gold Hunt is another program of KCA where it adopts and trains selected young athletes, to help them achieve higher goals.\nHistory.\nG. V. Raja, Consort Prince of Travancore, formed the Travancore-Cochin Cricket Association in 1950. The primary objective of the association was to popularise the game in the State of Travancore-Cochin. The formative meeting of the Travancore-Cochin Cricket Association was held in the auditorium of the Maharaja's College, Eranakulam, due to the efforts of the P. M. Krishnan and P. M. Raghavan with support from Raja. Upon its inception, the Travancore-Cochin Cricket Association selected the Travancore-Cochin first class team, which was led by P. M. Raghavan. The team played its first match in the Ranji Trophy circuit against Mysore, where the P. M. Anandan took six-wickets, conceding 100 runs in 27 overs in the first innings of the match. Following the formation of the state of Kerala in 1956, the Travancore-Cochin Cricket Association was renamed as the Kerala Cricket Association (KCA).\nThere were certain intrinsic difficulties that hindered the progress of Kerala cricket. Since the South-Western monsoon rains hit the Kerala Coast as early as the first week of June every year, the Cricketing season could only start in October as opposed to June–July in other parts of the Country. Being a small strip of land between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea, availability of land is a big challenge in the State; hence the sporting infrastructure is generally shared by multiple sports disciplines. This was a major hindrance in developing permanent turf pitches and decent outfields. The extent of the problem was so much so that till very recently the only exclusive Cricket ground in Kerala was owned by the Thripunithura Cricket Club; which is physically located in a manner which presented little or no scope for further development; in spite of the relentless efforts by the successive Club authorities. The absence of finance was a further handicap. Since there were no Stadia with the required facilities available in the State until the very recent past, the scope of hosting international matches was nonexistent. This hindered the association's efforts of raising funds. Participation of the State teams in the national tournaments like Ranji trophy usually poised a big struggle to the administrators. These predicaments were overcome only with the sheer willpower of the then administrators and to a great extent with the generous and timely financial assistance provided by philanthropists like S. V. Pandit. Gradually, however, things made a turn for the better, and through the sixties, the State participated in the various inter-school and age group tournaments run by the BCCI. The mid-nineties had been a period of eminence for Cricket in Kerala when its Ranji Trophy side qualified to the knockout stages of the tournament for the first time in the 1994/95 season. The team continued its fete in the next season as well when they qualified to the super league staged of the tournament. Players like Ananthapadmanabhan, Sunil Oasis, Feroze V Rasheed, M Suresh, Ajay Kuduva, Sreekumar Nair, Ramprakash and Sujith Somasunder had contributed profoundly to this achievement.\nThe last two decades had witnessed a paradigm shift in Kerala Cricket in both ways; performing as a team and as individuals. Beginning with pacer Tinu Yohanan's inclusion in the National side, the tempo was sustained by the inclusion of S Sreesanth later on. The present-day Kerala Cricket teams are making deep inroads in almost all BCCI tournaments as the State is slowly emerging as one of the powerhouses of Indian Cricket. This can be corroborated with the fact that as many as 7 players from the State are playing in the Indian Premier League representing different teams; of whom the teenage sensation Sanju Samson has become an icon of the emerging face of Kerala Cricket after his prolific performances in the League for the Rajasthan Royals. Sanju was chosen as the best young player in the League.\nAffiliation.\nThe Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) is one of the constituent members of the BCCI and it has fielded its team in the Ranji Trophy – India's first-class tournament, ever since the formation of the association. A lot of eminent cricket personalities from the KCA have served the game at the national level and among them, the legendary Lt. Col. Goda Varma Raja, is definitely the foremost. He was the president of Kerala Cricket association from the years 1950 to 1963 and he was also the first person from Kerala to become an office bearer in BCCI when he became its vice-president. Apart from Lt. Col. Raja, Mr. S Karunakaran Nair popularly known as SK Nair, from Kerala Cricket Association served the BCCI as the treasurer during 1993–97, as finance committee chairman during 1998–2002, and as the honorary secretary of BCCI from 2003 to 2005. He had also served the Asian Cricket Council as its treasurer and secretary. The late SV Pandit, who was the president of Travancore Cricket association till his death, had helped the Kerala Cricket Association a lot by way of financial assistance.\nLogo.\nKCA has adopted a logo similar to that of the BCCI. The basic element of the logo resembles the insignia of the Order of the Star of India. Instead of the star in the crest, a stylized image of Imperial Insignia of Sree Padmanabha's Shankha, which was the state emblem of the Kingdom of Travancore as well as the state emblem of the State of Kerala, is used.\nEminent personalities.\nLt. Col. Goda Varma Raja\nThe man who marched Kerala Cricket forward was legendary Lt. Col. Goda Varma Raja of the Travancore royal family. \"A Prince among sportsmen and a sportsman among princes\", Lt. Col. Raja was responsible for putting Kerala in the sports and Tourist maps of India. A Keen Sportsman himself he played all the games, though he had a weakness for Tennis and polo. It was his great vision that led to the development of Kovalam as one of the finest beaches in the world and the commissioning of the Trivandrum Airport. He was President of Kerala Cricket Association for 13 years from 1950 to 1963 and was the first person from Kerala to become an office-bearer of the BCCI; when he became its vice-president. He was in line to become its president but for the tragic air crash which killed him. Lt. Col. Raja still lives in the memory of all Sports lovers in the State. The G. V. Raja Pavilion in the University Stadium as well as the first and the premier sports school in Kerala are named after him. The Kerala Cricket Association has announced the launch of a National Level Tournament to sustain his memories.\nS Karunakaran Nair (SK Nair)\nSK Nair was the face of Kerala cricket for many years. He was the first from the sState to become a principal office bearer of the BCCI when he served it as its honorary treasurer from 1993 to 1997; during which period he also served as the honorary treasurer of the Kerala State Sports Council. Later he went on to serve the board as its honorary secretary from 2003 to 2005. He was the chairman of the board's finance committee from 1998 to 2002 and had also served the Asian Cricket Council as its treasurer and secretary. As a medium pacer and middle-order batsman, he had skippered the Kerala Under-25 cricket team for six years. He became the president of the Kerala Cricket Association in 2005 and went on serving it till 2007. He was a banker by profession; employed by the State Bank of Travancore from where he took voluntary retirement as a sports officer.\nFamous players.\nBy far Kerala had been able to produce only three international cricketers. However, the State had produced some very stylish players who at their times were considered as definite national prospects. While so many of them were noticed by National Selectors, many a time more prolific careers in the same speciality had proved to be a hindrance for the furtherance of their careers to the next level. One classic example is that of KN Ananthapadmanabhan; whose career was coincided with that of the legendary Anil Kumble.\nBalan Pandit\nBalan Pandit was the first star of Kerala Cricket. He was very well known in the Indian Domestic Circuit. Born in Koonammavu in Ernakulam district on 16 June 1926, Pandit had spent many years away from Kerala and had attended the prestigious King George School in Mumbai. He used to work for BEST when Lt. Col. G.V. Raja, the founder president of the Kerala Cricket Association took initiative to bring him back to Kerala. Such was his class; that it is widely believed that if Pandit had chosen to stay in Mumbai, he would have definitely played for India. A wicketkeeper-batsman, Pandit had begun his first-class career representing Kathiawar in 1946. He was the wicketkeeper for Kathiawar in the match against Maharashtra in 1948, where Bhausaheb Nimbalkar scored an unbeaten 443 runs; the highest first-class score by an Indian batsman. In a Ranji Trophy match in 1959 against Andhra; his 14th for Kerala, Pandit scored an unbeaten 262, which was the highest individual score for Kerala before Sreekumar Nair hit a triple century against Services in 2007. As a wicketkeeper, he has 35 catches and 3 stumpings in his kitty. Pandit also served as an administrator when he served KCA as its vice-president and as the Chairman of Selectors. He was also a member of India's junior selection committee. The most significant contribution of Pandit to Kerala Cricket is that it was him who had introduced the game's modern techniques and professionalism to a bunch of amateur cricketers; who at that time was merely following the sport as a recreational means.\nK N Ananthapadmanabhan\nNo chronicle of the modern-day Kerala Cricket would be complete without the name of KN Ananthapadmanabhan. He was a star in his own right. A crafty leg-spinner and a resourceful middle-order batsman, Ananthan; as he is known commonly, was widely considered as a definite Indian team probable in his playing days. But unfortunately for him, his career coincided with that of Anil Kumble's, and his appearances in the big stage were restricted to few matches against visiting overseas teams. However, he was the first player from Kerala to be selected to the India 'A' squad. During the early nineties when Kerala was usually considered as a punching bag of the South Zone bigwigs Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Hyderabad, Ananthan's top-class bowling performances were the only silver linings for Kerala. He was the one who instilled self-belief among the State's Cricketers and Kerala started winning matches by banking on his bowling capabilities. He along with M Suresh Kumar (Umbri), B Ramprakash, Sunil Oasis, and Feroz V Rasheed propelled the Kerala bowling line-up of the later nineties into a formidable one. Worth mentioning is that all of them were very competent batsmen too. He has played in 105 first-class matches, has taken 344 wickets and has scored 2891 runs including three centuries of which one was a double century. Fittingly he was the captain when Kerala qualified to the knock out stages of the Ranji Trophy Tournament for the first time in its history in 1994–95. Ananthan still continues to serve the game as Level-II coach and a Level-II Umpire. He has officiated matches in the Domestic Tournaments including the Ranji Trophy as well as in the IPL. He has also served as a Member BCCI Junior selection committee in 2006/07. His brother KN Balasubramanium has also played for the State in a few matches.\nTinu Yohannan\nTinu Yohannan became the first Player from Kerala to be selected to the National side, when he was picked up for India's home series against England in 2001. He made his debut at Mohali, where the first Test match of the series was played. His career got off the ground fabulously when he claimed his first scalp in the fourth ball of his very first over and later went on to claim the next opener as well. However, his form went on to a plunge, and eventually, he ended up playing only in three tests and as many numbers of ODIs. Tinu was trained by none other than the great Richard Hadlee at the MRF Pace Foundation and soon after he was selected to the first batch of trainees in the National Cricket Academy along with Yuvraj Singh, Gautham Gambhir, Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh, Mohammed Kaif, Shiv Sunder Das, Lakshmi Ratan Shukla, Murali Karthik, Reetinder Singh Sodhi, Ramesh Powar, Sridharan Sriram and Ajay Ratra among others. He played for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the 2009 edition of the Indian Premier League. His father, T. C. Yohannan was a Long Jumper who held the national record for nearly 3 decades and had represented India in the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada. Tinu's inclusion in the National side had created a newfound enthusiasm amongst the Kerala players which is sustained ever since. Till then it was widely believed that no one from Kerala could ever play on the National side since the State's team was very weakly placed in the Ranji Trophy table, but Tinu's inclusion had uprooted that belief as players started believing in themselves. Currently, Kerala is widely recognized as a nursery of fast bowlers in India.\nS Sreesanth\nThe first one to follow Tinu's footsteps was S Sreesanth. He had started as a leg spinner initially; however due to his good height of 6 feet 3 inches before long he had turned his attention towards fast bowling after being encouraged by his elder brother. He made his first-class and debut in Kerala's Ranji Trophy match against Goa in the 2002–03 domestic season, claiming 22 wickets in seven matches a performance which helped him to get selected to the South Zone side in the Duleep Trophy squad in the same season. He was selected to the India-A side in a tour match against the visiting New Zealand side in Rajkot, where he took just one wicket in twelve overs after being constrained by a hamstring injury. In November 2004, Sreesanth entered the record books when he took a hat-trick against Himachal Pradesh in a Ranji trophy game. He was selected to play for India B in the Challenger Trophy in October 2005, where he performed impressively and eventually winning the Man of the Series award. This had led to his selection in the National side for the home ODI series against Sri Lanka.\nSreesanth's name is perhaps the most bountiful in Kerala's and perhaps even in the National Sports Circuit for both good and bad reasons. While most of the sports personalities are remembered for their performances and achievements in their respective sports disciplines, Sreesanth is mostly known for his exploits both inside and outside the playing arena. Sreesanth's emotional antics have led him to be regarded by some observers as eccentric. He had been penalized on a number of occasions for breaching the International Cricket Council's as well as the BCCI's Code of Conduct. The Kerala Cricket Association had issued him with a stern warning in the past after he went to inaugurate a college dance competition instead of reporting to the Ranji Trophy Preparatory Camp. The tide of public sentiments was immensely antagonistic on him initially following the Delhi Police booked him for his alleged involvement in the IPL spot-fixing. However, some later developments and certain observations made by the courts had caused the animosities to recede and in place of the loathing, the public became more compassionate towards him; at least in the State. Support groups were formed to declare their trust and support to him and his family when he was jailed briefly during the period. Though he had never been a regular constituent in the National Side, he had been part of some of the most famous Indian victories; notably in the finals of both the World Cups which India had won recently – the ICC World Cup 2011 and the ICC T20 World Cup 2007.\nSanju V Samson\nKerala had traditionally had produced some very fine bowlers. But except a very few from the past like Balan Pandit, no batsmen had really made their presence felt in the national scene till very recently. Sanju is essentially one of the finest batsmen Kerala has ever produced and is a fine wicket-keeper too; though he is better known for his batting skills. He had announced his arrival at a very early age of 12 by scoring 900 runs including 4 centuries in 5 matches of the South Zone U-13 tournament hosted by the Karnataka State Cricket Association. Later, he had led the U-16 and U-19 sides of the State with distinction, where his performances with both the bat and glove had helped Kerala to secure a place in the Elite league of the Cooch Behar Trophy. He made his first-class debut in 2011 at the age of 16. He was included in the Indian U-19 squad for the Asia cup; where his performance was poor. 2013 had been particularly good for Sanju as he had scored 2 first-class centuries and was drafted to the IPL team Rajasthan Royals under the stewardship of the great wall Rahul Dravid. Sanju had performed well with both the bat and gloves in the tournament and had won the best young player of the League. Sanju was chosen as the vice-captain of the Indian U-19 side touring Australia. In 2013 he was picked into the India A side who played the touring New Zealand A team. In 2014, he was made the Vice-captain of the U-19 Indian team for the Asia Cup side which was played in UAE. Later on, in the same year, he was picked up to the India A side which toured in Australia for participating in a quadrangular tournament. Sanju could prove his worth in the triangular series where he emerged as the top run-getter for the team even while batting in the 7th place. His performance was crucial for the team in winning the title and this led to his inclusion in the Senior India squad for the ODI series in England; making him only the third player from the State to achieve fate.\nFamous officials.\nJose Kurishinkal\nJose Kurishinkal was the first First-class as well as international umpire from Kerala. An engineer by profession, Jose was a good leg-spinner during his playing days. He has officiated in 3 ODIs as on-field umpire and in 1 as the TV umpire. Apart from these, he had officiated in 19 First-class matches, 10 List-A matches, and numerous junior matches. He was widely regarded as a good umpire and it was widely believed in the circuit that he would be appointed to officiate in Test matches; if not he had not chosen to retire earlier for pursuing his engineering career oversees. Jose was instrumental in mentoring budding Umpires and even today he gets involved in umpire training. He had also served as the secretary of the Trivandrum District Cricket Association. Following Jose's footsteps, two more Umpires from Kerala; Dandapani Sankaralingam and Dr. K. N. Raghavan, had officiated in international matches.\nMISSION – 2020.\nKCA had published its revised vision document – MISSION-2020 in 2007. The document replaced an earlier vision document which was released in 2005 called Vsion-2010.\nMission statement:\nMISSION – 2020– is a master plan that is guaranteed to change the profile of the game in the state, by the year 2020. It envisages the following:-\nCASH-Kerala, Cricket@School and Talent Hunt.\nCASH-Kerala (Cricket Academies and Sports Hostels) and Cricket@School are two programs launched by KCA to promulgate the official cricketing circuit among the young children of the state. It is one of the most ambitious projects undertaken by any of the state associations in the BCCI, so much so that almost 50% of KCA's income is spent on identifying and nurturing Cricketing talents at a very early age. These programs have created a new momentum in Kerala's junior cricket scenario.\nCASH-Kerala\nCASH-Kerala was launched in 2009. Under this umbrella, KCA runs 1 State Academy for College Boys, 5 State Level Academies for Higher Secondary Boys, 1 State Level Academy for Higher Secondary Girls, 1 State Level Academy for School Boys, 2 State Level Academies for School Girls and 15 District Academies. Altogether these academies have adopted more than 400 boys and girls. Every Academy is residential and employs a full-time Coach and a warden. KCA bears the cost of Boarding, Cricket clothing, and equipment, Food, and Conveyance of the trainees and the staff members. Every year, the selection process for admission to the academies is done painstakingly done. From a very large number of hopefuls who turns up at the selection trials, only the best and most talented of them make the cut. They are put through the grind by a panel of experienced coaches and veteran players and the final batch is selected to undergo training at CASH–Kerala academies, an acronym for Cricket Academies and Sports Hostels.\nTalent Hunt\nTalent Hunt is another ambitious program launched by the KCA to expand the talent base of the game in the State. This runs in parallel with the academies and aims at bringing students who wish to continue as day scholars rather than joining the residential academies. Qualified coaches impart regular training at select centers which are overseen Centrally.\nCentre of Excellence\nThe KCA Centre of excellence is envisaged as an extension of the Talent Hunt project; where specialist academies are run for individual skill sets of the game. The camps are designed to enhance the skill levels of the trainees in their chosen area and aimed at the overall development of the player. The program also looks at improving the knowledge base of the coaches.\nCricket@School\nKCA has constructed practice facilities and has appointed part-time Coaches in more than 500 schools across the state as part of the Cricket@School program. One of the most conspicuous features of the program is the yearly seminars organized for the Physical Education Teachers in every District. Interested Teachers are also trained in rendering Cricket Coaching to their wards in the respective schools. On top of this, an annual Inter-School Tournament is organized by the KCA. The Tournament is conducted in four different Levels; Education District Level, Revenue District Level, Zone Level, and finally in the State Level. Winners and Runner ups of the lower levels qualify to play in the higher levels. The tournament engages the participation of about 1000 Schools; where about 15,000 children play at least one game in the official circuit every year. The event is probably one of the largest Periodic Cricketing Events in the world. Apart from this, KCA has started to distribute free softball equipment to schools to attract more girl children to the game. Summer coaching camps previously organized by the District Associations are now organized and monitored centrally by KCA to bring in common standards of Coaching across the State.\nPlaying grounds.\nInternational Stadium\nGreenfield International Stadium, Thiruvananthapuram, University Stadium (Thiruvananthapuram), and the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium, Kochi have hosted international matches. However, these grounds are not owned by KCA nor they are exclusive Cricket Grounds. This has created numerous headaches while hosting National and International matches. As part of its efforts to own its own exclusive ground, In 2009, KCA entered into a long-term lease with the Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) to operate the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium (JNIS).KCA signed an MOU with KSFL to maintain and utilize the stadium for a stipulated period.\nFirst Class Grounds\nEndeavor to build exclusive First Class Cricket grounds in all districts is one of the major initiatives undertaken by the KCA. Under this earnest initiative, the association has made 9 grounds operational across the State and has purchased land to construct grounds in four districts. KCA plans to commission at least two grounds every year till the goal is reached. These grounds are developed in either own land or in lands belonging to clubs or educational institutions on long-term understanding. With this, the association intends to put an end to the dearth of turf wickets and decent outfields in the State. A dedicated civil engineering wing under a project coordinator oversees these activities.\nKCA OWNED STADIUMS\nKRISHNAGIRI STADIUM- WAYANAD,\nKCA CRICKET STADIUM - MANAGALAPURAM\nKCA CRICKET STADIUM - THODUPUZHA\nKCA CRICKET STADIUM - KASARGODE\nSTADIUMS WITH MOU\nGREEN FIELD STADIUM - TRIVANDRUM \nST XAVIERS COLLEGE-KCA CRICKET GROUND-THUMBA-TRIVANDRUM\nRAJAGIRI STADIUM-ERNAKULAM\nST PAULS COLLEGE GROUND - ERNAKULAM\nKCA CRICKET STADIUM - PERINTHALMANNA - MALAPPURAM\nTHALSSERY CRICKET STADIUM - THALSSERY\nOffice bearers.\nMr. B Vinodkmar is the new president of the association and its representative to the BCCI, Mr. Jayesh George is the secretary and Adv. Sreejith V Nair is the treasurer.\nControversies.\nThe Greenfield International Stadium was announced as the venue for the India West Indies cricket match to be conducted on 1 November 2018 during West Indies tour of India. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)'s tour and programme committee which met in Mumbai has allotted five one-day international matches between India and West Indies in Mumbai, Indore, Guwahati, Pune and Thiruvananthapuram. But Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) has decided to choose Kochi over Thiruvananthapuram.\nThe Kerala Cricket Association's insistence on having the match at Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium in Kochi ignited a furor after the football-loving community lodged their strong protest against the move which even saw online campaign #SaveKochiTurf.\nThey felt that KCA's decision to reconstruct pitches at the JNI stadium will damage the turf laid for the U-17 World Cup last year. They also felt that staging the ODI in November would jeopardize the home fixtures of Kerala Blasters and playing on a revamped surface would put players to the risk of injuries. Sports personalities, including Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, IM Vijayan, Sunil Chhetri, CK Vineeth, Ian Hume, came out against KCA move and the Sports Minister of the state held a meeting with KCA officials.\nFinally, Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) climbed down from its adamant stand of hosting India vs West Indies ODI in Kochi and agreed to have the match in Thiruvananthapuram."

The association was founded in 1934 and has been affiliated to the BCCI ever since.\nThe HCA operates the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in Hyderabad, which hosts International level Test, ODI and T20 cricket matches.\nHistory.\nThe people of Hyderabad were introduced to cricket by the British Army. Around 1880 cricket started to take roots in the city. Mr.N. Ganesan, erstwhile Joint Secretary of Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) traced origins of serious cricket in the city by interacting with S.M. Hadi, S.R. Mehta, Nooh Abbasi, cricketers and organizers of yesteryears whose peers were the originators of the game in the city.\nBefore the Moin-ud-Dowlah Gold Cup Tournament began in 1930/31 there is no record of any first-class cricket at Hyderabad. Raja Lochan Chand was reported to be the first chief patron of the game in late 19th century and early 20th century and Masood Ahmed, Ahmed Ali, Nazeer Baig and Khurshid Baig were few cricketers to distinguish themselves.\nOxford University Authentics that toured India in 1902/03 season was the first foreign team to visit and play at Hyderabad. As the matches they played at Hyderabad were not deemed first class cricket, there is no official record for reference.\nThe game was gradual to gain popularity. In the decade of the 20s &amp; 30s quadrangular tournaments between the Hindus, Muslims, Europeans and Parsees were instrumental in popularizing the game amongst the masses throughout the country and Hyderabad was no exception. Despite appeal of Mahatma Gandhi to end communal polarization in sport the Quadrangular/ Pentangular tournaments continued to thrill masses until 1947 and popularized the game of cricket encouraging youngsters to take-up the sport seriously.\nAt Hyderabad Educational institutions like Nizam's College, Medical College, Madarsa-I-Aliya also pioneered the cause of cricket by encouraging it amongst the students. Nawab Moin-ud-Dowla, Maharaja Kishan Pershad, Nawab Salar Jung Bahadur patronized the game and initiated tournaments for schools, educational institutions and clubs. Private Clubs like HUCC and SUCC, formed by cricket enthusiasts became prominent and cricket leagues were established.\nThanks to the patronage and efforts of Nawab Moin-ud-Dowla Bahadur, first class cricket came to Hyderabad in 1930/31 with Moin-ud-dowla Gold Cup. Three teams participated in the tournament. They were Hyderabad, Maharaj Kumar of Vizianagaram XI and Nawab of Moin-ud-Dowla XI. The people of Hyderabad witnessed world class players for the first time in Jack Hobbs and Bert Sutcliffe (English Test Stars) alongside a number of famous players from Indian First Class Circuit in CK Nayudu, Wazir Ali, JG Nalve, Amar Singh and Naoomal Jaoomal who went on to represent India in its first ever test match at Lords against England in the summer of 1932.\nIn 1933/34 MCC under the captaincy of Douglas Jardine toured India to play 3 test matches. On 25 January 1934 MCC played at Hyderabad against Nawab of Moin-ud-Dowla XI on Gymkhana Grounds. MCC was the first official overseas touring team to play at Hyderabad and present world class cricket to its people. Hyderabad witnessed the performance of Hedley Verity, the slow left arm orthodox spin bowler of MCC, a veteran of 40 test matches, claiming 5/63 in the first innings and 3/78 in the second innings of the drawn match at Hyderabad against star studded Nawab of Moin-ud-Dowla XI, which included Mushtaq Ali, Lala Amarnath and CS Nayudu the debutants of 1933/34 test series against England.\nThanks to the patronage of Nawab Moin-ud-Dowla Bahadur and the tournament, the general standard of the game improved tremendously producing many promising cricketers.\nIn the year 1934 Ranji Trophy National First Class Cricket Championships were being initiated in India. There was a need for local officiating body to imbibe organization into Hyderabad Cricket. In April 1934 Hyderabad Cricket Association was formed by Nadir Shah Chenoy, DN Dittia, Ganesh Rao, Hussain Ali Khan, S.Ali Raza, Mahmood Hussain Khan, P F Durrand, Dattatriya and Rangannah. They elected Nawab Turab Yar Jung as its first President and S.M.Hadi as Secretary.\nThus from 1934 until date Hyderabad Cricket Association has been the custodians of the game of cricket and keepers of sacred code in Hyderabad.\nUnder several eminent Cricketing personalities like, Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, Abbas Ali Baig, M.L. Jaisimha, Syed Abid Ali, Mohammad Azharuddin, Shivlal Yadav,\nVenkatapathy Raju, VVS Laxman, Pragyan Ojha, Ambati Rayudu, Hanuma Vihari, etc., the Hyderabad Cricket Association blossomed into an effective governing body and nurtured the sport of cricket efficiently within its domain by creating ample vistas for cricketers and their dreams of national &amp; international glory.\nIn September 2019, Mohammad Azharuddin elected as the President of Hyderabad Cricket Association.\nHome Stadium.\nHCA's previous home ground was the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium in the Fateh Maidan sports complex at Basheerbagh in central Hyderabad. The ground belonged to the Sports Authority of Telangana State, and HCA had limited operating autonomy there. Moreover, due to its small size, it was known as a high-scoring ground and so Hyderabad was not considered for many high-profile cricket matches in India.\nIn 2003, the proposal for a new stadium was submitted by HCA to the government of Andhra Pradesh. The government identified a large piece of land suitable for the project at Uppal. By 2005, when most of the stadium was built, it was ready to host its first ODI Match between India and South Africa. The stadium was named in the memory of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.\nIn November 2019, Indian cricketer Ambati Rayudu accused HCA of \"rampant corruption and politics in selection of teams\" and declined to play for the team in that season's Ranji Trophy, following his recent deselection from the Indian national team.\nTelangana T20 Premier League.\nHCA started Telangana T20 League in December 2017 with launching of Kaka T20 tournament across the state.\nCurrent Office Bearers.\nOmbudsman: Justice L Nageswara Rao \nAdministrator: K Durga Prasad \nCEO: Sunil Kante "

The board was formed in 1940 as the Holkar Cricket Association.\nIt is one of the Cricket Governing provincial units affiliated with the Board of Control for Cricket in India.\nMPCA has been an affiliate of the BCCI since the 1940s.\nIn the recent past, MPCA has contributed to the careers of Indian cricketers like Col. C.K. Nayudu, Capt. Mushtaq Ali, Narendra Hirwani, Rajesh Chouhan, Amay Khurasiya, Naman Ojha, among others.\nMPCA is a regular participant in all domestic tournaments conducted by the BCCI. MPCA is the only provincial unit in India that has two International venues under its control. Both venues have contemporary facilities for International cricket matches.\nMPCA has hosted 22 One Day International games and 2 IPL matches. Before 2001, Nehru Stadium was the venue for hosting ODI as Indore. The first-ever Ranji Trophy final under floodlights was played at Capt. Roop Singh Stadium in April 1997. The India Vs West Indies ODI in December 2011 saw Virender Sehwag reach 219 runs.\nMPCA was associated with two of the milestones in the cricketing career of Sachin Tendulkar. He scored his ten thousandth run during the ODI played at Indore against Australia in 2001 and became the first male cricketer to score a double century in ODI against South Africa at Gwalior in 2010. Virender Sehwag made 219 runs in an ODI in 2011 against the West Indies in Indore.\nBefore the Lodha Committee Reforms, the Association was led by Jyotiraditya M Scindia, Sanjay Jagdale and Milind Kanmadikar, who had to discontinue due to disqualification conditions as per Lodha Reforms.\nHistory.\nMadhya Pradesh Cricket Association is a body controlling and governing the game of cricket in the State of Madhya Pradesh. MPCA is an affiliated unit of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).\nA look at the transition of MPCA will take us back to the year 1932 when the Central India Cricket Association came into existence. Later on, the Holkar Cricket Association from 1940–41 to 1954–55, Madhya Bharat (1955 – 57) and subsequently the Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association from 1957 till date.\nBefore the Indian Independence, Indore, earlier known as Indore, was a princely state under the control of the Holkar Dynasty. Indore was the hub of cricket activities during that era.\nLate HH MaharajaYeshwantrao Holkar II of Indore State was a great cricket aficionado and was keen to extend royal benevolence to cricket and upcoming cricketers. To boost up the local cricket set-up, he invited prominent players like Col. C K Nayudu, Bhausaheb Nimbalkar, Chandu Sarawate, C S Nayudu, Khandu Rangnekar, Hiralal Gaekwad and Kamala Bhandarkar to play cricket for his team – The Holkars. Capt. S Mushtaq Ali, Major M M Jagdale, and J N Bhaya were the local talent in his team. He also offered them job opportunities in his army. He was, perhaps, the only royal head who continued to extend necessary support to cricket and the cricketers but never played the game himself.\nCol. C K Nayudu was the captain of the Indian side for the first-ever test played in the year 1932 against England. The batting elegance of Syed Mushtaq Ali can be gauged from the fact that he was the first Indian to score a Test century on foreign soil, against England at Manchester in 1936).\nThese great cricketers played a pivotal role in the development of the game in this part of the country. With enthusiastic support from local players like Syed Mushtaq Ali, Madhavsinh Jagdale, J N Bhaya, Rameshwar Pratap Singh and others, the Holkar team appeared to be invincible.\nDuring the period of fifteen years from 1940–41 to 1954–55, the Holkar team won the coveted Ranji Trophy on four occasions – 1945/46, 1947/48, 1950/51 and 1952/53. Moreover, they were the runner-up on six occasions in 1944/45, 1946/47, 1949/50, 1951/52, 1953/54 and 1954/55. This breathtaking record just suggests the strength of the Holkar team.\nSubsequently, the end of the Holkar era created a vacuum in Madhya Pradesh Cricket for a few years. Though good cricketers were emerging on a regular basis, the team could not perform consistently. Players like Bhagwandas Suthar, Subodh Saxena, Sanjay Jagdale, Narendra Menon, Ashok Jagdale, Vijay Nayudu, Syed Gulrez Ali, Manohar Sharma, Ashwini Chaturvedi gave a glimpse of their talent and were amongst the leading domestic players knocking for a berth in the Indian side.\nWith support from BCCI and the influx of young players, the MP team started performing as a cohesive unit and qualified regularly for the knock-out phase of the Ranji Tournament during the period from 1971 to 1980. However, the team could not replicate the winning performance of the Holkar team.\nEfforts on part of MPCA helped in laying the development pathway for the next generation of cricketers. Regular tournaments, upgradation of infrastructure, talent identification processes, the appointment of seasoned coaches, services from professional players and other measures were adopted in tandem to reach the desired goals.\nPlayers like Narendra Hirwani, Rajesh Chauhan, J P Yadav, Amay Khurasiya, and Naman Ojha to name a few, gained the benefits of these efforts on part of MPCA and marked a place in Indian cricket with their performances.\nLate HH Maharaja Madhavrao Scindia of Gwalior, President – BCCI, A W Kanmadikar, Secretary – BCCI, Late Madhavsinh Jagdale, Sanjay Jagdale, Narendra Hirwani (All National Selectors), Narendra Menon, Sudhir Asnani (International Umpires) Dr. Uma Sengar (chairperson, GDA) have emerged from this system. Sanjay Jagdale was secretary of the BCCI from MPCA.\nDivisional Activities.\nThroughout the ten divisions which come under MPCA, it conducts cricketing activities in all ten divisions on a regular basis. Apart from having International Grounds at Indore and Gwalior, MPCA has its own Cricket facilities at Sagar, Rewa, Hoshangabad, Morena and Jabalpur."

Bombay High Court in December 2010 held that \"the present petitioner (CAB) never claimed to be successor of BCA Patna (which represented Bihar in BCCI before bifurcation) and BCA Patna has already given up its challenge to the recommendations of the committee that JSCA is the changed name of BCA (1935). It is, therefore, necessary for the petitioner to apply for an affiliate membership at the first instance and then seek promotion as an associate member and thereafter full member. The Rules and Regulations are binding and the BCCI must follow the said Rules\"\nBCA timeline.\nThe Association of Bihar Cricket and Cricket Association of Bihar on 11 July 2012 charged the Lalu Prasad Yadav-led Bihar Cricket Association of committing financial irregularities to the tune of 5 million, which the BCCI had granted for development of the game in the state in 2008. The Bihar government had dissolved the BCA on grounds of irregularities in December 2008.\nReferences.\nhttps://www.bhaskar.com/bihar/patna/news/bihar-has-earned-a-name-in-cricket-for-two-decades-neither-sports-nor-players-5910538.html"

        "text": "Women's ice hockey tournaments have been staged at the Olympic Games since 1998. Eight goaltenders and fifty-three skaters have played for Canada.\nMen's ice hockey had been introduced at the 1920 Summer Olympics, and added to the Winter Olympic Games in 1924. In July 1992, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to approve women's hockey as an Olympic event first to be held at the 1998 Winter Olympics. Until 1998, Canada's national team had domonated women's hockey. Canadian teams had won every World Championship; however, by 1997, the American team had improved and was evenly matched with Canada. In thirteen games played between the two teams in 1997, Canada won seven and the United States won six. Canada and the United States dominated the preliminary round of the 1998 tournament, and in their head-to-head match up, the United States won 7–4. The two teams met in the gold medal final, which the United States won 3–1. The Canadian and American teams continued their rivalry, and in a rematch between the two at the 2002 Winter Olympics, Canada won 3–2. In 2006, the Canadian team started the tournament by outscoring opponents 36–1 over three games. American defenceman Angela Ruggiero accused the team of running up the score and warned that the event's Olympic status could be called into question due to a perceived lack of competitive teams. In the final, Canada beat Sweden to claim their second consecutive gold medal. In 2010, the Canadian and American teams outscored opponents in the preliminary round by 41-2 and 31-1 margins, respectively. This brought on more criticism about uneven competition. René Fasel said the IIHF would consider adding a mercy rule to future tournaments. In the gold medal game, Canada defeated the American team 2-0 to win their third consecutive gold. In 2014, the talent disparity had gotten smaller, with Canada and the United States only outscoring their opponents 11-2 and 14-4 in the preliminary round, respectfully. Nevertheless, Canada and the United States once again faced off in the gold medal game. Canada, on the shoulders of two goals from Marie-Philip Poulin came back from a 3-2 deficit late in the 3rd period to claim the gold medal for the fourth consecutive time. In 2018, the United States had their own come-from-behind victory, winning their first gold medal in 20 years. The deciding goal came in a shootout on a beautiful move by American forward Jocelyne Lamoureux.\nCanada has won four gold medals and two silver medals in women's hockey. The Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame has inducted the 2002 and 2006 gold medal winning teams. Cassie Campbell was the first female hockey player inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame or any national hall of fame in 2007. Hayley Wickenheiser will be inducted into the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) Hall of Fame in May 2019. Two women have participated in five tournaments and won five medals (four gold and one silver)—Jayna Hefford, and Hayley Wickenheiser. Wickenheiser is the all-time leading scorer in the women's tournament at the Olympics, with 18 goals, 33 assists and 51 points."

The team is coached by Andrew Tank, he is in his 7th year at Iowa State. The Cyclones play their home meets at Veenker Memorial Golf Course on Iowa State's campus.\nHistory.\nThe Iowa State men's golf team first got it start in 1923 in the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association conference. After three years the MVIAA dropped men's golf as a sponsored sport. When the Big Six sponsored golf in 1935, Iowa State joined once again. The early Cyclone squad were led by Coach Hugo Otopalik who split his time between Iowa State golf and wrestling. As a pioneer in the field of collegiate golf, OtopaliK was tournament director at the first NCAA golf championship held at the Wakonda Country Club in Des Moines in 1939 and was the first chairman of the NCAA golf committee. His best squads were headlined by brothers Billy and Max Hall; culminating with Big Six conference titles for Billy and Max in 1939 and 1941 respectively and a seventh-place finish in the 1940 NCAA Championship.\nAfter struggling to find success for almost half a century the Cyclones were able to reach the NCAA Regionals in seven out of nine years from 1991 to 1999. Several of those 1990s were led by Jason Knutzon who would go on to play in both the U.S. Open and The Open Championship.\nUnder current head coach, Andrew Tank, Iowa State is experiencing success both individually and as a team. Nate McCoy finished tied for 29th at the 2012 NCAA Championship, the highest individual finish in program history. In 2014 the team would reach the NCAA Finals for the first time in over 50 years, they finished tied for 25th\nVeenker Memorial Golf Course.\nNamed for George F. Veenker, head football coach at Iowa State from 1931 to 1936. He was also Athletic Director from 1933 until 1945. The golf course was completed in 1938 and given its current name in 1959.\nThe 6,543-yard, par-72, George Veenker Memorial Golf Course is located just two blocks north of the Iowa State campus. The 18-hole course was constructed in 1938 from the design of world-renowned golf course architect, Perry Maxwell (re-designer of the seventh and 10th holes at Augusta National Golf Club in 1937). The golf course was built with WPA and Athletic Council funds, and cost $122,373. The course hosted the conference championships in 1982 and 1989, two regional AIAW championships, and hosts the annual Iowa Masters Championship. It also hosted the 1949 NCAA national championship, in which Arnold Palmer was a participant.\nThe team practices at the newly opened $2 million Golf Performance Center located three miles from campus. The 16-acre facility was designed by world renowned architech Keith Foster to be used exclusively by the Iowa State men's and women's golf team."

        "text": "The 2008–2009 Connecticut Huskies men's basketball team represented the University of Connecticut in the 2008–2009 NCAA Division I basketball season. Coached by Jim Calhoun, the Huskies played their home games at the XL Center in Hartford, Connecticut, and on campus at the Harry A. Gampel Pavilion in Storrs, Connecticut. The Huskies were members of the Big East Conference.\nThe Huskies finished the season 31–5, 15–3 in Big East play to finish in a tie for second place. They lost to Syracuse in the quarterfinals of the Big East tournament. In the NCAA tournament, the Huskies received a No. 1 seed in the West Region and advanced to their third Final Four with wins over Chattanooga, Texas A&amp;M, No. 17 Purdue, and No. 9 Missouri. In the Final Four at Ford Field, they lost to No. 8 Michigan State 82–73\nRoster.\nListed are the student athletes who are members of the 2008–2009 team.\nRegular season.\nThe Huskies' season began with the team ranked No. 2 in the AP Poll. behind the University of North Carolina. Off to a quick start, UConn opened with a string of eleven straight victories over non-conference opponents, including a sweep of the Paradise Jam tournament in the U.S. Virgin Islands. During this stretch, the Huskies faced three teams that were ranked in the Top 25, including No. 8 Gonzaga in an overtime thriller in Seattle.\nThe first Big East Conference game of the season came at home against Georgetown, which the Huskies lost 74–63. This was the start of a 19-game stretch where 18 of the games were against conference opponents, and where their opponents were ranked in nine of the games. After this first loss, the Huskies went on to win 13 straight, staying comfortably atop the Big East Conference standings. Among these was a 68–51 victory at No. 7 Louisville— the eventual outright Big East Champions.\nThe Huskies reached No. 1 in the rankings on February 2, 2009, and held it for three weeks. During this span junior guard Jerome Dyson, one of the team's biggest scoring threats and its best guard defender, injured his knee. He would not be able to play for the rest of the season. The team spent the final few weeks of the regular season adjusting to their smaller rotation. A 76–68 loss at home to No. 4 Pittsburgh knocked them from the top spot. They would win their next three games, including at No. 8 Marquette, which was Coach Jim Calhoun's 800th career victory in Division I basketball. After one week at No. 2, UConn was again No. 1 in the polls, until a loss at No. 3 Pittsburgh to finish the regular season once again bumped the Huskies from the top.\nThe Huskies finished the regular season with 27 wins and 3 losses, with a conference record of 15–3. The team was not ranked out of the top 5 in the AP Poll at any point in the season.\nPost-season.\nIn the quarterfinals of the Big East tournament, UConn took on Syracuse. The game would prove to be a historic event, as it took a Big East record six overtimes before Syracuse ultimately triumphed, 127–117. The contest is tied as the second longest in NCAA Division I history.\nThe Huskies earned the No. 1 seed in the West Regional of the NCAA tournament. They began play in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where they had two blowout victories against Chattanooga and Texas A&amp;M. They moved on to Glendale, AZ for the West regionals, first defeating Purdue 72–60, then outlasting a pressing Missouri squad in the Elite Eight, 82–75.\nThe following weekend the Huskies were in Detroit, MI for a Final Four matchup against the Midwest's No. 2 seed, Michigan State. The game was close throughout, until the Spartans began to take control near the ten-minute mark of the second half. UConn would make one last run and cut the deficit to three late in the game, but Michigan State made key free throws and held on to win, 82–73. UConn's final record was 31 wins and 5 losses.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=|Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=|NCAA tournament\nPostseason awards.\nSecond Team All-America:\nHasheem Thabeet, Center, Jr.\nNational Defensive Player of the Year\nHasheem Thabeet\nBig East Co-Players of the Year:\nHasheem Thabeet\nwith DeJuan Blair, Pittsburgh, Center, So.\nBig East Defensive Player of the Year: \nHasheem Thabeet\nAll-Big East First Team:\nHasheem Thabeet\nAll-Big East Second Team:\nA.J.

        "title": "2009 Singapore Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2009 Singapore Grand Prix (formally the 2009 Formula 1 SingTel Singapore Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held at the Marina Bay Street Circuit in Singapore on 27 September 2009. The 61-lap race was the fourteenth round of the 2009 Formula One season. It was the second Singapore Grand Prix to be part of a Formula One Championship and the tenth Singapore Grand Prix overall. It was also the second Formula One race to be held at night. The race was won by McLaren-Mercedes driver and reigning World Champion Lewis Hamilton. Toyota's Timo Glock finished second and 2008 race winner Fernando Alonso took third position, making this the only race of the season with neither a Brawn nor a Red Bull driver on the podium. This was also the last race of 2009 for Glock, as he was injured during qualifying for the and was replaced by test driver Kamui Kobayashi. Heikki Kovalainen scored his last World Championship points at this race, as did second-placed Glock.\nAs a consequence of the race, Championship leader Jenson Button extended his lead by one point finishing in fifth, one position ahead of Brawn teammate and Championship rival Rubens Barrichello. Fellow rival Sebastian Vettel had been challenging Hamilton for the lead before a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pitlane scuppered his strategy.\nReport.\nBackground.\nFernando Alonso of Renault was the only previous winner of the race but recent controversy over last year's victory surrounded the race. Last year's pole sitter Felipe Massa sat out the race with injuries sustained in the Hungarian Grand Prix. The previous street circuit races this year were won by Brawn GP with Jenson Button taking the chequered flag in Monaco and Rubens Barrichello victorious in Valencia.\nPrior to the race, Button led the Championship by 14 points from teammate Barrichello, with Brawn's closest challenger Sebastian Vettel lying 12 points behind the Brazilian and 26 behind Button. Kimi Räikkönen of Ferrari was looking for a fifth consecutive podium, having scored three quarters of his 40 2009 championship points in the previous four races.\nBrawn led the Constructors' Championship on 146 points (and could have clinched the Constructors' title in Singapore), whilst Red Bull were 40.5 behind on 105.5. Ferrari and McLaren were 3rd and 4th respectively.\nThe circuit was also reprofiled slightly, including modifications to turns 1, 2, 3, 13 and 14 to aid overtaking, and also at turn 10 where high kerbs caused many accidents in 2008. The entrance and exit to the pit lane were also changed. The cars entered the pit lane before turn 22 while the most significant change was the exit of the pits with the cars now joining after turn 1. As a result, the total length of the circuit increased by 6 metres.\nTurns 1, 7 and 10 were now known as \"Sheares\", \"Memorial\" and \"Singapore Sling\" respectively. The namesake of these names are as follows: \"Sheares\" is named after the Benjamin Sheares Bridge that spans on the expressway above the circuit, which is in turn named after ex-President of the Republic Benjamin Sheares. \"Memorial\" is named after the WWII War Memorial in the middle of the city, and \"Singapore Sling\" is the name of Singapore's signature drink.\nAnnounced on Thursday evening (UTC) that title sponsor ING and Mutua Madrileña had terminated their sponsorship deals with Renault with immediate effect. This move followed the previous year's Singapore Grand Prix race-fixing scandal that resulted in a suspended ban for the team. Renault removed the sponsors' logos from their cars before they ran them on track. Mutua Madrileña continued however to back and World Champion Fernando Alonso.\nPractice.\nThe first session of the weekend ended as the previous race finished with the two Brawns on top, Rubens Barrichello in front of Jenson Button. Renault's Romain Grosjean caused the session to be stopped after losing control of the car at the same corner that Nelson Piquet Jr. crashed out during the race at last year's event. Adrian Sutil and Heikki Kovalainen were the others who had on track incidents. Fernando Alonso split the two Red Bull's in fourth, Mark Webber finished the session in third and Sebastian Vettel in fifth. Giancarlo Fisichella continued to struggle as he finished the session P17, around 1.6s behind teammate Kimi Räikkönen.\nThe second session was also red flagged this time with Red Bull's Mark Webber. A big accident on the pit straight as the nose, front left wheel and the wing took the impact as a lot of debris was put onto the track. However the other Red Bull of Vettel finished the session top 0.2s ahead of Alonso. Kovalainen took third, Heidfeld fourth and championship leader Button finished the days final session in fifth. Jenson's teammate Barrichello struggled to take eleventh almost one second slower than Vettel. Although Webber crashed out with one hour remaining in the session he managed to sixth.\nThe final practice session got under way with no cars posting a time for the best part of 15 minutes. With the first session of the weekend not being red-flagged it was Lewis Hamilton who finished top of the time sheets. Sebastian Vettel finished second trying to make the most of this Red Bull car as his teammate Mark Webber struggled for pace finishing down in thirteenth. The Williams of Nico Rosberg came third with Hamilton's teammate Heikki Kovalainen in fourth. Rubens Barrichello finished in sixth behind the two BMW's of Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld. Rubens's teammate and championship leader Jenson Button struggled and only managed fourteenth. The two Force India drivers didn't look quick at all as the high down-force circuit of Singapore didn't seem to suit the car. They ended the session P16 and 17. Giancarlo Fisichella seemed to be struggling a lot being 1.2s behind teammate Räikkönen and 2.4s behind Lewis Hamilton.\nQualifying.\nThe first qualifying session began with Renault's Romain Grosjean going down the escape round at turn 17 due to brake issues. Rosberg set the early pace but Button, Vettel, and Hamilton responded quickly with their own flying laps. Both Ferrari's were struggling until Räikkönen took second with three minutes remaining. His teammate Fisichella was eliminated alongside Sutil, Alguersuari, Romain Grosjean, and Liuzzi.. \nAt the beginning of the second qualifying session, Mark Webber was the pace-setter, but an amazing lap by Nico Rosberg secured his place in Q3. Button was struggling throughout the session, and, after narrowly avoiding putting the car into the wall on his final lap, he qualified a dismal twelfth. His teammate, Barrichello, made it through to Q3, but a post-qualifying gearbox change saw the Brazilian take a five-place grid penalty. Alongside Button, Nakajima, Kimi Räikkönen, Buemi, and Trulli were knocked out in this session.\nThe top 10 drivers set their early quick laps. Hamilton took the early lead with Vettel and Rosberg close behind. Barrichello spun off and hit the wall hard, destroying much of the left side of his car, which brought out the yellow flags. The red flag was brought out with 26 seconds remaining on the clock. The session was restarted, but the very low amount of time meant that no one was able to get back on track, and the session was effectively ended early. Hamilton took pole position ahead of Vettel, Rosberg, and Mark Webber. Although Barrichello qualified fifth, he started the race tenth after his gearbox change. This session was the third of four to be red flagged during the weekend; only the third practice session was not interrupted.\nRace.\nApproximately three hours before the scheduled race start it was announced Nick Heidfeld would be starting the race from the pitlane, after his team discovered insufficient ballast had been fitted to his car. This promoted all the cars behind him one position on the grid, significantly moving both the Brawn cars onto the 'clean' side of the starting grid, on the racing line.\nThe race began shortly after 8pm local time with Lewis Hamilton making a clean start from pole position. Nico Rosberg took advantage of being on the clean side of the track to overtake Sebastian Vettel into the first corner. Fernando Alonso attempted to also pass Vettel but was unsuccessful, giving Mark Webber the opportunity to overtake Alonso on the outside of Turn 7. Both Alonso and Webber went off track as Webber completed the move. Stewards deemed Webber's move illegal and on lap seven he was told to hand the position back to Alonso, which also meant letting Timo Glock through as the German had also passed Alonso on the first lap. Alonso's Renault teammate Romain Grosjean was not having any more luck, having to retire at the end of lap three with a recurring brake problem.\nWith Barrichello in seventh and Button out of the points scoring positions in 10th, Vettel looked to capitalise and try to close Button's 26 point lead in the Championship. By lap 13 he was 2.1 seconds behind Rosberg, who was in turn 2.5 seconds behind Hamilton. Vettel was the first of the leaders to stop, on lap 17. A lap later Rosberg pitted but he misjudged the level of grip on the pit exit, causing his car to cross the white line that distinguishes the pit lane from the race track, an offence that is punished by a drive-through penalty. Rosberg was issued with the penalty on lap 20 and would have to serve penalty within three racing laps. Hamilton also pitted on lap 20.\nThe following lap, an accident involving Adrian Sutil and Nick Heidfeld necessitated the deployment of the Safety Car to remove debris from the track. Sutil spun attempting to pass Jaime Alguersuari on the inside of Turn 14 and, with his car facing the wrong way, attempted to rejoin the circuit as Heidfeld was taking the corner, causing a collision that forced both cars to retire, Heidfeld's first non finish since the 2007 United States Grand Prix. Sutil was later reprimanded and fined $20,000 by stewards for dangerous driving. Most cars that had thus far not pitted for fuel and tyres did so under the Safety Car conditions, including both Brawn cars. The Safety Car did not benefit Rosberg, as Formula One regulations prevent a drive-through penalty being served under Safety Car conditions, meaning he would have to stop within two laps of the restart when the field was still closely bunched. During this round of pit stops, Alguersuari repeated the infamous mistake made by Felipe Massa at the 2008 race by attempting to exit his pit garage with the fuel hose still attached.\nThe race restarted on lap 26, with Vettel now pressurising Hamilton for the lead. Rosberg served his penalty on lap 28, demoting him to 14th position. Hamilton and Vettel traded fastest laps with the gap between them hovering under a second. Behind Vettel the longer-fuelled Timo Glock was being encouraged to keep pushing as his team believed they could leap-frog the Red Bull in the pits.\nVettel pitted for his second stop on lap 39 and was clearly pushing very hard, running over a kerb on his out lap and damaging the underside of his car, having already lost his right wing mirror. However, worse was to come, as on lap 40 the stewards handed him a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane. This left Hamilton 9.2 seconds ahead of Glock, who was in turn 7.6 seconds ahead of Alonso as Vettel served his penalty on lap 43. Red Bull's afternoon went from bad to worse three laps later as Webber spun out at Turn 1 after a right-front brake failure.\nMcLaren brought in both Hamilton and Heikki Kovalainen for their second stops, and Timo Glock also pitted. The Safety Car was not deemed necessary to clear Webber's car, giving Jenson Button, who had been following Kovalainen, the opportunity to put in a series of fast laps before his pit stop. With Barrichello running in seventh after a small problem at his second pit stop, Button had an opportunity to stay ahead of his teammate and extend his Championship lead. He pitted on lap 51, emerging in a net fifth position behind the impressively recovering Vettel and ahead of Barrichello.\nButton seemed to have the speed to catch Vettel, who was concerned about his brakes following the retirement of Webber as well as that of Alguersuari, of Red Bull's sister team Toro Rosso, also with brake problems. Button closed the gap to under two seconds before he too appeared to develop brake problems. Fortunately for Button, his attempts to catch Vettel had given him a ten-second cushion over Barrichello with two laps to go.\nNearly two hours after the race started, Hamilton completed the final lap to take the chequered flag, ahead of Glock and Alonso. Vettel and Button held on for fourth and fifth respectively, ahead of Barrichello, Kovalainen and Robert Kubica in the final points paying position. Button extended his Championship lead by one point to 15 ahead of Barrichello, with just three races remaining. Vettel was 25 points behind Button while Webber's crash meant he was now officially out of the running for the World Championship. Brawn would need 12 points from the remaining three races to clinch the Constructors' Championship, while Ferrari's poor race, with neither driver scoring points, allowed McLaren to close the gap to Ferrari to three points in the battle for third.\nUnder Bernie Ecclestone's proposed 'winner takes all' medals system, Button would have been declared World Champion after this result, with no other driver able to match his tally of six race wins. The Olympics-style system was planned to be used to decide the 2009 World Champion but was dropped after pressure from teams in favour of the traditional points method.\nClassification.\nQualifying.\n\"Cars that use the KERS system are marked with \"‡\"\"\nRace.\n\"Cars that ran KERS are marked with \"‡\"\"\nF1 Rocks Singapore With LG.\nThe inaugural F1 Rocks concerts was held in Singapore.

        "text": "Hugh \"Sawdust\" Hughes (1864 – ) was an international rugby union player who played club rugby for Cardiff and international rugby for Wales. Although very little personal information is available for Hughes, he is notable for facing the touring New Zealand Māoris, the first touring Southern Hemisphere rugby team, when they lost to Cardiff in 1888.\nRugby career.\nHughes was first selected for the Wales national rugby team in the away match against the Scottish team during the 1887 Home Nations Championship. The Wales team had experienced a fairly stable fullback position, filled by the likes of Charles Lewis, Arthur Gould and for the previous three matches, Llanelli's Harry Bowen. Hughes was brought in for the second game, which began a period of instability for the Wales fullback position. Wales suffered a terrible defeat, which saw the Scottish scoring fourteen tries. Hughes was dropped for the next match, with the selectors opting for Samuel Clark.\nAlthough overlooked for the 1888 Home Nations Championship, Hughes was part of the Cardiff team that on 29 December 1888, faced and beat the New Zealand Māori rugby union team. The Cardiff match was the last game of the Māori's tour of Wales which had been of mixed fortune for the tourists, though the team had beaten both Newport and Swansea over the last five days. Under the captaincy of Frank Hill, Cardiff were on top form, with a resurgent Norman Biggs scoring early on. Cardiff scored a second try later in the game, with a rare joint try from WT Morgan and Sydney Nicholls, which Hughes converted. Cardiff won by a goal to nil.\nHughes was reselected for Wales in the 1889 Championship, again for the away match to Scotland. Wales lost this game, but by a far smaller margin than the 1887 encounter. The next match of the tournament saw Hughes replaced by Ned Roberts.\nInternational matches played.\nWales (rugby union)"

However, Indiana had lost star player Scott May to a broken arm in the regular season finale against Purdue.

The game made USA Today's list of the greatest NCAA tournament games of all time.\nThe loss for Indiana prevented what could have been back-to-back undefeated seasons and national championships as the Hoosiers went on to take the national title in 1976. Bob Knight would later say that this 1974–1975 team was the best he ever coached, even better than the undefeated national champions of 1976. The win put UK in the Final Four in San Diego, where they dropped the NCAA title game in what would be John Wooden's last game."

        "title": "Tom Williams (rugby union, born 1859)",
        "text": "Thomas Williams (9 October 1859 – 4 February 1913) was a Welsh rugby union forward who played club rugby for Cardiff and Pontypridd and international rugby for Wales. A solicitor by profession, Williams would later become a national selector for the Welsh Rugby Union. Williams was also responsible for suggesting the singing of the Welsh national anthem in a match in 1905, the first time a national anthem was sung before a sporting event.\nWilliams was born in Llwynypia into a farming community in the Rhondda Valley and in his early years he lived in at the Tonypandy Inn. A solicitor by trade, he trained for his profession in Pontypridd, probably under Spicketts. Williams was the uncle of Wales international and British Lion Willie Llewellyn.\nRugby playing career.\nWilliams had a career in most levels of Welsh rugby union. He first came to note as a player, representing first class club Cardiff. In 1881, Williams was part of the Cardiff team which beat Llanelli in the South Wales Challenge Cup at Neath. The following year, Williams had switched to Pontypridd, and it was while with Pontypridd that he was selected for his one and only Welsh international cap. Wales had only played one international prior to 1882, a humiliating defeat to England at Blackheath. Williams was brought into a much changed pack to face Ireland, the first meeting between the two countries in a rugby union match. The Irish team were poor, and Wales earned their very first international victory, winning by two goals to nil. Although victorious, Williams was one of two players to be replaced for the next game, along with Hugh Vincent.\nAfter his international career, Williams returned to Cardiff Rugby Club. In 1884, while playing for Cardiff, Williams fell ill, and was replaced by Frank Hancock. On Williams recovery, the Cardiff club could not choose between Williams, their fastest threequarter, and Hancock, who had played to an impressive standard during his short run. Cardiff decided to play both, dropping a player from the pack to accommodate four threequarters, rather than the traditional three, changing the formation of their rugby team. This formation was trialed by Wales, with Hancock as captain in 1886, and adopted by the international side in 1888, before becoming a worldwide tactic that continues to this day.\nInternational matches played.\nWales\nRugby administrator.\nAfter his playing career had ended, Williams became heavily involved in the Welsh Rugby Union, the governing body of rugby in Wales. Williams had a background suited to the running and administration of sporting organisations, being one of the founders of Llwynypia RFC in 1891. Then at a lower level he became Secretary of the \"Rhondda, Ferndale and Aberdare league\", later to become the Glamorgan League. He took up a position as an administrator for the Mid-District area within the WRU, a role he would occupy from 1899 to 1910, before being made a life vice president. Williams was made a national selector in 1901, a role he held until 1908, and was seen as the most influential Welsh selectors of the day. \nWhen Wales hosted the first touring New Zealand team in 1905, Williams was at the centre of the selection of the Welsh team that would become the only team to beat the All Blacks during their tour. One of William's most notable ideas was not through his match selection, but his suggestion that the Welsh team respond to the New Zealand Haka by singing 'Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau', the Welsh national anthem. This idea was supported by the Welsh newspaper, the \"Western Mail\", which suggested that the Welsh supporters could join in the chorus. On the day, after observing the Haka, Teddy Morgan led the Welsh team in singing the national anthem, which was quickly picked up by the crowd. It was the first time a national anthem had been sung before a sporting event. Later in his career, Williams became one of the Welsh representatives for the International Rugby Board, the sports international governing body.\nRugby referee.\nAs well as being one of Wales' top sporting administrators, Williams was also a rugby union referee. He umpired a single international match, the 1904 encounter between England and Ireland in the Home Nations Championship, played at the Rectory Field in Blackheath. He also refereed at least three Barbarian matches during the invitational clubs tours of South Wales."

        "text": "Ryan Wilson (born February 3, 1987) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Colorado Avalanche.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nWilson first played Major junior hockey with the Toronto St. Michael's Majors of the Ontario Hockey League. Ryan led the defense in scoring in the last two of his three seasons with the Majors, before joining the Sarnia Sting for the 2006–07 season. Undrafted but establishing as a hard-hitting offensive defenseman, Wilson was invited as a free agent to the 2006 St. Louis Blues training camp before returning to the OHL. As captain of Sarnia, Ryan led the Sting's defense to be named to be named OHL defenseman of the Month for October. After participating in the 2007 OHL All-Star game for the Western Conference, Wilson finished the season with career high 17 goals and 75 points to lead the OHL in scoring among defenseman and place third in the Western Conference coaches poll with the Hardest shot, Best bodychecker and offensive defenseman categories.\nOverlooked in the NHL Entry Draft, Wilson was invited to the 2007 Philadelphia Flyers training camp on September 16, before returning for his final junior season as captain with the Sting in 2007–08. Alongside future first overall NHL draft pick, Steven Stamkos, Wilson led the Sting to the second round of the Western Conference finals finishing with a career high 64 assists and 71 points in 58 games as the leading scoring defenseman in the OHL for the second consecutive season. He was named as the Western conferences Best bodychecker, and earned selection to the OHL's Third All-Star Team.\nProfessional.\nCompleting his junior career, Ryan signed as a free-agent to a three-year entry level contract with the Calgary Flames on July 1, 2008. In the 2008–09 season, Wilson made his professional debut with the Flames affiliate, the Quad City Flames of the AHL. On March 4, 2009, he was traded by the Flames along with Lawrence Nycholat and a second round pick to the Colorado Avalanche for Jordan Leopold. He was then assigned to affiliate, the Lake Erie Monsters of the AHL, where he finished out the season.\nWilson started the 2009–10 season with the Monsters, before receiving his first recall to the injury stricken Avalanche on October 12, 2009. Ryan made his NHL debut with the Avalanche in a 3-2 victory against the Montreal Canadiens on October 14, 2009. He recorded his first point, an assist, against the Carolina Hurricanes on October 23, 2009. On November 17, 2009, Wilson scored his first career NHL goal in a 3-2 victory, fittingly against Miikka Kiprusoff of the Calgary Flames. Wilson remained with the Avalanche and quickly established himself as an aggressive open ice hitter, most notably gaining league-wide attention after delivering a big hit to New Jersey Devils star Patrik Eliáš. In the following game against the Edmonton Oilers on January 18, 2010, Wilson was on the receiving end of a targeted hit and was sidelined by a concussion. Ryan's rookie season slowed after sustaining a second concussion in the months following, however he finished the season to lead Colorado's defense in Plus/minus (+13) and place third in scoring with 21 points. On June 25, 2012 it was reported that Ryan re-signed with the Avalanche for $6.7 million over 3 years.\nOver the course of his contract extension with the Avalanche, Wilson's career was blighted by injury. He featured in just 12 and 28 games over the first two seasons before appearing in 3 games in his final year under contract in the 2014–15 season when the team announced that Wilson would be sidelined due to a season-ending shoulder surgery on November 18, 2014.\nAs a free agent, Wilson was unable to garner a solid contract offer. On September 3, 2015, it was announced that Wilson would join the Calgary Flames organization for their training camp for the 2015–16 season on a professional try-out contract. Wilson played in the pre-season with the Flames before he was released without a contract offer on October 5. Over a month later, Wilson headed overseas to sign for the remainder of the season with Russian club, Ak Bars Kazan of the Kontinental Hockey League, on November 6, 2015. Wilson made a tentative return with Ak Bars, appearing in 24 games for 3 assists in the regular season from the blueline. He registered two post-season goals in the playoffs before leaving as a free agent to end the year.\nUnsigned over the summer, Wilson belatedly signed a one-year deal with Swiss club, HC Lugano of the NLA on September 13, 2016."

        "title": "Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey team is the college ice hockey team that represents the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Earning varsity status in 1922, the program has competed in 102 seasons. Between 1959 and 1981, the team competed in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) before joining the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) until the 2012–13 season. Since the 2013–14 season, the Wolverines have competed in the Big Ten, which began sponsoring hockey.\nMichigan has had many successes as a program including a record-setting number of championships, total championship tournament appearances, and consecutive tournament appearances. From 1991 to 2012, the team played in 22 consecutive NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournaments, an NCAA record. The Wolverines have won nine Division I NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championships, seven of which came during a 17-year stretch between 1948 and 1964. Two more championships were won under head coach Red Berenson in 1996 and 1998. The Wolverines have won the second-most all-time NCAA National Hockey Championships with nine (1948, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1955, 1956, 1964, 1996, 1998), behind the Denver Pioneers record ten championships.\nPlayers from the program have earned numerous honors, professional championships, international championships, individual statistical championships, team and individual records. The most recent head coach was Mel Pearson, a former assistant to coach Red Berenson who retired in 2017 after leading the program for 33 years. Berenson for nearly 50 years has continued to hold the school single-season goal scoring record, and was the second player in the program's history to win the Stanley Cup. The program has dozens of National Hockey League alumni and over twenty current players. They currently hold the record for the most titles at the Great Lakes Invitational with 17 titles respectively. Their traditional rival is Michigan State and the teams have played an annual game in Detroit since 1990, first at Joe Louis Arena but currently at Little Caesars Arena since 2018.\nIn 2010, Michigan hosted a Guinness verified world record crowd in excess of 113,000 in an event known as The Big Chill.\nTeam history.\nEarly history.\nIn 1920, \"as a result of the interest in the interclass and interfraternity leagues, in which twenty-two teams took part\", an informal Michigan hockey team was organized to represent the university. Mr. Le Mieux of the Engineering faculty had played 12 years of professional hockey and offered his services as coach. Because of the difficulty in securing intercollegiate competition, the 1920 team played a six-game schedule against an Ann Arbor team, Assumption College, and four games against teams from the Detroit Hockey League. The 1920 Michigan team, with Russell Barkell as the team's high scorer, compiled a 6–0 record and outscored opponents 27 to 7. In February 1920, \"The Michigan Alumnus\" noted: \"There is a big sentiment for a Varsity hockey team. The difficulties are the lack of a University rink, and the arranging of suitable competition.\" In April 1920, \"The Michigan Chimes\" wrote:\"The record of our informal hockey team which was organized at the close of the January interclass sports, has been truly remarkable. With only two weeks of practice, it has defeated the three strongest Detroit teams. ... Unfortunately this one team of ours which seems able to win, and shows possibilities of great development has not as yet been recognized as a regular team.\"\nLater, \"The Michigan Chimes\" published a lengthy article pleading for the administration to recognize hockey as a varsity sport: \"Agitation was started for the recognition of hockey as a varsity sport. What spell, what charm there is in that single appellation bestowed by custom on football, baseball, track, and recently basketball! What obstacles must be overcome, what sacrifices made, to attain the heights!\"\nWith the success of the informal Michigan hockey team in 1920, Michigan moved forward with the development of the hockey team. According to Wilfred Byron Shaw's four-volume history of the University of Michigan, \"Hockey also had its beginning in 1921, with Joseph Barss as Coach (1921–26). Although officially not on the Western Conference athletic program, hockey provided a number of Big Ten teams with competition.\" The 1921 season saw the development of intercollegiate hockey at Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. In January 1921, Michigan and Wisconsin scheduled four games to be played on consecutive weekends from February 18 to 26, 1921. The 1921 team began the season with two games against the Michigan College of Mines at Houghton, Michigan. Michigan lost the first game 3–0 but won the second game 4–3. Russell Barkell, the first standout hockey player at Michigan, was the Michigan star in both games against the College of Mines. However, the remainder of the season, including the planned four-game series with Wisconsin, was cancelled due to warm weather. \"The Michigan Alumnus\" reported in March 1921: \"The warmth of the present winter has made necessary the cancelling of all scheduled hockey games. The informal team had started off well, but lack of ice made the development of a really powerful team impossible.\"\nIn December 1921, \"The Michigan Alumnus\" wrote: \"There will be much pushing of the puck this year. The Athletic Association hopes to have more money to spend for Michigan skaters, and plans to encourage hockey more than ever before. We used to spend our time 'doing the grapevine,' but only because we were not fast enough for shinny. More power to the shinny artists.\"\nOver the course of a 10-game schedule, Michigan's 1922 squad finished with a record of 5–5. The team opened the 1922 season with a 5–1 victory over Michigan Agricultural College (now known as Michigan State University) in the first hockey match between the rival schools. They followed with a 3–2 overtime victory over the Detroit Rayls on January 16, 1922. Later that month, the Notre Dame hockey team defeated Michigan 3–2 in overtime, marking the first defeat for the Michigan hockey team on its home rink in three years. The team traveled to Houghton for night games against the Michigan School of Mines, losing both games by scores of 2–1 and 5–2. The Wolverines beat the School of Mines 4–1 in a rematch in Ann Arbor. In the season's seventh game, Michigan defeated Wisconsin 6–3 in the first match between Western Conference hockey teams. Following another loss to Notre Dame (7–2), Michigan defeated Wisconsin for the second time by a score of 5–1; Barkell scored three goals against Wisconsin and was the high scorer in the game. The season ended with a 5–2 victory over the Windsor Monarchs.\nIn March 1922, \"The Michigan Alumnus\" reported that athletic director Fielding H. Yost had stated that recognition of hockey as a minor sport was very probable in 1923. Yost expressed the view that the sport should be either intramural or intercollegiate and not an informal sport. The same article noted that Michigan's hockey team had already met Notre Dame, Michigan School of Mines, Michigan Agricultural College and many Detroit teams.\nAccording to Bacon's history of the Michigan hockey program, the first \"official\" college hockey game played west of the Alleghenies was a game between Michigan and Wisconsin, played on January 12, 1923, in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The game went into overtime with Michigan prevailing by a score of 2–1. \"The Capital Times\" in Madison reported on the game as follows: \"Michigan counted the first point, when Kahn, by clever work, rushed the ball through the Badger defense for a goal. In the second period Blodgett for Wisconsin tied the score. The first five-minute period of overtime found both teams battling desperately. The second five minutes was a repetition. The Wolverines seemed held on from the side, slipped the puck through the goal for the winning point.\" In another account, the Madison newspaper wrote that, \"after outplaying Michigan all the way through, Wisconsin lost in the second overtime period when a lucky shot went for a goal.\" Michigan again defeated Wisconsin 1–0 in the second game of the season, played the following day, January 13, 1923.\nBarss coached the Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey team from 1922 to 1927. In five years as the head coach, the Michigan hockey team compiled a record of 26–21–4.\nAs the popularity of college hockey grew in the early 1920s, other colleges looked to Barss' pupils for coaching candidates. In January 1923, former Michigan hockey star Russell Barkell was hired as the coach of the hockey team at Williams College.\nIn February 1924, after a 3–0 victory by Michigan over Wisconsin, a Madison newspaper praised the defensive play of the Barss-coached Wolverines: \"With an almost air-tight defense and a definite scoring attack the Michigan hockey team defeated the Badger six by a score of 3–0 yesterday afternoon. Wisconsin could not stop Michigan's fast team work and was unable to penetrate their defense to take any close shots at the goal.\"\nIn mid-1925, the university purchased the former Weinberg Coliseum, a local ice skating rink that had served as the unofficial home of the Wolverines hockey team since 1920. The facility, which had previously relied on winter weather to maintain its ice, was renovated to add artificial coolant to guarantee its playing surface year-round. The Michigan Coliseum would remain home to the Wolverines until the opening of Yost Ice Arena in 1973.\nVic Heyliger era.\nFrom 1947–48 through 1956–57, when Vic Heyliger retired, the Michigan hockey team had won 195 games, lost only 41, and tied 11. The Wolverines' record got them 10 consecutive invitations to the Frozen Four, where they came home with the national title six times-records that have never been in danger of being broken by any college team a half century later. This also helped shift the locus of power in hockey from the East to the West when it was previously thought to be the other way around. Led by Michigan, the West won 18 of the first 20 NCAA championships, setting the question rather emphatically. The run also ensured the team its place on campus for years to come, filling a hole created by the football and basketball teams' mediocrity during the fifties.\nOf Michigan's 53 players who have earned All-American status, almost half (24) played for Heyliger between 1948 and 1957. During that stretch he never had fewer than two players on the All-American team. Four times he had five players so honored, and in 1956 he had a record six players on the squad. In Michigan history, twelve Wolverines have won it twice or more. Heyliger coached nine of them and recruited the tenth, Bob White. No other school has ever amassed and developed such a mother lode of talent in the history of college hockey.\nFor all of this Heyliger was given the NCAA's Spencer Penrose Award for Coach of the Year, he was inducted into the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame, and he was selected in 1996 by the American Hockey Coaches Association as one of the five best college coaches of the century, and the very best of the first half. In 1980 he became the first hockey coach to be inducted into the University of Michigan's Hall of Honor. Heyliger's severe asthma forced him to leave the team and Ann Arbor in the summer of 1957. His impact on the Michigan program, the NCAA tournament, the WCHA, and college hockey would be hard to overstate.\nAl Renfrew era.\nThrough Heyliger's tenure, athletic director Fritz Crisler had seen the virtue of having a Michigan man head the hockey program. When it came time for Crisler to conduct his second search for a hockey coach, therefore, he sought out Al Renfrew, an affable man who had captained the 1948–49 Wolverine squad and had already been coaching college hockey for six years.\nAt the end of Renfrew's first season in Grand Forks, Heyliger stepped down from the Michigan job and told Renfrew to put his name in for it. Renfrew wrote Fritz Crisler a letter in March indicating his interest, but Crisler didn't respond for over a month. Renfrew had already concluded he was out of the running when Crisler called to offer him the job. His decision should have been harder than it was. He had built a great team at North Dakota, and the players he recruited won the national title two years after he left, but he was too excited to be back in Ann Arbor.\nRenfrew inherited a team that had gone 18–5–2 and finished one victory short of its third consecutive NCAA title in 1956–57—and then Renfrew promptly suffered Michigan's first losing season since World War II. His skaters finished 8–13 in 1957–58, his first year, and 8–13–1 his second. But Renfrew wasn't worried-he knew he had a secret weapon coming in.\nFrom 1958 to 1964, some 14 players made the trek from Regina, Saskatchewan to Ann Arbor, including one Red Berenson. While still in high school, Berenson had already become a highly touted major junior player, one good enough to join the Montreal Canadiens system straight out of high school, but he had other ideas. A serious student, Berenson became aware of the world of American college hockey when Regina Pats high-profile coach Murray Armstrong went south of the border in 1956 to accept the head coaching job at University of Denver. Berenson visited North Dakota in 1958 and was favorably impressed at the caliber of players the former coach, a man named Al Renfrew, had lured to Grand Forks before Ranfrew returned to Michigan the year before. But soon after Berenson's visit to North Dakota, Dale MacDonald, a Saskatchewan native playing for Renfrew at Michigan, told his coach that Berenson was the rare player worth going out of his way to get. Renfrew scraped together enough money to fly the young phenom to Michigan, thereby making him the first hockey player ever to receive a free recruiting trip to Ann Arbor. The extra effort was worth it, for both parties. Once he was on campus, they didn't have to sell him on it. \"After I came down on a visit\", Berenson confirms, \"I came back and told the other guys. \"This is where we're going.\" And just like that, a pipeline of hockey talent was created between Regina and Ann Arbor.\nBerenson's decision, at least, came with a price. Frank Selke, the Montreal GM who had drafted Berenson, warned him that if he went to an America college he would never become a pro. Fully aware he might be sacrificing the dream of every Canadian boy to play in the NHL-and for the Montreal Canadiens, no less—Berenson didn't flinch. After sitting out his first year, which the NCAA required of all freshmen at that time, Berenson suited up for his first game on February 5, 1960, against Minnesota. He scored 90 seconds into his first game, assisted on another goal five minutes later and scored a third later in the game. Everyone in the building that night had just seen the future of Michigan hockey, and it looked bright.\nRenfrew notched his first winning season and his first league playoff berth in the 1960–61 season. The following season, the Berenson-captained squad didn't lose a game through New Year's, and finished the regular season with a 20–3 mark. As expected, the Wolverines received their first NCAA bid under Renfrew that spring. Michigan was a slight favorite entering the 1962 NCAA Tournament in Utica, New York, but were upset by Clarkson 5–4 in the semifinal. In a life with few regrets, the game against Clarkson ranks near the top for Berenson. \"We should've won it\", he said. \"We were destined to meet Michigan Tech in the finals, but got knocked off by and underdog-Clarkson-back when eastern teams weren't that good. You don't get too many chances to win it all as a player. At the time it doesn't seem so important, but 10 years, 20 years later, you ask yourself: \"Why the hell didn't we do that?\" After scoring his school record-tying 43rd goal against St. Lawrence in the consolation game, Berenson caught a ride to Boston, where he played for the Canadiens the next night, making him the first player to jump directly from college to the NHL.\nThe 1964 squad returned its two leading scorers from the previous season, Gary Butler and Gordon Wilkie, both ex-Pats, who had combined for 79 points in just 24 games the previous season. They played better than expected, combining for a remarkable 135 points in just 29 games-both players finished just shy of Berenson's single-season record of 70 points. Rookie Wilf Martin added an unexpected 58 points. Mel Wakabayashi, all 5'5\" of him, join the team in January 1964, centering Rob Coristine and Bob Ferguson on the third line. The trio added 107 points, which would have made them the top-scoring line the previous season. Added it all up and you had the first Michigan team to score more than 200 goals in a season, averaging a prolific 7.5 goals per game. Thanks largely to the scoring streak, this unheralded but determined bunch beat every opponent at least once en route to a 24–2–1 record, winning more games than any team in Michigan history. At the 1964 Frozen Four, Denver took care of Rensselaer, 4–1, while Michigan survived a close game with Providence, 3–2. For the final game, 7,000 Pioneer fans packed the Denver Arena to watch their team battle for its fourth NCAA title in seven years. The underdog Wolverines beat Denver, 6–3, in the Bulldogs' backyard, winning their seventh national championship. It was the last hurrah for the Regina regiment, a group of some 14 players who came to Ann Arbor between 1958 and 1964. \"This is the place\", Berenson told them, and they followed.\nTransition to Yost Arena and the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA).\nRenfrew retired as head coach following the 1972–73 season. He was succeeded by Dan Farrell, a former assistant coach at Michigan Tech (where Renfrew had previously coached). Farrell's first season was also the team's first at their new home in the converted Fielding H. Yost Field House, now known as Yost Ice Arena. Farrell guided the Wolverines to the 1977 NCAA championship game at Olympia Stadium, losing to the Wisconsin Badgers by a score of 6–5. Farrell's teams would be unable to duplicate that success, and he stepped down at the end of the 1979–80 season.\nWilf Martin returned to his alma mater to serve as head coach, but only lasted two games into the 1980–81 season before he was forced to step down for health reasons. Assistant coach John Giordano took over for the rest of the season. In 1981, Giordano's Wolverines moved from the WCHA to the CCHA, joining fellow Big Ten rival schools Michigan State (which also jumped from the WCHA) and Ohio State (a founding member of the CCHA), as well as football rival Notre Dame. It was hoped that the change in conferences would help the Wolverines compete, but Michigan followed up a first-round conference tournament loss to the Irish with back-to-back ninth-place finishes. In the spring of 1984 Giordano's team mutinied when all 22 players signed a list of grievances. With the entire team behind the revolt, athletic director Don Canham was left with little choice but to relieve Giordano of his duties.\nRed Berenson era.\nAfter a lengthy playing career in the NHL and a stint as head coach of the St. Louis Blues (where he won the Jack Adams Award) and a term as an assistant to Scotty Bowman in Buffalo, Red Berenson returned to his alma mater in 1984 to take over the reins. Berenson's teams faced a stiff rival in Ron Mason's Spartans, who dominated the CCHA in the mid-80s and won the 1986 NCAA championship. Prior to the 1989 CCHA playoffs, Berenson had the Wolverines adopt the winged helmet design associated with the football team.\nAfter several years of rebuilding the Wolverines finally won a CCHA playoff series in 1990 and returned to the NCAA tournament for the first time in 14 years the following season. That appearance was the first of a record 22 consecutive berths, including 11 Frozen Four appearances and three appearances in the title game, winning the championship in 1996 and 1998. Along the way Berenson's teams won 11 CCHA titles, 9 CCHA Tournaments and produced 11 30+ win seasons including a record 8 consecutive from 1991 through 1998. Two of Berenson's players won the Hobey Baker Award, Brendan Morrison (1997) and Kevin Porter while Marty Turco (127) and Steve Shields (111) became the 1st- and 2nd-winningest goaltenders in NCAA history.\nThe 1996 Frozen Four run is most notable for forward Mike Legg's goal in the regional semi-final against Minnesota at Munn Ice Arena in East Lansing. Legg picked up the puck behind the net with the toe of his stick, cradled it on the blade, and tucked it into the top corner all in one motion. The highlight-reel goal has become one of the most famous in the history of hockey worldwide and has been mimicked by many a player. While it goes by other names (Europeans call it an \"airhook\", while it has also been called a \"Svech\", after Carolina Hurricanes forward Andrei Svechnikov who was the first to score such a goal in the NHL), most hockey players and fans call this move a Michigan goal or \"The Michigan\".\nThe streak was broken in the final season of the CCHA, when the team failed to get an invite after losing the conference championship to Notre Dame. Berenson's final trip to the NCAA tournament came in 2016, which was also his last conference championship (this time in the Big Ten). Berenson announced his retirement on April 10, 2017.\nMel Pearson era.\nOn April 24, 2017, Mel Pearson was announced as the new head coach at the University of Michigan. In his first season the team went 22-15-3 overall, 11-10-3 in Big Ten play. They reached the 2018 Big Ten Men's Ice Hockey Tournament but lost to Ohio State (3-2) in overtime. Nevertheless, the team qualified for the NCAA Tournament and went to the Frozen Four before losing to Notre Dame (4-3) on a last-second goal.\nDuring the 2021 NHL Entry Draft, Michigan became the first school in NCAA Division I history to have three teammates drafted in the first round of the NHL Draft. Owen Power was drafted first overall by the Buffalo Sabres, Matty Beniers was drafted second overall by the Seattle Kraken, and Kent Johnson was drafted fifth overall by the Columbus Blue Jackets. Michigan also became the first program to have teammates drafted first and second overall in the same NHL Draft for the first time since 1969. With Beniers being picked by Seattle, Michigan became the first collegiate team to have a player drafted by all 32 NHL franchises. Incoming freshman recruits Luke Hughes was drafted fourth overall by the New Jersey Devils and Mackie Samoskevich was drafted 24th overall by the Florida Panthers. Michigan became the first program to have five players/recruits selected in the first round of one draft.\nOn August 5, 2022, it was announced Pearson was relieved of his duties.\nConferences.\nConference affiliation since 1951\nRecords by opponent.\nSource:\nCoaches.\nAll-time coaching records.\n\"^ Martin coached the first two games of the 1980–81 season before Giordano took over the coaching duties.\"\nStatistical leaders.\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nArena.\nBuilt in 1923 as a field house, the facility is named in honor of Michigan's legendary football coach and athletic director, Fielding H. Yost. For many years, it housed the Michigan basketball team, until they relocated to the larger Crisler Arena in 1967. It also housed the track teams in the 1950s. In 1973, it was converted into an ice arena, and the Michigan hockey team has used it ever since. The University of Michigan's Senior and Collegiate synchronized skating and freestyle teams also practice at Yost. In addition, local high school teams, recreational leagues (AAAHA) and the university's intramural hockey league call it home.\nThe arena is one of the most unusual in college hockey not only because it retains the charm of an old barn, but also offers the amenities of the most modern of arenas. It has served as home of Michigan hockey since 1973–74, and over 3 million fans have helped make it one of the most exciting and intimidating venues in college hockey. The atmosphere has helped the Wolverines on the ice significantly, accumulating more than 450 victories at home.\nYost Ice Arena has hosted NCAA Ice Hockey Tournament games five times in its history, most recently in 2003.\nThe Children of Yost.\nThe Children of Yost is the official student section for Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey.\nRivalries.\nMichigan State.\nMichigan and Michigan State first played each other in 1922.

        "title": "Congressional Baseball Game",
        "text": "The Congressional Baseball Game for Charity is an annual baseball game played each summer by members of the United States Congress. The game began as a casual event among colleagues in 1909 and eventually evolved into one of Washington, D.C.'s most anticipated annual pastimes, according to the House of Representatives Office of the Historian. In the game, Republicans and Democrats form separate teams and play against each other.\nToday, the game raises money for four charities: the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Washington, the Washington Nationals Dream Foundation, the Washington Literacy Center, and—following a pre-game practice shooting in 2017—the US Capitol Police Memorial Fund. The game is usually attended by crowds of congressional staffers, congressional families and, occasionally, even dignitaries and US presidents.\nHistory.\nThe 1909 game was organized by Representative John Tener of Pennsylvania, a former professional baseball player. The \"Boston Daily Globe\" observed, \"The game was brewing for weeks and the members of the house were keyed up a high pitch of enthusiasm. Deep, dark rumors were in circulation that 'ringers' would be introduced, but when they lined up at 4 o'clock the nine Republicans were stalwart, grand old party men, while the Democrats were of the pure Jeffersonian strain.\"\nThe Democrats beat their Republican opponents, 26–16 in the first game, and continued their winning streak for the first six games. Republicans won their first game in 1916. Due to its growing popularity, the Congressional Baseball Game was first covered via radio in 1928. The radio broadcast continued in succeeding years.\nThe event has, at times, interrupted the workflow of Congress. In 1914, Speaker James Beauchamp \"Champ\" Clark of Missouri became frustrated with the Congressional Baseball Game interfering with legislative business. Once, the House was to debate an appropriations bill on Civil War cotton damage, but a quorum was not present because of the game.\nDespite its appeal, the annual game occurred intermittently because of interruptions due to the Great Depression, the Second World War, and intervention by the House leadership. The game was held biennially until the Washington Evening Star newspaper sponsored it annually from 1946 to 1958. Despite the sponsorship, Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas ended the game in 1958, saying it had become too physically straining on the members and was causing injuries. With the new sponsor, the \"Roll Call\" Trophy was created, for the team that wins each best-of-five series. It was first awarded in 1965—to the Republican team, the first team to win three games since \"Roll Call\" had begun its sponsorship. Since 1965, a new trophy is awarded to the next team to win three games (over the next three, four, or five years), following the year in which the most recent trophy was awarded. As of the 2017 game, 14 trophies have been awarded—ten to the Republicans' team and four to the Democrats' team.\nOn June 14, 2017, one day before the annual event, a gunman opened fire on Republican members of Congress who were practicing for the next day's game. Four people were shot including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. The gunman was killed by Capitol Police. The FBI classified the shooting as an act of domestic terrorism. Despite discussions about postponing the game, it was held as scheduled. The shooting resulted in a dramatic increase in interest for the game; it was reported that revenue from ticket sales and online donations had exceeded $1 million, and organizers stated that 24,959 people were in attendance. C-SPAN announced that it would televise the game, and the 2021 game was televised by FS1 as well.\nLocations.\nThe game was initially played at American League Park II. However, after the park's destruction in a fire in March 1911, it was played at the Griffith Stadium built on the same site in Northwest Washington, D.C. In 1962, it was moved to the new District Stadium (later renamed Robert F. Kennedy Stadium). It remained there until 1972 when the Washington Senators moved to Texas, becoming the Texas Rangers as RFK did not need a long-term baseball seating layout or field. It moved for the next two decades to the Memorial Stadium in Baltimore, Maryland, then to Langley High School in McLean, Virginia for 1977; and Four Mile Run Park in Alexandria, Virginia. From 1995 to 2004, the game was played in Prince George's Stadium in Bowie, Maryland. From 2005 to 2007, the event returned to RFK Stadium when the Montreal Expos moved to Washington to become the Washington Nationals. In 2008, Nationals Park was completed, and the Nationals moved there along with the Congressional Baseball Game.\nIn the late 1960s, a post-game reception for members of Congress and their staff was organized and sponsored by Sears, Roebuck and Company. However, attendance was meager until 1972 when Sears' Washington office Public Information Officer Larry Horist took over the management of the event and established the Most Valuable Player awards to be voted by each team and presented by the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader of the Senate. He also obtained photos of the players in their hometown uniforms, producing baseball cards packaged in gum wrappers. A limited number of autographed master sheets of the cards occasionally appear for sale on Internet auction sites. The cards included such personalities as Senator Eugene McCarthy (D-MN), Barry Goldwater, Jr. (R-AZ), and professional player \"Vinegar Bend\" Mizell (R-NC). The cards were publicized in \"The Washington Post\" and became part of the permanent collection of the Baseball Hall of Fame.\nRosters.\nThe 2023 roster is available at the link in this citation, available from the game's official website.\nWhile the modern Congressional Baseball Game comprises both House and Senate Members, this was not always the case. From 1909 to 1949, House Members exclusively filled the rosters—although there appears to have been no prohibition against Senators. Bicameral baseball was inaugurated in 1950, when Senator Harry P. Cain of Washington joined the Republican team and Senator-elect George Smathers of Florida, a former Representative, joined the Democratic team.\nIn a few cases, former professional baseball players were elected to Congress and impacted the game. In the case of Wilmer \"Vinegar Bend\" Mizell of North Carolina, a former professional pitcher, the Republican team was victorious for each year that he played. Fielding a once-a-year team presented some problems for members, who often grew rusty when it came to batting. Strong pitching proved decisive in most games but, in 1963, neither team could field a pitcher. As a result, relief pitcher George Susce of the Washington Senators pitched for both teams.\nIn 1917, Representative Jeannette Rankin of Montana tossed out the first pitch and kept score, becoming the first woman to participate in the annual event. More than 70 years later, in 1993, Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, Maria Cantwell of Washington, and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas became the first women to break into the starting lineup.\nIn 1971, the first African Americans joined the game. Delegate Walter E. Fauntroy of the District of Columbia and Rep. Ron Dellums of California joined the Democratic roster. Despite Fauntroy's hitting prowess, the Democrats lost their eighth straight annual game, 7–3.\nIn 1909, Rep. Joseph F. O'Connell of Massachusetts hit the first home run, gaining three runs for the Democrats. In the same year, Republican Rep. Edward B. Vreeland of New York was the first player to be withdrawn due to an injury. In 1957, Rep. Gerald Ford of Michigan hit the first known grand slam, while playing for the Republicans. In 1979, Republican Rep. Ron Paul of Texas hit what is believed to be the first home run hit over the fence. Reps. John Shimkus of Illinois and Greg Steube of Florida are the only other players to hit out-of-the-park home runs, doing so in 1997 and 2021, respectively. Paul was inducted into the Congressional Baseball Hall of Fame before the 2012 game.\nHall of Fame.\nThe \"Roll Call\" Congressional Baseball Hall of Fame was founded in 1993 and a brief description of each of the inductees through 2011 is available via the sponsor's website.\nIn the early years of the game, each team wore a uniform that was either plain or had the words \"Republicans\" or \"Democrats\" embroidered on it. In modern games, members typically wear uniforms of the professional baseball teams or college baseball teams in their congressional district or home state. In the 1920s, pomp and fanfare preceded each game. The United States Navy Band and United States Marine Corps Band traditionally kicked off the festivities with patriotic tunes. In 1926, the Republicans paraded into American League Field on a live elephant, while in 1932, both teams had costumed mascots entertain the crowds. During the 1960s, the teams had cheerleaders dressed in uniforms.\nGame results.\nAs of the 2023 game, Republicans lead the series, 45–42–1. The official website of the Congressional Baseball Game for Charity seemingly does not count three of those Republican wins because its History page listed (in 2017, but before the 2017 game) the series record as 39–39–1 (in a blue, red, white, and black bar near the bottom of the page). However, the same page states—in reference to the Roll Call Trophy—that \"[t]o date, 10 of these coveted trophies have been awarded, eight to the Republicans and two to the Democrats.\" That statement indicates that the paragraphs of the History page were probably written after the 2002 game and before the 2005 game because the tenth trophy was awarded in 2002 and the eleventh trophy was awarded in 2005.\nThe Republicans won their 35th game in 2002 and then won seven more games after that (in 2003 to 2008, plus 2016). As of 2002, the Democrats had won 32 games; from 2003 to 2016, the Democrats won seven more games, for 39 wins (as of the 2016 game). Although the series record outlined in the bar near the bottom of the page includes the Democrats' seven wins between 2003 and 2016, the bar includes only four of the Republicans' seven wins during that same period. Scores, locations, and other details of past games are available here to the extent they are known."

        "text": "Michelle Edwards (born March 6, 1966) is an American retired professional women's basketball player. She was a member of the United States women's national basketball team, that claimed the bronze medal at the 1991 Pan American Games in Havana, Cuba. Edwards was inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in 2014.\nEdwards was born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts.\nAllocated to the Cleveland Rockers in the 1997 WNBA draft, the 5'9\" guard out of the University of Iowa played for Cleveland and the Seattle Storm during her career. She also coached at Rutgers University.\nEarly years.\nUnlike many notable basketball players, Edwards did not pick up the game at a young age. She was athletic, but her court of choice was a tennis court. She also skied, and dreamed of becoming the first black Olympic racer, although a case of frostbite cooled her interest in skiing. She spent a lot of time with her older brother Rodney, visiting a local park. He would go to the basketball court, but Edwards usually stopped to play with other girls where the swings were located. As she became a teenager, she started noticing boys, and would head over to the basketball court, not to play, but just to watch.\nAt first, she was too shy to join in, but eventually she did and soon was challenging some of the boys to one-on-one contests. She didn't always win, but she won more than she lost. Her skill soon earned her a nickname \"Ice\" because of her cool moves.\nEdwards played high school basketball for Cathedral High in Boston, where she would score over 2000 points in her high school career, the first girl in Massachusetts history to reach that level. Her career earned her a spot in the high school Hall of Fame\nWhile in high school she was noticed by Alfreda Harris, a Boston educator who had founded the Shelburne Center in Roxbury Massachusetts, place where Edwards played. Harris would later go on to become the first female head coach at the university of Massachusetts, Boston campus, and later would be inducted into their Hall of Fame. Harris noticed Edwards, and persuaded her to join a local AAU basketball team. College coaches learned about Edwards, and both Virginia and USC showed interest. Virginia sent a young assistant, Geno Auriemma to recruit her.\nCollege career.\nC. Vivian Stringer had cultivated a relationship with Harris while Stringer was at Cheyney State. This relationship continued, even after Stringer moved to take the head coaching position in Iowa. A women interviewing for an assistant coaching position told Stringer about a player she had seen in the Boston area. Stringer had no contact information, and started calling the high school, even though it was summer, trying to contact her. One day, she reached a janitor. She asked if he knew Edwards and he responded, \"Who, Ice? Are you kidding me? That girl is the 'truth'.\" He explained that her coach was Alfreda Harris, so Stringer called Harris. She wasn't sure that Harris would remember her, but she did, and responded, \"It's about time, Stringer. She's only the best damn player in America.\" Stringer began to recruit Edwards. On a recruiting visit, Edwards was embarrassed to admit she didn't know where Iowa was, so Stringer pulled out a map to show her. Stringer convinced her to enroll at Iowa. She was sympathetic, as she had not known where Iowa was, confusing it with Idaho, when Stringer had first been approached for the job.\nStringer had taken over a program at Iowa that had produced losing records for the prior three years. In Stringer's first season 1983–84, the record improved to 17–10. Edwards was one of the first recruits, and joined Stringer in her second year at Iowa. The team would go 20–8 in her freshman year, and improved that record each of the four years Edwards was at Iowa. The team finished second in the Big Ten in her freshman and sophomore years, then in a tie for first place as a junior, and sole possession of first place in her senior year.\nIn her freshman year, Iowa played Ohio State. The Ohio State team was unbeaten in conference play, while Iowa had just a single loss. The game was at Carver–Hawkeye Arena which had 15,500 seats, but over 20,000 showed up. They had to close the doors and turn away many fans, but the turnstiles recorded 22,157. a record number of fans to watch a women's basketball game at the time. Fans sat in the aisles, and the fire marshal sent a letter of reprimand to Christine Grant, who was then the director of women's athletics at Iowa. The letter still hangs prominently on Grant's wall. Ohio State won the game 56–47, but it is the attendance record that the two coaches remember. At Stringer's press conference, when she was announced as the new coach, she promised she would sell out the arena, which prompted audible snickers among the reporters. Edwards recalls missing a layup badly, because she was trying too hard. Coach Stringer consoled her, saying to her\"'Do you see that picture? That is how intense that game was and that is the level of play we need to operate on every time we hit the floor.\"\nIn Edward's senior year, Iowa agreed to play in the Burger King/Orange Bowl Classic, held in Miami, Florida on 28–30 December 1987. The opening game was against Auburn, ranked among the top ten teams in the nation. Iowa won the game 73–69, which set up a game the next day against Virginia, also ranked in the top ten. The Hawkeyes beat Virginia 75–59, which set up a game the following day against Texas. The Longhorns were ranked first in the country, had Clarissa Davis, who had won national Player of the Year honors the previous year, and would go on to win National Player of the Year and Wade Trophy honors in 1989. Texas also had Beverly Williams, a Kodak Al_American. Coach Stringer was very concerned about how to convince her team that they could defeat Texas. She spent the whole night working on a pre-game speech, which would include references to a woman who swam the English Channel with no arms, and Glenn Cunningham (athlete), who set records for the mile run after he had been told that a childhood burn incident would not let him walk again. She talked about faith and a woman who was able to lift a car to save a child. She closed by pointing to the black blackboard, and declared it was green. The entire team was caught up in her passion and agreed that it really was green. After the team prayer, the team headed to the court, and defeated the number one team in the country. The following week, Iowa was ranked number one in the country 75–65.\nEdwards was the leading scorer for her team in her sophomore, junior and senior years, scoring a total of 1821 points. She has the third highest scoring total among all Iowa players, and her 235 steals is also third best. She had 431 career assists, which is the second best in school history.\nIowa statistics.\nSource\nUSA Basketball.\nEdwards played with the USA team at the 1991 Pan American Games. The team finished with a record of 4–2, but managed to win the bronze medal. The USA team lost a three-point game to Brazil, then responded with wins over Argentina and Cuba, earning a spot in the medal round. The next game was a rematch against Cuba, and this time the team from Cuba won a five-point game. The USA beat Canada easily to win the bronze. Edwards averaged 4.7 points per game.\nProfessional career.\nTwo years after she graduated, the school honored her by retiring her jersey. Although she appreciated it at the time, the honor did not sink in until years later, when she reflected on all the players that have played at Iowa, and she realized she is the only one to have her jersey retired.\nAfter graduation, there were no major professional options for women in the United States. She wanted to play basketball, so decided to head to Italy to play for one of the club teams. Edwards had mixed feelings and cried on her trip over to Italy. However, she ended up play for nine seasons, earning All-Star Game MVP of the Italian League on three occasions. Over the nine years, she played for club teams Faenza, Pistoia, Ferrara and Pavia.\nWNBA.\nBeing selected by the Cleveland Rockers in the initial player allocation of the 1997 WNBA draft, Edwards debut game was played on June 21, 1997 in a 56 - 76 loss to the Houston Comets where she recorded 7 points, 2 rebounds, 2 assists and 3 steals. She would play for the Rockers for three years, averaging 8.1 points, 2.5 rebounds and 3.1 assists for the team.\nEdwards was traded to the Seattle Storm on June 11, 2000 for Nina Bjedov. Speaking on the trade, then Head Coach of the Rockers, Dan Hughes stated \"Michelle Edwards has meant a lot to this franchise both on the court and off. She has been with the team since the beginning. We owe her the opportunity to be somewhere where she will play\". The trade happened after only playing 3 games for the Rockers in the 2000 season. Edwards finished the 2000 season with the Storm, playing in 20 games while averaging 6.6 points, 2.0 assists and 1.7 rebounds.\nEdwards would only play 3 games in the 2001 season due to having a chronic left foot injury and would announce her retirement the next year on April 17, 2002. Because of this, her final WNBA game ever was the 3rd game she played with the Storm during her shortened 2001 season. That game was played on June 7, 2001 with the Storm falling 57 - 70 to the Miami Sol and Edwards only playing for less than 2 minutes (recording 1 rebound and no other stats).."

        "text": "Monster Mini Golf is a franchised chain of entertainment centers. The locations feature an indoor, 18-hole glow-in-the-dark mini golf course, video and redemption arcade games, three-dimensional animatronic props, an in-house radio station, party rooms for hosting birthday parties and other special events, as well as laser-tag, laser-maze, and bowling in some of the newer, larger facilities. The parent company, Monster Entertainment, LLC is headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island, United States, and Las Vegas. As of January 2023 the chain has 31 locations, either open or under construction, across the United States and Canada.\nHistory.\nFounders Christina and Patrick Vitagliano opened the first Monster Mini Golf in the small community of Danielson, Connecticut, on Memorial Day weekend in 2004. By 2005, they had made the decision to franchise, and were legal to offer franchises by November of that year. Monster Mini Golf has grown organically since inception, and as of January 2023, has grown to 31 locations in the US and Canada.\nBefore the inception of Monster Entertainment, Christina was the director of marketing for a multi-level entertainment complex in Providence, RI. Patrick was the founder of a sound/lighting/theatrical production company that provided sound and lighting for numerous Broadway theater productions and large concert tours. After marrying in 1997, Christina opened an antique auction house in Connecticut in 1998. Within four years it became one of the largest and most reputable auction houses in the area. In 2003 Christina decided to sell the business as the grueling hours and international travel become tiresome.\nThe concept for Monster Mini Golf was thought up on the way home from a weekend trip to New York City. Patrick sold his production company in 2004 and the couple combined their experience and talents to launch Monster Mini Golf. It took them five months to build the course and props before opening in an space in an old textile mill that had housed Christina's former auction house. Monster Mini Golf became legal to franchise in November 2005.\nLocations.\nAll locations incorporate glow-in-the-dark settings with fluorescent golf balls and monsters. The only consistent features in each franchise are the \"Enter at Your Own Risk\" sign that hangs above the cast-iron gated entrance to the \"cemetery,\" a hole featuring a mole hill with the cup inside the mole hill, a hole with a tricky path (hole in the middle of a hill followed by an animatronic organ player at the top of the hill), and the trademark clown statue that escorts customers out after the last hole (parody of the movie Happy Gilmore except this clown does not laugh and block the ball as it did in movie). Locations typically include two party rooms and an arcade with games such as glow-in-the-dark air hockey tables, custom-made glow-in-the-dark pool tables and arcade games as well as ticket redemption games such as glow Skee Ball.\nKISS by Monster Mini Golf.\nIn 2012, the company opened KISS by Monster Mini Golf in Las Vegas, Nevada, a facility themed around hard rock band KISS. Currently located in the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino, this location features the typical Monster Mini Golf fare (but heavily KISS-themed), a rock and roll themed wedding chapel called \"The Love It Loud Wedding Chapel\", the world's largest KISS gift shop, and a museum featuring memorabilia from the band's storied career on display. It also hosts regular appearances by KISS band members, both past and present.\nFranchise.\nMonster Mini Golf had been nominated by franchisees for Top New Franchise on Bizzia.com in 2007. Customers have also shown their interest, based on the company’s uniqueness and creativity behind the indoor mini golf concept. Monster Mini Golf sites average 9,000 to and are typically located in strip malls, stand-alone buildings or other commercial spaces. 100% of all franchises are currently owner operated. \nAs of 2017, there are currently 28 franchised locations in the US and Canada.\nMonster Cable vs. Monster Mini Golf.\nMonster Cable brought suit against Monster Mini Golf in 2006. Noel Lee, The CEO of Monster Cable, claimed that the public would be confused by the similarity of the names Monster Cable and Monster Mini Golf. After mediation and royalty suggestions that the owners deemed to be unfair; Monster Mini Golf launched a grassroots campaign against Monster Cable on the Internet, which managed to garner nationwide attention and support. After receiving hundreds of complaints from the public, Monster Cable dropped the lawsuit and agreed to pay up to $200,000 of Monster Mini Golf's legal fees."

The team played their home games at Breslin Center in East Lansing, Michigan. They were coached by Tom Izzo, in his fifth year as head coach, and were members of the Big Ten Conference. The Spartans finished the season 32–7, 13–3 to win a share of the Big Ten regular season championship for the third consecutive year. As the No. 2 seed in the Big Ten tournament, they defeated Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois to win the tournament championship for the second consecutive year. As a result, they received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. As the No. 1 seed in the Midwest region (their second consecutive No. 1 seed), they defeated Valparaiso and Utah to advance to the Sweet Sixteen for the third consecutive year. They then defeated Syracuse and Iowa State to advance to the Final Four for the second consecutive year. After a win in the National Semifinal over fellow Big Ten foe Wisconsin, MSU won the national championship over Florida. The win marked the school's second national championship and Izzo's only championship to date.\nPrevious season.\nThe Spartans finished the 1998–99 season 33–5, 15–1 to win their second consecutive Big Ten regular season championship.

MSU began the season ranked No. 3 in the country, but were without starting point guard and team captain, Cleaves, who sustained a stress fracture in his right foot during the offseason.\nWithout Cleaves, the Spartans began the season with a home win over Toledo before travelling to Puerto Rico for the Puerto Rico Shootout. In Puerto Rico, they defeated Providence and South Carolina to advance to the championship of the tournament. In the championship game, they lost to No. 20 Texas. The Spartans went on to defeat No. 2 North Carolina on the road as part of the inaugural ACC–Big Ten Challenge. MSU returned to East Lansing for easy wins over Howard and Eastern Michigan. A win over No. 5-ranked Kansas in the Great Eight in Chicago followed. A road loss to No. 2 Arizona followed the neutral court win over Kansas. MSU sandwiched home wins over Oakland and Mississippi Valley State around a loss on the road to unranked Kentucky. A shocking loss on the road at Wright State added to the early season struggles and ended the non-conference slate. MSU would enter the Big Ten schedule at 9–4 and ranked No. 11 in the country.\nBig Ten play.\nCleaves returned to the Spartans lineup on January 5, 2000 to help the Spartans to wins over Penn State and Iowa.

The loss stopped MSU's 21-game conference winning streak dating back to 1999. The Spartans bounced back with wins over Northwestern in back-to-back games, holding Northwestern to 29 points in the second game. A win over Illinois led by Charlie Bell's 20 points led to a matchup against rival Michigan with the Spartans at 15–5, 6–1 on the season. In Ann Arbor, MSU blew out the Wolverines as Michigan was without leading scorer Jamal Crawford who was declared ineligible 20 minutes before the game started because of NCAA investigations. Led by Morris Peterson's 32 points and 10 points, MSU had no problems with Michigan especially without their leading scorer, winning by 20. MSU then stepped out of conference for a matchup with No. 7 Connecticut, a fellow participant in the prior year's Final Four. The Spartans had no problems with the Huskies, scoring 25 second chance points and 20 points off Huskie turnovers. MSU returned to the Big Ten to face Purdue in West Lafayette and were upset, falling 70–67. The loss dropped the Spartans to 17–6, 7–2. The Spartans would rebound to beat Wisconsin in Madison before beating No. 7 Ohio State to avenge their earlier loss.

From there, the Spartans cruised to their third consecutive Sweet Sixteen with wins over Valparaiso, and Utah. MSU continued their national championship push by reaching their second consecutive Final Four with wins over Syracuse and Iowa State. MSU won every game by double digits despite playing the best possible seed in each round. In their Final Four matchup, Michigan State faced off against fellow Big Ten foe, Wisconsin, beating them in a hard-fought game, 53–41.\nIn the national championship game, the Spartans triumphed over the Florida 89–76, despite losing Cleaves to an ankle injury 3:42 into the second half. Cleaves eventually returned, severely limping and in obvious pain, to lead the Spartans to the championship. Cleaves was subsequently named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.

Russia won the championship, the third time they had done so; it was their 25th championship if it is included with those won by the Soviet Union team.\nBefore the start of the championship, each participating nation had to submit a list of players for its roster. A minimum of fifteen skaters and two goaltenders and a maximum of twenty skaters and three goaltenders had to be selected. A country that had selected fewer than the maximum allowed must have chosen the remaining players prior to the start of the tournament. After the start of the tournament, each team was allowed to select an additional two players to their roster, for a maximum of 25 players. Once players were registered to the team, they could not be removed from the roster.\nTo qualify for a national team under IIHF rules, a player must meet several criteria. He must be a citizen of the nation, and be under the jurisdiction of that national association. Players are allowed to switch which national team they play for, providing they fulfill the IIHF criteria. If participating for the first time in an IIHF event, the player would have had to play two consecutive years in the national competition of the new country without playing in another country. If the player has already played for a national team before, he may switch countries if he is a citizen of the new country, and has played for four consecutive years in the national competition of the new country. This switch may happen only once in the player's life.\nIlya Kovalchuk of Russia was named the tournament's most valuable player and top forward by the IIHF directorate. Canadian Shea Weber was named top defenceman and Andrei Mezin of Belarus was selected as top goaltender. Canada's Martin St. Louis and Chris Mason were the tournament's leading scorer and goaltender in save percentage respectively."

        "title": "Cricket in Afghanistan",
        "text": "Cricket in Afghanistan is the most popular sport in the country, which is represented internationally by the Afghanistan national cricket team. Afghanistan's border with the Test playing nation of Pakistan has helped the game to take root. Pakistan's former batsman Inzamam ul Haq has coached the Afghan national team in the past. Afghanistan became a full member of the International Cricket Council on 22 June 2017, enabling the national team to participate in official Test matches.\nAfghanistan's playing season runs from May to September. There are 320 cricket clubs and 6 turf wickets in Afghanistan. In February 2017 the International Cricket Council (ICC) awarded first-class status to Afghanistan's four-day domestic competition. They also granted List A status to their existing Twenty20 domestic competition, as Afghanistan did not have a domestic 50-over tournament. In May 2017 however, the ICC recognised the 50-over Ghazi Amanullah Khan Regional One Day Tournament by granting it List A status.\nHistory.\nCricket was first played in Afghanistan during the 19th century Anglo-Afghan Wars, with British troops reported to have played in Kabul in 1839. However, unlike many countries, no lasting cricket legacy was left by the British, and it would be more than a hundred years before cricket returned.\nIn the 1990s, cricket became popular amongst Afghan refugees in Pakistan, and the Afghanistan Cricket Federation was formed there in 1995. They continued to play cricket on their return to their home country in late 2001. Like all sports, cricket was originally banned by the Taliban, but it became an exception in 2000 and the Afghanistan Cricket Federation was elected as an affiliate member of the ICC the following year.\nThe Afghanistan national cricket team's 21-run win over Namibia in Krugersdorp earned them official One Day International status in April 2009. The team qualified for the 2012 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup.\nToday cricket is one of the most popular sports in Afghanistan, and the Afghanistan team has made quick progress in the international world of cricket.\nGoverning Body.\nAfghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) is the official governing body of the sport of cricket in Afghanistan. Its current headquarters is in Kabul, Afghanistan. The Afghanistan Cricket Board is Afghanistan's representative at the International Cricket Council and was an associate member of ICC from June 2013 to 2017. Now it is one of the full members of ICC since 2017. It is also a member of the Asian Cricket Council.\nDomestic Competitions.\nAfghanistan's domestic structure originally consisted of a 25-over Inter-Provincial Tournament, which had the participation of 22 provinces in the tournament. The aim of the tournament was to spread the game across the country and to generate a greater depth of talent for the national team to select from. The best players from the tournament were selected players for Afghanistan A and under-19 teams based on their performance and would be sent for training and coaching to Bangladesh.\nThe top two teams from the 12-team first round advanced to the next round. The top six from the tournament then contested a 50 over tournament in Kabul. The 50 over tournament in May 2010 was won by Kabul Province.\nStarting in 2011, Afghanistan's domestic cricket structure has grown. The expanded Inter-Provincial Tournament was reorganized into a 50 over tournament and divided into a Challenge Cup section (the Etisalat ODN Challenge Cup with 20 provincial teams) and an Elite Cup section (with 12 provincial teams; 4 of them qualifiers from the Challenge Cup section). In addition to the Inter-Provincial cricket the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) has divided the provinces of Afghanistan in to 5 Cricket Regions to enable the better management of the game. The Regions are Amo in the north (centered on Balkh), Spin Ghar in the east (centered on Nangarhar), Band-e-Amir in the centre (centered on Kabul), Mis Ainak in the southeast (centered on Khost) and Boost in the west and southwest (centered on Kandahar). The 5 regions in turn have representative teams which play in all traditional 3 formats of cricket.\nIn addition to an expansion of the inter-provincial tournament from 25-over matches to 50-over matches and the addition of the T-20 and multi-day formats, cricket in Afghanistan has now expanded across the provinces as well; 32 of the 34 provinces now have representative sides. All provinces except Daykundi and Farah have a representative team, while the ACB recognizes Afghan Refugees and Koochian (Nomads) as provincial teams. The three-day league competition was expanded into a four-day league in 2014-15.\nThe UAE-based telecommunications company, Etisalat is now one of the main sponsors of Afghanistan's cricket, including being then title sponsor in Afghanistan's division 2 inter-provincinal challenge cup and the Etisalat Sixes T20 Tournament.\nStarting from the 2017 season, Afghanistan has a four-day first-class competition (Ahmad Shah Abdali 4-day Tournament), a 50-over List A competition (Ghazi Amanullah Khan Regional One Day Tournament) and a recognized Twenty20 league (Shpageeza Cricket League). In 2019, an additional 3-day first-class event (Mirwais Nika Provincial 3-Day) and a List A event (Afghanistan Provincial Challenge Cup) were launched for individual provinces to compete in.\nIn March 2024, the ACB launched a new T20 cricket competition named Qosh Tepa National T20 Cup involving regional teams, with the first edition taking place in April 2024.\nStadiums.\nThe Afghan national cricket team does not play its home matches inside Afghanistan due to the ongoing security situation and the lack of international standard facilities. Afghanistan played their 'home' Intercontinental Cup fixture against Ireland at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium in Sri Lanka. Following Afghanistan's World Twenty20 qualifying campaign they played two One Day Internationals against Canada at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium in the UAE, after which the stadium was named the 'home' ground of Afghanistan.\nWork on the Sherzai Cricket Stadium in Jalalabad, a city known in Afghanistan for being the 'capital of cricket', is in progress. Construction has also begun on the Kabul National Cricket Stadium and the Kandahar International Cricket Stadium in the south of the country. The President of the Afghanistan Cricket Board, Omar Zakhilwal, announced in October 2010 that the government was planning to construct standard cricket grounds in all 34 provinces in the next two years.\nIn 2016, Shahid Vijay Singh Pathik Sports Complex in Greater Noida became the home ground for the Afghanistan national cricket team after they decided to shift their home ground from Sharjah.\nThe following are the main cricket stadiums in Afghanistan:\nThese grounds have hosted matches involving Afghanistan:\nNational team.\nThe Afghanistan national cricket team represents the country of Afghanistan in international cricket matches. The national team was formed in 2001, immediately after took part in Pakistan domestic circuit after being invited in 2001 . which played in the 2009 World Cup Qualifier after rising rapidly through the World Cricket League, starting in Division Five in May 2008. They play in the Elite division of the ACC Trophy.\nAfghanistan's 21-run win over Namibia in Krugersdorp earned them official One Day International status. Afghanistan won their first One Day International against Scotland.

        "text": "The 1975–76 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team represented Indiana University Bloomington and were the winners of the NCAA Men's Division I Tournament, the school's third national championship. The Hoosiers included three All-Americans and were led by head coach Bob Knight, in his fifth year, to an undefeated 32–0 record. The team played its home games in Assembly Hall in Bloomington, Indiana, and was a member of the Big Ten Conference. They remain, as of the 2023–24 season, the last team to be undefeated National Champions.\nRegular season.\nAfter coming up just short of winning a national championship the season before (1974–75), when they lost to Kentucky in the tournament, the 1975–76 team got off to a hot start. Starters Scott May, Quinn Buckner, Bobby Wilkerson and Kent Benson returned. Head coach Bobby Knight, then in his fifth year at Indiana, moved senior Tom Abernethy into Steve Green's starting role. Guard Bobby Wilkerson was an unsung hero who could do a little bit of everything. The team entered the season ranked No. 1.\nIn a preseason exhibition game against the reigning World Champion, the Soviet National team, the Hoosiers won by a convincing 94–78 margin. The Soviet team included two stars from their gold medal team in 1972, Aleksandr Belov and Sergei Belov. The game was played before a sellout crowd of 17,377 at the new (now-defunct) Market Square Arena in Indianapolis. Star Scott May scored 34 points on 13-for-15 shooting.\nThe Hoosiers then opened the season with an 84–64 win over the reigning NCAA National Champion, UCLA, which was coached by John Wooden's successor Gene Bartow. The game was played in St. Louis as one of the first made-for-TV games in college history, with the starting time at 11 p.m. for maximum national airing. May scored 33 points.\nThe Hoosiers returned to Market Square Arena to play Florida State. The Seminoles' head coach, Hugh Durham, said before the game: \"They beat Russia to prove they're the best in the world. And they beat UCLA to prove they're the best in the United States. Now I'd like to see them prove they're human and have a bad game.\" At halftime Indiana led 47–20 and they would go on to win 83–59. May scored 24 points and Kent Benson added 22. Afterward Durham said, \"I'm glad this isn't like baseball. I'd hate to play these guys in a three-game homestand.\"\nThe Hoosiers ended the regular season unbeaten, a feat that would be accomplished only seven times since, by Larry Bird-led 1979 Indiana State Sycamores, the 1979 Alcorn State Braves, the 1991 UNLV Runnin' Rebels, the 2004 St. Joseph's Hawks, the 2014 Wichita State Shockers, the 2015 Kentucky Wildcats, and the 2021 Gonzaga Bulldogs. All but Alcorn State and St. Joseph's would enter the NCAA Tournament unbeaten.\nIndiana is the last team to go unbeaten through the entire season, through preconference and conference seasons, and also finish unbeaten winning the NCAA Tournament. That mark has stood since 1976, though the number of games required to maintain an unbeaten season has increased in present times, making it more difficult to attain. The Hoosiers also had the distinction of having all five regular starting players earn their NBA pension.\nSchedule/Results.\n!colspan=8 style=| Regular Season\n!colspan=8 style=| NCAA Tournament\nNCAA tournament.\nEntering the NCAA Tournament the No. 1 ranked Hoosiers ended up with a difficult route for a No. 1 ranked team. The route included a regional matchup of No. 1 and No. 2 Marquette and convinced the NCAA Tournament Committee to begin seeding the tournament.\nIn the first game Indiana beat No. 18 St. John's 90–70. Scott May scored 33 points over a 23–6 team that had been unbeaten before Indiana beat them in December before a college-record Madison Square Garden crowd of 19,964.\nIn the next game Indiana beat No. 7 Alabama 74–69 behind the play of Scott May (25 points, 16 rebounds). Alabama led 69–68 when May hit a jump shot with 2:02 left. At the time, Coach Knight called this Alabama team the best any of his teams ever played.\nAgainst No. 2 Marquette, the Hoosiers won 65–56. Marquette coach, Al McGuire, attempted to contain May by using a box-and-one defense. May scored 15 points but sat out 13 minutes with foul problems. Marquette was 27–2 on the year and would go on to win the NCAA championship the following season.\nIn the next game the Hoosiers once again faced the UCLA Bruins, who entered the game ranked No. 5 with a 27–3 record. The Hoosiers won 65–51 behind 19 rebounds from 6′7″ guard Bobby Wilkerson and strong play from Tom Abernethy.\nIn the championship game, Indiana squared off against No. 9 Michigan for the third match up between the teams that season. After Indiana lost Wilkerson early to a concussion, Michigan led at half-time, 35–29. The Hoosiers ultimately prevailed 86–68. May had 26 points, Buckner 16, and Outstanding Player Award-winner Benson had 25.\nIndiana finished the season with a 32–0 record, and since 1976 no men's NCAA Division I team has gone unbeaten the whole season."

Some years later, a XV from London Welsh RFC toured Zagreb, which may be seen as a sign of how things were to improve.\nCroatian sides competed in the Rugby Championship of Yugoslavia, which ran from 1957-1991. Croatia was something of a centre of rugby union in Yugoslavia before it gained its independence.\nPost-independence.\nThe breakup of Yugoslavia meant that rugby was a low priority. However, it ironically had something of a minor revival in Croatia, when occupying British troops started to play regular games against the locals in the 1990s. By that point there were a thousand registered players in the country, and fourteen clubs, and some fifty Croats playing in the France's top three divisions.\nIn the early 1990s, former Italian cap, Dr Giancarlo Tizanini was a major driving force in Austrian rugby. Before his death in 1994, he tried hard to establish a Central European\nequivalent of the Six Nations between Austria, Hungary, Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia.\nThe biggest rugby \"scrum\" in the world was made on 14 Oct 2007, in Croatia, with over 200 players of all categories from Croatian rugby club Nada, for a Millennium Photo.\n, more than half of the 2,000 registered players are pre-teens or teenagers. In addition, there are currently 23 domestic clubs that compete against each other at various levels.\nWomen's rugby.\nCroatia's women played their first test match against Bulgaria on 2 December 2023 at Sinj.\nNational team.\nThe national team has been competing since the early 1990s. As of April 2009, the national team is currently competing in the European Nations Cup and is attempting to qualify for the 2011 Rugby World Cup.\nCroatia have a host of players who are New Zealanders, Australians and South Africans of Croatian origin who play the game and have played internationally for these countries.\nFrano Botica was a one time Croatian rugby coach and former All Black, whose grandparents were born in Korčula. Another former All Black who turned out for the Croatian side at the same time was Matthew Cooper. Dan Luger is an England representative whose father Darko Luger is from the island of Brac. Sean Fitzpatrick is another former All Black captain who has Croatian heritage. Also they have recently appointed a new coach named Milan Yelavich, he has a Croatian heritage but lives in New Zealand. He has coached the North Harbour Rugby team and has been associated with many other Rugby teams in New Zealand.\nDomestic competition.\nLocal Teams.\nThere are 22 men's teams and 1 women's team. Teams are located in the major cities.\nCurrently members of the Croatian Rugby Federation are the following teams (and cities in brackets)\nThe woman's club is called Viktorija Zagreb.\nInterliga Competition and Regional Rugby Championship.\nThe Interliga involved club teams from Croatia, Slovenia and previously Bosnia-Herzegovina.\nIn 2004/05, 9 teams participated (Croatia: RK Nada Split, RK Zagreb, HARK Mladost, Makarska Rivijera and RK Sisak - Slovenia: RK Ljubljana, Bežigrad and Emona - Bosnia: RK Čelik) with Ljubljana finishing first.\nIn 2005/06, 5 teams entered with Croatia's Zagreb winning the competition.\nIn 2006/07, 6 teams entered and Nada became competition winners for the first time.\nAlso in season 2007/08 onward, a Regional Rugby Championship was set up with teams from Croatia, Hungary, Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia and others."

        "title": "Swimming (sport)",
        "text": "Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of one's entire body to move through water. The sport takes place in pools or open water (e.g., in a sea or lake). Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports, with varied distance events in butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley. In addition to these individual events, four swimmers can take part in either a freestyle or medley relay. A medley relay consists of four swimmers who will each swim a different stroke, ordered as backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle.\nSwimming each stroke requires a set of specific techniques; in competition, there are distinct regulations concerning the acceptable form for each individual stroke. There are also regulations on what types of swimsuits, caps, jewelry and injury tape that are allowed at competitions. Although it is possible for competitive swimmers to incur several injuries from the sport, such as tendinitis in the shoulders or knees, there are also multiple health benefits associated with the sport.\nHistory.\nEvidence of recreational swimming in prehistoric times has been found, with the earliest evidence dating to Stone Age paintings from around 10,000 years ago. Written references date from 2000 BC, with some of the earliest references to swimming including the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Bible, Beowulf, the Quran and others. In 1538, Nikolaus Wynmann, a Swiss–German professor of languages, wrote the earliest known complete book about swimming, \"Colymbetes, sive de arte natandi dialogus et festivus et iucundus lectu\" (\"The Swimmer, or A Dialogue on the Art of Swimming and Joyful and Pleasant to Read\").\nSwimming emerged as a competitive recreational activity in the 1830s in England. In 1828, the first indoor swimming pool, St George's Baths was opened to the public. By 1837, the National Swimming Society was holding regular swimming competitions in six artificial swimming pools, built around London. The recreational activity grew in popularity and by 1880, when the first national governing body, the Amateur Swimming Association was formed, there were already over 300 regional clubs in operation across the country.\nIn 1844 two Native American participants at a swimming competition in London introduced the front crawl to a European audience. Sir John Arthur Trudgen picked up the hand-over stroke from some South American natives and successfully debuted the new stroke in 1873, winning a local competition in England. His stroke is still regarded as the most powerful to use today.\nCaptain Matthew Webb was the first man to swim the English Channel (between England and France), in 1875. Using the breaststroke technique, he swam the channel in 21 hours and 45 minutes. His feat was not replicated or surpassed for the next 36 years, until T.W. Burgess made the crossing in 1911.\nOther European countries also established swimming federations; Germany in 1882, France in 1890 and Hungary in 1896. The first European amateur swimming competitions were in 1889 in Vienna. The world's first women's swimming championship was held in Scotland in 1892.\nMen's swimming became part of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens. In 1902, the Australian Richmond Cavill introduced freestyle to the Western world. In 1908, the world swimming association, Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA), was formed. Women's swimming was introduced into the Olympics in 1912; the first international swim meet for women outside the Olympics was the 1922 Women's Olympiad. Butterfly was developed in the 1930s and was at first a variant of breaststroke, until it was accepted as a separate style in 1952. FINA renamed itself World Aquatics in December 2022.\nCompetitive swimming.\nCompetitive swimming became popular in the 19th century. The goal of high level competitive swimming is to break personal or world records while beating competitors in any given event. Swimming in competition should create the least resistance in order to obtain maximum speed. However, some professional swimmers who do not hold a national or world ranking are considered the best in regard to their technical skills. Typically, an athlete goes through a cycle of training in which the body is overloaded with work in the beginning and middle segments of the cycle, and then the workload is decreased in the final stage as the swimmer approaches competition.\nThe practice of reducing exercise in the days just before an important competition is called tapering. Tapering is used to give the swimmer's body some rest without stopping exercise completely. A final stage is often referred to as \"shave and taper\": the swimmer shaves off all exposed hair for the sake of reducing drag and having a sleeker and more hydrodynamic feel in the water. Additionally, the \"shave and taper\" method refers to the removal of the top layer of \"dead skin\", which exposes the newer and richer skin underneath. This also helps to \"shave\" off mere milliseconds on your time.\nSwimming is an event at the Summer Olympic Games, where male and female athletes compete in 16 of the recognized events each. Olympic events are held in a 50-meter pool, called a long course pool.\nThere are forty officially recognized individual swimming events in the pool; however the International Olympic Committee only recognizes 32 of them. The international governing body for competitive swimming is World Aquatics, previously named the \"Fédération Internationale de Natation\" (\"International Swimming Federation\"), or more commonly, FINA, prior to 2023.\nOpen water.\nIn open water swimming, where the events are swum in a body of open water (lake or sea), there are also 5 km, 10 km and 25 km events for men and women. However, only the 10 km event is included in the Olympic schedule, again for both men and women. Open-water competitions are typically separate to other swimming competitions with the exception of the World Championships and the Olympics.\nSwim styles.\nIn competitive swimming, four major styles have been established. These have been relatively stable over the last 30–40 years with minor improvements. They are:\nIn competition, only one of these styles may be used except in the case of the individual medley, or IM, which consists of all four. In this latter event, swimmers swim equal distances of butterfly, then backstroke, breaststroke, and finally, freestyle. In Olympic competition, this event is swum in two distances – 200 and 400 meters. Some short course competitions also include the 100-yard or 100-meter IM – particularly, for younger or newer swimmers (typically under 14 years) involved in club swimming, or masters swimming (over 18).\nDolphin kick.\nSince the 1990s, the most drastic change in swimming has been the addition of the underwater dolphin kick. This is used to maximize the speed at the start and after the turns in all styles. The first successful use of it was by David Berkoff. At the 1988 Olympics, he swam most of the 100 m backstroke race underwater and broke the world record in the distance during the preliminaries. Another swimmer to use the technique was Denis Pankratov at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, where he completed almost half of the 100 m butterfly underwater to win the gold medal. In the past decade, American competitive swimmers have shown the most use of the underwater dolphin kick to gain advantage, most notably Olympic and World medal winners Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte; however currently swimmers are not allowed to go any further than fifteen metres underwater due to rule changes by FINA. In addition, FINA announced in 2014 that a single dolphin kick can be added to the breaststroke pullout prior to the first breaststroke kick.\nWhile the dolphin kick is mostly seen in middle-distance freestyle events and in all distances of backstroke and butterfly, it is not usually used to the same effect in freestyle sprinting. That changed with the addition of the so-called \"technical\" suits around the European Short Course Championships in Rijeka, Croatia in December 2008. There, Amaury Leveaux set new world records of 44.94 seconds in the 100 m freestyle, 20.48 seconds in the 50 m freestyle and 22.18 in the 50 m butterfly. Unlike the rest of the competitors in these events, he spent at least half of each race submerged using the dolphin kick.\nCompetition pools.\n World Championship pools must be (long course) long and wide, with ten lanes labelled zero to nine (or one to ten in some pools; zero and nine (or one and ten) are usually left empty in semi-finals and finals); the lanes must be at least wide. They will be equipped with starting blocks at both ends of the pool and most will have Automatic Officiating Equipment, including touch pads to record times and sensors to ensure the legality of relay takeovers. The pool must have a minimum depth of two metres.\nOther pools which host events under World Aquatics regulations are required to meet some but not all of these requirements. Many of these pools have eight, or even six, instead of ten lanes and some will be long, making them Short course. World records that are set in short course pools are kept separate from those set in long course pools because it may be an advantage or disadvantage to swimmers to have more or less turns in a race.\nSeasons.\nCompetitive swimming, from the club through to international level, tends to have an autumn and winter season competing in short course (25 metres or yards) pools and a spring and summer season competing in long course (50-metre) pools and in open water.\nIn international competition and in club swimming in Europe, the short course (25m) season lasts from September to December, and the long course (50m) season from January to August with open water in the summer months. These regulations are slowly being brought to competition in North America.\nAs of right now, in club, school, and college swimming in the United States and Canada, the short course (25 yards) season is much longer, from September to March. The long-course season takes place in 50-meter pools and lasts from April to the end of August with open water in the summer months.\nIn club swimming in Australasia, the short course (25m) season lasts from April to September, and the long course (50m) season from October to March with open water in the summer months.\nOutside the United States, meters is the standard in both short and long course swimming, with the same distances swum in all events. In the American short course season, the 500-yard, 1000 yard, and 1650-yard freestyle events are swum as a yard is much shorter than a meter (100 yards equals 91.44 meters), while during the American long course season the 400 meter, 800 meter, and 1500-meter freestyle events are swum instead.\nBeginning each swimming season racing in short course allows for shorter distance races for novice swimmers. For example, in the short course season if a swimmer wanted to compete in a stroke they had just learned, a 25-yard/meter race is available to them, opposed to the long course season when they would need to be able to swim at least 50 meters of that new stroke in order to compete.\nOfficials.\nThere are several types of officials, which are needed to manage the competition.\nReferee: The referee has full control and authority over all officials. The referee will enforce all rules and decisions of World Aquatics and shall have the final answer to all questions relating to the actual conduct of anything regarding the meet, as well as the final settlement of which is not otherwise covered by the rules. The referee takes overall responsibility for running the meet and makes the final decisions as to who wins each race. Referees call swimmers to the blocks with short blasts of their whistles. This is the signal for the swimmers to stand next to their blocks. Then the referee will blow a long whistle that will tell the swimmers to step on the block. For backstroke events, the long whistle is the signal for the swimmers to jump into the water. The referee will then blow another long whistle, signalling the swimmers to grab the gutter or the provided block handle. Finally the referee will hand over the rest to the starter by directing their hand to the starter.\nStarter: The starter has full control of the swimmers from the time the referee turns the swimmers over to them until the race commences. A starter begins the race by saying, \"Take your mark.\" At this point, the swimmers will get into stationary positions, sometimes known as \"point zero\", in which they would like to start their race. After all swimmers have assumed their stationary position, the starter will push a button on the starting system, signaling the start of a race with a loud noise (usually a beep or a horn) and flash from a strobe light. A starter sends the swimmers off the blocks and may call a false start if a swimmer leaves the block before the starter sends them. A starter may also choose to recall the race after the start for any reason or request the swimmers to \"stand\", \"relax\" or \"step down\" if they believe that (a) particular swimmer(s) has obtained an unfair advantage at the start.\nClerk of course: The clerk of course (also called the \"bullpen\") assembles swimmers prior to each event, and is responsible for organizing (\"seeding\") swimmers into heats based on their times. Heats are generally seeded from slowest to fastest, where swimmers with no previous time for an event are assumed to be the slowest. The clerk of the course is also responsible for recording and reporting swimmers who have chosen to \"scratch\" (not swim) their events after they have signed up or qualified to a semifinal or final. The clerk is also responsible for enforcing rules of the swim meet if a swimmer chooses to not show up (\"No show\" - NS, or \"Did Not Swim\" - DNS) to their events. \nTimekeepers: Each timekeeper takes the time of the swimmers in the lane assigned to them. Unless a video backup system is used, it may be necessary to use the full complement of timekeepers even when automatic officiating equipment is used. A chief timekeeper assigns the seating positions for all timekeepers and the lanes for which they are responsible. In most competitions there will be one or more timekeepers per lane. In international competitions where full automatic timing and video placing equipment is in use timekeepers may not be required.\nInspectors of turns: One inspector of turns is assigned to one or more lanes at each end of the pool. Each inspector of turns ensures that swimmers comply with the relevant rules for turning, as well as the relevant rules for start and finish of the race. Inspectors of turns shall report any violation on disqualification reports detailing the event, lane number, and the infringement delivered to the chief inspector of turns who will immediately convey the report to the referee.\nJudges of Stroke: Judges of stroke are located on each side of the pool. They follow the swimmers during their swim back and forth across the pool. They ensure that the rules related to the style of swimming designated for the event are being observed, and observe the turns and the finishes to assist the inspectors of turns.\nFinish judges:\nFinish judges determine the order of finish and make sure the swimmers finish in accordance with the rules (two hands simultaneously for breaststroke and butterfly, on the back for backstroke, etc.)\nIf an official observes a swimmer breaking a rule concerning the stroke they are swimming, the official will report what they have seen to the referee. The referee can disqualify (or DQ) any swimmer for any violation of the rules that they personally observe or for any violation reported to them by other authorized officials. All disqualifications are subject to the decision and discretion of the referee.\nThose who are disqualified may choose to protest their disqualification however, in age group level swimming, this is rare. Protests are reviewed by a panel of officials instead of the deck referee or stroke judges who may have made the initial disqualification report.\nSwimwear and equipment.\nCommon swimwear.\nBrands such as Arena, Speedo, TYR, and Adidas are popular regular swimwear brands. The most durable material for regular swimming is Polyester. The main difference between competition and regular swimwear is that competition swimwear is tighter and compresses the muscles of the swimmers. Regular swimwear is easier to put on and more comfortable for leisure activities.\nMen.\nThe most used practice swimwear for men includes briefs and jammers. Males generally swim barechested.\nThere was controversy after the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008 when many Olympic swimmers broke records an unprecedented number of times using revolutionary swimsuits that covered their entire legs. To highlight the issue, in 2008, 70 world records were broken in one year, and 66 Olympic records were broken in one Olympic Games (there were races in Beijing where the first five finishers were swimming faster than the old world record).\nAs of 1 January 2010, men are only allowed to wear suits from the waist to the knees. They are also only permitted to wear one piece of swimwear; they cannot wear briefs underneath jammers. This rule was enacted after the controversy in the Beijing Olympics and Rome World Championships.\nWomen.\nWomen wear one-piece suits with thicker and higher backs for competition, though two-piece suits can also be worn during practice. Backs vary mainly in strap thickness and geometric design. Most common styles include: racerback, axel back, corset, diamondback, and butterfly-back/Fly-Back. There are also different style lengths: three-quarter length (reaches the knees), regular length (shoulders to hips), and bikini style (two-piece). As of 1 January 2010, in competition, women must wear suits that do not go past the shoulders or knees.\nUse of drag wear.\nDrag suits are used to increase water resistance against the swimmer to help them train for competitions. Other forms of drag wear include nylons, old suits, and T-shirts: articles that increase friction in the water to build strength during training, and thus increase speed once drag items are removed for competition. Some swimmers practice in basketball shorts over their bathing suit, wearing two bathing suits, or wearing an extra bathing suit with holes cut in the material.\nMany swimmers also shave areas of exposed skin before end-of-season competitions to reduce friction in the water. The practice gained popularity after the 1956 Olympics, when Murray Rose and Jon Henricks came shaved and won gold medals for Australia. Freshly shaven skin is less resistant when in the water. In addition, a 1989 study demonstrated that shaving improves a swimmer's overall performance by reducing drag.\nThe disadvantages of using a drag suit include the depletion of proper stroke. This is caused by the swimmer's own fatigue. When the swimmer becomes more fatigued, different muscle groups become more tired. Consequently, the swimmer will try to engage another group of muscle to do the same thing, which can cause the stroke efficiency to drop.\nElite and international swimming.\nElite and international swimming comprises the highest level of competition available to swimmers, including competitions such as the Olympic Games and the World Aquatics Championships.\nProfessionalism.\nSwimming creates a mix of levels, including: fully professional, semi-professional, and amateur. Fully professional swimmers will typically get a salary both from their national governing body and from outside sponsors, semi-professionals a small stipend from their national governing body, and amateurs receive no funding. Outside of these major championships prize money is low – the 2015 FINA World Cup series has a total prize fund of $3,000 per race shared between the top three and the 2014–15 USA Grand Prix Series $1,800 compared to the 2015 World Aquatics Championships fund of $60,000 per race shared between the top eight.\nOpen-water swimming.\nOpen water swimming is swimming outside a regular pool, usually in a lake, or sometimes ocean. Popularity of the sport has grown in recent years, particularly since the 10 km open water event was added as an Olympic event in 2005, contested for the first time in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.\nNew recent technology has developed much faster swimsuits. Full body suits have been banned, but swimmers at the very top levels still wear suits that have been lasered together because stitching creates drag. The disadvantage of these suits is that they are often uncomfortable and tight, and can tear easily if not handled carefully.\nThe largest Ocean Swim's in terms of numbers of participants are in Australia, with the Pier to Pub, Cole Classic and Melbourne Swim Classic all with roughly 5000 swimming participants.\nChanges to the sport.\nSwimming times have dropped over the years due to superior training techniques and new technical developments.\nThe first four Olympics were not held in pools, but in open water (1896 – the Mediterranean, 1900 – the Seine river, 1904 – an artificial lake, 1906 – the Mediterranean). The 1904 Olympics' freestyle race was the only one ever measured at 100 yards, instead of the usual 100 meters. A 100-meter pool was built for the 1908 Olympics and sat in the center of the main stadium's track and field oval. The 1912 Olympics, held in the Stockholm harbor, marked the beginning of electronic timing.\nMale swimmers wore full-body suits until the 1940s, which caused more drag in the water than their modern swimwear counterparts experience. Competition suits now include engineered fabric and designs to reduce swimmers' drag in the water and prevent athlete fatigue. In addition, over the years, pool designs have lessened the drag. Some design considerations allow for the reduction of swimming resistance, making the pool faster. These include proper pool depth, elimination of currents, increased lane width, energy absorbing racing lane lines and gutters, and the use of other innovative hydraulic, acoustic, and illumination designs. There have been major changes in starting blocks over the past years. Starting blocks used to be small, narrow and straight but through time they have become bigger and wider and nowadays the surface of the block is angled towards the swimming pool. In addition, starting blocks now have a \"wedge\" which is a raised, slanting platform situated at the rear of the main block. This enables the swimmer to adopt a crouched position at a 90 degrees angle and push off quicker with the rear leg to increase their launch power.\nThe 1924 Summer Olympics were the first to use the standard 50-meter pool with marked lanes. In the freestyle, swimmers originally dove from the pool walls, but diving blocks were incorporated at the 1936 Summer Olympics. The tumble turn was developed by the 1950s and goggles were first used in the 1976 Olympics.\nThere were also changes in the late 20th century in terms of technique. Breaststrokers are now allowed to dip their heads completely under water to glide, which allows for a longer stroke and faster time. However, the breaststrokers must bring their heads up at the completion of each cycle. In addition, a key hole pull in the breaststroke start and turns has been added to help speed up the stroke. Now off the start and turns, breaststrokers are allowed one butterfly kick to help increase their speed. This change was made official in December 2014. Backstrokers are now allowed to turn on their stomachs before the wall in order to perform a \"flip-turn\". Previously, they had to reach and flip backwards and a variation of it, known as a \"bucket turn\" or a \"suicide turn\", is sometimes used in individual medley events to transition from backstroke to breaststroke.\nRecords.\nThe foundation of FINA in 1908 signaled the commencement of recording the first official world records in swimming. At that time records could be established in any swimming pool of length not less than 25 yards, and records were also accepted for intermediate distance split times from long-distance events. Today World Records will only be accepted when times are reported by Automatic Officiating Equipment, or Semi-Automatic Officiating Equipment in the case of Automatic Officiating Equipment system malfunction.\nRecords in events such as 300 yd, 300 m, 1000 yd, and 1000 m freestyle, 400 m backstroke, and 400 m and 500 m breaststroke were no longer ratified from 1948. A further removal of the 500 yd and 500 m freestyle, 150 m backstroke, and 3×100 m medley relay from the record listings occurred in 1952.\nIn 1952, the national federations of the United States and Japan proposed at the FINA Congress the separation of records achieved in long-course and short-course pools; however, it was four more years before action came into effect with the Congress deciding to retain only records held in 50 m pools as the official world record listings.\nBy 1969 there were thirty-one events in which FINA recognised official world records – 16 for men, 15 for women – closely resembling the event schedule that was in use at the Olympic Games.\nThe increase in accuracy and reliability of electronic timing equipment led to the introduction of hundredths of a second to the time records from 21 August 1972.\nRecords in short course (25 m) pools began to be officially approved as \"short course world records\" from 3 March 1991. Prior to this date, times in short course (25 m) pools were not officially recognised, but were regarded a \"world best time\" (WBT). From 31 October 1994 times in 50 m backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly were added to the official record listings.\nFINA currently recognises world records in the following events for both men and women.\nHistorical breakthroughs.\n— denotes instances that cannot be determined\nHealth benefits.\nSwimming is a healthy activity that can be done by most people throughout their life. It is a low-impact workout that has several mental and bodily health benefits all while being a good recreational activity. Swimming builds endurance, muscle strength, and cardiovascular fitness. Correspondingly, it also improves weight loss while being a safer alternative of working out for someone who is injured or for women who are pregnant. Swimming generally requires less effort than many other sports while still providing similar physical benefits.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reports that two and a half hours per week of aerobic physical activity such as swimming can decrease the risk of chronic illnesses, and help regenerate healthy cells. Furthermore, swimming is linked to better cognitive function; also lowering the risk of Type II diabetes, high blood pressure, and a stroke. It can improve lung and heart strength while it tones muscles in a full body workout. People can typically exercise longer in water than on land without increased effort and minimal joint or muscle pain. When in the water the body undergoes less physical stress thus releasing pressure from the joints.\nIn addition to the physical benefits of swimming, lower stress levels and occurrences of depression and anxiety are known to decrease while swimming. Swimming is a meditation sport meaning there is an increase of blood flow to the brain which allows an individual to evaluate stressors more calmly. For those with dementia swimming has a number of positive benefits such as reducing anxiety and agitation, provides opportunities to socialize and contributes to a positive sense of self-worth.\nCommon injuries.\nThe rotator cuff in the shoulder is most susceptible to injury in swimmers. Injury to the rotator cuff results from repeated trauma and overuse. The joints are more prone to injury when the arm is repetitively used in a position above the horizontal line of the body. This position occurs in each of the four swimming strokes in every cycle of the arms. Out of the four tendons in the rotator cuff, the supraspinatus is most prone to tearing. Rotator cuff impingement is due to pressure on the rotator cuff from part of the scapula as the arm is raised. \nThe best way to prevent injury is catching the issue early. Typically, poor technique and over excessive use of the muscle group can be the primary causes of injury. Through communication between swimmers, coaches, parents, and medical professionals, any issue can be diagnosed prior to a serious injury. Additionally, proper warm-up, stretches, and strength training exercises should be completed before any rigorous movements.\nIn treating a rotator cuff injury, the most important factor is time. Due to the nature of the joint being primarily stabilized by muscle and tendon, the injury must be fully healed to prevent recurrence. Returning to swimming or other demanding exercises too soon can result in degeneration of a tendon which might result in a rupture. During the rehabilitation period, focus should be placed on rotator cuff and scapular strengthening.\nAnother common injury is breaststroke knee, also known as swimmer's knee. This injury is caused by the kicking movement used while swimming breaststroke. The kicking movement will cause wear and tear on the knee and it will eventually lead to constant pain. In recent studies it has been found that initially, the pain is only experienced when the kick was executed, but eventually the pain spread to other regular day-to-day activities, athletic and non-athletic."

        "title": "Chris Mack (basketball)",
        "text": "Christopher Lee Mack (born December 30, 1969) is an American college basketball coach who is currently the head coach at the College of Charleston. He formerly served as head coach for the University of Louisville and Xavier University.\nBackground.\nChris Mack was born in Cleveland, Ohio and grew up in North College Hill, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati. He graduated in 1988 from St. Xavier High School in Cincinnati, where he was named 1987–88 \"Cincinnati Post\" Metro Player of the Year.\nMack continued on to the University of Evansville, where he played basketball for two seasons. He then transferred to Xavier University in 1990, where he played his final two seasons of eligibility (after redshirting one due to then-current NCAA transfer rules), and graduated in 1992 with a B.A. in Communication Arts.\nHe is married to the former Christi Hester, a Louisville native and former University of Dayton guard (1996–2000). They have three children and resided in Northern Kentucky before he took the Louisville position.\nCoaching career.\nHigh school.\nMack started his coaching career as junior varsity head coach at McAuley High School, an all-girls high school in Cincinnati, in 1993. In 1995, Mack was named head coach of the girls varsity basketball team at Mount Notre Dame High School in Reading, Ohio, where he received the 1996 Coach of the Year award from the \"Cincinnati Post\".\nCollege.\nXavier and Wake Forest.\nIn 1999, he was named Director of Basketball Operations at Xavier University, serving under the late Skip Prosser, whom he followed as an assistant coach to Wake Forest in 2001.\nReturn to Xavier.\nIn 2004 Mack returned to Xavier, joining new head coach Sean Miller as his top assistant.\nHead coach at Xavier.\nWhen Miller moved to the University of Arizona in 2009, on April 15, 2009, it was announced that Mack would replace Miller as Xavier head coach. The first top 25 ranking by a Mack-led Xavier team was March 1, 2010 when it made its season debut in the Associated Press Poll at #25. During that season, the Jordan Crawford-led Musketeers won the Atlantic 10 Conference and advanced to the NCAA Sweet 16. The Musketeers had question marks heading into the next season, yet Mack guided the team to its fifth consecutive Atlantic 10 Championship before falling to Marquette in the first round of the NCAA tournament. During both of these years Mack earned Atlantic 10 Coach of the Year awards. Heading into the 2011–2012 campaign the Musketeers were slated to be one of the top teams in the country. With senior All-American Tu Holloway returning, Mack and Xavier were on the cusp of a special year. Xavier got off to a good start and were ranked as high as #7 before a bench-clearing brawl with their in-city rival Cincinnati Bearcats derailed the Musketeers. Mack's squad did not win the Atlantic 10 Tournament title in 2012 but was able to advance to the NCAA Sweet 16 with wins over Notre Dame and Lehigh. Since Xavier joined the reconfigured Big East for the 2013–14 season, it has continued to build upon the success attained in the A-10 making the Sweet Sixteen for a third time in six years during the 2014–15 season while attaining regular Top 25 rankings. Mack won several national coach of the year awards following the 2015–16 season in which Xavier finished 28–6, including the Hank Iba Award. The Musketeers had the highest preseason ranking in school history of 7th (Associated Press) under Mack prior to the 2016–17. After overcoming multiple injuries to key players Xavier went on a tremendous run defeating 6th seeded Maryland, 3rd seeded Florida State and 2nd seeded Arizona landing in the Elite Eight for the third time in school history. On January 18, 2018, Mack passed former Xavier head coach Pete Gillen and became the all-time leader in Xavier coaching wins after defeating St. Johns 88–82. Mack eventually would lead his 2018 Xavier squad to the school's first No. 1 seed, becoming the 1-seed in the NCAA Tournament's West Region. The team would eventually bow out of the tournament in the second round to Florida State, losing 75–70 to the West Region's 9-seed. Xavier finished the 2018 season with a 29–6 record.\nUniversity of Louisville.\nOn March 27, 2018, Mack agreed to terms on a seven-year contract worth about $4 million annually to become the next head coach at the University of Louisville. In December 2019 Mack's Louisville basketball team was ranked #1 in the country for two weeks before stumbling and losing 3 out of 5 games. In January 2020 the team recovered to beat #3 ranked Duke in a statement win.\nMack was suspended from the first six games of the 2021–22 season. The university claimed that Mack violated the school's guidelines while dealing with former assistant coach Dino Gaudio's extortion attempts. Unbeknownst to Gaudio, Mack recorded the conversation in which he fired the assistant coach and was threatened by Gaudio for doing so. On January 26, 2022, it was announced that Mack was out as head coach of the University of Louisville. Louisville paid Mack $4.8 million — $133,000 per month for three years with his termination.\nCollege of Charleston.\nAfter a two-year coaching hiatus, Mack signed a five-year contract worth roughly $1.1 million annually to lead the College of Charleston men's basketball team, after former Mack-assistant and Charleston head coach Pat Kelsey left to coach at the University of Louisville."

The livelier ball resulted in a marked increase in home runs league-wide, including Tokyo Yakult Swallows outfielder Wladimir Balentien breaking the cherished NPB single-season home run record of 55, previously held by professional baseball's all-time home run leader Sadaharu Oh."

Clark was the first Neath player to win an international cap for Wales while representing the club; and played in the second Welsh international match in 1882.\nRugby career.\nClark was born in Dorset in 1857, but moved to Wales while in his childhood. By 1874, at the age of 17 he began playing for Neath Rugby Football Club, and on 27 April 1880 he was appointed as the secretary of the South Wales Football Association. The SWFU was a body, although only formed in 1878, which was attempting to organise rugby events within South Wales and was Welsh rugby's first union. When Richard Mullock organised a Welsh XV to play England in 1881, it was Clark who notified the press that \"...the team which represented Wales was not elected by the committee of the South Wales Football Union; neither had they anything to do with it.\" Although this served in distancing the SWFU from the humiliating loss suffered by the Welsh team, it turned Mullock into the lone voice of Welsh international rugby.\nOn 12 March 1881, eleven representatives of rugby clubs and colleges from around Wales met at the Castle Hotel in Neath and formed the Welsh Football Union, which would eventually be renamed the Welsh Rugby Union. The biggest omission from the meeting was Neath RFC. Not only was the meeting held in Neath, the club was the oldest in Wales and both Clark as secretary and J.T.D. Llewellyn as president of the SWFU were both Neath men. The SWFU had decided not to attend the meeting, which would form a union, which in turn would replace itself. After the March meeting the WRU took up the functions of the SWFU which never met again.\nAlthough slighted at being replaced from his duties, Clark was soon on good terms with the WRU, and on 28 January 1882 he was chosen to represent Wales in their second international game. The game was played away from home at Lansdowne Road, and was the first ever meeting between the Welsh and Irish rugby teams. Clark was paired at full-back with Charles Lewis, and although an acrimonious match, Wales won by two goals to nil. Clark would need to wait over five years for his second and final international cap, again played against Ireland. The match was the final game of the 1887 Home Nations Championship, with Clark brought in to replace Cardiff's Hugh 'Sawdust' Hughes. The Welsh full-back position was in a phase of transition, and Clark was one of five different players would take up the role in the eight games leading up to Billy Bancroft taking the position long-term. Although Wales were victorious over Ireland, Clark was himself replaced for the next season by Ned Roberts.\nAfter his playing career, Clark became secretary for Neath RFC.\nInternational games played.\nWales"

The final was held on 23 August 2003.\nSummary.\nAlmost 10 years before this race, Wang Junxia had set the world record out to a remarkable 29:31.78 at the 1993 National Games of China. For the next 9 years, second place in that race in Beijing, Zhong Huandi had also been the second best 10,000m ever run by a woman 30:13.37 (more than half a lap behind Wang). One year before this race, Paula Radcliffe finally improved on second place, her 30:01.09 got within 30 seconds of the world record, showing women the record was not impossible. Radcliffe was not in this race, having set the world record in the Marathon 4 months earlier as well as the 10K road world record two months before that. Missing those two, this race only became the greatest women's 10,000m in history.\nAnikó Kálovics started off fast, running a 2:59.62 first 1K. Then Sun Yingjie took the point, her awkward running form taking the crowd through 4K in 12:00.16. Kenyan ex-pat Lornah Kiplagat running for The Netherlands then took over the lead, 15:06.53 to the halfway point and the next kilometer just barely over 3 minutes to take the 5 leaders to 6K in 18:07.25. During the next kilo, the defending champion and two time Olympic champion Derartu Tulu dropped out. Only Sun, Kiplagat and two Ethiopians; Werknesh Kidane and Berhane Adere remained all taking their turn trying to take the lead, the group reaching 9K in 27:14.06. On the penultimate lap, Sun dropped a 68 to put herself in front. On the final backstretch, Adere moved onto Sun's shoulder to pounce for the lead. Sun accelerated with the challenge, but Adere went by in a different gear, running away to the gold medal. Kiplagat couldn't stay with the others battling for the lead, but Kidane didn't let Sun get away, the two sprinting down the home and dipping at the finish line. The photo finish revealed that Kidane had beaten Sun by .05 of a second after 10,000 metres.\nWhen the dust had settled, Adere had the #3 best time in history, Kidane #4, Sun #5 and Kiplagat #6. Even Alla Zhilyaeva, who was not really in contention in a distant 5th place, had run the #12 time in history. In 7th place Xing Huina set the world junior record 30:31.55."

        "title": "1880–81 Home Nations rugby union matches",
        "text": " \nThe 1880–81 Home Nations rugby union matches were a series of international rugby union friendlies held between the England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales national rugby union teams. This season is most notable for the introduction of Wales as an international rugby union nation, playing their first ever match in a game against England. Although Wales were humiliated by a crushing defeat it did not stop rugby union being adopted by Wales as the country's national sport.\nThe only recognised competition held between the countries was the annual Calcutta Cup match, contested between England and Scotland. It was the third challenge for the Cup.\nResults.\nScoring system.\nThe matches for this season were decided on goals scored. A goal was awarded for a successful conversion after a try, for a dropped goal or for a goal from mark. If a game was drawn, any unconverted tries were tallied to give a winner. If there was still no clear winner, the match was declared a draw.\nThe matches.\nEngland vs. Ireland.\nEngland continued their experiment, which it began in 1880, of holding international matches in the North of England, after disappointing crowds in the South. England brought in five new caps, four into the pack, but it was their experienced backs of Hornby and Stokes that continued to cause their opponents the most problems. The game itself was one sided, with Henry Taylor scoring England's very first hat-trick of tries.\nIreland vs. Scotland.\nWith the Irish Rugby Football Union founded in 1879, and centres founded in Leinster, Munster and Ulster, a united Irish rugby-playing community celebrated their first international win with victory over Scotland. The Ireland dropped goal came from John Bagot, in his last appearance for his country. Despite the loss, Scotland showed the way forward by introducing a three-man three-quarter line for the first time at an international level; and also brought in Charles Reid, a teenager from Edinburgh Academy. Reid was the first schoolboy to play in a forward position in an international match.\nEngland vs. Wales.\nAfter the inability of the South Wales Football Union to successfully organise matches with teams from other countries, Richard Mullock, secretary of Newport Athletics Club, managed to arrange an international with the Rugby Football Union, between a Wales XV and England. With a date set, Mullock now needed an international team. The group of players brought together to form the very first Wales team were selected for their geographic spread, to appease as many regions of the country as possible; and their academic pedigree. Without first playing a trial game together, the team had little cohesion with players not only meeting for the first time, but with many also playing out of their normal position. Even with these problems, the result was still shocking, with the England team scoring 7 goals, 6 tries and a dropped goal to nil, 82-0 by modern scoring. One of the Welsh players was later reported as saying that the team was \"...lucky to get nil.\"\nThe fallout from the match, saw hostile editorials and letters in the Welsh press. The SWFU distanced themselves from the match, stating that the Welsh team was a private enterprise conducted by Mullock; but when Mullock pushed forward to set up a Welsh union later that year the clubs went with him, preferring his positive style over the SWFU's inaction. The 12 March 1881 saw the creation of the Welsh Rugby Union, with Mullock installed as secretary.\nScotland vs. England.\nThe third contest for the Calcutta Cup ended in a draw with a goal and a try scored by both sides. Edinburgh Academy had the distinction of supplying a player on both sides during the game, with Charles Reid representing Scotland, and Frank Wright being drafted into the England squad when the team turned up a player short, when one of their players missed the train. The match was also notable for being the last international game for Lennard Stokes, who retired from rugby to concentrate on his medical career."

In the 1881 census he was described as a rope agent and was living in the centre of Cardiff with his wife Marion. Although playing for several south-eastern Welsh clubs, he is most notable as a Newport player.\nDuring the 1885/1886 season, Bridie had found work in Bradford, and left behind his connections with Welsh rugby. Still wishing to continue playing rugby he joined local club Manningham FC. After just playing one game for Manningham he turned out for bitter rivals Bradford, before switching back to Manningham FC. The Manningham supporters, created a chant based on the derogatory nursery rhyme, Taffy was a Welshman; despite the fact that Bridie was deemed not to be Welsh by the Scottish rugby fraternity."

        "title": "Australian handball",
        "text": "Australian handball is a sport in which players hit a ball against one or more walls.\nPlay.\nAustralian handball is similar to squash played without a racquet. The ball is served such that it makes direct contact with the front wall without having bounced on the ground. It must then be returned similarly by the opponent to the front wall before the ball bounces on the ground twice. It may also contact side walls to or from the front wall, but once a player has struck the ball with hand, it must make contact with the front before touching the ground.\nThe game is played in singles or doubles format. There are 1, 3 or 4 wall versions of this game. The typical Australian version is the three wall version, as most courts in Australia are set for this version. Perhaps the bulk of these playing venues are set in various private Catholic Colleges.\nHistory and development.\nAustralian handball is similar to Gaelic, Welsh and American handball, and has been played formally in Australia, since 1923.\nIntroduction.\nAlthough its formal beginnings in Australia date from 1923, it has been played in some capacity or another since the 19th century.\nA similar game was introduced from Ireland and the first Australian Handball court was built by Melbourne hotel-keeper, Michael Lynch, in 1847.\nSchoolboys.\nIts early development has been attributed to the work of Christian Brothers' Colleges.\nHandball was very strongly promoted among the students at Christian Brothers' Colleges, driven by the Brothers' view that handball \"affords an excellent preparatory training for football, as it calls into play all the resources of the physical man\", and is one of the best ways for a potential Australian Rules footballer to acquire the optimum level of hand–eye coordination, ambidexterity, smoothness and flexibility, and sense of where one is in time and space (e.g., Bill Serong who played in three Grand Finals for Collingwood, went to the Christian Brothers' College in Victoria Parade, and was the Australian handball champion in 1974, aged 38).\nNational competition.\nOver most of its history, its primary play has been in Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales. As the game continued to develop, by 1970, there were about 1,000 players registered within the New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian state associations.\nFor many decades, the Australian Handball Council has held almost annual national championships, and each state has held its own state titles. Senior titles have not been the only level of keen interest and activity, however. During the 1950s' and 1960s, both – the Australian Singles Schoolboys Handball Championships and the Australian Doubles Schoolboys Handball Championships – were held on regular bases. Many great champions of the past were 'blooded' on these schoolboy rivalries. Additionally, over many decades Australians have made regular appearances at the World Junior and World Senior Titles. Within Australia, of more recent decades, the chief rivalries have been between Victoria and South Australia. For the past three decades, the states have generally engaged in some 'midpoint' venue – usually in Warrnambool, Victoria, over one weekend annually, for the national handball championships. In some areas, modern changes to school venues have meant the disappearance of the school's traditional handball courts, making it harder on handballers to access the game.\nThe game is nationally run by the Australian Handball Council, formed in 1928, of which the current executive director is Jim Kiley, and the Secretary/Treasurer – Greg Hay.\nNotable players.\nA few highly respected names in the game's history include multi-national champions, James Martin \"Jim\" Flattery, Tim Tucker, and George Macris in the first half of the 20th century, and John Hughes of Victoria, Paul Fallon of NSW , Lou Ravesi of SA, and Vic DeLuzio and Geoff Walsh of Victoria, in the 2nd half."

        "text": "The 2003 Afro-Asian Games, officially known as the First Afro-Asian Games or I Afro-Asian Games and unofficially known as the Inaugural Afro-Asian Games, was a major international multi-sport event held in Hyderabad, India, from 24 October (excluding football and hockey, which began on 22 October and 23 October respectively) to 1 November 2003.\nThe Afro-Asian Games was the largest sporting event ever to be held in Hyderabad, and one of the largest in India, second only to the 2010 Commonwealth Games by athletes' volume. The scale of these Games exceeds even the two Asian Games held in Delhi in 1951 (both by athletes' volume and by number of participating nations) and 1982 (by number of participating nations). More than 2000 athletes from 96 countries competed in the Games. A total of 131 sporting events in eight disciplines were conducted. Also, 120 countries sent 1,565 official representatives to these Games.\nThe first Afro-Asian Games were held after nearly two decades of delays, shifts and cancellations. The prolonged amount of time for these Games considerably reduced interest in them. After the preliminary decision of hosting the Games, the venue was shuttled between New Delhi and Kuwait City. At the last moment, New Delhi was out favoured by Hyderabad, which had hosted the National Games of India in 2002.\nThese Games, however, had lesser scope than the Asian Games or Commonwealth Games, since 96 nations participated in only eight disciplines. The Games witnessed only one new world record. Thirty-seven countries – an unprecedented 39% of the participating nations – won at least one medal in these Games.\nHistory.\nThe idea to hold an inter-continental sporting event between Asia and Africa was initiated in April 1983, with New Delhi as the proposed venue. However, for unknown circumstances, the venue was shifted to Kuwait and the Games were proposed to be held in 1985. Political instability led to the cancellation of the Games. In 1989, the proposal was reconsidered, with New Delhi again chosen as the venue for the Games. The Games were then scheduled for 1991. The plans went wrong due to inefficient communication between the members, and so could not come into force.\nIn 1999, a proposal for the renewal of the Games was accepted. Subsequently, Pune and then New Delhi were proposed as venues. However, they were postponed till November 2001. Slow preparations led to indefinite postponement again. After the occurrence of 9/11, Delhi pulled out. This led to the circulation of rumours that the games were \"jinxed\". Later, the IOA announced that the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) and the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa (ANOCA) had sanctioned 2003 as the new date for the Games. Also, the venue was changed to Hyderabad after Delhi pulled out. Most critics point to the successful hosting of the 32nd National Games of India, which were held at Hyderabad, as the main reason for Hyderabad being chosen.\nPreparation.\nThe Indian Government spent 1.03 billion (US$22.92 million), for the Afro-Asian Games, making these Games one of the most expensive sporting events held in Hyderabad. All preparations were completed within 60 days before the events began.\nGeneral preparation.\nThe Indian Olympic Association (IOA) decided to set up a central head of the development for the Games. Thus, the Afro-Asian Games Secretariat was set up at the \"Greenlands Guest House\" to organize, monitor and manage all the activities related to the Games. 17 functional organizing sub-committees were formed to oversee the development of the venues and other infrastructure. The various functions were divided within these committees. The special officer-in-charge of the Games was Sabyasachi Ghosh, while the Secretary-General of the Games was Ali Moradi.\nA large development Planning Association meant a great amount of inter-connectivity and communication requirements. A 24-hour call centre with interpreters was set up, using a Closed User Group (CUG) circuit.\nA large \"web\" of networking facilities was built to connect all the hotels, media centres, stadia and Transportation Committees. This would help in easing pressure on any one committee. Since the African continent is not very well-connected, an Accreditation Committee was dispatched to Abuja - in Nigeria - the host city of the 2003 All-Africa Games. The Accreditation committee brought all sports-persons and officials from Africa to Hyderabad.\nTechnology.\nThe software company CMC Limited had developed a Games and Event Management System (GEMS), which helped the organizers to efficiently manage events across the sports venues. It worked closely with Doordarshan, the official television broadcasters of the Games, to provide results of sporting competitions and live Games information. Additionally, cutting-edge technology like the implementation of geo-referenced maps and Geographic Information System (GIS) was implemented, so as to ensure a smooth and rapid flow of work.\nTransport.\nIn the month of September, less than a month away from the Afro-Asian Games, the Transport Ministry of Hyderabad released a large number of luxury vehicles, to be used in the Games. It was the second time in the span of one year that the Transport Ministry had done so - the first time being for the 32nd National Games of India. In an effort to spruce up the city in time for the Games, the organizers arranged several buses, vans and cars to ferry the athletes and the guests.\nAccommodation.\nAccommodation of the athletes and foreign officials posed a serious problem to the organisers. Contrary to what the Olympics and related multi-sport events provide, no actual Games Village was available for the athletes to stay. The Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh (SAAP) had initially wanted to have a separate Games Village for the Games, but could not arrange for it. Even though Hyderabad had hosted the 32nd National Games of India in 2002, for which a Games Village had been built, the organizers could not utilise it due to severe financial problems. It was estimated that about 800 million (US$16 million) would be required to upgrade the existing Games Village. The Government of Andhra Pradesh and the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh (SAAP) instead opted to obtain bulk bookings from all the major hotels in the city so as to provide accommodation for the athletes, foreign dignitaries and the media.\nSecurity.\nAbout 1400 police personnel were drawn from various districts of Andhra Pradesh to provide the first layer of security. In addition to this, over 5000 city policemen were deployed in various places, including the event venues and all the major hotels of the city. Strict anti-sabotage measures were taken to provide security at the athlete hotels. Also, a 24-hour access control system was placed, with sniffer dogs used to sanitise the area.\nTo facilitate foreign athletes and officials, four immigration counters were set up at the airport. A time limit of 30 minutes was laid down to clear any athlete or official. To improve security speed, six interpreters of Russian, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Korean, French and Arabic were present at the airport. In addition, 24 specially trained immigration personnel were stationed round the clock in the airport.\nPressure on Organizing Committee.\nThere was a lot of pressure upon the Secretariat for the smooth performance of these Games, as the IOA would keenly observe the Afro-Asian Games, in preparation for the 2010 Commonwealth Games at Delhi, India. Also, officials from Beijing, China - the venue of 2008 Summer Olympics - and Doha, Qatar - the host of 2006 Asian Games - would attend the Afro-Asian Games, and keenly observe the way the Games functioned.\nHowever, hosting of the Games was not the only major issue for the committee. The Afro-Asian Games would see the participation of various nations which are not in good terms with some other nations. The then Prime Minister of India, Atal Behari Vajpayee, had hinted that \"some nations might withdraw from the Games, rather than get embroiled in international conflicts\".\nMarketing.\nThe logo of the Afro-Asian Games was the Charminar - Hyderabad's most famous landmark - surrounded by a string of pearls. Hyderabad is also famous for its pearls. The official logo of the Games was unveiled, along with the official website, by Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu on 3 September 2003.\nThe Mascot for these Games was \"Sheroo\", also spelt \"Sheru\", a cartoon lion. Subsequently, a variation of the name 'Sheroo', called 'Shera', was also given for the mascot of the 2010 Commonwealth Games.\nSeveral Indian corporates such as Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), GVK Group and State Bank of Hyderabad provided sponsorships worth INR 10 million each towards the staging of several events of the inaugural Games. Several other corporates such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Videocon and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) also contributed to the Games. Also, Florida-based IMG Academy assisted in the conduct of the Games.\nParticipating countries.\nThe First Afro-Asian Games were the first time that Asia and Africa came together for such a large event. 43 Asian and 53 African nations participated in this sporting event.\nBelow is a list of all the participating countries in the Inaugural Afro-Asian Games.\nVenues.\nThe events of the Games were held across eight stadiums, spread throughout the suburb of Gachibowli. The venues were:\nSports.\nThe program of the Afro-Asian Games was almost the same as that of the Asian Games, the only difference being in the number of sports. These Games witnessed eight disciplines in eight sports. Synchronised swimming and diving were not contested.\nThe list of sports is given below \"(Number in parentheses indicates number of events)\".\nCalendar.\nThe 2003 Afro-Asian Games Calendar is given below.\nQualification.\nQualification for the Games depended upon the performance of the countries in other major multi-sport events. Since these Games featured delegations from two continents, the qualification criteria for nations from the different continents was different. The qualification of the African nations was based on their performance in the 2003 All-Africa Games held in Abuja, Nigeria. The qualification for the Asian nations was based on their performance in the 2002 Asian Games held in Busan, South Korea.\nMedia coverage.\nTelevision.\nThe official television host broadcaster of the Afro-Asian Games was DD Sports, India's first sports channel. The experience gained through broadcasting these Games would prove to be extremely helpful for its parent company Doordarshan, as they broadcast the 2004 Olympic Games live and would later telecast the 2010 Commonwealth Games. However, the schedule of the Games clashed with an ongoing Triangular Cricket Tournament, and the events were aired on DD Metro. Doordarshan deployed 350 personnel, 10 outdoor broadcasting vans and 86 cameras for obtaining coverage of the Games. Additionally, five cameras were used for the Sports news and the sidelights.\nRadio.\nIndia's premier radio broadcaster, the All India Radio (A.I.R), was the official radio partner of the Games. The AIR hired 150 programmers and engineers for the coverage of the Games.\nCeremonies.\nThe opening and closing ceremonies were described as \"eye-filling\" and \"opulent\" by several media centers. The ceremonies cost INR 150 million (US$3.34 million) to execute. Children from India, China and some African nations had practiced for a reported 21 days to ensure the success of the beginning and the end of the Inaugural Games. The settings utilised for the ceremonies were designed by well-known art director and film production designer Nitin Chandrakant Desai.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe Opening ceremony of the Games were held in the G. M. C. Balayogi Stadium - the main stadium of the events - at 5:30 pm IST. The organisers considered it as \"a benchmark of the Games\". The Opening ceremony of the Games showcased the cultural heritage of both the attending continents - Asia and Africa. 30,000 people came to watch the beginning of the gala sporting event. The ceremony, which was hosted by Bollywood actor Priyanka Chopra, was spread over a time period of two hours and forty minutes. Many celebrities, like actor Sanjay Dutt and tennis player Leander Paes graced the occasion. Also, six-time pole vault winner Sergey Bubka, along with his wife, attended the ceremony.\nAround 12,000 schoolchildren and college students came up with a show depicting the vast and vibrant culture of the two continents.\nChief Guest Deputy Prime Minister L. K. Advani declared the Games open. Shooter Anjali Bhagwat took the Athlete's Oath. This was followed by a laser show, fireworks and a space cannon show. The highlight of the Opening ceremony was the \"Umojas\" - a group of professional tribal dancers from Africa. There were other international showcases - the spiritual chanting by the Chinese monks, and the peace prayers by thousands of schoolchildren. Singer Shankar Mahadevan sang the theme song. Bollywood divas Shilpa Shetty, Simran and Urmila Matondkar did dance performances.\nUnlike the Olympic Games, there was no individual march past for the countries. The countries came in batches of two - Asian countries in one batch and African countries in another.\nClosing ceremony.\nThe closing ceremony of the Games was marked by lights, colour and technology.\nThe closing ceremony was hosted by Yukta Mookhey. President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam officially closed the Games, in front of a near capacity crowd. His closing words were : \"I congratulate all the athletes and officials who were part of the Games. When I see thousands of sportspersons I am sure the combined power of youth through sport will be the most powerful resource on earth.\" As he did so, the Stadium was lit up in a pyrotechnics display, and fireworks burst in the sky. A \"daredevil\" act was done by a few service personnel, who came riding on motorcycles. A fly-past of the Indian Army airplanes, trailing smoke in the colours of the Indian flag took place as the dignitaries took their seats.\nThe expected \"high-point\" of the closing ceremony was the show of camaraderie between the sportspersons of the two continents. However, few athletes trooped into the Stadium for that purpose. The \"camaraderie ceremony\" was followed by speeches of various important people, among them being IOA President Suresh Kalmadi, IOA and OCA Secretary-General Randhir Singh, ANOCA President Alfa Ibrahim Diallo, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu and Union Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports Vikram Verma. The speeches were shortly followed by a memento presentation.\nAs night fell, hundreds of Army recruits brought lighted torches, and did the \"mashal dance\". Laser lights and several technological innovations followed. Sheroo, the mascot, was bid farewell by noted Indian singer Hariharan and many costumed children. The \"Umojas\" performed yet again at the closing ceremony. The Chinese State circus was considered \"breath-taking\". Lebanese singer Diana Haddad, Egyptian singer Hisham Abbas and Indian singer Remo Fernandes performed at the closing ceremony as well.\nThe host country was portrayed by a number of traditional folk dances, after which the Games officially ended.\nMedal table.\nThe official medal tally of the Afro-Asian Games is given below. China bagged the largest number of gold medals, followed by the host India in second place. Athletes from India won the most number of total medals, with 80.\nLegacy.\nThe success of the Games was a point in favor of India being able to host a major international sporting event. Subsequently, this success was used in the bidding of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, which was ultimately awarded to Delhi.\nIn addition, the hospitality sector received a major boost due to the games, as hotels and guest houses received large booking orders from people who were coming to see the Games – media-persons, delegates, officials, visitors, sports-persons, etc. Tourism also benefited from the Games, and the State Tourism Department showed many foreign journalists key tourism spots in the city. Many famous places such as the Charminar and the Chowmahalla Palace saw record number of visitors.\nAlso, famous local markets witnessed exceptional growth in sales and business, as demand peaked during the Games. Business of the world-renowned pearls of Hyderabad increased by about 50%, generating revenue of 50 million in one week. The rise in buyers was mainly driven by African visitors, who prefer pearls as jewellery. Also, sale of gold jewellery increased substantially, being driven by a large number of Muslim visitors who looked for traditional and intricate designs. In addition, bangles became the center of attraction for Chinese and African athletes."

The controversy was garnered as some of the positions, such as catcher, which in question was Ryutaro Umeno, were voted in for the sole purpose of being voted in by fans, as he did not produce numbers good enough to be considered an All Star Game appearance, compared to that of a player like Takumi Ohshiro. Others, like Teruaki Sato at 3rd base, were good, but there had been players who were much more deserving to start, like Toshiro Miyazaki and Kazuma Okamoto."

A total of 142 matches have been played, with England having won 76 times, Scotland 47 times and nineteen matches have been drawn.\nApart from fixtures played in the Home/Five/Six Nations Championship competitions, two games have been played at the Rugby World Cup: the 1991 Semi-final and the 2011 Pool B fixture, both of which England were victorious. The sides also met in 1971 in a match to commemorate the centenary of the first match between the sides, which Scotland were victorious in both fixtures.\nThe 1938 Calcutta Cup match was the first live televised rugby international. It was broadcast by BBC Television. \nThe first two international sides to play against each other, the England–Scotland fixture is the second most-played international rugby union match as of 2023. Behind the Australia–New Zealand rivalry by some thirty-plus matches (not including XV results), it is one match ahead of the England–Ireland match-up and the Ireland–Scotland match-up.\nCalcutta Cup.\nThe teams have consistently been competing for the Calcutta Cup annually since 1879, or their ninth match-up together. Used in a one-off match, the Cup first took part in the Home Nations friendlies of the 1870s and early '80s. It is now one trophy of many used between the six teams that make up the Six Nations Championship."

        "title": "European Rugby Club Rankings",
        "text": "The European Rugby Club Rankings were introduced for the 2008–09 European season. They were based on the points earned by teams in the now defunct Heineken Cup and the European Challenge Cup over the past four years. They were used to aid in the seeding process for the Heineken Cup and the European Challenge Cup. For the Heineken Cup the first four tiers are defined by these rankings. In addition, the Cup holder is automatically added to the top tier.\nStarting with the 2009–10 season, the rankings have the potential to determine one entrant in the following season's Heineken Cup. If England or France produces winners of both European cups in a season, a Heineken Cup berth will be awarded to the highest-ranked team not from that nation and not already qualified to the Heineken Cup. (The winners of both cups receive automatic berths in the next season's Heineken Cup, separately from the allocations of their countries; however, England and France are capped at seven Heineken Cup places apiece.) This scenario will also apply if either of Scotland's two professional teams wins either European cup, since those teams are automatically entered in the Heineken Cup at the start of each season.\nCurrent rankings.\nPer ERC rule, ties between clubs are broken as follows:\nFor example, Harlequins and Cardiff Blues are tied on 15 points. Both participated in the 2012–13 Heineken Cup where Harlequins earned 5 points (reached the quarter final) whereas Cardiff only earned 2 points (finished 3rd in their pool). Therefore, Harlequins are ranked higher than Cardiff. \nAnother example: Edinburgh and London Wasps are tied on 11 points. Edinburgh participated in the 2012–13 Heineken Cup (and earned 1 point for finishing 4th in their pool) whereas Wasps played in the 2012–13 European Challenge Cup (and earned 2 points for reaching the quarter finals). Wasps are ranked below Edinburgh even though they earned more points in the 2012–13 season.\nNote that a ranking is not necessary for a club to participate in European competition. For example, among the 20 clubs that began the 2011–12 Challenge Cup, only nine had a ranking at the start of that season. In order for a club to be ranked, it must have, in the previous four seasons, either (1) participated in the Heineken Cup or (2) advanced from the pool stage of the Challenge Cup.\nPoints are earned using the following criteria.\nHeineken Cup\nPool winners earn the higher of the two figures given for the knock out stages, while pool runners-up receive the lower figure.\nEuropean Challenge Cup\n\"*Heineken Cup Teams will have picked up 3 points by finishing runner-up in their Heineken Cup Pool\""

After 4 victories in the tournament, they took 10th place overall.\nThree years later, in Fukuoka, Japan, it finished worse when it was able to score in only two matches: in the basic group with Brazil and in the match for 11th place with Kazakhstan.\nAt the World Championships 2003, organized by the Spanish Barcelona and where the competition system changed, the team advanced to the round of 16.

        "text": "Ice hockey has been played in Croatia at least since the late 19th century. It became organised on the national level in 1935 with the establishment of the Croatian Ice Hockey Federation, and at this period Croatian teams were playing in the Yugoslav Ice Hockey League. During the 1960s, Group B of the 1966 World Ice Hockey Championships took place in Zagreb, and KHL Medveščak Zagreb became a leading team, winning the national championship on several occasions. The breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991 led to the formation of the Croatian Ice Hockey League.\nPrior to World War II.\nOn November 9, 1935 the Association for Skating and Ice Hockey was founded in Zagreb, although ice hockey in Croatia had been inherent for some 30 years, considering that Franjo Bučar, the father of Croatian sport, had founded skating section in 1894. \nFirst game on natural ice was played in the winter of 1916 between HAŠK (Croatian Academic Sport Club) and PHŠD (First Croatian Sport Society). In 1922, the Zagreb Winter Sub-federation was founded which included skating, ice hockey and alpine skiing. \nThe first game by Canadian rules was played on February 3, 1924 between HAŠK and ZKD (Zagreb Skating Society) on ice next to the former Esplanade Hotel, which HAŠK won with 4:1. \nThe real uplift of the Croatian ice hockey was in 1930 when 3 clubs were founded, but as sections within the major sports companies: Marathon, Concordia and Karlovačko Športsko Udruženje. Other clubs were Sisak founded in 1931 as a part of Slavija Sports Society and KHL Varaždin founded in 1935. \nIn the late 1930s hockey teams from Croatia participated in the Yugoslav Hockey League. Initially the best clubs from various republics were promoted to the playoffs. Croatia hence had its own division in this league with clubs from Zagreb, Sisak, Karlovac and Varaždin.\nAfter World War II.\nA period of years after the Second World War is considered as the most prosperous for Croatian ice hockey and is associated with the name of Dragutin Friedrich. In 1946 he founded KHL Mladost which was a champion of SFR Yugoslavia in 1947 and 1949. \nIn 1947, SD Zagreb was founded and the club won the championship of Yugoslavia in 1956. In the early 1960s due to the crisis and the lack of funds for this sport, KHL Zagreb and the new KHL Medveščak Zagreb merged and the new club continued to work under the name KHL Medveščak. The same club got the first artificial ice in Croatia in Šalata. \nAfter that in 1966 Zagreb got the organization of a World Championship, group B. Due to completion of Dom Sportova in 1972 players got second artificial ice and in 1984 Croatian Ice Hockey Federation became independent.\nIn 1986, KHL Zagreb was established.\nThen, with significant economic support, KHL Medveščak won the championship of Yugoslavia in 1989, 1990 and 1991 and Yugoslav cup in 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1991.\nPost 1991.\nWith disintegration of Yugoslavia Croatian Ice Hockey League was established and since 1991 it operates under its present name. In 1992 Croatian Ice Hockey Federation became a member of IIHF."

Before the 1884 season, Harry Wright took over as the Phillies manager, and liked McElroy's talent. He threw extremely hard, but was very wild. In his 14 starts, there were seven different catchers who caught him, four of whom claimed that McElroy was the first pitcher they had ever caught at the major league level.

The Illini play on campus at historic 1,500-seat University of Illinois Ice Arena. They are a member of the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) at the ACHA Division I level. The team is a former member of the Central States Collegiate Hockey League (CSCHL) within the ACHA. The team operates as a registered student organization (RSO) at the University of Illinois. The university does not currently have an NCAA varsity team, and thus the club team is the highest level of hockey offered by the university. A feasibility study published in March 2018, and commissioned by the NHL, NHLPA, and College Hockey, Inc., found a high probability of success for the hockey program to transition to NCAA Division I. Illinois however reversed course in May 2022, announcing that they were no longer exploring adding a varsity hockey program.\nHistory.\nOrganized ice hockey came to Illinois in the 1930s and played its first official season in 1937 as an independent NCAA team. The first head coach was Ray Eliot, who coached the Fightin' Illini from 1937 to 1939. The team went winless in the 1937–38 season, going 0–4 before winning their first game in the following season. Vic Heyliger, a former All-American at Michigan and professional player with the Chicago Blackhawks, took over as head coach for the 1939–40 season. In this second year as Illini head coach he led the team to a 17-win season, the most successful season of the Illini NCAA ice hockey team. The team recorded a 10-win season in 1941–42 and a 9-win season in 1942–43 that included only a single loss. The program was ended after the 1942–43 season during World War II; that same year in 1943 Heyliger came out of retirement for 1943–44 season to fill in the team's depleted war time roster.\nThe current Fighting Illini men's ice hockey team formed in the post-war era during the mid-1950s. The team joined the CSCHL in 1975, only 5 years after the league formed, making the Illini the longest on-going CSCHL members.\nSeason-by-season results.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points\""

Morgan was a collier by profession.\nRugby career.\nAlthough Morgan had little international success in rugby, he is more notable for being part of the Llanelli squad that hosted the touring New Zealand Natives on 19 December 1888. This was the first ever match played in Wales by a touring Southern Hemisphere team, and the Māori team had just come from wins over Broughton Rangers and Wigan. The match was decided by a single dropped goal, scored by Llanelli's Harry Bowen from near the halfway line, which Morgan had set up after he forced the New Zealanders to minor when his kick passed their line.\nMorgan was one of a small group of players from Llanelli Rugby Club, who gained international caps in the late 1880s, but played little more than a handful of games. Morgan played just a single game for his country, a home match at St. Helen's in Swansea, against Ireland as part of the 1889 Home Nations Championship. Among the Welsh team on that day were four Llanelli players, though none had been selected for the opening game of the tournament against Scotland. Morgan's club team-mates for that match included Giotto Griffiths, Ned Roberts and Dan Griffiths. This would be the last international game for all four players. Ireland won the game by two tries to nil, both of the scores coming from Irish debuts. Morgan lost his place in the Welsh squad the next season to Penarth's Dickie Garrett, and didn't play for Wales again.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

Only Daytona 500 start for Sam Sommers. Last Daytona 500 starts for Bob Burcham, Terry Ryan, Walter Ballard, Salt Walther, Ramo Stott, Ed Negre, and Jim Hurtubise.\nSummary.\nCale Yarborough won his second Daytona 500 and it would lead to his second straight Winston Cup title, and Donnie Allison won his second pole position for this event. Janet Guthrie made history at this race as the first female NASCAR Cup Series driver; getting a 12th place finish in the process.\nBobby Wawak bailed out of his car while it was still moving and on fire on lap 3. Seconds later the car slammed the inside wall by the entrance to pit road. Wawak got 15% burns on his body on his face which was second degree, first degree on his hands and one of his legs and was taken to hospital. Chris Economaki who was reporting in the pits for ABC Sports said \"The doctors told him if he had fire retardant underwear on (Gloves, socks and a balaclava) he would not be injured at all\". Three Time Formula One World Champion Jackie Stewart who was commentating on the race for ABC Sports said \"The drivers themselves are negligent, drivers should always wear flame resistant underwear and thermal underwear. The accident we seen today is just typical if your not properly protected\".\nThe race resulted in the first Top 10 finish for Jimmy Means, the final Top 10 finish for Bob Burcham, and the last Top 5 finish for the late Coo Coo Marlin.\nJim Vandiver retired from the NASCAR Winston Cup Series after this race. Richard Petty started the race 7/8 from pit lane in last place. He caught a break with the caution for Wawak's fire then worked his way through the field back into contention only to later blow the engine and drop out. Donnie Allison blew a tire at the start/finish line on lap 88, and was forced to limp into the pits, where his team discovered too much damage had been done, so they pulled the car out of the race.\nDefending Daytona 500 David Pearson also had mechanical issues. The Silver Fox led two laps but like Petty, his #21 Purolator Mercury was sidelined with a blown engine before the 3/4 mark. USAC Champ Car racer Salt Walther's last NASCAR Cup start ended in a backstretch crash. A gust of wind caught Walther's self-owned #4 Chevrolet and caused him to lose it triggering a three-car incident that also included Buddy Baker and Dave Marcis. Baker recovered to finish third but Salt was done for the day.\nOnce Petty and Pearson were gone the race came down to a battle between Cale Yarborough and Benny Parsons that saw Yarborough eventually prevail."

        "title": "Mini rugby",
        "text": "Mini rugby, also known as New Image Rugby, is a form of rugby union designed to introduce the sport to children. It uses a smaller ball and pitch than standard rugby, and has eight to ten players a side.\nInvented in England in 1970, mini rugby was soon taken up by both the English Rugby Football Union (RFU) and the Welsh Rugby Union.\nThe original game had five backs and four forwards. There were no line-outs and no pushing in the scrum, which was made up of a prop, a hooker, a lock and a flanker. Each position behind the scrum in the senior game was represented by a scrum half, an outside half, a centre, a wing and a fullback.\nThe International Rugby Board does not directly govern very junior levels of rugby but rather leaves local bodies to do things as they see fit. Consequently, different countries have different junior versions of rugby designed to appeal to, and be safe for, younger children.\nMini Rugby in England.\nTechnically, the RFU's regulations for age-grade rugby under the age of 13 are collectively known as \"the rugby continuum\", and \"mini rugby\" is just one of the stages of that continuum, and one part of that continuum is known as \"Mini Rugby.\" However, \"mini rugby\" is much less of a mouthful and often used to refer to all age groups under the age of 13.\nThe age grade of a player is determined by his or her age at the start of the junior season, which is midnight on 31 August. An \"under-8\", for example, must start the season aged 7, but may turn 8 during the season and will carry on playing as an under-8 until the start of the next season. This ties in with the school year and as a result, if you add 5 to their school year you will get their rugby age group. For example, school year 2s are rugby Under-7s. School year 7s (first secondary year) are rugby Under-12s.\nThere are 3 stages to the rugby continuum.\nAges under-13 to under-19 are then sometimes referred to as \"youth rugby\", where the game is only modified from the senior game in relatively minor ways. Some modifications may include the need for both feet to be placed in the ground at all times, so no diving to score a try, the team must consist of no more than seven players but at least five, in senior rugby there are fifteen players in one game, free passes are given if a player accidentally throws a ball forward, balls cannot be stripped from a players hands, and kicking is not allowed in youth rugby “rookie rugby.” The differences between the two types of play seem to be different, but all the rules of the game have the same intention.\nThe rule changes based on the rugby continuum are designed to make the game both safe and enjoyable for the level of physical and intellectual development expected in any given age group.\nHere is a summary of the modifications to the International Rugby Board (IRB)'s Laws of the game:\nContinuum Stage 1: U7 &amp; U8 (Mini Tag Rugby).\nU7 and U8 rugby is played on a relatively small pitch with cloth strips (tags) that are attached to a belt with velcro. Tackling in \"Mini Rugby\" is replaced by tagging. Tagging is the removal of one of a players tags attached to their belts. And with tagging, it helps reduce the risk of early injuries and health related issues. The game is simplified for the younger generations to understand the concept of consistently running and passing.\nContinuum Stage 2: U9 &amp; U10 (Mini Rugby).\nU9 and U10 rugby is played with tackling instead of tagging and the game becomes more physical as age increases. However scrums are NOT allowed in U9 rugby. In U10 scrums are allowed. Scrums consist of three players from each team. The scrum is uncontested and whichever team wins the scrum gets rewarded the ball, which will then be thrown to the winning team to start a play. There are an equal number of players for both sides, a maximum of seven for U9 and maximum of eight for U10.\nContinuum Stage 3: U11 &amp; U12 (Midi Rugby).\nU11 rugby consists of twelve players, five of whom who participate in the scrum, while in U12 rugby consists of thirteen players, six of whom who participate in a scrum. What starts the game is a drop kick. After the ball is drop kicked to the opposing team, they will then gather the ball and decide if they want to keep it in play, having the ball drop kicked again, or beginning a scrum in the center of the field. Player can also be called for aggressive actions which include, high/late tackling, an offside, kicking, or an obstruction to the player or the ball. Rucks are also allowed.\nOther names.\nMini rugby is known in Wales as \"dragon rugby\", and Australia as \"walla rugby\". In Ireland the under-7s version of mini rugby is a touch or tag game with no set pieces known as \"leprechaun rugby\".\nFamous mini rugby players.\nEngland:\nWell-known English players who came up through the mini rugby system include Jeremy Guscott and Ben Clarke.\nUnited States:\nWell-known players from the United States include Garrett Bender, Andrew Durutalo, Zack Test, Chris Wyles, Ben Pinkelman, Madison Hughes.\nAustralia:\nMore well-known players from Australia include Nathan Sharpe, Adam Ashley-Cooper, Tatafu Polota-Nau, Benn Robinson, Kurtely Beale, Berrick Barnes.\nMidi rugby.\nMidi rugby is the \"bridge\" between mini rugby and the full game. It is played twelve a-side. For the under 12s this is altered to 13 a-side."

He played for the Florida Marlins of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1998 to 1999. He also has played for the Panama national baseball team.\nCareer.\nMedina was originally signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1992. He began his professional career the following year with the Yankees' rookie team, then spent 1994 with the Oneonta Yankees, where he had a win–loss record of 3-7 and a 4.66 earned run average (ERA) in 14 games. He split 1995 with the Greensboro Bats and Tampa Yankees. With Tampa, he had a 2.37 ERA in six games. Medina was promoted to the Norwich Navigators, and had a 5-8 record, a 3.06 ERA, and 112 strikeouts in 19 games. After the 1996 season ended, he was traded to the San Diego Padres with Rubén Rivera for Hideki Irabu and Homer Bush.\nMedina spent 1997 with the Las Vegas Stars, the Padres' AAA affiliate. He had a 7.56 ERA in 13 games, and scouts no longer considered him a top prospect like they had a season prior due to the poor stats and a lack of confidence. After a season with the Padres, they traded him to the Florida Marlins with Steve Hoff and Derrek Lee for Kevin Brown. With the Marlins, he made the opening day roster, and pitched in 12 games for the team in 1998, going 2-6 with a 6.01 ERA. The Marlins then tried using Medina as a relief pitcher, and he split 1999 with Florida and the Calgary Cannons. With the major league squad he had a 5.79 ERA in 20 games.\nAfter the season, Medina was picked up by the Atlanta Braves. He spent the next two seasons with the Syracuse SkyChiefs and the Memphis Redbirds, then spent 2002 with the Algodoneros de Torreón of the Mexican League. He spent two more seasons playing professional baseball, then joined the Panama national baseball team. He was part of the team during the 2009 World Baseball Classic, and pitched a third of an inning in one game."

        "text": "Robert Bruce Adams (born August 15, 1946) is a former professional American football tight end in the National Football League (NFL) and a spokesperson for the Church of Scientology International. He attended El Camino High School during the 1960s, and was encouraged by a coach at the College of San Mateo to play football. He played for a single season at the college, during 1966, while participating in other sports at the school including track-and-field and basketball. A former coach of the College of San Mateo, Doug Scovil, recruited Adams to the College of the Pacific, where he received a full scholarship to play football there. By 1968, he was captain of the team's offense at the school.\nHe was not drafted by the National Football League, and was signed as a free agent with the Pittsburgh Steelers, where he played under coach Chuck Noll. In 1973 while a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Adams became a Scientologist. He said applying Scientology methodology helped his performance playing football. After seven years with the National Football League, Adams finished his pro-career as a member of the Atlanta Falcons. He subsequently took up other professions, including owning a fitness center in Redwood City, California, being a consultant for high tech companies, and working as a teacher.\nIn 2004, Adams served within the Scientology organization as senior vice president of its Association for Better Living and Education (ABLE), a nonprofit founded by Scientology members in 1988 to supervise the secular programs Narconon, Criminon, The Way to Happiness, and Applied Scholastics. By 2006 he had become a media executive and vice president of the Church of Scientology, and worked out of the organization's facilities in Hollywood, California. He represented the Church of Scientology at the 2006 conference of the Religion Newswriters Association in Utah. Adams held the position of vice president of public affairs for the Church of Scientology International in 2009, and was a Reverend within the organization. He traveled to Melbourne, Australia in December 2009 for the World Religions Conference. He continued to serve as vice president of the Church of Scientology International in 2010, and was one of four officials listed as spokespersons for the church.\nEarly life and education.\nRobert Bruce Adams was born August 15, 1946, in Stockton, California. He attended El Camino High School during the 1960s, and quit playing American football during his senior year at the school, due to his small stature. After high school, he went to College of San Mateo, and a coach named Stu Carter noticed Adams while he was weight lifting at the college. Carter convinced Adams to play football, and he played for a single season at the College of San Mateo; during 1966. Adams concurrently played track-and-field and basketball at the College of San Mateo.\nAfter the College of San Mateo, he participated in football at University of the Pacific. He had played tight end at the College of San Mateo, and a former coach at the school, Doug Scovil, took interest in him. Scovill was managing the football program called College of the Pacific in Stockton, California; he offered Adams a full scholarship to play football. Adams's friend, Walt Harris, was a football player under Scovil; this combined with the full scholarship opportunity convinced Adams to join. He was a football player at College of the Pacific for two seasons, and by his senior year at the school in 1968 had become captain of the team's offense.\nNational Football League.\nAdams was signed as a free agent by the Pittsburgh Steelers, after he was not drafted by the National Football League. His contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers was for a US$1,000 signing bonus, and $15,000 contract. Chuck Noll, a new coach in the National Football League, supervised Adams's initial performance as a pro-football player. Adams played for the Pittsburgh Steelers in the position of tight end. He became a member of the Church of Scientology in 1973, while playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Adams told \"Newsweek\" that he joined the church because he was looking for \"assistance to become a better football player, teacher and parent ... [Scientology] was simple, precise, workable, and I saw effects immediately on the field.\" While a member of the New England Patriots in 1974, Adams attended an event held in Boston, Massachusetts sponsored by the Scientology organization, called the New England Conference on Drug Abuse. Adams ended his pro-football career playing with the Atlanta Falcons; he earned a salary of $54,000 in his final year with the team. Adams played for seven years in the National Football League.\nScientology official.\nABLE senior vice president.\nAfter finishing his career with the National Football League, Adams took up multiple other professions. He worked as a consultant for high tech companies, and as a teacher and author. He was the owner of an exercise facility in Redwood City, California. The Scientology publication \"Freewinds\" noted in 1990 that Adams had completed the highest Operating Thetan level of spiritual advancement, OT VIII. In 2004, Adams served as senior vice president of the Association for Better Living and Education (ABLE), a nonprofit founded by Scientology members in 1988 to supervise the secular programs Narconon, Criminon, The Way to Happiness, and Applied Scholastics. In an interview with the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", Adams objected to an assessment that international Scientology management ran the subdivisions of ABLE. Adams stated, \"ABLE does not report its statistics to the church.\" He commented on the purpose of Narconon, \"We feel we're on a mission, and it's for the good of all of us. It's part of the overall plan to collaborate with other groups and bring about a shift in the culture with regard to drug education, prevention and rehabilitation.\"\nCSI vice president.\nAdams worked in 2006 as a media executive for the Scientology organization out of its offices in Hollywood, California; he was a vice president of the Church of Scientology International in 2006. He represented the Church of Scientology at the 2006 conference of the Religion Newswriters Association in Utah, and participated in a panel discussion called, \"Faiths That Don't Fit: Classifying and Reporting on 'Other' Churches\". Adams discussed the Scientology policy of \"fair game\" in a 2008 interview with \"The Times\": \"That policy (of fair game) was yanked very quickly. As in any organisation made up of lots of people, some will be internal renegades, if you will. Those people paid the price. And those days are over now.\"\nIn 2008, Adams served as vice president of the Church of Scientology International. When asked in a January 2008 interview with \"The New Yorker\" about the Scientology story involving a galactic ruler named Xenu, Adams responded, \"A small fraction of our scriptures are confidential, and I don't want to allude to something confidential.\" He asserted that the controversial Scientology program the \"Rehabilitation Project Force\" (RPF) was a \"volunteer program for self-improvement\". Adams commented about the RPF, \"They get frequent breaks, eight hours of sleep, and three healthy meals. The principal part is auditing, but the physical activity is very extrovertive for the individual and is found to be very therapeutic in itself.\" Adams was interviewed on the National Public Radio program \"Morning Edition\" in 2008 about the activism against Scientology by the Internet-based protest group Anonymous; he referred to the group as \"cyber criminals\", and commented: \"It's very reminiscent of days gone by and current days with the KKK, wearing masks, hiding, having secret meetings on the Internet.\"\nSpokesperson.\nHe held the position of vice president of public affairs for the Church of Scientology International in 2009, and was a Reverend within the organization. Adams traveled to Melbourne, Australia in December 2009 for the World Religions Conference. In an appearance on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio program hosted by Tony Eastley, \"AM\", Adams stated, \"From one church in 1954 to ... we're in 165 nations now; we have 8,000 churches, missions and groups right across this fair earth of ours.\" Adams disputed assertions of abuse within Scientology publicized on the floor of the Australian Senate by Senator Nick Xenophon and commented, \"It's not that the allegations aren't serious charges; the fact of the matter is that they are unsubstantiated rumours. Many of these so-called charges, so-called allegations are very old. I mean, 12 or 15 years ago, these incidents occurred, were thoroughly reviewed.\" Regarding statements by Senator Xenophon that women within Scientology who became pregnant were pressured into having abortions, Adams said, \"That's someone's statement of... it's totally false. There's no proof whatsoever; no one has ever made... no one has come forward and said here's the proof.\" Adams asserted to \"The Age\" that all of the critical statements made by Senator Xenophon about Scientology in the Australian Senate were \"meritless\". He commented, \"One way to measure that is how law enforcement responds to any of these allegations. There has been no interest because there has been no evidence. Apostates are not credible witnesses, like former spouses or employees - they are trying to find a reason why they departed.\"\nIn July 2010 the Church of Scientology International publicized a \"Scientology Newsroom\" website tailored for members of the media; Adams was one of four international representatives for Scientology listed as \"Spokespersons\". Adams served as vice president of the Church of Scientology International in 2010. In his role as Scientology spokesman, he commented to \"The Seattle Times\" in August 2010 that critical articles including revelations from former members published in that year by the \"St. Petersburg Times\" of Florida were \"based on lies by 'apostates' who want to see the church fail\". Adams asserted, \"The history of all new religions is they go through a time of trial where the public is skeptical.\" He stated that increased attention in the media to the organization could help to recruit more members, \"It's a new religion. Whatever publicity we get, people are curious.\"\nPersonal life.\nAdams's first child was born December 8, 1971. In 1972, Adams and his wife Marilyn resided with their baby son in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; they had a house in Bethel Park. In 2006, Adams was divorced, and had one child."

He was the Santa Ana College's Athlete of the Year and the Eastern Conference Lineman of the Year. He was drafted in 1961 by the Los Angeles Rams in the ninth round of the NFL draft.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nDuane Allen was born in Alhambra, California on October 21, 1937. He attended Alhambra High School, where he earned All-Southern California prep football honors. Allen did not play football at a four-year college but was twice a Junior College All-American while attending Mt. San Antonio College in 1956 and Santa Ana College in 1960. While at Santa Ana College Allen majored in police science.\nProfessional career.\nAllen was drafted by the Los Angeles Rams in the 9th round of the 1961 NFL draft. He was also courted by the San Diego Chargers of the rival American Football League (AFL). He was originally slated to play defensive back at the time of his entry into the league, but due to his size and speed he impressed as an offensive receiver at the Rams' 1961 training camp and was switched to that position. Little used during his rookie campaign, Allen did catch two passes for 80 yards and two touchdowns in 1961.\nAllen's sophomore campaign with the Rams in 1962 would be a brief one, catching a touchdown against the San Francisco 49ers on October 28 before being forced to leave the game with a season-ending knee injury.\nAllen ultimately spent seven years in the NFL playing for the Los Angeles Rams (1961–64), Pittsburgh Steelers (1965), and Chicago Bears (1966–67).\nLife after professional football.\nFollowing his retirement from the National Football League, Allen coached high school football and track and served as head coach of the Las Vegas Cowboys of the short-lived Continental Football League (COFL).\nOff the field Allen was an accomplished pianist and composer. He appeared in the 1975 Richard Fleischer movie, Mandingo, as \"Topaze.\" \nAllen was elected to the Santa Ana Dons Hall of Fame in 2003.\nHe died at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena after having suffered a stroke on May 7th, 2003."

        "title": "Ireland national rugby sevens team",
        "text": "The Ireland national rugby sevens team competes in several international rugby sevens competitions. The team is governed by the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU).\nIreland competes as a \"core team\" on the World Rugby Sevens Series, a competition every year from December to June that includes ten tournaments staged around the globe. The 2019–20 season is Ireland's first season as a core team. At the 2019 Hong Kong Sevens Ireland won the World Series Qualifier tournament for the 2019–20 World Rugby Sevens Series, earning \"core team\" status for the first time. Prior to this Ireland had competed in individual tournaments within World Rugby Sevens Series, though not as a core team. Ireland's became the first non-core side to medal at a World Series tournament at the 2018 London Sevens, where they finished in third place. Since their inclusion as a core side, they have earned 2nd place finishes twice, at the 2022 France Sevens and the 2022 Dubai Sevens.\nIreland also competes in major quadrennial rugby sevens tournaments and their qualifying tournaments. Ireland has competed in most Rugby World Cup Sevens since the 1993 inaugural event, with their best results including finishing third in 1993 and 2022. The team also competes during qualifying for the Summer Olympics, but failed to qualify for the inaugural rugby sevens competition at the 2016 Summer Olympics. On 20 June 2021 Ireland qualified for the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nFollowing the announcement in 2009 that rugby sevens would be an Olympic sport beginning in 2016, the Irish Rugby Football Union created a men's rugby sevens program in 2014. In 2015 the IRFU announced its goal to field a national sevens team that would qualify for the Summer Olympics and the World Rugby Sevens Series. Ireland has since begun offering professional contracts to its squad of sevens players. In 2022 Ireland equalled their best ever World Cup Sevens performance, winning the bronze medal.\nIreland also participates in the Rugby Europe Sevens Series.\nHistory.\nIreland competed at the 1973 International Seven-A-Side Tournament, the first rugby sevens tournament for national teams. They defeated New Zealand, Australia and Scotland in the groups phase, before losing to England in the finals.\nOlympic era (2009–present).\nIreland has increased its emphasis in rugby sevens since the International Olympic Committee voted in 2009 to restore rugby to the events program in 2016. In March 2011, the IRFU announced its support for Shamrock Warriors RFC. The club's aim is to develop a pool of experienced Sevens players for the IRFU to be in position to select to develop into a future international Sevens squad to compete in tournaments by giving them experience playing in the top level competition should the IRFU become involved in professional international sevens or in the Olympic Sevens.\nAlthough rugby was announced in 2009 as an Olympic sport, the IRFU was slow to recognize the opportunity. As of September 2013, the IRFU said it was unlikely to send a sevens team to the 2016 Summer Olympics. The IRFU did not introduce a men's rugby sevens national team program until October 2014. The IRFU announced in December 2014 the hiring of Anthony Eddy as the Director of Irish rugby sevens, both the men's and women's teams.\nIn December 2014 the IRFU issued a notice to all Irish athletes to see what if could become an Elite Sevens rugby player. The IRFU hoped to see the best rugby club talent available as well as attracting athletes with transferable skills from other team sports such as athletics, basketball, and Gaelic Games. The IRFU held four talent identification days across Ireland in January 2015.\nThe IRFU announced in May 2015 its brand new 27-man squad for the 2015 season, selected out of a pool of more than 300 applicants, a squad that later became known as \"The Originals\". The new team started at the bottom, beginning the 2015 season in Europe's Division C, with an eye towards gaining promotion to higher levels of competition. The highlight of Ireland's 2015 and 2016 seasons was the attempt to qualify for the 2016 Summer Olympics. At the 2015 Europe Olympic Repechage Tournament, Ireland finished with 4–1–1 record, and despite a 10–24 semifinal loss to Russia, their third-place finish gained the last European slot for the 2016 Final Olympic Qualification Tournament. At the 2016 Final Olympic Qualifying Tournament, Ireland finished pool play with a 3–0 record including a 27–21 win over Samoa. However, a quarterfinal loss to Spain (7–12) eliminated them from the 2016 Summer Olympics.\nEntering the 2017 season, with the Irish men's rugby sevens program in place for just over two years, the IRFU still had not handed out any full-time professional contracts to any sevens players.\nFor the 2017 summer season, Ireland played in the European Grand Prix Sevens, which included four tournaments during summer 2017. Ireland began the Grand Prix by winning the first tournament, the 2017 Moscow Sevens, defeating Spain 12–0 in the final.\nFor the 2017–18 season, Ireland selected a core squad of 14 players that would prioritize Sevens play for the autumn 2017 tournaments, although they are not full-time Sevens players, and they retain their club status. Ireland finished ninth at the 2017 Silicon Valley Sevens with a 3–2 record; their record against World Series core teams was a respectable 2–2, with two wins over Canada.\nAs of December 2018 the IRFU was due to announce shortly their first-ever professional contracts for sevens players. In May 2019, despite the squad qualifying for the World Rugby Sevens Series, the IRFU announced that players would remain on an €18,000 basic annual salary with bonuses of €500 for participating in each of the 10 World Series tournaments — the equivalent of a development contract.\nIn March 2022, Anthony Eddy stepped down both as IRFU director of women's rugby and 7's rugby. Ireland secured their best ever overall finish in the World Rugby Sevens Series with a 5th place finish in the 2021–22 series. Later that year, Ireland equalled its best World Cup Sevens performance, winning the bronze medal for the second time (the first in 1993). Terry Kennedy capped off the program's successful season, by winning the World Rugby Sevens Player of the Year, mirroring the achievement of his XV's countrymen and counterpart, Josh van der Flier.\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nThe following players have been selected to represent Ireland during the 2023–24 SVNS tournament beginning in December 2023.\nWorld Rugby Sevens Series.\nIreland had a sparse participation in the World Rugby Sevens Series until 2019. Between 1999 and 2019 Ireland appeared only sporadically, and not as one of the core teams that participated in every tournament. Ireland played in very few tournaments on the World Series, such as the occasional trip to the Hong Kong Sevens. Ireland has had some limited success in the World Series tournaments in which it has played.\nIreland competed in two of the ten tournaments of the inaugural 1999–2000 World Sevens Series: at the 2000 Hong Kong Sevens, Ireland finished 17th to win the Bowl with a 4–2 record; at the 2000 Paris Sevens, Ireland finished tied for 11th with a 3–2 record. The following season, in the 2000–01 World Sevens Series, Ireland played in the 2000 Dubai Sevens where they finished 9th, winning the Bowl with a 4–2 record, including a 19–17 semifinal win over Wales.\nIreland has, however, since assembling a permanent sevens program in 2014, publicly stated in 2014 and again in 2015 that its goal is to qualify as one of the 15 core teams in the World Series. At the 2018 Hong Kong Sevens qualifying tournament for the 2018–19 World Series, Ireland posted a 3–0 record in pool play, winning all three matches by comfortable 20+ point margins, to advance to the knockout rounds. Ireland defeated Zimbabwe 38–5 in the quarterfinals, but lost to Japan 7–12 in the semifinal and failed to qualify for the 2018-19 World Series.\nIreland competed as an invitational team at the 2018 London Sevens and the 2018 Paris Sevens. At the 2018 London Sevens Ireland defeated the favoured United States and England teams en route to finishing third overall.\nAt the penultimate World Rugby Sevens Series event in London in 2018, the Irish team \"stole the show\", finishing in third place in their first World Series tournament since 2004, Ireland thus becoming the first invitational side to reach the semi-finals and then the podium of a World Rugby Sevens Series event. Invited to the following event in Paris, Ireland finished seventh, their second top half finish as an invitational side, and the first invitational side to do so.\nThe following year, Ireland again played in the 2019 Hong Kong Sevens qualifier. Ireland won the tournament, defeating Hong Kong 28–7 in the final, with Jordan Conroy’s 10 tries across six matches earning him Player of the Tournament. Ireland again appeared at the 2019 London Sevens and 2019 Paris Sevens, reaching the quarterfinals of the London Sevens.\nIreland joined the World Rugby Sevens Series as a \"core status\" team for the first time for the 2019–20 season. In their first tournament, the 2019 Dubai Sevens, Jordan Conroy led all scores with seven tries and was named to the tournament Dream Team. \nThe ten-tournament season was cut to six tournaments due to the global Covid-19 pandemic. Ireland reached the quarter-final round in three of the six tournaments during the season, finishing in 10th place. Wing Jordan Conroy led all try scorers in the competition with 30 tries, with centre Terry Kennedy finishing fifth with 17 tries. In May 2022, Ireland achieved their highest ever position at a World Series event, reaching the final of the Toulouse Sevens before falling 17–29 to Fiji. Ireland reached their second World Series final at the 2022 Dubai Sevens losing to South Africa in the final, 5–21.\nSeason by season.\n\"Updated as of 3 March 2024\" \n\"Results listed above do not include matches played as part of the Hong Kong World Series qualifier competition.\"\nSummer Olympics.\n2016 Olympics qualifying.\nIreland began Olympic qualifying by playing in Division C within Europe. \nIn the 6–7 June 2015 Division C tournament, Ireland went 6–0 in the competition to win Division C, winning all six matches by a comfortable margin. This win qualified them to participate in Division B.\nIn the 20–21 June, 2015 Division B tournament, Ireland again went 6–0 to win Division B, again winning all six matches by a comfortable margin. This win qualified them for the European repechage tournament.\nIn the 18–19 July 2015 Rugby Europe sevens repechage in Lisbon, Ireland topped their group with wins over Italy and Georgia and a draw against Russia. In the knockout competition, Ireland defeated Lithuania 17–0 in the quarterfinals. Ireland then lost in the semifinals to Russia 10–24, but in the third-place match defeated Georgia 15–7 to finish third overall, and secure the third and final European qualifying place for the Final 2016 Men's Olympic Qualification Tournament.\nThe Irish team drew Samoa, Tonga and Zimbabwe in the final Olympic repechage tournament in Monaco. Ireland finished first in their group with three wins, including a close 27–21 over World Series team Samoa. Ireland lost in the quarterfinals to Spain, 7–12, and did not qualify for the Olympics.\n2020 Olympics.\nIreland finished third at the 2019 Rugby Europe qualifying tournament. With this result, they did not automatically qualify for the 2020 Olympics, but gained a spot in the final inter-continental playoff tournament. They then won the playoff tournament to secure the last qualifying spot in the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nIreland opened their 2020 Olympic campaign with losses to both South Africa and the United States. Despite a five point victory over Kenya and a third place finish in their pool, Ireland failed to achieve a quarterfinal spot due to an unfavourable points difference. They subsequently defeated South Korea 31–0, before losing to Kenya, to finish in 10th place.\n2024 Olympics.\nIreland defeated Great Britain 26–12 in the final of the 2023 European Games, thereby qualifying for the 2024 Summer Olympics.\nRugby World Cup Sevens.\nIreland has played in six out of the seven Rugby World Cup Sevens tournaments. Ireland's best finish was the inaugural 1993 tournament. In that tournament, they went 4–1 in pool play, including an upset win over France, to qualify to the quarterfinal round. In the quarterfinal round of pool play they went 2–1 with wins over Samoa and Tonga to reach the semifinals. Ireland faced Australia in the semifinal and was leading but an Australia try and conversion at the end resulted in a 19–21 loss.\nSince the inaugural tournament, however, Ireland's performances have been comparatively unremarkable, as they have yet to secure another quarterfinal place. At the 1997 tournament, Ireland finished 19th, posting a 1–5 record which included losses to minnows Hong Kong and Japan, with its only win a 33–5 victory over Portugal in the Bowl quarterfinal. In 2001, Ireland finished fifth in its group of six, unable to notch wins against Russia or Korea, relegating it to the Bowl competition; they defeated Chinese Taipei in the Bowl quarterfinal but lost 12–33 to Portugal in the Bowl semifinal.\nIn 2005, Ireland fared slightly better, with its 2–3 record in group play qualifying it for the Plate competition, where they lost to Samoa 14–19 in the Plate quarterfinal. In 2009, Ireland was up-and-down in pool play, notching a surprise win against Australia, but a disappointing loss against Portugal. Ireland was one of three teams in a four-team group to finish with a 1–2 record in pool play, but Ireland was ranked last in the group on points difference and was relegated to the Bowl competition. There they posted a 2–1 record in knockout play, eventually losing to Zimbabwe in the Bowl final 17–14. Ireland did not qualify for the 2013 World Cup, failing to send a team to the 2012 Sevens Grand Prix qualifying tournaments.\nIreland had a better tournament in 2018, defeating core teams Kenya, Wales, and Australia en route to a ninth-place finish, their best finish since the inaugural 1993 tournament. \nIreland qualified for 2022 tournament, by going undefeated in their four matches at the 2022 Rugby World Cup Sevens European Qualifier in July 2022. At the tournament Ireland won four of their five matches including a 24–14 quarterfinal victory over hosts South Africa, on their way to a bronze medal finish.\nRugby Europe Sevens.\n\"Updated 9 July 2023\"\n2002−2014.\nAlthough Rugby Europe has held a rugby sevens championship every year since 2002, Ireland rarely participated from 2002 to 2014. Ireland participated only twice during those 13 years − in 2004 and 2008, both of which served as European regional qualifying tournaments for the following year's Rugby World Cup Sevens. Ireland finished third in the 2004 competition to qualify for the 2005 World Cup. Ireland finished fourth in the 2008 competition to qualify for the 2009 World Cup.\n2015−present.\nThe 2015 European competitions also doubled as qualifying for the 2016 Summer Olympics. Ireland played in the Division C tournament on 6–7 June and won the tournament with a 6–0 record, its closest match being the 38–10 quarterfinal win over Austria, qualifying for Division B. Ireland then played the Division B tournament on 20–21 June, and won Division B with a 6–0 record, its closest match being a 54–0 pool-play win over Slovenia, qualifying for the final repechage tournament.\nIreland played in the 2015 repechage on 18–19 July where they faced a tougher level of competition. Ireland went 2-1-0 in the repechage pool play to win its group and reach the knockout rounds. Ireland lost to Russia in the semifinals, 10–24, but defeated Georgia 15–7 to take third place and secure the last qualifying spot for the final cross-continental Olympic qualifying tournament. They lost in these quarterfinals to Spain and did not make the 2016 Summer Olympics medal round.\nThe 2016 Trophy competition consisted of two tournaments – Malmo and Prague. Ireland went 6–0 to win the 2016 Malmo tournament, with the closest match being the 26–12 semifinal win over Ukraine. Ireland next won the 2016 Prague tournament, again with a perfect 6–0 record, with the closest match being the 24–0 semifinal win over Romania. Ireland finished first in the 2016 Trophy competition and won promotion to the 2017 Grand Prix series.\nThe 2017 Grand Prix series consisted of four tournaments. Ireland began the Grand Prix by winning the 2017 Moscow Sevens with a 5–1 record, defeating Russia 28–21 in the semifinals and Spain 12–0 in the finals. Next, Ireland finished third in the 2017 Lodz Sevens with a 5–1 record, losing to Russia 19–26 in the semifinals.

The following week they claimed the 2022 Rugby Europe Sevens Trophy and sealed their promotion back to the Rugby Europe Championship by winning all six matches of the Budapest leg, defeating England in the final 35–14. Ireland won the first leg of the 2023 Championship tournament defeating Georgia in the Algarve final, 19–10.

        "text": "The Princess Taiping () was a replica of a Ming Dynasty Chinese junk built for a sailing trip from China to the United States and back. The ship sank approximately from its final destination on Saturday, 25 April 2009. If successful, it would have been the first ship of its kind known to have done so. (Fifty years earlier, a junk called \"Free China\" had been sailed to San Francisco but none had ever made the more difficult return journey to China.)\nHistory.\nThe ship was commissioned by 61-year-old Liu Ningsheng (\"Nelson Liu\"), possibly the first Taiwanese person to ever circle the earth in a yacht, to demonstrate the plausibility of the theory that the Chinese explored the American West Coast decades before the voyages of Christopher Columbus. The ship was a replica of war ships in the navies of Zheng He and Koxinga. It was long and wide. Thirty craftsmen from Fuzhou, Quanzhou and Zhangzhou spent six years building the ship, without nuts and bolts, using traditional Chinese shipbuilding techniques. It was entirely wind-powered, with three cotton sails.\nThe ship was launched in June, 2008 from Xiamen, in the People's Republic of China. It set off on June 26 from Keelung, Taiwan, with Liu as skipper. It made of its trip, stopping in California, Hawaii, and Japan, among other places, before it was rammed by the \"Champion Express\", a Liberian-flagged Norwegian chemical tanker, near the Su Ao Harbor in northeastern Taiwan, 20–30 miles from the end of its voyage back in Keelung. The \"Princess Taiping\" sank. Although the \"Champion Express\" did not stop to give assistance, Liu sent a distress signal by radio beacon. The skipper and all ten members of his international crew were rescued by a Taiwanese helicopter and rescue ship after several hours in the water.\nAt the time of the sinking, a similar replica of a Ming Dynasty vessel was under construction in Tainan. This replica named \"Taiwan Cheng Kung\" set sail from Anping Harbour on Saturday 4 December 2010 and travelled to the estuary of Luermen Creek in Taiwan."
