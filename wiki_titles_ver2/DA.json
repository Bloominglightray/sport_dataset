        "title": "1948 British Grand Prix",
        "text": "The Royal Automobile Club International Grand Prix was a motor race held on 2 October 1948, at Silverstone Airfield, Northamptonshire, UK. It is commonly cited as the first British Grand Prix of the modern era.\nHeld two years before the inauguration of the FIA World Championship of Drivers, the 65-lap race was run under the new Formula One regulations which effectively replaced the pre-war Grand Prix motor racing standards. Winner was the Italian Luigi Villoresi, in a Maserati 4CLT/48. A 13-lap 500 cc race, preceding the Grand Prix, was won by Spike Rhiando in a Cooper. Stirling Moss failed to finish after mechanical problems. \nThe race meeting marked the opening of the Silverstone Circuit, although at the time the site was only on a one-year loan to the RAC from the Air Ministry, having been a bomber station during World War II.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Automobile Club had previously run two International Grands Prix at the banked Brooklands circuit, in Surrey, in 1926 and 1927, and the Donington Park circuit had hosted four non-ranking Grands Prix between 1935 and 1939, but with the hiatus caused by the Second World War motorsport in Britain had lost ground to continental countries. Its two major race circuits were unusable, with Donington still littered with detritus from its wartime role as a supply depot, while the Brooklands circuit had been a major centre for aircraft development during the war and much of the track had been built over. With the abundance of redundant airfields in the years following the end of hostilities, however, there were plenty of potential venues for new race circuits. One such was at RAF Silverstone, a former bomber station.\nThe circuit.\nThe Royal Automobile Club took a one-year lease on the Silverstone airfield site in early 1948 and set about creating a race track. The airfield conformed to the standard model for WWII RAF sites: three long, wide runways formed a triangle, their ends joined by a narrow perimeter roadway. In this inaugural year the RAC decided to lay out a relatively long circuit, using the full lengths of the two longest runways, as well as large portions of the perimeter road.\nThe competitors started on the western perimeter road and headed north towards a right-hand turn, the high-speed \"Woodcote Corner\". From there the track used the northern edge of the perimeter to a sharp right turn onto the main runway at \"Copse Corner\". Then came the main runway, known for the race as \"Segrave Straight\", with the track continuing to the point at which the two largest runways intersected. Here, in an attempt to better emulate a true road circuit, the course designers narrowed the track with straw bales, which funnelled the cars into a 130° left hairpin bend onto the second runway. At the end of the second runway the cars rejoined the perimeter road, just before the old Becketts Corner, before continuing on the long straight road in front of the main aircraft hangar complex, known appropriately as \"Hangar Straight\".\nAt the end of the straight at what is now \"Stowe Corner\", competitors rejoined the main runway (this southern portion now named the \"Seaman Straight\"), and headed back towards the central hairpin complex. Once again, at the intersection of the two runways the track was narrowed, before a left-hand hairpin onto the second runway, heading back out to the perimeter road. The perimeter road was rejoined at \"Club Corner\". From this point the track once again headed north towards the finish line, passing through the flat-out \"Abbey Curve\" en route. Total track length was approximately 3.7 miles (5.9 km), substantially longer than the 2.9 miles (4.7 km) of Silverstone's classic layout, and longer even than the current 3.2-mile (5.1 km) circuit design. This was the only Grand Prix event ever held on this track layout, as from 1949 onward Silverstone circuits used only the perimeter roads. To commemorate the opening of this new circuit, all drivers completing either the Grand Prix or 500 cc race received the \"RAC Silverstone Plaque\". Despite the interim and improvised nature of the Silverstone site, the event attracted in excess of 100,000 spectators.\nGrand Prix entrants.\nThe entry list for the 65-lap Grand Prix was very mixed. Brand new, full works cars were entered by Maserati, Talbot-Lago and Ferrari, while the majority of the remaining field was made up of privateer entrants, mostly running pre-war cars. The organisers were particularly pleased to have attracted entries from leading continental firm Maserati; two of their brand new 4CLT/48 \"Sanremo\" models were entered: a works car for Luigi Villoresi, and one by British privateer Reg Parnell. A third 4CLT/48 was later entered for a second factory driver, Alberto Ascari, and a fourth as a reserve in the hands of local driver Leslie Brooke. Four Talbot-Lago T26C cars were also entered, including one for pre-war star driver Louis Chiron, and a fifth held in reserve, entered by Lord Selsdon. Although Scuderia Ferrari entered two of its Ferrari 125s, the team decided at the last minute to concentrate their efforts on mainland Europe and did not arrive.\nOf the older vehicles, two of the most notable were the Maserati 4CLs from the Scuderia Platé and White Mouse Stable teams. These cars were to be driven by Toulo de Graffenried and Prince Bira respectively, both previously winners of major races. The ERA marque, well represented among the local privateers, was bolstered by a factory entry from the firm's progenitor Raymond Mays. Another significant ERA entry was that of David Hampshire who drove R1A, the first ERA car to be constructed, dating from 1934. Leslie Johnson, owner of ERA in 1948, entered and drove one of the firm's 1939 E-type models. Although Peter Walker was also entered in an E-type, the car was unavailable on race day so he reverted to his own B-type, R10B.\nNotable by their absence were the Alfa Romeo works team, who decided not to attend with their dominant 158 \"Alfetta\" cars. One Alfa oddity was on show, however: the 1935 Bimotore, albeit with only one of its two engines in operation, was driven by Tony Rolt, an ex-Colditz prisoner of war and the future developer of four-wheel drive.\nEntry list.\n1 Late entry, assumed the running number of non-arrival Giuseppe Farina.\n&lt;br&gt;(r) Reserve entry.\nRAC 500 cc race.\nThe main Grand Prix event was supported by a race for 500 cc (later to become Formula 3) cars. It was dominated by privateer Cooper entries that included future Grand Prix star Stirling Moss and John Cooper himself, both driving the new MkII. Future four-time British Hill Climb Champion Ken Wharton was also in the running, driving his self-built 500 cc special, in a strong field of well over 30 cars.\nDespite the prestigious occasion – running two hours before the main Grand Prix event, the 500 cc race was actually the first ever competitive race on the Silverstone Circuit – the start was something of a shambles. When British Racing Drivers' Club President Lord Howe dropped the starting flag only two of the 34 drivers were ready to begin. Eric Brandon – an experienced 500 cc driver, and the first to win a 500 cc race in Britain – was not even seated in his car, but recovered to finish fifth. Moss had dominated the British 500 cc race season up to this point, but his car lost drive during the race and challenger Spike Rhiando won in his Cooper MkII. John Cooper was second, and the 58-year-old Baronet of Bodicote, Sir Francis Samuelson (also a Cooper MkII driver) took third.\nGrand Prix.\nQualifying.\nThe works Maserati 4CLTs were delayed on their way to Silverstone, and in their absence qualifying was dominated by Monegasque driver Chiron, in his Ecurie France-run Talbot-Lago. He took pole position with a time of 2:56.0, a second clear of de Graffenried's Maserati in second place. Third was the Talbot-Lago of Philippe Étancelin, a further second behind de Graffenried. Despite driving a car a decade older than those in front of him, Bob Gerard managed to put his ERA R14B into fourth position, only two-tenths of a second behind Étancelin, with Johnson's ERA E-type in fifth. Having missed official practice, the Maseratis of Villoresi and Ascari were forced to start at the back of the field, in 24th and 25th positions respectively, but in unofficial practice immediately before the race Ascari posted a lap of 2:54.6, over a second faster than Chiron's pole position time.\nRace.\nAt the start, de Graffenried got away from the line fastest, but he was passed by Chiron, Parnell and Johnson before the first corner at Woodcote. This group was followed by Bira, Étancelin and Gerard. As the leaders entered Woodcote Johnson drew level with the leader, Chiron, but at that moment the driveshaft on Johnson's ERA failed, causing its immediate retirement. Further back in the field, Salvadori went straight to his pit box from the start, to attend to an oiled spark plug. The stop cost him half a lap, and put him into last position. In the early corners Parnell was close behind Chiron, in second place, but his month-old Maserati dropped out on the first lap after a flying stone tore out the drain plug of his fuel tank.\nBy the end of the second lap the Maseratis of Villoresi and Ascari, showing their superior pace and benefiting from retirements, had made their way through the field and were close on Chiron's tail. On lap three both passed Chiron, and Villoresi took the lead. Later on the same lap Italian privateer Gianfranco Comotti joined the early retirees, when his Talbot's brakes failed. Another driver whose brakes fared badly was \"B. Bira\", who dropped back into the pack because of them, after having pressed the leaders in the opening few laps. Rolt's single-engined \"Bimotore\" Alfa Romeo lost the use of that remaining motor on lap 6, and Rolt was forced to retire. Geoffrey Ansell's ERA R9B rolled on lap 23, throwing Ansell out of the car. He was unscathed.\nAs the race progressed de Graffenried dropped yet further back, as his engine went out of tune and started to overheat, and he eventually finished six laps behind the winners. The other early leader, Chiron, started to suffer from a lack of performance in his Talbot on lap 17, and Bira slipped ahead of him into third place. Gerard sat in fifth place, after Étancelin's engine began to overheat, which dropped him back down the field as he was forced to make successive pit stops to top up his radiator fluid, and he eventually retired on lap 22. Chiron dropped even further back after spending 45 seconds in the pits investigating the poor handling of his Talbot, and he eventually retired with a seized gearbox on lap 37. Gerard passed Bira during refuelling pit stops, his pit crew completing the task four seconds faster than Bira's. However, Louis Rosier slipped past both of them as he did not need to stop for fuel. Gerard eventually caught Rosier again on lap 52, and passed him to take third place.\nThe works Maseratis were never more than a few seconds apart, and they regularly swapped the lead between them. On laps 27 and 29, respectively, Villoresi and Ascari came into the pits to refuel. During his stop, Ascari also replaced both rear wheels of his Maserati, and the extra time taken for this stop put him 50 seconds behind his team mate, but he retained second place. He lost a further 16 seconds to Villoresi during the second round of pit stops, putting him almost a full minute behind the leader at that point. However, Villoresi, who posted the fastest lap of the race (2:52.0), suffered an unusual mishap when his tachometer's fixings failed and the unit fell out of the Maserati's dashboard. In addition to not now knowing the speed of his engine, the tachometer lodged underneath Villoresi's clutch pedal and prevented him from using the clutch for the remainder of the race. Despite this, Villoresi managed to hold on to the lead and proved the eventual winner, 14 seconds ahead of Ascari and half a lap ahead of Gerard. The only other finisher on the same lap as the leaders, but only a few seconds from being lapped, was Rosier's Talbot-Lago."

        "title": "2008 Monaco Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2008 Monaco Grand Prix (formally the Formula 1 Grand Prix de Monaco 2008) was a Formula One motor race held on 25 May 2008 at the Circuit de Monaco; contested over 76 laps, it was the sixth race of the 2008 Formula One World Championship. The race was won by the season's eventual Drivers' Champion, Lewis Hamilton, for the McLaren team. BMW Sauber driver Robert Kubica finished second, and Felipe Massa, who started from pole position, was third in a Ferrari.\nConditions were wet at the start of the race. Massa maintained his lead into the first corner, but his teammate Kimi Räikkönen was passed for second by Hamilton, who had started in third position on the grid. Hamilton suffered a punctured tyre on lap six, forcing him to make a pit stop from which he re-entered the race in fifth place. As the track dried and his rivals made their own pit stops Hamilton became the race leader, a position he held until the end of the race. Kubica's strategy allowed him to pass Massa during their second pit stops, after the latter's Ferrari was forced to change from wet to dry tyres. Räikkönen dropped back from fifth position to ninth after colliding with Adrian Sutil's Force India late in the race. Sutil had started from 18th on the grid and was in fourth position before the incident, which allowed Red Bull driver Mark Webber to finish fourth, ahead of Toro Rosso driver Sebastian Vettel in fifth.\nThe race was Hamilton's second win of the season, his first in Monaco, and the result meant that he led the Drivers' Championship, three points ahead of Räikkönen and four ahead of Massa. Ferrari maintained their lead in the Constructors' Championship, 16 points ahead of McLaren and 17 ahead of BMW Sauber, with 12 races of the season remaining.\nBackground.\nThe Grand Prix was contested by 20 drivers, in ten teams of two. The teams, also known as \"constructors\", were Ferrari, McLaren-Mercedes, Renault, Honda, Force India-Ferrari, BMW Sauber, Toyota, Red Bull-Renault, Williams-Toyota and Toro Rosso-Ferrari. Tyre supplier Bridgestone brought four different tyre types to the race: two dry-weather tyre compounds, the softer marked by a single white stripe down one of the grooves, and two wet-weather compounds, the extreme wet also marked by a single white stripe.\nBefore the race, Ferrari driver Kimi Räikkönen led the Drivers' Championship with 35 points, and his teammate Felipe Massa was second with 28 points. McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton was third, also on 28 points, with one win fewer than Massa; BMW driver Robert Kubica was fourth on 24 points, ahead of his teammate Nick Heidfeld on 20 points. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari were leading with 63 points, 19 points ahead of BMW Sauber, and 21 points ahead of McLaren-Mercedes.\nFerrari had responded to Hamilton's win in the opening round of the season in Australia by winning each of the subsequent four races, giving them a commanding lead in the Constructors' Championship. Ferrari's dominance had been highlighted by two one-two finishes: Massa ahead of Räikkönen in Bahrain and Räikkönen's win over Massa at the following round in Spain. A strong drive despite an unfavourable strategy had helped Hamilton to split the Ferrari drivers on the podium in Turkey, coming second, behind Massa but ahead of Räikkönen. Ferrari had not won in Monaco since 2001, and had been unable to match McLaren's pace in 2007. After tests at the Circuit Paul Ricard in mid-May, Räikkönen said his team had developed a strong car for the tight, low-speed Monaco circuit, but they still expected a challenge from McLaren and BMW Sauber. Hamilton claimed that McLaren would be competitive at Monaco, but Kubica played down his team's chances, saying \"I think a win will be very difficult.\"\nToro Rosso's main 2008 car, the STR3, was also introduced that weekend; the team had used a modified version of their 2007 car, the STR2, for the opening five races. Originally due to be introduced at the previous race in Turkey, a crash in testing had left the team short of spare parts, delaying the car's race debut. As the STR3 used a different transmission than that used in the STR2, Toro Rosso driver Sebastian Vettel was forced to take a five-place penalty on the grid for an unscheduled change of gearbox. His teammate Sébastien Bourdais escaped a similar penalty because he had failed to finish the race in Turkey, allowing him a free gearbox change.\nPractice.\nThree practice sessions were held before the Sunday race – two on Thursday, and one on Saturday. The Thursday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted 90 minutes; the third session, on Saturday morning, lasted for an hour. One hour into the first session, officials noticed a loose drain cover in the run through Beau Rivage, and suspended practice. Ferrari and McLaren took the top four spots after the resumption – Räikkönen ahead of Hamilton, McLaren driver Heikki Kovalainen, and Massa. Behind Williams driver Nico Rosberg, Kubica was the best of the BMW Saubers in sixth; his teammate Heidfeld was forced to retire because of an engine failure, and stopped his car in Casino Square after just 13 laps. Despite further delays during the second session – both Renault drivers crashed in separate incidents at Sainte Devote, requiring the marshals to sweep the track of debris – Hamilton again proved strong, fastest ahead of Rosberg, Räikkönen, Massa, Kovalainen and Kubica. Apart from the Renault drivers, two more cars struck the barriers: Toyota driver Jarno Trulli scraped the wall out of Piscine; Adrian Sutil's Force India lost its front wing after tagging the barrier at Rascasse. While light rain fell on Saturday morning, Kovalainen set the fastest time in the final session, before losing control at Piscine and damaging the rear of his car. The rain increased as the marshals cleared the debris, and in the ensuing poor track conditions Kovalainen's time remained unbeaten. Hamilton managed second fastest, ahead of Räikkönen, Rosberg, Kubica and Massa.\nQualifying.\nSaturday afternoon's qualifying session was divided into three parts. In the first 20-minute period, cars finishing 16th or lower were eliminated. The second qualifying period lasted for 15 minutes, at the end of which the fastest ten cars went into the final period, to determine their grid positions for the race. Cars failing to make the final period were allowed to be refuelled before the race but those competing in it were not, and so carried more fuel than they had done in the earlier qualifying sessions.\nMassa clinched his third pole position of the season with a time of 1:15.787, and was joined on the front row by teammate Räikkönen. Hamilton took third place on the grid, with a qualifying time just 0.052 seconds slower than Massa's. Kovalainen edged out Kubica to take fourth, the latter struggling to get heat into his tyres for his final run. Rosberg's attacking style took him to sixth; Renault driver Fernando Alonso, Trulli and Red Bull driver Mark Webber occupied the next three places. Webber's teammate David Coulthard ended his second session in the barriers after the tunnel, after his car jerked sideways at the crest under braking. Although Coulthard was unhurt, the position of his stricken car and the subsequent caution flags surrounding it denied many drivers the opportunity to make their final flying laps in the session. Honda driver Jenson Button, who took 12th behind Timo Glock of Toyota, blamed the disruption for his performance, having prepared his car specifically for the final run. Heidfeld suffered from similar tyre problems to his teammate and managed 13th; Williams driver Kazuki Nakajima and Honda driver Rubens Barrichello took the next two places ahead of Bourdais in the new STR3. Renault driver Nelson Piquet Jr. lined up from 17th and Vettel managed 18th before his gearbox penalty demoted him to 19th. The Force Indias of Sutil and Giancarlo Fisichella qualified slowest; Fisichella's penalty for a change of gearbox after morning practice meant he started from 20th on the grid.\nRace.\nOn Sunday morning Coulthard became the third driver to incur a gearbox penalty, after changing his transmission following his crash during qualifying. The penalty moved him from 10th to 15th on the grid. In contrast to Saturday's dry qualifying session, frequent showers soaked the track on Sunday morning, making racing slippery and potentially hazardous. Although the showers subsided by early afternoon, they resumed 20 minutes before the start, the changeable conditions forcing teams to delay tyre choices for as long as possible. By the time of the three-minute warning most drivers had opted for the standard wet tyre; only Piquet started the race on the extreme wet. Kovalainen's engine stalled as the cars set off on their formation lap; his car was pushed back to the pit lane by his mechanics, where it was restarted and a new steering wheel fitted to solve the problem.\nMassa held his lead into the first corner at Sainte Devote, while behind him Hamilton used the pit lane exit to pass Räikkönen down the inside. Kovalainen's vacated fourth position was filled by Kubica, as Alonso moved into fifth, passing Rosberg. The latter made a pit stop soon after for a new front wing after making contact with Alonso at the hairpin, promoting Trulli to sixth. These positions were maintained for several laps, but the distances between the cars increased, in part because the spray thrown up by their wheels made close racing difficult. The conditions proved to be crucial when Hamilton made contact with barriers on the outside of Tabac on lap six, necessitating his return to the pit lane for a new set of tyres. The McLaren mechanics fuelled the car for a longer second stint and Hamilton emerged in fifth, the distances between his competitors' cars resulting in him losing only three places during the pit stop. Alonso had a similar accident to Hamilton's at Massenet two laps later, and emerged in seventh after pitting and taking on extreme wets.\nMassa's lead – 12 seconds over the second-placed Räikkönen by lap six – was reduced to nothing when the safety car was deployed on the eighth lap. Coulthard and Bourdais had crashed into the barriers at Massenet just seconds apart, requiring the marshals to separate the cars and lift them off the track. When the safety car pulled off after three laps, Massa consolidated his lead over his teammate. Räikkönen, however, was called into the pit lane for a drive-through penalty after to failing to have his tyres attached by the three-minute warning before the race, dropping him back to fourth. Kubica, now second, took the lead when Massa slid off down the escape road at Sainte Devote, the undamaged Ferrari rejoining in second as the rain eased. The two swapped positions again after their pit stops – Kubica on lap 26 and Massa on lap 33 – but Hamilton, carrying more fuel than his rivals, took the lead.\nAs a dry line appeared on the track, Hamilton extended his lead over Massa, from 13 to 37 seconds, by the time he made a pit stop for the second time on lap 54. His timing proved fortunate, as he changed to dry tyres just as such a strategy emerged as the strongest, and he emerged 13 seconds ahead of Massa. The Ferrari's own pit stop two laps later dropped Massa behind Kubica. Hamilton's lead was reduced when the safety car once again deployed on lap 62 after Rosberg crashed at Piscine, hitting both sides of the track and scattering debris. Rosberg was unhurt.\nOf the 20 cars which started the race, Sutil had gained the most places by the second safety car period. The Force India started from 18th, rose one place after Kovalainen was pushed back to the pit lane, passed Piquet on the second lap and Bourdais a lap later. Sutil benefited as Button, Rosberg, Glock and Trulli made pit stops for repairs over the following laps, to sit in 11th by lap 14. Alonso, on extreme wet tyres behind Heidfeld, attempted to pass the BMW at the hairpin, but succeeded only in damaging his front wing and forming a stationary queue behind him. He also benefitted by overtaking three cars under yellow flags and would have been penalised if he had finished the race. Sutil took advantage of the situation and passed four cars to take seventh, behind Heidfeld and Webber. Running a long first stint until lap 53, he moved to fourth as the cars ahead of him made pit stops. Vettel gained 12 places from the start, battling with Barrichello and Nakajima early on before jumping several places on his first stint as his rivals made pit stops, eventually switching to dry tyres when he stopped on lap 52. Webber improved three places from the start to sit in sixth, ahead of Vettel, Barrichello and Nakajima.\nThe safety car was withdrawn on lap 68. Later on the same lap, Räikkönen lost control of his car under braking out of the tunnel, and by the time he regained control his speed was too great to avoid a collision with Sutil. The Ferrari damaged its front wing and made a pit stops for a replacement before resuming, but the damage to Sutil's rear suspension led to his retirement. Webber benefited from the incident and moved to fourth place, while Räikkönen dropped back to ninth.\nThe slow pace during the opening laps meant the race ended after two hours, or 76 laps, rather than the 78 laps originally scheduled. Hamilton, despite suffering a slow puncture on the final lap, crossed the finish line to take his first win in Monaco. Kubica followed in second, ahead of Massa and Webber. Vettel took the STR3 to its first points in its maiden race, coming fifth, ahead of Barrichello and Nakajima. Kovalainen recovered from his stall to finish eighth, one place ahead of Räikkönen, who set the fastest lap of the race on lap 74, a 1:16.689. He was followed by Alonso, Button, Glock and Trulli. Heidfeld was the last of the classified finishers, in 14th position, four laps behind Hamilton. Fisichella retired with a gearbox failure after 36 laps; Piquet – two laps after he switched to dry tyres on lap 46 – finished his race in the barriers at Sainte Devote. Sutil, Rosberg, Coulthard and Bourdais were the four other retirements.\nPost-race.\nThe top three finishers appeared in Prince Albert II of Monaco's Royal box to collect their trophies. In the subsequent press conference Hamilton said that conditions early in the race made driving difficult: \"When the weather is like this, when it starts to rain and we had an idea it was going to start to dry, the important thing is to keep it on the track but I can't explain how difficult it was for all of us. You were aquaplaning all the time and you were tip-toeing almost.\" Hamilton also said that his crash at Tabac had been the result of a stream of water running over the track, causing his car to oversteer and resulting in a puncture to his right rear tyre. Nevertheless, he praised his team and strategy for helping him take the victory. Kubica said that tyre problems in his middle stint meant he was unable to overtake Massa, who was driving a heavier car. Noticing Glock's success on dry tyres, Kubica asked his team to make a similar change, resulting in his pass on Massa. During the post-race interview Massa said that although he was fuelled to the end of the race after his first pit stop, the drying track forced him to pit again for new tyres: \"It was a shame that we made a little mistake on the strategy but it is good to be on the podium.\"\nSutil expressed his disappointment after being knocked out of the race when he was on course to record his team's first points:\nRäikkönen apologised to Sutil for their collision, blaming cold brakes for his loss of control. Mike Gascoyne, Force India's technical chief, called for the stewards to investigate the incident, but after deliberation no action was taken. \"The frustration is that if that was a Force India driver hitting a world champion we'd expect to get a one or two-race ban, but the other way round nothing ever seems to happen\" said Gascoyne. Sutil was called to the stewards' room and reprimanded for passing three cars under yellow flags on lap 13. Because he had retired, he was issued with merely a warning, but had he finished the race he would have been given a 25-second time penalty, which would have dropped him out of the point-scoring positions.\nHamilton's win was praised by Jackie Stewart, a three-time winner of the Monaco Grand Prix. \"At his age, Lewis can win this race many times,\" he said. \"This is the first, I hope, of many victories for him in Monaco so that he can join the greats of Formula One.\" Damon Hill, the 1996 World Champion, said Hamilton \"did very well indeed. I was most impressed, and the race as a whole was also a great advertisement for what F1 should be about.\" As of 2023 this was McLaren's most recent victory at this Grand Prix. The race result left Hamilton leading the Drivers' Championship with 38 points. Räikkönen, who failed to score in Monaco, was second on 35 points, one point ahead of Massa and three ahead of Kubica. Heidfeld was sixth on 20 points. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari maintained their lead with 69 points, McLaren jumped to second on 53 points, and BMW Sauber dropped to third on 52 points, with 12 races of the season remaining."

The team played from 1959 until 1973, when the Eastern League folded.\nIn 1961, the President of the franchise, William H. Linck, held a contest among fans to name the team. The winner was the first entry received, from George Resch of Cambria Heights, Queens, who named the team \"Ducks\". Aside from naming rights, Resch received two season tickets for winning the contest.\nThe Ducks are most famously known for player-head coach John Brophy, who is believed to be the role model for Paul Newman's character of Reggie Dunlop in the movie \"Slap Shot\". Brophy encouraged and epitomized \"old-time hockey\" and brash physical play, retired as the league's career leader in penalty minutes, and was once suspended for half of a season for knocking down a referee. Brophy was quoted as saying, \"Once you're a Duck, you're a Duck for the rest of your life,\" as Ducks General Manager John Muckler traded Brophy six times and got him back seven times.\nThe Ducks won the Eastern Hockey League North Division in 1964–65 and 1965–66. They were the Eastern Hockey League playoff champions and won the Walker Cup Trophy on April 7, 1965.\nThe New York Islanders of the National Hockey League, who began play in 1972–73, had originally been widely expected to adopt the Long Island Ducks name.

The final was won by Italian club Inter Milan, who beat German side Bayern Munich 2–0.\nInter Milan went on to represent Europe in the 2010 FIFA Club World Cup, beating Congolese side TP Mazembe 3–0 in the final, and played in the 2010 UEFA Super Cup against Europa League winners Atlético Madrid, losing 2–0.\nBarcelona were the defending champions, but they were eliminated by eventual winners Inter Milan in the semi-finals.\nAssociation team allocation.\nA total of 76 teams participated in the 2009–10 Champions League, from 52 UEFA associations (Liechtenstein organises no domestic league competition). Associations were allocated places according to their 2008 UEFA country coefficient, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2003–04 to 2007–08.\nBelow is the qualification scheme for the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League:\nDistribution.\nSince the winners of the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League, Barcelona, obtained a place in the group stage through their domestic league placing, the reserved title holder spot in the group stage was effectively vacated. To compensate:\nTeams.\nLeague positions of the previous season shown in parentheses.\nTH Title Holder\nRound and draw dates.\nAll draws held at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland unless stated otherwise.\nQualifying rounds.\nIn a new system for the Champions League, there were two separate qualifying tournaments. The Champions Path (which started from the first qualifying round) was for clubs which won their domestic league and did not automatically qualify for the group stage, while the Non-Champions Path (which started from the third qualifying round) was for clubs which did not win their domestic league and did not automatically qualify for the group stage.\nIn the qualifying phase and the play-off round, teams played against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis.\nThe draw for the first and second qualifying rounds, conducted by UEFA President Michel Platini and UEFA General Secretary David Taylor, was held on 22 June 2009, and the draw for the third qualifying round, conducted by UEFA Competitions Director Giorgio Marchetti and Head of Club Competitions Michael Heselschwerdt, was held on 17 July 2009. For the draws, clubs were separated into seeded and unseeded teams based on their club coefficient. Because the draws for the second and third qualifying rounds took place before the previous round was completed, the teams were seeded assuming the seeded side in the previous round would be victorious.\nFirst qualifying round.\nThe first legs were played on 30 June and 1 July, and the second legs were played on 7 and 8 July 2009.\nSecond qualifying round.\nThe first legs were played on 14 and 15 July, and the second legs were played on 21 and 22 July 2009.\nPartizan's 8–0 win over Rhyl in the second leg equalled the record for the largest margin of victory in the current Champions League format.\n, the second leg between Stabæk and Tirana was under investigation by UEFA and German authorities for possible match-fixing.\nThird qualifying round.\nThe third qualifying round was split into two separate sections: one for champions and one for non-champions. The first legs were played on 28 and 29 July, and the second legs were played on 4 and 5 August 2009. The losing teams in both sections entered the play-off round of the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League.\nPlay-off round.\nAn extra qualifying round, the play-off round, was introduced from this season. The teams were split into two separate sections: one for champions and one for non-champions. The draw for the play-off round, conducted by UEFA General Secretary David Taylor and UEFA Competitions Director Giorgio Marchetti, was held on 7 August 2009. For the draw, clubs were separated into seeded and unseeded teams based on their club coefficient. The first legs were played on 18 and 19 August, and the second legs were played on 25 and 26 August 2009. The losing teams in both sections entered the group stage of the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League.\nGroup stage.\nThe draw for the group stage was held at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco on 27 August 2009. A total of 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four. Teams were divided into four pots, based on their club coefficient. Clubs from the same pot or the same association cannot be drawn into the same group.\nIn each group, teams played against each other home-and-away. The matchdays were 15–16 September, 29–30 September, 20–21 October, 3–4 November, 24–25 November, and 8–9 December 2009. The top two in each group advanced to the knockout phase, and the third-placed teams entered the round of 32 of the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League.\nBased on Article 7.06 in the UEFA regulations, if two or more teams were equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria were applied to determine the rankings:\nAZ, VfL Wolfsburg, Standard Liège, Zürich, APOEL, Rubin Kazan, Unirea Urziceni and Debrecen all made their debuts in the group stage.\nKnockout phase.\nIn the knockout phase, teams played against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final.\nThe draw for the round of 16 was held on 18 December 2009, conducted by UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino and Giorgio Marchetti, the UEFA Director of Competitions. The eight group winners, which played the second leg at home, were drawn against the eight group runners-up, with the restriction that teams from the same group or the same association could not be drawn with each other.\nThe draws for the quarter-finals, semi-finals, and final (to determine the \"home\" team) were held on 19 March 2010, conducted by Gianni Infantino and Emilio Butragueño, the ambassador for the final in Madrid. From the quarter-finals onwards, there were no seedings, and teams from the same group or the same association could be drawn with each other.\nRound of 16.\nStarting from this season, the matches in the round of 16 were held over four weeks, instead of the previous two weeks. The first legs were played on 16, 17, 23 and 24 February, and the second legs were played on 9, 10, 16 and 17 March 2010.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe first legs were played on 30 and 31 March, and the second legs were played on 6 and 7 April 2010.\nSemi-finals.\nThe first legs were played on 20 and 21 April, and the second legs were played on 27 and 28 April 2010.\nFinal.\nThe final of the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League was played at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid on 22 May 2010, between Germany's Bayern Munich and Italy's Inter Milan. The stadium, home of Real Madrid, had hosted three previous European Cup finals, in 1957, 1969 and 1980. It was the first time that a UEFA Champions League final was played on a Saturday night. England's Howard Webb was appointed to referee the final. The two clubs competing in the Final had each won their domestic league and cup competitions, meaning that the winner would become only the sixth club in Europe to have achieved a continental treble, and the first such club from their respective countries. It was also the second consecutive treble, following that of Barcelona in the previous season.\nStatistics.\nStatistics exclude qualifying rounds and play-off round."

        "text": "Charles Gilbert Taylor (April 18, 1942 – June 5, 2018) was an American professional baseball player who played in the Major League Baseball as a relief pitcher from 1969 to 1976 for the St. Louis Cardinals, New York Mets, Milwaukee Brewers and Montreal Expos.\nEarly life.\nBefore being signed by the Cardinals in 1961, Taylor attended Bell Buckle High School and then Middle Tennessee State University.\nBaseball career.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nTaylor spent three years (1961 to 1963) in the St. Louis Cardinals minor league system before being traded on February 17, 1964 to the Houston Colt .45s with first baseman/outfielder Jim Beauchamp for outfielder Carl Warwick.\nHe spent only one full season in the Colt '45s/Astros farm system—1964. Midway through the 1965 season, he was traded back to the Cardinals, this time with pitcher and former All-Star Hal Woodeshick for pitcher and future All-Star Mike Cuellar and pitcher Ron Taylor.\nUp until 1968, Taylor had respectable, but not outstanding, statistics in the minors, having been used both as a starter and reliever, and although he had a very good season with the Arkansas Travelers in 1966—posting a 1.31 ERA in 30 games—his success was countered that season with some bad outings with the Tulsa Oilers, where he had an ERA of 6.48 in 21 games.\n1968 was perhaps the best season of his entire professional career. As a starter, he appeared in 34 games for the Oilers, allowing only 202 hits in 230 innings, walking just 38 batters, and posting a record of 18 and 7 with a very respectable 2.35 ERA. At 26 years of age, he was fairly old prospect-wise, but still managed to impress the St. Louis Cardinals enough to put him on their roster for 1969.\nOn May 27, 1969, Taylor made his big league debut with the Cardinals, appearing in relief of pitcher Ray Washburn, and it was ultimately Taylor who gave up the winning run to the opposing team, the Atlanta Braves. \nTaylor was used both as a reliever and starter in his debut season, appearing in 27 games total, starting 13 of them, and posting a 7–5 won–loss record. His ERA was exactly a point below the league average: 2.56.\nNew York Mets.\nTaylor's next two seasons, 1970 and 1971, proved to be successful as well. Both years, he was used almost entirely as a reliever, posting ERAs of 3.11 and 3.53, respectively. \nHe was traded with Jim Beauchamp, Harry Parker and Chip Coulter to the Mets for Art Shamsky, Jim Bibby, Rich Folkers and Charlie Hudson on October 18, 1971.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\n1972 was not a very successful year for Taylor. In fact, he ended up spending a large portion of it in the minors, where he posted a 4.70 ERA in 26 games. In the Majors that year, Taylor had a 5.52 ERA with the Mets before being selected off waivers by the Brewers in September. In 11 innings with the Brewers that year, he posted a 1.54 ERA, bringing his season ERA down to 4.43.\nMontreal Expos.\nIn March 1973, Taylor was released by the Brewers and signed by the Montreal Expos a couple of weeks later. In his first year with the Expos, he posted a 1.77 ERA, but appeared in only eight games, where that performance, however, was something of a foreshadowing of what would happen in the year to come.\n1974 was the best season of his Major League career. He appeared in relief 61 times, posting a 2.17 ERA in 107 innings. He ranked ninth in the league in game appearances, fifth in the league in saves with 11 and sixth in the league in games finished with 39.\nThe next two seasons, 1975 and 1976, were not as successful as he posted ERAs of 3.53 and 4.50 respectively. He wrapped up his career in 1976, playing in his final big league game on October 3.\nOverall, for his career, Taylor went 28–20 with a 3.07 ERA in 305 big league appearances. Of the 21 games he started, he completed six of them (five of them in one season, 1969) and shut out two. In exactly 607 innings of work, Taylor walked 162 batters and struck out 282. Only twice did his season ERA measure greater than the overall league ERA—in 1972 and 1976.\nAt the plate, Taylor hit .158 in 101 at-bats, collecting 16 hits. Of those 16 hits, four were doubles and one was a triple. He struck out 34 times and walked only three times.\nIn the field, he committed two errors in 135 total chances for a .985 fielding percentage."

        "text": "Carmel &amp; District Cricket Club is a cricket team based in Flintshire North Wales. They play competitive cricket in the North Wales Cricket League. They are the only Welsh village team to have defeated an international cricket team, and staged matches between national teams at their Pen-y-Gelli ground.\nHistory.\nCarmel was founded as the result of a public meeting for those interested in the formation of a cricket club in September 1965. The main people behind the meeting were Norman Cross-Parry, Meirion Griffith and Bill Parker.\nThe club initially played at Golch ground in the village of Carmel between Lloc and Holywell.\nThe club's first match took place against a now defunct team made of workers from BJ Construction. The inaugural season also saw matches against Abergele, St Asaph and Northop Hall.\nEventually the Golch site was sold and the club successfully applied to the Sports Council and Delyn Borough Council for grant-aid to re-establish the club on another ground.\nA site with good quality soil for a cricket square was found. Carmel began their first season at their new Pen-y-Gelli ground in 1991 and Conwy CC provided the opponents in the inaugural match. Backed by club secretary Stan Taylor, Carmel continued to develop their facilities and in July 1998 former England cricket international Tom Cartwright and Mrs Dorothy Taylor opened the new pavilion.\nCarmel forayed into international cricket beginning with the Iron Curtain Cricket Tour in 2007 under the captaincy of Timothy Abraham. The touring side played Estonia in Tallinn and Latvia in Riga. Carmel defeated Estonia in the final of the Helsinki Sixes tournament in Finland, but lost twice in longer matches against the team.\nA match against Russia in the Russian National Baseball Stadium in Moscow that became the tour highlight when they became the first touring side to ever visit the city.\nIn June 2008 the Carmel Touring XI again went overseas for the 'Ottoman Empire Tour' where they defeated Romania in Bucharest and Bulgaria in Sofia. Carmel represented 'Wales' in the Vienna World Cup Sixes competition where they were beaten in the semi-finals by an Austro-Pakistani team.\nJuly 2008 saw Carmel stage their biggest project yet with the establishing of an eight-team European Twenty20 Championship tournament that featured Estonia and Russia. Also involved were the national teams of Slovakia, Croatia, Czech Republic and Poland as well as a Cricket Board of Wales representative side.\nThe tournament, which was supported by the International Cricket Council, was won by Estonia who beat Czech Republic in a dramatic last-over victory. Carmel staged the European Twenty20 tournament again in July 2009 and the national cricket teams of Croatia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Russia as well as the Island of Alderney were among those to take part. The tournament was won by a team that represented the Flanders region after they defeated hosts Carmel in a low-scoring final. Croatia won the 'plate' competition after they defeated English club side New Victoria who had replaced Estonia after they pulled out of the event. In the week preceding the EuroTwenty20 Carmel faced prestigious touring side Crusaders Australia led by Swan Richards.\nCarmel's Touring XI undertook their most ambitious tour in May and June 2009 where they played in six countries in 11 days. After victory at the Lille Twenty20 tournament in France the team recorded victories over Slovakia in Hajske and over Hungary in Budapest.\nOne of the biggest honours for the club's touring side came later in the trip when they played the first ever international cricket match in Serbia where they ran out winners in a 40-over contest against a Belgrade Cricket Association XI. Carmel subsequently played the first international match in Macedonia when they took on a Macedonian XI in Skopje. The first of two Twenty20 clashes between the two sides was broadcast live in its entirety on national television station Sky Net.\nCarmel's Touring XI toured Austria, Slovenia, and Croatia in 2010, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia in 2012, Romania and Switzerland in 2013. In 2014 they played the first ever game of cricket in Montenegro against Porto Montenegro Cricket Club as well as returning to Austria, Slovenia and Austria.\nOn 8 October 2009 the club lost Peter Ferguson, who died from cancer. Ferguson made 1,169 appearances, scoring 12,000 runs and 1,443 wickets.\nIn January 2010 the club staged an international 'Snow cricket' match at the club's Pen-y-Gelli between the club's English and Welsh players. The match ended in a tie. The club was the first team in the North Wales Cricket League to embrace social networking sites Facebook and Twitter\nCarmel's First XI captain for the 2015 season is Barry Mcgauty, Second XI skipper is Christopher Jones and Third XI captain is Nick Hughes."

He played nine years in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers (1976–1980), Texas Rangers (1981–1983), and Oakland Athletics (1984).\nEarly years.\nWagner was born in 1954 in Conneaut, Ohio. He attended Harbor High School in Ashtabula, Ohio.\nProfessional baseball.\nMinor leagues.\nHe was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 1972 amateur draft. He played several years in the minor leagues for the Bristol Tigers in 1972, the Clinton Pilots in 1973, the Lakeland Tigers in 1974, the Clinton Pilots in 1975, and the Evansville Triplets in 1976 and 1977. He won MVP honors at Clinton in 1973.\nWagner was called up by the Tigers in August 1976 after Tom Veryzer sustained an ankle injury. Tagged as a \"good field, no hit\" player, Wagner impressed in his first week with the club, with hits in first two at bats, impressive defensive performance, and a game-winning run batted in off Goose Gossage. He appeared in 39 games with a .261 batting average.\nIn 1977, Wagner competed with Tom Veryzer for the starting shortstop position with the Tigers. Wagner appeared in only 22 games for the 1977 Tigers, tallying only seven hits in 48 at bats for a .146 batting average. He was sent back to Evansville, where he compiled career-highs in batting average (.306) and on-base percentage (.377) in 64 games.\nDetroit Tigers.\nDuring the spring of 1978, Wagner was again in competition for the starting shortstop job, this time with rookie Alan Trammell. Wagner appeared in 39 games during the 1978 season, including 27 as the starter at shortstop, and compiled a .239 batting average. Trammell won the competition and went on to a Hall of Fame career over the next 20 years.\nIn 1979, Wagner appeared in 75 games, including 22 starts at shortstop and 22 starts at second base. His batting average improved to .274 with a .341 on-base percentage urign the 1979. He never came close to those marks in the balance of his career. He appeared in 45 games for the Tigers in 1980, but his batting average dropped by 38 points to .236.\nTexas Rangers.\nIn December 1980, the Tigers traded Wagner to the Texas Rangers in exchange for relief pitcher Kevin Saucier. He spent the 1981 season as the Rangers' backup shortstop, appearing in 50 games and compiling a .254 batting average.\nDuring 1982 spring training, Wagner beat out Mario Mendoza and began the season as the Rangers' starting shortstop. In April 1982, Steve Pate of the \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\" wrote that Wagner was \"playing some of the best shortstop in the history of the organization.\" On May 17, 1982, he was stretching prior to a game when he was hit on the back of the head by a baseball thrown by Chicago White Sox Jerry Koosman. The blow resulted in dizzy spells, nausea, and balance problems and was limited to one at bat over the next two weeks. Other injuries followed, including a bout of prostatitis. On July 9, his season ended as the result of and a pulled intestinal muscle.\nWagner reported to the team in 1983, but Bucky Dent won the starting shortstop job, and Texas manager Doug Rader declined to play him even as a backup. In March, Rader said, Maybe he's doing the best he can, but I've got to go by what I see. It doesn't look like he's running on all eight cylinders.\" As of late May, Wagner had not received a single moment of playing time. Wagner said he wanted to play, but Rader said \"the situation hasn't come up where he would feel comfortable using Wagner.\"\nOakland A's.\nIn November 1983, Wagner was not selected in the free agent re-entry draft. In April 1985, he signed as a free agent with the Oakland Athletics. He appeared in 82 games, including 19 games as the team's starting shortstop and seven as the starting third baseman. On August 20, 1984, he pitched the final 1 innings against the Detroit Tigers, giving up two hits and no runs in a 14–1 loss. He compiled a .230 batting average for Oakland and appeared in his final major league game at age 30 on September 30, 1984.\nOver nine seasons in Major League Baseball, Wagner played in 414 games and had a .243 batting average, 205 hits, 81 runs scored, 71 runs batted in, 61 walks, 20 doubles, nine triples and three home runs. Defensively, he appeared in 408 games (327 at shortstop) and tallied 469 putouts, 852 assists, 154 double plays, 61 errors, and a .956 fielding percentage.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

        "text": "The Over-the-Hill Gang was the George Allen-coached Washington Redskins team of the early 1970s, so named due to the large number of veteran players on the team. Many of those players also played for Allen when he coached the Los Angeles Rams from 1966 to 1970.\nThe start of the Over-the-Hill Gang was the 1971 NFL Draft. Of the Redskins first five picks that year, they only used one, deciding to trade the rest. Allen had decided to build his team with experienced players who \"did not have to mold to the NFL game\". One of these trades was for Billy Kilmer, a quarterback who had been playing for the New Orleans Saints. As a starter for the Redskins, Kilmer threw for 3,869 yards and 32 touchdown passes. More importantly, he led the Redskins to back-to-back playoff appearances and became the first Redskins quarterback to start a Super Bowl.\nThis, however, was not the most important event in the '71 Draft that led to the creation of the gang. Allen later dealt seven draft choices (including the first- and third-round picks in 1971) as well as linebacker Marlin McKeever to his former team, the Rams. In exchange, the Redskins received linebackers Jack Pardee, Myron Pottios and Maxie Baughan, defensive tackle Diron Talbert, guard John Wilbur and special teams player Jeff Jordan. These players soon became a large part of the Over-the-Hill Gang defense. The Redskins also picked up Boyd Dowler, an eleven-year veteran with the Green Bay Packers, who won five championships as a Packer. He would later pick up strong safety Richie Petitbon (again from the Rams) and defensive tackle Ron McDole from the Buffalo Bills.\nThe average age of starters was 31 years old. Allen's strategy turned the Redskins around as the team improved to a 9-4-1 record in 1971, and they finished the 1972 season with an NFC-best 11-3 record. The retooled Redskins' nine victories in 1971 was the most by a Washington team in 29 years. In his seven seasons with the club, Allen and his veterans produced seven winning records, five playoff appearances, and one trip to the Super Bowl.\nIn total, a number of players later inducted into the Professional Football Hall of Fame played under Allen, which included Sonny Jurgenson, Dave Robinson, Ken Houston, Deacon Jones, John Riggins, Chris Hanburger, and Charley Taylor."

Cipriano's Vandal teams improved each year as an independent and went in three seasons.\nHis most notable player was future NBA star Gus Johnson, the tenth overall selection in the and a future hall of famer. After the successful season in 1962–63, Johnson turned professional and Cipriano moved east to Nebraska. The following season, the Vandals were fifth in the new six-team Big Sky Conference (4–6, 7–19 overall).\nNebraska.\nIn March 1963, Cipriano became the head coach at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, hired by his former mentor, Tippy Dye, who became the NU athletic director a year earlier (and hired head football coach Bob Devaney).

The Gators competed in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Eastern Division of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). They were led by head coach Billy Donovan, and played their home games in the O'Connell Center on the university's Gainesville, Florida campus.\nThe Gators were looking to repeat as national champions. The Gators finished the season with a 26–5 record entering the SEC Championship. They won all three games and received the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA tournament. They played in the National Championship game against Ohio State.

On December 13, Junior Al Horford injured his ankle in practice, and missed a few games in December. Horford however, was able to play against Ohio State, on December 23. The Ohio State-Florida game was a highly anticipated match-up, featuring three of the top big men in the country (Horford, Joakim Noah, and Greg Oden). The Gators held Oden to 7 points and went on to win 86–60. The Gators entered SEC play with a 13–2 record. They started out dominating the SEC.

        "title": "Stephen Murphy (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Stephen James Murphy (born 11 December 1981) is a British former professional ice hockey goaltender.\nEarly life.\nMurphy was born in Dundee, Scotland, United Kingdom. He began playing ice hockey at the age of five. He made his first professional appearances at the age of 16 with the Paisley Pirates of the BNL. Murphy made two appearances for the Pirates during the 1997/98 season before moving on to the Fife Flyers. Whilst in Fife, Murphy helped the Flyers win the Scottish Cup. He established himself as the Flyers' first-choice goaltender despite his young age and in the 1998–1999 season recorded a GAA of 3.61 and a save percentage of .918.\nCareer.\nIn 1999, at the age of 17, Murphy became the goaltender for the Great Britain National Team and played on five occasions for them in the World Junior Championships, proving himself to be a reliable last line of defence. This solidified his position as the Flyers' first choice goaltender and he continued to play for them during the 1999–2000 season, featuring in the BNL as well as the B&amp;H Cup and the Christmas Cup. Once again the Flyers made the post-season, with Murphy playing every game in the playoffs.\nIn 2000, Murphy moved to the United States to sign for the Omaha Lancers of the USHL. He failed to make an appearance and moved mid-season to the Cleveland Barons. He finished the 2000–2001 season in Scotland, once again playing for the Flyers. In the summer of 2001, Murphy played again for the Team GB junior squad but also featured for the senior team where he recorded 1.97 goals against average and a .917 save percentage.\nMurphy remained in Scotland for the 2001–2002 term, although he signed for the Dundee Stars and played alongside British hockey great Tony Hand for the first time at club level. Murphy played 43 games for the Stars in the regular season and made 10 post-season appearances. He again appeared for Team GB in 2002, in the World Cup. Murphy remained in his hometown of Dundee for the 2002–2003 season, whilst the British ice hockey organisation was undergoing considerable restructuring.\nA move followed for the 2003–2004 term, this time to the Bracknell Bees, a team now playing in the transitional BNL following the collapse of the ISL. Murphy played eight regular season games for the Bees due to a shoulder injury which kept him off the ice for the remainder of the season. He moved into European hockey for the 2004–2005 season. He found regular games with Swedish Division I team Bräcke IK. After three months, Murphy was poached by the higher level HockeyAllsvenskan team IF Björklöven to play out the remainder of the season for them. Murphy adapted to the change in standard well, and completed the season as a Björklöven player. They failed to make the post-season however and so Murphy returned to Scotland to play in three post-season games for the Stars.\nThe following season, after again playing for Team GB, Murphy returned to IFK Arboga IK. Arboga struggled in the league but managed to retain their membership in HockeyAllsvenskan through playing in the end of season relegation playoffs. Arboga struggled financially however, prompting Murphy to return to the United Kingdom and play for the Edinburgh Capitals in the recently-established EIHL, now the top level of ice hockey in the UK following the lengthy restructuring process.\nMurphy played every regular season game for the Capitals, and won the EIHL 'Best British Goaltender' award for his play. Despite this, the Capitals failed to make the EIHL post-season as they struggled for regular goalscorers. Murphy returned to Scandinavia and Norway to ice for Stjernen Hockey, a team playing in the GET-ligaen, the top club league in Norway. In 36 regular season games, Murphy recorded a 3.18 GAA and a .901 PCT.\nIn the summer of 2008, Murphy was persuaded to once again play alongside Tony Hand, with Hand now acting as player/coach of the EIHL Manchester Phoenix. Murphy had proved an excellent signing for the Phoenix and has once again established himself as the organisation's first choice goaltender. A solid season followed for Murphy, who helped the Phoenix to both the Knockout and Challenge Cup finals and once again was awarded Best British Goaltender. Despite the on-ice success, the Phoenix withdrew from the EIHL at the end of the season in favour of playing in the EPL, going on to sign Steve Fone as first choice goaltender. Murphy chose to remain in the EIHL however, and move on to the Belfast Giants.\nAfter over a decade in Belfast, in March 2021, Murphy was signed by fellow EIHL side Manchester Storm as one of their back-up netminders for the 2021 Elite Series.\nMurphy announced his retirement from the sport in July 2021."

        "title": "Texas Tech Red Raiders basketball",
        "text": "The Texas Tech Red Raiders basketball team represents Texas Tech University in basketball. Texas Tech competes in NCAA Division I, and has been a charter member of the Big 12 Conference since its first season in 1996. The team previously competed in the Border Conference and Southwest Conference. The team was founded in 1925, having since won 13 regular season conference championship, and made 20 appearances in the NCAA tournament as of the 2023-2024 season. Since 1999, the Red Raiders have played their home games at the United Supermarkets Arena on the university's campus in Lubbock, Texas.\nHistory.\n1925–1935.\nTexas Tech's basketball program was founded the same year the school opened its doors in 1925. The inaugural game was a 37–25 loss to Daniel Baker College. Tech would lose two more games before finally clinching their first ever victory—35–21 at Sul Ross University.\nGrady Higginbotham was the first coach, earning a 14–18 record over two seasons. Until Pat Knight, Higgenbotham was the only Tech basketball coach to garner an overall losing record (.438) during his stay. Following Higgenbotham's departure, Victor Payne led the Matadors (as the school's teams were known until 1936) from 1927 to 1930. His final tally stood at 32 wins and 20 losses. W. L. Golightly coached only one season, bringing in an 11–9 record. Dell Morgan held the head coaching job from 1931 to 1934, chalking up 42 wins to 29 losses. He was followed by Virgil Ballard. Though Ballard coached only a single season, it was during his time that the team won their milestone 100th game, a one-point victory over House of David. Ballard left with a 15–9 record.\n1935–1971.\nBerl Huffman was twice the head basketball coach at Texas Tech—first from 1935 to 1942 and then from 1946 to 1947. During his total of eight seasons, he garnered a record of 121–67. Polk Robison was the only other person to serve two different times as the head basketball coach at the school. When Huffman left in 1942, Robison took the job. And, when Huffman left a second time in 1947, it was Robison who again filled the position, this time remaining until 1961. At a total of 18 seasons, his stay is the second longest of any Red Raiders basketball coach, behind Gerald Myers. He departed after leading his teams to 254 wins, 195 losses, and the first two NCAA tournaments in school history.\nGene Gibson followed Robison into the position. In his eight seasons, he chalked up the second best conference record in Texas Tech history and led the Raiders to a Southwest Conference Championship in 1962. Bob Bass led the program to a 22–15 record over a season-and-a-half before returning to professional basketball coaching duties.\n1971–2001.\nGerald Myers became coach of the Red Raiders mid-year during the 1970/71 season and stayed until 1991. His stay was the longest of any head basketball coach at Tech, and several milestones were passed during his tenure, including wins #600 (TCU), #700 (SMU), #800 (at SMU), and #900 (Texas A&amp;M). With a Texas Tech career record of 326–261, Myers has more wins with the Red Raiders than any other men's basketball coach in school history. Myers led Tech to 16 winning seasons, two Southwest Conference championships, three SWC tournament titles, and four NCAA tournament berths. Myers served as the school's athletic director from 1996 to 2011.\nJames Dickey replaced Myers as head coach prior to the 1991/92 season and would remain at Texas Tech until his dismissal at the end of the 2000/01 season. During his 10 seasons at Texas Tech, Dickey amassed a 166–124 win–loss record (164–123 with vacated games omitted). The program also won its 1,000th game under Dickey—a 71–62 victory at UALR.\nDickey took over a Texas Tech program that had finished with a 13–45 combined record over Myers' final two years and led his first team to a winning season and fifth-place finish in Southwest Conference play, after having been picked to finish last in the conference. In his second year as head coach, the Red Raiders won the Southwest Conference tournament championship, the school's fourth, to secure the league's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Texas Tech finished the 1994/95 season with a 20–10 record, sharing the SWC regular season championship with Texas and earning a berth in the 1995 National Invitation Tournament. In the SWC's final season, Dickey's 1995–96 Red Raiders produced one of the most successful seasons in school history and one of the more memorable seasons in the history of the conference, finishing 30–2 overall and undefeated in conference play, winning both the SWC regular season championship and the conference tournament title, advancing to the \"Sweet Sixteen\" in the NCAA Tournament, and finishing #8 in the AP poll and #10 in the Coaches' Poll.\nThe Raiders moved to the Big 12 for the 1996/97 season, and appeared to pick up right where they left off with a solid 19–9 season. For all intents and purposes, however, Dickey's tenure ended on the first day of the inaugural Big 12 basketball tournament. During the Raiders' first-round game, it was discovered that two players had played the entire season while academically ineligible. Hours after that game, Texas Tech announced that it was withdrawing from postseason consideration and forfeiting its entire conference schedule. The Raiders had lost that game, and would have had to forfeit it if they had won. A subsequent investigation revealed massive violations dating back to 1990 in men's basketball and nine other sports. As a result, the NCAA stripped Tech of its two NCAA tournament wins in 1996 and docked it nine scholarships over four years. Dickey was unable to recover from the lost scholarships, and his Red Raiders finished with four consecutive losing seasons, during which they only won a total of 18 games in Big 12 play. He was fired after his 2000/01 team produced a 9–19 overall record.\nBob Knight era: 2001–2008.\nBob Knight served as the Texas Tech men's basketball head coach from 2001–2008.\nHired in March 2001 to replace James Dickey as head coach, Bob Knight quickly improved the program, which had not received a bid to the NCAA tournament nor achieved a winning record since 1996. Knight led the Red Raiders to three NCAA Tournament appearances and one NIT appearance in his first four years at Texas Tech, including an appearance in the Sweet Sixteen in 2005. Texas Tech finished the 2005/06 season with a 15–17 overall record, marking the only time that Knight finished a complete season at Tech with a losing record and fewer than 21 wins. During the 2005–06 season, the ESPN reality TV show centering on Knight and the Red Raiders, \"Knight School\", was filmed. The Red Raiders recovered in 2006/07, finishing 21–13 and again earning a bid to the NCAA Tournament, where they would lose to Boston College in the first round. In both 2006 and 2007, Knight's Texas Tech teams defeated two top 10-ranked teams in consecutive weeks. During Knight's first six years at Texas Tech, the Red Raiders won 126 games, an average of 21 wins per season.\nOn New Year's Day 2007, Texas Tech recorded a 70–68 defeat of New Mexico to give Knight his 880th career victory, making him the highest winning coach in men's college basketball history.\nOn January 16, 2008, Knight registered his 900th career victory when the Red Raiders upset the ninth-ranked Texas A&amp;M Aggies, 68–53. Knight won two more games as head coach—against Missouri and Oklahoma State—prior to announcing his retirement on February 4, 2008, after having led his 2007–08 team to a 12–8 mid-season record. His son Pat Knight, the head coach designate since 2005, was immediately named as his successor. The younger Knight stated that, after many years of coaching, his father was exhausted and ready to retire.\nBob Knight finished with an overall win–loss record of 138–82 at Texas Tech.\nPat Knight era: 2008–2011.\nAfter assuming the head coaching role midseason, Pat Knight's initial two games were defeats on the road. The first was an 80–74 loss to Baylor on February 6, 2008. The second came three days later at Nebraska. Knight's first head coaching win came at home when the Red Raiders upset #18 Kansas State, 84–75, at United Spirit Arena. Going into the game, KSU was in sole possession of first place in the Big 12. On March 1, 2008, the Red Raiders again defeated the top team in the conference by beating #5 Texas, 83–80, ending a month-long, eight-game winning streak for the Longhorns.\nThe Red Raiders finished the regular season with back-to-back losses, first at Kansas and then to Baylor. At the 2008 Big 12 men's basketball tournament, they added another loss—to Oklahoma State—in the first round. The team did not receive an invitation to play at either the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship or at the National Invitation Tournament. Texas Tech did get an invitation to the inaugural College Basketball Invitational, but declined the offer.\nIn the third game of the 2008–09 season, Tech defeated Division II opponent East Central 167–115, setting a new school record for most points scored in a game. The previous record of 128 was set in the double overtime victory over Texas on February 20, 1994. The combined total of 282 points also became a new record.\nOn March 7, 2011, Texas Tech terminated Knight's position as head coach. He left with an overall record of 50–61, becoming the second coach in the school's history to depart with more losses than wins.\nBilly Gillispie era: 2011–2012.\nBilly Gillispie became the head coach of the team on March 20, 2011. He only stayed for one season before resigning on September 21, 2012, in the wake of a school investigation into his treatment of his players.\nTubby Smith era: 2013–2016.\nTubby Smith was hired to replace interim head coach Chris Walker on April 1, 2013, after 6 seasons as head coach of Minnesota. Smith's first season showed some signs of progress, with Texas Tech picking up its first victory over a top-25 team since 2009. Texas Tech's victory over the then #12 Baylor Bears was the first win over a ranked opponent since December 2009, when the team defeated #10 Washington. Smith would later earn another top 25 upset with a victory over #19 Oklahoma State on February 8, 2014. Following outreach by Smith and the athletic department, Texas Tech students broke both school and Big 12 Conference records for student attendance at the United Spirit Arena during a February 25, 2014, loss to Kansas State. The record of 6,086 students fell less than 2,000 short of the national record.\nThe Red Raiders ended Smith's first season with a home victory over the Texas Longhorns, but the Raiders fell to Oklahoma State in the first round of the Big 12 tournament in March. They ended the season with a 14–18 overall record, Smith's first losing season as a head coach. \nUnder Smith, the 2015–2016 Red Raiders finished 9–9 in Big 12 play and advanced to their first NCAA Tournament in nine years, earning an 8-seed in the East Regional. Their season ended in the Round of 64 with a loss to the 9-seed Butler Bulldogs.\nFollowing the season, the Smith era came to an end as Smith resigned on April 14 to coach the Memphis Tigers.\nChris Beard era: 2016–2021.\nTexas Tech hired former Arkansas-Little Rock coach Chris Beard on April 15, 2016, a week after he was appointed to the same position at UNLV. In his second season at the helm, Texas Tech reached the Elite Eight for the first time in school history, with a 78–65 win over the Purdue Boilermakers, where they lost to the eventual national champions, Villanova Wildcats, 71–59.\nWith a share of the Big 12 regular season title, the Red Raiders returned to the NCAA Tournament in 2019 as a #3 seed. Their second trip to the Elite Eight in as many years saw them defeat #1 seed Gonzaga Bulldogs 75–69, clinching their first ever Final Four appearance. They proceeded to defeat the Michigan State Spartans 61–51, reaching their first-ever national title game, where they ultimately lost to another #1 seed, the Virginia Cavaliers, 85–77 in overtime, ending the most successful season in school history.\nBeard departed the program after the 2020–21 season, to take the head coaching job at his alma mater, the University of Texas. Given the rivalry between the two schools, Texas Tech athletic director Kirby Hocutt later remarked, \"Had he gone to any other university, he'd be celebrated. But there's just certain things you cannot do, and one of them is you can't leave Texas Tech for Texas.\"\nMark Adams era: 2021–2023.\nMark Adams, a Texas Tech alumnus and longtime coach around West Texas who had served as Beard's assistant for the last six seasons, was elevated to head coach on April 5, 2021. The Dustin R. Womble Basketball Center, a new 58,000-square foot, $32.2 million practice facility for the men and women's basketball teams, was inaugurated a month later. Coach Adams swept former coach Chris Beard and the University of Texas in his first season at the helm. \nOn March 5, 2023, Texas Tech University announced that they have suspended Coach Adams for using \"racially insensitive\" terms and possibly spitting on a player; Corey Williams led the team in the Big 12 tournament. On March 8, Adams resigned his position.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Red Raiders have appeared in the NCAA tournament 20 times. However, their 1996 appearance was vacated. Their combined record is 19–21 (17–20 without vacated games).\nOn April 6, 2019, Texas Tech earned their first trip to the NCAA tournament championship game with a Final Four win over Michigan State. Two days later, the Red Raiders lost the NCAA tournament championship game in overtime 85–77 to Virginia.\nNIT results.\nThe Red Raiders have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) four times. Their combined record is 6–4.\nNAIA tournament results.\nThe Red Raiders have appeared in the NAIA tournament two times. Their combined record is 3–2.\nHome arenas.\nThe Red Raiders play their home games at United Supermarkets Arena located on the university campus. The Red Raiders previously played at Lubbock Municipal Coliseum until United Supermarkets Arena opened in 1999. The university's first team, then known as the Matadors, did not have a home court but instead played at the Livestock Judging Pavilion until a wood and stucco barn was constructed the following season.\nTexas Tech students broke both school and Big 12 Conference records for student attendance at the United Supermarkets Arena during a February 25, 2014, loss to Kansas State. The record of 6,086 students fell less than 2,000 short of the national record.\nPlayers.\nRing of Honor.\nTexas Tech does not retire jersey numbers, but they do honor players with a Ring of Honor."

He played collegiately for the Arkansas Razorbacks, and in the National Football League (NFL) for the Chicago Bears.\nHigh school and college.\nJames Rouse was a high school star at Little Rock Parkview High School (now known as Parkview Arts and Science Magnet High School), and later signed with the Arkansas Razorbacks under coach Ken Hatfield. Rouse played four years for the Razorbacks (1985, 1987–1989), rushing for 2887 yards and 39 touchdowns, while sharing the backfield with Barry Foster. In the 1987 season Rouse ran for 1004 yards and seventeen touchdowns, giving the Razorbacks their first 1,000-yard rusher since Ben Cowins in 1978. Rouse was a key member on the Razorbacks' back-to-back Cotton Bowl Classic appearances following the 1988 and 1989 seasons. Rouse also played in the Holiday Bowl as a freshman and the Liberty Bowl as a redshirt sophomore. In the four bowl games, Rouse rushed for a total of 281 yards on 57 carries (4.9 avg.) and one touchdown, including a 134-yard effort in the 1990 Cotton Bowl Classic.

        "text": "The 1979 Ice Hockey World Championships took place at the Palace of Sports of the Central Lenin Stadium in Moscow, Soviet Union from 14 to 27 April. Eight teams took part, with the first round split into two groups of four, and the best two from each group advancing to the final group. The four best teams then played each other twice in the final round. This was the 46th World Championship and at the same time, the 57th European Championship. In the May 1978 congress many rules were aligned with NHL practices and archaic rules (like changing ends half way the third period) were finally officially abandoned. The games were very well attended, setting a record by averaging over eleven thousand spectators per game.\nThe Soviets wished the tournament to be finished before the May Day celebrations began, so the schedule was moved up one week allowing for less NHL players being eligible. The hosts won all seven games they played capturing their 16th title, the only game that was even close was their early match with West Germany, which they won three to two. The competition for the bronze (at least) was tight with Sweden edging out the Canadians. After the tournament NHL star Marcel Dionne praised the level of play and offered the following criticism of North American play, \"only the media can change things here. Tell them how the European teams play with so much talent. Tell them that they play without a fight. Let them realize that if a kid does not know how to skate and shoot, but just to fight, he should not be allowed to be a hockey player. There are so many idiots who run hockey, so stupid, so stupid. Tell them.\"\nPromotion and relegation was effective for 1981 as the IIHF ceased running a championship in Olympic years.

This year's tournament was expanded to ten teams to try to avoid hostilities between China and South Korea, and to address a complaint by the Danes that Austria had used an ineligible player in achieving promotion in 1978. China and Denmark were both elevated with the consequence that four teams would be relegated.\nFirst round.\nThe ten teams were split into groups of five, the top two of each battled for promotion to Group A, the next two played in a group to decide fifth through eighth, and both bottom place teams were simply relegated without playing further. Additionally, the top two in each group joined all Group A teams at the Lake Placid Olympics.\nGroup 1.\n\"Hungary was relegated to Group C.\"\nGroup 2.\n\"China was relegated to Group C.\"\nFinal round.\n\"The Netherlands were promoted to Group A.\"\nConsolation round.\n\"Both Austria and Denmark were relegated to Group C.\"\nWorld Championship Group C (Spain).\nPlayed in Barcelona March 16–25.

He previously in the British Elite Ice Hockey League for the Cardiff Devils, Manchester Phoenix and the Braehead Clan.\nCareer.\nIn 2001, Walker began his career icing for the Fife Flyers, his local team, playing at BNL level. Walker made his professional debut at only 14 years of age, registering an assist in his first game. Up until the 2003/04 season, Walker became much more of a regular player, icing on 31 occasions, and gaining his first professional goal. He also represented Great Britain at under 18 and under 20 levels contributing to 3 gold medals along the way and being named top scorer and best player of the tournament in his last appearance at under 20. \nThe following season, Walker remained in the BNL but moved to play for the Guildford Flames, as well as making several appearances for their U-19 team, the Guildford Phoenix. Again Walker was a regular player, turning out another 31 times. Walker was again on the move the following summer, and after the collapse of the BNL signed for the Swindon Wildcats in the EPL. This proved to be Walker's breakout season, in which he managed a total of 63 points in 41 games.\nThis return of points led to him signing for the Cardiff Devils, a team playing in the top tier of British Ice Hockey, the EIHL. Opportunities proved to be limited though, and so in the summer of 2006, Walker moved north to link up with fellow Scot Tony Hand, the player/coach of the Manchester Phoenix.\nIn his first season as a Phoenix player, Walker gave a return of 23 points in 58 games, a statistic which included a hat-trick against the Basingstoke Bison. He was also selected to play in the EIHL All Star game.\nWalker made the decision to stay with the Phoenix the following season, and featured in an injury hit season throughout 2007/08, managing to score 10 points along the way. \nWalker's consistency and work rate again convinced head coach Hand to re-sign him for the 2008/09 campaign where he picked up 29 points in 69 games. \nWalker stayed with the Phoenix for a fourth season through contract, despite the club's decision to move to the EPIHL and several Elite league teams chasing his signature. During the 2009/2010 season, Walker produced a career high of 51 goals and 102 points in 54 games.\nIt was announced that Walker would return to the Elite League, joining newcomers Braehead Clan for the 2010/2011 season. He re-signed for a second season with the Clan on 21 April 2011 where he produced his best points tally in the Elite League with the Clan scoring 26 points. Walker further extended his contract for a third season on 9 February 2012.\nOn 30 October 2013 Walker signed for the EPIHL's Telford Tigers. On 3 June 2014 he returned to the Manchester Phoenix.\nWalker retired after the 2014–15 season and became head coach of the Dundee Comets of the Scottish National League in 2016. In 2017, he was named head coach of the Paisley Pirates and came out of retirement to register himself as a player-head coach. He scored 22 goals in 13 games with a total of 37 points in his first season after his two-year retirement.\nThroughout his professional career Walker has played a total of 701 games for club and represented Great Britain on 30 occasions. \nPersonal life.\nHis younger brother Ben Walker is also a professional ice hockey player and is currently playing alongside him at the Paisley Pirates."

The team was sponsored by Philips Dupont Magnetics, a joint venture between the electronics company, Philips, and the chemical company, DuPont. The team rode Concorde bicycles, manufactured in Italy, by several builders that were colour coordinated to the team jersey by Ultima.\nHistory.\nRoy Schuiten was team manager and Jan Gisbers directeur sportif in 1986. Gisbers took over as the team manager the following year and remained until 1992. He was joined by Piet van der Kruijs and Ferdi van den Haute. The team was owned by Manfred Krikke, of Veltec Rentmeester.\nThe team was successful in classics and had a rider second overall in the Tour de France in 1987 with Pedro Delgado and 1988 with Steven Rooks. It also had third place with Erik Breukink in 1990. It won the Tour team classification in 1988 and 1989. PDM rider Gert-Jan Theunisse was second in the 1988 Tour de France, battling former PDM teammate Pedro Delgado, when he tested positive for testosterone and received a 10-minute penalty.\nThe team dropped out of the 1991 Tour de France with reported food poisoning. Team members and team doctor Wim Sanders said in a TV documentary in 2008 that the cause was careless storage of Intralipid, a nutritional aid with which riders had been injected. The team continued one more year, after which the sponsor sold the team to Festina.\nDoping affair.\nIn November 1997 Cyclingnews.com reported an inquiry in The Netherlands, which appeared to reveal doping in the PDM team. Wim Sanders, the doctor from 1990 to 1991, was the centre of the investigation, which was initiated when the general manager of the team, Manfred Krikke, called the Fiscal Information and Investigation Service to investigate. It was said Sanders supplied anabolic steroids and EPO to the team and was responsible for the intralipid affair of the 1991 Tour de France. According to Cyclingnews.com, 1990 was the height of the drug taking in the team and two riders stopped with heart problems; whether this refers to stopping professional cycling or performance-enhancing drugs was unclear. Gisbers denied knowledge of doping."

Cahn's XI also played against some of the provincial teams but these matches were 12-a-side and are not regarded as first-class.\nCancelled tours.\nA planned tour by a team of English amateurs in 1920–21, to be led by the Kent captain Lionel Troughton, had to be called off as the New Zealand Cricket Council was unable to raise sufficient money. A similar tour by an amateur MCC team in 1921–22, to be led by Jock Hartley and to consist mostly of Army officers, was also cancelled by the NZCC, which explained that the weakness of the selected team would be unlikely to draw sufficient crowds to cover costs.\nAttempts to arrange a tour by a West Indian team in the mid-1920s did not come to fruition. At first it was hoped a tour could be arranged for the 1924–25 season, then the 1926–27 season, but it was not possible.\nA request by the New Zealand Cricket Council for a two-Test tour by Australia in early 1931 was turned down by the Australian authorities on the grounds that their players needed a rest after a busy year of two five-Test series. A tour by the best Australian players who had not been selected for the Ashes tour of 1934 was arranged to take place between February and April 1934, but a disagreement between the respective cricket boards about financial terms, and the withdrawal of several of the selected players, led to the cancellation of the tour just before it was scheduled to begin.\nA tour by India was arranged for November 1936 to February 1937, including six first-class matches and eight other matches, but no Tests. It was the brainchild of Arthur Sims and K. S. Duleepsinhji and was to be fully underwritten by Duleepsinhji's cousin the Jam Sahib of Nawanagar, who would also captain the side. Difficulties in India led to the cancellation of the tour in September 1936.\nA Test tour by Australia, planned for February and March 1940, was cancelled after the outbreak of the Second World War. An itinerary of 14 matches – three Tests, four first-class matches against Plunket Shield teams, and seven other matches – had been arranged, and it was expected that Don Bradman would lead a strong team."

Ohio State head coach Woody Hayes made his final appearance in the Rose Bowl, as Michigan represented the Big Ten in the next three editions.\nTeams.\nThis was the second meeting between the teams that season; Ohio State handed UCLA its first loss of the season, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on After the game, Hayes prophetically told his Buckeyes that they would be facing UCLA again in the Rose Bowl; they were the only opponent to score more than fourteen points against Ohio State, and they did it twice.\nOhio State Buckeyes.\nHayes brought an Ohio State team to Pasadena, featuring two-time Heisman Trophy winner Archie Griffin. It was a record fourth consecutive appearance for the 62-year-old Hayes, and his eighth and final appearance in the Rose Bowl. It was also a record fourth Rose Bowl start for Griffin; he was the only player to start in four until joined by Brian Cushing of USC in January 2009.\nOhio State capped an undefeated regular season with a 21–14 win over rival Michigan in Ann Arbor for Hayes' last outright Big Ten championship, and also his last victory over former assistant The Wolverines held the Buckeyes scoreless in the second and third quarters. Tied at and having already tied two non-conference opponents, the Wolverines needed a win to advance to Pasadena. With less than three minutes remaining, Michigan's freshman quarterback Rick Leach was intercepted by sophomore safety Ray Griffin, who returned it thirty yards down to the 3-yard line, and fullback Pete Johnson ran it in for the winning touchdown. Michigan was the Big Ten runner-up for a fourth straight year; in the previous three, they stayed home during bowl season because of conference rules. This year, #5 Michigan (8–1–2) was invited to the Orange Bowl to face #3 Oklahoma, the Big Eight champion.\nOhio State was a heavy favorite to win the Rose Bowl, by two touchdowns or more.\nUCLA Bruins.\nIn his second season as head coach, Dick Vermeil made his only Rose Bowl appearance; weeks later he left for the Philadelphia Eagles of the NFL. In addition to the 41–20 loss to Ohio State, UCLA also fell at home to Washington and was tied by Air Force 20–20, but won their other six conference games, including a fumble-plagued 25–22 win over cross town rival USC to clinch the Rose Bowl berth. In that Friday night after Thanksgiving game, the Bruins fumbled 11 times and lost 8 of them, but their maligned defense bailed them out time and time again.\nUCLA ended up tied with California for the Pac-8 championship, but advanced to the Rose Bowl on the strength of their win in an October matchup with the Golden Bears. The 1975 USC-UCLA game was legendary coach John McKay's final game at the Coliseum; he left for the NFL's expansion Tampa Bay Buccaneers. As it turned out, it was also Vermeil's last game there.\nThis was UCLA's first Rose Bowl appearance in a full decade; in the 1966 edition, they also defeated a team which they had lost to earlier in the season, top-ranked Michigan State.\nGame summary.\nBoth teams wore their home uniforms, Ohio State in scarlet jerseys, and UCLA in powderkeg blue jerseys. The weather was clear and .\nOhio State dominated the first half, but could only muster a field goal on its opening possession. UCLA did not gain a first down until late in the second quarter, but a couple of Ohio State turnovers and a key stop on 4th and 1 by the Bruin defense kept them in the game. The Buckeyes took a slim to the locker room \nThe second half saw underdog UCLA open up its offense, utilizing play-action and passing on first down. This helped open up their veer option rushing attack, and on their first possession of the third quarter, the Bruins marched to a tying field goal. After stopping Ohio State, UCLA then marched for a touchdown and a 9–3 lead (missed PAT). After stopping the Buckeyes again, the Bruins struck for the big play, a 67-yard touchdown pass from Sciarra to speedy flanker Wally Henry, and the 15½-point-underdog Bruins were up 16–3.\nOhio State, which inexplicably began passing the ball with regularity, returned to its dominating ground attack and scored early in the fourth quarter to cut UCLA's lead The Buckeyes got the ball right back, but again tried to resume an air attack. OSU quarterback Cornelius Greene was intercepted by Pat Schmidt, and on the ensuing possession with just under five minutes to play, Bruin running back Wendell Tyler took an option pitch, sped up the sideline, cut back at the perfect instant, and held the ball aloft as he crossed the goal line on a 54-yard run to clinch the game, Another Greene interception killed any chance of a Buckeye last gasp comeback attempt. Woody Hayes then trudged across the field to congratulate Vermeil before the game was over.\nAftermath.\nWoody Hayes had a very short meeting with the press in which he stated, \"We got outcoached and just got beat.\" Aware of the Buckeye loss, the 1975 Oklahoma Sooners played for the number 1 ranking in the 1976 Orange Bowl, with Alabama lurking after already beating Penn State in the Sugar Bowl 13–6. Texas A&amp;M, ranked #2 at the end of the regular season, lost to Arkansas for the Cotton Bowl berth, and then to USC in the Liberty Bowl. Oklahoma would finish #1 in the AP poll after defeating Michigan 14–6 in the Orange Bowl. Ohio State would finish 3rd, and UCLA Fifth. Woody Hayes would finish with a 4–4 record in the Rose Bowl, and would be denied by Bo Schembechler, Rick Leach, and the rest of the Michigan Wolverines from reaching the Rose Bowl and winning the Big Ten championship again. Dick Vermeil was able to move to the Philadelphia Eagles, whom he would lead to the Super Bowl in five years. This was the second time UCLA had defeated the #1 team in the Rose Bowl after having lost to that same team during the season. The other time was in the 1966 Rose Bowl vs. Michigan State. In \"The Official Ohio State Football Encyclopedia\", this loss is listed as one of the most devastating setbacks in Ohio State football history.\nBy the 1982 college football season, UCLA would make the Rose Bowl their home stadium, moving from the Los Angeles Coliseum. As of 2008, the attendance of 105,464 still stands as the largest crowd to ever watch a UCLA football game in the Rose Bowl stadium. It is a record that is not likely to be broken, as the Rose Bowl seating has been reduced to 91,136 for UCLA Bruins Football and 92,542 for the Rose Bowl Game."

In addition to the matches mentioned in the previous paragraph, regular matches were also played against the Straits Settlements and Malaya.\nFollowing the last match against Hong Kong in 1948, political unrest meant that the cricket playing community dwindled, and cricket disappeared for around thirty years.

        "text": "The Nicaraguan Professional Baseball League ( or LBPN), known as the Campeonato Claro for sponsorship purposes, is the professional baseball league of Nicaragua. The league consists of five teams with a 30-game regular season schedule that runs from November to December, followed by a four team playoff round robin; the two best teams advance to a best of seven championship series.\nInaugurated on March 30, 1956, in Estadio Nacional, the first game was between the teams from San Fernando and Bóer. The Nicaraguan public's excitement for baseball grew as foreign professional teams and foreign players came to play in their country. The teams from Bóer and León were the most successful teams in those years with three championships each. Due to economic difficulties, the league had to shut down in 1967, but professional baseball was re-established in 2004. Since then, Bóer has led the league in championships with five.\nInternational competition.\nFrom its inception, the Nicaraguan professional league sought to participate in international club competition. It hosted a tournament billed as the Serie Panamericana, or Pan-American Series, in 1958, inviting the champions of the Colombian and Mexican Pacific Leagues. This tournament, won by Leones de León, was a success; Nicaraguan organizers hoped it would allow them to join the Caribbean Series, but such an invitation was not forthcoming. \nThe LPBN did participate in the Interamerican Series three times in the 1960s, while the Caribbean Series was suspended. It hosted the 1964 edition, which was won by Cinco Estrellas.\nNicaragua was an inaugural member of the Latin American Series, winning the tournament four times in the 2010s.\nThe LPBN would not participate in the Caribbean Series until 2024, when it was invited to participate in the tournament in Miami. Their entry was controversial, because it was alleged that the regime of Daniel Ortega offered $1 million to the Caribbean Professional Baseball Confederation to secure the participation in the tournament."

        "text": "The Indian cricket team began a tour of Australia in December 2007, playing the 4 match Test series for the Border Gavaskar Trophy, followed by a single Twenty20 match on 1 February 2008. They also participated in the Commonwealth Bank tri-series against Australia and Sri Lanka from 3 February to 4 March.\nTour matches.\nBefore heading into the Test series, only one tour game was planned for India, against Victoria. After the Second Test, a second tour game was played, against ACT Invitational XI in Canberra. MS Dhoni led the Indians after regular captain Anil Kumble rested.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nDay One\nAustralia won the toss and elected to bat and after surviving playing and missing and edging some balls through the cordon, built a strong platform with a century opening stand before Phil Jaques was stumped on 66. Ponting and Hussey got out shortly after falling for 4 and 2 respectively. Hayden brought up another Boxing Day a hundred after hitting a four. India then picked up the wicket of a struggling Clarke for 20. Kumble then picked up the wickets of Symonds and Gilchrist. Lee fell for a duck and Hogg was also out leaving Australia 9/323.\nDay Two\nThe second day Johnson and Clark batted well before Clark got out leaving Australia with a healthy score of 343. The Indian team were sent into bat and Dravid and Jaffer batted very slowly before losing early wickets. Tendulkar was the highlight of the innings scoring 62 before being bowled by Clark. The rest of the batting line up fell cheaply all out for 196. Australia then went in to bat late in the day with Jaques and Hayden not out at the end of the day to put Australia in a healthy position at stumps.\nDay Three\nAustralia resumed play firmly on top with all the batsmen getting starts except Ponting with Clarke top scoring with 73. At 7/351 Ponting declared sending India in to bat with a near impossible target of 499 to win. Jaffer and Dravid survived until the end of the day giving India a slight chance of winning.\nDay Four\nIndia lost early wickets on day four and only Laxman and Ganguly scored above 20. The Australian bowlers ripped through the middle order with Johnson getting three along with the match-ending wicket of RP Singh. India were all out for 161 with Australia winning by 337 runs with a day to spare going 1-0 up in the best of 4 series. This also brought up 15 straight Test victories just one behind the record, held by Australia under the captaincy of Steve Waugh.\n2nd Test.\nDay One\nIndia lost the toss again and Australia elected to bat, R.P Singh took Jaques for 0 his first ever Test duck in front of his home crowd. This left Australia 1 wicket down with no runs scored. Hayden followed soon after leaving Ponting and Hussey at the crease. The two survived until lunch Ponting scoring a half century. Harbhajan dismissed Ponting again causing a middle order collapse to leave Australia 6/137. On 30, Symonds was clearly caught behind off the bowling of Sharma but umpire Steve Bucknor controversially did not give it out. Symonds then went on to make 162 not out, with Hogg also scoring his first Test 50.\nDay Two\nIndia dismissed the lower order in the morning with Australia all out for 463. Brett Lee bowled Jaffer before the partnership of Dravid and Laxman took over the crease. Laxman looked to play shots while Dravid was on the defence. Dravid made 55 while Laxman scored his second century at the SCG. Australian took late wickets leaving Tendulkar and Ganguly at the crease at stumps.\nDay Three\nTendulkar made another SCG century scoring 154 not out with the rest of the batsman contributing healthy scores. India held a 69 run lead, quite remarkable considering the position they were in after day one. Hayden and Jaques were unbeaten at stumps.\nDay Four\nJaques was out to Kumble shortly after regaining the lead. Ponting was caught off Harbhajan sparking major celebrations among the Indians. Hayden and Hussey took over the crease with Hayden scoring another hundred. Hayden had to get Ricky Ponting as a runner due to an injury, and was eventually dismissed of Kumble for 123. On the next ball Kumble claimed Clarke for a golden duck. On the hat-trick ball Kumble hit Symonds on the pads, sparking a big appeal from the Indian team, but it was not given. Symonds and Hussey remained unbeaten at stumps.\nDay Five\nAustralia started the final day at a slower rate then what was expected. Hussey went on to make his first century against India ending on 145 not out. Symonds also scored a half century before getting out at slip. With two overs available to bowl before lunch, Australia declared setting India a target of 333 to win. Many commentators opined that Ponting had declared too late in the innings. The situation of the game meant that India needed a run rate of well over 4, nearly impossible on the decaying SCG pitch. Australia needed 10 wickets to win in a minimum of 72 overs.\nBefore lunch Jaffer fell to Lee, as he had in all four innings to date on the tour. The rest of the top and middle order fell without a large change on the scoreboard. The highest score was that of Ganguly who fell to a controversial decision on 51. Captain Anil Kumble led by example after the Laxman dismissal scoring 45 not out and spending over 2 hours at the crease. With just 2 overs remaining on day 5, India had 3 wickets in hand and were 122 runs behind. The game looked destined to be a draw. However, Michael Clarke took 3 wickets in 5 balls to give Australia victory with just 7 balls remaining.\nThe umpiring was heavily criticised after the match, with India believing they had a too-large share of bad decisions. After the match the Indian team sought to replace one of the umpires for the 3rd Test, going against a prior agreement stating that \"Neither team has a right to object to an umpire's appointment.\"\n3rd Test.\nDay One\nIndia won the toss for the first time in the series, and elected to bat first. Virender Sehwag got his first chance in the series and played a typically attacking innings, providing the team with a good start along with Wasim Jaffer. Both openers went within two runs of each other and Australia slowed the scoring for some time. Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid then came in and steadied the ship, taking the team to a relatively safe score with individual fifties before being dismissed, Dravid missing his century by seven runs. Australia took a few wickets at the end of the day to leave the day's honours even with India batting at 297/6 at the end of the day's play. Stuart Clark and Brett Lee were the standout performers for Australia.\nDay Two\nThe Indian batsmen took a few runs before Australia took four wickets for just two runs, closing the innings at 330. In reply, India's young pace attack kept Australia down with some fine swing bowling, pushing Australia down to 5/61. Andrew Symonds and Adam Gilchrist then put up an attacking 102 run partnership to engineer an Australian revival but were soon dismissed in quick succession. Indian captain Anil Kumble claimed Symonds as his 600th Test wicket. The pacers then cleaned up the tail, overcoming a few minor scares from tailenders Mitchell Johnson and Shaun Tait. Australia finished at 212, 118 runs behind, leaving the Indian batsmen to negotiate the last hour of the day's play. Stuart Clark took an early wicket, dismissing Wasim Jaffer, leaving India with a lead of 170 with nine wickets remaining at stumps with Sehwag and nightwatchman Irfan Pathan at the crease.\nDay Three\nThe morning session was finely balanced, with Australia reducing India to 125 for 5. Sehwag fell to Clark, while Brett Lee took the wickets of Rahul Dravid and Tendulkar, and Mitchell Johnson dismissed Sourav Ganguly. India's day was saved by the lower order, led by the 79 of VVS Laxman. Pathan finished on 46 and Mahendra Singh Dhoni a gritty 38, but the biggest irritant to Australia proved to be RP Singh, who scored a career-high 30 as part of a 51-run ninth-wicket partnership with Laxman that took the India lead over 400 runs. India were finally dismissed for 294 when Laxman edged a Lee delivery to Gilchrist. Australia were set a daunting target of 413 to win—greater than all but one successful run chase in Test history to date. Pathan took the wickets of Chris Rogers and Phil Jaques before stumps, leaving Australia on 65/2.\nDay Four\nRicky Ponting and Mike Hussey stayed at the crease for a major part of the morning session. Ishant Sharma troubled Ponting throughout this period, with the Australian captain unable to take control. After a seven-over spell, Anil Kumble was about to replace Sharma with RP Singh, when Virender Sehwag asked him to retain Sharma. The ploy worked and Ponting was dismissed off the first ball of that over. This triggered the fall of the Australian resistance, as they lost four wickets in the session after lunch (including the contentious dismissals of Hussey and Andrew Symonds). Sehwag was brought in to bowl and responded with the prize scalps of Adam Gilchrist and Brett Lee. Towards the end, Michael Clarke (61) kept up the resistance in partnerships of 50 and 24 with Gilchrist and Mitchell Johnson. Johnson himself made his first Test fifty and was involved in a whirlwind partnership of 74 with Stuart Clark, but once last man Shaun Tait came in at the fall of Clark, it was only a matter of time before India took the match; RP Singh did the honours with a yorker that went hit Tait's foot outside the leg stump and rolled onto his stumps, half an hour before the close of the day's play.\nThe game was widely praised for the high standard of cricket on offer throughout. The Indians were particularly praised for coming back from two games down in the series to deny Australia a record seventeenth consecutive Test victory at a venue whose pitch has, over the years, proved to be the downfall of almost every visiting team. Indian captain Anil Kumble considered this win as his best win ever.\nThe defeat also end Australia's unbeaten streak in Tests at the WACA for 11 years after their 1997 loss to the West Indies. As a result, India became first and only Asian team to win a test match at the WACA.\n4th Test.\nDay One\nIndia won the toss and elected to bat first. While India brought in Harbhajan Singh in place of Wasim Jaffer, Australia brought back Matthew Hayden and Brad Hogg replacing Chris Rogers and Shaun Tait.\nIrfan Pathan and Virender Sehwag opened the innings for India. At lunch, India were at 89/2 with Mitchell Johnson taking both the wickets of Irfan Pathan and Rahul Dravid. In the post-lunch session Sehwag (63) and Sourav Ganguly (7) got out, as India went to tea break at 187/4. In the final session of the day, Sachin Tendulkar scored his 39th Test a hundred, and VVS Laxman got out after scoring 51. At the end of the day's play, India were at 309/5 with Sachin and Dhoni remained as the not-out batsmen. Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson both got 2 wickets, while Brad Hogg got the single wicket of Sourav Ganguly. Throughout the day, the bowling was at a slower rate, as Australia completed the day with having only 86 overs bowled, even after 30 minutes of additional play.\nDay Two\nTendulkar and Dhoni took the overnight score to 336 before Dhoni was out, caught by Symonds off the bowling of Johnson, early on the second day. India suffered a blow when Tendulkar's was the next wicket to fall, caught by Hogg off the bowling of Lee; his final score was 153. At lunch, India had reached 405/7 with Kumble and Harbhajan Singh at the crease. The pair ended up putting on a 107-run partnership when Harbhajan was finally out, caught by Gilchrist off Symonds, in the 131st over. Harbhajan's dismissal meant Gilchrist beat Mark Boucher's record for wicket-keeper dismissals; Gilchrist became the new record-holder with 414 dismissals. Following the day's play, Gilchrist announced that the Adelaide Test would be his last, effectively retiring from Test cricket and from all international cricket once the one-day series with India and Sri Lanka concluded in March. India were finally dismissed for 526 after tea on the second day, they now needing to dismiss Australia cheaply to be in a good position of winning the Test and thereby squaring the series. Johnson proved to be the most effective of the Australian bowlers, finishing up with innings figures of 4/126. With Australia having to face 21 overs before stumps on the second day, India were disappointed not to take a wicket, Australia ending the day on 62/0.\nDay Three\nAny hope of an Indian breakthrough early on the third day soon evaporated as Australia's openers, Jaques and Hayden, continued to make runs. They batted cautiously, averaging 3 runs an over, and ended up putting on 159 for the first wicket. Kumble made the breakthrough not long after lunch when he bowled Jaques. Hayden was able to make his 30th Test century before he was bowled by Sharma on 103. Ponting and Hussey then guided Australia safely to 225/2 at tea, making the most of the placid pitch. Pathan then bowled Hussey shortly after tea and Australia's score was 241/3. Ponting and Clarke batted out the rest of the day, however, and with Australia finishing on 322/3, a draw was looking the most likely result.\nDay Four\nThe Adelaide pitch continued to hold up for the batsmen and Ponting and Clarke took off largely from where they left the previous day. The pair ended up making a 210-run partnership before Ponting was bowled by Sehwag after lunch on the fourth day. He had ended up with 140 runs off 396 balls, the cautious batting reflecting Australia's desire not to be dismissed cheaply and risk losing the Test and a series victory. Clarke had become the fourth batsman in the Test to make a century after he reached 100 in the over where Ponting was dismissed; he was out finally to Sharma, caught by Laxman, on 118 and Australia's score was 490/5. His dismissal brought Gilchrist to the crease in what was looking increasingly like his last Test innings given that it was the fourth day and India were still to bat again. However, any hope of final innings glory was dashed when Gilchrist was dismissed cheaply by a catch from Sehwag in the covers off the bowling of Pathan. His final Test score was 14 and he finished up with career figures of 5,570 runs at an average of 47.60. The score was now 506/6 and 30 from Symonds, with some late contributions from Hogg and Johnson, allowed Australia's innings to conclude at 563, a slight first innings lead of 37. The wickets were spread relatively evenly among India's bowlers, with both Pathan and Sharma taking three wickets each. With a further 17 overs to play, India started their second innings and had reached 45/1 at stumps on the fourth day.\nDay Five\nAfter the loss of the first wicket the previous day, India batted solidly and had made 128 before the loss of its second wicket, Tendulkar, shortly before lunch. With Australia needing a cheap dismissal of India to have any hope of winning the Test, Sehwag put paid to this outcome by making a commanding 151. By the time he was out after tea, India had made 253/6 and had put the Test out of danger. With a draw being the only possible result, Kumble did the inevitable and declared India's innings over at 269/7, causing play to finish early. The outcome of the Test reflected both the closeness of the series and the evenness between the two sides.\nCommonwealth Bank Series.\nThe 2007-08 edition of the Commonwealth Bank Series was a One Day International cricket tournament held in Australia. The Commonwealth Bank Series is an annual event involving the national teams of Australia, India and Sri Lanka. India won the event with a 2–0 sweep of the hosts in the final series.\nThe first two matches were shaping up for excellent contests after their first Innings. However heavy rain in Brisbane, caused by a cyclone in the Pacific Ocean, saw the first two matches of the series abandoned. Australia was first to win a match in the series after a Sri Lanka collapsed in game 3.\nAustralia was the best team during the regular matches, taking 4 wins with bonus points. However, India defeated Australia 2–0 in the best of 3 final series to win the tournament. This is the second time in a row Australia has lost their home tri-nations' series. Last year they lost to England. Fast bowler Nathan Bracken was the leading wicket taker in the tournament with 21 wickets and was named Player of the Series. Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist and left-arm spinner Brad Hogg retired from One Day International after the second final.\nControversies.\nUmpiring incidents\nThe Second Test witnessed many controversial umpiring decisions from the two on-field umpires - Steve Bucknor and Mark Benson - and even the third umpire. The first of Bucknor's gaffes occurred when he did not give Andrew Symonds out caught behind at 30 when TV replays clearly showed that the ball had touched the bat's edge. The second was when Bucknor did not refer a stumping call against Symonds (now 148) to the third umpire. Replays showed the Australia all-rounder's foot wasn't grounded inside the crease when the bails came off. Symonds went on to make 162 not out and brought Australia back into the game. After these incidents, Symonds said, \"I was very lucky. I was out when I was 30, given not out. That's cricket though, I can sit here and tell you about my bad decisions as well - but I won't.\" On the fifth day, Bucknor declared Rahul Dravid out caught behind though television replays later showed the ball had brushed his pad without touching his bat. In response to an official complaint about Bucknor's umpiring from the BCCI, the International Cricket Council (ICC) withdrew Bucknor from umpiring in the Third Test, and assigned Billy Bowden as his replacement. The other incident was when Benson consulted the fielding captain, Ricky Ponting, instead of Bucknor at square leg on whether Michael Clarke had taken the catch of Sourav Ganguly cleanly; he gave Ganguly out but the replay showed that the ball was touching the ground. (There had been a pre-series agreement between the captains about taking the fielder's word on catches; it was dropped after this Test.) These and other umpiring errors created a huge backlash against the Australian cricket team for not playing in the spirit of the game.\nMonkeygate and unsportsmanlike conduct\nFollowing the Second Test, there was speculation that the tour could be in jeopardy due to the fallout of an incident between Harbhajan and Symonds, with referee Mike Procter issuing a three-match ban against Harbhajan for racial sledging. This resulted in the Indians feeling hard done by; the ban was later rescinded after an appeal before a New Zealand High Court judge. Other acrimony included the reporting of Brad Hogg for unsportsmanshiplike conduct, reports of sledging by the Australian team and the scrapping of the captains' agreement about taking the fielder's word on catches. Indian captain Anil Kumble echoed the Bodyline quote, saying during an interview immediately after the match \"Only one team was playing with the spirit of the game, that's all I can say.\""

        "title": "2018 Commonwealth Games",
        "text": "The 2018 Commonwealth Games, officially known as the XXI Commonwealth Games and also known as Gold Coast 2018, was an international multi-sport event for members of the Commonwealth that was held on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia, between 4 and 15 April 2018. It was the fifth time Australia had hosted the Commonwealth Games and the first time a major multi-sport had an equal number of events for male and female athletes.\n4,426 athletes including 300 para-athletes from 71 Commonwealth Games Associations took part in the event. The Gambia, which withdrew its membership from the Commonwealth of Nations and Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) in 2013, was readmitted on 31 March 2018 and participated in the event. With 275 sets of medals, the games featured 18 Commonwealth sports, including beach volleyball, para triathlon and women's rugby sevens. These sporting events took place at 14 venues in the host city, two venues in Brisbane and one venue each in Cairns and Townsville.\nThis was the first Commonwealth Games to take place under the CGF presidency of Dame Louise Martin. The host city Gold Coast was announced at the CGF General Assembly in Basseterre, Saint Kitts, on 11 November 2011. Gold Coast became the seventh Oceanian city and the first regional city to host the Commonwealth Games. These were the eighth games to be held in Oceania and the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe host nation Australia topped the medal table for the fourth time in the past five Commonwealth Games, winning the most golds (80) and most medals overall (198). England and India finished second and third respectively. Vanuatu, Cook Islands, Solomon Islands, British Virgin Islands and Dominica each won their first Commonwealth Games medals.\nThe 2018 Commonwealth Games boosted the Queensland economy by more than A$2.4 billion between 2013 and 2022.\nHost selection.\nOn 22 August 2008, the Premier of Queensland, Anna Bligh, officially launched Gold Coast City's bid to host the Commonwealth Games in 2018. On 7 April 2009, the ABC reported a land exchange deal between Gold Coast City and State of Queensland for Carrara Stadium. According to Mayor Ron Clarke, the land would aid a potential bid for the 2018 Commonwealth Games.\nThe land exchanged would be used as the site of an aquatics centre. In the same article, Mayor Clarke raised the question of the Australian Federal Government's commitment to a 2018 Commonwealth Games bid in light of the Government's support for Australia's 2018 FIFA World Cup Finals bid. On 16 April 2009, Queensland Premier Anna Bligh told reporters that a successful Commonwealth Games bid by Gold Coast City could help the tourist strip win a role in hosting the World Cup.\n\"Some of the infrastructure that would be built for the Commonwealth Games will be useful for Gold Coast City to get a World Cup game out of the soccer World Cup if we're successful as a nation,\" she said. However, the decision on the venues for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups were made eleven months prior to the bid decision for the 2018 Commonwealth Games, so the potential World Cup venues had already been chosen. On 3 June 2009, Gold Coast City was confirmed as Australia's exclusive bidder vying for the 2018 Commonwealth Games. \"Should a bid proceed, Gold Coast City will have the exclusive Australian rights to bid as host city for 2018,\" Bligh stated.\n\"Recently I met with the president and CEO of the Australian Commonwealth Games Association and we agreed to commission a full and comprehensive feasibility study into the potential for the 2018 Commonwealth Games,\" she said. \"Under the stewardship of Queensland Events new chair, Geoff Dixon, that study is now well advanced.\" On 15 March 2010, it was announced that the Queensland Government will provide initial funding of A$11 million for the 2018 Commonwealth Games bid.\nThe Premier of Queensland has indicated the Government's support for the bid to the Australian Commonwealth Games Association. On 31 March 2010, the Australian Commonwealth Games Association officially launched the bid to host the 2018 Commonwealth Games. In October 2011, Gold Coast City Mayor Ron Clarke stated that the games would provide a strong legacy for the city after the games have ended.\nOn 31 March 2010, a surprise bid was made for the 2018 Commonwealth Games by the Sri Lankan city of Hambantota. Hambantota was devastated by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, and is undergoing a major face lift. The first phase of the Port of Hambantota is nearing completion and it is funded by the government of China. The Mattala International Airport, which is the second international Airport of Sri Lanka is built close to Hambantota. A new Hambantota International Cricket Stadium had also been built, which had hosted matches in the 2011 Cricket World Cup.\nOn 10 November 2011, the Hambantota bidders claimed they had already secured enough votes to win the hosting rights. However, on 11 November it was officially announced Gold Coast City had won the rights to host the games.\nDevelopment and preparation.\nThe event was overseen by the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games Corporation (GOLDOC). The GOLDOC was formed in 2012 by the Government of Queensland. Its headquarters were located in Ashmore, a suburban region of Gold Coast. In February 2012, Mark Peters was appointed chief executive officer of the GOLDOC. The Queensland Government Minister Kate Jones was tasked with overseeing the Games. Peter Beattie served as the Chairman of GOLDOC who was appointed on 17 May 2016 to replace Nigel Chamier .\nVenues.\nThe Gold Coast 2018 was hosted across 18 venues located on the Gold Coast and in Brisbane, Townsville and Cairns. Sporting venues were well ahead available of Gold Coast 2018 ensuring that they were used and tested before the Games. The Australian and Queensland Governments and the City of Gold Coast invested A$320 million to deliver new and upgraded venues. Lendlease was the overlay delivery partner and official supporter property and infrastructure of the Games.\nVenues on the Gold Coast.\nCarrara Stadium, located in the suburb of Carrara, was the main venue for Athletics, the Opening ceremony and the Closing ceremony. The seating capacity of the stadium was temporarily increased to 40,000 for the games by the installation of a large temporary North Stand. The new Carrara Sports and Leisure Centre hosted the Badminton, Para Powerlifting, Weightlifting and Wrestling events. The Carrara Indoor Sports Stadium hosted the back-of-house event operations.\nThe Gold Coast City Convention and Exhibition Centre, located in the suburb of Broadbeach, hosted Basketball and Netball (preliminaries) and also served as the Main Media Centre and International Broadcast centre hosting over 3000 members of the worlds press.

Track Cycling was held at the Sleeman Sports Complex in the suburb of Chandler, where a new indoor cycling velodrome (Anna Meares Velodrome) was built. The Velodrome's seat capacity was 4,000 during the games mode.\nThe Shooting disciplines were held at the Belmont Shooting Centre. In Tropical North Queensland, the Cairns Convention Centre and Townsville Entertainment Centre hosted the preliminary rounds of both the men's and women's basketball competitions.\nAthletes village.\nThe Athletes Village was officially opened from 25 March 2018 and provided accommodation and services to 6,600 athletes and officials in 1252 permanent dwellings. It was located in Southport, Gold Coast. There were 1170 one and two-bedroom apartments and 82 three-bedroom townhouses. The village had three zones - International, Residential and Operational.\nThe residential zone accommodated athletes and officials and also offered recreation, gym and medical facilities. The equipment in the gym was sponsored by Technogym. Adjoining the gym was the Athlete Recovery Area. The International Zone consisted of retail services, shops and the main dining hall. The Festival 2018 events were also held in the International Zone. The Dining hall served over 18,000 meals per day to the athletes during the Games. Australian telecommunications company Optus opened a store in the International zone named \"Yes Optus Store\" which provided free calling services to the athletes and officials and other services such as phone charging and watching events of the Games in televisions. Optus also provided free Wi-Fi services in the village.\nFinancing.\nThe sports-related costs of Gold Coast 2018 was A$1.5 billion (US$1.2 billion).\nCountdown.\nThe countdown clocks were unveiled on 4 April 2013, exactly five years from the opening ceremony of the games.

The Countdown Clock was the first fixed element of the Commonwealth Games visual identity program.\nTicketing.\nThe ticket requests began on 24 April 2017 and ended on 22 May 2017. The first round of tickets were allocated on 22 June 2017 via a computer-generated ballot system. About 70% of the people who applied for the tickets had received some or all of the tickets requested in the first phase. In Australia, ticket prices ranged from A$10 for many events to A$495 for the most expensive seats at the opening ceremony. The games expected to have 1.2 million tickets for sale. Around 1.06 million tickets were sold by 3 April 2018. Ticketek was the provider of ticketing services for the Games.\nQueen's baton relay.\nThe Queen's baton of the 2018 Commonwealth Games had a distinctive loop design and was made of macadamia wood and recycled plastic sourced from Gold Coast waterways. Its design was inspired by the Queensland's \"vibrant spirit and indigenous heritage\" and with sustainability.\nThe design of the baton was unveiled on 20 November 2016 at a special ceremony in the Jupiter Gold Coast hotel. The baton was designed by the Brisbane-based firm Designworks. At the 2018 Good Design Awards conducted by the Good Design Australia, the baton won the Best Product Sport and Lifestyle award.\nThe Queen's baton relay was launched on Commonwealth Day, 13 March 2017, on the historic forecourt at Buckingham Palace in London, signalling the official countdown to the start of the Games. Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Edward, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II heralded the start of the relay by placing her 'message to the Commonwealth and its athletes' into the distinctive loop-design Queen's Baton which then set off on its journey around the globe.\nThe baton traveled for 388 days, spending time in every nation and territory of the Commonwealth. The Gold Coast 2018 Queen's Baton Relay was the longest in Commonwealth Games history. Covering 230,000 km over 388 days, the baton made its way through the six Commonwealth regions of Africa, the Americas, the Caribbean, Europe, Asia and Oceania. The baton landed on Australian soil in December 2017 and then spent 100 days travelling through Australia, finishing its journey at the opening ceremony on 4 April 2018, where the message was removed from the Baton and read aloud by Charles, Prince of Wales.\nTourism Australia and QSuper sponsored the international and Australian segment of Queen's Baton Relay respectively, while Longines sponsored both the segments.\nMedals.\nThe medals for the Games were officially unveiled at a charity gala held on 4 November 2017. Australian Indigenous artist Delvene Cockatoo-Collins designed the medals, while they were produced by the Royal Australian Mint. The design of the medals was inspired by the coastline of Gold Coast along with Indigenous culture.\nFurthermore, Cockatoo-Collins mentioned, \"the medal design represents soft sand lines which shift with every tide and wave, also symbolic of athletic achievement, The continual change of tide represents the evolution in athletes who are making their mark, Records are made and special moments of elation are celebrated\". Approximately 1,500 medals were created to be distributed to the medalists and each measures approximately 63 millimetres in diameter. The medals weigh between 138 and 163 grams.\nVolunteering.\nOver 15,000 volunteers were hired for the Games. Over 45,000 applicants applied to become a volunteer. The uniforms for the volunteers were revealed on 11 November 2017 at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre. Former Gold Coast Titans player Mat Rogers who was present at the uniform showcase ceremony, said that the uniforms were \"very Gold Coast\" and it was like an \"active wear\". Hard Yakka was the official supplier of the uniforms for the volunteers.\nTransport.\nDuring the Games period, free public transportation within Queensland region was provided to ticket and accreditation holders. The free transportation services were available on local buses, train and Gold Coast light rail (G:link) services on the Gold Coast and on TransLink and Qconnect bus services in Cairns and Townsville.\nThe Gold Coast light rail system, connected a number of the key games venues including the Optus Aquatic Centre, Broadwater Parklands and the Gold Coast Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre with the major accommodation centres of Surfers Paradise and Broadbeach and the Athletes Village at Parklands. An extension to the system was announced in October 2015, connecting the then current terminus at Gold Coast University Hospital to the railway line to Brisbane at Helensvale. The extension opened in December 2017, in time for the games.\nFour temporary Games lanes were introduced along the M1 and activated at different times to decrease traffic disruptions for road users. These were used by police and emergency vehicles, spectator shuttle buses and accredited Games family and athletes. The Gold Coast Airport served as the official airport for the Games.\nSecurity.\nA total of 3,500 police officers from Queensland and 4,000 security personnel from the Australian security companies MSS Security, Wilson Security, SecureCorp and SNP were present at the Games. The Australian Defence Force (ADF) assisted Gold Coast authorities in ensuring the security of the Games and deployed over 1,000 personnel to help with the effort.\nFurthermore, Operation ATLAS was the codename for the ADF contribution to the security of the Games.

American cyber security software company Symantec provided IT and cyber security services for the Games.\nAnti-doping.\nThe Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority conducted an anti-doping drive in the months prior to the Games, covering around 2500 tests of Australian athletes, as well as 500 tests against international athletes. Three Australians failed drug tests in this process, along with around 20 international athletes, subject to appeal. The Commonwealth Games Federation conducted in-competition testing and, matching protocol at the Olympic Games, launched a sample storage initiative to allow for future testing of samples up to ten years later, should detection technology improve.\nFestival 2018.\nThe Festival 2018 was a 12-day multi-arts program for the 2018 Commonwealth Games which included free musical performances, activities, public art and other family-friendly events.

It was chosen to highlight the dreams and experience at the games that were shared by participants of the games, ranging from athletes to volunteers and the host country Australia to the world including the Commonwealth nations.\nEmblem.\nThe emblem was launched on 4 April 2013, which marked exactly five years until its opening ceremony. It was unveiled at the Southport Broadwater Parklands. It was designed by the New South Wales based brand consultancy WiteKite. The emblem of the 2018 Commonwealth Games was a silhouette of the skyline and landscape of Gold Coast, the host city of the games. Nigel Chamier , former Chairman of the GOLDOC, said that it was the result of months of market research.\nMascot.\nBorobi was named as the mascot of the 2018 Commonwealth Games in 2016. Borobi is a blue koala, with indigenous markings on its body. The term \"borobi\" means koala in the Yugambeh language, spoken by the indigenous Yugambeh people of the Gold Coast and surrounding areas. The song \"Days of Gold\" composed by the Australian Duo band Busby Marou, which was released on 17 October 2014, was considered as the official song of the Mascot Borobi.\nSponsors.\nThe official partners of the games were The Star Gold Coast, Griffith University, TAFE Queensland, Longines, Optus, Atos and Woolworths Supermarkets. Griffith University was also the Creative Arts partner of the games and Presenting partner of the Gold Coast Marathon. TAFE Queensland was responsible for providing vocational education and training program for the volunteers of the games. Longines served as the official timekeeper of the games.\nMusic.\nAustralian singer Delta Goodrem wrote the song \"Welcome to Earth\", which is about the planet Earth and the theme of the opening ceremony. She performed the song live during the ceremony and was worldwide praised. The song was worldwide released on 5 April 2018 in Delta Goodrem's official YouTube channel.\nConcerns and controversies.\nTeam India violated the Games No-needle policy two times. Just two days before the opening of the Games, a cleaner found needles in a bottle in the Athletes' Village. The Games official found that the syringes belonged to an Indian doctor which he used to inject vitamin B12 to an Indian athlete and did not dispose them properly after using them and violated the Games no-needle policy. As a result, the Indian team officials received serious warnings from the Games officials. Later two Indian athletes were suspended from the Games as needles were found in their apartment which was also against the Games policy.\nAt least 13 athletes from four countries - Cameroon, Uganda, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone - absconded during or immediately after the Games. Some missed their competitions. A month after the games ended, officials estimated that 50 athletes had remained in Australia illegally, with another 200 staying in the country on visas. In October 2019, it was found from the official documents that the Department of Home Affairs had rejected the asylum claims of 217 out of 230 athletes. The official documents also found that 17 \"unlawful non-citizens\" who took part in the Commonwealth Games were still in Australia, 14 of which were from Ghana and Rwanda. A total of 13 remain unaccounted for, while four were in detention.\nThe organising committee of the Games decided to bring in the athletes before the start of the closing ceremony. This caused an uproar on social media as, contrary to public expectations, none of the athletes were shown entering the stadium during the ceremony. Broadcast rights holders Channel 7 complained on air about the decision and concluded that, \"it hasn't really lived up to expectations\". Many spectators and athletes left during the ceremony, resulting in a half-empty stadium for much of the event. Following this, the ABC claimed that Channel 7 was briefed on the closing ceremony schedule, a claim which Channel 7 later refuted.\nLegacy.\nEvents.\nThe city hosted the 17th Sport Accord World Sport and Business Summit from 5 to 10 May 2019 at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre.\nQueensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced on 9 December 2019 that the state of Queensland would make an official bid for the 2032 Summer Olympics featuring venues across Brisbane, Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast. Without rival cities, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) awarded the 2032 Olympics to Brisbane."

        "text": "The 2007–08 Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball team represented Vanderbilt University in the 2007–08 college basketball season. The team was led by head coach Kevin Stallings and played home games at Memorial Gymnasium.\nThe 2007–08 team finished the season 26–8, and ranked 25th in both the AP Poll and the ESPN/USA Today (Coaches) poll. Their 16–0 start was the best in school history. The team finished in 3rd place in the SEC Eastern Division with a 10–6 conference record.\nDuring Selection Sunday, Vanderbilt received a #4 seed in the Midwest Region of the 2008 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. They faced #13 seed Siena in the first round on March 21, 2008. The Commodores were upset at a final score of 83–62, becoming the second #4 seed upset after UConn's overtime loss to San Diego.\nPreseason outlook.\nEntering the season, Vanderbilt was picked by the media attending the SEC's media days in October to finish 4th in the SEC East, behind Tennessee, Kentucky and two-time defending national champion Florida.\nVanderbilt lost two starters from last year's team—2007 SEC-player of the year Derrick Byars (19.1 ppg) and shooting guard, Dan Cage (11.2 ppg) – and return three starters—swingman Shan Foster, point guard Alex Gordon and power forward Ross Neltner.\nShan Foster was the Commodores' second leading scorer last season (15.6 ppg) and is the third leading returning scorer in the SEC. Foster was selected by the SEC media to the pre-season all-SEC second team. Alex Gordon had only 51 turnovers last season, tops among starting SEC point guards, and his 2.22-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio was fourth best in the SEC. Neltner provided a versatile presence inside, averaging 5.7 rebounds per game, dishing out 74 assists and hitting 11-of-28 attempts from three-point range.\nSophomores Jermaine Beal and George Drake and freshman Keegan Bell are expected to compete for the shooting guard spot vacated by Cage. The Commodores appear set at center, where senior Alan Metcalfe and freshman Andrew (A.J.) Ogilvy will share time. Metcalfe missed part of last season with a foot injury, while Ogilvy comes highly touted after spending four years at the Australian Institute of Sport. Other newcomers expected to vie for playing time are guard Keegan Bell and forwards Andre Walker and Darshawn McClellan.\nGame recaps.\nRegular season.\nGames 1–4. Vanderbilt (4–0) began its season with an 81–67 home win over Austin Peay (0–1), then won at Toledo (1–1) 77–70. The Commodores beat Valparaiso 87–78 and Utah State 77–56 in the South Padre Island Shootout.\nGame 5. Vanderbilt (5–0) defeated Bradley (4–2) 95–86 in the championship game of the South Padre Island Shootout on November 24, 2007. A.J. Oglivy scored 23 points, and Shan Foster 22, to lead the Commodores. After the Commodores raced to an 18-point halftime lead (53–35), Bradley senior point guard Daniel Ruffin led the Braves back to within 85–84 late in the game. But Alex Gordon hit a 10-foot jump shot and sank four free throws in the final 30 seconds as the Commodores pulled away. Ruffin—the half-brother of former Indiana All-American A.J. Guyton – finished with 23 points and 6 assists. Bradley (22–13 last season, MVC: 10–8, 4th) was picked to finish second in the Missouri Valley Conference this season by the league's coaches, media and sports information directors, behind unanimous first-place selection Southern Illinois.\nGame 6. Vanderbilt (6–0) defeated South Alabama (4–3) 91–88 in double overtime on November 29, 2007. Shan Foster scored 26 points, as the Commodores rallied from a 59–51 deficit with 12:02 left.

With Shan Foster and A.J. Oglivy both struggling, the Commodores trailed 58–40 after Dar Tucker scored on an alley-opp dunk with 15:15 to go. Vanderbilt seemed to revive, finally tying the score at 79–79 with 22 seconds left. Foster and Oglivy, the SEC's top two leading scorers, each finished with 19 points.\nGame 11. No. 17 Vanderbilt (11–0) (AP and Coaches polls) had to overcome a large second half deficit for the second game in a row, downing Tennessee State (3–7) 83–74 on December 22, 2007.

The Commodores achieved their best ever start, bettering a 12–0 start in 2003–04. After trading baskets for much of the first half, the Commodores built a 5-point lead at halftime. Unlike their previous game, the Commodores went on a 26–5 run to start the second half, putting the game out of reach and allowing the walk-on players to get some playing time. Vanderbilt continued to display a lax defense, but more than made up for it by shooting 56% from the floor and 55% from beyond the arc. Vanderbilt had four players in double figures, led by A.J. Ogilvy (who again just missed a double-double with 20 points and 9 rebounds) and Shan Foster (20 points).\nGame 14.

No. 13 Vanderbilt (16–1, 1–1) (AP, No. 12 Coaches poll) lost its first game of the season, 79–73 in double-overtime to Kentucky (7–7, 1–0) at Rupp Arena. The loss snapped the Commodores' 4-game winning streak against the Wildcats. Vanderbilt entered the game as one of five remaining unbeaten teams in men's Division I basketball. Kentucky controlled most of the game, taking a 16-point lead five minutes into the second half. The Commodores, who never led in regulation, tied the game on a three-pointer by Shan Foster with 14 seconds left to force overtime. The teams traded leads in the first overtime, but Vandy needed an A.J. Ogilvy-putback with 1.8 seconds left to force a second overtime.

The Vols held the Commodores well below their season scoring average (86.0 ppg) and limited them to 3 three-pointers. Vanderbilt stayed close for about 11 minutes, but a 16–3 run gave Tennessee a 33–18 lead with 3:59 left in the first half. After halftime, the Vols used a 17–6 run to take a 59–38 lead, but the Commodores responded with a 15–2 run to make it 61–53 with 7:48 to go. They would get no closer.

The Bulldogs led 38–37 at halftime, but Vanderbilt stormed out of the gates in the second half as they opened on a 29–11 run. The Commodores won the game at a final score of 86–74 with 29 points from Shan Foster and 23 points from Alex Gordon.\nGame 28. No. 18 Vanderbilt (24–4, 9–4) (AP, No. 14 Coaches poll) faced their toughest test of the season as they hosted in-state rivals No. 1 Tennessee Volunteers (25–3, 11–2) (AP and coaches polls).

        "text": "The Archery Trade Association (ATA), is the trade group representing manufacturers, retailers, distributors, sales representatives and others working in the archery and bowhunting industry. The ATA has served its members since 1953. It is dedicated to making the industry profitable by decreasing business overhead, reducing taxes and government regulation, and increasing participation in archery and bowhunting.\nThe organization also owns and operate the ATA Trade Show, the archery and bowhunting industry's largest and longest-running trade show worldwide. The ATA Trade Show is a member-driven, order-writing event to promote commerce within the archery and bowhunting industry. The Show is closed to the public.\nHistory.\nThe ATA was originally formed in Wisconsin in 1953 as the Archery Manufacturers and Dealers Association (AMADA), containing within its initial membership such renowned archers as Fred Bear and Bob Lee.\nOne of its first tasks was standardizing bow and bow string lengths, resulting in a measure called \"AMO standards.\" Today, the industry's 22 essential \"ATA Standards\" are defined in the ATA Technical Guidelines, a manual that represents about 50 years of accumulated engineering knowledge and expertise dating to Earl Hoyt, Dick Mauch (Bear Archery), and Chuck Saunders. Although these early manufacturers were business rivals, they wanted archery dealers and consumers to know their archery equipment met tough, consistent industry guidelines that wouldn't vary by manufacturer.\nIn the 1960s, AMADA shortened its name to the Archery Manufacturer's Organization (AMO). Its membership (mostly consisting of manufacturers) greatly increased in the 1970s after the invention of the Compound bow. In 1991, the organization moved its central location to Gainesville, Florida, under the presidency of Dick Lattimer. In 1997, with the debut of the AMO Archery Trade Show, funding formerly provided by companies' donations was replaced by the profits generated from this event.\nIn 2002, the AMO was reorganized into the Archery Trade Association. The ATA operates as a nonprofit effort to grow archery and bowhunting, and works with several organizations within the archery industry to promote those sports.\nPartnerships and Objectives.\nThe ATA works with several organizations within the archery industry to promote archery and bowhunting. These groups include:\nSome of the ATA's main objectives include:\nMembership.\nIn 2000, the AMO consisted of more than 600 manufacturers, dealers and distributors. Today the annual ATA Trade Show regularly draws more than 600 exhibitors and more than 9,000 attendees. Only ATA members can attend the Show.\nPublications.\nThe ATA regularly contributes material to Inside Archery, ArrowTrade and Archery Business.\nThe ATA also publishes various press releases, and maintains websites such as archerytrade.org and archery360.com.\nAdditionally, it promotes awareness of Chronic wasting disease alongside the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance, of which it is a sponsor."

        "title": "Birmingham Bulls (American football)",
        "text": "The Birmingham Bulls are an American football team based in Birmingham, United Kingdom. They play their home games at Kings Norton RFC in Hopwood. They are a member of the NFC Division One South in the BAFA National Leagues.\nThe Bulls are one of the longer established American football teams playing in the United Kingdom, having been founded in 1983, and are one of the most successful teams in British American Football, winning 4 British titles and 19 conference championships.\nThe Bulls field a senior team in the BAFA National Leagues with Matthew Sheldon the Head Coach since 2018.\nThey also field a youth team in the Under 17 system, and in 2019 they announced a partnership with the Black Country Vipers to provide Under 19s football in the Birmingham-Black Country region.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nJerry Hartman, a former US military policeman and security guard for Howard Hughes with some College Football experience formed the team in a local park, and by April 1984, there was enough interest to begin a fully fledged adult team. They are named after the local landmark, The Bull Ring. and were financed by local businessman Dave Gill, who later became the Bulls' first chairman and would go on to become chairman of the British American Football Association.\nOn Friday 8 June, the Bulls played their first game against the Milton Keynes Bucks at the Alexander Stadium, losing 40–7. They later took residence in Salford Park, underneath the Gravelly Hill Interchange, and in later years, the club attempted to purchase the land from the local council.\nIn 1986, as members of the BAFL, under coach Warren Tate, the Bulls won their first national championship, and represented the UK in the inaugural Eurobowl, finishing third, losing to eventual runners-up, the . In 1988, the Bulls won their second national championship, and first in the Budweiser League, beating the London Olympians at Loftus Road 30–6, and again qualifying for the Eurobowl. However, they once more lost to the eventual runners up, this time the Amsterdam Crusaders.\nIn 1989 off-season, the entire Bulls starting secondary was arrested on charges ranging from armed robbery to assault. Now owned by local businessman and Don Ho impersonator Frank Leadon, the team suffered internal strife with American lineman James Thornton regularly threatening to get himself deported, with Leadon himself leaving the club and returning multiple times. Businessman and father of nose tackle Andy Webb, Dave Webb took over ownership of the team part way through the season, with the Bulls' payroll the highest in the league.\nthe Bulls again made the Budweiser Bowl to challenge for the national championship, but just hours before the game, star quarterback and coach, Russ Jensen, left the team for financial reasons. The Bulls lost to the Manchester Spartans 21–14. In the same year, due to protests against Apartheid from the Bulls' supporters club, the team turned down the offer of a tour of South Africa, estimated at the time to be worth $100,000. It was in 1989 that former sportswriter for the Boston Herald, Michael Globetti, joined the Bulls and authored the book \"God Save The Quarterback!\".\nThe nineties.\nUnder the banner of the NDMA league, the Bulls took their third national championship in 1991, defeating the London Olympians 39–38 at the Alexander Stadium, with kicker Mark Webb scoring the winning field goal with just 17 seconds remaining. In 1992, the Bulls again faced Eurobowl disappointment, falling to the eventual winners, the Amsterdam Crusaders once more. The result of the loss was challenged by the Bulls due to player registration issues, but the appeal failed. This failed appeal was part of the reasoning given for the withdrawal of BAFA from the European governing body.\nIn 1995, the Bulls won their most recent national championship, defeating the London Olympians once more, in a 34–30 game. However, the Olympians got their revenge later in the year, knocking the Bulls out of the Eurobowl at the quarter-final stage, before going onto finish as runners-up. After a re-invention, the Bulls began life in Division 2 in 1996.\nThe Bulls reached the national championship again in 1999, but fell to the London Olympians in a close, defence-heavy 9–6 loss.\nNew millennium and recent years.\nThe result of the 1999 Britbowl was repeated a year later in 2000, when the London Olympians again defeated the Bulls in the national championship game, 34–26.\nThere followed a down period in the Bulls history, marked by several play-off appearances, a lone conference championship in 2005, and emerging rivalries with the Coventry Jets and Tamworth Phoenix.\nAs the Bulls attempted to emerge from the mediocrity of the 2000s, they focused heavily on recruitment within the local area, but they still struggled in the BAFA Premier Division North. In 2013, the Bulls junior team finished an undefeated season by defeating the Woodham Warriors in the junior Britbowl at Keepmoat Stadium, and were crowned national champions.\nThis would be the last year that the Bulls fielded a junior team, as a new team was formed through links with the BUAFL team, the Birmingham Lions and the newly founded Sandwell Steelers.\nIn 2014, in the second and final year of former Redditch Arrows head coach Ian Hill's tenure, despite a large rookie contingent, the Bulls came within one game of making the play-offs. 2015 saw a league restructure and the Bulls found themselves placed in the Division One SFC North, with former player, Mark Pagett, taking over the reins.\nFollowing a further restructure, the Bulls played the 2016 season in the Midlands Football Conference 1.\nAt the end of the 2017 season the Bulls were relegated into Division Two of the BAFA National League system after winning just one of their ten games. They finished with the same record as Coventry Jets but were relegated based on the head-to-head record having each won one of the two games but with the Bulls defeat to the Jets by a greater points margin.\nHead Coach Mark Pagett resigned at the end of the 2017 season with long serving player Matthew Sheldon taking over the reins.\nThe Bulls were placed in the Division 2 NFC South. With an eight-game regular season schedule the Bulls finished with 7 wins and 1 defeat, losing their final league fixture 14–8 at home to Staffordshire Surge which ensure their rivals were crowned division winners. The Bulls entered into the play-offs as the number 4 seed and after a 16–6 win at home to Halton Spartans in the quarter-final they faced a long trip north to Aberdeen to face the Roughnecks for a place in the Northern Conference Final where the Bulls fell in a 16–14 defeat.\nIn the 2019 season, the Bulls completed a perfect regular season, finishing 8–0 in the NFC2 South moving into the play-offs as the number 1 seed in the Northern Conference. In the quarter-final they faced division rival Staffordshire Surge and won through to the semi-finals with a 43–6 victory. In the semi-final they once again fell to a Scottish team to miss out on promotion to Division 1, Inverclyde Goliaths securing promotion and Bowl place with a 30–12 victory.\nIn November 2019 the new league structure saw the Bulls moved into the SFC2 Central Division where they will face Ouse Valley Eagles, Worcestershire Black Knights, Northants Knights and Hereford Stampede.\nLogos and uniforms.\nThe Birmingham Bulls traditionally play with white helmets, with one thicker black stripe surrounded by two thinner red stripes. Their facemask colour is black. A cut-out of the Bull from the full team logo is positioned on both sides of the helmet. In 2013, the Bulls celebrated their 30th anniversary and reverted to the use of their original \"Three Legged Bull\" logo for a season.\nTheir home jerseys are typically black, with white numbers and a red trim, while their away jerseys are reversed, being mainly white, with black numbers and maintaining the red trim. Their game pants for both home and away kits are white, with a black and red stripe running the length of the leg. The Bulls have traditionally worn mostly black socks.\nAs part of a new look for the club from the 2018 season onwards the Bulls play in all black uniforms with the changes making their debut in the opening league fixture with Knottingley Raiders on Sunday 15 April 2018.\nThe spring of 2019 also saw a new club logo announced as part of a move to re-brand the club for a new era.\nFacilities.\nThe Bulls have played at Kings Norton RFC since 2019.\nRivalries.\nLondon Olympians.\nThe Bulls' rivalry with the London Olympians is largely historic, meeting several times in the late 1980s and early 1990s in both the league and playoffs, with the rivalry coming to a head in the 1988, 1991, 1994 and 1995 Britbowls, with the Bulls winning three to the Olympians one.\nIn recent years, the two have rarely, if at all, played each other due to league realignments and a relative lack of playoff success for both organisations.\nCoventry Jets.\nAside from being purely a local affair, the rivalry became significant when the Jets returned in their latest guise, initiated by several former Bulls, including quarterback Jamie Kilby and Paul Newey.\nThanks in part to geographical proximity, the Jets and Bulls faced each other often. In 2008, the Jets handed the Bulls their heaviest defeat, in a very one sided 67–0 affair. In 2017, the Bulls were relegated to Division 2 after a final day defeat to the Jets. In 2018, the Coventry Jets folded, and were incorporated into the Etone Jaguars.\nTamworth Phoenix.\nThe Bulls' rivalry with the Tamworth Phoenix is not dissimilar to that of the Jets. Whilst they are geographically close, the rivalry was compounded by the fact that the Phoenix were, like many of the younger Midlands teams, founded by former Birmingham Bulls players.\nNotable former players.\nThe following notable players appeared for the Birmingham Bulls during their career:\nYouth &amp; junior football.\nIn 2013, the Bulls youth team finished as national champions.\nThe Bulls field a youth (13-17) and junior (17-19) teams in conjunction with the Black Country Vipers, with the youth team playing under the Bulls' name, and the junior team under the Vipers'."

Canada won both tournaments with victories against the United States, while Finland won both bronze games, however against different opponents.\nIt was the fifth Olympic appearance for Finns Jere Lehtinen and Teemu Selänne, thus making them only the sixth and seventh hockey players to compete at five Olympics after Udo Kießling, Petter Thoresen, Raimo Helminen, Dieter Hegen and Denis Perez (at the time, Helminen was the only ice hockey player to compete at six Olympics, but Selänne would join the group during the 2014 Sochi Olympics).\nChanges from previous tournaments.\nFor the first time, Olympic Games were played on a narrower NHL-sized ice rink, measuring , instead of the international size of . By permitting the use of existing venues without rink modifications, this was expected to save $10 million (CAD) in construction costs and allow more spectators to attend games.\nThis was also the first Olympics in which the four-official system, with two referees and two linesmen, was used during the men's tournament. The NHL began using the two-referee system in the 1998–99 season, while the IIHF first started using it in its major men's championship tournaments in the 2008 IIHF World Championship. However, for the women's tournament in Vancouver, the IIHF used the standard three-official system with one referee and two linesmen, saying that the four-official system is not currently needed in women's international hockey.\nVenues.\nThe games of the 2010 tournament were held at the 6,800 seat UBC Winter Sports Centre and 18,810 seat General Motors Place, which was renamed Canada Hockey Place during the event because corporate sponsorship is not allowed for an Olympic venue. The games were played on a North American ice surface which is four metres narrower than international rinks.\nThe games of the tournament forced the Vancouver Canucks to play the longest road trip in NHL history, playing 14 games over six weeks, from 27 January to 13 March, so that GM Place could be used for the tournament. Because of the Olympics, the ice surface and boards needed to be devoid of advertising and some seating areas needed to be converted to press rows for the duration of the games.\nMen's tournament.\nFollowing negotiations in the National Hockey League's collective bargaining agreement, an agreement was reached allowing NHL participation in both the 2006 and 2010 Winter Olympics. Some NHL team owners opposed having their players participate in the tournament because of concerns that the league's players could get injured or become exhausted. Several players were injured during the 2006 Winter Olympics and were forced to miss NHL games. Gary Bettman addressed the issue saying that several format changes were being discussed, so that the tournament would be \"a little easier for everybody.\"\nQualification.\nQualification for the men's tournament at the 2010 Winter Olympics was structured around the 2008 IIHF World Ranking. The top nine teams in the World Ranking after the 2008 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships received automatic berths into the Olympics, while all remaining member federations could attempt to qualify for the remaining three spots in the Olympics. In October 2008, the four lowest entrants played off for a spot in the first round. Teams then ranked 19th through 30th played in a first qualification round in November 2008, where the top three teams from the round advance to the second qualification round. Teams ranked 10th through 18th joined the three top teams from the first qualifying round to play in a second qualification round. The top three teams from the second qualifying round advanced to the Olympic tournament.\nFormat.\nThe twelve teams in the men's event are seeded into three groups of four teams. In the preliminary round, a team plays one game against every other team in its own group (for a total of 18 preliminary round games). Following the completion of the preliminary round, the teams are ranked 1 through 12 based on the results. The top four ranked teams receive byes to the quarterfinals, with the remaining eight teams playing for the remaining four quarterfinal positions. Following that, the final eight teams play elimination rounds to determine the gold and silver medals, and the two losing teams of the semi-finals play for the bronze medal. Each team is allowed to have 20 skaters (forwards and defensemen) and two or three goaltenders, all of whom must be citizens of the country they represent.\nWomen's tournament.\nQualification.\nThe women's tournament used a qualification format similar to the system used for the men's tournament. The top six teams in the IIHF Women's World Ranking after the 2008 Women's World Ice Hockey Championships received automatic berths into the Ice Hockey event. Lower ranked teams had an opportunity to qualify for the event. Teams ranked 13th and below were divided into two groups where they played in a first qualification round in September 2008. The two group winners from the round advanced to the second qualification round, where the teams ranked seventh through twelfth joined them.\nFormat.\nThe eight teams were split into two divisions of four teams and each team played three preliminary games. Following the completion of the preliminary round, the top two teams from each division advanced to the medal round and competed in a playoff to determine the gold medalist. The other four played classification games. Each team is allowed to have between 15 and 18 skaters (forwards and defensemen) and either two or three goaltenders.\nParticipating nations.\nA total of eight national teams competed in the women's ice hockey tournament.\nUniforms.\nUniforms were produced by Kent Angus, who collaborated with the participating nations to incorporate \"discovery pieces\" into the jerseys. The extra details were national motifs noticeable up close."

        "title": "Lacrosse strategy",
        "text": "The game of lacrosse is played using a combination of offensive and defensive strategies. Offensively, the objective of the game is to score by shooting the ball into an opponent's goal, using the lacrosse stick to catch, carry, and pass the ball. Defensively, the objective is to keep the opposing team from scoring and to dispossess them of the ball through the use of stick checking and body contact or positioning.\nSettled offense: the 2-3-1.\nThe most common offense used in settled situations is known as the \"2-3-1\" (sometimes counted in the opposite direction, as a 1-3-2, or shortened to be called the 1-3 or 13). The numbering begins with the two midfielders at the top of the field, then continues to the two attackmen on the wings and the midfielder on the crease, and finally the last attackman located at \"X\", the position behind the goal.\nThe offensive team should pass the ball around the perimeter and look for weaknesses in the defense. They will also rotate, in two triangles. The midfielders will rotate in a triangle, across the top, and to and from the crease. The attackmen will rotate to and from X, and across the crease to the opposite wing. A player may \"carry\" the ball in a rotation as well; for example, a middle at the top right will carry to the top left, while the top left middle will cut to the crease, and the crease midfielder will cut into the space where the ball carrier came from.\nDriving to the goal is aided by the triangle rotations, as it is difficult for the defense to keep track of the cutting players and the player who is attempting to drive to the goal. Some players prefer to drive from the midfield positions, as they do not have to turn to shoot, and they are often driving against a short stick defender. Other players prefer to drive from the wings and X, as it is often easier to pass to other players, who are more likely to be facing the goal for an easier shot.\nOther settled offenses.\nThere are other offenses which are commonly used. The second most common offense is probably the 1-4-1, where there is only one midfielder at the top of the field, two midfielders on the crease and two attackmen on the wings, and an attackmen at X. The formation somewhat resembles a cross. This offense is often considered better for driving, because it has a large amount of open space. The offense also allows the two players on the crease to attempt to set picks to get open, and screen the goalie on shots from the outside.\nAnother common offense is known as the \"invert\", and is more commonly used at the college level. This offense is structurally the same as a 2-3-1, but the midfielders and attackmen switch, or invert their positions. This is designed to allow midfielders to drive from the wings and from X against a short-stick midfielder, instead of against a longstick defensemen who would normally defend the player at these positions. It also allows attackmen to drive from the top of the field, where may they have a better chance of scoring, because they are facing the goal.\nHowever, this offense can leave the team open to a fast-break, because when the ball is turned over, the midfielders are very far from their own defensive half. Some teams elect to send their attackmen back to their defensive half if there is a fast break, although this has the obvious disadvantage of forcing a primarily offensive player to play defense.\nAnother offense is the 1-3-2, which is somewhat similar to the 2-3-1 flipped upside down. In this offense, there is one midfielder at the top of the field, two midfielders on the wings and an attackmen on the crease, and two attackmen below the goal line. This offense is designed to allow the attackmen more opportunities to drive from below the goal, and allows the top midfielder a very open field to drive to the goal.\nAnother, less commonly used offense is the 2-2-2. In this offense there are two midfielders at the top left and top right corners, a midfielder and attackmen on the crease, and two attackmen on the bottom right and bottom left corners. This offense resembles an X. This is a very complicated offense, and is quite rare even at the college level. It is designed to allow the crease players to set picks and cut, as in the 1-4-1, as well as allow players to drive from the corners. When properly implemented, it is very difficult to defend. If an individual defender is beaten on a drive, another defender must come from the crease, leaving a player open close to the goal, or from a corner, in which case it may not arrive in time. It is very difficult for the offense, as offensive player must routinely make long passes between the corners, and must all be able to handle the ball competently, as they cannot make a short outlet pass if they get into trouble.\nDefense in settled situations.\nAs in basketball, there are two basic defensive styles: man-to-man and zone. Man-to-man, or simply man defense, is more commonly used in lacrosse. This is due to the lack of a shot clock at most levels of competition, so a man defense will tend to force more turnovers.\nIn a man defense, every defensive player will be responsible for one offensive player, as well as having a support responsibility in the \"slide\" system. A slide is when a defensive player is beaten on a drive, and another player must slide over to stop the player with the ball, and the other defensive players must attempt to cover the uncovered players until the defense is recovered. Teams can use a \"slide from adjacent\" meaning that a defender will have responsibility to stop the driving player if he breaks through on his side; in this system, if the attackmen at X is driving to the right, the defensemen covering the right wing attackman would slide, whereas if he drove left, the defensemen covering the left wing attackmen would slide. The other option is implement a \"slide from the crease\" whereby the defensive player on the crease always slides, and one of the other defenders will pick up his man.\nThe other option is to use a zone defense. The most common, generic defense, is known as a 3-3 (similar to the 2-3 in basketball). The area above the goal line is divided like a rectangle into 6 zones. The long stick defensemen will cover the bottom 3 zones, and the midfielders will cover the top 3 zones. Unlike in most man defenses, defenders do not go very far below the goal line, so often an attackmen at X can simply hold the ball and wait for an open pass. This is why some run four long poles (one LSM) on the corners and have two midfielders in the middle, then when the ball goes to X the low midfielder drops and plays him behind the goal the top midfielder fills into the low position until the ball is moved from X and then the midfielders go back to their original positions in the 3-3.\nOther zone defenses are more tailored to the offense that is being used, such as the 2-3-1 zone, in which the defensive players mirror the offensive players positioning, but when offensive players rotate, they are \"passed off\" to the next zone, rather than being followed as in a man defense system.\nOverall, man defenses are favored as they allow players to strip the ball and attempt to intercept passes more aggressively. However, they also require faster athletes, and it can be difficult to recover when a defender is beaten. As a result, some teams choose to run a zone defense. Zone defenses also can be easier for younger athletes, and are used more commonly at the youth level. Zone defenses can also be used when a team has a large lead, and wants to make sure they opposing team cannot score goals quickly.\nFast-break situations.\nFast breaks occur when an offensive player has the ball, and comes into the defensive half without anyone covering him. Fast breaks usually occur because a player caught an outlet pass from the goalie, won a face-off, or stripped the ball on defense and carries it the other way.\nOne way of aligning for a fast break is the \"L\". In this case, one attackman aligns to the top right, another to the right just above the goal line, and the last on the left just above the goal line, forming an L. The fast break player who is carrying the ball comes into the top left. If the fast break player is coming on the right, then the top attackman will simply switch to the left side. The fast break player will attempt to draw a defensemen, then pass to the top attackmen.\nThe other common way of aligning is in a V. In this case, one attackman is aligned on the crease, and the other two are aligned at top right and top left. The fast break player comes down the middle of the field, and can pass to the left or right. The goal of both fast break offenses is to draw a defensive player, and quickly pass, until a player is uncovered and open for a shot.\nThere is only one commonly used defensive system for fast breaks, the triangle zone. Defensive players begin in a triangle, with one player at the top, or \"point\" and two players low. Once the ball arrives, defensive players will rotate to where the ball is passed, and do everything they can to prevent a goal until help arrives. It is very important that defensemen remain close to the goalie, or it will be easier to get an offensive player open for a shot.\nUnsettled clears.\nThe term \"clear\" refers to when the defense gets the ball in their half of the field, and tries to get the ball across half-field to their offensive zone. The term \"ride\" refers to the efforts of the opposing attackmen and midfielders to recover the ball before it can be brought into their defensive zone.\nWhen the defense gets the ball in an unsettled situation, such as a defensive player picking up a ground ball, intercepting a pass, or the goalie making a save, the defense will try to spread out and try to get open for a pass. When a defensive player picks the ball up behind the goal, or on a far when, they will often pass to the goalie, because the goalie cannot be checked while standing in the crease, and thus has several seconds to look for an open pass. Generally, the defensemen will try to move out to the \"alley\" between the box line and the sideline, and midfielders will try to break upfield and towards the corners, all in an attempt to get a player open, and force the opposing players to spread themselves out.\nThe players who are riding will generally try to harass the player with the ball before he can pass to the goalie or pass upfield, and drop back, generally to around the box line, if they are unsuccessful at doing this. The reason for dropping back to the box line is that the defense has 10 seconds from when they pick the ball up to clear the ball across midfield. This means that the riding players can force a turnover by stripping the ball or intercepting a pass, or by forcing the clearing team to make many passes and take more than 10 seconds in clearing the ball.\nRides and clears in settled situations.\nA settled clear occurs when one team gets the ball in their defensive half of the field after a stoppage in play. Because of the stoppage, both teams will have time to set their players up in an optimal fashion. As a result, teams generally use scripted plays in settled rides and clears.\nOne clear that is commonly used in settled situations is known as an \"L\" clear. In this clear, a midfielder begins with the ball, the goalie is in the middle of the field, one defenseman is in the \"alley\" even with the midfielder, another defensemen is in the top left corner, and the last defensemen is above the box line in the middle of the field. One midfielder is in the top left of the field, and the final midfielder is across the midfield line, above the defenseman.\nThere are several different systems that the riding team may use. In a zone clear, the riding players divide into 6 different zones, with the attackmen generally around the box line, and the midfielders around the half-field line. Zone rides generally aim to force the clearing team to make long passes, or take 20 seconds to cross the half-field line. Zone rides are usually easier for less defensively skilled attackmen, and are less likely to result in fast breaks.\nAnother system is to use man-to-man defense, usually leaving the goalie or a defenseman with weak skills unguarded, and forcing them to bring the ball up on their own. Man-to-man rides often work well with attackmen who are also very good at defense. The danger in this system is that the unguarded player may simply break through and easily clear the ball, or that the man-to-man coverage may be blown, and a fast break given up.\nAn aggressive variation of the man-to-man system is known at the \"ten man ride\". In this system, the riding team's goalie will come out of the goal to cover an attackman, allowing a defenseman to cover a midfielder, which in turn allows a midfielder to cover a defenseman, and finally one of the attackmen to cover the goalie. The danger in this system is that it is possible that none of the clearing midfielders will cross the mid-field line, so that the defenseman will not be able to stay onsides and cover him (remember, teams must always have 4 players on their defensive side of the field). It is also possible that the clearing team may catch the goalie out of the cage, and be able to take an open shot. This riding system is often used when a team is down and needs to recover the ball to catch up.\nMan-up and Man-down.\nMan-up and Man-down, also known as power play, or extra man opportunity (EMO), refers to situations where one team is shorthanded as a result of a penalty. The offensive team attempts to take advantage of their extra player to score a goal, while the defensive team will try to stop them from scoring until they get back to even-handed.\nBecause they are a player short, the defense, called man down defense (MDD), must resort to a zone, and there are several zones they can choose from. One is known as the box-and-one defense, because one defenseman covers the man on the crease, while the other 4 players form a box. This defense is used against an offense with only one player on the crease. Another zone is the 2-3, which is almost exactly like the basketball defense of the same name, with three low zones and 2 higher zones.\nThe offense often chooses to run the same base offense as they run in settled situations, such as a 2-3-1, although offenses with two players on the crease, such as the 1-4-1, are less common. Another common offense that is run in man-up situations is the 3-2-1, also known as the \"circle\" offense, because no player is on the crease, and all of the players are on the perimeter in a circle. Lastly, there is the 3-3 offense, which has no player at X, and 3 midfielders across the top. One drawback to the 3-3 is that, on a shot, there is no attackman at X to back the shot up if it misses the goal.\nA common offensive tactic in man-up situations is the use of the carry, whereby an offensive player carries the ball from one perimeter position to another. This can be disorienting for a defense, because they must \"pass off\" the player to another zone, or else the whole defense must rotate. Often, after a carry, a player may pass back to the position he came from, because there may be a hole there. The offense will also try to draw a defensive player out to them, with the threat of a shot, and make a quick pass in an attempt to get an open shot.\nDefensive strategy centers around staying close to the goal, and not allowing shots from close range. As a result of being a man down, the defense must be less aggressive against long-range shooters, so they may allow long range shots that have a low percentage of scoring. This is similar to allowing a player to shoot a 3-pointer in a basketball fast break: the shot is lower percentage than a close shot, so the defense allows it rather than overplaying the shooter and allowing a layup. Defensive players must also be careful not to be stretched from their zone, by going too high or too far outside, and allow another player to sneak in at the other end of their zone.\nSubstitutions.\nIn lacrosse, substitution can occur in a variety of ways.\nThe primary method for substituting players is through the special substitution box, an area located between the two team benches that allows for on-the-fly substitutions. All on-the-fly substitutions must be through this \"box.\"\nSubstitutions can also be made when the ball goes out on either sideline. In this case, if the coach desires to substitute players, he can ask for a horn to signify this \"regular substitution\". Play is delayed until the team(s) substituting have the players they want on the field. \"Regular substitution\" can also occur after goals are scored and penalties are reported to the scorer's table. These do not need a horn request. However, since 2013, horns no longer exist in the NCAA rules. Since 2014, horns have also been removed from the National-Federation of\nHigh School State Associations rulebook. This means that a coach is no longer allowed to request a horn to make a substitution on a ball out-of-bounds on the sideline. Horns still exist at the youth level, however coaches at other levels have to adapt to playing lacrosse without horns. In addition, the substitution box has been expanded to 20 yards, to allow for increased on-the-fly substitution. The horn is only used for signalling issues at the table that require the officials' attention, such as a player illegally entering the field, and the ends of periods."

        "title": "Rowing on the River Thames",
        "text": "The Thames is one of the main rowing rivers in Europe. Several annual competitions are held along its course, including the Henley Royal Regatta, The Boat Race and other long-distance events, called Head of the River races (Heads).\nAs well as the events held on the river itself, there are other, purpose-built rowing facilities along the course of the river, such as Dorney Lake between Slough and Windsor, Berkshire, which was a 2012 Summer Olympic venue and is now an international Cup, standard-distance rowing lake hosting the three main annual entry regattas for Henley: still named Marlow (International), Wallingford and Metropolitan. Other rowing lakes near the Thames are the Redgrave Pinsent Rowing Lake between Reading and Henley used by the Great Britain squad and Royal Albert Dock near North Woolwich, London.\nHistory.\nRowing races on the River Thames have been documented as early as 1725, and Henley-on-Thames was the venue for the 1908 London Olympics rowing races.\nContemporary events, groups and modern history.\nThe sport and recreational/touring rowing takes place on the Tideway and on the 45 separate lock reaches on the non-tidal section. \nThe river hosts a televised succession of races on which bets are placed – traditionally named The Boat Race and for some decades a men-only event – it is now the (Oxford and Cambridge) Men's and Women's Boat Race on the cusp of March and April. Further up-river, the Henley Royal Regatta, held over six days (Tuesday to Sunday) ending on the first weekend in July is one of several other rowing events held along approximately the same course on that same stretch of the Thames.\nAt least 12 head races are held every year on the long, tidal course of the Boat Race, known as the Championship Course – including \"the Head of the River Race\" which is the weekend before the Boat Race, attracting hundreds of racing shell eights. Head races are, by definition, long time trials. Twice as many \"heads\" are held on long, narrower reaches of the canalised inland river. Many clubs and a few schools and village fair committees as far inland as Oxford host shorter races – regattas – in warmer months. \nEvent-raced, self-propelled boats on the Thames chiefly comprise (Olympic) racing shells. Most events are for racing shells.\nTraditional rowing boats.\nA Thames, or English, punt is a long slender vessel. It sees very few and often intermittent or extremely local races. Its use is almost wholly recreational. Thames skiffs are the mainstay of several regattas and six extant clubs (see below). A large version with a canvas is called a camping skiff, featuring in major modern travelogues and historically in \"Three Men in a Boat\", published in 1889, a humorous account by English writer Jerome K. Jerome of a two-week boating holiday on this river from Kingston upon Thames to Oxford and back to Kingston. Other rowing typically takes place in dragon boats, dongolas, dinghies, inflatable rafts and larger skiffs known as cutters. \nRegattas.\nThames rowing regattas are almost all between April and the first week of September. All but the most prestigious are considered short. They are raced side-by-side. They are in categories for competitors and boat types: each consists of heats (mostly knock-out tournaments, that is, without repechages) and final. Many regatta days are split into two or more \"divisions\" so that competitors can enter two categories – such as a large and small boat, sweep-oar or sculling. Where category events have a cup it belongs to the regatta and is sometimes engraved with winners' club or composite clubs' name (or engraved on metal set around a plinth or set of plinths). Winners receive a medal – or tankard, called by rowers a \"pot\". A regatta in racing shell rowing has umpires/stewards who enforce preparedness (race registration, safety and marshalling time/location rules), false start and lane rules using a motor launch and the wearing of club kit.\n\"General\" refers to a mix of skiffing, cutters, dinghies and other rowed craft.\nHead of the River and long-distance events.\nHead of the River races (Heads) and other long-distance events dominate the winter months, and are usually processional (time trials): competitors set off at time intervals, and results are on the basis of comparative timing or by bumping (catching up the boat in front). Many of them on the Tideway are raced over The Championship Course, and apart from the Boat Race and Wingfield Sculls, may begin from Mortlake (west) or Putney (east) whichever tide matches the middle of the day or other central racing hours.\nClubs.\nRowing on the river is generally organised through clubs based on the Thames, which include the following."

        "text": "This article describes the history of Australian cricket from the 1918–19 season until 1930.\nNotable Australian players during this period include Warwick Armstrong, Charlie Macartney, Warren Bardsley, Jack Gregory, Ted McDonald, Arthur Mailey, Jack Ryder, Herbie Collins, Bert Oldfield, Clarrie Grimmett, Bill Woodfull, Bill Ponsford and the most famous Australian player of all time, Don Bradman, whose career began in the 1920s.\nInternational tours of Australia.\nEngland 1920–21.\nThe Australian team was led by Warwick Armstrong in his first season as the captain of the Australian team. Other team members included Charlie Macartney, Herbie Collins, Warren Bardsley, Charles Kelleway, Jack Gregory, Johnny Taylor, Nip Pellew, Jack Ryder, Bert Oldfield, Ted McDonald and Arthur Mailey.\nThe England touring party included Johnny Douglas (captain), Jack Russell, Jack Hobbs, \"Young\" Jack Hearne, Patsy Hendren, Frank Woolley, Wilfred Rhodes, Bill Hitch, Abe Waddington, Cec Parkin and Bert Strudwick.\nThe tour was the first after the First World War to include Test matches, and it was the first Test series ever in which one side won all five matches. This feat was not repeated in an Ashes series until 2006–07.\nMCC 1922–23.\nAn English cricket team raised by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) toured Australia and New Zealand in the winter of 1922–23 season. Seven first-class matches were played in Australia versus New South Wales (twice), South Australia (twice), Victoria (twice) and Western Australia (once).\nThe MCC team was captained by Archie MacLaren and included Tich Freeman, Freddie Calthorpe, Percy Chapman and Clement Gibson.\nNew Zealand 1925–26.\nThe New Zealand national cricket team made its third tour of Australia in 1925–26 and played four first-class matches against each of the main Australian state teams.\nNew Zealand lost by an innings to Queensland in the opening match but then managed to draw the other three games against Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales.\nNew Zealand 1927–28.\nThe New Zealand team that toured England in the 1927 season played one first-class match against New South Wales in late October on their way back to New Zealand. After a fairly successful tour of England, and in the light of the Imperial Cricket Conference decision in 1926 to extend Test cricket to new teams outside the existing triumvirate of England, Australia and South Africa, the New Zealanders were keen for international experience. \nThe match in Sydney did not help their cause. New South Wales scored 571 at more than two runs a minute. Bill Merritt, the bowling star of the England tour, took five wickets in just over 23 overs, but they came at a cost of 218 runs. For the state side, Jack Gregory, Tommy Andrews, Alan Kippax and Archie Jackson all scored centuries. The New Zealanders scored 286 and 292 in reply, many batsmen getting a good start but no one exceeding Roger Blunt's first-innings 63. New South Wales needed eight to win and all the runs came in byes or leg-byes. The game was the first-class debut of Bill O'Reilly: he took three wickets.\nMCC 1929–30.\nThe main purpose of this tour was a four-match Test series in New Zealand, but the England team began the tour in October 1929 in Australia where they played first-class matches versus each of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia.\nThe team was captained by Arthur Gilligan and included Frank Woolley, Duleep and Stan Nichols."

        "title": "Clemson Tigers men's basketball",
        "text": "The Clemson Tigers men's basketball team is a college basketball program that represents Clemson University and competes in the NCAA Division I. Clemson is a founding member of the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nClemson sponsored its first men's basketball team in 1911–12, winning its first conference championship in 1939 and the ACC regular season in 1990. The Tigers have never won the ACC basketball tournament since its inception in 1953. The Tigers have reached the NCAA tournament 14 times in the modern era (1980, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2018, 2021, 2024) since the tournament expansion in 1980, advancing to the NCAA Sweet 16 five times (1980, 1990, 1997, 2018, 2024), with their best performance reaching the Elite Eight twice in 1980 and 2024.\nClemson's home court is Littlejohn Coliseum. It has been the scene of 55 Clemson wins over ranked teams (23 in the Top 10) since 1968, including a victory over #1 Duke in 1980, a 75–65 victory over #1 North Carolina in 2001, and a 74–47 victory over #3 Duke in 2009. The Clemson basketball programs have won roughly 75% of their games in Littlejohn, making it one of the ACC's toughest road venues.\nClemson's current head coach is Brad Brownell.\nTeam history.\nClemson's basketball history had an unusual beginning. The Tigers' first two basketball games were both played in Greenville, South Carolina on February 9, 1912, a 46–12 win at Furman, followed by a 78–6 victory over the Butler Guards later that evening. Brothers John and Frank Erwin scored a combined 74 points in their second game; John Erwin's 58 points still stand as Clemson's single-game scoring record, unique in college basketball for not being broken in over a century since the program's inaugural day. Clemson won its first seven games in the program's history, the longest streak to open a program among the current 15 ACC schools. Former Pittsburgh Nationals player Frank Dobson was Clemson's first basketball coach, taking the Tigers to a 13–5 record in the first two seasons.\nSouthern Conference: The Tigers began play in the Southern Conference in 1921, and 1922–23 had an 11–6 finish. Josh Cody coached for five seasons, the longest tenure for a Clemson Basketball coach in the first 25 years. In 1928–29, the Tigers won 15 games, a school record, and then followed that with a 16–9 mark. Cody pulled off the first huge upset in Clemson basketball history when the Tigers defeated Adolph Rupp's 10–1 Kentucky Wildcats, 29–26, at Clemson on Valentine's Day in 1931. From 1931 to 1940, Joe Davis coached Clemson to 101 victories, including 44 wins on the road. Davis still has the best winning percentage in Clemson history on the road and led the Tigers to a 15–3 (.833) mark in 1934–35. In the 1938–39 season, the Tigers won 10 of their last 11 games to close the regular season. Banks McFadden, eventual All-American in both football and basketball, averaged 11.8 points per game to lead the team as the starting pivot to four victories. It was an incredible run in the tournament as Clemson beat North Carolina, 44–43, Wake Forest, 30–28, Davidson 49–33 and Maryland 39–27 to clinch the Southern Conference title. McFadden's best year as coach was the 1951–52 season when the Tigers were 17–7 overall and 11–4 in the Conference.\nAtlantic Coast Conference.\nIn 1953, Clemson became a founding member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. In the 1954–55 season, Bill Yarborough averaged 28.3 points per game, 4th best in the nation and best in the ACC. In 1958, Vince Yockel became the first Clemson player to make first-team All-ACC. Press Maravich, father of basketball legend Pete Maravich, coached the Tigers to a 96–94 double overtime victory against a #8 NC State team. Jim Brennan became the first Clemson player to make the first-team All-ACC Tournament in 1962 with 34 points against #8 Duke in the semifinals before losing to Billy Packer and the Wake Forest Demon Deacons, 77–66. In 1963–64, coach Bobby Roberts guided the Tigers to an 8–6 record in the ACC. The season included the only regular season sweep of North Carolina in school history. Roberts beat the Tar Heels and Dean Smith, 66–64, in double overtime at Clemson to open the season and beat them again, 97–90, in double overtime in Charlotte at the North–South Doubleheader. In 1966–67. Clemson won seven straight ACC games, including consecutive wins over Wake Forest, #14 Duke, North Carolina State and #4 North Carolina. It was the first sweep of \"the North Carolina ACC schools\" in ACC history. Clemson finished with a 17–8 record and a 9–5 record in the ACC. Randy Mahaffey was a first-team All-ACC selection who became Clemson's first professional player. His teammate Jim Sutherland averaged 17 points a game and was the first Clemson athlete in any sport to win the Jim Weaver Award as the ACC's top scholar-athlete.\nIn the 1970s, Tree Rollins ushered in a new era in Clemson basketball when he matriculated to Tigertown for the 1973–74 season. He changed the image of Clemson basketball more than any other player. At 7–2, he was a shot-blocking phenomenon who burst on the national scene in his second game when he had 22 points, 20 rebounds and nine blocked shots against St. John's. Rollins started 110 games in a row, which was a national record then. His sophomore year, 1974–75, he joined forces with Skip Wise to take Clemson to its first top 20 final ranking and its first postseason NIT tournament bid. The Tigers defeated 3rd ranked Maryland, 10th ranked North Carolina and 4th ranked NC State at home. Wise was named first-team All-ACC and the first true freshman in league history to obtain that honor.\nBill Foster.\nIn 1975, Bill Foster was brought in to build the program further. He had an impeccable reputation and came from a UNC Charlotte program he helped advance. When Tree Rollins decided not to turn professional, Foster coached the Tigers to a 22–6 record, the program's ninth straight year with an improved winning percentage. Before his final game, Rollins had his #30 jersey retired, the first athlete in Clemson history so honored. It was a fitting way to honor Rollins, who averaged a double-double for four years and is still first in ACC history in blocked shots, before starting his 18-year career in the NBA. Bill Foster did a remarkable job in keeping Clemson at a winning level. He won 100 games in his first 147, still fifth in ACC history in terms of the fewest games required to get 100 wins. He could find diamonds in the rough that kept Clemson competitive in the ACC: Bobby Conrad, Horace Grant, Harvey Grant, &amp; Larry Nance an eventual All-West regional choice in the 1980 NCAA tournament and NBA All-Star. Foster's 1979–80 team defeated six top 20 teams during the year, including #1 ranked Duke on January 9, 1980, in overtime, 87–82. Clemson went to the NCAA Tournament defeating Danny Ainge and BYU in Round 2 before being eliminated by Larry Brown and UCLA in the Elite Eight.\nCliff Ellis.\nCliff Ellis became the winningest coach in Clemson basketball history on a total victories basis (177–128). He took the Tigers to eight post-season tournaments, including three NCAA tournaments. He coached a record 25-win season in 1987, with ACC Player of the Year and future NBA champion Horace Grant. Ellis coached Clemson to the ACC regular season title in 1990, with the Tigers posting a 24–8 record that year behind Dale Davis and Elden Campbell, ending in a last-second shot by UConn in the Sweet 16. Ellis set 33 Clemson coaching records, including ACC regular season victories, victories at home and home winning percentage. The Tigers won 22 games over the top 25 teams in Ellis' ten years at Clemson, including an upset of 12th-ranked Florida State in the 1993 ACC Tournament and a victory over #2 North Carolina in 1994. Ellis was also named ACC Coach-of-the-Year in 1987 and 1990, the only Clemson coach to win that award.\nRick Barnes.\nRick Barnes was the first coach in Clemson history to take the Tigers to the NCAA Tournament three consecutive years. Barnes coached Clemson into post-season play every year of his tenure and to the NCAA in 1996, 1997, and 1998. The Tigers' top season was his third year, when he coached the Tigers to a 16–1 start and a #2 national ranking. In the season, he opened with a 79–71 overtime victory against defending National Champion Kentucky. The team ended the season 23–10 and ranked #8 in the final USA Today poll. Picked last in the ACC before his first season, he shocked the basketball world by winning his first ten games, including a 75–70 victory over 9th-ranked Duke in Cameron Indoor Stadium. In his second season, he featured an 18–11 record, including Clemson's first-ever ACC Tournament victory over #20 North Carolina. The Tigers were ranked fifth in the nation in the preseason poll of 1997–1998, an example of the level of respect that Barnes had brought back to the program. His fiery on-the-floor interactions with Dean Smith and the teams' physical style of play made him a basketball fan favorite. Clemson defeated three top-25 teams in 1997–1998, including sixth-ranked South Carolina. Barnes concluded his four years with a 74–48 record, a 60.7 percent winning mark before leaving for the University of Texas.\nLarry Shyatt.\nBarnes' assistant Larry Shyatt, who was a part of Clemson's success in the three seasons prior, took over as head coach for five seasons from 1998 to 2003. Shyatt led the Tigers to a 20-win season in his first season (20–15). The Tigers advanced to the 1999 NIT Championship Game before losing to California by one point, 60–61. At the time, Shyatt became only the fourth first-year coach in Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) history to guide his team to a 20-win season. Also during his time as head coach at Clemson, the 2000–01 team set a school record for three-point field goals in a season and recorded one of the biggest wins in school history with a 75–65 win over No. 1 ranked North Carolina on February 18, 2001, ending an 18-game winning streak for the Tar Heels.\nOliver Purnell.\nAfter several lackluster seasons and renovations to Littlejohn Coliseum, Oliver Purnell rebuilt the program steadily, improving each subsequent season. The trademark of Purnell's teams was full-court pressure defense. In 2008, he guided the Tigers to a third-place 10–6 record in the Atlantic Coast Conference and a runner-up position in the ACC Tournament in Charlotte, losing to North Carolina by 5 points. The 2008–09 season was record-breaking on many fronts. Purnell's team finished with a 23–9 record, a .719 winning percentage, and a No. 24 final ranking in the Associated Press poll. Clemson's victims that season were #3 Duke, who lost to the #10 Tigers by a score of 74–47 at Littlejohn Coliseum. It was the largest margin of victory ever for Clemson against a ranked opponent. Coaching players such as Cliff Hammonds, K.C. Rivers, and Trevor Booker, Purnell finished with a record of 138–88 and guided the Tigers to 3 NCAA appearances.\nBrad Brownell.\nBrad Brownell is the current Clemson head basketball coach. In his first season in 2010, Brownell guided the Tigers to a 4th-place ACC finish and a 2nd-round finish in the NCAA Tournament and set a record with 22 wins (9 ACC), the most ever by a rookie coach. Jerai Grant and Demontez Stitt became the first scholarship players in school history to be consistent contributors to four straight NCAA Tournament teams. Brownell's second team went 16–15 and 8–8 in ACC play, a record fifth straight season the Tigers were .500 or better in conference games, defeating three teams that advanced to the NCAA Tournament, including NC State. In 2013, the Tigers suffered a 13–18 overall record. Still, they were impressive in several statistical categories, yielding just 60.1 points per game, finishing 2nd in the ACC in Scoring Defense, and setting a record for fewest turnovers. Brownell's defensive style continued to stifle teams into the 2014 season, as the Tigers, led by blocking and scoring leader K. J. McDaniels, was ranked 2nd in the nation in Scoring Defense (56.8 ppg), which helped elevate Clemson to a 72–59 upset of #16 Duke on January 11. The Tigers were seeded 6th in the 2014 ACC tournament and advanced to the semifinals of the NIT at Madison Square Garden. On January 16, 2016, the Clemson Tigers defeated #8 Miami, marking the first time Clemson has defeated three consecutive top-25 opponents. In the two games prior, Clemson defeated #16 Louisville and #9 Duke. Brownell was announced after the 2016–2017 season to stay as Clemson's head coach with a contract extension until 2021. \nIn 2017–18 the Tigers went 25-10 (9-9) and Brownell and the Tigers made their first appearance in the NCAA tournament since 2010–11. Clemson would beat #12 seed New Mexico State 79–68 and #4 seed Auburn 84–53 before losing to #1 seeded Kansas 80–76. In the 2019–20 season, the Tigers beat #3 Duke at home and North Carolina back to back and won in Chapel Hill for the first time. The Tigers also beat #5 Louisville and #6 Florida State, finished with a 16–15 (9–11) record, and finished 9th in the ACC. \nThe 2023-2024 season proved to be one of the most successful seasons in Clemson history. Led by All-ACC selection PJ Hall and senior guard Chase Hunter, the team boasted ranked non-conference wins over in-state rival South Carolina and Alabama, the latter coming in the ACC—SEC Challenge. Clemson also achieved their second-ever win in Chapel Hill over #3 UNC, the second highest-ranked road win in history for the Tigers, second only to Clemson's win over #2 Maryland in 1976. The Tigers earned a 6 seed in the ACC tournament, only to fall in their first game to 12 seed Boston College. The Tigers were selected for their first NCAA tournament appearance since 2021, as a 6 seed. Rebounding from their disappointing ACC tournament finish, the Tigers earned their first Elite Eight appearance since 1980, beating three favored teams in 11 seed New Mexico, 3 seed Baylor, and 2 seed Arizona before falling to 4-seed Alabama in the Elite Eight. Clemson's 2024 Elite Eight finish is Brownell's best as a head coach, and Clemson's best finish since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Tigers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 14 times. Their combined record is 14–14.^*\nNIT results.\nThe Tigers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 18 times. Their combined record is 19–18."

        "text": "The New Mexico State Aggies men's basketball team represents New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, New Mexico. Founded in 1904, the Aggies compete in Conference USA after spending 18 seasons in the Western Athletic Conference from 2005 through 2023. The Aggies, who last played in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in 2022, are one of 34 college basketball teams with multiple NBA retired jerseys from former players (Sam Lacey and John Williamson) and a team that reached the NCAA Final Four (in 1970). The team plays home games in the Pan American Center.\nA Lou Henson-coached team gained national attention during the 1970 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament by advancing to the Final Four. In 1992, a Neil McCarthy-coached team advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, though that appearance has since been vacated. Aggie Basketball has seen 26 NCAA tournament appearances, 5 NIT Tournament appearances, 21 regular season conference championships, and 13 conference tournament championships.\nHistory.\nNMSU Basketball has seen much success throughout the years, reaching the NCAA Final Four in 1970, the Sweet Sixteen in 1992 among their 23 tournament appearances. Their two most successful coaches were Lou Henson and Neil McCarthy.\nJerry Hines era (1929–1940, '46).\nJerry Hines was an outstanding two-sport athlete, the head basketball and head football coach, and the athletic director. During the later 1930s, the Aggie football team was 31–10–6 and the basketball team was 102–36 under Hines. The Aggie basketball team went to several postseason tournaments during this time, including the 1938 NAIA Division I men's basketball tournament, and the 1939 National Invitation Tournament in New York City. The Hines era ended at the onset of World War II when he was called to duty in September 1940 as a member of a New Mexico National Guard unit assigned to the 45 Infantry Division. Hines did return for one more Aggie basketball season in 1946–47.\nLou Henson era (1966–1975).\nLou Henson played for the Aggies in the 1950s, coached at Las Cruces High School, and came from Hardin-Simmons University to become the head coach. His tenure was the most successful in Aggie history. His 1970 team reached the NCAA tournament Final Four, losing to a John Wooden-coached and eventual champion, UCLA.\nHenson led the Aggies to the NCAA tournament in six of his nine years. He left in 1975 for a successful 21-year run at Illinois.\nNeil McCarthy (1985–1997).\nNeil McCarthy came to Las Cruces in 1985 following a successful 10-year run at Weber State. He had built Weber State into a regional power, and was equally successful at New Mexico State. For most of McCarthy's tenure, the Aggies were the second-best team in the Big West, behind UNLV. McCarthy led the Aggies to four straight regular season and tournament titles, including the 1992 Sweet Sixteen run.\nAcademic Scandal.\nThe 1992 Sweet Sixteen run, along with two other NCAA runs in the early 1990s, was scrubbed from the books in 1996 when the NCAA found several players from that team received help on correspondence courses from a coach. Six Aggie players were found to have received help. Without those courses, the players would not have been eligible.\nThe McCarthy era came to a sudden and abrupt end just weeks before the 1997–98 season when new athletic director Jim Paul stripped him of coaching duties, citing the team's poor academic performance. Only nine of McCarthy's players had graduated in 12 years, including only one in the last four. McCarthy was originally supposed to serve as an assistant athletic director for the balance of his contract, but instead sued NMSU for wrongful termination—a move that would come back to haunt the school later.\nIn 2000, the Aggies were rocked again by a scandal from the McCarthy era. McCarthy had promised to hire a junior college coach as an assistant coach in return for bringing two of his top players to Las Cruces. That coach, Fletcher Cockrell, helped the two players with coursework and exams. The school placed the basketball program on two years' probation and withdrew from postseason consideration during the 2000–01 season. The NCAA imposed an additional four years' probation and forced the Aggies to vacate McCarthy's last season and the first season of Henson's second stint. The NCAA said that the penalties would have been even harsher if the school's former president, the former athletic director and McCarthy had still been at the school.\nLou Henson's 2nd run (1997–2004).\nHenson was lured from retirement to coach the team on an interim basis for the 1997–98 season after McCarthy's ouster. He initially came back because he wanted to help the Aggies during their search for a new head coach. Henson wanted to donate his time, but state law forbade him from coaching the program for free. He ultimately settled for $1 per month. The following season Henson agreed to stay on as head coach on a permanent basis, leading the Aggies back to the NCAA tournament in 1999.\nHenson continued to coach the Aggies until being sidelined by non-Hodgkin lymphoma prior to the 2004–05 season. Due to Henson's illness the Aggies were led that year by assistant coach Tony Stubblefield, who guided the squad to a dismal 6–24 record, by far the school's worst season in twenty years. Henson officially announced his retirement from coaching in January 2005, and Stubblefield remained interim head coach for the remainder of the season.\nReggie Theus (2005–2007).\nOn March 31, 2005, NMSU hired 13-year NBA veteran Reggie Theus, then an assistant at Louisville under Rick Pitino, as head men's basketball coach. In his first season, Theus turned the Aggies from a 6–24 squad in 2004–05 to a 16–14 team in the 2005–06 season as the Aggies moved from the Sun Belt Conference to the Western Athletic Conference. In Theus's second year the Aggies finished the regular season at 22–8, won the WAC Tournament on their home floor, and earn an automatic bid to the 2007 NCAA tournament. Following the tournament Theus left NMSU to take over the head coaching position of the NBA's Sacramento Kings.\nMarvin Menzies (2007–2016).\nMarvin Menzies was named as Theus' successor, and like Theus before him, came to NMSU after having been an assistant to Pitino and had no previous Division I head coaching experience. In 2010 the Aggies again won the WAC Tournament and advanced to the NCAA tournament, falling 70–67 in the first round to eventual Final Four participant Michigan State. In 2012 the Aggies once again advanced to the NCAA tournament by winning the WAC Tournament for the third time in six seasons. They continued to appear in the NCAA tournament through 2015. After their 2016 NIT tournament appearance, Marvin Menzies was hired to take over the Nevada-Las Vegas (UNLV) basketball program.\nPaul Weir (2016–2017).\nPaul Weir served in the role of associate head coach from July 2011 until he was promoted to head coach on April 26, 2016. He helped the Aggies to five WAC Tournament Championships (2010, 2012–2015) and five NCAA tournament appearances. The Aggies have collected three WAC Championships during Weir's tenure. The Aggies have won back-to-back WAC regular season titles in 2015 and 2016 after collecting their first WAC regular season title in 2008. Overall, NM State has collected seven WAC titles during his nine years with the program. Weir left after one season to coach the New Mexico Lobos, a rival of the Aggies.\nChris Jans (2017–2022).\nFormer Bowling Green head coach Chris Jans was named the new head coach of the Aggies on April 17, 2017. He had been serving in an administrative role at Wichita State after being fired from BGSU in 2015 and was promoted to associate head coach of the Shockers just 4 days prior to being hired by NMSU. In his first season at NMSU, The Aggies won 28 games for the second year in a row, and won both the WAC regular season title and conference championship to advance to the NCAA tournament, where they lost to Clemson in the first round. In 2022 New Mexico State won a first round NCAA tournament game against University of Connecticut, before losing to Arkansas. Jans was hired by Mississippi State after the 2022 season.\nGreg Heiar (2022–2023).\nGreg Heiar was named the head coach of the Aggies on March 28, 2022. He was formerly the head coach at Northwest Florida State College, where he won the 2022 NJCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship. On February 14, 2023, Greg Heiar was removed as the head coach of New Mexico State men's basketball team due to hazing allegations.\nCoaches.\nThe Aggies have had 27 coaches in their 110-year history. Six Aggie coaches have been named conference Coach-of-the-Year: Lou Henson in 1975, Ken Hayes in 1977, and Weldon Drew in 1983 in the Missouri Valley Conference; Neil McCarthy in 1989 and 1990 in the Big West Conference; Marvin Menzies in 2015, and Chris Jans in 2018, 2019 and 2020 in the Western Athletic Conference.\nPostseason Results.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe Aggies have appeared in 26 NCAA tournaments. Their combined record is 11–27.\nNCAA tournament seeding history.\n\"The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\"\nNAIA tournament.\nThe Aggies have appeared in four NAIA Tournaments. Their combined record is 5–4.\nNational Invitational tournament.\nThe Aggies have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) five times. Their combined record is 2–5.\nAggies of note.\nRing of Honor.\nNew Mexico State's men's basketball Ring of Honor stands as a tribute to individual players and coaches that are distinguished as Aggie legends. A player's number is retired upon reaching this milestone. A banner designating this honor is hung from the rafters in the Pan American Center.\nLou Henson – began his coaching career with the Aggies in 1966, eventually coaching the Aggies to 289 victories over 17 years. Henson finished with 779 victories including his wins at Illinois. Henson coached the Aggies to the Final Four and two Sweet Sixteens among the 10 NCAA tournament appearances. His career Aggie record is 289–152, which is the winningest in Aggie history.\nSam Lacey (#44) – played for the Aggies from 1967 to 1970, including a trip to the Final Four. Lacey is 11th in Aggie all-time scoring and holds most rebounding records. He was a 1st Team All-American in 1970 and played in the NBA for 13 seasons, well enough to get his #44 jersey retired by the Sacramento Kings.\nBilly Joe Price (#31) – played from 1957 to 1961, including two trips to the NCAA tournament. Price is 15th on the all-time scoring list and among the career leaders in rebounding.\nJimmy Collins (#22) – played for the Aggies from 1967 to 1970 and helped them to the Final Four in 1970. Collins holds the Aggie season scoring record and rank 3rd all-time in career scoring. Collins played in the NBA for several seasons.\nJohn Williamson (#24) – is the most prolific scorer in Aggie history, averaging over 27 points per game during the 1971–72 and 1972–73 seasons.

        "title": "Uniform number (American football)",
        "text": "In American football, uniform numbers are displayed on both the front and back of the jersey, and in many cases the sleeves, shoulder pad, or occasionally helmets. The numbers on the front and back are very large, covering most of the jersey. Certain numbers may only be worn by players in specific positions, thus assisting the officials in determining penalties.\nAt all levels of football, each player dressed for a game must wear a unique number from 0 to 99. The number 0, long prohibited in American football, has been permitted in college football since 2020 and in the National Football League since the 2023 season.\nPlayers who wear numbers from 50 to 79 are, by rule, prohibited from catching or touching forward passes if their team is in possession of the ball and may not line up in a position that allows them to do so, unless explicitly indicated to the referee during a tackle-eligible play. Other than this, the correspondence between jersey numbers and player positions is largely a matter of style, tradition and semantics.\nCanadian football follows a similar numbering scheme to that of American football, except that the ineligible numbers span only 50 to 69 and numbers 0 and 00 have long been available for use, although beginning in the 2023 CFL season a Canadian Football League team is not permitted to simultaneously issue both. 00 remains prohibited in American football.\nProfessional football.\nThe National Football League numbering system dates from a large-scale change of their rules in 1973, subsequently amended in various minor ways. As of 2023, players are generally required to wear numbers within ranges based on their positions as shown in the following table.\nExceptions to this system do exist, including during the National Football League preseason with associated larger team rosters. The numbers used relate to the player's primary position when they are first assigned a number. If they later change positions, they can keep their prior number, unless it conflicts with the eligible receiver rule; that is only players that change positions from an eligible position (such as receiver or back) to an ineligible position (such as an offensive lineman) are required to change numbers if they change position. Additionally, during a game a player may play out-of-position, but only after reporting in to the referees, who will announce to the stadium that a specific player number has reported in (for example \"Number 61 has reported as an eligible receiver\") to alert the opposing team, other officials, and the audience that a player is legally out-of-position.\nAlthough the NFL does allow teams to retire jersey numbers, the league officially discourages the practice for fear of teams running out of numbers; the rule book requires teams to make available retired numbers for new players should they exhaust all available numbers at a particular position.\nIn the XFL, the NFL numbering conventions were followed with a slight exception being that wide-receivers are allowed to wear single-digit numbers (i.e. 1–9); the NFL itself added that allowance starting in 2021.\nNCAA.\nAccording to NCAA rule book, Rule 1 Section 4 Article 1 \"strongly recommends\" numbering as follows for offensive players:\nOtherwise all players can be numbered 0–99; the NCAA makes no stipulation on defensive players. Two players may also share the same number, although they may not play during the same down.\nStarting in the 2020 NCAA football season, the use of duplicate numbers was restricted to only two players on a team, and players were allowed to wear No. 0.\nTwo players, both placekickers, have worn No. 100 in NCAA history. Both did so as part of centennial celebrations in the 1960s, with special dispensation from the NCAA: West Virginia's Chuck Kinder (not the writer of the same name), who did so in 1963 to commemorate the state of West Virginia's 100th anniversary, and Kansas' Bill Bell, who did so in 1969 to commemorate 100 years since the first organized college football contest.\nHigh school.\nOn high school and other lower youth teams, jerseys with different number ranges are different sizes, and since many of these teams do not reorder jerseys every year, players are often assigned numbers based more on jerseys that fit them rather than specific position. Permian High School (of \"Friday Night Lights\" fame) in Odessa, Texas plays in the one state which uses NCAA rules for high school football; yet Permian's tradition is that quarterbacks will wear numbers in the 20s unlike most schools in college or high school.\nAlthough previous editions of the National Federation of State High School Associations rule book indicated a recommended numbering system nearly identical to the NCAA's, later editions from approximately 2000 onward only indicate the bare minimum requirements: offensive linemen must be numbered from 50 to 79, while all other positions including backs and ends must wear numbers either from 0 to 49 or 80 to 99. The number 0 was made legal in 2022, although it remains banned as the first digit of a two-digit number.\nIn forms of the game that have fewer than 11 men (most notably eight-man football and six-man football) a player can wear any number. In eight-man, there are only three ineligible receivers and in six-man, all players are eligible receivers.\nIn popular culture.\nUnusual uniform numbers have been used in comedy films, including:"

        "text": "The 1987 Ice Hockey World Championships was the 52nd such event hosted by the International Ice Hockey Federation. It was also the 63rd European Championships. Teams representing 28 countries participated in four levels of competition.\nIn the Division A Championship held 17 April to 3 May in Vienna, Austria, each team played each other once in the preliminary round. The four best placed teams then played each other once in a championship round and, unlike the relegation round, the first round of results were not counted. Sweden won the gold medal for the fourth time and the Soviet Union won their 25th European title. In the European Championships, only the games of the first round between European teams counted. Switzerland was demoted to Division B.\nSweden's victory was a controversial one. The Germans had beaten both Canada and Finland when it was revealed that forward Miroslav Sikora had played for the Polish junior team in 1977. He was suspended and the IIHF stripped West Germany of their two wins. The Germans took the matter to court, stating that they had been granted permission. Though Sikora remained suspended, the IIHF reinstated the two victories. If the courts had not intervened, Finland would have replaced Sweden in the medal round. Additionally, the Swedes earned the Gold over the Soviets by goal differential when the Soviets had gone undefeated and the Swedes had lost three preliminary round games. This led to further discussion of a change of format. The IIHF's account of the finale states that, \"Sweden won thanks to an inflated score against Canada,\" however Sweden only needed to win by two (the same margin that the Czechoslovaks beat Canada by) for the Gold. In reality the Soviets had to come from behind to capture Silver and deprive the Czechoslovaks of the Gold, and the Swedes winning by more than two ensured that the Czechoslovaks could not play to a tie and capture Gold.\nPromotion and relegation was effective for 1989 as the IIHF did not run a championship in Olympic years at this time. Nations that did not participate in the Calgary Olympics were invited to compete in the final Thayer Tutt Trophy.\nWorld Championship Group A (Austria).\nConsolation round.\n\"Switzerland was relegated to Group B.\"\nWorld Championship Group B (Italy).\nPlayed in Canazei 26 March to 5 April.

In addition to being promoted, the winner played off against the fourth placed Group B team for the final Olympic berth.\nBoth Japan and Denmark were promoted to Group B. On the final day, if either Romania or Yugoslavia had won, they would have been promoted, but they tied each other. Belgium was relegated to Group D, and later Romania chose to compete in Group D as well, for financial reasons.\nWorld Championship Group D (Australia).\nPlayed in Perth, Western Australia 13–20 March. Chinese Taipei also played four games as exhibition contests. They lost 31–3 to Australia, 24–0 to South Korea, 12–1 to New Zealand, and tied Hong Kong 2–2.\nAustralia was promoted to Group C.

His best performances came in the 2007 Windy City Open in Chicago and the 2007 UK Open Irish Regional where he reached the quarter-finals. He also made it to the last 16 of the 2007 Peachtree Open and 2007 Hayling Island PDPA Players Championship.\nHis consistency on the Pro Tour during 2007 saw him qualify for the 2008 PDC World Darts Championship for the first time. He was the fifth highest ranked player on the Pro Tour of those who had not sealed an automatic place in the tournament. Having started the year at 613 in the world rankings—he had climbed to 76th by November. He lost to Chris Mason in the first round.\nBrown next qualified for the World Championship in 2010, losing 1-3 to James Wade in the first round. 2010 was a breakthrough year for Brown, as he reached the second round of both the World Matchplay and the World Grand Prix. He also reached the second round of the 2011 PDC World Darts Championship, defeating Jelle Klaasen to secure a second-round match with Terry Jenkins, which he lost 4-1.\nBrown won his first PDC Pro Tour event in February 2011, defeating Ian White 6-3 in the final of UK Open Qualifier 1. In April, he climbed into the top 32 of the PDC Order of Merit for the first time.\nAt the 2012 World Championship Brown lost in the first round to South Africa's preliminary qualifier Devon Petersen 3–2 in sets, having led 2–1 and had a dart at the bullseye to win the match. In the rest of 2012, Brown performed well in the five new European Tour events by qualifying for four of them. He lost in the last 64 once, the last 32 twice and saved his best run for the final event, the Dutch Darts Masters where he defeated Dick van Dijk 6–5 and Wes Newton 6–2, before losing to Mark Walsh 6–3 in the last 16.\nIt was largely thanks to these results that he reached the 2013 World Championship by finishing 41st on the ProTour Order of Merit, taking the 11th of 16 spots that were awarded to the highest non-qualified players. Brown lost to Terry Jenkins 0–3 in the first round. After the tournament, Brown was ranked world number 36. He lost 5–4 to Adrian Gray in the first round of the 2013 UK Open. At the fifth Players Championship of the year, Brown threw a nine-dart finish during a 6–2 second round win over Connie Finnan, but lost 6–0 to Joe Cullen in the next round. At the Gibraltar Darts Trophy he hit six doubles from eight attempts to defeat Brendan Dolan 6–4 and then beat Paul Nicholson 6–3, before being whitewashed 6–0 by youngster Jamie Lewis in the third round. He reached the same stage of the German Darts Championship with impressive 6–2 wins over both Gary Anderson and Ian White, but lost by a reverse of this scoreline to Richie Burnett. These two results made up almost half of Brown's prize money in 2013 and he earned the final spot for the 2014 World Championship through the ProTour Order of Merit. Brown played 27th seed Andy Smith in the opening round and missed one dart to take a 2–0 set lead. In the third set Brown wired a dart at double 12 to fall agonisingly close to hitting the third nine-dart finish of the event. He did get the double in his next visit to take the leg in 10 darts but this was the last leg he could win in the match as he was beaten 3–1. He dropped 10 places over the course of the year to begin 2014 ranked world number 46.\nBrown lost 5–4 to Ewan Hyslop in the first round of the 2014 UK Open and had to wait until the penultimate Players Championship of the year to reach the last 16 for the only time this season. He knocked out Dave Ladley, James Wade and Jelle Klaasen, before Adrian Lewis defeated him 6–3.\nIn 2015 he missed out on qualifying for the UK Open for the first time since 2006. He won the Southern Counties Open with a 6–5 victory over Andy Jenkins. Brown had a poor year on the Pro Tour as he only reached the last 32 on two occasions.\nBrown had to enter Q School in 2016 as he had dropped out of the top 64 on the Order of Merit. He reached the last 16 on the second day but overall did not do enough to secure a tour card, giving him a limited selection of events for the year ahead. He didn't qualify for the UK Open, but at the sixth Players Championship he beat Joe Cullen, James Richardson, Antonio Alcinas, James Wilson and Simon Whitlock to reach the semi-finals of an event for the first time in nearly five years. He was defeated 6–3 by Josh Payne. Brown also got to the last 32 and last 16 in two other events to qualify for the Players Championship Finals, where he will play Mensur Suljović.\nOn 19 January 2020, Brown regained his PDC Tour Card by finishing tenth on the UK Q School Order of Merit. He will play on the ProTour in 2020 and 2021.\nOutside of darts.\nBrown began taking up darts around 1995, and prior to becoming a full-time professional, he made his living as a plasterer. He is a fan of Bristol City and is married with four children. His son, John Brown, joined him on the PDC Pro Tour after winning a Tour Card at the 2021 Q-School.\nThe darts that Steve Brown is now using are 22 gram custom-made Laserdarts. Horizon Darts, Inc (USA), makers of Laserdarts, is one of Steve's sponsors.\nIn 2010 Brown also founded the Steve Brown Darts Academy for kids between the ages of 8 and 16 with multiple venues across the UK. This has now become the Junior Darts Corporation and it is officially partnered with the PDC."

Later in 1994, Brown also reached the semi-finals of the WDC Greene King U.K. Masters in Bury St. Edmunds.\nHaving played league darts from the age of 13, Brown made his debut for the Surrey County 'B' Team (in the British Inter-Counties League) in September 1978. After three years struggling to hold down a team place, he joined the London County squad in 1981, and by 1983, had become established in the London 'A' Team. In 1989 Brown received the great honour of being appointed London Team Captain, following in the footsteps of such illustrious names as Eric Bristow, Cliff Lazarenko, and Clive Pearce.\nHis first World-Ranked titles came in 1988 with wins at the Dutch Open and North American Open (which he retained the following year). Another particularly successful year was 1991, when he won the Swiss Open and Darts America, and also reached the final of the French Open, Malta Open and German Open. He was also a semi-finalist at the Belgium Open and a quarter-finalist in the Dutch Open. Despite this success, he never competed at the World Championship until the devastating split in the game. That was when the PDC (then known as the World Darts Council) field was boosted by a number of North American players who qualified for events alongside the 16 players who had left the BDO to form their own organisation.\nHe competed at the PDC World Championship each year between 1994 and 2004, but was unable to repeat the form he showed at that first event in 1994 – only reaching the last 16 in 1999 and 2000. His best performance at the World Matchplay came in 2000 when he made it to the quarter-finals but lost heavily to Ronnie Baxter.\nBrown has also had success on the North American darts circuit reaching several World-Ranked finals including the 1998 Calgary Golden Harvest (losing to Rod Harrington), the 1999 Cleveland Darts Extravaganza (losing to Alan Warriner), the 2001 Blueberry Hill Open (losing to John Part), and the 2006 U.S.A. Darts Classic (losing to David Marienthal). He won the 2004 Windy City Open and was runner-up the following year, and most recently won the 2009 Houston Open. In fact, Brown is one of a very small handful of players to have won World-Ranked events in three different decades, and was also the first player to hold all three ADO National Championships simultaneously.\nHe is also the only American male to be inducted into both the US National Darts Hall of Fame, and the Golden Harvest International Darts Hall of Fame.\nBrown lost out controversially on a place at the 2008 Lakeside World Championship. He made it to the semi-finals of the qualifiers in Bridlington – only to lose to Michael Rosenauer who then beat Swedish player Kenneth Hogwall to qualify for Lakeside. Rosenauer had also achieved qualification status for the PDC World Championship and elected to choose that championship instead – thus upsetting those players who he had knocked out of the qualifiers for the BDO version.\nAfter a somewhat disappointing 2008, Brown returned to form the following year. In addition to finishing the year as ADO #1, he claimed a spot on the US World Cup team for the 2009 WDF World Cup which was held in Charlotte, North Carolina, US. This was Brown's third time on a US World Cup Team, following South Africa (1999) and Malaysia (2001). Brown also came close to qualifying for the 2010 BDO World Darts Championship by way of the BDO Invitational Table, and had he done so, would have been the first American ever to qualify for Lakeside via the rankings.\nHe competed at the 2010 World Masters, where he lost to Scotland's John Henderson in the third round, and again reached the semi-finals of the BDO World Championship playoffs, losing to eventual qualifier Jan Dekker. Brown finished 2010 ranked as US #1 (for the fourth time) by the ADO. In 2012, Brown was forced to miss a number of major US tournaments, but still finished 11th in the ADO National Rankings. This means that, since Brown's first full year on the ADO circuit (1993), he has never been outside the Top 12 – a run of 20 consecutive years. Also in 2012, he won the Men's Singles at the Blueberry Hill Open for a record sixth time.\nPersonal life.\nSteve Brown lives in Loveland, Ohio, with his wife Missy. His favorite sports are speedway and football (soccer) – he supports AFC Wimbledon – and he also enjoys fishing, particularly catfishing. Other hobbies include cooking, classical music, and visiting cemeteries and graves of the famous. In addition to playing darts professionally, Brown is also involved in darts administration, currently serving as Communications Officer for the American Darts Organization. He had previously served five terms as Area 6 Manager.\nSteve's father, Ken was also a noted darts player during the 1970s, and was the first player ever to play in an official international match. In March 1974, Ken represented a Great Britain (BDO) team which played against the USA in New York. He was first on, beating Nicky Virachkul 2-1. Ken Brown's best tournament result came in reaching the last 16 of the Winmau World Masters in 1976. He also represented England six times (winning five) including a Man-of-the Match performance against Wales in 1978 (his last England appearance), and partnered Sandra Gibb to victory in the Mixed Doubles event in Yorkshire TV's Indoor League."

        "text": "The Icelandic Society for American Football (ISAF) was an icelandic American football league that played from 1988 to 1991.\nHistory.\nThe ISAF formed when the first three teams appeared on the Icelandic sports scene in 1988. In Icelandic, ISAF was known as \"Íslensk Samtök um Amerískan Fótbolta\". As in most other European countries, the teams appeared after a new TV station started to show NFL football games. Due to the teams´ emergence within the junior college system in Iceland, ISAF was first planned to be under the umbrella of the intercollegiate system. When it became necessary to accommodate interested players outside of the school-system, the teams got provisional status with local athletic associations. ISAF was then slated to be under the umbrella of Iceland's athletic association, but did not survive long enough to be officially registered as such. However, the local athletics associations served their role notably well by accommodating these experimental teams within their organizations.\nISAF was an informal association jointly run by the leaders of the three teams that formed the league. ISAF organized the first year and half of scrimmages between the teams. This included the recruitment of local Americans and other knowledgeable individuals for participation, training, and team support.\nISAF comprised the following teams (in chronological order of team founding):\nISAF organized one Icelandic championship tournament in the summer of 1990 at Valbjarnarvöllur in Reykjavik where each team played the two other teams. While the matches were well balanced, the results were in line with each team's experience so far. Garðabær's Stjarnan won both its games, Grafarvogur's Fjölnir came in second, and Kópavogur's Breiðablik came in third. The tournament was officiated by American soldiers stationed at the former US Naval base in Keflavík. \nSometime in 1990, the TV station Stöð 2 stopped showing NFL games. This caused interest to dwindle and ISAF teams found it difficult to attract players, support personnel, and obtain financial sponsorship. During 1991, ISAF stopped organizing 11-on-11 full-contact games. In effect, the departure of NFL broadcasting in Iceland was ISAF's undoing in 1991. This was in stark contrast with the rest of Europe that had continued TV exposure to NFL and experienced steady growth in the sport.\nFrom 2003 onwards, NFL games have again been viewable in Iceland and interest in playing the sport is emerging again."

Its main purposes were to co-ordinate domestic cricket and to organize tours of New Zealand teams abroad and of foreign teams to New Zealand.\nDomestic cricket.\nThere was no formal championship competition in New Zealand until the Plunket Shield was inaugurated in 1906. Until then, regular first-class matches were played by Canterbury, Otago, Auckland, Wellington, Hawke's Bay, Nelson (until 1891) and Taranaki (until 1898).\nThe 1906–07 season featured the inaugural Plunket Shield, which is still New Zealand's domestic first-class competition. The Plunket Shield was presented by the then governor-general, Lord Plunket, and was played on a challenge basis until 1920–21, since when it has been a league.

They again played New Zealand in Christchurch; this time New Zealand won.\nAustralia 1896–97.\nAustralia toured New Zealand in November 1896, playing five matches.

His idea was that the team would be a touring team to England or elsewhere.\nReese added that De Maus had obtained the last batting spot just ahead of Len Cuff, Alfred Holdship and Kinder Tucker. He did not consider for selection those who had established reputations in Australia before they moved to New Zealand, such as Syd Callaway, Alfred Clarke, Harry Graham and Charles Richardson."

Each team played each other once, and then The four best teams then played each other once more with no results carrying over, and the other four teams played each other again to determine ranking and relegation. This was the 51st World Championships, and also the 62nd ice hockey European Championships. The reigning world champions from Czechoslovakia finished fifth, and the Soviet Union became World Champions for the 20th time, and also won their 24th European Championship. In the European Championship, only mutual games between European teams in the first round were counted. For the disappointing Czechoslovaks, this was the first time since 1967 that they had finished out of the medals, and their worst result outside the Olympics since 1937.\nAttracting little notice at the time, Brett Hull made his debut in international hockey for the United States.

Drake improved upon their first winning season since the 1986–1987 season, making their first NCAA tournament appearance since their run to the Elite Eight in 1971 and their first postseason appearance since their National Invitational tournament appearance in 1986.\nPreseason.\nThe preseason Missouri Valley Conference Coaches' Poll picked the Bulldogs to finish ninth. No Drake players were voted to the preseason first or second teams. It is also noteworthy that Drake only returned one starter from the 2006–07 team that won 17 games, namely shooting guard Josh Young.\nDrake's starters were so lightly regarded on paper that \"ESPN.com\" reporter Adam Rittenberg remarked just before the 2008 NCAA tournament that they \"not long ago looked better suited for the scout team than the starting lineup\":\nRegular season.\nOn November 9 and 10, Drake competed in the Saint Mary's Tip-Off Classic. They defeated UC San Diego and lost to Saint Mary's College in the championship game. On December 1, 2007, Drake won the Iowa Realty Invitational with victories over North Carolina Central and Duquesne.

Their 11–1 record tied the best start in school history set by the 1969–70 team. It was the first 2–0 start by the Bulldogs in the MVC since the 1995–96 season. With the Bulldogs' 71–68 win over Evansville on January 6, 2008, they set a new Drake record for the best start in school history with a 12–1 mark.

On January 21, 2008, Drake received 92 points in the USA Today/ESPN Top 25 coaches poll which had them ranked 23rd. They also were ranked 22nd in the AP Top 25 poll with 313 points.

        "text": "The Drake Bulldogs men's basketball team represents Drake University, located in Des Moines, Iowa, in NCAA Division I basketball competition. The program is best known for making the 1969 Final Four. The Bulldogs have appeared seven times in the NCAA tournament, making their most recent appearance in 2024.\nHistory.\nThe early years (1906–1959).\nThe first season Drake fielded a men's basketball team was 1906–07. The Bulldogs finished with a 2–1 record as an independent. The next year, during the 1907–08 season, they were charter members of the Missouri Valley Conference.\nDrake went on to dominate the 1930s, winning three conference titles in the decade (1934–35, 1935–36, and 1938–39). The Bulldogs did not qualify for a postseason tournament by winning the conference title, though, as no post-season tournaments were held during the 1934–35 season. The following 1935–36 season Drake was invited to the District Olympic Tournament post-season tournament (defeating North Dakota 49–46, falling to Minnesota 36–19). The Bulldogs participated in the National Intercollegiate Tournament in 1937–38 (losing to Murray State 47–40) and 1938–39 (losing to Oklahoma State 28–15).\nThroughout the 1940s and 1950s Drake's winning streak secured eight winning seasons. There was no Missouri Valley Conference play during the 1943–44 and 1944–45 seasons because of World War II. This was in part because most MVC schools did not play basketball during those seasons. In 1951 Drake withdrew from the MVC, along with Bradley, in protest of the MVC's failure to discipline Oklahoma A&amp;M in the Johnny Bright Incident. Drake would not compete in the Missouri Valley Conference again until the 1956–57 season.\n1960–1986.\nDuring the 1960s through mid-1980s, the Bulldogs were in the national rankings on a regular basis and the MVC was one of the premier conferences in men's basketball. Drake had fourteen winning seasons during this time.\nMaury John era.\nCoach Maury John had a Drake record 211 wins (211-131) coaching the Bulldogs from 1958 to 1971. John came to Drake after he had compiled a 285–58 record (.831) at Moberly Junior College (1946–1958) and led Moberly to back-to-back NJCAA National Championships in 1954 and 1955. (John was replaced by Cotton Fitzsimmons at Moberly when he came to Drake.) After Coach John, Howard Stacey compiled a 34–44 record coaching Drake from 1971 to 1974, Bob Ortegel compiled a 94–103 record from 1974 to 1981 and Gary Garner was 95-104 from 1981 to 1988.\nUnder Coach John, Drake shared the 1963–64 Missouri Valley Conference title with Louisville and received an invitation to the 1964 National Invitation Tournament (NIT). In the NIT, Drake defeated Pittsburgh 87–82 in the first round and lost to tournament runner-up New Mexico 65–60 in the second round.\nThe 1968–69 Drake Bulldog season was by far the most accomplished in program history, as the Bulldogs advanced to the 1969 NCAA Final Four. The Bulldogs, under Coach John, won the Missouri Valley Conference outright and advanced to the 1969 NCAA Tournament Final Four, finishing third. During the tournament, Drake received a bye in the first round, defeated Texas A&amp;M 81–63 in the Sweet Sixteen and Colorado State in the Elite Eight 84–77. The Bulldogs would fall to eventual champion UCLA with Coach John Wooden 85–82 in the national semifinal before routing North Carolina under Coach Dean Smith 104–84 in the third-place game.\nIn the 1969 NCAA Final Four, on March 20, 1969 in the National Semi-Final, Drake lost to UCLA with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Coach John Wooden 85–82. Drake, with 24 points from Willie McCarter, 13 points with 16 rebounds from Willie Wise, and defense from Rick Wanamaker and Dolph Pulliam, almost pulled off a historic upset. UCLA led 83–74 with one minute and 12 seconds remaining before Drake scored eight straight points to make the score 83–82 with just seconds remaining. (UCLA would go on to defeat Purdue (92–72) in the NCAA Championship game, their fourth of seven consecutive NCAA Championships.\nThe Los Angeles Times described the closing moments of the UCLA game: \"Late in the game, UCLA led by three, but Drake had the ball and the momentum. Guard Willie McCarter put up a jumper from the left corner that ricocheted around the rim before falling into the hands of Drake forward Dolph Pulliam, who went straight back up with it. On the way up, Pulliam was hammered by Alcindor and Curtis Rowe, but the ball somehow made it through the hoop. The basket counted, but no foul was called against the Bruins. Eight seconds remained, and Drake trailed by one. UCLA escaped the Bulldogs' full-court press and got a pass through to Lynn Shackelford. In desperation, Drake's Ron Gwin fouled him. Shackelford made both of his one-and-one attempts.\"\nAfter the game, Coach John Wooden was asked what had been wrong with UCLA. Wooden replied simply,\"Drake.\"\nIn the 1969 NCAA 3rd-place game, the Bulldogs defeated Coach Dean Smith's ACC Champion North Carolina Tar Heels, with Charlie Scott convincingly, 104–84, behind 28 points from Willie McCarter. Drake finished the season 26–5.\nDrake continued their success under Coach John in the next two seasons as they advanced to the Elite Eight of both the 1970 NCAA tournament and the 1971 NCAA tournament. Drake finished 22–7 in 1969–1970 and 21–8 in 1970–1971.\nIn the 1969–70 season once again captured the Missouri Valley Conference title and made their second straight NCAA tournament. Earning a bye in the first round, Drake defeated Houston, with Coach Guy Lewis and Dwight Davis, 92–87. Drake lost to New Mexico State 87–78 in the 1971 Midwest Regional Final.\nIn 1970–71, the Bulldogs earned their third straight Missouri Valley Conference championship. They made their third straight NCAA trip, qualifying for the 1971 NCAA tournament. There, Drake (21–8) defeated Notre Dame University with Austin Carr 79–72 in OT, then lost to Kansas 73–71 in the Midwest Regional Final.\nIn 1971, after 13 seasons and a Drake record 211 wins, Coach John left Drake for Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. John's tenure at ISU was short, as he died of cancer on October 15, 1974 at the age of 55.\nBob Ortegel era.\nDrake won their first national tournament title during the 1974–75 season, capturing the National Commissioners Invitational Tournament postseason title under Coach Ortegel. In the tournament, the Bulldogs defeated USC 80–70, Bowling Green 78–65, and Arizona in the championship game 83–76.\nThe Bulldogs also advanced to the National Invitational Tournament during the 1980–81 season, under Coach Ortegel, losing to Minnesota in the first round 90–77 and the 1985–86 season under Coach Gary Garner, falling to Marquette 79–59 in the first round.\n1987–2006.\nFrom 1987 to 2006, Drake did not have a winning season in men's basketball; the stretch included a 2–26 season in 1996–97 and a 3–24 season in 1997–98. The Bulldogs went through four coaches, none of whom finished with a winning coaching record at Drake.\nIn the 2001–02 season Drake suspended four players at winter semester break due to their not abiding by the school's 2.0 GPA rule (NCAA requires 1.8), but despite having a depleted roster, the Bulldogs nearly eked out a winning season. Drake entered the MVC tournament with a 14–14 record; but fell to Illinois State 63–64 on a buzzer beating shot, ending the season 14–15.\nThe next season (2002–03) Drake would finish 10–20, leading to the dismissal of head coach Kurt Kanaskie at season's end.\nTom Davis era.\nOn April 22, 2003, Drake announced the hiring of former Iowa head coach Dr. Tom Davis as its new men's basketball coach. The hiring drew national attention and brought instant credibility to the struggling program. Davis’ career included sixteen 20-win seasons, 18 post season appearances, and he was named Associated Press National Coach of the Year in 1987.\nDuring the 2003–04 season, Davis began a massive rebuilding project of Bulldog basketball. After going 37–51 in his first three seasons, the team finished 17–15 in the 2006–2007 season for its first winning record in 21 years. Following the season, Davis resigned and was succeeded by his son Keno Davis.\n2007–2008 season.\nUnder the guidance of Keno Davis, the 2007–08 season was one of the most storied in Drake history. The Bulldogs won the Missouri Valley Conference regular season and tournament titles, advancing the NCAA tournament. Drake earned a five seed in the NCAA tournament and they were ranked nationally throughout the year. While playing Western Kentucky, though, Ty Rodgers hit a last-second 26-foot three-point shot, giving Western Kentucky a 101–99 overtime victory in the first round. Drake finished the season with a school best 28–5 record.\n2008–2017.\nAfter the successful 2007–08 season, Keno Davis accepted the head basketball coach position at Providence. As a result, Drake AD Sandy Hatfield Clubb hired former Arizona State assistant coach Mark Phelps. In 2008–09, Phelps' first season, the Bulldogs finished with a 17–16 record, falling in the College Insider Tournament to Idaho. Despite his ability to recruit, Phelps' on the court coaching led to finishes of 7th and below in the MVC and dwindling fan attendance and support. Phelps's contract was not renewed following the 2012–13 season, and Drake AD Sandy Hatfield Clubb replaced him with her new choice Ray Giacoletti. After failing to finish above .500 for three seasons and a 1–8 start in his fourth year, Giacoletti turned in his resignation to Drake AD Sandy Hatfield Clubb on December 6, 2016, and Interim Head Coach Jeff Rutter took over in his place, leading the team to their ninth play-in game in nine seasons under a coach chosen by Drake AD Sandy Hatfield Clubb.\nOn March 26, 2017, Drake University President \"Marty\" Martin named former Furman University head coach Niko Medved as head men's basketball coach. After a 17–17 season that exceeded low expectations, Medved announced his departure from Drake, accepting an offer from Colorado State University on March 22, 2018, less than one year after his tenure at Drake began.\n2018–present.\nOn March 29, 2018, Creighton University assistant coach Darian DeVries was named the new head coach of the team. Devries led the Bulldogs to a regular season record of 23–8 and won the MVC Championship in his first year as head coach. Devries was named MVC Coach of the Year for his role in returning Drake to the top of The Valley.\nIn 2020, Drake hosted Northern Iowa in a nationally televised game which was also the first Knapp Center sell out since the 2007-08 season. Drake lost in humiliating fashion to their instate conference rival scoring a season low 43 points in route to a 70-43 loss. Six days later at Arch Madness Drake scored a revenge upset against Northern Iowa, becoming the first team in tournament history to upset a 1-seed in the quarterfinal round 77-56. Drake would lose in the semifinal round to eventual tournament champion Bradley. Although the NCAA tournament was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic before brackets could be announced, the loss sent their instate rivals to the tournament bubble and many bracketologists expected the loss to cost Northern Iowa their chance at an at-large NCAA Tournament bid. Drake's upset also became the first time in school history a coach had led their team to back-to-back 20 win seasons in their first two seasons at the school.\nFor the 2020-21 season, Drake had an undefeated non-conference season and started the season with an 18-0 record, the best start in school history. The Bulldogs finished regular season with 24 wins to mark their third-straight 20-win season, a feat which had only previously happened once. The Bulldogs also equaled a school record with 15 Missouri Valley Conference wins.\nThe 2020-21 team made the program's first NCAA Tournament appearance in 13 years. Their First Four appearance against former MVC foe Wichita State on March 18 resulted in a 53-52 victory, which was the team's first win in the tournament in 50 years. The Bulldogs bowed out in the next round against the USC Trojans two days later, ending their season at 26-5.\nThe Drake Bulldogs gymnasium was featured in the final scene of the 2023 Peacock streaming movie Champions starring Woody Harrelson, Matt Cook &amp; Caitlin Olson.\nThe 2023-24 season was Drake's sixth straight season, all under Devries, with 20 or more wins and saw Drake go undefeated at home throughout the entire season. DeVries left just three days after the conclusion of the season to become the head coach at West Virginia.\nDrake Bulldog head coaches.\nList of Drake Bulldogs men's basketball head coaches\nRecord versus conference teams.\nBelow are the records of the Bulldogs versus current members of the Missouri Valley Conference.\nMVC All-Centennial Team.\nIn 2006–07, the Missouri Valley Conference celebrated its centennial as the nation's second-oldest NCAA Division I conference.

        "title": "Keith Johnson (cricket administrator)",
        "text": "Keith Ormond Edley Johnson (28 December 1894 – 19 October 1972), was an Australian cricket administrator. He was the manager of the Australian Services cricket team in England, India and Australia immediately after World War II, and of the Australian team that toured England in 1948. The 1948 Australian cricket team earned the sobriquet \"The Invincibles\" by being the first side to complete a tour of England without losing a single match.\nJohnson joined the Australian Board of Control for International Cricket in 1935 as a delegate for New South Wales and served in the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II, performing public relations work in London. With the allied victory in Europe, first-class cricket resumed and Johnson was appointed to manage the Australian Services team, which played England in a series of celebratory matches known as the Victory Tests to usher in the post-war era. The series was highly successful, with unprecedented crowds raising large amounts for war charities. As a result, further matches were scheduled and Johnson's men toured British India and Australia before being demobilised. Johnson's administration was regarded as a major factor in the success of the tour.\nIn 1948, Johnson managed the Australian tour of England, which again brought record profits and attendances, in spite of Australia's overwhelming dominance. Johnson's management of the tour—which generated large amounts of media attention—was again lauded. However, in 1951–52, the Australian Board of Control excluded Sid Barnes from the team for \"reasons other than cricket\". Barnes took the matter to court, and in the ensuing trial, his lawyer embarrassed Johnson, who contradicted himself several times under cross-examination. Following the trial, Johnson resigned from the board and took no further part in cricket administration.\nEarly years and pre-World War II career.\nJohnson was born on 28 December 1894 in the inner-Sydney suburb of Paddington. He later moved to the north shore suburb of Mosman, where he worked as a mechanic before serving briefly in the 3rd Field Company Army Engineers. On 8 October 1916, in the middle of World War I, Johnson enlisted in the First Australian Imperial Force as a gunner in the 5th Field Artillery Brigade. His unit left Sydney on 10 February 1917 and headed for Europe. He returned to Australia on 1 July 1919.\nAfter the end of World War I, Johnson married his wife Margaret. Johnson joined the Australian Board of Control for International Cricket in 1935 as a delegate for the New South Wales Cricket Association, having been affiliated with the Mosman Cricket Club in Sydney Grade Cricket. He had attended the annual general meeting in September 1934 as a proxy for Billy Bull, who was travelling back to Australia with the national team, which had been touring England.\nManagerial career.\nAustralian Services.\nDuring World War II, Johnson served in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). He enlisted in the RAAF on 13 April 1942 in Sydney. Johnson rose to the rank of flight lieutenant and was deployed to London, where he did public relations work at the RAAF's overseas headquarters. In June 1945, he was appointed as manager of the Australian Services cricket team on its tour of Britain for the Victory Tests, India and Australia from mid-1945 to early-1946. Officially a military unit, the team's commanding officer was Squadron leader Stan Sismey of the RAAF, although the on-field captain was Warrant officer Lindsay Hassett of the Second Australian Imperial Force.\nWisden Cricketers' Almanack praised Johnson's organisational work in arranging the services' tour: \"A stranger to this country, he found the programme in only skeleton form; and that the tour proved such a success from every point of view was due to his hard work and courtesy.\" The almanack reprinted Johnson's message of thanks to the English cricket community in full before the team sailed to India.\nThe Victory Tests started in May 1945 between the Australian Services and England in celebration of the allied victory in Europe. In previous seasons, the English cricket administrator and former captain Pelham Warner had organised matches between the RAAF and various English military teams as an expression of defiance against Nazi air raids, and the Victory Tests were a continuation of this, although the matches were only three days long and did not have Test status.\nIn the First Victory Test, the Australian Servicemen scraped home by six wickets with only two balls and minutes to spare. The last pre-war series between England and Australia in 1938 had been an attritional and hard-nosed contest, but in the afterglow of the war victory, the cricketers played flamboyantly with abandon in front of packed crowds. The attractive, attacking style of play was widely praised by commentators and the match raised £1,935 for war relief charities. England then levelled the series by winning the Second Victory Test at Bramall Lane, Sheffield with a hard-fought battle, by 41 runs. Australia won the Third Victory Test by four wickets late on the final day and drew the Fourth Victory Test at Lord's. That would have been the end of the series, but because of the record attendance of 93,000 at Lord's, another match was appended. England drew the series by winning the Fifth Victory Test in front of another capacity crowd. The Victory Tests were regarded as an outstanding success, with a total attendance of 367,000 and bright and attacking play.\nDue to the unexpectedly strong success of the Victory Tests, the government of Australia, acting on the impetus of Foreign Minister H.V. \"Doc\" Evatt, ordered the Australian Services to delay their demobilisation. With the team raising so much money for war charities, the government directed them to travel home via India and Ceylon to play further matches, in order to raise more funds for the Red Cross.\nJohnson found himself in a difficult situation during the Indian leg of the tour. The team—mostly made up of RAAF personnel—had been ill with food poisoning and dysentery, and travelled across the Indian subcontinent by long train journeys. The airmen wanted to travel by air, and threatened to abandon the tour or replace Hassett, an AIF member, with either Keith Carmody or Keith Miller, who were RAAF fighter pilots. However, the standoff was ended when Sismey arranged for a RAAF plane to transport the team. On the playing arena, it was not a happy tour for Johnson and his men. They lost the three-match series against India 1–0 and recorded only one victory, against South Zone, in their nine matches.\nJohnson's team arrived in Australia towards the end of 1945, but the armed services and Australian Board of Control ordered them to play another series against the various Australian states. Johnson had sought fixtures for his team in Australia, but this was before the Evatt had added the matches in the subcontinent. He implored the administrators to recognise that the players were already overworked, but was ignored. The Services performed poorly; after playing out consecutive draws against Western Australia and South Australia, they were crushed by an innings by both Victoria and New South Wales, before drawing against Queensland and Tasmania, the smallest state in the country.\nJohnson was involved in another administrative dispute during the Australian leg of the campaign. Cec Pepper—whom teammates Miller and Dick Whitington regarded as one of the best all rounders in the world and a certainty for Australian Test selection—appealed for leg before wicket against Australian captain Don Bradman in the match against South Australia. The appeal was turned down and Pepper complained to the umpire Jack Scott, prompting Bradman—who was also a member of the Australian Board of Control and the board of the South Australian Cricket Association—to ask Scott whether Pepper's behaviour was acceptable. As he was an employee of the SACA, Scott answered to Bradman, and he lodged a complaint about Pepper to the Australian Board of Control. Pepper was never selected for Australia. Cricket historian Gideon Haigh said that \"Johnson was clearly upset by the affair, and also by the failure of the [national] selection panel [Bradman among them] ... to send Pepper, second only to Miller as a cricketer in the Services XI, to New Zealand\". Johnson tried to intercede on Pepper's behalf, to no avail, although the other board members claimed that no pressure had been placed on the selectors to exclude Pepper.\nThe home leg of the tour was a poor end to the long and taxing Australian Services campaign. As the military men played poorly in Australia, the national selectors concluded that their achievements against England must have been against weak opposition, and only Hassett and Miller were selected for the Australian tour of New Zealand. Johnson then helped to arrange England's first post-war tour of Australia, in 1946–47.\n1948 tour.\nJohnson was a late appointment as manager for the 1948 tour of England, taking over from his New South Wales colleague Bill Jeanes, who was secretary of the Australian Board of Control and had managed the previous Australian tour of England in 1938. Jeanes had become increasingly unpopular among the players because of an approach that Haigh called \"increasingly officious and liverish\".\nLed by Bradman—widely regarded as the greatest batsman in history—the Australians went through their 34 matches without defeat, earning the sobriquet \"The Invincibles\". They won 25 of their matches, 17 of these by an innings, and crushed England 4–0 in the five Tests, winning most games heavily.\nDespite the Australians' domination of the local teams, the English public showed unprecedented levels of interest in the cricket. Record gate takings were registered at most venues, even when rain affected the matches, and the record attendance for a Test match in England was broken twice, in the Second Test at Lord's and the Fourth Test at Headingley. The 158,000 spectators that watched the proceedings at Headingley remain a record for a Test on English soil. As a result, Australia made £82,671 from the tour, resulting in a profit of £54,172. The popularity of the team meant that they were inundated with invitations for social appointments with government officials and members of the royal family, and they had to juggle a plethora of off-field engagements, with 103 days of scheduled cricket in the space of 144 days. As a result, Johnson was flooded with phone calls and letters, which he had to attend to by himself, as he was the only administrator among the touring party. Bradman later said he was worried that Johnson's tireless work would cause health problems because he \"worked like a slave day and night\" and that \"it was the tribute to a bulldog determination to see the job through\". The journalist Andy Flanagan said that Johnson was \"'on the ball' every minute of the waking day, and it would be safe to say half the night too.\"\nJohnson was again praised by Wisden in its report on the 1948 tour. \"Indebtedness for the smooth running of the tour and general harmony of the team was due largely to the manager, Mr Keith Johnson, hard-working and always genial,\" it said. \"Paying tribute to the loyalty of the players, Mr Johnson said there had not been a discordant note in the party throughout the tour.\" Flanagan labelled Johnson as \"conscientious, reserved, dignified, extraordinarily industrious and scrupulously trustworthy\". He went on to say that \"No organization, no body corporate, no individual could ever hope to have a more loyal, a more devoted, or a more conscientious officer...Although to the world in general all the praise and glory for the unequalled triumph the tour proved to be goes to Sir Donald Bradman, only those who travelled with the team will ever have a proper conception of the part played in that triumph by Keith Johnson.\" Bradman said that Johnson \"created friends and goodwill everywhere both for himself and the team, and no side could have wished for a better Manager\". On the journey back to Australia, the players presented Johnson with a silver Georgian salver, with their signatures engraved on the memento.\nIn a \"farewell message\" to England quoted in Wisden, Johnson said that the \"most lasting memory\" would be the team's visit to Balmoral Castle. Johnson said \"We felt we were going into an Englishman's home and into his family heart\". \"It was difficult to believe that we were being entertained by Royalty. My personal wish would be for everybody in the Empire to spend an hour or so with the King and Queen. It would do them a tremendous amount of good.\"\nBarnes libel case.\nJohnson's claim of tour harmony and player loyalty in 1948 was thrown into a different light by events less than four years later. The opening batsman Sid Barnes—a core member of the 1948 team—was seeking a return to Test cricket. Barnes was known for being a somewhat eccentric self-promoter. During the 1948 tour, Barnes organised a multitude of business deals while not playing cricket, and avoided paying customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he acquired in Britain by disembarking at Melbourne instead of Sydney.\nBarnes then made himself unavailable for first-class cricket, preferring to pursue business interests instead, and ridiculed the fee paid for the 1949–50 tour of South Africa. He wrote a column for Sydney's \"The Daily Telegraph\", titled \"Like It or Lump It\", in which he often lampooned the administration of the game.\nHowever, in 1951–52, Barnes made a return to cricket, and sought selection in the national team to play the West Indies during the 1951–52 Australian season. Australia had been unable to find a reliable opener to accompany Barnes's former partner Arthur Morris. Australia's batsmen struggled in the first two Tests, and before the Third Test, Barnes scored 107 against Victoria, putting on 210 in partnership with Morris for New South Wales. \"The Sporting Globe\" in Melbourne had presciently predicted that the board would object if the selectors chose Barnes.\nBarnes was duly selected for the Third Test by a panel of three, chaired by his former captain Bradman, but the choice was vetoed by the Australian Board of Control \"for reasons outside of cricket\". Bradman was one of four board members to support Barnes's selection, while 10 objected, including Johnson.\nThe matches took place and Barnes did not play. He was unable to find out why he had been excluded and was resigned to making an appearance before the board at its next meeting in September 1952 to ask for an explanation.\nIn the meantime, the team was not announced at the scheduled time due to the delay caused by the veto. Journalists deduced the story and Barnes became a \"cause célèbre\" for many weeks, missing all the remaining Tests. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a file of unknown authorship regarding Barnes's behaviour was deposited in the NSWCA library. It accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by cupping his hands over his eyes and showing dissent by implying that they were blind.\nBarnes continued to score heavily, and during one match, he crossed paths with Johnson, who reportedly apologised to him for the exclusion from the team. However, Johnson advised Barnes to \"keep quiet and say nothing\" and added that \"You will come out of it all right, you will be a certainty for the 1953 trip [to England]\".\nOn 24 April 1952, a letter appeared in Sydney's \"Daily Mirror\" from Jacob Raith, a baker from Stanmore in Sydney, in response to a letter from Barnes's friend Stacy Atkin, which condemned the board for vetoing Barnes's selection. Raith's letter said that the board must have had good reason to exclude Barnes.\nThe Board of Control had previously granted itself the power to exclude a player from the national team \"on grounds other than cricket ability\" following the poor behaviour of some members of the 1912 team that toured England. Instead, Barnes sued Raith for libel and engaged a top Sydney lawyer, Jack Shand—described by Haigh as \"the foremost trial lawyer of his day\"— to represent him, with the aim of uncovering the reasons for his exclusion. Bradman felt that Raith's letter was a premeditated set-up to give Barnes a pretext to instigate a trial. The libel trial, held in August 1952, was a sensation, and Johnson, still a member of the board, was the central figure. According to Haigh, \"it was effectively the Board, not Raith, in the dock\".\nIt emerged very quickly during the trial that Raith had no particular knowledge of the workings of the board. A series of administrators came forward to say that Barnes had reportedly misbehaved on the 1948 tour, even though Johnson's official report as manager had made no mention of any disharmony. Aubrey Oxlade, the chairman of the board and one of the four board members who voted to ratify Barnes's selection, said that the batsman's indiscretions were \"childish things\" and \"not serious at all\". Later, Frank Cush, another board member who had supported Barnes's inclusion, replied \"none at all\" when asked if there were any legitimate reasons for excluding Barnes. Selector Chappie Dwyer said \"I have a very high opinion of him as a cricketer ... and I have no objection to him as a man\".\nJohnson was called as a witness, and, under questioning from Shand, a different story came out. Johnson agreed that his written report of the 1948 tour had said that the team had behaved \"in a manner befitting worthy representatives of Australia\" and that \"on and off the field their conduct was exemplary\". However, in a verbal report, Johnson said he had drawn the board's attention to various misdemeanours by Barnes that, in his opinion, were sufficiently serious to warrant the player's exclusion from future Australian Test sides. Johnson said that Barnes had shown a \"general reluctance for anything savouring of authority\". The misdeeds included taking pictures as the Australian team was presented to the royal family on the playing arena during the Test match at Lord's, asking permission to travel alone in England (Barnes' family was living in Scotland at the time), and \"abducting\" twelfth man Ernie Toshack to play tennis during the match at Northampton on a court \"300 yards from the pavilion\". Under cross-examination, Johnson said that Barnes's taking pictures of the royal family at Lord's was the most serious of these misdemeanours. He admitted he had not known that Barnes had received permission from the MCC and the royal family's protocol chief to take the photos. Shand also established that Barnes had then shown the films to raise money for various charities. He further showed that Barnes had not agitated when reminded of the policy against players meeting with family members on tour. However, Johnson believed that the cumulative effect of the misdeeds \"warranted omission from the team\" and he saw no problem in the fact that his verbal advice to the board recommending Barnes' exclusion was at odds with the written report on the 1948 tour. Under pressure from Shand, Johnson admitted that \"I don't always write what I think\". According to Haigh, \"Shand effortlessly twisted him [Johnson] inside out\".\nShand had nearly reduced Johnson to tears, having previously caused a senior police officer to cry during the hearing of a royal commission the year before. A colleague of Shand's recalled his \"capacity of insinuation in tone which could annoy and bring a witness into antagonism\". Shand then asked Johnson about a hypothetical case of Barnes being selected in the future. Johnson evaded the matter of whether he would select the player until Shand asked him to assume that \"Barnes is in the best possible form and he is the best cricketer in Australia\", to which Johnson replied that he would not.\nOn the trial's second day, soon after Barnes had taken to the witness stand, Raith's counsel withdrew his client's defence. It had been his task, he said, to prove a plea that the allegation in Raith's letter was true, and that Barnes had not been excluded capriciously. Counsel remarked that \"seldom in the history of libel actions has such a plea failed so completely and utterly.\" The case ended at that point; Barnes was vindicated, and Raith's counsel issued him with a public apology. According to fellow administrator Alan Barnes, Johnson was a \"wide-open type of bloke\" who was vulnerable to manoeuvring. Colleagues advised Johnson to hire a lawyer before the case started, but he refused, saying that the libel case was merely a sporting matter, not a legal one.\nAftermath.\nAfter the libel trial, Johnson resigned from the board on 9 February 1953, and played no further part in cricket administration in Australia. He also resigned from the NSWCA and withdrew his candidature for the manager's position for the 1953 tour of England. Philip Derriman wrote in his history of the NSWCA that Johnson \"may be said to have been a victim of that affair no less than Barnes\". Johnson wrote to the Australian Board of Control, ostensibly tendering his resignation on the grounds of difficulties in travelling to meetings, and thanking the other members for their \"courtesy, cooperation and help\". He was not mentioned in the board minutes again until his death was noted almost two decades later.\nJohnson retained the support of many of the players: six Victorian members of the 1948 team, including Lindsay Hassett, Ian Johnson and Neil Harvey, wrote to the \"Herald\" newspaper in Melbourne expressing their \"confidence, respect and affection\" for the tour manager. Derriman described Johnson as a \"considerate, patient, inoffensive man for whom nothing was too much trouble. As a cricket official, he was efficient and dedicated.\" Johnson was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for services to cricket in the 1964 Queen's Birthday Honours, and died in 1972 after collapsing when rising to make a speech at a charity lunch in Sydney."

Jackson was listed by AND1 at 6'10\" and 375 pounds.\nTroy Jackson weighed close to as a senior at Hills East High School in Long Island, New York, but his performances at Rucker Park caught the attention of Bill Hughley, coach of Wallace Community College in Selma, Alabama. Jackson enrolled at Wallace, and even though he continued to play at 500 pounds (or more), he received all-region honors as a sophomore. \"People wonder how I played at 500-plus pounds. But to me it felt natural,\" he later said. Jackson's accomplishments in community college led to a scholarship offer from the University of Louisville, though the school demanded that he lose weight. Jackson complied, and by his senior year at Louisville, he had slimmed down to about after adhering to a strict diet.\nJackson only played twenty games for Louisville over two years, averaging 3.0 points per game and 1.6 rebounds per game in a reserve role. However, he became well known to basketball fans through the AND1 Mixtape Tour, a traveling streetball exhibition which he joined in 2002. With the AND1 Tour, Jackson used the nickname Escalade, a reference to the Cadillac SUV. His teammate Antwan \"8th Wonder\" Scott told the \"Herald Sun\", \"He's a big guy, but he can entertain and he can seriously play.\" Jackson appeared on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\" and was described as a \"streetball legend\" by the magazine \"Jet\".\nOff the basketball court, Jackson worked as an advocate for STD prevention. He died in his sleep of hypertensive heart disease on February 20, 2011."

        "title": "Irish Athletic Boxing Association",
        "text": "The Irish Athletic Boxing Association Ltd. (IABA) is the national governing body for amateur boxing on the island of Ireland, developing and controlling the sport. Founded in 1911, the IABA operates from the National Stadium in Dublin, the only purpose built amateur boxing stadium in the world.\nStructure.\nThe Irish Athletic Boxing Association organises, develops, fosters and controls amateur boxing across Ireland (including Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland); it is the national governing body (NGB) for amateur boxing. Boxing clubs in Ireland are represented and supported at county, provincial and national level. Boxing clubs affiliate to the IABA and are then entitled to compete at each of these three levels.\nThe IABA has established six 'provincial councils' for Ulster, Leinster, Connacht, Munster, Antrim, and Dublin. Although Antrim and Dublin are not among the four traditional provinces of Ireland, separate councils were set up due to large volumes of boxing clubs in these two areas. Each county in Ireland is also represented by its own 'county board'.\nHistory pre-1936.\nThe association was originally called the Irish Amateur Boxing Association. It led a nomadic existence, holding events, tournaments and boxing shows at many different venues. With the popularity of amateur boxing surging amongst the working class population, it was decided that a headquarters for the IABA and amateur boxing was required.\nNational Stadium.\nIn 1935, Dep.Commissioner WRE Murphy first proposed a boxing stadium. In 1937, the IABA proposed to construct a stadium solely for the purposes of boxing. The cost of building the National Stadium was over £12,000 (IEP), a considerable sum at the time. \nWRE Murphy and wife Mary Agnes Murphy raised 1/3 of the funds through private fundraising events. Mary Agnes gained prior experience in fundraising events in San Francisco when she worked with Monsignor John Rogers.\nIn 1939, the National Stadium, located in Dublin, was completed and officially opened. WRE Murphy was recognized by Ulick O'Connor as the father of Irish boxing and earned 3 lifetime seats at the stadium. The stadium was later renovated and modernized in 2000.\nThe National Stadium is the only purpose-built boxing stadium in the world. The Stadium is still managed by the IABA and has been in use for national and international boxing events ever since its official opening. The High Performance Unit is based at the National Sports Campus in Abbotstown, Dublin 12.\nThe IABA changed its company name from Irish Amateur Boxing Association to Irish Athletic Boxing Association (IABA) in January 2016, following a directive issued by AIBA, the international governing body, to all National Boxing Federations to remove the word 'Amateur' from the name of each individual Federation.\nOlympic success.\nMichael Carruth, Katie Taylor, and Kellie Harrington are the only Irish boxers to win a gold medal in the sport. Michael Carruth won gold at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, and exactly 20 years to the week later, Katie Taylor won gold at the London 2012 Olympics. She was the first Irish woman to qualify and compete in an Olympic boxing event. Taylor won her Olympic debut over Great Britain's Natasha Jonas with a 26–15 score. An International Olympic Committee official said that the decibels hit 113.7 – the highest crowd levels recorded at London 2012 so far. Paddy Barnes made history in 2012 by being the first Irish boxer to ever win two Olympic Medals at two consecutive Olympics – only two Irish athletes have managed this. The team that represented Irish boxing at the London 2012 Olympics has been the most successful IABA boxing Olympic Team since the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. The London 2012 team consisted of:\n2016 Rio Olympics.\nIn October 2015 the head coach of the IABA's High Performance Unit, Billy Walsh, left for the US to train the USA women's team. Although discussions on a new contract for Walsh had been on-going for several months, Walsh claimed the IABA \"changed their stance on virtually every detail\" of a new contract offer. The Irish Sports Council (Sport Ireland) publicly blamed the IABA for the loss of Walsh. The IABA, in return, refuted what it called the \"disgraceful allegations\" of Sports Ireland and claimed that Walsh left for financial reasons, and that Sports Ireland was using this loss to take control of the IABA's High Performance Unit.\nIreland's performance in the 2016 Rio Olympics boxing events was unsuccessful, with Ireland not featuring in any medal positions, despite having a number of seeded boxers. The USA women's team had its best performance ever.\nDevelopments after 2016 Rio Olympics.\nIn 2017 Sport Ireland published a review, the ‘Rio Review’, which said the boxing team's performance at the 2016 Games was not ‘a blip in an otherwise outstanding success story’ but the result of ‘underlying failings in the high performance programme.’ The 212-page review on Ireland's Olympic and Paralympic campaigns also said blaming the departure of head coach Billy Walsh, questionable judging decisions and a positive drugs test only masked ‘the real root causes.’ The Irish Athletic Boxing Association's (IABA) high performance funding for 2017 was cut by €200,000. Disagreements among senior members of the IABA has led to warnings from Sport Ireland that further steps will be taken against the IABA. \nSuccessful Irish boxer Bernard Dunne (13 Irish amateur championships and the WBA Super Bantamweight world title in 2009) was appointed director of the high-performance unit in April 2017. The IABA also announced that their High Performance Unit would move to the Sport Ireland National Sports Campus on a permanent basis following the completion of an agreement with the Sport Ireland Institute.\nIn the following month the feud both within the IABA and with Sport Ireland flared up again, with two people claiming to be the chairman of the IABA: Dublin barrister Joe Christle and Waterford's David O’Brien. O'Brien claimed that a meeting of the board of directors was held on 27 March, which Joe Christle did not attend. The IABA president Pat Ryan did attend. O'Brien claimed that he was voted in as the chairman of the board of directors, as Christle's time on the board had finished, and he (O'Brien) called for both Christle and the CEO of the IABA, Fergal Carruth, to step down. Christle, in turn, claimed that the vote taken at that meeting was invalid, as there were insufficient members present to form a quorum. Joe Christle was recognised by Sport Ireland, while five members of the board of directors approved David O’Brien as an alternative chairman, leading to deep divisions within the body.\nOn 7 June both the minister for sport, Patrick O'Donovan, and John Treacy, Sport Ireland chief executive, said they recognised Christle as chairman. They set a 30th of June deadline for the IABA to get its act together and introduce a new rule book, which would ensure the autonomy of the High Performance Unit and ensure Dunne's sole right to make team selections in keeping with recommendations made in the post-Olympic ‘Rio Review’. In response, the following day IABA president Ryan penned a strongly-worded letter to Christle, criticising many of Christle's recent decisions as well as outlining concerns in relation to the organisation's current leadership, among other issues.\nOne day later the IABA board of directors (a majority of whom supported Christle's position as chairman) published a statement replying to Pat Ryan's letter, which had been leaked. The statement was posted on the IABA website. The board members emphasised that they had received legal advice to support Christle's position as chairman. The board's statement also reiterated their intention to introduce a new IABA Rule Book as demanded by Sport Ireland."

He was signed by the Baltimore Ravens as an undrafted free agent in 1999. He played college football at Tuskegee University.\nProfessional career.\nMitchell is best remembered for his stellar play as a reserve safety on the 2000 Ravens squad that made an improbable run to Super Bowl XXXV. In a pivotal January 2001 playoff game played in Nashville, Baltimore was tied 10–10 with the Tennessee Titans early in the fourth quarter. With just over 12 minutes remaining in the game, Titans kicker Al Del Greco lined up for a potential game-winning 37-yard field goal from the right hash. At the snap, Baltimore defensive lineman Keith Washington bullrushed the Titans lineman defending him, losing his helmet in the process; undeterred, Washington stretched out his right arm over his head, deflecting Del Greco's kick high into the air. Mitchell snatched the tipped ball out of the air at the Ravens' 10-yard line, raced up the far sideline and, with the help of blocks thrown by backup safety Corey Harris and starting cornerback Chris McAlister, returned the ball 90 yards for a Baltimore touchdown. Mitchell's return catapulted the Ravens to a 24–10 win and set them on the path to their first world championship. Mitchell also played for the Jacksonville Jaguars and Cincinnati Bengals.\nPersonal life.\nMitchell's son, Keaton Mitchell, played running back at East Carolina University before he too was signed by the Ravens as an undrafted free agent before the 2023 season."

        "title": "Rugby-Bundesliga",
        "text": "The Rugby-Bundesliga is the highest level of the league system for rugby union in Germany, organised by the German Rugby Federation.\nThe league has a mix of professional, semi-professional and amateur players, with four club in the league being officially professional outfits.\nFrom 2012 to 2015 the Bundesliga was expanded from ten to 24 and the league divided into four regional divisions of six teams each. Below the Bundesliga the 2. Bundesliga was organised in a similar fashion. From 2015 onwards the league returned to sixteen clubs.\nHistory.\nThe German rugby championship was first played in 1909 and, with the exception of 2002, has always been determined by a final.\nThe Rugby-Bundesliga was first played in two divisions in the 1971-72 season and soon consisted of six teams in the North and ten teams in the South. However, of the eight southern teams, five were located in Heidelberg and after 1975 all northern teams were from Hanover. The founding members of the league were SV Odin Hannover, SV 1908 Ricklingen, DSV 1878 Hannover, TSV Victoria Linden, SC Siemensstadt and FC St. Pauli Rugby in the north and SC Neuenheim, RG Heidelberg, Heidelberger RK, Heidelberger TV, TSV Handschuhsheim, RC Hürth, Bonner SC, ASV Köln Rugby, SC 1880 Frankfurt and Eintracht Frankfurt Rugby.\nThe league has changed its format a number of times over the years. In 1997-98, it played as a single-division league with eight teams. From 1998 to 2001, it was divided into two regional divisions again. The top-three teams from each of the two divisions then qualified for the finals round, held in a home-and-away format. The top two teams out of this round then played the German Final in a home-and-away format. The bottom three teams in each division played a spring round together with the top three teams of the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga to determine the clubs who would play in the Bundesliga in the next season.\nSince 2001, the Bundesliga has been organised as a single division again with eight teams playing each other in a home-and-away season. The top two teams play each other in the championship final. In its first season, 2001–02, no final was held and the regular season winner was also the German champions. In the first 34 editions of the Final, there was always a team from Hanover present. Only in 2006 did this stop, and no team from Hanover has played in the final since.\nBelow the Bundesliga, two 2nd Bundesligas, north and south, form the second tier of the league system, with the winners promoted to the Bundesliga. The third tier of rugby is formed by the nine \"Regionalligen\", regional leagues.\nSC 1880 Frankfurt, the 2007-08 champions, had to wait 83 years for its fifth title, having last won the championship in 1925. \nOn 19 July 2008 at the annual general meeting of the German rugby association, the \"DRV\" decided to expand the Bundesliga and slightly change its modus. It was decided to expand the league to nine teams for 2008-09 and ten teams for 2009-10, meaning only one club will be relegated in 2009, and two promoted. Also, the play-off format was changed, with four teams qualifying for the finals. At the bottom end, in 2008-09, the last two teams would determine one relegated club via playoff. From 2009-10, the bottom four clubs will play-off to determine two relegated teams.\nThe women's Rugby-Bundesliga consists of six teams in 2008 and also plays a final between the top two clubs at the end of the season.\nAs a sign of the gap between the Bundesliga and the 2nd Bundesliga, TSV Victoria Linden, who only won the 2009-10 North/East division in the last round of the championship, declined promotion, citing the additional cost of travelling and the limited player pool as their reason. The South/West champion, Stuttgarter RC, has also indicated that it would not take up promotion, leaving the Bundesliga with only eight clubs for the next season. It also meant, for the first time ever, that no club from Hanover would compete at the top level of German rugby. \"DSV 78\" protested the decision to reduce the league to eight teams again and thereby relegating the club. The annual convention of the German Rugby Federation however decided in early July 2010 to allow \"DSV 78\" to stay in the Bundesliga.\nIn February 2011, the \"DRV\" decided that the league would continue to play with ten teams in the near future.\nIn mid-July 2012 the \"Deutsche Rugby Tag\", the annual general meeting of the \"DRV\" decided to approve a league reform proposed by German international Manuel Wilhelm. The new system saw the number of clubs in the Bundesliga increased from ten to 24, the league divided into four regional divisions of six clubs each and the finals series expanded from four to sixteen teams. One of the main aims of the reform was to reduce the number of kilometres travelled by individual teams and therefore reduce the travel expenses. The system will remain mostly unchanged for the 2013-14 season. The only changes will be a play-off between the fourth and fifth placed teams in each group after the first stage to determine the clubs advancing to the second stage. The championship play-offs after the second stage will be reduced from sixteen to twelve clubs with the top two teams in each group advancing directly to the quarter-finals while the remaining eight will play a wild card round to determine the other four quarter finalists.\nAt the annual general meeting of the DRV in July 2015 it was decided to return to a sixteen club format with two regional divisions of eight. The last placed in each division would be relegated while the seventh placed teams would have to play-off against the third and fourth best team of the 2. Bundesliga. The German championship in turn will be contested by the best two teams in each group.\nChampionship finals.\nThe German rugby champions are determined by a final (except in 2001-02), currently contested by the two top teams of the Bundesliga:\nWinners &amp; Finalists.\nAs of 2016, this is the standing in the all-time winners list of the Bundesliga:\nLeague placings.\nSince 1998, the following clubs have played in the league. From 1999 to 2001, the league consisted of two regional divisions of six teams each. After an autumn (A) round, the top three from each group would reach the championship finals round in spring (S). The bottom three, together with the top three from each of the two 2nd Bundesligas would play a promotion round in spring with the top three in each group playing in the Bundesliga the following autumn. In 1997-98 and from 2001 to 2012, the league has been played in a single-division format. From 2012–13 to 2014–15 it had been divided into a first (I) and second round (II), followed by play-offs:\nPlayer statistics.\nThe top try and point scorers in recent season were:\nattendance.\nRugby Bundesliga has not got a lot of attendance\nTotal attendance for tournament = 10,221\naverage attendance for match = 50"

The Detroit Wolverines defeated the St. Louis Browns in a 15-game World Series match played in ten cities.\nThe Louisville Colonels set a Major League record which still stands for the most base on balls for a team in a game, with 19 against the Cleveland Blues on 21 September.\nLeague leaders.\nIn 1887, bases on balls (walks) were counted as hits by the major leagues in existence at the time. This inflated batting averages, with 11 players batting .400 or better, and the experiment was abandoned the following season. Historical statistics for the season were later revised, such that \"Bases on balls shall always be treated as neither a time at bat nor a hit for the batter.\" This results in ambiguity for some players' season and career hits totals, notably with Cap Anson. Anson was credited with a .421 average and the National League batting title in 1887; however, the recalculation of averages with walks excluded lowered his average to .347 and retroactively gave the batting title to Sam Thompson.\nPostseason.\nWorld Series:"

The BBC extended their television coverage to show all 8 days of the event and the prize money was more than double that of the previous year.\nDefending champion Cliff Thorburn lost to John Spencer in the first round, but it was fellow Canadian Kirk Stevens' maximum break against Jimmy White in the 9th frame of their semi-final, for which the tournament is perhaps best remembered. The break earned Stevens £10,000 for the 147, £1,000 for the highest break, and a gold award for breaking the tournament record. It was Stevens' second maximum break, the other being made in a practice session, and only the 3rd ever televised 147 break by any player. \"I couldn't believe how I felt. I was just enthralled in it, lost in it\" Stevens said. Meanwhile, White won the match 6–4 with a 119 break in the next frame and went on to win his only Masters title. In front of his home crowd, he beat Welshman Terry Griffiths by 9 frames to 5, playing in his fourth Masters final in five years.\nField.\nDefending champion Cliff Thorburn was the number 1 seed with World Champion Steve Davis seeded 2.

        "text": "The British Universities American Football League (BUAFL), is an American football league contested by university teams in the United Kingdom as part of the British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS) organisation. The league was formed by the British American Football Association (BAFA), the national governing body of American football in the UK, in 2007 as the successor to the British Collegiate American Football League, after BAFA withdrew its recognition of the British Student American Football Association which ran that league. The BUAFL has been credited with reviving interest in American football in the UK.\nFrom 2008, the BUAFL was officially associated with the National Football League (NFL), through its partner organisation NFL UK. In 2012, BUAFL's league and teams were absorbed into BUCS after American football became an official BUCS sport. Over the period 2007 to 2014, the BUAFL grew from 42 teams and 2,460 participants to 75 teams and over 4,100 people involved.\nLeague structure.\nOver the course of the regular season, each team in the Premier and Tier 1 plays between eight regular season games. Each team plays everyone in their division twice; once home and once away. For the 2016/17 season, Tier 2 is broken down into six conferences, five of seven teams and one (South East) of eight; teams in Tier 2 play a six-game season (seven in the South East division), playing each other only once.\nCurrent structure.\nThe latest structure for the BUAFL system was announced by BUCS on 26 August 2016. It consists of two Premier divisions, six regional Tier 1 divisions and six regional Tier 2 divisions. This differs from the standard BUCS structure of five geographical regions below Premier level. The Premier and Tier 1 divisions are considered to be of \"high performance\" by the BAFA and BUCS. The teams allocated to each division at the start of the 2023–2024 season were:\nEarlier structures.\nThe first two full seasons of BUCS American Football preserved the single tier, eight conference structure inherited from BUAFL. In 2014–15, this was changed to a two tier system with the formation of two Premier divisions (North and South), each of five teams. The eight regional conferences, slightly reorganised (in particular, the small Scottish conference became the more balanced Borders conference, including teams from northern England) to contain 8 or 9 teams each, became the second tier. At the same time the Championship was reduced to the top two teams from each Premier division and the Challenge trophy was replaced with cup competitions for North and South Tier 1 divisional winners, with the winners being promoted to the appropriate Premier division.\nFor the 2015–16 season, the league was split in three tiers. The premier remained organised into North and South, although the top four (of five) in each division now entered the Championship playoff, with the fifth being relegated. The second tier contained 6 geographic division, three Northern (Scottish North, Northern and Midlands) and three Southern (Western, South and Southeastern). The Trophy playoffs took the top two from each division plus the top two remaining teams with the best record from the northern and southern regions, the playoffs were structured with a \"northern semi-final\" and a \"southern semi-final\", with the semi-final winners promoted to the respective Premier division regardless of the result in the final. The third tier was organised into 8 divisions, four Northern (Scottish North, Northern, Midlands and North Midlands) and four Southern (Western, South, Southeastern and London).

Hutchinson (born December 17, 1969) is an American former college football player who was a defensive tackle and outside linebacker for the Michigan Wolverines football team of the University of Michigan from 1989 to 1992. He was selected as a first-team All-American in 1992. He was also named the Big Ten Conference Defensive Lineman of the Year in 1992, was named to the Academic All-Big Ten team three times, was voted a team captain and MVP in 1992, and won an NCAA Post-Graduate Scholarship.\nEarly years.\nChris was born in 1969 in Joliet, Illinois. He moved to Houston, Texas at age five. He attended Cypress Creek High School in Harris County, Texas.\nUniversity of Michigan.\nHutchinson enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1988 and played football for the Wolverines from 1989 to 1992.\nAfter redshirting in 1988, he started all 12 games at defensive tackle for the 1989 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled a 10-2 record in Bo Schembechler's final year as Michigan's head coach. Hutchinson was selected by the \"Sporting News\" as the nation's outstanding freshman defensive lineman.\nAs a sophomore, Hutchinson started seven games at defensive tackle for the 1990 Michigan team that compiled a 9-3 record in Gary Moeller's first year as head coach.\nAs a junior, Hutchinson started eight games at defensive tackle for the 1991 Michigan team that compiled a 10-2 record, and finished the season ranked #6 in the AP Poll. At the end of the season, Hutchinson was selected as a first-team All-Big Ten defensive tackle.\nAs a senior, Hutchinson was voted a team tri-captain and started six games at defensive tackle and six games at outside linebacker for the undefeated 1992 Michigan team that compiled a 9-0-3 record and defeated Washington in the 1993 Rose Bowl. During the 1992 season, Hutchinson broke Michigan's single season record for quarterback sack yardage with 99 and tied the single season sack record with eleven. He concluded his collegiate career with 24 career sacks, then the second highest total in Michigan history. He also finished second in Michigan history for career sack yardage.\nAt the end of the 1992 season, Hutchinson was selected as the team's Most Valuable Player, won the Dick Katcher and Meyer Morton Awards, and was named the Big Ten Conference Defensive Lineman of the Year. He was also selected by the American Football Coaches Association, Football Writers Association of America, Scripps-Howard and \"Football News\" as a first-team player on the 1990 College Football All-America Team. In addition to his athletic performance, Hutchinson also performed at a high level academically, being named to the Academic All-Big Ten team three times and becoming an NCAA Post-Graduate Scholarship winner.\nLater years.\nAfter graduating from Michigan, Hutchinson signed as a free agent with the Cleveland Browns. During rookie training camp, Hutchinson developed complications from a tetanus shot, which precipitated his retirement from football. He enrolled at the University of Michigan Medical School and became a physician. As of September 2018, he was living in Plymouth, Michigan, and working as an emergency room physician at Beaumont Hospital. His youngest child, Aidan, is a defensive end who also attended Michigan and was selected second overall by the Detroit Lions in the 2022 NFL Draft."

        "text": "The Northern Ireland national cricket team is a representative cricket team for Northern Ireland. It does not play in International Cricket Council (ICC) competitions, as Northern Ireland is part of Cricket Ireland and is represented by the Ireland cricket team. However, a standalone Northern Ireland team has been formed on a few occasions.\nHistory.\nCricket in Ireland is usually organised on an all-Ireland basis, with the national side representing both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. However, for the cricket tournament at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, a Northern Ireland team took part, as the Republic is not a member of the Commonwealth. It remains the only appearance of such a side in international cricket.\nThe tournament started for Northern Ireland with a match against South Africa. Northern Ireland scored 89/5 before rain brought an end to their innings in the 39th over. A target of 131 from 38 overs was set using the Duckworth-Lewis method for South Africa, which they achieved in the 32nd over, Dale Benkenstein scoring 44 not out. Ryan Eagleson took 3/28 for the Northern Irish team.\nTheir second match was against Barbados, and Barbados scored 296/5 from their 50 overs, Philo Wallace top scoring with 92. Northern Ireland could only score 120/7 in reply, Stephen Smyth top scoring with 58, losing by 176 runs.\nNorthern Ireland picked up their only win in their third match, against Bangladesh. Northern Ireland batted first and were bowled out for 177, with Kyle McCallan scoring an unbeaten 53. They then bowled out their opponents for 63 with Gordon Cooke taking five wickets.\nPlayers.\nThe following players played for Northern Ireland in their only tournament:"

        "text": "The 2007 South Africa rugby union tour of Europe were a series of rugby union matches played in November and December 2007 in Europe featuring the 2007 Rugby World Cup winners South Africa. Although the matches had been arranged well in advance of the World Cup, the mini-tour was seen as an opportunity for South Africa to showcase their talents and to say farewell to their outgoing coach, Jake White, who retired after the second game. In the event, several members of the World Cup squad were unavailable for either game, because of retirement (Os du Randt), injury (Percy Montgomery, Fourie du Preez, Bakkies Botha), club commitments (Butch James), or other reasons (Victor Matfield), and the captain, John Smit, who had just joined French club ASM Clermont Auvergne, was released to play only in the first match.\nWeek 1.\nThe first match, and the only one with full Test status, was against Wales, on 24 November 2007, at the Millennium Stadium. Although Wales had more possession and dominated territorially, they managed to score just two tries, both from kicks. The first was scored by Welsh full-back Morgan Stoddart, who was making his Test debut. The second, the result of a bad mistake by Springbok full-back Ruan Pienaar, was scored by Colin Charvis; it was his 22nd Test try, a new record for a forward in Test rugby. South Africa made better use of their more limited possession, scoring five tries, including one by Ryan Kankowski, also a Test debutant, as the world cup winners won the match 34–12.\nWeek 2.\nThe second match, at Twickenham on 1 December 2007, saw a Springbok XV facing a Barbarians side that included such big names as Jerry Collins, Martyn Williams, Matt Giteau, and the retiring Jason Robinson. The Barbarians' plans were disrupted when the English Premier clubs decided not to allow players to be released, and the Irish provinces followed suit. As a result, Brian O'Driscoll, who had been named to captain the side, had to withdraw, as did Andrew Sheridan of Sale Sharks, but Mark Regan of Bristol defied the ban and led the Barbarians, an act for which he was later sanctioned by his club. The match itself proved to be somewhat one-sided affair, the lacklustre Springboks, who included just five World Cup final starters, losing 22–5 to a Barbarians side that played with flair and creativity. The Barabarians scored three tries, the South Africans only one, scored by Barend Pieterse, who was making his first appearance in a Springbok jersey in place of Schalk Burger, who had broken his nose in the game against Wales."

        "title": "Gordon Bell (American football)",
        "text": "Gordon Granville Bell (born December 25, 1953) is an American former professional football player who was a running back, kickoff returner and punt returner who played for the Michigan Wolverines from 1973 to 1975, and professionally for the New York Giants (1976-1977) and St. Louis Cardinals (1978) of the National Football League (NFL).\nBell was a two-time All-Ohio running back in high school and led Ohio's Troy High School to undefeated seasons in 1970 and 1971. As a 16-year-old junior, he rushed for 324 yards in a single game; for the year he had 1,593 yards rushing and scored 146 points. As a senior in 1971, he lost the Ohio AAA high school back of the year award to Archie Griffin.\nBell played tailback for Michigan teams that had a combined record of 28-3-3 from 1973 to 1975. As a junior in 1974, Bell was a part-time player who started only three of Michigan's eleven games, but he still managed to become only the third player in school history to rush for 1,000 yards in a season. In 1975, he set several single-season school records, including most all-purpose yards (1,714 yards), most 100-yard rushing games (eight), and most rushing attempts (273). At the time of his graduation from Michigan, Bell also ranked second in school history in career rushing yards and third in all-purpose yards. Though Bell's records have been surpassed in more recent years, he remains one of the all-time rushing leaders in Michigan history. Despite his accomplishments, Bell played in the shadow of Big Ten Conference rival, Archie Griffin, who won back-to-back Heisman Trophies. In some respects, Bell exceeded even Griffin's accomplishments, as Bell won the 1975 Big Ten rushing championship.\nBell played three years of professional football, but never made it into the starting lineup for an NFL team. In three NFL seasons, he had 1,444 all-purpose yards. His best NFL season was 1976, when he had 784 all-purpose yards.\nYouth.\nA native of Troy, Ohio, Bell had attended Ohio State Buckeyes games with his father from the age of six. In high school, he was one of the top football prospects in Ohio. As a junior at Troy High School in 1970, Bell gained over 1,593 yards, scored 146 points, led Troy High to its first unbeaten season (10-0) since 1957, and was named to the Associated Press 1970 All-Ohio Class AAA high school first team. In the 1970 season opener, 16-year-old Bell rushed for 324 yards and scored four touchdowns in a 54–6 win over Piqua High School. Afterward, Bell said, \"All I can say is that my line was tremendous.\" Piqua's coach said, \"Our kids were on Bell from the start, but they just couldn't bring him down.\" In October 1970, Bell put on \"one of the greatest one-man shows ever seen at Beavercreek,\" scoring three touchdowns and rushing for 233 yards in 30 carries. The Beavercreek coach said afterward that the game's turning point came the moment Bell walked onto the field.\nAs a senior in 1971, Bell led Troy High to a 10–0 record. In the season opener, Bell broke off tackle and rushed 70 yards for a touchdown the first time he got the ball. He scored touchdowns in three of his first four carries, though one was nullified by a penalty. Bell rushed for 190 yards and three touchdowns in the season opener. The opposing coach said, \"It was the same old story. We knew we had to stop Bell and yet we still couldn't do it. That boy is a great football player.\" Bell again won first-team All-Ohio honors, but he lost the Associated Press 1971 Ohio AAA high school back of the year award. The award instead went to a high school senior from Columbus, Archie Griffin. Bell and Griffin would continue their rivalry in college.\nIn 1971, Bell also won the Piqua YMCA high school weight-lifting contest in the 165-pound class.\nUniversity of Michigan.\nOverview.\nBell was recruited to the University of Michigan by assistant coach Gary Moeller. He was a relatively small player, standing tall, and weighing . He was sometimes referred to as Michigan's \"mighty mite tailback.\" In addition to his speed, what set him apart from other backs was his ability to cut and find the smallest of holes. Bo Schembechler called Bell \"the greatest cutback runner I've ever coached.\" In 1975, the Associated Press noted: \"Bell is noted for his ability to cut on a dime, spurt through miniscule [sic] holes and hurdle tacklers. He's got fine speed and he's durable. Bell seems to get -- pardon the expression -- his bell rung on many tackles, only to bounce up as if nothing happened.\" Noted Michigan radio broadcaster Bob Ufer often referred to Bell as \"little Gordie Bell.\" Ufer once humorously said, referring to Bell's ability to shift directions quickly, that Bell \"could run fifteen minutes in a phone booth and never touch the sides.\"\nIn his career at Michigan, Bell gained 2,902 rushing yards in 535 carries, and scored 28 rushing touchdowns. In addition to running from scrimmage, Bell ran back 12 kickoffs for an average of 26.4 yards.\n1973 season.\nAs a sophomore in 1973, Bell saw his first action against Iowa. He was given five carries and gained 50 yards (including a 24-yard gain) for a ten-yard per carry average. Bell did not start any games in 1973, but his playing time increased later in the season, including 19 carries against Minnesota for 73 yards and 15 carries against Indiana for 89 yards. For the season, Bell rushed for 464 yards in 88 carries. The 1973 team finished with a record of 10–0–1, with the only imperfection coming at the end of the season with a 10–10 tie with Ohio State. Despite tying for the Big Ten Conference championship, Big Ten athletic directors decided to send Ohio State to the Rose Bowl, and conference rules did not permit Michigan to play in another bowl game. Michigan ended up ranked number 6 in the final Associated Press poll.\n1974 season.\nFor the 1974 season, Bell rushed for 1048 yards which was, at that time, the third highest single-season total in school history. He joined Ron Johnson and Billy Taylor as the only players in Michigan history to rush for 1,000 yards in a season. Bell accomplished the feat despite being a part-time player, sharing the starting tailback job with sophomore Rob Lytle. In the 1974 campaign, Lytle started eight games to Bell's three, although Bell outrushed Lytle 1048 yards to 802. Bell had lost about in the summer before the 1974 season, dropping to . He said, \"I did it on my own to help me run, to make me quicker.\"\nAsked in 1974 about his alternating Lytle and Bell at the tailback position, Bo Schembechler said: \"They're both good. They have equal ability and they both deserve to play.\", Bell said at the time that he did not mind sharing playing time with Lytle because \"we're both pretty fair backs. It's only fair that we share it.\" In an October 1974 win over Minnesota (by a score of 49–0), Bell and Lytle combined for 292 rushing yards—158 for Lytle and 134 for Bell.\nIn Michigan's 51–0 victory over Purdue in November 1974, Bell rushed for 166 yards in 22 carries for a 7.2 yards per carry average. He also set up a field goal and another touchdown with runs of 32 and 39 yards. Bell was named the UPI's Midwest offensive player of the week for the effort. When a reporter asked Bell for a comment, he said, \"Coach doesn't want us to say anything this week. We've got to get ready for Ohio State.\"\nAfter Bell and Lytle combined for 1,850 rushing yards in 1974, Schembechler said: \"Bell and Lytle are the greatest combination in the country. Bell is the best cut runner I've ever had. Lytle is a great power runner. The tailback position is healthy to say the least.\"\n1975 season.\nIn both 1975, Bell again shared the Michigan backfield duties with Rob Lytle. Bell was a senior in 1975 on a Michigan team that went 8–2–2 and finished the season ranked #8 in the final Associated Press poll. Bell rushed for 1,390 yards, added 314 yards on kickoff returns, and was voted the team's Most Valuable Player.\nMichigan started the 1975 season ranked #3 in the country, and moved into the #2 spot with a 23–6 win over Wisconsin in the season opener. Despite being hampered by a muscle pull, Bell still rushed for 210 yards in 28 carries against Wisconsin. After the game, Bell noted that he \"couldn't cut as well as (he) would have liked,\" but he played through the injury realizing that, as a senior, \"the coaches expect us to show the way.\" On being named the UPI's Midwest Back of the Week, Bell noted, \"It's really an honor to be recognized like that, but you have to have a lot of help out there. I thought Rick Leach was just super in the game. He sure didn't look like a freshman. And our offensive line did the job despite having so many sophomores in there.\" Bell's 210-yard performance against Wisconsin stood as the school record in a season opener for 28 years until Chris Perry rushed for 232 yards in the 2003 season opener against Central Michigan.\nAfter the opener against Wisconsin, Bell and the Wolverines tied games against Stanford (19–19) and Baylor (14–14). Despite being favored by 18 points over Baylor, the Wolverines nearly lost and fell out of the top 10 in national ranking for the first time since September 1972. After the Baylor game, Schembechler said the team lacked leadership. Bell may have been the one player to whom Bo's criticism did not apply, as he had a career-long 64-yard kickoff return against Baylor, scored both of Michigan's touchdowns, and rushed for 89 yards in 26 carries. Bell's second touchdown against Baylor came with 6:50 remaining in the fourth quarter and saved the Wolverines from a defeat.\nThe Wolverines rebounded into the top 10 with a 31–7 victory over Missouri in the fourth game of the season and strung together seven straight wins before facing Ohio State. Bell rushed for 119 yards against Missouri and had 150 all-purpose yards. In a 16–6 win over Michigan State in week five, Bell scored Michigan's only touchdown on a 19-yard run in the fourth quarter. The Wolverines beat Northwestern Wildcats, 69–0, in week six. For the first time in Michigan history, the Wolverines had three backs who each rushed for at least 100 yards. As the starting back, Bell rushed for 100 yards and scored two touchdowns in the first quarter alone. With the game turning into a blowout, Schembechler pulled Bell after the first quarter, and Rob Lytle gained another 105 yards, before being replaced by Harlan Huckleby who gained 157 yards. Michigan tied the modern Big Ten record of 573 rushing yards in the game.\nIn a 28–21 win against Minnesota, Bell rushed for 174 yards on 31 carries for his fifth consecutive 100-yard game. He also scored two touchdowns, including a 23-yard run midway through the fourth quarter. The UPI noted: \"Bell's clinching run came with 8:04 gone in the final quarter and saved Michigan from the embarrassment of a tie.\" Bell's performance in the Minnesota game gave him 2,488 career rushing yards, second in school history to Billy Taylor's record of 3,072 yards. In a close 21–15 win over Illinois, Bell scored two first-quarter touchdowns and carried the ball a career-high 35 times. Going into the Ohio State game, Bell was in a three-person contest for the Big Ten Conference rushing championship. Bell led with an average of 134.1 yards per conference game to 125.1 for Billy Marek of Wisconsin, and 123.7 for Archie Griffin.\nMichigan ended the season with a 21–14 loss to Ohio State. Despite the loss, Bell won the battle of the backs, rushing for 124 yards on 21 carries and throwing for a touchdown pass, while Griffin was limited to 46 yards on 19 carries. Bell had 166 all-purpose yards against the Buckeyes, his last regular season game for Michigan. In his only bowl game appearance, Bell played in a 14–6 loss to the Oklahoma Sooners in Orange Bowl after the 1975 season. He gained 53 yards rushing and 90 all-purpose yards.\nComparisons to Archie Griffin.\nBell was Michigan's starting running back in the same years in which Archie Griffin won consecutive Heisman Trophies for Ohio State. In head-to-head meetings in 1974 and 1975, Bell played as well or better than Griffin. In 1974, each carried the ball 25 times, and Bell ended up with 108 yards compared with 111 yards for Griffin although Ohio State won the game 12–10. In 1975, Bell outgained Griffin 124 yards to 46 yards. Bell averaged 132.9 yards per game in 1975 to lead Griffin and the Big Ten Conference in conference game rushing. Even so, Griffin won the Heisman Trophy, and Bell finished eighth in the 1975 Heisman Trophy voting.\nDuring the 1975 season, Bell was asked how he felt about all the publicity being received by Griffin. He replied: \"All of the publicity in the world doesn't help you win. I don't feel slighted because Archie is in our conference. I feel I'm just as good as he is.\" Bell later recalled: \"Those two games against Ohio State were my biggest, and I consider the second game a personal victory. I outrushed Archie, but he had a great public relations guy in Woody Hayes. . . . He wasn't the best player in the conference so how can he be the best player in the country?\"\nLee Larkins, who played for Purdue and was one of the top defensive backs in the Big Ten, said in 1976 that Bell was the best running back he ever played against. As a senior, Larkins played against Gordon Bell, Archie Griffin, and Ricky Bell of USC. Larkins said: \"Gordon Bell was the best of the three. He was a super tough runner and a tough guy to make a solid tackle on. Gordon has a lot more speed and more moves than Archie does, and I thought he was a better all around player.\"\nRelationship with Bo Schembechler.\nDuring Bell's years at Michigan, he played for the Wolverines' legendary coach, Bo Schembechler. Near the end of Bell's freshman year, Bell told Schembechler he was taking an incomplete in a course. Schembechler talked to Bell's father, Trenton Bell, about the incomplete. Schembechler recalled, \"Trenton told me (Gordon)'d be back to finish that course. And he was.\" Schembechler added, \"Gordie listens to Trenton. What he says gets done.\"\nSchembechler described Gordon Bell as \"a very, very durable guy.\" Bo noted: \"He isn't exactly frail. He's put together well. He's a confident guy. Exciting and good as he is, he's also one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet.\"\nAs Archie Griffin garnered the lion's share of the media attention in 1975, Schembechler spoke out for Bell: \"I think Bell's as good as any back there is anywhere. I haven't seen any who looks better. . . . He is certainly the most underpublicized great back in the country.\"\nRecords and honors.\nBell finished the 1975 season as the Big Ten's leading rusher, was selected to the Associated Press All-Big Ten team, was chosen as Michigan's Most Valuable Player, and finished eighth in the Heisman Trophy voting. In a year with an abundance of strong running backs, Bell and Earl Campbell were relegated to the AP's third-team All-American, as Archie Griffin and Ricky Bell took first-team honors, and Tony Dorsett and Jimmy DuBose took second-team honors.\nBell's career at Michigan was among the best in school history to that point. His school records included:\nProfessional career.\nNew York Giants.\nBell was selected by the New York Giants in the fourth round of the 1976 NFL draft. Bell did not get much playing time early in the 1976 season with the Giants. In late November, columnist David Bushnell wrote an article, \"Are Giants missing the boat on Gordon Bell?,\" questioning the team's lack of utilization of Bell. Bushnell noted that Bell had \"spent most of the season standing on the sideline waiting to be inserted into the lineup for a few plays.\" The Giants' starting running back in 1976 was Doug Kotar, though Bushnell opined that Bell was the superior back: \"Bell is quick, with speed to break any play for a long gain, and he can catch the ball. . . . If the Giants are trying to break Bell in gradually, they might just miss the boat totally, breaking Bell instead.\" Bell noted at the time that the lack of playing time held him back: \"It takes me about a quarter or so to get going, break a sweat and get the legs loosened up. I really don't like being shuffled in and out so much, but as a rookie I can't do much about it.\" Bell also added, \"Sure it's been hard for me to be a spot player, especially because my body isn't ideal for that type job. I think it's better for me to play a lot, but then again I'm not the coach.\"\nThe 1976 Giants, who started 0–7 under Bill Arnsparger before going 3–4 under John McVay, had a diversified offense in which Bell was second on the team with 25 receptions for 198 yards. When Kotar was injured, Bell got his first start of the 1976 season on November 27, 1976. Bell rushed for two touchdowns in a 28-16 victory over the Seattle Seahawks. He posted the best day of his professional career, with touchdown runs of two and 21 yards, gaining 56 yards on the ground and 41 more on pass receptions. After the game, Bell said, \"I needed a game like that.\" The backfield was led by Doug Kotar and Larry Csonka with Bell being the third leading rusher.\nHaving seen little playing time as a rookie in 1976, Bell played even less in 1977, as the Giants worked Bob Hammond and Willie Spencer into the rushing rotation. Bell rushed for 63 yards in 16 carries for the entire 1977 season. His main contribution to the 1977 Giants was as a kickoff returner, as he returned 12 kickoffs for 235 yards, second best on the Giants after Hammond.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nDuring 1978, he was briefly on the Green Bay Packers roster during training camp, and he signed with the St. Louis Cardinals in November. In 1978, Bell had more kickoff returns (eight) than rushes (seven) with St. Louis.\nLater years.\nAfter retiring from football, Bell ran a barbecue restaurant in Dayton, Ohio. He later sold radio advertising in Detroit, Michigan and Chicago, Illinois."

Glasgow won the race and was selected by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) at a meeting in Sri Lanka to host the games. The vote was 47 votes for Glasgow and 24 for Abuja. The decision was announced by Mike Fennell, the Chairman of the CGF.\nBidding process.\nBidding timeline.\nThe bidding process has a series deadlines and milestones in the Candidature Procedure\nThe main dates were:\nThe Candidate City Manual was published in November 2005. It comes in 4 parts, the first part outlines what is required of the Candidate City during the bid process, the second part provides the structure of the Candidature File to be submitted to the CGF, the third part gives precise instructions on the presentation of a Candidature City's presentation to the CGF. The last part outlines the issues during and after the bid process.\nVote.\nThe final decision on who was to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games was held in Colombo, Sri Lanka on 9 November 2007 at the CGF General Assembly.\nEach bid city made a presentation to the General Assembly, the order of which was determined by drawing lots.\nThe CGF members voted in a secret ballot and as there was only 2 bids with winner was announced by the CGF President, Mike Fennell in the first round, with the winner only requiring a simple majority.\nThe results of the bidding process were\nCities that were considered.\nCandidate Cities.\nThree cities submitted bids to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games that were recognised by the CGF. The three cities were; Glasgow (Scotland), Abuja (Nigeria) and Halifax (Canada).\nProposed bids which did not go to application.\nThe following cities proposed bidding; however, they did not bid or even formally announce their intentions to bid.\nEvaluation of Candidate Cities.\nThe Report of the CGF Evaluation Commission for the 2014 Commonwealth Games was published on 9 September 2007, John Tieney, the Chairman of the CGF Evaluation Commission said: \"The commission believes that the report is a fair and accurate representation of each city's bid, its strengths and the major issues which may arise if the city is selected\".

        "text": "The Glasgow bid for the 2014 Commonwealth Games was the successful bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games by the city of Glasgow, Scotland. It beat the Abuja 2014 Commonwealth Games bid to host the games. The event was held over 11 days, with the opening ceremony taking place on 23 July, 2014, and the last day of competition and the closing ceremony on 3 August, 2014.\nBackground.\nGlasgow had been known as \"The Second City of the Empire\", the population of the City of Glasgow unitary authority is 578,790. 1,171,390 people live in the Greater Glasgow Urban Area based on the 2001 census.\nGlasgow has never hosted such a large international sporting event as the Commonwealth Games, although Glasgow has hosted the 1978 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, 1990 European Indoor Athletics Championships and many European club football finals and many UK sporting events in the city.\nGlasgow was originally announced as the Scottish candidate over Edinburgh (which hosted the Games in 1970 and 1986, and the inaugural 2000 Commonwealth Youth Games) following a cost-benefit analysis by the Scottish Executive.\nVenues.\nThe Glasgow bid consisted of a mix of new and refurbished venues, linked by enhanced roads and public transport network, as well as an athlete's village, built specifically for the games and situated adjacent to key venues.\nHampden Park, Scotland's National Football Stadium, would be the main venue for athletics and for the closing ceremony, while Celtic Park would be used for the opening ceremony.\nThe Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, on the north bank of the River Clyde, would provide several multipurpose arena style venues as well as the planned Scottish National Arena for events such as gymnastics, boxing, wrestling, weightlifting, and judo as well as hosting associated entertainments events for the duration of the games.\nKelvingrove Park, in the city's West End, already has five bowling greens installed for competitive use. A comprehensive upgrade and refurbishment of the park is underway, and the park is also capable of holding events such as triathlon and hockey, although Glasgow Green could be a possible alternative venue for the latter events. Kelvingrove Park is situated close to the SECC and is adjacent to the Kelvin Hall, which could also potentially host several indoor events. Ibrox Stadium is the planned venue for the rugby sevens tournament. The shooting competition will likely take place at another outdoor venue in the city, such as Pollok Park or the military Dechmont ranges in Cambuslang. If rowing was included as an event, it would likely be held at Strathclyde Park, which hosted the 2006 Commonwealth Rowing Championships.\nA new Indoor Arena and Velodrome Complex is planned for Parkhead in the East End of the city, the velodrome itself will be opposite Celtic Park, which will be used for the opening ceremony. These venues would be built regardless of the outcome of Glasgow's bid, and would become the headquarters of sportscotland and Scottish Cycling, and could be expected to host events such as netball, squash, badminton and table tennis, as well as track cycling. Adjacent to this, a potential site for an athletes' village has also been identified in Dalmarnock. The village would be purpose-built to house 6,000 athletes and officials in 2,500 residential units and leave a legacy of regeneration in this deprived district of the city. Nearby Tollcross Park Aquatics Centre, which already has one Olympic standard 50 metre swimming pool, would be extensively upgraded, and a second 50-metre pool would be added for the Games' aquatic events.\nThe Glasgow 2014 Bid Committee issued a list of 17 sports that they planned to host:\nThe Scottish Government and Glasgow City Council have agreed to underwrite the costs of staging the Games. This will be on the basis of an 80/20 split, with an estimated 20% split costing the city £288m to stage the event. 80% of the costs will be covered by the Executive with new money committed to the sports and major events budget.\n£1 billion will be spent on enhancements to the city's transport infrastructure by 2014, including completion of major motorway links, like the M74 and East End Regeneration Route, the Glasgow Airport Rail Link, improved city centre rail links as a result of the Glasgow Crossrail scheme, light rapid transport to key facilities such as the SECC and possible refurbishment and extension of the Glasgow Subway as well as improvements to the River Clyde including new bridges and river-based transport.\nEvaluation process.\nThe deadline for formal submission of bids to the CGF, in the form of a Candidate City File, was set for May 2007. The Evaluation Commission visited Glasgow on 10 June to 13 June 2007. The conclusions of the CGF Evaluation Commission were that: \"Glasgow submitted a complete and well researched Candidature File. Overall proposals are grounded in a thoughtful and practical approach considering currently codified Commonwealth Games requirements. In particular, venue and legacy issues were appropriately addressed with obvious sensitivity to Glasgow's long term needs...Glasgow has shown it has the ability to stage the 2014 Commonwealth Games to a standard which would continue to enhance the image and prestige of the Games.\" This put Glasgow ahead in terms of the technical comprehensiveness of its bid.\nReaction.\nAlex Salmond the First Minister of Scotland said:\nMichael Fennell the CGF President, said:"

        "text": "The Abuja bid for the 2014 Commonwealth Games was an unsuccessful bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games by the city of Abuja, Nigeria. The bidding race was won by the Glasgow 2014 bid after a 47–24 vote by the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) General Assembly on 9 November 2007 in Sri Lanka.\nBackground.\nThe former Nigerian leader General Yakubu Gowon was the head of the Abuja 2014 Commonwealth Games bid team, he called for all Nigerians to support the games for the \"glory of Nigeria\". He suggested that Nigeria would be a prime location for the games because of its unity, serenity, topography and availability of standard sporting facilities. Abuja had recently hosted the All-Africa Games, The African regional version of the olympics, for which it constructed a world-class olympic stadium and games village. It was a hugely successful tournament with more than 7,000 athletes (and larger in size than any Commonwealth Games ever held). The 2014 Commonwealth Games would also be an integral part of national celebration plans for Nigeria's centenary.\nThe Abuja bid received strong support from African Commonwealth members (which make up the bulk of the Commonwealth) as well as Australia, in what would be the largest multi-sport event to be held thus far on the continent. Despite its number of members, no African country has ever hosted the games and is that last major continent, excluding South America never to have acted as host. The website, www.abuja2014.org simple said \"...completing the Commonwealth Games Circle\"\nAn article from Jonathan Clayton of the Times said:\nAbuja airport would be modernised to cater for the sheer capacity of the influx due to the games. This would further boost their bid to host the games. A state of the art light rail transit system was included in the bid documents. The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) administration announced that it had awarded a $841m contract for the construction of the system, which would be completed by 2012.\nSports.\nThe Abuja 2014 Bid Committee issued a list of 17 sports that they planned to host:\nThe Abuja 2014 Commonwealth Games Bid, led by General Yakubu Gowon, submitted the Abuja 2014 Candidature File (Bid Book) on Wednesday, 9 May 2007 to the President of the Commonwealth Games Federation, Michael Fennel, at a ceremony in London where Glasgow also submitted its Candidature File. Members of the Commonwealth Games Federation Executive Board and representatives of the Scotland and Nigeria Communities were also present at the ceremony.\nEvaluation process.\nThe Evaluation Commission visited Abuja between 4 and 7 June 2007. The conclusions of the CGF Evaluation Commission were that \"The Abuja Bid Committee submitted a Candidate City File which has the substantial and broad backing of the Nigerian Government. The Evaluation Commission submitted a number of issues to be clarified by Abuja and while most of these matters were addressed, a number of matters remain of concern and these are noted in the body of the report...and any decision to award the games to Abuja should be conditional on these matters being addressed\"\nGeneral Yakubu Gowon, said that his country was also \"confident\", despite the adverse evaluation of its bid by a four-member team in September. The group's report found fault with the city's plans for budgeting, transport, legacy, marketing and venues. \"As far as we are concerned our bid is not only an Abuja bid but an African bid,\" said General Gowon. \"We are going there for a good, good fight, remember I am a general.\"\nFinal selection process.\n\"A vote for Abuja means a vote for whole of Africa,\" appealed Nobel Peace Prize winner Bishop Desmond Tutu to delegates during the final video presentation to delegates before voting began.\nReaction.\nGeneral Gowon accepted that the Games had been won by \"a better presentation\" but \"The size of the vote for Glasgow was a surprise. We thought we had a very strong case for bringing the Games to Africa for the first time\", he went on \"It was a friendly battle and we hope we will win next time.\"\nMichael Fennell the CGF President, said:\nThe website simple said \"We appreciate, all your efforts, contributions and for believing in us.

        "text": "Albert Jenkins (11 March 1895 – 7 October 1953) was an international rugby player for Wales and played club rugby for Llanelli RFC between 1919 and 1928. Jenkins was one of the greatest backs to have played for Llanelli and is compared to later Scarlet heroes Lewis Jones and Phil Bennett. Jenkins was a strong tackler and was an extremely fast runner from a standing start. He was also an excellent kicker with either foot and could punt the ball half the length of the pitch. He was sometimes criticised for his decision making on the field, and wasn't at his best away from Stradey Park.\nIn the book \"Stradey Stories\", author comments, \"such was his drawing power that if by some quirk of fate, Albert could not take to the field because of injury or work commitment (he was a steelworker), the fans would leave the stadium in droves and not bother to watch the ensuing match.\"\nJenkins is seen as one of Llanelli's greatest players but he was at his peak when Welsh rugby was at one of its worst points in its history.\nClub career.\nJenkins played for Llanelli juniors but on the outbreak of the First World War Jenkins joined the British Army and served in France in the 38th Welsh Regiment. \nThe 38th Welsh Regiment fought at the Somme, Ypres and Epehy, three most gruelling, gruesome and vicious battles. He served his country with distinction in one of the most horrific and bloody conflicts in history.\nOn his return in 1919, Jenkins rejoined Llanelli and gained a position in the senior team. He would later play for Llanelli against the New Zealand All Blacks, losing in 1924, but beating them 3–0 in 1926.\nInternational career.\nJenkins played fourteen matches for Wales, his first cap was against England on 14 January 1920 just four months after his Llanelli debut. His greatest international was the game against Ireland in 1920 when Jenkins set up three tries for club mate Bryn Williams, scored a try himself, kicked two of the resulting conversions and was successful with a drop goal attempt. In the 1921 game against Scotland, Jenkins played with incredible commitment, but on occasions it appeared he was playing the Scots on his own due to the poor performance of the rest of the Welsh team.\nJenkins would go on to captain Wales twice, his first against Ireland in 1923, losing both games.\nIn 1950 a tribute match was held in his honour at Stradey Park.\nJenkins died on 7 October 1953 and was buried at Box cemetery, Llanelli. \nNorman Lewis of Llanelli wrote \"Jenkins seemed to youthful eyes a mystical figure imbued with powers the rest could only dream about\"\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "title": "Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball",
        "text": "The Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball team represents the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts (about 40 miles (64 km) west of Boston) in NCAA Division I competition. The team competes in the Patriot League and plays their home games in the Hart Center. The program boasts such notable alumni as Boston Celtics legends Bob Cousy and Tom Heinsohn, and longtime Providence College basketball coach Joe Mullaney. \nUnder coach Doggie Julian, the Crusaders won a national championship in 1947. It is the only school from Massachusetts to win an NCAA Division I tournament. Dave Paulsen was appointed the program's 19th head coach on March 28, 2023.\nHistory.\nBeginnings and national prominence.\nBasketball first appeared at Holy Cross in 1900 but was discontinued several times until its reinstatement in 1939. The Crusaders originally played their home games at the Boston Garden and the South High Community School. In 1947, the Crusaders, behind coach Doggie Julian, NCAA tournament MVP George Kaftan, star Joe Mullaney and freshman point guard Bob Cousy, beat Oklahoma at Madison Square Garden to win the NCAA championship.\nThe team entered the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as the last seed in the 8-team tournament. In the first game, Holy Cross defeated the Navy 55–47, in front of a sold-out crowd at Madison Square Garden. Mullaney led the team in scoring with 18 points, mostly in part to Navy coach Ben Carnevale's decision to have his players back off from Mullaney, who was reputed as being more of a playmaker than a shooter. In the semi-final match, Holy Cross faced the City College of New York, coached by Nat Holman. The Crusaders, led by Kaftan's 30-point game, defeated the Beavers 60–45. In the championship game, Holy Cross faced a Bruce Drake coached University of Oklahoma team in another sold-out game at Madison Square Garden. Kaftan followed up his semi-final game performance with 18 points in the title game, leading the Crusaders to a 58–47 victory against the Sooners. Along with UConn, Holy Cross is one of the two New England schools to ever win the NCAA tournament.\nHoly Cross finished the 1947 championship season with 23 straight wins and became the first college from the New England area (as well as from the state of Massachusetts) to win a national college basketball title. 35,000 people watched a parade in the team's honor on Holy Cross Day in Worcester, Massachusetts. Future NBA legend Cousy was named AP and UP player of the year. In 1989, the NCAA voted teammate George Kaftan to the all-decade team of the 1940s.\nThe Crusaders followed up their championship by advancing to the 1948 NCAA Tournament's Final Four. After advancing to the Elite Eight in 1953, the Crusaders would wait 63 years before claiming another win in the NCAA Tournament.\nIn 1954, Holy Cross won the NIT Tournament behind another future NBA Hall-of-famer and Celtics legend Tom Heinsohn. This is widely recognized as the College's second national title in basketball due to the prestige of the NIT at the time.\nIn 1977, Holy Cross defeated a talented Providence team twice on last-second shots by forward Chris Potter and led top-ranked Michigan at the half in the first round of the NCAA tournament before being defeated. The following year, Sports Illustrated ranked Holy Cross and freshman of the year Ronnie Perry ninth in its pre-season poll.\nFollowing the team's championship years of the 40s and 50s, the Crusaders have been ranked only occasionally by the Associated Press. After appearing in 65 of 116 total weekly polls (56%) in the 1950s, the Crusaders appeared in only 5 of 126 weekly polls (4%) in the 1960s and 9 of 148 (6%) in the 1970s. The Crusaders have not been nationally ranked since January 1978.\nPatriot League.\nHoly Cross could have joined the newly founded Big East Conference in 1980, but college President Rev. John E. Brooks, S.J., vetoed the move for academic reasons. Holy Cross stayed independent until joining the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) to start the 1983–84 season. It moved to the Patriot League in 1991.\nIn recent decades, the men's basketball team has been the leading varsity program of the Holy Cross' athletic department. The men's basketball team has won six Patriot League titles (1993, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2007, 2016) since the league's formation in 1991.\nWith Ralph Willard as head coach, the Holy Cross men's team nearly accomplished three major upsets in the NCAA tournament. In 2001 as a fifteen seed, the Crusaders lost 72–68 to a second-seeded Kentucky team who advanced to the Sweet Sixteen. In 2002, the sixteenth-seeded Crusaders nearly became the first #16 seed to defeat a #1 seed, losing 70–59 to a top-seeded Kansas squad who advanced to the Final Four. The Crusaders led 37–35 at halftime, 44–39 with 11 minutes remaining and trailed by three points with fewer than two minutes remaining. In 2003 as a fourteenth seed, the Crusaders lost 72–68 to third-seeded, Dwyane Wade-led Marquette that would advance to the Final Four.\nIn 2016, the Crusaders made a miraculous run in the postseason. The team entered the Patriot League Tournament as the ninth seed and ultimately defeated second-seeded Lehigh in the championship game to earn an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2007. The Crusaders then defeated Southern University marking the first NCAA win for the program since 1953.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Crusaders have appeared in the NCAA tournament 13 times. Their combined record is 8–13. They were national champions in 1947.\nNIT results.\nThe Crusaders have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 12 times. Their combined record is 11–11. They were NIT Champions in 1954.\nCIT results.\nThe Crusaders have appeared in the CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament (CIT) one time. Their record is 1–1.\nAppearances in final national polls.\nHoly Cross has made 79 appearances in the AP Poll since it was introduced during the 1948-1949 season, peaking at No. 1 for five weeks in 1950. The College last appeared in the AP Poll during the 1977–1978 season. Holy Cross has finished the year ranked by the Helms Athletic Foundation in 1947 and in the final Associated Press poll of the season on six occasions:\nHonored jerseys.\nNote: As the College program stated, the jerseys were retired but not the \"numbers\" so other players can wear them:"

        "title": "1982 State of Origin series",
        "text": "The 1982 State of Origin series was the first annual three-match series between New South Wales and Queensland to be played entirely under \"state of origin\" selection rules. After the matches in 1980 and 1981 that trialed the concept, 'Origin' was fully embraced in 1982, with no matches using the previous seventy-four years' residential-based selection rules ever played again.\nThe series came down to the deciding third match, which a mistake-riddled New South Wales lost to a more professional Queensland.\nGame I.\nIn preparation for the first ever full State of Origin series, the Blues were afforded a two-and-a-half-week preparation under New South Wales' coach Frank Stanton, including time spent training for the annual City vs Country Origin match. Maroons coach Artie Beetson however had only four days to build a team out of his men as Sydney clubs refused to release their players from club duties the weekend before game one. This would lead the QRL to demand more of their players' time to prepare for State of Origin fixtures.\nNew South Wales, captained for the first time by Manly-Warringah hooker Max Krilich who got the job ahead of Parramatta lock Ray Price, won their first Origin match in game I of the 1982 series at Lang Park 20–16, inspired by a fine display from halfback Steve Mortimer but not before resisting another valiant comeback by Queensland. The Blues led 17-6 and appeared to be coasting toward a comfortable victory until centre Mal Meninga – who achieved the rare feat of winning the man-of-the-match award from a losing side – cut a swathe through the New South Wales defence. His destructive bursts led to tries for winger John Ribot and centre Mitch Brennan which cut the Blues’ lead to one point. Mortimer laid on a late try for Penrith's powerful young replacement back Brad Izzard to lift the Blues to a 20–16 lead and the Maroons were then required to battle desperately to hold their line intact for the final minutes. Fullback Greg Brentnall kept the scores tight when he leapt spectacularly to claim a Queensland bomb a minute from full-time.\nGame II.\nFor game II, also played at Lang Park, the Maroons made several changes as they tried to keep the series alive. Meninga was sidelined with a shoulder injury, opening the way for the debut of Gene Miles who would go on to star in 20 Origins for Queensland throughout the 1980s and would form a regular Australian Test side pairing with his Origin opposite Brett Kenny, who would debut in the next game.\nMaroons coach Arthur Beetson sprang a late surprise when he replaced Manly-Warringah second-rower Paul Vautin, who made his Australian debut a month later in the test series against New Zealand, in the starting line-up with veteran front-rower Rod Morris. Morris had played only a handful of club games for Wynnum-Manly after emerging from retirement, but Beetson's move proved a masterstroke.\nThe Queensland plan was to bustle the Blues out of the contest and they were aided in this by Qld referee Barry Gomersall making his own Origin debut and allowing the Maroons enormous latitude in the tackles.\nWith Morris leading from the front in a man-of-the-match winning performance, Queensland ground New South Wales out of the contest, scoring three tries to one to win 11–7. Miles scored the first try when he ran over the top of Blues fullback Greg Brentnall. The Maroons led 8-7 before Vautin sealed the result with a late try scored after second-rower Rohan Hancock punched a hole in the Blues defence close to the line.\nQueensland's win in game 2 ensured that the third game would also be played under Origin rules. According to some reports, had NSW wrapped up the series in the second game, the third game in Sydney would have reverted to the old State of Residence rules and would most likely have been played at Leichhardt Oval instead of on the hallowed turf of the Sydney Cricket Ground.\nGame III.\nThe first three-match series came down to a Game III decider to be played at the Sydney Cricket Ground, the first time the Maroons had played at the ground since 1976. The attendance of 20,242 was the largest for an interstate game in Sydney since 1973 when 19,049 saw NSW defeat Qld 26-0 (reports at the time said NSWRL officials would have been happy if they got 20,000 to Origin's first game in Sydney after years of sub 5,000 crowds for interstate games at Leichhardt Oval). Officiated by a neutral referee – New Zealander Don Wilson, it was the first State of Origin match to be played in Sydney, and for the players, test positions in the Australian team for the upcoming series against New Zealand hung in the balance.\nThe Blues made wholesale changes and among the new faces were Brett Kenny at five-eighth in place of Manly's Alan Thompson, Canterbury centre Phil Sigsworth at fullback, and virtual unknown Moree Boomerangs winger Phillip Duke who had starred for NSW Country in the annual City vs Country Origin match in Sydney, despite City winning the game 47–3.\nDuke and Sigsworth were involved in one of the most memorable bungles in State of Origin history. With the series poised on a knife's edge and the score at 5-all, Sigsworth scrambled to field a Lewis kick in the Blues in-goal. Trapped by Second-rower Paul McCabe, Sigsworth threw a pass to Duke who fumbled the ball, and Wally Lewis dived on it for a try that rocked the Blues. However, Qld should not have had the ball at all at that stage. Referee Wilson had penalised Blues halfback Steve Mortimer for a second-row scrum feed 10 metres out from the Maroons try line. In a complete foul-up, Wilson had somehow penalised the wrong man as it was actually Qld halfback Mark Murray who had fed the scrum. When Motrimer protested his innocence, Wilson then marched the Blues 10 metres downfield for backchat. It was at the end of the following set of tackles where Lewis put in his kick leading to the Blues fateful fumble. Blues coach Stanton however refused to blame Wilson for the error, or lay blame with Sigsworth and Duke, instead claiming that errors throughout the game had cost NSW victory. Incredibly, NSW failed to complete 27 sets of 6 tackles during the game, often handing Qld the ball in an attacking position.\nQueensland went on to win 10–5, claiming the first three-match series 2–1 and their first interstate series win over New South Wales since 1960. Lewis won the first of his record total of eight man-of-the-match awards and beginning a run of five Origin best player awards in six games.\nQueensland squads.\nThe 21 players selected by Queensland:"

The club currently plays in Serie B.\nHistory.\nThe Rugby Roma was founded on 21 October 1930, from the ashes of A.S. Roma Rugby (1929) and S.S. Lazio Rugby (1927), clubs associated with the football clubs of the Italian capital, when, after two seasons bankruptcy, under the management of the football clubs the decision was taken to form a separate organisation devoted to rugby. The colours adopted were those of the Club Atlético San Isidro: black and white.\nThe new team were soon successful, winning the Italian championship in the 1934–35 season and again in 1936–37, before financial difficulties restricted ambitions during the war years. In 1937 the team is incorporated into A.S. Roma and reconstituted in 1940 like Amatori Rugby Roma.\nIn 1945 the club returns to the name of Rugby Roma for a year before merging with the Olympic '44 (a rugby club based in Rome) and become Rugby Roma Olimpic. This resurgent post war team were champions again in 1947–48 and 1948–49, before further lean years throughout the 1950s and 1960s, during which the team were relegated.\nThe subsequent years saw the arrival of a new coach Dick Greenwood during the 1970s. The club also toured East Africa in 1976, playing games against teams like East Africa and Scorpions RFC. Rugby Roma Olimpic qualified for the Italian playoffs in 1985, before further difficulties resulted in another relegation.\nThe next boom period led to All Blacks imports, victory in the Coppa Italia in 1998 and a fifth Italian championship in 2000 before yet another financial crisis resulted in relegation once more.\nIn the last 2010–11 Excellence season Rugby Roma Olimpic's head coaches were Danie de Villiers and Jaco Stoumann led the team to conquer the Excellence Trophy. In 2011 the club is disbanded. In the same year the name is changed to Rugby Roma Olimpic 1930, but without participating in any league.\nIn 2015 the new Rugby Roma Olimpic Club 1930 compete in 2015–16 Serie C season, conquering the promotion to Serie B.

        "title": "1983 State of Origin series",
        "text": "The 1983 State of Origin series was the second time the annual three-game series between the New South Wales and Queensland rugby league teams was played entirely under \"state of origin\" selection rules.\nAfter the Australian team had swept all before them in 1982, including sweeping New Zealand in the mid-season tests, before embarking on the highly successful 1982 Kangaroo tour where they became the first touring side to go through undefeated, winning all three Ashes tests against Great Britain and the two tests against France, the 1983 State of Origin series was billed as something of an unofficial World Championship. The winning state would have bragging rights over who had the best representative team in the world outside of the test team.\nGame I.\nGame I of 1983 was refereed by Barry Gomersall, his second Origin fixture following Game II, 1982. Penrith's Darryl Brohman was making his Origin debut and with his ball skills and strong kicking game had been considered a strong possibility to force his way into the Australian side due to play New Zealand a few days later. Early in the first half Brohman's jaw was broken by a sickening elbow from Blues' second-rower Les Boyd which sidelined him for the rest of the season. Gomersall awarded a penalty for the high shot, but allowed Boyd to stay on the field.\nBoyd was later cited by the judiciary and received a twelve-month suspension - the first of two massive barrings that eventually saw him relocate his career to England. It was to be Boyd's last representative appearance after 17 Tests and two Kangaroo Tours. Brohman meanwhile spent three months on the sideline nursing the injury and never represented Australia.\nOn the scoreboard Wally Lewis took control of the match. He scored twice in the first half and with Mal Meninga landing the conversions and potting three penalty goals, the Maroons lead 18-0 after 30 minutes and were able to ward off a spirited New South Wales comeback.\nGame II.\nFor Game II of the series, every member of the Blues' backline came from the defending premiers, the Parramatta Eels, with the exception of Eastern Suburbs fullback Marty Gurr. Players were required to represent their clubs in the season rounds between Origin clashes and a number of New South Wales players from Game I were injured in that weekend's round and unavailable for Game II. The Eels backline consisted of Neil Hunt and Eric Grothe (wings), Mick Cronin and Steve Ella (centres), Brett Kenny (five-eighth) and Peter Sterling (halfback). The club also provided lock forward Ray Price and replacement forward Stan Jurd giving them eight of the Blues' 15 players, the highest ever single club representation for NSW in Origin history.\nThe match became a battle of attrition on a muddy SCG and the Blues kept the series alive with a 10-6 victory in which the Parramatta connection scored all the points - tries to Hunt and Ella, converted by Cronin. For Queensland Mal Meninga scored and converted a try. Queensland had a chance to take the lead when captain Wally Lewis crossed next to the posts midway through the second half, but referee John Gocher ruled obstruction against Gene Miles and disallowed the try.\nKangaroo tour test halfback Peter Sterling continued his ongoing selection battle with Canterbury-Bankstown half Steve Mortimer and fully repaid the selectors' confidence masterfully orchestrating the Blues' play and winning the first of his four Origin man-of-the-match awards. When Mortimer did come on in the second half it was actually on the wing replacing an injured Eric Grothe, though it did not take him long to get involved in the game as an extra half for the Blues.\nGame III.\nThe series decider at Lang Park was billed as \"the clash of the decade\" but Lewis was brilliant and the game was never a contest. Queensland led 21-0 at half-time and 33-0 before the Blues scored four late consolation tries.\nThe 43-22 Maroons victory was the biggest since 1955 and set the standing record for the most points scored by Queensland in an Origin match and also featured another record - the first time three tries were scored by a single player in an Origin match (by Blues' winger Chris Anderson). Another record was set a week later when Queensland had nine players selected in the Australian side to meet the Kiwis.\nPeter Sterling missed the deciding game due to injury and with Steve Mortimer nipping at his heels it proved an expensive absence enabling Mortimer to go on to retain the New South Wales position, win back his Australian jumper and keep Sterling at bay in their representative rivalry for the next two years."

At Trinity Valley he won a NJCAA National Football Championship and was named NJCAA National Coach of the Year in 1997. From 2009 to 2017, Conley was assistant athletic director for football operations and on-campus recruiting coordinator at University of North Texas, working under three head coaches, Todd Dodge, Dan McCarney, and Seth Littrell.\nEarly life.\nConley was a standout athlete at Winnsboro High School and accepted a scholarship from the Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas, where he played on the freshmen varsity in 1966 before transferring to East Texas State (now Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce). He graduated from East Texas State with a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1970 and later a master's degree in higher education. He then became assistant coach at the high school level. In 1977, he served as offensive coordinator on the Plano Senior High School squad that won a 4A state championship.\nEarly college coaching career.\nConley moved up to the collegiate ranks, becoming running backs coach under Tom Wilson at Texas A&amp;M in 1980, coaching three future NFL Draft picks over two seasons. After Wilson was fired in 1982, Conley moved on to coach the running backs at the University of Texas at Austin under coach Fred Akers. During his five-year tenure with the Longhorns, the team won the Southwest Conference championship in 1983, and Conley's linebackers featured two All-Americans and five NFL Draft picks. After successive one-year stints the University of Kansas in 1987, the University of Tennessee in 1988, and Rice University in 1989, Conley spent three seasons, from 1990 to 1992 as an assistant the University of Arkansas.\nFollowing three seasons as an assistant at Howard Payne University, Conley got his first head coaching position at Trinity Valley Community College in Athens, Texas in 1996. In 1997, he guided the Cardinals to a perfect 12–0 season, including a Red River Bowl victory over Garden City Community College. He was named the NJCAA National Coach of the Year and \"American Football Quarterly\" Junior College Coach of the Year. Conley left Trinity Valley in 2000 for the United States Naval Academy, where he coached the special teams for two years before moving into private business.\nTexas A&amp;M University–Commerce.\nIn December 2003, Conley was introduced at his alma mater, Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce, as the school's 17th head football coach after former coach, Eddie Brister announced his retirement. Conley had a tall order as the Lions were coming off their one of their worst seasons in school history and a stagnant offense. Conley brought Valdosta State transfer quarterback Buster Faulkner to Commerce and he led the Lone Star Conference in passing. Conley fielded competitive teams during his tenure in Commerce, but in his five years worked for four athletic directors and had three teams that went 5–5, with the only championship of any kind coming in 2007 as the Lions won the North Division of the Lone Star Conference. After finishing 5–5 again in 2008, Conley was relieved of his duties and replaced by former Baylor University coach Guy Morriss.\nNorth Texas.\nConley was named the director of football operations at the University of North Texas in the spring of 2009."

        "title": "Austria v West Germany (1978 FIFA World Cup)",
        "text": "Córdoba 1978 (known in Austria as \"Das Wunder von Córdoba\" (The Miracle of Córdoba) and in Germany as \"Die Schmach von Córdoba\" or \"Die Schande von Córdoba\" (The Disgrace of Córdoba)), describes the game of football between Austria and defending World Champions West Germany that occurred on 21 June 1978 at the conclusion of the second round of the 1978 FIFA World Cup, in Córdoba, Argentina.\nThe game is fondly remembered by fans of the Austria national team for being the first time in 47 years that Austria had defeated a team from either the Western or Eastern side of the then-partitioned Germany.\nThe build-up.\nIn the first round, Austria had surprisingly won their group, ahead of Brazil even though they had lost to them. A rather lacklustre West Germany had only finished second in their group, following two scoreless draws. While the West German team still contained a number of players who had contributed to winning the 1974 World Cup, others had retired from the national team, being dissatisfied with the old-fashioned attitude of German Football Association (DFB) leaders and coach Helmut Schön, who at age 62 was about to retire after the tournament.\nIn the second round, the Austrians lost their first two games, against the Netherlands (1–5) and Italy (0–1), which meant that they were already eliminated from contention before the last game. The West Germans had managed another two draws against the Dutch (opponents in the 1974 final) and the Italians (opponents in the 1970 semi-final, the so-called Game of the Century).\nThe final group games of the second round gave West Germany and Italy the opportunity to determine directly who would advance to the Final. If their simultaneous games (both at 13:45 local time) ended in a draw (there was no extra-time or penalty shootout, as it was a group stage game), then the Netherlands would progress to the final and Italy would qualify for the third-place match. A draw between the Dutch and the Italians combined with a decisive five goal victory by West Germany over Austria would give the West Germans the advantage over the Dutch, and a berth in the Final. If the Netherlands–Italy game had a winner, West Germany could still qualify for the third place match by beating Austria, or in case of an Italian loss (or Netherlands loss by at least four goals), even with a draw.\nSecond round, Group A\nMatch summary.\nIn both games, the first goal was scored in the 19th minute, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge scoring for West Germany and Ernie Brandts scoring for Italy with an own goal. When the Dutch equalised in the 49th minute, the West Germans were still four goals shy of advancing to the final. Then Berti Vogts scored in the 59th minute, but in his own net. Hans Krankl then scored to put Austria ahead, but Bernd Hölzenbein equalised for West Germany a few minutes later. When the Dutch scored what transpired to be their winning goal in the 76th minute, the West Germans were placed second in the group, ahead of the Italians, having a goal tally of 4–4, compared to the lesser 2–2 of Italy. West German fans could look forward to the third place match, until Krankl scored in the 87th minute to put Austria 3–2 ahead. The Germans were not able to score in the remaining minutes, and, having also now been eliminated, joined the Austrians on their already pre-arranged flight home.\nThe commentary provided during the last few minutes of the game by Edi Finger, and in particular his exclamation following Krankl's goal \"Tor! Tor! Tor! Tor! Tor! Tor! I wer' narrisch!\" are familiar to most Austrians and Germans from being repeated many times on radio and television. Although the Cordoba game was not a World Cup final, in Austrian popular culture Finger's commentary is comparable with Herbert Zimmermann's famous commentary at the end of the 1954 World Cup Final, between West Germany and Hungary, the game often called the Miracle of Bern.\nA translation of Finger's commentary follows:\n\"[Krankl] is in the box. He shoots! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! I am going bonkers! Krankl has scored. It is 3–2 to Austria! Ladies and gentlemen, we are hugging each other here, Rippel, my colleague, graduate engineer Posch, we're kissing each other ... 3–2 to Austria, by our Krankl's magnificent goal. He beat all of them. And just wait a minute, wait a minute and perhaps we can pour ourselves a small glass of wine. That's something you have to have seen. I'm standing up now, the South American [crowd]. I think we have beaten them! However, the Germans attack again, watch out, headed away again. The ball goes to the left, to Pezzey, Pezzey, but lads, don't break down back there, stay upright! Still two minutes to go, the ball's with the Austrians, but we don't want to jinx it. There is a cross into the box, but Kreuz has rescued it again!\nGermany are sending everyone up front. A chance for the Germans! Well? It is wide! Oh, Abramczik, I'd like to kiss Abramczik for it. He really helped us -- alone in front of the goal. Brave Abramczik has shot wide. The poor guy will fret. 30 seconds to go. 3–2 to Austria. After 47 years, ladies and gentlemen, an Austrian national team, but what a team, a world class team that's performing today, is in the lead 3–2 against the Federal Republic. And I don't dare to watch anymore. The ball's kicked out of the match. Referee Klein from Israel, a truly outstanding referee; it was not easy for him today, but he performed magnificently up to now. 45th minute, once again the ball's with Germany and Prohaska kicks it away. And now it is over! It's over, it's finished, it's done, it's over! Germany have been beaten, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in 47 years, Austria have defeated Germany.\"\nAftermath.\nWest German fans were dissatisfied with the performance and attitude of their 1978 team, contrasted with the Austrians, who fought fiercely with their neighbours in a game that had no significance to Austria in terms of further progression in the tournament. Finger's phrase \"I wer' narrisch!\" (\"I'm going crazy!\") became the slogan of several marketing and advertising campaigns.\nWith a new coach, Jupp Derwall, the West Germans went on to win the 1980 European championship. Then in 1982, at the next World Cup in Spain, West Germany and Austria met again, in a final group-stage game in Gijón. This time, the West Germans had to win to avoid elimination from the tournament, but doing so by one or two goals would send both teams through to the next round at the expense of Algeria, who had beaten West Germany 2–1 in the first game of the group. Hence, after West Germany scored early, the two teams kicked the ball around aimlessly for the rest of the match, in stark contrast to 1978, and to worldwide howls of derision. The game was subsequently dubbed the \"Nichtangriffspakt von Gijón\" (Non-aggression Pact of Gijón).\nSince that match in 1982, Germany has played in five World Cup finals, whilst Austria has only qualified for two World Cups (1990 and 1998), going out in the group stage both times. Austria also played the by now re-unified Germany at Euro 2008, co-hosted between Austria and Switzerland. On this occasion, Germany defeated Austria 1–0 to qualify for the next round and knock the co-hosts out of the tournament.\nOn 16 May 2008, exactly one month before the Euro 2008 group match between Austria and Germany, the Swiss performance artist staged a one-man re-enactment of the 1978 World Cup match between the sides in front of 2,500 spectators at Rapid Vienna's stadium. Furlan imitated Hans Krankl's match performance and goal celebrations, with reproducing his father's famous radio commentary of the match."

        "text": "The Gonzaga Bulldogs are an intercollegiate men's basketball program representing Gonzaga University. The school competes in the West Coast Conference in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Gonzaga Bulldogs play home basketball games at the McCarthey Athletic Center in Spokane, Washington, on the university campus.\nGonzaga has had 15 of its players receive the WCC Player of the Year award, and two players, Frank Burgess in 1961 with 32.4 points per game, and Adam Morrison in 2006 with 28.1 points per game, have led the nation in scoring. Morrison was named the Co-National Player of the year for the 2005–06 season.\nSince the mid-1990s, Gonzaga has established itself as a major basketball power in a mid-major conference. They have been to every NCAA tournament held since 1999, a year in which they made a Cinderella run to the Elite Eight, and have appeared in every final AP poll since the 2008–09 season. Gonzaga had an active weekly poll streak of 143 weeks, starting from the 2016–17 season and ending on January 15, 2024, being tied for the tenth longest streak in Division I history. They have also appeared in all but one WCC conference title game since 1995, and in every conference title game since 1998, winning 16 of them. This culminated in 2016–17, when the Bulldogs went to their first Final Four in school history, advancing to the national championship game, where they lost to North Carolina. They returned to the Final Four in 2021, losing in the national championship game to Baylor.\nTeam history.\nEarly years.\nGonzaga introduced a basketball program during the 1907–08 basketball season and, although the season wasn't an official one, they achieved a record of under head coach George Varnell. In the 1908–09 season, Varnell became the first official coach for Gonzaga, earning a record. William Mulligan coached the following season and acquired an record. Frank McKevitt took over for Mulligan during the 1910–11 basketball season, acquiring an record. From 1944 to 1994, the Bulldogs compiled a record of , earning regular season titles in 1965–66 and 1966–67 (Big Sky) under Hank Anderson, and in 1993–94 (WCC) under Dan Fitzgerald. That season also saw the team qualify for its first postseason tournament, the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), while being led by point guard Geoff Goss, who averaged 12.6 points per game that season. In the following season, the fourth-seeded Bulldogs won the WCC tournament to secure their first appearance in the NCAA tournament.\nDan Monson (1997–1999).\nIn 1997, Gonzaga assistant coach Dan Monson, the son of veteran Oregon and Idaho head coach Don Monson, became the head coach of Gonzaga as Fitzgerald wanted to focus on his athletic director's duties. During his first season, Monson led the Zags to a 24–10 record and a WCC regular season title, which was not enough to land an at-large bid in the NCAA tournament. They earned a bid into the NIT and beat Wyoming 69–55 in the first round in Laramie, but fell at Hawai'i 78–70 in the second round.\nDuring the 1998–99 season, the Bulldogs had a 28–7 record after winning the conference tournament, and were seeded tenth in the West regional of the NCAA tournament. In the tournament's \"Cinderella\" run and Gonzaga's \"coming out party\" (Gonzaga has made the NCAA tournament each year since) the Zags beat seventh-seeded Minnesota 75–63 in the first round in Seattle and followed it with an 82–74 win over second-seeded Stanford to advance to the regional semifinals in Phoenix. Gonzaga beat Florida 73–72 to advance to the regional finals after Casey Calvary tipped in the winning basket with four seconds remaining. They trailed eventual national champion UConn by one point with a minute remaining before losing 67–62 in the regional finals.\nMark Few (1999–present).\nAfter Monson departed for Minnesota that summer, assistant coach Mark Few was promoted to head coach on July 26, 1999.\nIn his inaugural season, Few led the Zags to a 26–9 record, which was highlighted by winning the WCC tournament and advancing to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament with wins over Louisville and St. John's in Tucson, Arizona.\nIn the 2000–01 season, the Bulldogs faced a tough schedule highlighted by games against Arizona, Washington, Florida, and New Mexico. Despite starting the season 5–1, the Zags dropped four of their next five games. Gonzaga rebounded and finished the regular season 15–6 before winning their third consecutive WCC tournament title. The win gave the Bulldogs an automatic bid into the NCAA tournament, where they were seeded twelfth in the South regional. In the first round in Memphis against fifth-seeded Virginia, Casey Calvary put back a blocked shot with nine seconds left to give the Zags an 86–85 victory. Gonzaga then beat 13th-seeded Indiana State 85–68 in the second round to advance to their third consecutive Sweet 16. In Atlanta, the Zags lost to defending national champion Michigan State 77–62 and finished the season with a 26–7 record.\nPrior to the 2001–02 season, the Bulldogs were unanimously favored to win the WCC title in the WCC preseason coaches poll. Few led the Zags to a share of the WCC regular season title, as Pepperdine also had a 13–1 conference record. The Bulldogs would avenge their only conference loss of the season by defeating Pepperdine 96–90 for their fourth straight WCC tournament title. The win gave the Zags an automatic bid as a six-seed in the NCAA tournament, opening against 11th-seeded Wyoming. Despite beating the Cowboys four years earlier in the NIT, they lost 73–66, marking the first time the Zags lost in the first round of the tournament under Mark Few.\nIn the 2002–03 season, Few led the Bulldogs to their fifth regular season title in six years with a 12–2 conference record. Despite this, Gonzaga lost to San Diego in the WCC tournament championship game 72–63, marking the first time the Zags had lost in the championship game in four years. Gonzaga garnered a nine-seed in the 2003 NCAA tournament, where they beat Cincinnati 74–69 to advance to the second round of the tournament for the fourth time in five years. The Bulldogs would go on to lose to Arizona 96–95 in double overtime to finish 24–9.\nThe 2003–04 season marked the first time that the team participated in the annual Battle in Seattle game. Gonzaga faced third-ranked Missouri, who was the highest-ranked regular season opponent that the Zags had played against up to that point; they would go on to win the game in an 87–80 overtime victory. This season marked the last time Gonzaga would play home games in the Charlotte Y. Martin Centre; their last game in the building took place February 28, 2004, where they beat Santa Clara 80–64. The win gave the Bulldogs their first undefeated run through the WCC in school history with a 14–0 conference record. Gonzaga would go on to receive an automatic bid into the 2004 NCAA tournament with a two-seed, which was the highest seed they had received in school history in seven tournament appearances. The Bulldogs would go on to beat 15th-seeded Valparaiso 76–49 before being upset in the second round by tenth-seeded Nevada 91–72, where they finished the season 28–3.\nGonzaga opened up the 2004–05 season with a home game against Portland State in the new 6,000-seat McCarthey Athletic Center on November 19, 2004. Despite losing five seniors, including second-round NBA draft pick Blake Stepp, Few was still able to lead the Zags to their ninth regular season title since 1994 with a 12–2 conference record. The Bulldogs would go on to win their second straight WCC Tournament title, giving them an automatic bid into the 2005 NCAA tournament as a three-seed. The Zags beat 14th-seeded Winthrop 74–64 before falling to Texas Tech 71–69 in the second round, where they ended the season with a 26–5 record.\nBefore the 2005–06 season got underway, Gonzaga junior Adam Morrison became the first player in team history to be named to the preseason Associated Press All-America team. The Zags also received their highest preseason ranking in program history at number seven in the \"USA Today\"/ESPN preseason poll. The Bulldogs captured their third straight WCC Tournament title when they beat Loyola Marymount 68–67 in the championship game. They received an automatic bid into the 2006 NCAA tournament as a three-seed, where they beat Xavier 79–75 in the first round. The Zags would go on to beat Indiana Hoosiers 90–80, where they would advance to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2001. Despite being ahead by as many as 17 points, the Bulldogs ended their season in the Sweet 16 by losing to UCLA 73–71, finishing 29–4.\nThe 2006–07 season marked the first time that the Zags suffered at least ten losses in a season since the 1997–98 season. Despite this, Few still led the Bulldogs to their seventh straight regular season title with a conference record of 11–3. Gonzaga would go on to win the WCC Tournament for the fourth year in a row, being the only Division I school to do so that year. They received an automatic bid into the 2007 NCAA tournament, where they were given a 10-seed. The Zags would end their season by losing in the opening round for the first time since 2001, as Indiana beat Gonzaga 70–57.\nIn 2007–08 the Bulldogs went 25–8, but lost in the Round of 64 as a #7 seed to a Davidson team that went to the Elite Eight as a #10 seed.\nThe 2008–09 team won both the WCC Regular Season Championship and the WCC Tournament Championship. Entering the NCAA tournament as a #4 seed, the team reached the Sweet Sixteen, before losing to eventual NCAA Champions North Carolina.\nFor the next five seasons, the team advanced to the NCAA tournament, but fell in the Round of 32 each time. The 2012–13 team became the first Gonzaga squad to be ranked as the #1 team in the country and was awarded as a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament for the first time. The Zags also won over 30 games for the first time in program history with a 32–3 overall record.\nThe 2014–15 team advanced all the way to the Elite Eight before losing to eventual national champion Duke. This was the first time since 1999 that Gonzaga had advanced to the Elite Eight. Gonzaga also won the WCC regular-season and tournament championships for the third consecutive season. The 2014–15 also set the school record for wins in a single season with 35.\nThe 2015–16 team suffered 4 losses at home and nearly missed the NCAA tournament entirely, but shared the WCC regular-season crown with Saint Mary's and then won the WCC Tournament. The Zags were awarded a #11 seed and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, dismantling #6 seed Seton Hall and #3 seed Utah, before falling to Syracuse by three points.\nThe 2016–17 team won its first 29 games, setting a new school record for consecutive games won, before falling to WCC rival BYU. The Zags made the NCAA tournament as a #1 seed and advanced to the school's first-ever championship game, with wins over South Dakota State, Northwestern, West Virginia, Xavier, and South Carolina. The Zags set a new school record for wins in a single season with 37 and also had the most wins of any team that season.\nThe 2017–18 team also enjoyed success. Despite what was considered a \"rebuilding year\" after the Loss of Karnowski, Williams-Goss, Mathews and Collins among others (causing the Bulldogs to not be picked to win the West Coast Conference), the team won the WCC regular season title outright before winning the WCC tournament. In the NCAA tournament, the Bulldogs advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for the fourth consecutive year. They were ultimately bounced by Florida State, and finished the season at 32–5.\nNear the end of that season, Gonzaga considered a potential move to the Mountain West Conference (MW) after nearly 40 years as a WCC member. When asked by a reporter from the \"San Diego Union-Tribune\" about rumored MW expansion plans, MW commissioner Craig Thompson confirmed that six schools had been considered, with Gonzaga being the only school he specifically named. A later \"Union-Tribune\" report indicated that talks were advanced enough that the conference's presidents planned a vote on an invitation to Gonzaga during the MW men's and women's basketball tournaments in Las Vegas, but decided to delay the vote until after the Final Four. The vote ultimately never took place, as Gonzaga athletic director Mike Roth notified both conferences during the Final Four that the school would remain in the WCC for the immediate future.\nIn the 2018 Maui Invitational Final on November 21, 2018 #3 Gonzaga defeated #1 Duke 89–87 for their first win over Duke and first win over a number 1 ranked team in team history.\nThe 2020–21 season would be a historic year for the team, going 26–0 in the regular season and being the final undefeated team in the country. They would earn the #1 overall seed in the tournament and cruise to the national championship game over Norfolk State, Oklahoma, Creighton, USC, and UCLA. In the national championship, their undefeated season came to an end, losing to Baylor 86–70.\nFacilities.\nBasketball started at Gonzaga in February 1905 after a gymnasium was put in as an addition to the east end of the new college building that was being built. In 1955, the basketball team moved from the gymnasium, nicknamed \"the cave\", and began to play at the newly constructed Spokane Coliseum. On June 3, 1964, construction began for a new 3,800-seat athletic facility called the John F. Kennedy Memorial Pavilion. To raise money for the $1.1 million project, Gonzaga's student body had each student pay $10 per semester until $500,000 was raised. The university matched that amount, while the remaining $100,000 came from contributions. Gonzaga's first game in the pavilion took place on December 3, 1965, against Washington State, who beat the Bulldogs 106–78. In 1986, the facility was renamed the Charlotte Y. Martin Centre after an eponymous donor donated $4.5 million to finance a remodel of the arena that could hold up to 4,000 people.\nAfter competing for over 39 years in the Charlotte Y. Martin Centre, Gonzaga trustees approved construction for a new 6,000-seat arena on April 11, 2003. The McCarthey Athletic Center was named after Gonzaga trustee Philip G. McCarthey and Gonzaga regent Thomas K. McCarthey, who contributed a significant portion of the funds needed to build the arena. The first official game took place on November 19, 2004, against Portland State, whom the Zags would beat 98–80 in front of a sold-out crowd. The Bulldogs opened the arena with a 38-game winning streak, which was the nation's longest active winning streak at the time. When combined with 12 wins at the Charlotte Y. Martin Centre, the overall home-game winning streak ended at 50 games with a loss to the Santa Clara on February 12, 2007. In February 2015, BYU snapped Gonzaga's 41-game home winning streak in the McCarthey Athletic Center, which was also the longest active home winning streak in the NCAA at the time.\nThrough February 6, 2020, the Zags are in the McCarthey Athletic Center, which includes a record in non-conference games, a record in conference games, and a record in the WCC Tournament.\nTraditions.\nBattle in Seattle.\nOn December 13, 2003, Gonzaga participated in a neutral court game at KeyArena that would later become an annual event known as the Battle in Seattle. The event marked the first time that a regular season Gonzaga basketball game was broadcast nationally on CBS Sports, as Craig Bolerjack called the action while Clark Kellogg provided commentary. Ranked third in the country, Missouri was the highest ranked regular season opponent that Gonzaga had faced up to that point; the Bulldogs would go on to beat the Tigers 87–80 in overtime.\nThe 2005 Battle in Seattle is remembered for Adam Morrison's game-winning shot against Oklahoma State that sealed a 64–62 victory for the Bulldogs. Gus Johnson's call at the end of the game with Bill Raftery was ranked fourth on a list of 25 of his most \"over-the-top calls\" by \"Complex\". Johnson's call at the end of the game:\nIn 2008, the game broke the state attendance record for a regular season college basketball game, as a sold-out crowd of 16,763 watched the Bulldogs play Connecticut.\nIn the 2016–17 season, Gonzaga failed to schedule the Battle in Seattle, ending an annual tradition of participating in the event every December for 13 consecutive years. Representatives from the Zags cited an inability to find a quality opponent to schedule and wanting to maintain strong résumé. The Zags have compiled an record in the event since they first appeared in it back in 2003.\nRivalries.\nSaint Mary's College (California).\nGonzaga's biggest rivalry is with fellow West Coast Conference foe Saint Mary's. Many analysts and members of the media have touted the Gaels vs. Zags as one of the best, if not the best, college basketball rivalry on the West Coast, as both teams have been consistently the two top teams in the conference over the last 2 decades. Gonzaga and Saint Mary's have combined to win 19 out of the last 23 conference championship games (Gonzaga 17, San Diego 2, Saint Mary's 2). Currently Gonzaga leads the series 72–31.\nWashington.\nGonzaga's most heated in-state rivalry is with Washington. They played a 10-year home-and-home series from 1997 to 2006, but then it went dormant until 2015. In 2016, they began a new home-and-home series in Spokane and have agreed to continue the rivalry annually until at least the 2023–24 season. The Huskies lead the series 30–20. Although the Zags have won 14 of the last 16 matchups, the most recent game was won by Washington on December 9, 2023, 78–73.\nBrigham Young University.\nA notable rivalry with Brigham Young University (BYU) has developed throughout the past decade. BYU and Gonzaga first played on December 16, 1949, with Gonzaga winning 46–41. The two teams would not meet again until March 19, 2011, in the third round of the NCAA tournament, as a BYU team led by Jimmer Fredette advanced to the Sweet Sixteen by defeating the Zags 89–67. The following season, BYU left the Mountain West Conference and joined the West Coast Conference for the 2011–2012 season. Since then, Gonzaga has a 18–6 record against BYU. However, BYU is one of few teams to win multiple times at the McCarthy Athletic Center in Spokane over the last decade, with wins at the Kennel in 2015, 2016 and 2017. BYU was the only team to beat #1 ranked Gonzaga during the 2016–17 regular season in which Gonzaga earned its first trip to the Final Four and National Championship game. BYU has played Gonzaga in the West Coast Conference tournament Final in 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2021 with Gonzaga winning all four of these matchups. Gonzaga leads the overall series 20–7, with the most recent meeting on March 9, 2021, in which Gonzaga won 88–78 in Las Vegas.\nWashington State.\nWashington State leads the series against Gonzaga 57–32, while the Bulldogs won the last meeting against the Cougars 69–60 in 2015. Now in 2024 the Cougars alongside Oregon state are set to join Gonzaga in the WCC for the next two seasons in basketball, cross country, and golf.\nImpact.\nUniversity enrollment.\nFreshman enrollment at Gonzaga in the mid-nineties hovered around 500 students annually, including a total of 569 as late as 1998. In 1999, enrollment jumped to 701 five months after the Zags went to the Elite Eight. This trend continued after Gonzaga won five games in the 1999 and 2000 NCAA tournaments, as freshman enrollment increased to 796 in 2000 and to a then-record 979 in 2001. A 65 percent increase in the size of the freshman class between 1997 and 2003 is part of a phenomenon called the Flutie effect, the increase in attention and applications for admission that results after a particularly notable and unexpected sporting victory by a school's athletic team. Gonzaga University president Rev. Robert Spitzer said that the team's success was responsible for the school receiving the $23 million required to build the McCarthey Athletic Center, most of which was received through major gifts.\nGonzaga has been viewed as reaping benefits from its basketball-related exposure to this day. The university's financial position and fundraising success dramatically improved. This led to a campus building boom; the McCarthey Athletic Center proved to be just the first of a series of major campus buildings that opened between 2004 and 2017. Booming freshman enrollment led Gonzaga to introduce a more selective admissions process in 2003, which led to a significant increase in the academic credentials of incoming freshmen. Even with greater selectivity, freshman enrollment has continued to grow, reaching 1,200 for 2016–17.\nSeason-by-season results.\nUnder Mark Few:\nGonzaga vs. the AP Top 25 (since 1998–99).\nSince the season of Gonzaga's 1999 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament run to the Elite 8, Gonzaga has played a total of 132 games against teams ranked in the AP Top 25 Poll. Gonzaga has a record of against such teams. They have beaten top-3 teams seven times in all, taking down #3 teams four times (Missouri in 2003–04, Georgia Tech and Oklahoma State in 2004–05, and Iowa in 2020–21), #2 twice (North Carolina in 2006–07 and UCLA in 2021–22), and #1 once (Duke in 2018–19).\nTeams in bold represent games Gonzaga played in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe Bulldogs have appeared in 26 NCAA tournaments. The COVID-19 pandemic caused the cancellation of the 2020 NCAA tournament. This interrupted, but did not end, the Bulldogs' ongoing streak of 25 consecutive tournament appearances, including 9 straight Sweet 16 appearances. Gonzaga's combined record is . \nNCAA tournament seeding history.\n\"The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\"\nNIT results.\nThe Bulldogs have appeared in three National Invitation Tournaments (NIT).

Of these, five have started their college basketball careers with the Bulldogs—Zach Collins, Jalen Suggs, Hunter Sallis, Chet Holmgren, and Nolan Hickman. Suggs was selected for the 2020 McDonald's All-American game, which was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 McDonald's All-American game, to which Hickman and Holmgren were selected, was also canceled due to COVID-19.\n5-star recruits.\nTwelve 5-star rated players have committed to Gonzaga, as rated in the final ranking projections by at least one major college basketball recruiting service (247Sports.com, ESPN.com, Rivals.com, and Scout.com). Among these players, eight began their college careers with the Bulldogs: Austin Daye, Domantas Sabonis, Zach Collins, Oumar Ballo, Jalen Suggs, Nolan Hickman, Chet Holmgren, and Hunter Sallis. Only Ballo did not make his debut immediately after his arrival at Gonzaga; he was to have debuted in the 2019–20 season, but was not academically cleared to play by the NCAA and was redshirted that season.\nPlayers in the NBA.\nIn this table, seasons at Gonzaga are categorized by the calendar years in which they end.\nRetired numbers.\nGonzaga has retired five jersey numbers."

The Jones Cup was the inter-county tournament in Guyana for many years until the name was changed to that of the new sponsors of the competition, Guystac. The final, only, was a first class match during the 1970s and 1980s.\nThe name Demerara was often used when referring to the whole of British Guiana in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, resulting in some confusion for students of cricket history.

There were a total number of 32 participating athletes, with two qualifying groups and the final held on Thursday August 10, 1995.\nThis event was jumping in the same facility as Jonathan Edwards had set the still standing world record for men just three days earlier. Over the course of his series, Edwards had added 32 cm to Willie Banks' previous record that had stood for over a decade. The leader from the qualifying round was former world record holder Iolanda Chen.\nThe final started uneventfully with Rodica Mateescu taking the lead with 14.44m. The second round intensified with world record holder and defending champion Anna Biryukova jumping 14.85m to take the lead and Iva Prandzheva moving into second with a 14.76m.\nThe third round became eventful. Biryukova jumped 15.08m, within one cm of her existing world record. Meanwhile Inessa Kravets had fouled on her first two attempts, and a third foul would mean she was eliminated from the competition with no mark.\nShe adjusted her run up to be sure she would make a legal jump. Giving up almost the entire 20 cm width of the take off board, she took off at the back of the board. On three smooth, elongated steps she flew well past the 15 metre mark into the pit. The jump was measured at , adding 41 cm to the existing world record - like Edwards, a Beamonesque improvement. Erom where she took off, the jump was closer to 15.78m.\nThe competition continued. In the fourth round, Inna Lasovskaya jumped 14.85m to move into third place. In the fifth round Prandzheva jumped past Lasovskaya and Biryukova with a 15.18m, at that point in time, the second best jump in history only to the world record set minutes earlier. And in the final round, Prandzheva again jumped 15.00m exactly, only her second best jump of the day.\nAlmost a year later, Kravets showed her jump was not a fluke, jumping 15.33m to win at the 1996 Olympics; Prandzheva was disqualified at those Olympics for a doping violation. Kravets was unable to defend her Olympic title in 2000 because she was suspended for the second time in her career for a doping violation.\nAt the 2020 Olympics, Yulimar Rojas of Venezuela jumped 15.67m on her final jump to finally break Kravets' world record after 26 years.\nQualifying round.\nQualification: Qualifying Performance 14.05 (Q) or at least 12 best performers (q) advance to the final."

Skil-Sem was the team with which the team's leader, Sean Kelly, dominated the sport in 1984. Another team member, the French rider Éric Caritoux, also won the Vuelta a España in 1984. The team was directed by Jean de Gribaldy.\nHistory.\nIn 1984, Skil, a manufacturer of small power tools, became main sponsor of the Sem-France Loire team, directed by Jean de Gribaldy. As a member of Sem-France Loire, Kelly had twice won Paris–Nice and had won the points classification in the Tour de France two times. Kelly also won the Giro di Lombardia for the team in 1983.\nDuring the 1984 season the team was called Skil-Sem-Mavic-Reydel and was directed by de Gribaldy and Christian Rumeau. Kelly dominated racing that spring and won 33 times in total. He won, amongst others, Paris–Roubaix, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, Blois–Chaville, the GP Ouest-France and the Grand Prix de Fourmies. Also that Spring, Éric Caritoux won the Vuelta a España. Earlier in the season, he had won the stage to Mont Ventoux in Paris–Nice (and Kelly won the overall) but the team did not enter the Vuelta a España with high ambitions. Caritoux won by six seconds.\nThe following year, several of the smaller co-sponsors changed and the team was called Skil-Reydel-Sem. During 1985, Kelly won Paris–Nice, the Giro di Lombardia, finished fourth in the 1985 Tour de France and won the points classification. Gerrie Knetemann won the Amstel Gold Race and Jean-Claude Leclercq became French road race champion. At the end of 1985, de Gribaldy found a new sponsor to replace Skil. Kas, a Spanish maker of soft drinks which had sponsored a team in the 1970s became the main sponsor.\nThe bikes used by the team had a Vitus 979 aluminium or a Vitus carbon fibre frame, both labelled \"de Gribaldy\", with Mavic components."

        "text": "Alcyon was a French professional cycling team that was active from 1905 to 1959, and returned in 1961 and 1962. It was started by Alcyon, a French bicycle, automobile and motorcycle manufacturer.\nHistory.\nThe team won the Tour de France four times before World War I with François Faber in 1909, Octave Lapize in 1910, Gustave Garrigou in 1911 and Odile Defraye in 1912. Alcyon won the team prize at the Tour de France from 1909 to 1912 and then from 1927 to 1929. In 1909, Calais is de manager of the team and Alphonse Baugé sports directeur. Ludovic Feuillet takes over this position in 1910.\nImmediately after the First World War, Alcyon like many other bicycle companies joined a Consortium that employed many riders under the La Sportive name. This consortium would win the Tour de France from 1919 to 1921. The Consortium stopped in 1922 and the member companies which included Automoto, Peugeot and Alcyon restarted up their separate cycling teams. Alcyon grew into a very strong team that dominated the Tour de France with three wins in with Nicolas Frantz in 1927 and in 1928 and Maurice De Waele in 1929.\nAlcyon dominated the Tour de France during the 1920s. In the 1929 edition, Maurice Dewaele won the race despite the fact that he was sick when the race went through the Alps. This was because no one attacked the Alcyon rider there. The organisers of the Tour de France decided in 1930 that the race would be disputed by national teams. It has been said that this was done to break the domination of some of the commercial teams, most notably Alcyon As a result, Alcyon was unable to continue to dominate the race. However Alycon-Dunlop riders riding for the French national team were able to dominate the race, such as André Leducq, an Alycon-Dunlop rider who won the very first Tour that was disputed by national teams. Leducq would win the Tour again in 1932, while another Alycon rider, Georges Speicher won the Tour again in 1933. Belgians Romain Maes and Sylvère Maes were riders of the team when they won the Tour de France in 1935, 1936 and 1939.\nAfter World War II, the team name changed to Alcyon-BP (1946–1949), which was followed by Alcyon-Dunlop (1950–1954). Alcyon stopped sponsoring the team after 1958, although a team existed for 1961 and 1962, managed by former rider Georges Speicher."

BDO World Champion Martin Adams almost immediately confirmed that he would participate in the Masters. The other top BDO players who had qualified, including Gary Anderson, Scott Waites and Mark Webster competed at the Grand Slam and missed the Masters.\nAdams plus the next seven highest ranked BDO players who hadn't qualified for the Grand Slam were later given seeding positions through to the BBC televised stages of the tournament for the first time."

        "text": "Mercier was a French professional cycling team that promoted and raced on Mercier racing bikes. Together with the Peugeot team, the Mercier team had a long presence in the cycling sport and in the Tour de France from 1935 until 1984.\nHistory.\n was the main sponsor of the team from at least 1935 on until 1969. From 1946 on, the team wore a purple jersey which in 1950 became the characteristic purple jersey with yellow neck and cuff lining which was to stay with the team until Mercier was no longer the main sponsor of the team in 1969. From 1935 to 1955 the team had as second sponsor Hutchinson and was the Mercier-Hutchinson team. From 1956 the team was known as Mercier-BP-Hutchinson which it would continue as until 1969 after which the sponsor Mercier became the second sponsor of the team.\nTwo-time Tour de France champion and 1936 World Champion Antonin Magne finished his career with the Mercier-Hutchinson team in 1941. Around ten years later in 1953, Magne was the main directeur sportif of the team and he would guide the team up until 1970 when the name of the team changed to Fagor-Mercier. Magne guided the team during many successful years. Frenchman Louison Bobet was part of the team in 1955 when he won Tour of Flanders but at this time the Tour de France was disputed by national teams so Mercier did not have the opportunity to ride the Tour as a team. Nevertheless, riders of the team won the Tour in 1937 and 1955.\nDespite being on the team, it appears that Louison Bobet did not wear the \"Mercier-BP-Hutchinson\" jersey but a \"Bobet-BP-Hutchinson\" jersey. This happened during several races and was common practice at the time as can be seen with other sponsors names that took the place of Mercier for example- \"A. Leducq\", \"A,Magne\", \"F.Pelissier\", \"Le Greves\" and \"M.Archambaud\". Examples of the different jerseys can be found on the French website memoire du cyclisme. In this way Bobet was part of the Magne directed Mercier team but he rode his own mark of racing bicycles – \"Louison Bobet bicycles\" and his teams are listed as from 1955 to 1960 as \"Bobet-BP-Hutchinson\".\nAfter Bobet had left the team, Magne directed Frenchman Raymond Poulidor who challenged Jacques Anquetil in the Tour de France but also won many other races including Milan–San Remo and the 1964 Vuelta a España. After his Vuelta win, Poulidor famously battled Anquetil during the 1964 Tour de France and ended the race second overall, 55 seconds behind Anquetil. It was in the purple Mercier jersey with the yellow sleeves that Poulidor battled Anquetil elbow to elbow on the Puy-de-Dôme mountain. Although Poulidor did not win the Tour de France he was more popular than Anquetil with the fans. Poulidor stayed with the Mercier cycling team for his whole career.\nAfter 1969, Mercier became the second sponsor of the team with the Spanish appliances manufacturer Fagor became the main sponsor of the team for two years making the Fagor-Mercier-Hutchinson team. Gan became the main sponsor of the team in 1973 making the Gan-Mercier-Hutchinson team which continued until 1976. During this time, Cyrille Guimard emerged as a contender for stage races, winning the Points classification in the Vuelta a España and leading the competition and sitting second overall in the 1972 Tour de France until the second last day when he was forced to retire with an injury. In that race, Guimard's teammate and the ever-consistent Poulidor finished the race third overall. Guimard's persistent injury affected his career and lead him to early retirement whereas Poulidor continued to perform at the top winning Paris–Nice in 1972 ahead of Merckx and in 1973 ahead of Joop Zoetemelk and Merckx. Poulidor finished the 1974 Tour de France second overall and his final Tour, the 1976 Tour de France in third place. Joop Zoetemelk joined the team in 1974 and stayed with the team until 1980, winning Paris–Nice in 1974, 1975 and 1979 as well as the 1979 Vuelta a España. Zoetemelk challenged Bernard Hinault in the Tour de France in 1978 and 1979, wearing the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification in both editions. In 1980, Zoetemelk changed teams to the TI–Raleigh squad where he won the Tour, and then returned to Mercier in 1982. From 1977 until 1982, Miko were the main sponsor making them the Miko-Mercier-Vivagel team, and for the final two years of the team, during 1982 and 1983, COOP was the other major sponsor making them the COOP-Mercier team."

        "text": "George Eldon Andrews, II (born November 28, 1955) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL). He is a graduate of the University of Nebraska who played in the National Football League (NFL) from 1979 to 1984 for the Los Angeles Rams.\nHigh school.\nAndrews attended Omaha Burke High School in Omaha, Nebraska where he excelled in both football and basketball.\nCollege.\nAndrews was a three-year starter for the Nebraska Cornhuskers at defensive end. As a sophomore, in 1976, he had 49 tackles, six for a loss and recovered two fumbles. The team ended the season defeating the Texas Tech Red Raiders, 27-24 in the 1976 Bluebonnet Bowl. As a junior in 1977, George Andrews made 84 tackles with eight for a loss, knocked down three passes, intercepted one pass and recovered one fumble. For his efforts, he was voted honorable mention All-Big Eight. The 1977 season ended with Nebraska beating the University of North Carolina 21-17 in the Liberty Bowl. In that game, Andrews totaled 19 tackles.\nAs a senior, in 1978, Andrews was a First-team All-American by NEA and \"Football News.\" He was also a Second-team choice on the AP and UPI teams. George Andrew was also a consensus All-Big Eight selection. His statistics were the best of his career, with 84 tackles (good for 3rd on the team) with 10 of those coming behind the line as sacks. Andrews broke up three passes and intercepted another. He ended his career with 217 tackles, with 24 of those totaling 118 yards in losses.\nIn addition, Andrews was an Academic All-American as well with a 3.1 GPA in Business Administration.\nNFL.\nGeorge Andrews was selected as a linebacker in the 1979 NFL draft, the 19th pick overall by the Los Angeles Rams. His tackling prowess, 360-pound bench press and 4.7 40-yard dash speed seemed ideal for a 230-pound NFL outside linebacker, or a stand-up defensive end.\nAs a rookie, Andrews played well on special teams, totaling 33 tackles and a fumble recovery. In 1980, Andrews began the season with a thigh injury, missing three games. However, in the tenth week of the season, starting linebacker Bob Brudzinski left the team and Andrews started the remaining seven games in Brudzinski's place. In the final six games, the Rams defense allowed only 75 points in a defensive surge that helped them to make the playoffs. George Andrews ended the season with 44 tackles, three passes defensed, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery.\nIn 1981, Andrews was the Rams' starter all season at right linebacker. He was the Rams' fifth leading tackler with 75, with three going for a loss and he had a half quarterback sack, the first of his career. In the strike-shortened 1982 season, Andrews started all nine games, recording 67 tackles, tying with Johnnie Johnson for the team lead. He also had six tackles for losses and recorded three sacks. He recorded a forced fumble and batted away five passes either in pass rushes or pass coverages.\nThe following season, George Andrews had a new coach, John Robinson, and a new defensive scheme. Andrews would be an outside linebacker in a 3-4 defense, similar to the position he had played in college. He responded with 77 tackles and three sacks. His first NFL interception, he returned 22 yards and it led to a Ram offensive score. Nine of his tackles (including sacks) went for losses and Andrews defended 12 passes, the most among Rams' linebackers.\nIn 1984, Andrews was off to a great start, sacking Gary Hogeboom on the third play of the season that forced Hogeboom to cough up the ball and Jack Youngblood recovered it on the Dallas 2-yard line, where 2,000-yard rusher Eric Dickerson ran it over for the first Rams score of the 1984 season. Andrews prowess at sacking quarterbacks in 1984 prompted Bill Bain to call Andrews, \"The White Lawrence Taylor\" \nBut his luck seemed to run out when he injured his knee in Week 10 against the St. Louis Cardinals. Through 10 full weeks Andrews recorded 43 tackles, 13 of them were for losses with six being quarterback sacks, which was second on the team, behind Youngblood. Andrews played one series in Week Eleven of 1984 but was put on injured reserve for the remainder of the season.\nIn 1985, Andrews, who had rehabbed the knee, attempted a comeback but another knee injury in training camp in 1985 ended the comeback. Andrews was attempting a quick maneuver around a New England Patriot blocker in the final exhibition game of 1985. As he moved, untouched by defenders, Andrews planted his right foot and felt his cleats catch in the turf. \"I felt my knee explode,\" he said.\nIn 1986, the Rams offered George Andrews a shot as an inside linebacker, to take some pressure off of him and the speed he lost due to two major knee surgeries in two seasons. George Andrews played inside linebacker at training camp that year but didn't like it.\nOn August 25, 1986, his career ended as the Rams released him.\nAndrews' \"Plan B\" (if he could not return to football) was to finish taking the required test to become a certified financial planner. He had taken four of the six required tests to become a CFP.\nAndrews played six seasons for the Rams, playing 80 games, starting 58. He ended his career with 12½ sacks, 7 fumble recoveries, 1 interception, 23 passes defensed, and 6 forced fumbles to match his 340 tackles. His right outside linebacker job had been held by a fine player, Mike Wilcher, since 1984."

Sportek was originally supposed to be open for the start of the IBL season in 2007, however due to construction delays it did not open until two weeks later, on 10 July 2007. Additionally, due to the delays, many safety features were not complete, such as padding on the fences.\nMany features common in most ballparks also were not present. Bullpens were also never built, forcing pitchers to warm up in foul territory. Dugouts were nothing more than canvas tents and benches. Down the right field line, a home run was only away, considerably shorter than any professional ballpark. Rather than traditional stadium seating, Sportek only offered green plastic chairs. Without lights at Sportek, all IBL games had to be played during day time, in the hot Israeli summer heat.\nIt is located in Tel Aviv in the southern end of Tel Aviv's largest outdoor public park, a 10-minute walk from the seaside Tel Aviv hotels. Sportek is a multipurpose facility, with space for basketball, soccer, wall climbing, skating, jobbing, frisbee, and trampolining."

In 2007, Harris was reportedly found dead in Brazil, after disappearing two weeks earlier.\nBiography.\nHarris attended Garfield High School in Seattle and played for Washington State University. While at Garfield, his team made the state finals, and, while at WSU, the team reached the east regionals of the NCAA tournament.\nAfter working as a counselor in Seattle, he returned to Brazil in 2007 to play for Universo BRB, a basketball team in the capital of Brazil, Brasília. His wife last heard from him on November 4, when he was apparently trying to take a taxi from one city to another. Brazilian media reported that teammates said he was acting strangely and he was said to have been sighted in Bezerra, a city near Brasília, on foot and asking for money. Brazilian wire service EFE reported that he took a taxi to Goiânia, then another taxi to the state of Rio Grande do Norte. Somewhere in Bahia, though, he jumped from the moving vehicle and ran off. Another account had him disappearing while the driver refueled, leaving his luggage in the vehicle.\nDiscovery of body and aftermath.\nAccording to the wire service, he had shown \"mental imbalances\", and claimed that other teammates were harassing him. His wife reported that he had \"feared for his life\" and told her of rumors \"involving himself\", and though he wanted to leave the country, his passport was in custody of team management. She also said that his credit card issuer had reported several unsuccessful attempts to use his card.\nOn November 18, 2007, officials from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation reported that his body had been found in an \"outdoor location\" some 50 miles east of Brasília; later reports specified Formosa in the state of Goiás. He was said to have been found with a shoelace wrapped around his neck, and one report said he was hanging from a tree. Other reports indicated he was in a vacant lot in the city.\nHarris' wife's, stepfather and a friend had traveled to Brazil before the body was found."

        "text": "The Washington State Cougars men's basketball team represents Washington State University and competes in the Pac-12 Conference (Pac-12) of NCAA Division I. The Cougars play their home games on campus in Pullman at Beasley Coliseum, which has a capacity of 12,058. They are currently led by head coach David Riley.\nHistory.\nWashington State began varsity intercollegiate competition in men's basketball in 1902. The Cougars were retroactively awarded the 1917 National Championship by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. The team played to large crowds in the late-1970s when George Raveling was head coach.\nFor the better part of seven decades, the Cougars were a consistent contender in the Pac-10 and its predecessor, the Pacific Coast Conference. After a dark period in the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was the beginning of a resurgence under coach Dick Bennett. The 2004–05 season saw a large increase in student support as the team finished within a few wins of a .500 record (along with a stunning upset win against Arizona, an eventual Elite Eight team). Bennett retired at the end of the 2005–06 season and was replaced by his son, Tony.\nTony Bennett tied the all-time WSU record for wins (26) twice in three seasons as head coach before leaving to coach the Virginia Cavaliers in 2009. Washington State had recently cancelled a trip to the 2009 Final Four for Bennett and his staff, and was considering dropping chartered recruiting trips which had been started one year prior at Bennett's request.\n2006–07.\nThe Cougars earned a #3 seed in the NCAA tournament and beat Oral Roberts 70–54 in the first round. The Cougars then lost to Vanderbilt in the second round 78–74 in double overtime. Their final record was 13–5 in the Pac-10 and 26–8 overall, which tied the school record for most wins in a season. During the 2006–07 season, the Cougars swept rival Washington, Arizona, Arizona State, USC, Oregon State, and California. In the tournament, the coaching staff wore a pin saying TAY, which stood for Turn-Around Year. After the season, Coach Tony Bennett received the Naismith Coach of the Year award, the highest honor for a college basketball coach.\n2007–08.\nIn 2008, the Cougars returned to the NCAA tournament. The Cougars earned a #4 seed and were matched up against #13 seed Winthrop University. The Cougars dominated in the second half after a 29–29 tie in the first half to finish 71–40, far beyond the 9 point margin they were favored by.\nAfter two straight victories in the NCAA Tournament, the Cougars headed to the Sweet Sixteen for the second time in school history. In the Sweet Sixteen, Washington State was matched against the #1 overall seed North Carolina. During the first half, both teams seem evenly matched, but North Carolina took control in the second half and won by a score of 68–47. The Cougars finished the 2007–08 season with a record of 26–9.\nThe Kyle Smith Turnaround.\nOn March 27, 2019, Smith was named as the 19th head coach of Washington State, agreeing to a six-year contract worth $1.4 million annually. He was formally introduced at a press conference on April 1, 2019. In his first season at Washington State, Smith led the Cougars to a 6-12 conference record(16-16 overall), their best since 2011-12. In the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament, Washington State beat Colorado, their first win in the conference tournament in over 10 years. In September 2021, Smith signed a contract extension through the 2026-27 season. [1]\nDuring the 2021-22 season, Smith lead the Cougars to their first winning record in conference play (11-9) in 14 years (2007-08). The Cougars followed up their regular season success with a win in the Pac-12 Tournament before losing to eventual runner-up UCLA. Following that, an NIT berth as a No. 4 seed gave the Cougs their first postseason bout in 11 years. Their first round win against Santa Clara (63-50) notched their first 20-win season since 2010-11. The 2021-22 season ended after an impressive run that landed the Cougs in the Semifinals of the NIT (for the second time in program history) against Texas A&amp;M, where their final record on the season was 22-15.\nOn February 19, 2024, the Cougars returned to the AP Poll for the first time since the 2007–08 season (#21 with a 20-6 record). The following week, Washington State completed a season sweep of the 4th ranked team in the country, Arizona, to move into 1st place in the PAC-12 and all but ensure their first March Madness appearance in 16 years.\nOn March 17, 2024, Washington State was given an at-large bid by the selection committee, officially ending their 16-year long NCAA Tournament drought. The Cougars received a 7-seed and a first-round matchup against the Drake Bulldogs.\nHead coaches.\nGeorge Raveling* was the first African American head coach in the Pacific Athletic Conference (known as the PAC 8 at the time). He coached from 1972–1983 and won 167 games at WSU. \nHead coach Tony Bennett announced that he was leaving for Virginia following the 2008–09 season. Bennett, who became head coach after his father Dick Bennett's retirement, finished the season with a record. In the previous two years, he led the Cougars to consecutive NCAA tournament appearances; father and son coached the Cougars for three seasons each.\nKen Bone replaced Bennett as head coach of the WSU Cougars Men's Basketball Team in February 2009. Bone served as head coach until 2014 and he was followed as head coach by Ernie Kent.\nKent served as head coach until 2019. He was replaced by current head coach Kyle Smith.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Cougars have appeared in seven NCAA Tournaments, with an overall record \nNIT results.\nThe Cougars have appeared in seven National Invitation Tournaments (NIT), with a combined record of 10–7.\nCBI results.\nThe Cougars have appeared in one College Basketball Invitational (CBI). Their combined record is 4–2.\nRetired numbers.\nThe Cougars have retired two jersey numbers in program history, most recently Klay Thompson's number 1 in 2020.\nCougars in the NBA.\nWashington State has had 21 former players who have gone on to play in the NBA.\nRivalries.\nGonzaga.\nGonzaga University is a Jesuit university in Spokane, about north of Pullman. As of the 2013–14 season, Washington State has a lead in the series against the Bulldogs; the series began in 1907 and has most recently been played annually since 2001. The game in December 2007 marked the first time the two met as ranked teams. Visiting Washington State was ranked #6 in the AP Poll and won over #19 Gonzaga at the McCarthey Athletic Center.\nIdaho.\nA non-conference series since 1959, Washington State has played the Idaho Vandals of neighboring Moscow annually since 1906 in a rivalry dubbed the Battle of the Palouse; the U of I is less than east of Pullman. They often met four or five times per season until 1964, reduced to twice a season for the next decade. It has since become an annual event early in the schedule (except for the mid-1990s, when two games per season were played). The continuing rivalry is the oldest in the western United States, four years older than WSU's series with the Washington Huskies.\nThe two played the first-ever regular season basketball game in the newly-enclosed Kibbie Dome in January 1976, won by the Cougars. The rivalry was at its peak in December 1982 when 11,000 were in the same venue for a Saturday night overtime thriller, won by \nWashington State has a lead in the series through November 2021, when Washington State won in Moscow, for a fourth straight win.\nWashington.\nThe University of Washington is located in Seattle, nearly west of Pullman. As of 2023, the Washington Huskies have a lead in the series that began in 1910. Recently, Washington State has dominated, winning 7 of the last 9 meetings. \nRecord vs. Pac-12 opponents.\nThe Washington State Cougars have the following all-time series records vs. Pac-12 opponents."

        "text": "Robert \"Bob\" Thornton (born 17 July 1967) is a Scottish professional darts player, who is a two-time World Seniors champion.\nThornton is a three-time major winner between the BDO and PDC, having won the World Masters in 2007, UK Open in 2012, and World Grand Prix in 2015. He is also a former finalist at the Players Championship Finals in 2009 and Grand Slam of Darts in 2013. In addition, Thornton has reached three World Championship quarter-finals across both organisations and was a participant in the Premier League in 2013, 2014 and 2016.\nBDO career.\nThornton returned to playing darts in 2002, having given up the game for two decades to raise his children. He qualified for the BDO World Championship for the first time in 2005. He beat Martin Atkins and Tony West before losing to Darryl Fitton in the quarter-finals. He then failed to qualify for the 2006 and 2007 events.\nThornton's first professional title came in the Central Scotland Open in April 2007, beating Mike Veitch in the final. He also won the Scottish Masters by defeating Ross Montgomery. He failed to make it through the qualifying event for the 2008 World Championship, but did make it to the televised stages of the 2007 Winmau World Masters in the same weekend. Thornton then beat Co Stompé, BDO world champion Martin Adams, and Atkins to reach the final. He managed to avenge his defeat by Fitton at the 2005 Lakeside World Championship to claim his first major title by 7 sets to 5 and win the £25,000 first prize and also a place in the 2008 World Championship.\nHis appearance at the World Championship was only his second visit to Lakeside and he matched his previous appearance by reaching the quarter-finals. Having beaten John Walton and Tony O'Shea, he lost to defending champion Adams. Thornton's good form continued into 2008 when he won the Dutch Open in February and reached the last eight of the Scottish Open a week later to achieve a career high of third in the WDF world rankings and was top of the BDO rankings.\nPDC career.\nThornton qualified for the 2008 UK Open via the Pub qualifiers and then went on to switch to the PDC after withdrawing from the Scottish team for the Europe Cup, stating that his first goal was to get into the top 16 of the PDC Order of Merit which would guarantee his place in all the major tournaments. At the UK Open he lost 9–6 to Alan Tabern in the last 32. Thornton qualified for the Las Vegas Desert Classic losing again in the last 32 this time 6–5 against Adrian Lewis, but went one better at the World Grand Prix when he beat Peter Manley 2–1 in sets in the first round before being defeated 3–2 by Andy Hamilton in the last 16. His good start to his career in the PDC continued at the European Championship where he saw off John Part, Mensur Suljović and Ronnie Baxter to advance to the semi-finals for the first time and a meeting with Phil Taylor. Thornton averaged 102.12 in the match but Taylor averaged 113.33 as he won 11–7. Thornton's World Masters title from last year saw him qualify for the Grand Slam of Darts and he advanced from Group E with wins over Gary Mawson and Kirk Shepherd, before being edged out 10–8 by Terry Jenkins in the last 16. Away from the television cameras on the PDC Pro Tour he won the Australian Open Players Championship with a 3–1 success against Paul Nicholson. He was a losing semi-finalist three times and a quarter-finalist four times in the other events to finish as the highest non-qualified player on the Pro Tour Order of Merit for the 2009 PDC World Championship.\nAt the World Championship, he won 3–1 against Wayne Jones, but went out in the second round with a 4–3 defeat to world number eight Wayne Mardle. However, this performance guaranteed Thornton a spot in the top 32 of the PDC Order of Merit – just eight months after his defection from the BDO. He reached his first PDC final at the Players Championship Finals. Seeded 14 in the tournament based on the previous year's floor events, Thornton edged Mark Dudbridge in the first round on a final-leg decider. This gave him a second round tie with world number 10 and third seed Alan Tabern, in which Thornton dominated 6–2 after Tabern had missed a dart for a 3–1 lead. He then played a resurgent Dennis Priestley – who had earlier been on the brink of defeat, losing 5–0 to John Part before rattling off six consecutive legs to win the match – in the quarter-finals. Those heroics seemed to fatigue Priestley as he slumped to a 9–5 defeat to Thornton, which earned him a semi-final place against world number two James Wade. In a very tight semi-final, Thornton won four of the last five legs to earn a 13–10 victory and a spot in the final against Phil Taylor, who had only dropped eight legs in the tournament to that point. With the scores level at 5–5 early on, Taylor came out on top 16–9, however Thornton earned £25,000 for making the final, propelling him up the rankings. Thornton became only the third player to win both events of a PDC Pro Tour weekend in Irvine, North Ayrshire, when he beat Dennis Priestley to win both the Scottish Players Championship and the Scottish Regional qualifier for the UK Open. He made his Premier League debut in Aberdeen in an exhibition match against James Wade. Thornton lost 7–2. By this time, Thornton had reached number 19 in the PDC Order of Merit. He lost 9–2 to Adrian Lewis in the third round of the UK Open and 10–4 to Taylor in the first round of the World Matchplay. Thornton saw off Wes Newton 6–4 in the opening round of the European Championship, but lost to Taylor once more as he was whitewashed 9–0, with Thornton's average of 83.24 being almost 30 points lower than his opponents. Thornton topped Group H at the Grand Slam of Darts and then edged past Darin Young in the last 16 10–9, but was knocked out 16–9 in the quarter-finals by Terry Jenkins.\nThornton defeated two qualifiers in Christian Perez and Jyhan Artut at the 2010 World Championship, before Taylor was once again the victor when the two met in the last 16 this time winning by four sets to one.\nThornton was a fixture in the world's top 16 but then broke his hand and later his 2011 season was curtailed significantly after being rushed to hospital complaining of chest pains, breathing problems and headaches. He was diagnosed with pneumonia and did not play again until the 2012 World Championship, where he lost in the second round to Adrian Lewis.\nFirst PDC major.\nIn June 2012, Thornton won his second major title and first in the PDC, the 2012 UK Open. He came through an extremely tough draw, which included defeats over former world champions, Mark Webster and Dennis Priestley, and world numbers 4 and 5, Gary Anderson and Wes Newton. In the semi-finals he faced rising star Dave Chisnall and with the scores level at 2–2 early on, Thornton produced a devastating run and took the match 10–4 to reach his second major PDC final, where he played fifteen time world champion Phil Taylor. Thornton trailed 0–2 in the final but then won nine of the next ten legs, as his opponent missed 23 darts at a double, and went on to seal an 11–5 victory with a 121 finish. He moved 11 places in the rankings from number 34 to 23 thanks to the win, with the £40,000 prize he won being the highest of his career. In the next major event, the World Matchplay, Thornton was whitewashed 0–10 by Adrian Lewis in the first round. In October, Thornton reached the final of the 13th Players Championship, but lost to Michael van Gerwen 5–6, after leading 4–1. He atoned for this just one day later as he won the 14th event, defeating Gary Anderson 6–5 in an all Scottish final. The next day, Thornton came from behind to beat Mark Walsh 2–1 in sets in the first round of the World Grand Prix. He was then involved in one of the best games in the tournament's history as he again overcame Taylor, this time by 3 sets to 2, hitting eight maximums and taking out 101 and 104 checkouts and surviving six match darts from Taylor. He played Mervyn King in the quarter-finals and lost 0–3 in 31 minutes, winning just four legs during the match. He continued his good form in the Players Championships at the 15th event by reaching another final, this time losing to Peter Wright 1–6. Thornton finished second in Group B of the Grand Slam of Darts to qualify for the last 16, but then lost 8–10 to former champion Scott Waites. After all 33 ProTour events of 2012 had been played, Thornton finished 10th on the Order of Merit to qualify for the Players Championship Finals where compatriot Gary Anderson beat him 10–6 in the second round.\n2013 season.\nAt the 2013 World Championship Thornton missed four darts to win 4–2 in the second round against Paul Nicholson and another one in the deciding set. Nicholson threw for the match and left 58 after 12 darts, only for Thornton to take out 130. Thornton won the bull to throw first in the sudden-death leg and won it to set up a last 16 meeting with Phil Taylor. However, Thornton could only win three legs as he bowed out of the tournament with a 4–0 defeat. Thornton partnered Gary Anderson for the third time at the World Cup of Darts and they were shocked by Spain 5–4 in the last 16.\nThornton qualified for the Premier League for the first time thanks to his UK Open win last year. He produced some very impressive performances in the first half of the campaign such as in week four when he scored his highest ever televised average of 109.33 during a 7–2 win over Anderson. He also averaged 107.65 in beating Simon Whitlock 7–1 in week eight, and after the ninth week he was in the top four who would qualify for the play-offs at the end of the season. Thornton suffered somewhat of a dip in form after this as he could only win two of his next five games and went into the last week needing to beat the Dutch duo of Raymond van Barneveld and Michael van Gerwen to progress to the play-offs. He lost to van Barneveld 7–4 and, after other results had gone against him, needed an unlikely 7–0 victory over van Gerwen, but instead was beaten 7–1 to end the season in fifth place.\nHe threw a nine-dart finish in a quarter-final match at the first UK Open Qualifier of the year against Dave Chisnall, but went on to lose 6–4. He won the fourth event in March by beating Jamie Caven 6–4 in the final, having ended Michael van Gerwen's 29 game unbeaten Pro Tour streak start to the year in the semi-finals. Thornton reached the final of the first Players Championship by beating Dean Winstanley in the quarter-finals and Gary Anderson in the semis. He saved his best performance for the final where he beat Ronny Huybrechts 6–0 with an average of 111. In the defence of his UK Open title, Thornton saw off Matthew Edgar and Kirk Shepherd to set up a last 16 meeting with Raymond van Barneveld. Thornton began the match brightly to lead 4–1, but went on to lose 9–7. Thornton produced his first ever victory over van Barneveld in the second round of the European Championship, beating him 10–9, but was defeated in the quarter-finals again in a last leg decider by Ronny Huybrechts. He then suffered his fourth successive first round defeat at the World Matchplay as Ian White beat him 10–3 and also lost in the opening round of the World Grand Prix 2–1 in sets to Paul Nicholson. Thornton bounced back to claim the 11th Players Championship just over a week later with a 6–5 triumph over Jamie Caven. Thornton won two of his three games at the Grand Slam of Darts to finish top of his group on leg difference. He edged past Mervyn King 10–8 in the next round with a 161 checkout in the final leg and then punished 31 missed darts at doubles from Tony O'Shea in a 16–6 win to reach the semi-finals of the event for the first time where he met reigning BDO world champion Scott Waites. Thornton took an early command of the match with a 5–1 lead and withstood a fightback from Waites, who closed the gap to 8–7, to win 16–9. He could never recover from a poor start in the final as he lost each of the first five legs against Phil Taylor and went on to lose 16–6. His form continued into the next week as he reached the final of the 15th Players Championship, losing 6–3 to Dave Chisnall.\n2014 season.\nThornton advanced to the third round of the 2014 World Championship with comfortable victories over Max Hopp and Beau Anderson, but didn't produce his best darts against Wes Newton as he was beaten 4–1. His first final of the year came in February at the fifth UK Open Qualifier where he was defeated 6–2 by Gary Anderson. Thornton was a surprise 9–7 loser to Mensur Suljović in the UK Open fourth round. Thornton beat Phil Taylor 6–4 to play Ian White in the final of the sixth Players Championship. He fell 4–2 and 5–4 down and survived six match darts from White in the next leg to win his eighth PDC title 6–5. He won the next event too by defeating emerging player Keegan Brown 6–5, with his opponent this time missing four match darts. 24 hours later Thornton claimed the eighth event by averaging 106.56 in defeating Terry Jenkins 6–4. He only won two of his 16 Premier League matches to finish eighth in the table. Thornton played in his third World Cup of Darts this year and first with Peter Wright and they progressed to the quarter-finals where they played Northern Ireland's Brendan Dolan and Michael Mansell. Wright lost his singles match to Dolan, but Thornton saw off Mansell 4–3 to send the tie into a deciding doubles game which Scotland lost 4–1. He reached the final of the 11th Players Championship but lost 6–2 to Anderson.\nThornton attended the funeral of his mother in October and on the same day flew to Dublin to compete in the second round of the World Grand Prix against James Wade. The match is considered the best in the tournament's history. At 1–0 ahead in sets, Wade opened the next with the second ever double-start nine-dart finish and threw a 156 finish in the leg after. However, Thornton fought back to win the set and the following one, before incredibly throwing the game's second nine-darter to become the first players to have thrown a perfect leg in the same match in darts history. Thornton would miss four darts to win 3–1, with the tie instead going into a deciding set which Wade took to eliminate Thornton. He was knocked out in the second round of the European Championship by Terry Jenkins and lost all three of his matches at the Grand Slam to finish bottom of his group. Darren Webster missed two match darts in the first round of the Players Championship Finals to allow Thornton to triumph 6–5 and he then fought back from 9–4 down against Jamie Caven to send the game into a deciding leg in which Thornton hit a single one when requiring double top to complete a 120 finish and was beaten 10–9.\n2015 season.\nThornton was the only player to reach the quarter-finals of the 2015 World Championship without dropping a set. In his first appearance in the last eight of the event trailed Michael van Gerwen 3–0 in sets, before winning two unanswered sets. Thornton missed one dart to level the game at 3–3 and was ultimately defeated 5–3. His average of 101.49 was the first time he has been over the 100 mark in a World Championship match.\nAt the second Players Championship, Thorton wired double twelve for a nine darter in a quarter-final defeat to compatriot Peter Wright. He reached the final of the third event, but lost 6–3 to Adrian Lewis. At the European Darts Open, Thornton averaged 111.77 whilst beating James Wade 6–1 in the semi-finals and claimed the first European Tour title of his career by seeing off Kim Huybrechts 6–2 with an average of 106.18 in the final.\nAt the World Grand Prix, Thornton did not drop a set in the first two rounds in wins over Daryl Gurney and Justin Pipe. Thornton then beat Ian White and Mensur Suljović en route to the final. He faced Michael van Gerwen, who hit eighteen 180's, but Thornton beat him 5–4 in sets to win his second PDC major title and third overall. Thornton also rose to number five in the PDC Order of Merit and secured his entry into the Grand Slam of Darts, where he lost 16–7 in the quarter-finals to Phil Taylor.\n2016 season.\nThornton was eliminated at the first round stage of a World Championship for the first time in his career in 2016, when he could only take three legs off Alan Norris in a 3–0 defeat. He relinquished an 8–0 lead in the first round of the Masters to lose 10–9 against Dave Chisnall. On the opening night of the Premier League, Thornton averaged just 75.68 as Chisnall whitewashed him 7–0. He only won two matches out of 16 games to finish eighth in the table. Thornton was knocked out in the second round of the UK Open 6–4 by Arron Monk. Thornton suffered another heavy loss to Chisnall, this time 11–2 in the second round of the World Matchplay and he was beaten 2–1 in sets by Stephen Bunting in the opening round of the World Grand Prix. He lost in the first round of the European Championship 6–4 to Cristo Reyes and was involved in a nine dart shoot-out at the Grand Slam after Thornton and Dimitri Van den Bergh had both won two of their three games and were locked with a plus one leg difference. Thornton won by 345 points to 340 and then was defeated 10–5 by Michael van Gerwen in the second round. After losing 6–3 to Adrian Lewis in the first round of the Players Championship Finals, it meant Thornton had not progressed past the second round of any major event in 2016.\n2017 season.\nIn the second round of the 2017 World Championship, Thornton lost the first six legs against Daryl Gurney but recovered to move 3–2 up. He then lost six of the final seven legs to be edged out 4–3. He played in his first final since the 2015 World Grand Prix at the ninth Players Championship and was defeated 6–2 by Michael van Gerwen."

        "title": "2008 Italian Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2008 Italian Grand Prix (formally the Formula 1 Gran Premio Santander D'Italia 2008) was a Formula One motor race held on 14 September 2008 at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza, Monza, Italy. It was the 14th race of the 2008 Formula One World Championship. Future four-time World Champion Sebastian Vettel for the Toro Rosso team took a maiden victory, winning the 53-lap race from a maiden pole position. Heikki Kovalainen finished second in a McLaren, and Robert Kubica third in a BMW Sauber.\nVettel began the race, started under the safety car, ahead of Kovalainen in second. Red Bull's Mark Webber started from third. Rain early in the race allowed Vettel to establish a solid lead over Kovalainen, which he extended as the track dried. Kubica and Fernando Alonso finished in the top four after starting from 11th and eighth, respectively. McLaren driver and Drivers' Championship leader Lewis Hamilton was able to move through the field after qualifying in 15th, finishing in seventh, one place behind rival Felipe Massa, of Ferrari.\nVettel's victory made him the youngest driver to win a Formula One race, at 21 years 73 days in addition to giving Toro Rosso (which was formerly Minardi team) its maiden Formula One win despite using a 2007-spec engine, and also became the first German driver to win a race since Michael Schumacher at the 2006 Chinese Grand Prix. Vettel's record was broken by Max Verstappen aged 18 years and 228 days at the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix. Massa scored one point more than Hamilton, narrowing the McLaren driver's lead in the Championship once more with four races remaining. However, Kovalainen's second-placed finish put McLaren closer to catching Ferrari in the Constructors' Championship.\nThis race marked Toro Rosso's first and only podium until the 2019 German Grand Prix as well as first and only victory until the 2020 Italian Grand Prix when Pierre Gasly won in the pseudo-successor Scuderia AlphaTauri team. This was also Kovalainen's last podium in Formula One.\nBackground.\nHeading into the 14th race of the season, McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton led the Drivers' Championship with 76 points; Ferrari driver Felipe Massa was second on 74 points, two points behind Hamilton. Behind Hamilton and Massa in the Drivers' Championship, Robert Kubica was third on 58 points in a BMW Sauber, and Massa's Ferrari teammate Kimi Räikkönen fourth on 57 points. Kubica's teammate Nick Heidfeld was fifth on 49 points. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari were leading on 131 points and McLaren were second on 119 points, 12 points behind. BMW Sauber were third with 107 points. In the battle for fourth-place Toyota had 41 points, ahead of Renault with 36 points.\nAfter the previous race, Hamilton was penalised for cutting a chicane and gaining an advantage over Räikkönen in the closing laps. This meant that Hamilton was demoted from first to third position, giving victory to Massa. While McLaren had lodged an appeal against the decision, the result would not be heard until September 23. Reflecting on the controversy, Norbert Haug, Vice President of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport, said:\nFollowing the rain-soaked Belgian Grand Prix, Massa expressed his hope that the Italian Grand Prix would be held on a dry track, saying \"it would be nice not to have the rain here and not have any opportunity to have a consistent race.\" The close nature of the Championship meant that Ferrari's home race had the potential to be a turning point in the season. Testing at the Monza circuit in early September had indicated that the performance gap between McLaren and Ferrari had narrowed. Despite this, Ferrari were hoping that their straight-line speed would be better suited to Monza's long straights. Ferrari confirmed on September 12 that Räikkönen would continue to drive for the team until at least 2010, ending media speculation that he could be about to retire.\nPractice.\nThree practice sessions were held before the race: the first was held on Friday morning and the second on Friday afternoon. Both sessions lasted 90 minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. All three sessions were affected by rain, with only the second giving teams any chance to run dry-weather tyres. Adrian Sutil was quickest with a time of 1:32.842 in the first session, more than half a second quicker than the next fastest drivers Rubens Barrichello and Giancarlo Fisichella. Timo Glock was the next quickest, almost four seconds behind Sutil. Conditions were so poor that six drivers, including both McLarens, failed to set times. The session was stopped four minutes early, though by that time no cars had entered the track for at least ten minutes. The track dried out in the second session; Räikkönen adapted best to the changed conditions with a lap of 1:23.861, significantly quicker than his morning time. Kubica was the next fastest, with his BMW teammate Heidfeld in third. Hamilton, Nico Rosberg and Massa rounded out the top six. Glock was fastest in the final session with a time of 1:35.464, followed by Sebastian Vettel, Rosberg, Jarno Trulli, Kazuki Nakajima and Heidfeld. Hamilton only completed eight laps, and finished last with a time almost 11 seconds behind Glock.\nQualifying.\nThe qualifying session on Saturday afternoon was split into three parts. The first part ran for 20 minutes and eliminated the cars from qualifying that finished the session 16th or lower. The second part of qualifying lasted 15 minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions 11 to 15. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth, and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying were not allowed to refuel before the race, and as such carried more fuel than in the previous sessions.\nVettel became the youngest driver in the history of Formula One to take pole position, with a time of 1:37.555 in very wet conditions. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Kovalainen. Mark Webber qualified third after his final lap pushed Sébastien Bourdais into fourth position. Massa took sixth position behind Rosberg. Trulli, Fernando Alonso, Glock and Heidfeld rounded out the top ten. Kubica qualified 11th, blaming late rain in the second qualifying session for his position. Fisichella qualified 12th to give Force India its best grid position of the season. Both Räikkönen and Hamilton blamed a late entry into the second session for their poor qualifying times, which saw them eliminated in 14th and 15th positions, respectively. Hamilton originally ran on the standard wet-weather tyres, and by the time he had changed to extreme wet-weather tyres the rain had intensified. This was McLaren's only result outside the top ten in qualifying all season and the first time in Hamilton's career that he had failed to progress into the final qualifying session.\nRace.\nHeavy rain prior to the race made the track very slippery, with more rain expected throughout the day. The air temperature at the track was . Jenson Button and Kazuki Nakajima started the race from the pit-lane, their teams choosing to make adjustments from qualifying to the set-ups of their cars. All cars were using extreme wet-weather tyres. The race began at 14:00 local time (UTC+1) behind the safety car because of the rain, meaning that there would be a rolling start. Bourdais' car stalled on the grid, and was pushed back to the pits. By the time his team restarted the car, he was in last position and one lap down.\nThe safety car pulled into the pit-lane at the end of the second lap. Vettel retained his lead into the first corner, followed by Kovalainen, Webber, Rosberg and Massa. Kubica passed Heidfeld at the first chicane; Glock passed Alonso later in the lap. Vettel immediately opened a lead of two seconds over Kovalainen; the McLaren driver experienced visibility problems as a result of the spray off the back of the Toro Rosso. Alonso regained seventh from Glock when he passed him at the first chicane on lap four as the track began to dry. Räikkönen and Hamilton passed Coulthard on the same lap to take 12th and 13th positions, respectively. The next lap, Hamilton attempted to pass Räikkönen at the third corner, but overshot, cutting the chicane. Emerging ahead of the Ferrari, he gave the place back, returning the advantage and avoiding a penalty. Glock spun on lap seven, losing one place to Kubica.\nVettel continued to open his lead on Kovalainen; by lap eight it stood at 6.3 seconds. Both Räikkönen and Hamilton passed Fisichella in separate manoeuvres over the next two laps. Hamilton took 11th position from Räikkönen on lap 11, outbraking the Ferrari at turn four. Fisichella collided with Coulthard two laps later. As a result of the contact, the Force India's front wing broke loose and lodged under the car. Consequently, Fisichella lost control at turn nine, spinning into the gravel trap and retiring. Massa overtook Rosberg for fourth on the same lap, beginning a close fight where both drivers repeatedly exchanged positions over the next three laps. Massa eventually consolidated fourth position on lap 15. Hamilton passed Heidfeld, Glock, Kubica and Alonso in separate manoeuvres, to sit in seventh by lap 19.\nVettel pitted from first position on lap 18. Kovalainen, Webber and Massa pitted four laps later. Light rain began to fall on lap 26, though only lasted five minutes. Glock, Trulli, Räikkönen and Hamilton completed their first pit stops over the following laps. Coulthard was the first driver to try intermediate wet-weather tyres when he pitted on lap 28. He lost grip in the wet and went straight through the first chicane. Alonso, Heidfeld, Kubica and Piquet took their only pit stops for the race soon after, all changing to intermediate tyres. By lap 36 the majority of the field were running on intermediate tyres. Webber was passed at turn eight by Massa on lap 35. The Australian spun after the corner, though managed to retain seventh position. A lap later, however, Hamilton outbraked Webber at turn three and demoted the Red Bull driver to eighth.\nHamilton began lapping fastest, recording a 1:32.869 on lap 38, more than a second faster than first-placed Vettel. Lap 45 saw three drivers set consecutive new fastest laps; Kubica's 1:32.366 was beaten by Webber with a 1:32.014s. They were then superseded by Räikkönen, who set a 1:31.691. On lap 49 Webber attempted to pass Hamilton at the first chicane, but the two cars touched wheels. Webber was forced down the escape road, and when he emerged in front of Hamilton, he returned the position. Räikkönen continued to move through the field; he passed Coulthard and Piquet in separate manoeuvres to take ninth position. Nakajima attempted to pass Coulthard into turn nine, but succeeded only in turning into the Red Bull RB4, sending it into the gravel trap. Coulthard pitted for a new front wing, which dropped him to 17th. Vettel crossed the finish line on lap 53 by 12.5 seconds over Kovalainen, becoming the youngest driver in Formula One history to win a Grand Prix. The one-stop strategies used by Kubica and Alonso paid off as they finished in third and fourth, respectively. Heidfeld, Massa, Hamilton and Webber rounded out the top eight. Räikkönen finished in ninth position, setting the fastest laptime of 1:28.047 on the final lap.\nPost-race.\nThe top three finishers appeared on the podium and in the subsequent press conference. Vettel acknowledged the support of his team, saying the set-up of the car perfectly suited the way the race developed. Other drivers congratulated Vettel; Hamilton said that \"with all that pressure it is easier to make mistakes, and he obviously didn't, so congratulations to him. He did a good job.\" The Grand Prix also marked the first win by Toro Rosso, the first non-Ferrari Italian-based team to win since 1957. Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicali paid tribute to the team, who use Ferrari engines, saying \"They deserve it, they are close to us, and we are happy to work with them because we are giving them our engine.\"\nKovalainen expressed his disappointment in finishing second, saying:\nHamilton was satisfied with his performance in the race, saying \"today was all about damage control: I came away with some points and kept my lead in the world Drivers' Championship.\" Massa said that he had hoped to do better, but added \"I've managed to make up a point on my nearest rival so this is absolutely not a negative result.\" Massa took three points from the race, compared to Hamilton's two, and narrowed the gap in the Drivers' Championship to one point with four races remaining. Kovalainen's second-placed finish closed the gap in the Constructors' Championship between Ferrari and McLaren from twelve to five points.\nThird-placed Kubica said that his strategy allowed him to capitalise on the changing track conditions, as his only stop seemed the best time to change to intermediate tyres. The Polish driver said that racing in Italy was particularly special for him, having lived in the country for five years: \"That is why we divided the helmet into two pieces. One was Italian colours, one was Polish colours.\" Alonso, who used a similar strategy, said \"the result today is very good because Monza was supposed to be the race that we were looking forward to the least.\" Toyota's failure to score at the race meant that they were tied with Renault on 41 points."

        "title": "2008 Japanese Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2008 Japanese Grand Prix (officially the 2008 Formula 1 Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 12 October 2008, at the Fuji Speedway, Oyama, Japan. It was the 16th race of the 2008 Formula One World Championship. Fernando Alonso for the Renault team won the 67-lap race from fourth position on the starting grid. Robert Kubica finished second for BMW Sauber, and Kimi Räikkönen third for Ferrari.\nLewis Hamilton, the eventual Drivers' Champion, led the Championship going into the race, and started from pole position alongside Räikkönen. Hamilton's McLaren teammate Heikki Kovalainen began from third, next to Alonso. At the first corner Hamilton braked late, forcing Räikkönen wide. Hamilton was later given a penalty, and was criticised by the British racing press for overaggressive driving. Ferrari driver Felipe Massa, Hamilton's principal Championship rival, was penalised after an incident on lap two in which he touched Hamilton's car, causing it to spin. The incident dropped Hamilton to the back of the field, from where he was unable to regain a points scoring position. Massa later collided with Sébastien Bourdais of Toro Rosso. Bourdais was penalised after the race, and demoted from sixth to tenth position. The penalty prompted widespread criticism from the racing media and ex-drivers.\nThe victory was Alonso's second consecutive win; he started from 15th on the grid to win the two weeks prior. Kubica held off a determined attack from Räikkönen in the closing laps to take second place. Massa's seventh place narrowed his gap to Hamilton in the Drivers' Championship to five points. Ferrari established a seven-point lead over the McLaren team in the Constructors' Championship, with two races of the season remaining.\nBackground.\nThe 2008 Japanese Grand Prix was the 16th round in the 2008 Formula One World Championship and took place on 12 October 2008, at the Fuji Speedway, in Oyama, Japan. The Grand Prix was contested by 20 drivers, in ten teams of two. The teams, also known as \"constructors\", were Ferrari, McLaren-Mercedes, Renault, Honda, Force India, BMW Sauber, Toyota, Red Bull Racing, Williams and Toro Rosso.\nPrior to the race, McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton led the Drivers' Championship with 84 points, and Ferrari driver Felipe Massa was second with 77 points. Behind them in the Drivers' Championship, Robert Kubica was third with 64 points in a BMW Sauber, and Massa's Ferrari teammate Kimi Räikkönen was fourth with 57 points. Kubica's teammate Nick Heidfeld was fifth with 56 points. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren–Mercedes were leading with 135 points, one point ahead of their rivals Ferrari, whom they had overtaken at the previous race. BMW Sauber were third with 120 points. In the battle for fourth place, Renault had 51 points, five points ahead of Toyota.\nA botched pit stop at the had demoted Massa from first position to the back of field. Ferrari decided to give up pitstop light system and revert to the commonly used lollipop man. With three races remaining in the Championship and a seven-point deficit, Massa remained confident about his title chances: \"If you look at what happened to me in Singapore where my gap went from one point to seven so suddenly, then you have to consider it could easily go the other way as well.\" Hamilton emphasised the value that a conservative racing strategy could hold for his title chances:\nFernando Alonso's victory at the Singapore Grand Prix was his first Formula One win since rejoining the Renault team, after driving for McLaren in 2007. After qualifying in 15th and making an early pit stop, Alonso had managed to jump to the front of the race when his teammate Nelson Piquet Jr. crashed. Left with no opportunity to pit, the frontrunners had to delay their stops until the damage was cleared, allowing the heavily fuelled Alonso to move to the front once they did so. Though Alonso questioned whether his Renault team could match the pace of Ferrari and McLaren at Fuji, he said \"We must remain focussed and try to repeat our level of performance from Singapore to fight at the front.\" Renault's technical director Bob Bell said that the team's improvement from the start of the season was encouraging, but \"we recognise that we're not going to overhaul McLaren and Ferrari this season\". Bell said that the objective for the last races was to win more Grands Prix and, importantly, secure fourth position in the Constructors' Championship from Toyota.\nThe Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the sport's governing body, launched the Formula One component of their Make Cars Green campaign at the Japanese Grand Prix. For the weekend, the grooves in the tyres were painted green to promote environmentally friendly driving. FIA president Max Mosley said \"The FIA is determined to ensure that future investment in motor sport will also help drive the development of technologies that will benefit the public at large.\" As is normal for a Formula One race, Bridgestone brought two different tyre compounds to the race; the softer of the two marked by a single white stripe down one of the grooves.\nPractice.\nThree practice sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, and a third on Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted 90 minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. The Friday sessions were held in dry and sunny conditions. Hamilton was quickest in the first session, with a time of 1:18.910 that was less than two-tenths of a second faster than Massa. McLaren driver Heikki Kovalainen was just off Massa's pace; Räikkönen, Alonso and Piquet rounded out the top six, still within a second of Hamilton's time. In the second practice session, Timo Glock, of Toyota, was fastest with a time of 1:18.383, ahead of Alonso, Hamilton, Massa, Räikkönen and Red Bull driver Mark Webber. The top seventeen drivers set times within a second of Glock's fastest lap, indicating a competitive field. Honda tried the new traffic light system, to inform the driver when to pull away from their pitstop, for the first time. The Saturday morning session was held on a damp track, where grip was poor and many drivers were forced to use the run-off areas after sliding off the track. Kubica was quickest with his final lap of the session at 1:25.087; Glock, Piquet, Nick Heidfeld of BMW, Kazuki Nakajima of Williams, Red Bull driver David Coulthard, and Massa rounded out the top seven positions. Hamilton managed only eleventh, but was ahead of Kovalainen and Räikkönen, in 16th and 17th positions, respectively. Both Adrian Sutil and Giancarlo Fisichella of Force India spent most of the session in their garage, suffering numerous mechanical problems.\nQualifying.\nThe qualifying session on Saturday afternoon was split into three parts. The first part ran for 20 minutes, and cars that finished the session 16th or lower were eliminated from qualifying. The second part of qualifying lasted 15 minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions 11 to 15. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth, and decided pole position. Cars which failed to make the final session could refuel before the race, so ran lighter in those sessions. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying were not allowed to refuel before the race, and as such carried more fuel than in the previous sessions.\nHamilton clinched his sixth pole position of the season with a lap time of 1:18.404. He was joined on the front row by Räikkönen, who was fastest for most of the final session. Provisionally sitting in third as the session drew to a close, Massa was pushed back to fifth as Kovalainen and Alonso put in last-minute laps to fill the second row of the grid. Kubica took sixth place, ahead of both Toyota cars of Jarno Trulli and Glock and the Toro Rossos of Sebastian Vettel and Sébastien Bourdais. Coulthard bettered teammate Webber when he qualified 11th; Piquet split the Red Bull drivers in 12th. The only Japanese driver in the field, Nakajima, managed 14th ahead of his Williams teammate Nico Rosberg. Heidfeld could only achieve 16th place, ten places behind his BMW teammate Kubica. Heidfeld spent the majority of the first session struggling with the set-up of his car. The Honda cars of Rubens Barrichello and Jenson Button filled the ninth row in front of the constructor's home crowd. The Force Indias qualified last; Sutil comfortably outqualified his teammate Fisichella by 0.8 seconds, to sit in 19th place.\nRace.\nThe conditions on the grid were dry before the race. The air temperature was and the track temperature was ; conditions were expected to remain consistent throughout the race. Most of the frontrunners began the race on the harder compound tyre; only Massa was using the softer option. The attendance on the day of the Grand Prix was 105,000 people. Räikkönen accelerated faster than Hamilton off the line, getting ahead of him down the first straight, but the McLaren driver pulled into the Ferrari's slipstream, before swerving to overtake Räikkönen in the inside of the corner. Going into the first corner, Hamilton badly locked-up his front wheels while braking and ran wide; although there was no contact, Räikkönen was also forced wide in avoidance. This was then followed by contact with Kovalainen, which finally forced Räikkönen off the track. All three drivers dropped back down the field as a result of the incident. Kubica took the lead ahead of Alonso and Kovalainen after the corner, avoiding collisions as other cars locked their tyres on the cold track. Fisichella drove into the back of Barrichello, scattering carbon fibre over the track. Coulthard collided with Bourdais and then Piquet, sustaining suspension damage and sliding into the barriers after turn two. Nakajima left the track trying to avoid Coulthard, although he managed to rejoin after losing his front wing. The Japanese driver made a pit stop at the end of the lap for a new wing.\nAt the end of the first lap, Kubica led from Alonso, Kovalainen, Trulli, Massa, Hamilton and Räikkönen. On lap two, Massa braked late into the chicane at turn 10, briefly letting Hamilton past, before running over the kerbs on the exit from the corner and hitting the McLaren driver's car. Hamilton was spun round by the contact and made a pit stop at the end of the lap for new tyres and more fuel, which dropped him to 18th place. Massa continued in seventh place. On lap eight Räikkönen passed Trulli into turn 10 to take fourth position. In third place, more than a second ahead of the Ferrari driver, Kovalainen set a new fastest lap of 1:19.258 on lap 12 to which Räikkönen responded with a 1:19.193 four laps later. Two more drivers joined Coulthard in retirement before the first round of fuel stops: Glock made a pit stop on lap five and again on lap six, before retiring because of handling difficulties resulting from a broken seat fixing; Sutil retired on lap nine with a puncture caused by running over carbon fibre shards.\nOn lap 17, Massa and Hamilton were given drive-through penalties, Massa for colliding with Hamilton and Hamilton for forcing Räikkönen off the track into turn one. Hamilton took his penalty immediately. Massa made a pit stop for fuel and tyres on the next lap, before coming into the pit lane again on lap 20 to serve his penalty, which dropped him to 14th place, one place ahead of Hamilton. Meanwhile, Kubica and Räikkönen made pit stops on lap 17 for tyres and fuel. On the same lap, Kovalainen pulled over to the side of the track with engine problems and retired from the race. Alonso made a pit stop on lap 18, emerging ahead of Kubica to take the provisional lead, with cars in front still to pit. Trulli, Vettel and Bourdais made pit stops over the following six laps. Fisichella retired from the race with gearbox problems on lap 21. Piquet took his first pit stop on lap 28, emerging ahead of Bourdais as Alonso opened the gap on Kubica to 7.8 seconds. Massa overtook Button to take 12th position one lap later.\nAlonso lapped consistently in the low 1:19 range, setting the new fastest lap of the race on lap 41, a 1:19.101, to extend his lead over Kubica to more than 12 seconds. Räikkönen was five seconds behind Kubica in third. Alonso made a pit stop for the second time on lap 43 and changed to the softer compound tyre. Kubica, complaining of understeer over the team radio, made his second stop on lap 46, two laps ahead of Räikkönen. Trulli, Bourdais, Vettel and Piquet made pit stops over the next five laps, their teams giving them sufficient fuel to finish the race. As Bourdais exited the pit-lane in seventh place on lap 51, Massa, who was eighth, but yet to make his final pit stop, attempted to pass him and the two cars collided at the first corner. Massa spun, but rejoined the race behind Bourdais. Three laps later, the stewards announced that they were investigating the incident, and would make their decision after the race. On lap 52, Räikkönen attempted to pass Kubica on the approach to turn one after drafting behind him up the straight, but Kubica drove right as a blocking manoeuvre, braked late, and defended his position. On the following lap Kubica attempted to replicate his block, but Räikkönen out-braked him into turn one, and the two drew alongside. Kubica held the inside line on the turn three left-hander, and drove the racing line as Räikkönen left the track at the run-off area. Räikkönen then rejoined behind the BMW driver. Kubica faced similar challenges from Räikkönen over the next two laps into turn one, but he successfully defended his position.\nMassa made a pit stop on lap 53, and rejoined behind Heidfeld in tenth. He subsequently set the fastest lap of the race on lap 55, a 1:18.426. Meanwhile, Piquet was able to close the gap on Räikkönen to under a second, before losing time by running wide at turn five on lap 60. Massa passed Heidfeld for ninth on the same lap, and began closing in on Webber. On lap 65, Massa drafted down the straight and attempted to pass Webber, who defended his position by driving to the right. Crossing the track boundary into the end of the pit-lane, Massa managed to pass Webber, and out-braked him into turn one, to take eighth place. Alonso crossed the finish line on lap 67 to take his second win of the season, five seconds ahead of Kubica. Räikkönen was third, ahead of Piquet, Trulli, Bourdais, Vettel and Massa. Webber took ninth on the line, ahead of Heidfeld, who struggled with a heavy car and failed to improve on a poor qualifying performance. Rosberg finished in front of Hamilton, in 11th. Barrichello and Button took the next two positions; both drivers blamed their Honda cars for their uncompetitive performance at the Fuji circuit. Nakajima finished last, in 15th, unable to recover after his forced pit-stop early in the race.\nPost-race.\nThe top three finishers appeared in the subsequent press conference where Alonso said that the decision to run a shorter second stint than Kubica (between the first and second pit stops) was his decision: \"Sometimes you can do it, sometimes you can't but today the car was perfect and I was able to do it.\" Alonso added that he had confidence in the car to perform at the remaining Grands Prix: \"The feeling I have now is that we can do anything\". Kubica said that his second-placed finish was better than his win at the earlier in the season. He added that to finish on the podium after BMW Sauber's failure to improve the car from the beginning of the season was a \"great result for the team in, I think, a very difficult moment\". Räikkönen said that he was \"a bit disappointed because being in first place in the first corner but then being pushed out didn't help and being in the front could have given us a better result but anyhow, that's racing\". He added that Kovalainen's impact with him at the first corner had caused handling difficulties in his car, which left him unable to improve on his third-placed finish.\nForty minutes after the race, Bourdais received a 25-second penalty from the stewards for his collision with Massa on lap 50. This demoted him from sixth to tenth, and promoted Massa to seventh, giving him one more Championship point. Bourdais blamed Massa for the incident:\nMassa denied responsibility, and agreed with the stewards' decision: \"I think there's little to say: I had already entered the turn and he hit me from behind, spinning me round.\" The penalty was largely criticized in the media. GrandPrix.com called the penalty \"bizarre\", saying that Bourdais \"could not just disappear\". James Allen of ITV said that in light of FIA race director Charlie Whiting's announcement prior to the race, which indicated that cars exiting the pit-lane would have right of way, the penalty was \"ridiculous\". French sporting newspaper \"L'Équipe\" criticized the stewards for their intervention, saying that both drivers held their lines and the collision was just a racing incident. Mark Blundell, who drove in Formula One for five years, called for former drivers to be part of the stewards meetings which award penalties: \"You can examine pieces of paper, graphs, telemetry, but you don't know what's going on in a driver's brain until you've experienced it.\" Blundell's suggestion eventually became fact – the 2010 season introduced a system whereby a former Formula One driver acted as a steward during each Grand Prix.\nLewis Hamilton was criticized for his aggressive drive into the first corner by much of the British press. Edward Gorman of \"The Times\" described Hamilton's move as \"impetuosity and untamed aggression\", adding that Hamilton \"gambled with a kamikaze attempt to get past Räikkönen\". The BBC's Andrew Benson said that \"Hamilton is still in a strong position but the Englishman will have to cut out the mistakes that have characterised his season if he is not to lose the championship for the second year in a row.\" In Italy, \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" said that Hamilton's start suffered from \"his usual excessive aggression\". Hamilton said \"I made a mistake and I paid for it.\"\nMassa's touch on Hamilton's car on lap two was labelled by the McLaren driver \"as deliberate as it could be\". Massa rejected the allegation, saying \"I had two wheels on the gravel. I could not stop the car and I was on the gravel because he pushed me into the gravel.\" Media coverage of the incident suggested that though the contact was Massa's fault, it was unintentional. Simon Arron, writing for \"The Daily Telegraph\", said Hamilton's accusation of deliberate contact was \"unworthy and unwise\", adding that the contact was simply a racing incident. The gap between the drivers in the Drivers' Championship after the race stood at five points, in Hamilton's favour, with two races remaining. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren's failure to score points, combined with Ferrari's third and seventh, moved Ferrari to a seven-point lead."

        "text": "The North Texas Mean Green men's basketball team represents the University of North Texas (UNT) in NCAA Division I college basketball, competing as a member of the American Athletic Conference.\nFor most of its history, the Mean Green have had patches of success, starting in the 1970s when the team received its first ever top-20 ranking under head coach Bill Blakeley as well as success in the late 1980s and early 1990s under head coach Jimmy Gales and then again in the mid to late 2000s under head coach Johnny Jones. Blakeley coached three consecutive 20-win seasons: 1975–76 (22-4); 1976–77 (21-6); 1977–78 (22-6). North Texas has appeared in the NCAA tournament on four occasions: 1988, 2007, 2010, and 2021, recording their first-ever tournament win in 2021. The Mean Green went on an especially strong run in the 2006–2010 era, with two tournament appearances, two conference championships, and posting more wins over this time period than any other Division I team in the state of Texas.\nThe 2011–12 and 2012–13 teams featured the only 5-star recruit to play for North Texas in Tony Mitchell. In one season, he became the program's all-time leader in blocks. Despite Mitchell being highly touted, his performance in his second year suffered and he ended up struggling under new head coach Tony Benford eventually falling to the 2nd round of the NBA draft.\nOn April 16, 2012, longtime head coach Johnny Jones was formally introduced as the next head coach of his alma mater LSU. His replacement, Tony Benford, was not able to capitalize on the program's momentum, resulting in a disappointing final year in the Sun Belt Conference and then more struggles in the Mean Green's new conference Conference USA.\nPrior to 1973, the Mean Green played in the Ken Bahnsen Gym, nicknamed the Snake Pit. They now play in The Super Pit which derives its name from the Snake Pit.\nRivals.\nWhile the Mean Green hold a fierce rivalry with the UTSA Roadrunners across athletics in general, the team's most contentious conference rivals in men's basketball currently are the UAB Blazers and FAU Owls. In 2023, the Mean Green and Blazers met four times in which UNT won the series, 3-1. The Blazers knocked the Mean Green out of the Conference USA tournament while the Mean Green defeated the Blazers in the 2023 NIT Championship. During the Grant McCasland era, there was also a stretch where the road team in the series won nine straight games. And while North Texas leads the historical series with FAU, a 2023 Final Four participant, 14-11, the Mean Green have dropped five straight games against the Owls by a combined 21 points, including a 77-71 loss in the 2024 AAC tournament.\nThe Mean Green briefly restored their rivalry with the SMU Mustangs the one year they shared in the AAC (2023-24), with the home team winning both matchups by an average of 2.5 points. It is unclear if the teams will continue the series once the Mustangs enter the ACC in 2024-25. The teams have only played 19 times since 1949-50.\nNotable Non-conference rivals include the University of Texas at Arlington Mavericks, and former Conference USA foes Louisiana Tech, Middle Tennessee, and Western Kentucky.\nPostseason results.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Mean Green have appeared in the NCAA tournament four times. Their combined record is 1–4.\nNIT results.\nThe Mean Green have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) three times consecutively, winning it in 2023. Their combined record is 7–2.\nCBI results.\nThe Mean Green have appeared in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) once, winning it in 2018. Their record is 5–1.\nNAIA Tournament results.\nThe Mean Green have appeared in the NAIA Tournament two times. Their record is 3–2.\nBroadcasts.\nNorth Texas games are broadcast on the radio by the Mean Green Sports Network, part of Learfield IMG College on 88.1 KNTU and 95.3 KHYI. Former Texas Rangers and Dallas Mavericks announcer Dave Barnett does play by play, along with Hank Dickenson on color commentary.\nTelevision broadcasts are carried by ESPN+, ESPN3, and C-USA TV."

        "text": "Two human polls made up the 2007–08 NCAA Division I men's basketball rankings, the AP Poll and the Coaches Poll, in addition to various publications' preseason polls.\nAP poll.\nThe Associated Press (AP) preseason poll was released on November 5, 2007. This poll is compiled by sportswriters across the nation. In Division I men's and women's college basketball, the AP Poll is largely just a tool to compare schools throughout the season and spark debate, as it has no bearing on postseason play. Generally, all top 25 teams in the poll are invited to the NCAA basketball tournament, also known as \"March Madness\".\nESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll.\nThe Coaches Poll is the second oldest poll still in use after the AP Poll. It is compiled by a rotating group of 31 college Division I head coaches. The Poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest points is then ranked #1; second highest is ranked #2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first place votes noted the quantity next to their name. Any team receiving votes after the top 25 are listed after the top 25 by their point totals. However, these are not real rankings: They are not considered #26, #27, etc. The maximum points a single team can earn is 775. The preseason poll was released on November 5, 2007."

The Renault auto group bought out Gitane cycles and also took over sponsorship of the team making the Renault–Elf–Gitane team that dominated the sport from 1978 to 1984. At the end of 1985, Renault decided to retire from the sport so French co-operative Système U took over sponsorship from 1986 to 1989 making the Système U–Gitane cycling team. During 1989 the team was called Super U–Raleigh–Fiat after one of the supermarkets owned by the Système U group and rider Laurent Fignon became the number one ranked rider in the sport with his wins in Milan–San Remo, Grand Prix des Nations, 1989 Giro d'Italia and a very close second in the 1989 Tour de France.\nIn 1990 Castorama then took over the sponsorship of the team. For the first two years the team rode on Raleigh bikes but then rode on Cyrille Guimard bikes. Guimard was general manager from 1990 to 1995 while Jacques Cadion, Bernard Quilfren and Pascal Dubois were directeur sportifs. Fignon left the team and Guimard in 1992. Guimard had been his longtime mentor. Jacky Durand gave the team one of its biggest successes in 1992 when he won the Tour of Flanders. Durand attacked (with four others) at 217 km to the finish where there were 14 hills and 6 sections of cobblestones to be crossed.\nIt was said that one innovation that Guimard and Fignon introduced with the founding of the team is the formation of a holding company that controls the riders and sponsors' contracts. Prior to the introduction of this system, riders were often contracted directly with the sponsoring companies."

        "title": "1988 State of Origin series",
        "text": "The 1988 State of Origin series was the seventh annual three-game series between the New South Wales and Queensland representative rugby league football teams to be contested entirely under 'state of origin' selection rules. Queensland enjoyed their first ever 3–0 series whitewash, mirroring a feat New South Wales had first achieved two years earlier. The series produced an ugly and enduring Origin image when in Game II the parochial Queensland crowd showered the Lang Park playing arena with beer cans in protest at the sin-binning of their captain Wally Lewis.\nNew South Wales had a new home for Origin football in 1988. The AU$68 million, 40,000 capacity all-seat Sydney Football Stadium, a rectangular stadium more suited to rugby league than the round Sydney Cricket Ground, had been built in 1987 and opened in time for the 1988 NSWRL season. The SFS was described in its early days as a white elephant and lacking in the character and history of its predecessor, the SCG. Queensland players described playing at the SFS in 1988 as like playing on neutral ground.\nGame I.\nComing into the 1988 opener, Queensland had not yet experienced an Origin match without Wally Lewis. Supporters were stunned when he was ruled out of game I with a shoulder injury. He had captained the Maroons on 20 occasions (out of 21 appearances) and won eight man-of-the-match awards, establishing himself as an Origin great. The selectors' answer to his absence was Peter Jackson the Canberra Raiders' resident comic who prided himself on wisecracks and high jinks. However Jackson had honed his organisational and kicking skills at Canberra and was ready to fill Lewis' role. Captaining the Maroons for the first time was Manly-Warringah's 1987 Premiership winning captain Paul Vautin.\nAfter 42,048 fans had attended the only Origin game in Sydney at the SCG in 1987, the Sydney fans voted with their feet at the new SFS when only 26,441 attended Game 1. The low crowd number was largely due to the NSWRL charging $34 per seat as pointed out by Channel 9 match commentator Darrell Eastlake. His fellow Ch.9 commentator, Supercoach Jack Gibson replied to his comments that with an hours wait fans could watch the game at home on television for free rather than pay the high ticket price.\nWith Queensland missing their captain and the world's best footballer Wally Lewis, New South Wales had expected to dominate in the encounter but were flat from the outset. In the first-ever Origin game held at the newly built Sydney Football Stadium and in front of a less than capacity crowd (the seats at the in-goal ends of the stadium were virtually empty), the Maroons seized upon what Vautin termed the \"neutral atmosphere\".\nNew five-eighth Jackson played well and fullback Gary Belcher provided support with general play kicking while pint-sized Allan Langer provided the attacking thrust. Jackson was a natural tackler and together with Paul Vautin led with words of inspiration. For the Blues, both Peter Sterling and Cliff Lyons tried hard but unlike Langer and Jackson had very little support from the Blues forwards.\nLanger scampered across the line twice to give Queensland a 12-6 lead at half-time and after the break the procession of Queensland tries continued. Jackson, Belcher and Origin debutant Alan McIndoe all scored (despite television replays showing that McIndoe didn't ground the ball and had actually knocked-on) to give the Maroons an unassailable 26-6 lead before two late tries to Andrew Ettingshausen and Mark McGaw earned New South Wales some respectability on the scoreboard. Arguably the best of the Blues on the night was their longest serving outside back, dual-international Michael O'Connor who looked dangerous whenever he touched the ball, while Ettingshausen got through a mountain of work trying to get NSW out from being pinned deep in their own half.\nGame II.\nNew South Wales played with passion, looked the better side in game II and were leading 6-4 with 18 minutes to go. Then Wally Lewis was sentenced to 5 minutes in the sin-bin by referee Mick Stone for dissent after a scuffle between Phil Daley and Greg Conescu developed into an all-in brawl. The parochial Queensland crowd was outraged and with their hero Lewis in the sheds the ground was showered with beer cans amid chants of \"send Stone off\".\nAfter order was restored the complexion of the game changed. The Blues were visibly rattled and a minute after play resumed big Maroon prop Sam Backo crashed over to give Queensland a 10-6 lead. When Allan Langer later clinched the game at 16-6 and the series by taking an inside pass from Conescu to score, Lewis by now back from his exile, carried Langer back from the Blues' tryline in jubilation.\nGame III.\nGame III of 1988 was barely a contest and the feeble Sydney crowd of 16,910 reflected as much. With the series already decided, both teams opened up in a game of entertaining, free-flowing football. Queensland were unstoppable and Sam Backo grabbed a try double as the Maroons raced in seven tries to whip the Blues 38–22. Queensland had swept New South Wales 3–0 in their maiden whitewash.\nAftermath.\nFollowing Queensland's first ever 3-0 Origin series whitewash, a record 9 Maroons were chosen for the first Ashes series test against the touring Great Britain Lions with the only Blues selected being fullback Garry Jack, winger Andrew Ettingshausen, centre Michael O'Connor, halfback Peter Sterling, front rower Phil Daley, the only NSW player in an almost all Queensland forward pack, and reserve forward Steve Folkes."

New South Wales took a 1-0 series lead with a convincing victory in Game I on 21 May 2008. After some key personnel changes, Queensland then achieved a record 30-point margin to win Game II on 11 June 2008 to level, and on 2 July won Game III 16 - 10 to take the series 2-1 and edge one ahead in the cumulative series tally.\nThe series marked Mal Meninga's third as Queensland coach and also his third consecutive series victory. Johnathan Thurston was judged the player of the series. The 2008 series also set new nationwide television audience records for State of Origin.\nGame I.\nThe New South Wales side came to Origin I well prepared by Craig Bellamy, brought in to coach against Meninga, who was captaining Canberra in the 1990 NSWRL season's Grand final victory when Bellamy played for them from the interchange bench. Six of Meninga's Maroons were members of Bellamy's club, the Melbourne Storm. Queensland were missing their injured captain and playmaker Darren Lockyer but were spoilt for choice for fullbacks with Melbourne's Billy Slater and the Broncos' Karmichael Hunt in tremendous season form. Maroons selectors opted to experiment with Hunt at five-eighth.\nThe Blues forwards ran at the Queensland playmakers and Cameron Smith and Hunt were forced to do a mountain of defence. Steady and deep kicks from Blues debutant Peter Wallace (a late call up to the side during the week following the withdrawal of Kurt Gidley) kept Slater returning from deep in his territory often without easy linkage to his wing supports.\nQueensland took a long time to get out of first gear - Thurston's first kick of the night was low and travelled only 35 metres. The Blues however worked the ball through the hands with confidence and began to move it wide early. New South Wales played down their left hand side for the first two tries, both scored by debutant winger Anthony Quinn. One came through the hands with five-eighth Greg Bird, creating space via a cut out pass to Ryan Hoffman. The other resulted from a well executed kick from Peter Wallace.\nQueensland scored late in a first half almost devoid of penalties and errors and they made a better showing after half-time with a few breaks and by picking up on some New South Wales errors. However, their efforts came to nothing in the face of an all round defensive effort from the Blues, including a number of try-saving and punishing tackles by try-scorer Quinn supported by his three-quarter teammate Matt Cooper.\nThurston lifted in the second-half and threatened with a number of well-paced grubber kicks in- behind but he was marked closely by the man-of-the-match Greg Bird and the vigilant defence of Ryan Hoffman who also kept Folau and Inglis well contained. Slater showed touches of brilliance but at times was outshone by Mark Gasnier who was dangerous all night and had a hand in two Blues tries. Hunt defended heroically throughout but every big tackle he made sapped something from his attacking spark. Eventually the Maroons ran out of steam and another Blues debutant in Anthony Laffranchi crossed in the 68th minute, taking the score to 18-4. Again at the death of the second half Queensland picked up another late try out wide through debutant Folau.\nGame II.\nQueensland made ten positional-personnel changes for Origin II: Boyd debuted as Winger replacing Tate; Tate moved to Centre replacing Hodges (suspended on a tackling charge in the NRL round 11); Thurston moved to Five-eighth after Lockyer was again ruled out unfit after initially being named in the side; Prince was called into the side at Half-back, replacing Thurston; Thaiday moved to the interchange bench; Price back from injury as Prop replacing Webb (dropped); Hunt moved to fullback thus Slater replacing Marsh (dropped) on interchange; Myles swapped with Thaiday to second row; Harrison onto the interchange bench, replacing Lillyman (dropped). New South Wales on the other hand made only four player changes: Turner debuted as winger replacing Hayne (suspended on a tackling charge in NRL round 11); Fitzgibbon moved to starting prop, replacing Cross (injured in game I); Simpson was moved onto the interchange bench for Fitzgibbon; Gidley (who had been named for game I, but suffered an eye injury in the club round prior) replacing Hornby who moved to 18th Man.\nDarius Boyd on debut scored Queensland's first two tries, and with two penalty goals kicked by Thurston, Queensland held a 16–0 lead at half-time. Another penalty just after the break, then two further converted tries between the 65th and the 70th minute, made it 30–0 to Queensland.\nGreg Inglis answered his critics from game I and spoke after the match of \"getting one back on Gaz\" (referring to having been outshone in game I by Mark Gasnier) with a blistering performance setting up both tries for Boyd from long range beating Gasnier and embarrassing the defence of Blues debutante Steve Turner in the process. The Queensland forwards were consistently up fast in defence and flustered New South Wales. Blues halves Greg Bird and Peter Wallace seemed at times bereft of attacking ideas and whilst Wallace had a reasonable kicking game, the control demonstrated by the pair in game I was not to be seen.\nAs predicted by the pre-match press, the Blues attack was aimed at Scott Prince wherever possible but he was ably assisted by Brent Tate, defending alongside him. Tate made thirty-three tackles in the game and regularly featured in attacking returns from loose play. Queensland were strong across the park with Johnathan Thurston shining, Israel Folau showing his class and veterans Steve Price and Petero Civoniceva giving tireless service.\nFor New South Wales, the only flawless performances were by captain Danny Buderus and fullback Brett Stewart, who pulled off a number of solo try-saving tackles. Otherwise the tables were completely turned from game I and Blues had no answers for a Maroons outfit this time perfectly prepared by coach Meninga. Queensland had levelled the series with a 30–0 win, only the second time in history that New South Wales were held scoreless.\nThe national TV audience peaked at 2.49 million viewers, which was a new record.\nGame III.\nComing into the decider, Queensland's record at the venue (dating back to 1999) was 1 win, 11 losses and a draw.\nQueensland made no changes to their lineup for the decider while New South Wales made seven: Hayne returned from suspension and replaced Turner on the Wing; Cross, back from injury replaced Simpson; Anasta and Pearce formed a new halves pairing replacing the injured Bird and Wallace; Monaghan replaced Gasnier out with a back injury; Fitzgibbon moved to the Second-row and Mason to Prop.\nIn starting, Danny Buderus beat two Blues standing records - Harragon's for consecutive matches and Fittler's for most games as captain. Much of the media build-up focused on the match being his state representative farewell, as well as Mitchell Pearce's debut and Braith Anasta's State of Origin comeback. Blues' utility Kurt Gidley had been shuffled at the last minute into the starting line-up over Brett Stewart, resulting in formal pre-match protest from Queensland. The decision to bench Stewart was perplexing, who was arguably the Blues' best in game 1 and 2.\nAfter one minute of Game III a tackle was made on New South Wales forward Ben Cross by the Queenslanders which sparked a brawl. A penalty was awarded to the Blues and Craig Fitzgibbon kicked it, putting NSW in front 2 - 0. In the fifth minute the Maroons were advancing on the Blues' line when Queensland halfback Scott Prince put a high kick up to the right corner which Bues winger Anthony Quinn failed to catch, allowing Israel Folau to grab the ball and simply fall over the try-line. Johnathan Thurston missed the conversion, leaving the score at 2 - 4 in favour of the Maroons. Ten minutes later Queensland were a man down after Prince's forearm was broken in a tackle and the New South Welshmen capitalised, working the ball up close to the Maroons' line and out to left centre Matt Cooper to stretch out through the defence and plant the ball. Fitzgibbon added the extras to give his team an 8 - 4 lead. In the twenty-second minute, the Queenslanders were again attacking close to the Blues' try-line when from in front of the posts Thurston put a kick up high and across to Folau's wing. Folau, coming through at speed, leapt above his opposite number to grab the ball and as he fell awkwardly back down, managed to ground it one-handed behind his head in what was a remarkable effort. The conversion was missed by Thurston so the scores were level at 8 - 8. A few minutes later, New South Wales hooker Danny Buderus ran from dummy half, catching the Maroons' defence off-side and gaining his team a penalty, which Fitzgibbon successfully kicked, giving the Blues a 10 - 8 lead. No more points were scored before half time.\nNew South Wales started the second half with repeat sets of six in Queensland's half of the field. A loose ball in the Maroons' in-goal was dived on by Anasata, but the video referee found that it was a penalty to Queensland. The maroons' following set of six ended with another penalty to them in attacking position, with Thurston kicking the two points to level at 10 - 10. Queensland forward Nate Myles was lucky not to be sent off (but was later suspended for 6 weeks) for a tackle in the forty-eighth minute which upended Ben Cross and resulted in another minor scuffle and a penalty to the Blues, but the Maroons withstood NSW's attack. A few minutes later the game was halted when Queensland forward Michael Crocker was knocked out as Mitchell Pearce's attempted clearing kick sent the ball into the back of his head. Just at the sixty-seven minute mark Thurston, from within his own half, got the ball at first-receiver and threw a dummy, slicing through the defensive line before passing to Billy Slater running through in support to score the match-winning try under the posts. The conversion was simple and Queensland regained the lead at 10 - 16. In the final minutes the Blues attacked the Maroons' line repeatedly but could not break through and Queensland had won their third series in a row, replicating \"three-peats\" achieved in 1982, 1983, 1984 and 1987, 1988, 1989.\nThe national TV audience peaked at more than 2.5 million, breaking the record set in the last game.\nTeams.\nNew South Wales Blues \nQueensland Maroons \n1 - Injury replacement (does not play)."

Julian was the youngest of five international-level hockey playing brothers, the others being Cec, Mel, Eric and Gordon.\nFollowing the partition of India, his father Cec and elder brothers Cec and Mel settled in Perth, Western Australia in 1947. His mother Gladys arrived in 1948 with Julian and the two other brothers. The Anglo-Indian family had intended on settling in Victoria but instead chose to stay in Western Australia.\nTall and solidly built, Julian was highly regarded as a defender, being the odd man out as all four of his brothers were better known as forwards. In 1958 he captained the state Colts team and in the same year joined his brothers in the state senior side in which the team enjoyed a win in the national final against New South Wales. This was the only time the five brothers competed alongside each other. Julian represented Western Australia also in 1959, 1960, 1964, 1965 and 1968.\nHe joined Eric and Gordon in the Australian team at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome and in 1962 went to India in the Ten-Nation Championship—the forerunner to today's Hockey World Cup. In 1964 he went to Tokyo Olympics with Eric where Australia managed a bronze medal and in 1968 at Mexico City won silver with Eric and Gordon.\nPearce retired from international hockey in 1970 but continued in the Western Australian grade competition, playing with and coaching Trinity until the mid-1980s.\nHe was inducted into the Western Australian Hall of Champions in 1987 and the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1999."

        "text": "Christopher L. Howard (born May 5, 1975) is a former professional American football running back who played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Jacksonville Jaguars. Howard had been drafted by the Denver Broncos in the fifth round of the 1998 NFL Draft. His professional football career was haunted by fumble troubles, which caused the Broncos to release him before he played a regular season game for them. Howard began to have fumble problems again when the Jaguars acquired and promoted him to a role as a regular player.\nHe had previously played for the Michigan Wolverines football team where in the 1997 NCAA Division I-A football season, his final year at Michigan, they won a national championship. Howard led the National Champion 1997 Michigan Wolverines football team in rushing and was a Hula Bowl MVP in 1998. Chris attended Louisiana high school football powerhouse, John Curtis Christian High School in River Ridge, Louisiana. He was formerly married to Gabrielle Union.\nEarly years.\nHoward was born in Kenner, Louisiana. He enrolled at Michigan after playing for Louisiana High School football powerhouse John Curtis Christian High School.\nCollege career.\nIn four years at Michigan from 1994 to 1997, he totaled 1876 yards rushing on 418 carries and added 429 yards receiving on 60 receptions. He totaled nine 100-yard rushing efforts for Michigan including four during the 1997 championship season. In college, his biggest rushing effort was 127 yards against the Minnesota Golden Gophers in 1996. However, he once rushed for 109 yards and 4 touchdowns against the UCLA Bruins. In addition, Howard also posted the fourth longest rush in school history, an 86-yard rush.\nIn 1996, he had five 100-yard games despite only playing in ten games as a junior. He totaled 725 yards rushing and ten touchdowns in the ten games. However, he was second on the team in rushing to sophomore Clarence Williams who tallied 837 yards in 12 games.\nIn the 1997 championship season, he was the rushing leader for an undefeated 12–0 Michigan team that did not have a 1000-yard rusher or 500-yard receiver. The team emphasized defense behind 1997 Heisman Trophy winning defensive back Charles Woodson. Howard totaled 938 yards rushing on 199 carries and 276 yards receiving on 37 receptions. He was second on the team in scoring to placekicker Kraig Baker with 7 rushing touchdowns and 1 receiving touchdown. He was complemented in the backfield by freshman Anthony Thomas who added 549 yards and 5 rushing touchdowns.\nOne of the key games in Michigan's 1997 National Championship season was the game against the unbeaten Penn State Nittany Lions, then ranked Number 2 in the nation. Howard rushed for 120 yards and a touchdown in the win over the Nittany Lions, prompting Coach Lloyd Carr to comment: \"I think that Chris Howard is a very underrated back. He proved that today.\" Michigan controlled the game and led 34–0 after 3 quarters behind Howard’s best collegiate performance in terms of yards from scrimmage with 120 yards rushing and 41 yards receiving.\nThe 1997 season concluded with a 21–16 win over Washington State in the January 1, 1998 Rose Bowl. Howard led all rushers in the game with 70 yards rushing on 19 carries.\nHe was also the North MVP for the 1998 edition of the Hula Bowl, an invitational college football all-star game. He rushed for 116 yards on 14 carries and was involved in the culminating score in the North’s second half comeback. He handed off to Joe Jurevicius on a reverse play which ended with Jurevicius passing to Brian Griese for a five-yard touchdown pass. The North would lose, however, when the missed extra point left the door open for a game-winning field goal.\nProfessional career.\nHoward was selected by the Denver Broncos in the fifth round of the 1998 NFL Draft, but he had a difficult pre-season with the Broncos in 1998, fumbling five times in two games. The Broncos released him from their practice squad in September 1998, and he was signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars. At the time, Jacksonville Coach Tom Coughlin said: \"Chris Howard is a young man and he certainly still is developmental. A couple weeks into our system and I think he'll be a guy who can be counted on. But I'm not going to say we're done with our evaluations just yet.\" Coughlin said of Howard's fumbles with Denver: \"It was carelessness. Basically, we'll start from scratch with him fundamentally here.\" Howard had professional totals of 123 yards rushing on 41 carries and 37 yards receiving on five receptions. In 2000, his final year, he fumbled twice on only 21 carries in the first two games. These were his final two career NFL games.\nPersonal life.\nOn May 5, 2001, Howard married actress Gabrielle Union, whom he met in 1999. They separated in 2005 and their divorce was made final in April 2006."

        "title": "Scotland A national rugby union team",
        "text": "The Scotland A team are the second national rugby union team behind the Scottish national side. The first Scotland 'A' fixture took place in 1990.\nHistory.\nUnlike association football, where the main team is supposed to be the \"A\" team, Scotland 'A' in rugby union is actually equivalent to the Scotland B football team. The Scotland 'A' side in rugby union is classed as a senior national side, along with the full national side and the Scotland 7s international side. When players play for any of these 3 senior sides; they commit their nationality to Scotland; and cannot then normally switch nationality to another international side. The parlance used deems these sides as 'capture' sides.\nThere was a history of national development sides in Scotland before the national 'A' side was introduced. The non-cap Scotland XV side started in 1969, the Scotland 'B' side introduced in 1971 was for uncapped players; and the start of the age-grade pathway sides - like the Under 21 side - which began in 1984.\nScotland XV, Scotland 'B' and age-grade sides.\nScotland's status as one of the leading rugby nations in the Northern Hemisphere, made the SRU look to field a second team, first known as Scotland XV, which can play at the same level, sometimes even superior, of many second and third tier nations first sides. This team was a development side and players selected were not given caps and not tied to Scotland.\nThe Scotland XV first played in 1969, beating an Argentina side 20 - 3. These non-cap matches have proven controversial and there was a campaign to get players that were capped by the Scotland XV side as full caps. However the campaign failed; and these XV matches remain non-capped matches.\nScotland XV represented Scotland during the 1999 Rugby World Cup – European qualification, easily defeating Portugal by 85–11, and Spain by 85–3, in Murrayfield.\nThe launch of the Scotland 'B' side in 1971 provided uncapped players another route for recognition; this was a development side; no fully capped players were eligible. Like the Scotland XV side before it, this was not a 'capture' side.\nThe start of the Scotland age-grade teams in 1984 - on the launch of the national Under 21 side - were another pathway. Age-grade sides are not intended to be 'capture' sides; and their use as capture sides up to and including the Under 20 age-group range has now been banned by World Rugby.\nScotland 'A'.\nThe 'A' side was launched as the second senior men's side in 1990, with the intention of giving a more formal step up to international rugby.\nThe Scotland 'A' side and Scotland 'B' side ran concurrently between 1990 and 1992; and are not regarded as similar. Indeed, players like Ian Corcoran, Douglas Wyllie and Damian Cronin have both Scotland 'A' and Scotland 'B' caps.\nThe 'A' side is used as an official 'capture' side for securing residency or otherwise qualified players for Scotland's international selection. Unlike the Scotland 'B' side there is no bar on fully-capped players playing for the 'A' side, although fully capped players are usually restricted to a few in the squad selection; primarily to provide leadership to the other players.\nBefore the professional era, Scotland 'A' played against touring national sides from the southern hemisphere.\nCurrent squad.\nGregor Townsend named a 23 man 'A' squad to face Chile on 25 June 2022.\nDespite the history of rugby links between the two countries, this was the first ever rugby match between Scotland and Chile. \nHead Coach: Gregor Townsend\nCompetitions.\nThey used to compete in the Churchill Cup alongside the full national teams of Canada and the United States as well as Ireland A, England Saxons, Argentina A and the New Zealand Māori.\nThey competed in the IRB Nations Cup, winning the competition in 2009 and ending last in 2010."

He is the third-highest drafted kicker in NFL history, behind Charlie Gogolak (6th, 1966) of Princeton and Russell Erxleben (11th, 1979) of Texas. Little was drafted higher than future NFL greats Ozzie Newsome and Todd Christensen.\nLittle was an All-American placekicker and punter during his years at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. He kicked an NCAA record-tying 67-yard field goal on October 15, 1977. That record has yet to be broken; it was set by Erxleben two weeks earlier on October 1, 1977, and is shared with Joe Williams of Wichita State (October 21, 1978).\nHigh school and college career.\nLittle played high school football for Shawnee Mission South High School in Overland Park, Kansas, where he was an all-state quarterback and defensive back. He was recruited to play football for the University of Arkansas by legendary Arkansas head coach Frank Broyles. Broyles later said that he initially recruited Little to play quarterback since Joe Ferguson had recently graduated and entered the NFL. However Little's kicking abilities so impressed Broyles that they utilized him in that position. Also coach Bo Rein had recently accepted an assistant coaching position with Arkansas, and was bringing with him high school standout quarterback Ron Calcagni.\nIn 1975, Little helped Arkansas in its defeat of Georgia in the Cotton Bowl. In 1977, he earned All-America honors and kicked a still-standing NCAA D-I record 67-yard field goal against Texas on Oct. 15th. He helped the Razorbacks to an upset victory in the Orange Bowl over Oklahoma. During Little's career with Arkansas, the Razorbacks went in 1975, in 1976, and in 1977. During his final year at Arkansas Little played under head coach Lou Holtz.\nProfessional career.\nLittle was selected fifteenth in the 1978 NFL draft by the St. Louis Cardinals. Despite the anticipation surrounding his kicking skills demonstrated in college, he performed at a dismal level as a professional. Little served as both punter and placekicker; in his brief 33-game NFL career, he punted for a total of 4,809 yards, but had a disappointing field goal percentage of 48.1% over less than three seasons. He did kick a 51-yard field goal, the fifth-longest in Cardinals history, but also missed ten extra points in 51 attempts. Little's problems off the field also caused him issues with the team; with a new head coach in 1980, he was released six games into the season on October 16, replaced by kicker Neil O'Donoghue.\nHours after his release by the Cardinals, Little was involved in a high-speed single car accident, which broke his neck and left him a Little died in 1999 at age 43, having spent years as a quadriplegic in hospice in Little Rock, Arkansas, where he lived with and was cared for by his brother Gene Little. Little is on the All-Century team at Arkansas, and is also listed as #11 on the list of greatest Arkansas football players of all time."

With the introduction of the Brisbane and Gold Coast clubs to the New South Wales Rugby League premiership the following year, after this series all players in State of Origin would be sourced from NSWRL teams. The final five BRL players selected for Queensland were captain Wally Lewis, Gene Miles, Allan Langer, Colin Scott and Greg Conescu, all of whom joined the Brisbane Broncos in 1988.\nGames.\nGame I.\nMark Murray had missed just one Origin clash in the first five series but when he suffered a serious eye injury that forced his premature retirement in the off-season of 1986, it was widely expected that in-form Eastern Suburbs half-back Laurie Spina would be called into the side after good form for the Roosters and impressing in a Qld selection trial at Lang Park. Instead, and against the wishes of coach Wayne Bennett, the Maroons selectors opted for the jockey-sized Ipswich Jets half-back Allan Langer then just 68 kg and a month shy of his 21st birthday. Spina would never again get the chance to represent Queensland.\nIn his first match at Origin level, Langer proved he was a worthy partner for Wally Lewis in the halves and silenced his doubters with a performance that went close to earning him the man-of-the-match award which was won by Blues' second rower Les Davidson.\nWith only minutes left in the game the scores were locked at 16-all and heading for the first drawn result when referee Mick Stone made one of the best refereeing decisions in Origin history under immense pressure in front of a rabid Queensland crowd. New South Wales' half-back Peter Sterling missed with a field-goal attempt before launching a final backline raid down the right hand side of the field. Cronulla Sharks centre Andrew Ettingshausen, on debut and playing on the wing, sent his club team-mate Mark McGaw away on a long burst down the sideline. Cornered by the converging defence, McGaw threw an inside pass that was knocked down by Queensland but was kicked ahead into the Maroons' in-goal. In a flurry of action that saw arms, legs and bodies flailing in desperation, a hand reached out and grounded the ball just before it skidded dead.\nReferee Stone was forced to make a split second pivotal decision without the help of the video referee backup of today's game. Stone ruled that McGaw had touched down centimetres inside the dead-ball line for a try, despite the protests of the Qld players and the 33,000 strong Lang Park crowd yelling for him to call in their favour and prevent the Maroons from losing their 7th game from the past 8 contests. While video replays ultimately proved inconclusive, leaving the decision a controversial one still debated among many today, Stone was adamant that the try had been scored and later confirmed that had there not been a try scored, he would have awarded a penalty try to NSW in any case as Qld centre Peter Jackson had attempted to hold back McGaw by grabbing his jumper.\nGame II.\nGame II at the Sydney Cricket Ground in front of a record Origin crowd of 42,048 was played in torrential rain. The powerful kicking of Lewis and fullback Gary Belcher was superior to the Blues' who were forced to play much of the match in their own half. Queensland capitalised on New South Wales' errors to emerge with a 12-6 victory. On his 27th birthday, Peter Sterling earned the man-of-the-match award, a rare honour for a player on the losing side.\nBefore the game, and despite Queensland having won Origin from 1980–84, as New South Wales had won the 1985 and 1986 series and 7 of the previous 8 games going into game 2 (dating back to Game 3 in 1984), and with the addition of the Brisbane Broncos and Gold Coast Seagulls into the Sydney premiership in 1988, some in the Sydney press were wondering about the future of Origin with the general feeling being that the Blues were set to embark on another period of domination like the one that had brought about the Origin concept in the first place. Queensland's gutsy win under pressure and in adverse conditions silenced the critics.\nGame III.\nThe series decider at Lang Park was a classic Origin knife's-edge encounter that swung from one end of the field to the other. Queensland scored two brilliantly conceived tries to lead 10-8 at halftime and defied the Blues in a scoreless second half of incredible tension. After referee Barry Gomersall ruled New South Wales centre Michael O'Connor offside from a Cliff Lyons kick (though television replays showed it was line-ball), Queensland winger Dale Shearer kicked a penalty goal in the 39th minute, giving the Maroons a two-point win and the Series. Langer was a triumphant figure for Queensland and in his third Origin game was named 'man of the match' after playing the game of his life.\nCalifornia Game 4.\nLater in the season a match was played at Long Beach, California. The game did not count toward the series, but the match retained State of Origin status and is included in the records and player appearance calculations.\nIt was billed as an historic occasion for the game and an opportunity for rugby league to grab a foothold in the United States. It was a bold endeavour, but ultimately the match failed to create a lasting impression on America's sporting consciousness. There was minimal press coverage of the game and disputes over the size of the crowd, with many tickets reportedly given away."

More traditional movements of the extremities are restricted or barred and forward motion is accomplished by dolphin-like undulation of hips and paired feet. These styles emulate the motions of mammals such as the seal, dolphin, sea lion, whale, otter, and beaver, which have evolved adaptations to water that enable them to attain an optimal swimming ability.\nThe Georgian style of swimming (Colchian and Iberian style) was revived by the swimmer Henry Kuprashvili. He laid foundation of Georgian styles of swimming study process and established the school of swimming.\nHistory.\nIn the beginning of the 1960s, Levan Kursua (1887-1969), a resident of the seaside village of Ergeta (Anaklia) in Mingrelia (Colchis), retold a Georgian legend about Colchian (Lazica) and Iberian warriors who, as part of their training, used a style of swimming where their hands and feet were bound firmly. His narrative proposed that while, initially daunting, this style of swimming could also be used as a regimen to develop discipline and physical stamina in martial culture:\nThe revival of these unique Georgian style of swimming started at the “Lagune Vere” sports complex in Tbilisi.\nDimitri Dick, originally from Germany, is the first Georgian coach who was actively inculcated in the styles of Georgian swimming as part of the professional sportsmen training program at “Laguna Vere”.

The games were played in Helsinki and Tampere with eight teams playing a single round-robin, followed by the top four teams playing each other once more. This was the 48th World Championships, and also the 59th European Championships of ice hockey. The Soviet Union became World Champions for the 18th time, and also won their 21st European Championship.\nThe tournament is notable since Canada, reinforced by Wayne Gretzky after the Edmonton Oilers were shockingly knocked out of the Stanley Cup playoffs by Los Angeles, would have won the silver medal if the Soviet team had beaten Czechoslovakia in the final game. However, the teams played to a scoreless tie, knocking the Canadians down to the bronze; this led to speculation that the Soviets and Czechs had played to a draw on purpose. Gretzky did score more points than any other player in the tournament (14), in his only appearance at the World Championships, but the Soviet Union's Viktor Shalimov was selected as \"Best Forward\".\nOther notable events include the Czechs' loss to West Germany for the first time in forty-five years, since being beaten in triple overtime to then-Nazi Germany in 1937. The Italians (with a squad boasting seventeen Italian Canadians), beat the Americans and became the first promoted team to survive relegation since the tournament expanded to eight teams in 1959. The tourney was a disaster for the Americans; just two years after winning gold at the 1980 Winter Olympics, they lost every game but one, a tie with West Germany on the final day. The U.S. was thus relegated to Group B for 1983 (they won that tourney and were promoted in 1984 to the top group, where they have been ever since).\nOrganization of the tournament was overseen by Kalervo Kummola, the chief executive officer of SM-liiga.\nWorld Championship Group A (Finland).\nFirst round.\n\"The United States was relegated to Group B.\"\nWorld Championship Group B (Austria).\nPlayed in Klagenfurt, Austria from March 18–27. Like the finals of Group A, the Group B tournament also ended in controversy. After the Chinese had defeated the Dutch (relegating them), China would also avoid relegation -- unless Romania and Switzerland played to a tie. They did just that (3-3) on March 27, in a match derided as a \"scandalous parody\" by some observers; Romania thus finished with three head-to-head points, Switzerland two, and China one, relegating the Chinese.\n\"East Germany was promoted to Group A, and both China and the Netherlands were relegated.\"\nWorld Championship Group C (Spain).\nPlayed in Jaca March 19–28.\n\"Both Japan and Yugoslavia were promoted to Group B.\"\nRanking.\nFinal standings.\nThe final standings of the tournament according to IIHF:\nEuropean championships final standings.\nThe final standings of the European championships according to IIHF:\nScoring leaders.\nList shows the top skaters sorted by points, then goals."

        "title": "1984 State of Origin series",
        "text": "The 1984 State of Origin series was the third time the annual three-game series between the representative rugby league football teams of New South Wales and Queensland was played entirely under \"state of origin\" selection rules. With Queensland wrapping up the series in the first two matches it produced the first dead rubber finish and an infamous opening minute brawl in game II.\nGame I.\nThe New South Wales attitude to State of Origin had changed somewhat for the 1984 series, with the Blues squad being excused from their club duties the weekend prior to the first match and undergoing an intensive training camp, signalling the NSWRL's commitment to taking the series seriously. Canterbury-Bankstown halfback Steve Mortimer was originally selected as the Blues halfback, but withdrew with a hamstring injury. Mortimer later confirmed he had actually faked the injury as he wasn't happy with the selection of long-time rival Peter Sterling on the bench. Mortimer felt that with Sterling's Parramatta team mate Ray Price as team captain, he would not have a voice or be able to run the team on the field as he wished to. Sterling was elevated to the starting line up after Mortimer's withdrawal with St George's Brian Hetherington selected as the reserve back.\nQueensland were motivated by the announcement that New South Wales coach Frank Stanton had been appointed as Australian national coach for the upcoming Ashes series against Great Britain. Queensland's own coach and favoured Origin son, Arthur Beetson was being dumped in favour of Stanton and notwithstanding that Stanton was merely returning to the helm having previously steered the national side on two triumphant Kangaroo tours, the Maroons were keen to avenge the honour of Beetson who had been dumped as Australian coach following the Kangaroos 19–12 loss to New Zealand at Lang Park in 1983.\nThe Maroons won the match 29–12 with Manly-Warringah winger Kerry Boustead achieving the rare Origin honour of scoring three tries. Mal Meninga had a poor night with the boot, only kicking two goals from eight attempts. It was rumoured that this ultimately cost him a place in the Australian team for the first Ashes test with NSW goalkicking winger Ross Conlon winning a spot on the wing.\nGame II.\nGame II was played on a cold and wet night that saw almost 30,000 cram into the Sydney Cricket Ground, signalling that the New South Wales public had finally embraced the Origin concept. The mud, rain and tolerant eye of referee Barry Gomersall combined to form an explosive mix. Progress was arduous in the SCG quagmire and handling almost impossible.\nBlues prop Steve Roach triggered an all-in brawl in the second tackle of the match with players trading blows for more than a minute afterwards in three separate melees. The sight of Chris Close, his jumper torn off, going blow-for-blow with New South Wales lock Ray Price became an enduring Origin image. When order was finally restored, Gomersall merely awarded a penalty against the Blues (which he had already called just as the fight started) and allowed play to continue.\nBoth sides dug in for a slogging defensive contest and not surprisingly, when Gomersall called a halt for half-time, neither side had scored. So bad were conditions, Blues second-rower Noel Cleal attempted a line drop out only for the ball to stick in the gluey mud and trickle a metre forward. In contrast, Wally Lewis had earlier kicked a drop out some 40 metres downfield which drew a glare from Gomersall, especially as a quarter line drop out from Lewis just 10 minutes into the game had barely travelled 10 metres. Lewis later admitted that he had distracted Gomersall by calling for his team to stay onside. When Gomersall looked away to check, Lewis kicked the ball but caught it before it hit the ground. The deadlock was only broken when Mal Meninga landed a penalty goal. shortly afterwards Queensland prop Greg Dowling scored a memorable Origin try. Lewis had been peppering the New South wales line with his searching kicks and chipped ahead, aiming for the in-goal area. In a moment of good fortune for the Maroons the ball struck the cross-bar and Dowling who had been following through, took an extraordinary catch on his finger tips centimetres from the rain soaked ground and plunged across the line in a splash of mud to score and give Queensland an 8–0 lead.\nThe Blues responded with a penalty goal to winger Ross Conlon reducing the Queensland lead to a converted try but when Maroon centre Gene Miles powered his way over the line from dummy half, the Queensland lead extended to 14–2 and there was no way back for the Blues.\nGame III.\nWith the series decided in Sydney, game III at Lang Park became a dead-rubber but was significant for the selection of Canterbury Bulldogs half-back Steve Mortimer as captain of New South Wales for the first time after Ray Price had elected to stand down from representative football following the third Ashes Test.\nNew South Wales selectors took the opportunity to blood a number of young players for the first time like Chris Mortimer, Pat Jarvis and Peter Wynn who along with Mortimer would play dominant roles in the Blues revival of 1985.\nMortimer inspired New South Wales to a 22–12 victory which avoided the embarrassment of a series whitewash and earned for himself the man of the match award."

        "text": "The Winthrop Eagles men's basketball team represents Winthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina, United States and competes in the Big South Conference. Winthrop plays their home games in the 6,100 seat Winthrop Coliseum. Winthrop has appeared in 11 NCAA Tournaments and has won 11 conference season championships, 13 conference tournament championships, and 1 conference division title. The Eagles have played 45 seasons of basketball since their inaugural 1978–79 campaign.\nTeam history.\nRise to mid-major prominence.\nDuring the late 1990s and 2000s, Winthrop established itself as one of the most successful mid-major programs in college basketball, reaching the NCAA Tournament eight times in 10 seasons. From 1998 to 2008, the Eagles posted a 216–95 overall record and went 114–28 in Big South play. During this stretch, Winthrop defeated programs from high major conferences like the ACC (Clemson, Georgia Tech, #19 Miami in 2007), Big East (Marquette, #17 Notre Dame in the NCAA tournament, Providence), and SEC (Georgia, Mississippi State). Winthrop also beat Missouri in 2000. \nSince 2009, Winthrop has defeated over 30 non-conference D1 teams including: Auburn (SEC), Clemson (ACC), Wake Forest (ACC), East Carolina, East Tennessee State, Furman, Georgia Southern, Illinois (Big 10), James Madison, Manhattan College, Ohio University, #18 Saint Mary's in 2019, St. Louis, UNC Greensboro, Portland, San Diego, Washington (PAC 12), and William &amp; Mary. Winthrop beat the ACC, SEC, PAC 12, and Big 10 schools at the opposing school.\nNeild Gordon era (1978–1986).\nWinthrop's first head coach, Neild Gordon, recorded 25 wins and 10 losses in the Eagle's first season. He finished with an average win percentage of .615 and 20 wins per season during his tenure at WU. Gordon was later inducted into Winthrop University's Athletics Hall of Fame, the Furman University Athletic Hall of Fame, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) Halls of Fame, and the South Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame.\nSteve Vacendak era (1986–1992).\nFormer Duke point guard and ACC Player of the Year, Steve Vacendak coached the Eagles from 1986 to 1992. In Winthrop's second season as a Division I program, he led the 4th seeded eagles to their first Big South tournament victory.\nDan Kenney era (1993–1998).\nDan Kenney was the head coach of the Eagles during the mid-1990s and finished his tenure with a record of 51-113. WU athletic director Tom Hickman reportedly said that Kenney \"graduated his players, ran a clean, upstanding program and did everything first class but had to be relieved of his coaching duties because the school could no longer carry his losing record.\"\nGregg Marshall era (1998–2007).\nGregg Marshall coached the Eagles from 1998 to 2007, engineering one of the great program turnarounds in NCAA history. In just his first season at the helm, he led the Eagles to a 21–8 record and an appearance in the 1999 Men's Division 1 Tournament. This success continued as his team would go on to make the Tournament in each of the next three seasons, establishing a winning tradition that would last into the 2010s. Overall, he posted a 194–83 overall record during his nine-year tenure. Marshall led the Eagles to a 104–24 conference record, six Big South season titles, and seven Big South tournament titles. Winthrop appeared in seven NCAA Tournaments, posted six 20-win seasons, and averaged 21.5 victories per year during the Marshall Era. In April 2007, Marshall left Winthrop to become the head coach at Wichita State.\nRandy Peele era (2007–2012).\nRandy Peele posted a 77–82 overall record (48–38 Big South) as head coach from 2007 to 2012. He led the Eagles to one Big South season title and two Big South tournament titles. Winthrop appeared in two NCAA Tournaments and notched one 20-win season under Peele's leadership. Randy Peele was relieved of his coaching duties at Winthrop on March 5, 2012.\nPat Kelsey era (2012–2021).\nFormer Xavier and Wake Forest assistant Pat Kelsey was announced as Winthrop's new coach on March 29, 2012. Over nine seasons with the Eagles, Kelsey went 186–95 (.662) overall and 110–46 (.705) in the Big South and led Winthrop to three Big South season championships (2016, 2017, 2021), three Big South tournament championships (2017, 2020, 2021), and three Big South Tournament runner-up finishes (2014, 2015, 2016). In 2020–21, Kelsey's last season with the team, the Eagles went nearly undefeated, finishing 23-2, and led the Big South in assists, steals, points per game, scoring margin, offensive rebounds, defensive rebounds, and rebounding offense.\nUnder Kelsey, the Eagles' style of play exhibited a fast-paced, high scoring offense and pack line defense. Kelsey's Eagles broke multiple school records in categories such as free throw accuracy, blocked shots, three-pointers made, offensive pace, and points scored in a single game.\nWith the help of assistant coaches like Brian Kloman, Kelsey developed a successful local and international recruiting pipeline and signed some of the top players in WU's history. This includes Winthrop's all-time leading rebounder and shot-blocker, Xavier Cooks, and Winthrop's all-time leading scorer, Keon Johnson. Kelsey's program signed D2 transfer Chandler Vaudrin, the then college national leader in triple-doubles and D. J. Burns., an ESPN 4-star recruit and transfer from the University of Tennessee. In March 2021, Kelsey left Winthrop to become the head coach at the College of Charleston.\nMark Prosser era (2021–present).\nIn April 2021, Mark Prosser, former Winthrop assistant and son of Skip Prosser, returned to take the head coach position vacated by Pat Kelsey. Six games into his first season, the Eagles beat the University of Washington to notch Prosser's first win as head coach at WU against a Power 5 conference and Winthrop's first win ever against a PAC-12 team. Additionally, the 2021-2022 team went undefeated at home (13-0) and finished first in the South Division.\n2007 Season: Top 25 and Round of 32.\nWinthrop's greatest success to date was in 2007, as it went 29–5 under Coach Marshall and finished #22 nationally in both the AP and Coaches' Final Polls. The Eagles posted a perfect 14–0 mark in conference play, winning the Big South regular season championship. Notable regular season non-conference victories included wins against Mississippi State and Old Dominion. Each of Winthrop's four regular season losses came at the hand of a Top 25 opponent, with two of the games decided by single-digit margins. They lost to the #2 program in the country (UNC) by seven points.\nAfter winning the Big South Tournament, the Eagles were given a #11 seed in the NCAA Tournament and a First Round matchup against #6 seed Notre Dame. On March 16, 2007 (day before St. Patrick's Day), Winthrop defeated the Irish by a score of 74–64, becoming the first Big South men's basketball team to win an NCAA Tournament First Round game. In the Round of 32, the Eagles lost to #3 seed Oregon by a score of 75–61 to close out their season.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nWinthrop has appeared in 11 NCAA Tournaments and has a combined record of 1–11. The Eagles advanced to the Round of 32 in 2007, the only Big South team ever to do so.\nFacilities.\nWinthrop Coliseum (1982–present): 6,100-seat multi-purpose arena in Rock Hill, South Carolina."

It was only the third successful defense of a Masters title, previously accomplished in 1966 by Jack Nicklaus and 1990 by Nick Faldo.\nField.\nTommy Aaron, Seve Ballesteros, Charles Coody, Fred Couples, Ben Crenshaw, Nick Faldo, Raymond Floyd, Bernhard Langer (10,13,14,16,17), Sandy Lyle, Larry Mize, José María Olazábal (10,16,17), Mark O'Meara (3), Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Vijay Singh (4,11,14,16,17), Craig Stadler, Tom Watson, Tiger Woods (2,3,4,5,14,16,17), Ian Woosnam (13), Fuzzy Zoeller\nErnie Els (10,13,14,16,17), Retief Goosen (16,17), Lee Janzen\nDavid Duval (10,14,16,17), Paul Lawrie, Justin Leonard (14,16,17)\nDavis Love III (11,14,16,17), David Toms (14,16,17)\nCraig Perks\nBubba Dickerson (a), Robert Hamilton (a)\nMichael Hoey (a)\nChez Reavie (a)\nTim Jackson (a)\nPaul Azinger (11,14,16,17), Ángel Cabrera (11,16,17), Mark Calcavecchia (12,14,16,17), Chris DiMarco (14,15,16,17), Brad Faxon (14,15,16,17), Jim Furyk (14,16,17), Toshimitsu Izawa (16,17), Miguel Ángel Jiménez (13), Rocco Mediate (11,14,16,17), Phil Mickelson (11,12,14,16,17), Steve Stricker (14,16), Kirk Triplett (11,14,16,17)\nMark Brooks, Stewart Cink (14,16,17), Tom Kite\nShingo Katayama (16,17), Steve Lowery (14,16)\nDarren Clarke (16,17), Niclas Fasth (16,17), Billy Mayfair (14)\nRobert Allenby (16,17), Billy Andrade, José Cóceres (16,17), Joe Durant (16,17), Bob Estes (16,17), Sergio García (16,17), Scott Hoch (16,17), Jerry Kelly (17), Tom Lehman (16,17), Frank Lickliter (16), Shigeki Maruyama, Scott McCarron (17), Jesper Parnevik (16,17), Tom Pernice Jr., Kenny Perry (16,17), Jeff Sluman, Kevin Sutherland (15,17), Scott Verplank (16,17), Mike Weir (16,17)\nStuart Appleby, Thomas Bjørn (17), Michael Campbell (17), Pádraig Harrington (17), Charles Howell III (17), Paul McGinley (17), Colin Montgomerie (17), Nick Price (17), Adam Scott, Toru Taniguchi, Lee Westwood (17)\nJohn Daly, Matt Kuchar, Rory Sabbatini\nGreg Norman\nAll the amateurs except Tim Jackson were playing in their first Masters, as were Niclas Fasth, Charles Howell III, Jerry Kelly, Paul McGinley, Craig Perks, Adam Scott, Kevin Sutherland, and Toru Taniguchi.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, April 11, 2002\"\nDavis Love III, the 1997 PGA Championship winner, rolled out to the first round lead with a five-under 67. Sergio García who had little success prior to this year at the Masters, shot a four-under 68 to place him in a tie for second with Ángel Cabrera. 2001 U.S. Open champion, Retief Goosen, shot a three-under 69 to place him in a tie with Phil Mickelson and Pádraig Harrington for fourth. There was a massive eleven-way tie at -2 for seventh after the first round. Most notably in this group was two-time and defending Masters champion, Tiger Woods. This group saw two other Masters champions in Vijay Singh and José María Olazábal. Four others were in red figures at -1 with Greg Norman headlining that group.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, April 12, 2002\"\n\"Saturday, April 13, 2002\"\nVijay Singh, the 2000 champion, headlined the second round with a dominant, seven-under 65 to bolt up to the top of the leaderboard at −9. The Fijian was not the only impressive player on the day, as four players shot five-under 67s, including Retief Goosen who moved into second at −8 and Ernie Els who moved into third at −7. Three-time Masters champion, Nick Faldo, also was among those who posted a 67. Tiger Woods headlined the five players tied for fourth at −5. Woods shot a three-under 69 to place him four strokes off the lead heading to the weekend. Also in this group was two-time champion José María Olazábal. Phil Mickelson was among the four players tied for ninth at −3. Because of the good deal of low scoring, the cut was set at +3, and Jim Furyk and David Duval headlined the list of notables to fail to make the weekend. Second round play was suspended due to weather and 38 golfers had to complete it Saturday morning.\nAmateurs: Hoey (+4), Dickerson (+6), Hamilton (+10), Jackson (+10), Reavie (+16).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, April 13, 2002\"\nThe defending champion, Tiger Woods, charged to a tie for the lead with a six-under 66 to move to -11. Woods, looking for his seventh major championship, was 6-0 going into the final round of a major championship with at least a share of the lead. South African Retief Goosen shot a three-under 69 to move from second place at the beginning of the day to a tie with Woods for the 54-hole lead. Vijay Singh shot a disappointing par 72 after his 65 in the second round to remain at -9 and in third place all by himself. Phil Mickelson charged up the leaderboard with a four-under 68 into a tie for fourth with Ernie Els and Sergio García. José María Olazábal shot a one-under 71 to move to -6 and sole ownership of seventh place. Two Europeans (Pádraig Harrington, Thomas Bjørn) sat six shots behind the lead in a tie for eighth at -5. Because the second round had to be completed Saturday morning, third round play began with golfers teeing off from the 1st and 10th holes to ensure the round would be completed by night fall.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, April 14, 2002\"\nSummary.\nFor the first time since Nick Faldo in 1990, a defending Masters champion successfully defended his title. Tiger Woods captured his third green jacket and seventh overall major championship with a one-under 71 to complete his tournament at -12. This was only the third time in Masters history that a player won back-to-back titles (Jack Nicklaus 1965–66, Faldo 1989–90). Woods set yet another Masters record for the best score by a golfer defending his championship.\nWoods was not threatened during the final round as his 54-hole co-leader, Retief Goosen, shot a two-over 74 to fall to -9 and a second-place finish. Phil Mickelson, José María Olazábal, and Pádraig Harrington all shot one-under 71s to finish third, fourth, and tied for fifth respectively. Ernie Els and Vijay Singh spoiled great first and second rounds with scores over par in the final round. Els shot a one-over 73 to tie for fifth, and Singh shot a four-over 76 to finish in seventh. Sergio García had his best Masters finish in eighth place at -4. Overall, the scoring was much more difficult during the final round than it was in the other three rounds. The only score below 70 was by Shigeki Maruyama, who shot a five-under 67 to finish -1 for the tournament and a tie for 14th place.\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\""

        "title": "2007–08 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2007–08 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team was an NCAA Division I college basketball team competing in the Big East Conference representing Georgetown University. The team finished with a regular-season record of 27–5, and won the conference regular-season title on March 8, 2008, the first time Georgetown won the Big East regular-season championship in consecutive years and the only time in the original Big East of 1979–2013. It lost to Pittsburgh in the Big East tournament championship game. It was a number-two seed in the 2008 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, where it lost its second-round game to Davidson in a major upset. The team was ranked No. 11 in the final Associated Press Poll of the season and No. 12 in the postseason Coaches' Poll.\nSeason recap.\nRegular season.\nNon-conference schedule.\nDuring the previous season, the Hoyas won both the Big East regular season championship and Big East tournament championship and advanced all the way to the Final Four in the 2007 NCA tournament, all for the first time for a Georgetown team since 1989. With four returning starters – senior center Roy Hibbert, senior point guard Jonathan Wallace, sophomore forward DaJuan Summers, and junior guard Jessie Sapp – Georgetown entered the 2007–08 season ranked No. 5, the Hoyas′ highest preseason ranking since 1995, even though 2007 Big East Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year forward Jeff Green had left Georgetown during the offseason to enter the National Basketball Association draft, foregoing his senior year. With Green gone, Hibbert became the centerpiece of Georgetown's offense.\nGeorgetown opened the season with eight straight victories, the first time the Hoyas had opened a season 5–0 or better since 2003. The third game, at Ball State, had been scheduled as a rematch between John Thompson III and his younger brother, Ball State head coach and former Georgetown player Ronny Thompson, whose teams had played one another a year earlier at the Verizon Center in the brothers′ first meeting as head coaches, but Ronny Thompson had left Ball State during the summer of 2007, and John Thompson III faced a Ball State team coached by Bill Taylor instead. The seventh game was against Jacksonville, the first meeting between the teams since a December 1969 game that was declared a \"no contest\" after Georgetown head coach John Magee pulled his players off the court at Jacksonville out of fear for their safety in the face of a hostile crowd; 38 years later, the result of the meeting was an easy 87-55 Hoya victory. During the winning streak, Hibbert had 23 points and eight rebounds in a come-from-behind win against William and Mary, 12 points against Michigan in a game that began with Georgetown pulling out to a 43–19 lead, 16 points and seven rebounds against Ball State, his first double-double of the season (14 points and 10 rebounds) in 24 minutes of play at Old Dominion, and 14 points, nine rebounds, and five blocked shots against Alabama. Over the same stretch, Jonathan Wallace had 15 points against William &amp; Mary, 13 points against Fairfield, and 11 points against Alabama, while Jessie Sapp scored 18 points against William &amp; Mary and 12 points each against Michigan and Alabama. DaJuan Summers had 10 points against William &amp; Mary, 16 points against Fairfield, 18 points against Alabama, and 14 against Jacksonville. Freshman guards Chris Wright and Austin Freeman also showed their potential as their college careers began: Wright scored 10 points against Michigan and 14 against Jacksonville, while Freeman had 10 points against Michigan, 11 points at Old Dominion, 15 against Jacksonville, and 21 points in a very physical 110-51 blow-out of Radford in which Georgetown shot 65 percent from the field for the game and 71 percent in the second half, scoring 100 or more points for the first time since John Thompson III became head coach in 2004. Sophomore guard Jeremiah Rivers came off the bench to have an outstanding defensive performance and five assists in the Fairfield game.\nAfter opening 8–0, Georgetown faced its first ranked opponent of the season on December 22, visiting No. 2 Memphis, the winner of 36 straight home games. The Hoyas led by as many as eight points in the first half – the last time was 35–27 with 4:40 left in the half – but the Tigers then began to make shots more consistently and came back to take a 41–40 lead with 40 seconds left in the first half and a 43–40 lead at halftime. In the second half, Memphis missed 11 of its first 12 shots and Georgetown took a 46–45 lead with 15:40 left in the game, but the Tigers, who dominated Georgetown in second-half rebounds, then went on a 9–0 run to lead 54–46 with 12:18 left. After that, Memphis's lead stretched to double digits and reached 17 twice, with the Tigers making 17 of their 22 free throws in the second half and four Tigers scoring in double digits during the game. For Georgetown, Austin Freeman had a team-high 14 points, DaJuan Summers scored 13, and Patrick Ewing Jr., contributed 10, but Roy Hibbert only managed a season-low six points. Memphis outrebounded Georgetown 43–30 – a season low for the Hoyas – and won the game 85–71 to drop Georgetown to 8–1 on the year.\nThe Hoyas finished 2007 and their nonconference schedule with wins over American – the first meeting between the crosstown rivals since December 1986 – and Fordham. American held a luncheon before its game with Georgetown, now ranked No. 8, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Eagles′ December 15, 1982, upset win over the then-No. 5 1982-83 Hoyas in December 1982 – touted as the biggest win in American's basketball history – but Georgetown dominated the Eagles this time around and won 78–51, with DaJuan Summers scoring 16 points, Chris Wright 13, and Hibbert 14, although Hibbert tied his career-low total of one rebound, the first time he had only one rebound since a game against South Florida in January 2006. The game against Fordham on New Year's Eve was the first meeting of the teams since January 1979, and the Hoyas, who had climbed to No. 7 in the Associated Press Poll that day, routed the Rams with Jonathan Wallace scoring a team-high 19 points, DaJuan Summers scoring 15 and grabbing nine rebounds, Austin Freeman contributing 12 points, and Jessie Sapp and Roy Hibbert adding 11 each. During the Fordham game, Wallace reached two career benchmarks, becoming the 39th Hoya to score 1,000 points in his career and scoring his 190th three-point shot, moving ahead of Kevin Braswell′s team record of 189 three-pointers set between 1988 and 1992.\nConference schedule.\nGeorgetown extended its winning streak to five – opening 3–0 in conference play – as it began the Big East season in the new year of 2008 as the best team in the country in points allowed, with opponents averaging only 55.2 points per game, and in field goal percentage defense, with opponents shooting only 35.2 percent from the field against the Hoyas. The season opener saw the Hoyas beat Rutgers for the sixth time in a row and seventh time in eight games, with Austin Freeman scoring 13 points, Jonathan Wallace 11, and DaJuan Summers and Jessie Sapp 10 each. Against DePaul, Roy Hibbert had a double-double (17 points and 11 rebounds) and five assists, while Freeman scored 13 points and Jonathan Wallace and Jessie Sapp had 12 each. Four days later in a back-and-forth game against Connecticut, Hibbert had a 20-point, eight-rebound performance that he capped off with a rare three-pointer – making him 2-for-2 in three-pointers during his Georgetown career – with less than five seconds left in the game. It turned out to be the game-winning shot in a 72–69 victory, giving the Hoyas two consecutive wins over the Huskies for the first time since a six-game Hoya winning streak from 1991 to 1993. Patrick Ewing Jr., scored 14 points against Connecticut.\nEntering the game as the best-shooting team from the field in the country at 51.6 percent, the Hoyas went on the road to face their first ranked Big East opponent, No. 15 Pittsburgh, winners of 12 straight games on their home court, on January 14. Ronald Ramón and Keith Benjamin came off the bench to replace injured starters Levance Fields and Mike Cook and scored 18 points each for the Panthers, while Pittsburgh freshman center DeJuan Blair, 7 inches (18 cm) shorter than Roy Hibbert, matched up well against Hibbert, scoring 15 points and grabbing nine rebounds, and the Panthers outrebounded the Hoyas 37–33. Although Hibbert scored 12 points, Jonathan Wallace scored 14, and Vernon Macklin contributed 10, the Hoyas shot only 44.2 percent from the field and 3-for-20 (15 percent) from three-point range and never led during the game; they began the second half behind only 27–26, but Pittsburgh started the second half with a 15–4 run to take a 42–30 lead. Georgetown scored eight consecutive points to close to 47–44 with 9:05 left in the game, but the Panthers responded by scoring six points of their own to stretch their led back to 52–44 with 8:14 left. Pittsburgh went on to upset Georgetown, 69–60, to break the Hoyas's five-game winning streak and drop Georgetown to 13–2 for the year and 3–1 in the Big East.\nFollowing the setback against Pittsburgh, the Hoyas – with their defense ranked second in the country in opponents′ shooting percentage, allowing opponents to shoot only 35.8 percent from the field, and sixth in points allowed, with opponents averaging only 56.7 points per game – began another winning streak that ultimately reached six games. By the time they entered the fourth game of the streak, facing St. John's at Madison Square Garden on January 30, they ranked first in the country in opponents′ shooting percentage at 35.8 percent and fifth in points allowed at 57.5, and they handed St. John's a defeat that tied its worst Big East loss in history, a 74–42 rout – equaled only by a 72–42 loss, also at the hands of the Hoyas, on January 6, 1982 – in which the Red Storm shot only 21.3 percent from the field and Georgetown led 41–14 at halftime and opened the second half with a 12–0 run to make the lead 53–14. During the streak, Hibbert had 21 points and five assists against Notre Dame, 15 points in a close overtime victory over Syracuse, a double-double (12 points and 10 rebounds) in a narrow, come-from-behind win at West Virginia, 11 points in the blow-out of St. John's, 16 points and nine rebounds against Seton Hall, and 13 points and eight rebounds in a hard-fought, come-from-behind win over South Florida. Jonathan Wallace had 15 points against Syracuse, while DaJuan Summers had a double-double (17 points and a career-high 11 rebounds) against Notre Dame, and a career-best 24 points against South Florida. Jessie Sapp scored 15 points against West Virginia, 10 points against St. John's, and 17 points against Seton Hall, and Patrick Ewing Jr., contributed a career-high 16 points against Seton Hall. Austin Freeman scored 16 points against Notre Dame, while Vernon Macklin had a career-high and game-high 18 points against St. John's,\nThe Hoyas were ranked No. 6 and sported a 19–2 overall record and a conference record of 9–1 when they visited Louisville on February 9. With strong defensive performances on both sides, the Cardinals broke the Hoyas′ winning streak, dominating the Hoyas in the second half to come from behind for an upset victory in which both Roy Hibbert and Austin Freeman scored 14 points. Georgetown bounced back to beat Villanova 55-53 two days later, with Jonathan Wallace sinking two free throws with a tenth of a second left to give him 15 points and Georgetown its first home win against the Wildcats since January 27, 1997. Roy Hibbert had 13 and DaJuan Summers 12 points against Villanova. Ranked No. 8 and visiting Syracuse five days later for the second game of the season against the Orange, Georgetown suffered another setback, falling 21 points behind in the first half and losing 77–70 despite a career-high 26 points from Jonathan Wallace, a 14-point performance for DaJuan Summers, and 11 points each by Roy Hibbert and Jessie Sapp.\nThe 1-2 stretch caused the Hoyas to drop to No. 12 in the AP Poll, but they closed out the regular season with five straight wins. Hibbert scored 18 points and had eight rebounds and Wallace contributed 14 points against Providence on February 18; in a rout of Cincinnati five days later that stretched the Hoyas winning streak at the Verizon Center to 19 games and put them a half-game ahead of Louisville to take first place in the Big East, Jessie Sapp had a game-high 16 points, Austin Freeman scored 13, and Hibbert had 12 points and five blocked shots; and in a rematch against St. John's on February 27 that stretched the Verizon Center winning streak to 20, Summers scored 21 points on strong three-point shooting and Hibbert had 17 points.\nThe Hoyas topped off the five-game streak with back-to-back wins over ranked opponents. Ranked No. 11 and tied with Louisville for first place in the conference, Georgetown visited No. 21 Marquette on March 1. Marquette led 32–28 at halftime and went on a 13–2 run to take an 11-point lead with 12 minutes left in the game. Georgetown closed the gap, and with 2.8 seconds left in regulation and the Hoyas behind 63–60, Golden Eagles point guard Dominic James fouled Jonathan Wallace on a three-point attempt, Wallace sank all three free throws to tie the game and force overtime, and Georgetown then outscored Marquette to win 70–68, with Wallace and Hibbert finishing the game with 20 points each. A week later, ranked No. 11, Georgetown finished the regular season with a rematch with No. 12 Louisville. Although the Cardinals tied their season high with 14 steals, they shot only 4-for-18 (22 percent) from three-point range and 10-for-18 (55.6 percent) in free throws. DaJuan Summers took only one shot in the second half, but that was a three-pointer that put Georgetown ahead 55–52 with 40 seconds remaining. It turned out to be the winning shot and final score, as Louisville missed three straight three-point attempts to end the game. Austin Freeman had 15 points and Roy Hibbert, playing the final home game of his college career, had a 12-point, eight-rebound performance.\nWith the regular-season-ending victory over Louisville, No. 11 Georgetown finished with an overall record of 25-4 and a Big East record of 15–3, and repeated as Big East regular-season champion for the first time in history. It was only the second time in history and the first time since 1988 that the Big East regular-season title was determined in a game between teams tied for first place entering the season's final day.\nBig East tournament.\nWith a No. 1 seed in the Big East tournament for the second year in a row and a No.9 national ranking, Georgetown had a bye in the first round. In the quarterfinals, the Hoyas faced eighth seed Villanova, also for the second year in a row. Villanova, a heavy underdog, fell behind 34–19 with 3:58 left in the first half, but over the rest of the first half and into the second half the Wildcats went on a 28–9 run to that gave them the lead, 47–43, with 13:06 left in the game. Georgetown took the lead back at 51–50 with 12:04 left in the game and pulled away to an 82–63 victory. Although Villanova shot 23-for-28 (82.1 percent) from the free-throw line and Roy Hibbert did not score during the game and had only four rebounds before fouling out with 5:09 to play, Georgetown made up for it by setting both a Big East tournament record and a school record by connecting on 17 three-point shots during the game, shooting 17-for-28 (60.7 percent) from three-point range. Jessie Sapp hit on six three-point shots and scored a career-high 23 points, Jonathan Wallace had five three-pointers and 20 points, and DaJuan Summers had 19 points and three three-pointers.\nIn a semifinal game the next day, Georgetown faced fifth seed West Virginia. The Hoyas staked themselves to a 33–21 lead at halftime and Jonathan Wallace hit a three-point jumper 54 seconds into the second half to stretch the lead to 36–21. But then the Mountaineers scored on 10 straight possessions to close to 49–45 with 12:16 remaining. After that, however, the Hoyas began to pull away steadily, winning 72–55. Roy Hibbert returned to form with a double-double (25 points and 13 rebounds, both season highs) including the third three-pointer of his career, making him a perfect 3-for-3 in career three-pointers, while Jessie Sapp scored 13 points and had seven rebounds.\nGeorgetown advanced to the Big East tournament final for the second year in a row – its first back-to-back appearances in the final since 1991 and 1992 – to face No. 17 Pittsburgh, the tournament's seventh seed, with a chance to repeat as tournament champions for the first time since 1984 and 1985. Although they shot only 22-for-44 (50 percent) from the free-throw line, the Panthers outrebounded the Hoyas 41-29 and attacked the net with a balanced offense. Pittsburgh led 31–28 at halftime and 59–49 with 3:45 remaining in the game. Georgetown closed to a 65–60 deficit with 1:20 left to play, but Pittsburgh's Ronald Ramón went 5-for-6 from the free-throw line over the last 1:07 and Pittsburgh took the tournament championship with a 74–65 upset victory. It was the first defeat for the Hoyas in the 16 Big East tournament games they had played in as the tournament's top seed since the tournament began in 1980. Roy Hibbert had 17 points in his final Big East game, and Jonathan Wallace had 12.\nNCAA tournament.\nWith a 27–5 record and ranked No. 8 in the country, Georgetown received an at-large bid to the 2008 NCAA tournament, its third consecutive NCAA tournament appearance. Seeded second in the Midwest Regional, the Hoyas began their pursuit of their first back-to-back Final Four appearances since 1984 and 1985 by facing 15th-seeded Maryland-Baltimore County (UMBC) in the first round. The Hoyas dominated the undersized Retrievers, shooting 51 percent from the field and holding UMBC to 32-percent shooting and completely scoreless over a seven-minute stretch in the first half, during which the Retrievers missed eight straight shots: A Chris Wright three-point jumper gave the Hoyas a 31–17 lead with three minutes left in the half before UMBC's scoring drought ended. Georgetown went on a 22–5 run late in the first half, posted a 34–22 halftime lead, and won 66–47. Roy Hibbert exhibited thorough control inside and had 13 points, Jonathan Wallace also had 13, Austin Freeman contributed 11, and Patrick Ewing Jr., who filled in at center when Hibbert was on the bench, finished with 10 points.\nIn the second round, Georgetown met the region's tenth seed, No. 23 Davidson, the winner of 23 straight games, led by junior point guard Stephen Curry, a future National Basketball Association star. Before defeating Gonzaga in the first round two days earlier, Davidson had not won an NCAA tournament game in 39 years, but when asked about the match-up with Davidson after the win over UMBC, John Thompson III said, \"Watching Davidson makes me feel worried...At this point, you just need to figure out how to get a win and move on.\" Despite Thompson's qualms, heavily favored Georgetown seemed to have the game under control in the first half: After a 2–0 Davidson lead, the Hoyas – featuring the country's top defense entering the game, allowing opponents to shoot only 37 percent from the field and allowing an average of only 57.6 points per game – built a 38–27 lead by halftime. Shooting 71 percent from the floor early in the second half and with Curry missing 10 of his first 12 shots of the game, Georgetown extended the lead to 46–29 with 17:56 left to play. But then Curry came alive, and the entire character of the game changed. Led by Curry, Davidson went on a 16–2 run that cut Georgetown's lead to 50–48 with 8:47 left to play. Thanks largely to Curry, for whom the Hoyas suddenly had no answer, the Wildcats went on to take a 60–58 lead – their first lead since 2-0 – with 4:40 left, and Curry then scored a three-pointer and a two-pointer to stretch the lead to 65–60. Curry made six of his last nine shots from the field and five of six free throws in the final 23 seconds and scored 30 points – 25 of them in the second half – and Davidson upset Georgetown 74–70 to extend its winning streak, the longest active streak in the country at the time, to 24 games and bring Georgetown's season to a stunning end. The Hoyas shot 63 percent from the field as a team – Jessie Sapp scored 14 points, Jonathan Wallace had 12, and DaJuan Summers finished with 10 – but Roy Hibbert managed only six points and a single rebound and Georgetown committed 20 turnovers. The loss to Davidson was the first in what became a pattern of upsets in, and early exits from, the NCAA tournament over the next several years.\nFor the season, Roy Hibbert shot 60.9 percent from the field and finished with 13.5 points per game, while Jonathan Wallace shot 49.4 percent from the field overall and 44.7 percent from three-point range, averaging 10.7 points per game. DaJuan Summers shot 42.9 percent and averaged 11.1 points per game, and Jessie Sapp shot 43.9 percent and averaged 9.7 points per game, while Patrick Ewing. Jr., shot 52.9 percent from the field, averaging 6.1 percent from the field.\nAt the end of the school year, a major turnover took place in the roster. Hibbert, Ewing, Wallace, and Tyler Crawford all graduated. The Toronto Raptors drafted Hibbert in the 2008 NBA draft and subsequently traded the rights to him to the Indiana Pacers, with whom he began his NBA career. The Sacramento Kings drafted Ewing in the same draft. Wallace went undrafted in 2008, but played in the NBA Summer League, the NBA Developmental League, Europe, and Angola from 2008 to 2016, when he returned to Georgetown as a special assistant coach under John Thompson III. Sophomore center Vernon Macklin decided in late April to leave the team in search of greater playing time, announcing in May that he would transfer to Florida; he sat out the 2008–09 season, then started 71 games for Florida between 2009 and 2011 and was selected by the Detroit Pistons in the 2011 NBA draft. Sophomore guard Jeremiah Rivers also departed, transferring to Indiana, where he believed he had a better chance of showcasing his talents than he could in Georgetown's \"Princeton offense.\"\nGeorgetown finished the season with a record of 28–6, and its .824 winning percentage was its best since 1995-96. Postseason, the Hoyas were ranked No. 11 in the Associated Press Poll and No. 12 in the Coaches Poll for the year.\nRoster.\nSource\nRankings.\nSource\n2007-08 schedule and results.\nSource\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:#8D817B;\"| NCAA tournament"

        "text": "The Notre Dame Fighting Irish Men's Basketball team is the intercollegiate men's basketball program representing the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana, United States. The program competes in the Atlantic Coast Conference of NCAA Division I. On September 12, 2012, Notre Dame announced they would be moving to the Atlantic Coast Conference; they joined the conference on July 1, 2013.\nThe school holds two retroactively awarded national championships in basketball from the Helms Foundation: for the 1927 (19–1 overall record) and 1936 (22–2–1 overall record) seasons. They have also played in the NCAA tournament 36 times, good for 9th all time, and reached the Final Four in 1978. The Irish hold the record for most Tournament appearances without a championship or championship game appearance, one of five teams (along with Texas, Temple, Illinois and Oklahoma) to have 30 or more appearances without a title and one of three teams (along with Texas and Temple) to have more than 30 appearances without either. They are also the first Big East team to go undefeated at home two straight seasons.\nThe Fighting Irish play their home games in the Purcell Pavilion at the Edmund P. Joyce Center. Since moving to the Purcell Pavilion in 1968, they have had 44 winning seasons at the Purcell Pavilion, including 5 undefeated seasons at home (1973, 1985, 2006, 2007, and 2010) and have had only 4 losing seasons at the Purcell Pavilion (1971, 1981, 1992, and 1995). Jeff Sagarin and ESPN listed the program 12th in the college basketball all-time rankings in the \"ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia\". The Fighting Irish are currently coached by Micah Shrewsberry.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Fighting Irish have appeared in the NCAA tournament 37 times.\nNCAA tournament seeding history.\n\"The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\"\nBest Single-Game Scoring Performances\nNIT results.\nThe Fighting Irish have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 12 times. Their combined record is 27–12.\nAccomplishments.\nNational Championships.\nThe Irish were awarded two Helms Athletic Foundation National Championships.\nUpsets of Number 1's and unbeatens.\nThe wins include several wins over the defending NCAA Tournament Champion. Both wins over UCLA were in seasons immediately following UCLA claiming the NCAA Championship with the 1971 win coming over a team that would be the eventual tournament champion. The 1954 win in the NCAA tournament over Indiana prevented IU from back-to-back national titles after claiming the 1953 NCAA Tournament Title. The 1978 win over Marquette was another instance of the Irish defeating the defending national champion. The 1948 win over Kentucky saw the Irish defeat the eventual Tournament champion who would go on to win both the 1948 and 1949 titles. The 1948 win over NYU was a victory over the eventual NIT runner-up, in a time where the prestige of the NIT tournament rivaled that of the NCAA tournament.\nAlso of note is that the 2005 win over Boston College and the 2012 win over Syracuse saw 20–0 teams traveling to South Bend and leaving with their first loss of the season. Boston College, in its final year as a member of the Big East, set the record for most consecutive wins by a Big East team to start a season. The 2012 Syracuse team began the game against the Irish with the goal of breaking Boston College's record. As in 2005, the Irish defeated Syracuse and cemented their place as the streak stopper.\nCoaches.\nCurrent coaching staff.\nThe current coaching staff is as follows.\nCoaching awards.\nNational Coach of the Year\nSkip Prosser Man of the Year Award\nBig East Coach of the Year\nNational Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) District V Coach of the Year\nPlayers.\nNational Players of the Year\nNational Freshman of the Year\nConsensus All-Americans\nNotre Dame leads all schools with 3 of the 18 total 3-time Consensus All-American selections.\nJohn Wooden All-Americans\nBig East Player of the Year\nBig East Rookie of the Year\nBig East Most Improved Player\nNIT MVP\n\"For a complete list of yearly all-Americans, see:\" 2007–08 Notre Dame Men's Basketball Media Guide pages 176–179 (PDF copy available at 2007–08 Men's Basketball Guide)"

        "title": "Black participation in college basketball",
        "text": "Black people have been participating in American college basketball for over a century.\nIntroduction at Howard.\nThirteen years after basketball was invented, and after being exposed to the game over the summer at Harvard University, Coach Edwin Henderson introduced basketball to a physical education class at Howard University in Washington, D. C. By 1910, basketball was one of the most popular sports among young African-Americans. The game could be played on almost any surface, and it required little equipment. It was promoted largely in YMCAs in black neighborhoods, on basketball courts indoors and outdoors, at parks and on playgrounds.\nBy 1915, African-Americans played basketball in high school physical education classes, on college and university squads, and on club teams representing major urban cities. Some of the first predominantly black universities to form basketball teams include Hampton University in Virginia; Lincoln University in Pennsylvania; Wilberforce University in Ohio; and Virginia Union in Richmond. In 1916, the all-black Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) was formed, uniting Virginia Union, Shaw University (Raleigh, North Carolina), Lincoln and Howard in competition.\nFour years later, the all-black Southeastern Athletic Conference was established, and by 1928 there were four all-black regional conferences.\nCollegiate play.\nAt the college level, African-American athletes such as Paul Robeson at Rutgers University, Wilbur Wood at Nebraska, Fenwick Watkins at the University of Vermont and Cumberland Posey at Penn State and Duquesne became basketball stars before World War I in white major-college programs.\nGeorge Gregory, Jr., the 6'-4\" captain and center of the Columbia University team from 1928–1931, became the first African American all-American college basketball player, in 1931.\nBig Dave DeJernett, the 6–4 captain and center of integrated Indiana Central University, which won the mythical Indiana college conference championship with a 16–1 record in 1934 (Notre Dame and Purdue finishing 2nd and 3rd), became the first Afro-American four-year collegiate star to sign with a top-level professional contender when he agreed to play for the New York Rens in 1936.\nSeveral black college basketball programs stood out. Xavier University of Louisiana won 67 games and lost only two between 1934 and 1938, and Alabama State University, Lincoln University in Missouri, Morgan State University in Maryland and Wiley College in Texas all produced exceptional basketball programs.\nFrom the 1920s until 1947, few African-American players were allowed in major college programs. One notable exception was Jackie Robinson, a multi-sport star (1939–1941) at UCLA just before World War II, who went on to greater fame for breaking Major League Baseball's 20th-century color line. Robinson's honors at UCLA were impressive: for two years highest scorer in basketball competition in the Pacific Coast Conference, national champion long (then \"broad\") jumper, the school's first athlete to letter in four sports, All-American football halfback and varsity baseball shortstop. He left UCLA in 1941 because of financial pressures, not many credits away from a bachelor's degree. UCLA also had Don Barksdale, the first African-American consensus all-American basketball player in 1947. Barksdale would later be the first African-American to win an Olympic basketball gold medal (1948), a Pan-American basketball gold medal (1951), and would be the third African-American to sign an NBA contract after Chuck Cooper joined Boston and Earl Lloyd signed with Washington. He was the first African-American to play in the NBA All-Star Game.\nIn 1947, William Garrett integrated big-time college basketball by joining the basketball program at Indiana University. He broke the gentlemen's agreement that had barred black players from the Big Ten Conference, at that time college basketball's most important conference. While enduring taunts from opponents and pervasive segregation at home and on the road, Garrett became the best player Indiana had ever had, an all-American, and, in 1951, the third African-American drafted in the NBA. Within a year of his graduation from IU, there were six African-American basketball players on Big Ten teams.\nDespite the examples set by DeJernett, the first Indiana Mr. Basketball George Crowe, and other Hoosier hoops stars like Muncie's Jack Mann, Whiteland's Ray Crowe, and Anderson's Jumpin' Johnny Wilson (not to mention Davage Minor and Chuck Harmon), Indiana was an unlikely place for a civil rights breakthrough. It was stone-cold isolationist, widely segregated and hostile to change. But in the late 1940s, Indiana had a leader of the largest black YMCA in the world, which viewed sports as a wedge for broader integration; a visionary university president, who believed his institution belonged to all citizens of the state; a passion for high school and college basketball; and a teenager who was, as nearly as any civil rights pioneer has ever been, the perfect person for his time and role. Slowly from there, Division I college basketball became integrated.\nIntegration.\nThe 1947–48 Indiana State Teacher's College (now Indiana State University) team, coached by John Wooden, was responsible for integrating post-season collegiate basketball tournaments.\nThe 1946–47 Sycamores won the Indiana Intercollegiate Conference title and received an invitation to the National Association for Intercollegiate Basketball tournament. Wooden refused the invitation, citing the NAIB's policy banning African American players. One of Wooden's players was Clarence Walker, an African-American from East Chicago, Indiana.\nThe following season (1947–48), Coach Wooden again led Indiana State to the conference title. The NAIB had reversed its policy banning African-American players that year; with the support of the NAACP and Walker's parents, Wooden and Indiana State accepted the invitation and led the Sycamores to the NAIB National Tournament final, losing to Louisville. That year, Walker became the first African-American to play in any post-season intercollegiate basketball tournament, coming off the bench and scoring eight points.\nThe lifting of the ban on black players also meant the NAIB champion would be eligible for an automatic berth in the 1948 Olympic Trials. The higher-profile NIT and NCAA tournaments finally integrated two years later.\nThe University of San Francisco Dons men's basketball team coached by Phil Woolpert was the first team with three black starters to win the NCAA championship in 1955. They were led by black future Hall of Famers Bill Russell and KC Jones and supported by a third black starter Hal Perry. The following year 1956 they went undefeated (29–0) and again won the NCAA championship even though KC Jones was declared ineligible for the NCAA tournament. Black sixth man Eugene Brown replaced Jones for the tournament run. \nThe Loyola University (Chicago) teams of the early 1960s, coached by George Ireland, are thought to be responsible for ushering in a new era of racial equality in the sport by shattering a major color barrier in NCAA men's basketball. Beginning in 1961, Loyola broke the longstanding gentlemen's agreement not to play more than three black players at any given time, putting as many as four black players on the court at every game. For the 1962–63 season, Ireland's Loyola team played four black starters in every game. That season, Loyola also became the first team in NCAA Division I history to play an all-black lineup, doing so in a game against Wyoming in December 1962. \nIn 1963, Loyola shocked the nation and changed college basketball forever by starting four black players in the NCAA Tournament, as well as the Championship game. Loyola's stunning 60–58 overtime upset of two-time defending NCAA champion Cincinnati was the crowning achievement in the school's nearly decade-long struggle with racial inequality in men's college basketball, highlighted by the tumultuous events of that year's NCAA Tournament. Loyola's 1963 NCAA title was historic not only for the racial makeup of Loyola's team, but also because Cincinnati started three black players, making seven of the ten starters in the 1963 NCAA Championship game black. \nClem Haskins and Dwight Smith became the first black athletes to integrate the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball program in the Fall of 1963. This put Western Kentucky at the forefront to integrate college basketball in the Southeast.\nAnother memorable event for African Americans in college basketball came three years later in the 1966 NCAA championship game, in which Texas Western College (now University of Texas at El Paso) coach Don Haskins started five African-American players. The Miners beat favorite Kentucky 72–65 to win the 1966 NCAA title. The team's victory inspired the 2006 movie \"Glory Road\". The Hilltoppers were 2 points away from defeating Michigan and meeting Kentucky in the Mideast regional final of the 1966 NCAA tournament. A controversial foul called against Greg Smith during a jump ball put Cazzie Russell on the free throw line for Michigan, where he scored the tying and winning baskets.\nCoaching.\nIn 1967, Cleveland State hired John McLendon as the first African-American head coach of a major college basketball program.\nIn 1970, Illinois State hired Will Robinson as the second African-American head coach of a major college basketball program. \nIn 1984, John Thompson Jr. became the first African-American head coach to win the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship when the Georgetown Hoyas defeated the University of Houston 84–75. In 2007, his son, John Thompson III led the Hoyas to the Final Four becoming the first father-son coaching duo, regardless of race, to lead their respective teams to a Final Four appearance.\nDocumentary presentation.\nIn March 2008, ESPN broadcast a film titled \"Black Magic\", which is four-hour documentary that portrays the on- and off-court struggles of black basketball players at historically black colleges."

        "text": "Système U () was a French professional cycling team that existed from 1986 to 1988 and which cycled on and promoted Gitane racing bikes. In 1989 the team was renamed Super U–Raleigh–Fiat and rode Raleigh bicycles. Super U being a chain of supermarkets owned by the Système U group.\nHistory.\nA Système U team existed during the 1984 season (see Wolber–Spidel) with Marcel Boishardy as manager which was a continuation of the Wolber–Spidel team of the 1983 season. This team included riders such as Jean-René Bernaudeau and Colombian Martín Ramírez Ramírez. The sponsor Système U decided to take over the sponsorship of the highly successful Renault–Elf–Gitane team when Renault decided to retire from the peloton. \nRenault–Elf–Gitane which was directed by former French cycling champion Cyrille Guimard had dominated the Tour de France between 1978 and 1984. The 1986 season started well with Laurent Fignon winning the spring semi-classic La Flèche Wallonne and Thierry Marie winning the prologue of the 1986 Tour de France. \nMarie wore the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification for several days as the team also won the Team time trial of that year's Tour but the best for the general classification was the 10th place of French Champion Yvon Madiot. \nThe following year, the team achieved success with Charly Mottet who won the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré stage race and then wore the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification for several days in the 1987 Tour de France and finished fourth overall. The team won the team classification of that Tour. Mottet also won the Individual time trial classic at the end of the season, the Grand Prix des Nations. \nIn 1988, Fignon showed good form to win the Milan–San Remo Classic as well as the stage race the Tour de l'Avenir while Mottet won the Giro di Lombardia. In 1989, the team was renamed Super U after one of the supermarkets that the Système U cooperative owned and Gitane cycles stopped their long association with Guimard's team. Raleigh cycles took their place and became the second sponsor as well. \nThe year marked Fignon's return to form with a second win in Milan–San Remo, a win in the 1989 Giro d'Italia and the closest ever second place in the history of the Tour de France in the 1989 Tour de France. During this time Cyrille Guimard was the main directeur sportif with Bernard Quilfen and Jacques Cadicou being the other directeur sportifs. After Système U decided to withdraw sponsorship, Castorama a French retailer of DIY and home improvement supplies took over as main sponsor making the Castorama cycling team.\nNotable riders.\nRiders who have won a Grand Tour, held the leader's jersey of a Grand Tour, won a stage of a Grand Tour, won a classic or won a national championship. Their wins may have been at any time in their careers, not necessarily during their time in the Système U team:"

He also spent a period during his Saracens career, coaching boys from Merchant Taylors School. Dickens is currently the attacking coach at Leicester Tigers, he previously coached at Northampton, where he filled in as the head coach at the Saints following Jim Mallinder’s departure, and for .\nEarly life.\nDickens was born4 Feb 1976 in Knowsley, Merseyside. He trained to be a teacher, teaching at Chellaston Foundation School and Technology College and West Park Community School, Spondon after graduating from University College Worcester. \nFrom 6 years old he played at Derby Rugby Club and was playing regular first team in his late teens. \nHe first experienced rugby in England's national leagues playing for Stourbridge R.F.C. and then Manchester Rugby Club in National Division Two, for whom he appeared in all but one game in his final season with the club. In old he played faced the choice between pursuing a teaching career and one in professional rugby, opting for the latter and joining Guinness Premiership side Sale Sharks.\nPlaying career.\nSale Sharks 2001–02.\nDickens played for a single season at Sale Sharks in the 2001–02 season. He largely filled the role of understudy to Scottish international Bryan Redpath but still accumulated 18 first team appearances, including 10 starting berths. Many of these were in cup fixtures, but did include 3 Zurich Premiership starts, and a further 8 from the replacements bench.\nLeeds Tykes 2002–05.\nDickens joined the then Leeds Carnegie in August 2002, initially as short term cover for an injury crisis that was afflicting the club at the time, making his début against Leicester Tigers on 31 August 2002. His progress was so rapid though that he was soon making regular first team appearances and in his second and third seasons with the club became the first choice for the number 9 shirt.\nHe made 72 first team appearances for the Tykes in his three years with the club and culminated with a Powergen Cup winners medal having played in the Tykes victory over Bath at Twickenham in the 2005 final.\nThe cup win was to be a rare high point for Leeds though as at the end of that season they were relegated from the Premiership and Dickens left the club to seek further top flight competition at Saracens.\nSaracens 2005–2008.\nDickens made a rapid return to Twickenham for his début appearance for Saracens in the season opening London Double Header game against London Wasps on 3 September 2005.\nIn his time at Saracens he saw strong competition for first team spots from the likes of Fijian International Mosese Rauluni and first England's Kyran Bracken and then former Springbok Neil de Kock on the former's retirement, but he maintained his form to bring a large number of appearances both from the bench and in starting line ups in his first two full seasons with the club.\nNorthampton 2008–2010.\nDickens signed for Northampton in April 2008 even though Saints had just recruited two new scrum halves in Lee Dickson and Ben Foden. Dickens is working alongside the two younger players and acting as a back-up but now with limited first team playing opportunities.\nDickens retired from playing in 2010 to take up a new role as the Saints' Academy manager.\nCoaching.\nDickens coached at Northampton until 2019 where he joined England under 20s. On 29 May 2023 Dickens was announced as the new attack coach for Leicester Tigers."

        "title": "Traditions and anecdotes associated with the Stanley Cup",
        "text": "There are many traditions and anecdotes associated with the Stanley Cup. The Stanley Cup is the championship trophy of the National Hockey League (NHL), the major professional ice hockey league in Canada and the United States. It is commonly referred to as simply \"The Cup\", \"The Holy Grail\" or facetiously (chiefly by sportswriters) as \"Lord Stanley's Mug\".\nUnlike the trophies awarded by the other three major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada, a new Stanley Cup is not made annually; the champions keep the Cup until a new champion is crowned. It is also one of only two trophies in professional North American sports which has the name of the winning players, coaches, management, and club staff engraved upon it, the other being the CFL's Grey Cup.\nIt is at the centre of several legends and superstitions. Many of these anecdotes involve the Stanley Cup being mistreated in some way. It is the most-travelled championship trophy in the world.\nTraditions.\nDrinking.\nOne of the oldest traditions, started by the 1896 Winnipeg Victorias, dictates that the winning team drink champagne from the top bowl after their victory.\nOn-ice presentation.\nAnother tradition is the on-ice presentation of the Cup by the NHL commissioner to the captain of the winning team after the series-winning victory, and the subsequent carrying of the trophy around the rink by each member of the victorious club. This differs from the championship trophy ceremonies in the other three major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada, where the commissioners of Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, and National Football League instead present the Commissioner's Trophy, Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy, and Vince Lombardi Trophy, respectively, to the \"owners\" of the winning team. The on-ice presentation of the Cup is typically preceded by the presentation of the Conn Smythe Trophy, in contrast to the other three leagues who usually present the World Series MVP, NBA Finals MVP, and Super Bowl MVP awards, respectively, after their championship trophy.\nPossibly the first time that the Cup was awarded on the ice was to the 1932 Toronto Maple Leafs, and the practice became an annual tradition in the 1950s.\nCaptain hoisting the cup.\nTed Lindsay of the 1950 Cup champion Detroit Red Wings became the first player (Sid Abel was captain of Red Wings in 1950), upon receiving the Cup, to skate around with it, slightly raised for the crowd. Since then, it has been a tradition to have the captain of the winning team take a lap around the ice first with the trophy hoisted above his head (the hoisting of the Cup above their heads is sometimes credited to Frank Mahovlich of the Toronto Maple Leafs, who was photographed doing so after the 1963 Stanley Cup Finals). There are a few exceptions:\n1988.\nIn what would be Wayne Gretzky's final Cup win and final game as a member of the Edmonton Oilers, he gathered his teammates, coaches, trainers, and others from the Oilers organization to join at centre ice for an impromptu team photo with the trophy. This tradition has been continued by every subsequent Stanley Cup champion.\n1993.\nThe 1993 championship was won by the Montreal Canadiens. As Gary Bettman presented the Cup to Canadiens' captain Guy Carbonneau, Carbonneau waved to Denis Savard to come join him. Savard, who had played 10 seasons for the Chicago Blackhawks before being traded to Montreal in 1990–91 (the Blackhawks had since been to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1992), had not played in the Cup Finals in his career. Carbonneau let Savard hoist the Cup in his place.\n1998.\nThe 1998 championship was won by the defending champions Detroit Red Wings. The previous year, several days after their first Stanley Cup in 42 years, Vladimir Konstantinov had been paralyzed in an automobile accident that also paralyzed team masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov. As Bettman gave the cup to Red Wings' captain Steve Yzerman, he hoisted it before putting it on Konstantinov's lap and helping him parade with the trophy.\n2001.\nThe 2001 championship was won by the Colorado Avalanche. Until requesting a trade on March 6, 2000, Ray Bourque had played his entire career with the Boston Bruins. The seventh game of the 2001 Finals was the last of Bourque's 22-year NHL career. Though Bourque reached the Stanley Cup Finals twice with the Bruins in 1988 and 1990, the Bruins fell both times to the Edmonton Oilers, and Bourque had never been on a Cup-winning team until joining the Avalanche. When captain Joe Sakic received the trophy, he did not hoist it, but instead immediately handed it to Bourque for him to hoist. Sakic then followed Bourque in hoisting the trophy.\nTouching the Cup.\nAnother tradition (or rather superstition) that is prevalent among today's NHL players is that no player should touch the Cup itself until his team has rightfully won the Cup. Adding to this superstition is some players' choice to neither touch nor hoist the conference trophies (Clarence S. Campbell Bowl and Prince of Wales Trophy) when these series have been won; the players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy, and only it should be hoisted.\nNew York Islanders captain Denis Potvin hoisted the Wales Trophy during the 1982 and 1983 playoffs en route to the club successfully defending the Cup each time, sweeping the Vancouver Canucks in 1982 and the Edmonton Oilers in 1983. During the Islanders' first two runs to the Cup, no conference championship trophy was presented during the playoffs; instead, the Wales Trophy and the Campbell Bowl were awarded to the teams with the best regular season records in the respective conferences (the Islanders won the Campbell Bowl in 1980–81).\nHowever, in 1994, Stephane Matteau, then of the New York Rangers, admitted that he tapped the Wales Trophy with his stick's blade before the overtime period in game seven of the Eastern Conference Final. Matteau subsequently scored the game-winning goal in double overtime against the New Jersey Devils. Following the game, Mark Messier, the captain of the Rangers, picked up and raised the Wales Trophy after it was awarded to the team. After winning the Western Conference, Vancouver Canucks captain Trevor Linden lifted the Campbell trophy. The Rangers prevailed over the Canucks in a seven-game series to win the Cup.\nScott Stevens and Martin Brodeur hoisted the Wales trophy as well in 2000, after the New Jersey Devils came back from a 3–1 series deficit to defeat the Philadelphia Flyers in seven games; the Devils would go on to defeat the Dallas Stars (who touched but did not lift the Campbell Bowl) in the Stanley Cup Finals. Stevens also lifted the Wales trophy en route to the Devils' 1995 and 2003 Stanley Cup wins. In 2002 the Carolina Hurricanes hoisted the Wales Trophy after they won their conference title; the Hurricanes lost their Finals series with the Detroit Red Wings four games to one. Steve Yzerman, captain of the Red Wings during their 1997, 1998, and 2002 Stanley Cup victories, picked up the Campbell Bowl prior to that year's Cup Finals.\nThe superstition held true in 2004, as Jarome Iginla of the Calgary Flames grabbed the Campbell Bowl, but Dave Andreychuk of the Tampa Bay Lightning refused to touch the Wales Trophy; the Lightning won the Stanley Cup in seven games. In 2007, Daniel Alfredsson and Wade Redden of the Ottawa Senators touched and picked up the Wales Trophy, respectively, but Anaheim Ducks captain Scott Niedermayer never came close to the Campbell Bowl; the Ducks won the Stanley Cup in five games.\nIn 2008, neither the Pittsburgh Penguins' Sidney Crosby nor the Red Wings' Nicklas Lidstrom touched their respective conference trophies; the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup that year. The following year, however, Crosby decided to touch the Wales Trophy, and the Penguins went on to win the Stanley Cup. They did the same thing again in winning the 2016 and 2017 Stanley Cups; conversely, the San Jose Sharks' Joe Pavelski stayed true to the general tradition and did not touch the Campbell Bowl. Pittsburgh then went on to defeat San Jose in six games to win the Cup. The same occurred to the Nashville Predators when captain Mike Fisher refused to touch the Campbell Bowl one year later. One possible reason for Crosby lifting the trophy is that the Penguins have had good luck winning the Stanley Cup after lifting the Wales trophy; this was evident when Mario Lemieux lifted the Wales en route to the Penguins' 1991 and 1992 Cup wins.\nIn 2010, Philadelphia Flyers captain Mike Richards picked up the Wales Trophy, while Chicago Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews did not touch the Campbell Bowl. The Blackhawks went on to defeat the Flyers in six games for the 2010 Stanley Cup. Subsequently, between 2011 and 2015, none of the Stanley Cup finalists touched either the Campbell or the Wales trophies. The 2012 Los Angeles Kings, after defeating the Phoenix Coyotes in five games, went so far as leaving the Campbell Bowl in Phoenix. Instead Tim Leiweke, President and CEO of Anschutz Entertainment Group (the parent of the LA Kings), drove the trophy in his car trunk from Phoenix to Los Angeles and showed it to the 10,000+ fans that waited at LAX Airport to show their support to their Stanley Cup finalists, who went on to win the Stanley Cup. This was in marked contrast to 1993, when the Kings had defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in seven games to reach their first Cup Finals, where Wayne Gretzky and the team celebrated with the Campbell Bowl, and during the Finals, the trophy was unveiled before the start of game three (the Kings lost the series in five games, including three overtime losses).\nIn 2018, both conference champions, the Vegas Golden Knights and Washington Capitals, picked up the Campbell Bowl and Prince of Wales Trophy, respectively, marking the first time since 2002 both conference championship trophies were skated. Deryk Engelland accepted the Campbell Bowl for the Golden Knights, becoming the first player to pick up the trophy on the ice since Iginla 14 years earlier. Capitals superstar Alexander Ovechkin skated the Prince of Wales Trophy with his teammates, then won the Conn Smythe Trophy after leading Washington to the Stanley Cup, its first championship in franchise history. The Golden Knights reversed course in 2023 after captain Mark Stone refused to touch the Campbell Bowl; they eventually won the Stanley Cup that year.\nIn 2019, neither Boston Bruins' captain Zdeno Chára nor St. Louis Blues' captain Alex Pietrangelo touched their respective conference trophies. This was the first time since 2015 that neither conference championship trophy was hoisted.\nIn 2015, Lightning captain Steven Stamkos followed Andreychuk's example from 2004 by refusing to touch the Prince of Wales Trophy. However, the Lightning lost to the Blackhawks in the Cup Finals, so when the team won their third Eastern Conference championship five seasons later, Stamkos changed course and touched the trophy. Stamkos likewise touched the Wales trophy again in 2021 and 2022. The Lightning defied superstition by winning both the 2020 and 2021 Stanley Cup.\nThe Dallas Stars had previously touched the Campbell Bowl in 1999 and 2000 with Derian Hatcher as the captain; in the former season, the Stars won the Cup. But when the Stars won again in 2020, captain Jamie Benn refused to touch the trophy. Similarly, the Montreal Canadiens' captain Guy Carbonneau had hoisted the Wales Trophy in 1993 and went on to win the Cup, but when they won the semifinal round in 2021, captain Shea Weber refused to touch the Campbell Bowl. In both cases, the Stars and Canadiens lost in the Cup Finals to the Lightning.\nThe Colorado Avalanche, led by then-captain Joe Sakic, had previously touched the Campbell Bowl en route to their 1996 and 2001 Cup wins. So when the team won the Campbell again in 2022, captain Gabriel Landeskog elected to touch the Campbell Bowl. The Avalanche ended up winning the Stanley Cup that year, defeating the two-time defending champion Lightning.\nThe Florida Panthers touched the Prince of Wales Trophy each time they won it. In 1996, captain Brian Skrudland hoisted the trophy, in the same year the Avalanche touched the Campbell Bowl. In 2023, captain Aaron Ekblad followed suit and touched the trophy as well. However, the Panthers lost the Stanley Cup Finals both times.\nFive of the last six Stanley Cup champions from the Eastern Conference have picked up the Prince of Wales Trophy. The exception was the 2011 Bruins, captained by Chára.\nAdventures.\nOne of the most recognized trophies in professional sports in the US and Canada, the Cup has logged more than during the past five seasons alone.\nPlayers' day with cup.\nPlayers have unofficially had a private day with the Cup, a tradition that started with the New Jersey Devils in 1995 wherein each member of the Cup-winning team is allowed personal possession of the Cup for a day. It is always accompanied by at least one representative from the Hockey Hall of Fame. The tradition became subject of an ESPN marketing campaign which showed players using the Cup: Ken Daneyko ate cereal out of it, Derian Hatcher used it as a cooler at a party, and Brett Hull locked himself out of his vehicle with the Cup inside while out shopping with Mike Modano. Tomas Holmström's cousin, Robert, used the trophy to baptize his seven-week-old daughter during Tomas' day with the Cup. Clark Gillies of the New York Islanders allowed his dog to eat out of the Cup. Dustin Brown of the Los Angeles Kings had his two older boys drink chocolate milk out of the cup. In 2015, Chico Resch, 1979-80 Stanley Cup champion with the New York Islanders, was arranged for the opportunity to spend his day with the Trophy, an honor that was unavailable in his playing days. This happened upon his retirement as a color commentator for New Jersey Devils.\nEurope.\nThe Cup first left North America in 1996 when it went to Sweden with Peter Forsberg; he took it to Stockholm as well as to his hometown Örnsköldsvik.\nIn Russia, it has been to Red Square and a soccer game at Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, and to a monument near Yekaterinburg marking the geographic boundary between Europe and Asia. It went west to Kyiv, Ukraine, for the first time with Tampa Bay Game-7 hero Ruslan Fedotenko; Carolina Hurricanes defenceman Anton Babchuk returned with it, again to Kyiv. After 114 years, the Cup made a trip in April 2006 back to London, where it was originally purchased. A plaque was placed at the site of the store where Lord Stanley purchased the Cup. In 2007, the Cup went to Helsinki, Finland, with Anaheim Ducks' forward Teemu Selänne. Tomas Holmström took the trophy to his hometown Piteå in Sweden in the summer of 2008. He used the trophy as a baptismal font for his niece, and also as a serving dish for pitepalt. Boston Bruins' captain Zdeno Chára took the Cup to Slovakia after winning it in 2011. In 2012, Anže Kopitar took the Cup to his home country of Slovenia and hoisted it atop Bled Castle after the Los Angeles Kings won that year.\nNorth America.\nThe Stanley Cup went to Port Dover, Ontario, with Jassen Cullimore when the Tampa Bay Lightning won the cup. He was the fourth NHLer to take the cup to this small hockey town on the shore of Lake Erie. It went to Simcoe, Ontario with Rob Blake when the Colorado Avalanche won the cup. A parade was held in his honor, and a private party was thrown for family and friends. Assistant Coach Colin Campbell took it to his hometown Tillsonburg, Ontario after the New York Rangers won in 1994. Daniel Cleary took the Cup to his hometown of Harbour Grace, Newfoundland. As the first Newfoundlander to win the Cup, he attracted an estimated crowd of 27,000 to the tiny community of just over 3,000. The Cup went to the top of Fisher Peak, near Cranbrook, British Columbia and the top of Mount Elbert in Colorado. Brad Richards from Murray Harbour, Prince Edward Island took the Stanley Cup out on a fishing boat after the Tampa Bay Lightning won the cup. It went to an Aboriginal Métis Nation Settlement, and it went to an igloo in Rankin Inlet. It served as the engagement ring bearer for the Tampa Bay Lightning's André Roy while in a helicopter flown by Guy Lafleur.\nThe Cup has experienced Los Angeles celebrity glamour, having been taken on a roller coaster ride at Universal Studios Hollywood, and to the Hollywood Sign by Luc Robitaille. It also took part in the 2008 Tournament of Roses Parade as part of Anaheim city's float, accompanied by player Brad May as his Anaheim Ducks team were the current reigning champions.\nIt was also a White House guest of Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden, and it is currently a tradition of the U.S. president to invite the NHL champion if the team is from an American city. It is a similar tradition for the Prime Minister of Canada to invite the winners, if it is a Canadian team that wins, to Ottawa (however, no Canadian team has won the Cup since the Montreal Canadiens did so in 1993). The Cup has appeared on \"The Pat McAfee Show\", \"Corner Gas\", the \"Late Show with David Letterman\", \"Meet the Press\" with Tim Russert, \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\", \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\", and \"The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon\". It has served as the baptismal font for Sylvain Lefebvre's daughter.\nThe Cup has even gained experience as an \"actor\". It has appeared in several scenes of the long-running soap opera \"Guiding Light\". It also appeared on \"Boston Legal\" where William Shatner knocked it off a balcony, and on the \"30 Rock\" episode \"Subway Hero\". It also appeared on \"Chicago Fire\" along with the Keeper of the Cup, Phil Pritchard.\nOn a humanitarian note, the Cup visited wounded United States Marines at Camp Lejeune with Glen Wesley after his Carolina Hurricanes won the Cup in 2006.\nAfter the Chicago Blackhawks win in 2010 the Cup appeared in the 2010 Chicago Gay Pride Parade, with team representative defenceman Brent Sopel. Sopel appeared to honor his friend, Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Brian Burke, Burke's late son, Brendan and the Burkes' example of family support and tolerance.\nDuring decommissioning of the Space Shuttle \"Atlantis\", the Cup visited the orbiter's flight deck after being taken to Florida. Jeremy Jacobs, the owner of the 2011 NHL champion Boston Bruins, took the Cup to Florida for employees involved in the decommissioning to view and photograph.\nOn May 7, 2016, the morning of the Kentucky Derby, the NHL brought the Cup to Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky for a photo session with race favorite Nyquist, named after then-Detroit Red Wings player Gustav Nyquist. Nyquist would go on to win the Derby.\nWhen the Washington Capitals won the Cup in 2018, team captain Alex Ovechkin and his teammates took the Cup around Washington, DC and celebrated with the team's fans. Among the many locations where Ovechkin took the cup included other sporting events and public squares.\nAfghanistan.\nOn May 2, 2007, the Stanley Cup arrived in Kandahar on a Canadian Forces C-130 Hercules transport aircraft. Seventeen former players played a ball hockey game versus Canadian soldiers on a concrete rink in the Afghan desert.\nMisadventures.\nThe Cup has also been mistreated, misplaced, or otherwise misused on numerous occasions.\nOne legend is that in 1905, a member of the Ottawa Senators (also known as the \"Ottawa Silver Seven\") tried to drop kick the Cup across the Rideau Canal after the championship banquet. The attempt failed, and the Cup was not retrieved until the next day; the canal was still frozen over. The Ottawas had been celebrating their decisive Stanley Cup win over the Dawson City Nuggets. Several of the Ottawa players were also members of the Ottawa Football Club. However, Bill Westwick, \"Ottawa Journal\" sports editor and the son of Silver Seven player Rat Westwick, and NHL commissioner Frank Calder both deny it ever happened. No contemporary reports support the legend, although champagne was drunk from the Cup that night.\nIn 1906, weeks after members of the Montreal Wanderers left it at a photographer's studio, officials learned that the photographer's mother was using the Cup to plant geraniums. In 1907, a Kenora Thistles team manager threatened to throw the Cup into the Lake of the Woods in a dispute over the eligibility of two Thistles players.\nIn 1924, members of the Montreal Canadiens, en route to celebrate their win at owner Leo Dandurand's home, left it by the road after repairing a flat tire. The Cup was recovered exactly where they left it. In 1925, Lynn and Muzz Patrick, the sons of Victoria Cougars manager-coach Lester Patrick, discovered the Cup in the basement of their home, and scratched their names on it with a nail. In 1940, their names were properly engraved on it as members of the champion New York Rangers. They also urinated in the Cup with teammates.\nDuring the 1940–41 NHL season, the mortgage on Madison Square Garden was paid. The management publicly celebrated by burning the mortgage in the Cup. Some fans claimed this act \"desecrated\" the Cup, leading to the Curse of 1940, which allegedly caused the Rangers to wait 54 years for another win.\nIn 1957, Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard chipped both of his front teeth while drinking from the Stanley Cup.\nIn the Chicago Stadium, in the spring of 1961, the Montreal Canadiens were losing the final game of a playoff series to the Chicago Black Hawks. A Montreal fan (Ken Kilander) in the stands was upset, so he left his seat, ran down to the front lobby and broke into the glass showcase where the Stanley Cup was on display. He grabbed the Cup, hoisted it over his shoulders and made for the exit before he was arrested. In court, he explained his behaviour to the judge: \"Your Honor, I was simply bringing the Cup back to Montreal where it belongs.\"\nIn 1962, the Toronto Maple Leafs won the Stanley Cup. During a party after the win, the trophy was dropped in a bonfire and badly damaged. It was repaired at the expense of the team.\nIn 1964, Red Kelly of the Toronto Maple Leafs posed for a photo with his infant son sitting in the Cup, only to find the child had urinated in it. Kelly was quoted years later as saying it has always since made him laugh to see players drinking out of the Cup.\nIn 1970, after much wear and tear, the Cup was fully replaced with a duplicate known as the \"Presentation Cup\" made in 1963 and a second duplicate called the \"Permanent Cup\", which remains at the Hockey Hall of Fame. From this point on, in official functions and player days with the Cup, it is the Presentation Cup that is in circulation.\nClark Gillies of the New York Islanders filled the Cup with dog food and let his dog eat out of it. He defended doing so by saying \"He's a good dog.\"\nThe New York Islanders' Bryan Trottier admitted to sleeping with the Cup (as have, apparently, dozens of players).\nIn 1987, the Edmonton Oilers' Mark Messier took it to his favourite club in his hometown of St. Albert, Alberta, and let fans drink out of it. It wound up slightly bent in various places for unknown reasons. It was repaired at a local automotive shop, and shipped back to the Hockey Hall of Fame.\nThe 1991 Pittsburgh Penguins and 1993 Montreal Canadiens decided to test its buoyancy by tossing it into Mario Lemieux's and Patrick Roy's respective pools (\"The Stanley Cup\"—noted then–Canadiens' captain Guy Carbonneau—\"does not float.\"). Dominik Hašek had his 2002 visit with the Cup cut short for doing the same.\nAfter the Montreal Canadiens Cup win in 1993, members of the team apparently signed their names on the inside of the Cup with a sharp object.\nAfter the parade in their honor in 1994, members of the New York Rangers, including Mike Richter, took the cup to McSorley's Old Ale House, locked the doors, and for 45 minutes allowed the patrons to hoist it above their heads and drink McSorley's Dark and Light out of it. The \"New York Post\" reported the next day that the cup was taken back by the league for \"repairs\" to its base. Later, several New York Rangers took the Cup to Belmont Park, filled it with oats, and let Kentucky Derby winner Go for Gin eat out of it.\nThe 1999 Dallas Stars' Stanley Cup party was hosted at the house of Stars defenceman Craig Ludwig and Pantera drummer Vinnie Paul. At the party, Stars forward Guy Carbonneau (apparently having forgotten the Cup's lack of buoyancy from his 1993 adventures) allegedly attempted to throw the Cup from the upstairs deck into the house's Crown Royal shaped pool below. The Cup caught the lip of the pool, producing a large dent. Mike Bolt, one of the \"Keepers of the Cup\" for the NHL, stated that this never happened. \"What happened was that one of the players was posing with it next to the pool when someone pushed him into the water, and it went in with him. It was in the water maybe two seconds,\" Bolt said. \"It was a real good party from what I understand.\" The trophy was dented the previous day, when a player dropped it during a locker room celebration, Bolt said.\nIn 1999 and 2003, the cup made a trip to Joe Nieuwendyk's alma mater, Cornell University, both times visiting a local college bar. In 2003, Martin Brodeur ate popcorn out of the Cup. It had butter stains and salt damage for the next eight days before Jamie Langenbrunner cleaned it. In 2003, the Cup was slated to make its first-ever visit to Slovakia with New Jersey Devils' Jiri Bicek, but was left behind in Canada; it was on the next flight out of Toronto. Finally, on August 22, 2004, Walter Neubrand, keeper of the Cup, boarded a plane to Fort St. John, British Columbia, to deliver it to Tampa Bay Lightning head scout Jake Goertzen. However, Air Canada officials at Vancouver International Airport removed it before takeoff because of weight restrictions. The Cup spent the night in the luggage area, away. It was flown to Fort St. John the following day.\nIn 2007, a photoshoot on the set of the NBC television series \"Heroes\" showed actors Milo Ventimiglia and Hayden Panettiere \"goofing off\" with the cup, including worshiping, walking with, and Hayden licking and kissing the trophy.\nAlso, in May 2007, the cup made it to the set of ABC's \"Boston Legal\", a series written and created by former college hockey player David E. Kelley. In the Episode \"Duck and Cover\", Denny Crane pulls some strings to get his hands on the Cup for a day. While on loan, he takes it up to his office where he decides to engrave his name on it, noting that, \"They'll never notice. It's got so many dings on it already.\" That evening, he takes it to his penthouse office patio where he decides to drink scotch out of it with Alan Shore. After they take turns drinking out of the Cup, Denny sets it on the balcony ledge in preparation for taking pictures with it, but accidentally knocks it over. With a long, speechless pause, they watch the Cup tumble off the balcony to land on the street below. And with a loud, graceless metallic 'clunk', Alan comments, \"That will leave a significant ding!\" \nOn June 7, 2007, after the Anaheim Ducks won the Cup, their captain Scott Niedermayer brought the trophy to the set in Los Angeles of \"Jim Rome is Burning\". While the Cup was on set, the associate producer of \"JRIB\", Travis Rodgers, hoisted and posed with the Cup. The images were then posted on Jim Rome's website, which upset many Canadians, who called Rome's radio show on June 8 to complain that Rodgers had disrespected the Cup. Don Cherry called into the program to defend Rodgers, stating his belief that he did not disrespect the Cup at all.\nOn June 6, 2008, after the Red Wings' Stanley Cup Parade, the Stanley Cup was pushed off a table at Chris Chelios' Chili Bar in Detroit, Michigan and received a dent, which was later smoothed out. After the 2008 NHL Awards, it was revealed that the damage was more extensive than originally realized.\nA week after the same Detroit team won the Cup, Kris Draper's newborn daughter defecated in the Cup as she sat in it. The Cup was thoroughly cleaned and Draper reportedly drank from it that same day.\nOn October 9, 2008, Def Leppard's Joe Elliott placed the Cup upside down on a pedestal on the stage during one of their NHL Face-Off Rocks segments at the Fox Theater in Detroit. Red Wings defenseman Chris Chelios claimed the musician disgraced the Cup on purpose. Shortly after the incident, an article on Def Leppard's website appeared with Elliott claiming that every other sports cup he had ever seen before then was smaller at its base than at the top, so he thought this cup was no different.\nOn June 17, 2010, the \"Chicago Tribune\" swabbed the Cup for germs. A lab tech for EMSL Analytical stated no staph, salmonella or E. coli were found and the general bacteria count was 4% of what is typically found on an office desk. On April 21, 2011, it was traveling in Quebec City when its vehicle broke down forcing keeper of the Cup Mike Bolt to hitchhike with the Cup.\nOn August 30, 2011, during Michael Ryder's day with the cup, it fell off a table at a media event in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. This was just prior to the Cup's departure to Ryder's home town of Bonavista, Newfoundland and Labrador.\nOn July 12, 2021, during a strong thunderstorm at an outdoor celebration following the conclusion of the Tampa Bay Lightning's victory parade, Patrick Maroon accidentally dropped the Stanley Cup due to the rainy conditions, damaging the bowl. The Cup had to be sent back to be repaired in Montreal before the players could have their day with the trophy.\nOn June 26, 2022, during the on-ice celebrations immediately after winning the Stanley Cup, Nicolas Aubé-Kubel of the Colorado Avalanche tripped on his way to the team photo and fell to the ice denting the base of the cup in the process."

They play in the Top12 having finished 2nd in the 2012–13 edition, losing to Mogliano Rugby in the final.\nHistory.\nThe team was formed in 2000 through the merger of three existing rugby clubs: I Sorci Verdi (the first rugby team in Prato, founded in 1958), S.S. Rugby Prato and Rugby Iolo.\nDuring the 2005–06 season, they qualified for the Serie A play-offs for the first time. Hoping for promotion to the Super 10, they won the first leg of their semi-final before losing the home leg and going out by aggregate score.\nIn the following season, they won both legs of the semi-final before losing the final 13–10 to Venezia. In the 2008–09 Serie A tournament they were promoted to the 2009–10 version of the Super 10, after beating L'Aquila in the promotion playoff 25–18.\nIn their first season Cavalieri ended the regular season at the fifth place of Super 10 2009–10 and achieved the right to take part in the European Challenge Cup.\nCavalieri were drawn in Pool 1 Amlin Challenge Cup 2010–11 with Harlequins (ENG), Connacht (IRL) and Bayonne (FRA). The Cavalieri won their European debut against Connacht on 9 October 2010 by 23 – 21.\nIn June 2010 Cavalieri Prato merged with other ten Tuscan rugby clubs to form \"Cavalieri Toscana Rugby Eccellenza\", a new rugby franchise with the aim to represent the professional élite rugby of region Tuscany. The team reached the play-off final of both 2011–12 and 2012–13 Eccellenza tournaments, losing the final against Cammi Calvisano and Mogliano Rugby, respectively.\nDue to economic and corporate problems, the troubled 2014-15 season ended with the last place in the standings and the subsequent relegation to Serie A. Florence 1931, also relegated from series A to series B, acquired the title sportsman and could therefore maintain the superior category. Subsequently the president of the club, Fabrizio Tonfoni decided, together with the top management of Florence, to proceed with a merger between the clubs, with the aim of creating a more competitive team in the Serie A championship. The newly formed team took the name of Rugby Club I Medicei, based in Florence in the same sports facility as the now former Florence Rugby 1931."

The second World Championships were in 1984, and they have been a biannual event since then with the exception of the COVID-19 pandemic period, which delayed the 2020 event by one year.\nWorlds have been held in 13 countries across four continents: North and South America as well as Asia and Europe. The United States has hosted Worlds most often – 4 times, though not since 1996, followed by Mexico, 3 times, and twice each in Canada, the Dominican Republic, and South Korea.\nThe 2022 World Championships were held in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, which was the first time Worlds was in Mexico since 2000, when it was also held in San Luis Potosí. The 2022 Worlds introduced Mixed Doubles for the first time, and re-introduced the Team Competition (best of three matches: two singles &amp; one doubles), which was held at Worlds until 2012, after which the team winners were determined by the points earned in the individual competitions.\nAlso, the 2022 World Championships used a best of five games match format with each game to 11 points, win by 2, with rally scoring, as used in other sports like squash and volleyball. Rally scoring – the winner of every rally scores a point – was introduced at Worlds in 2021. Previously, racquetball games used side-out scoring, where players scored points only when they had won a rally which began with that player serving. Rallies won when not serving were simply side-outs: the rally losing player lost the serve and the rally winning player won the opportunity to serve, but did not win a point."

For the European Championship, only games between European sides in the first round are included.\nThis was a historic tournament in a few respects. The Soviets were playing without goaltender Tretiak for the first time since 1969. This was Canada's best finish since returning to the Championships in 1977, and after defeating the Soviet Union for the first time in the World Championships since 1961, they played for gold on the last day. Despite Canada's silver medal, the first round saw a professionally stocked Canada lose to the Americans for the first time. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the tournament was Sweden's poor play. After finishing second in the 1984 Canada Cup expectations were high, but they had their worst finish since 1937, playing in the relegation pool for the first time. It would also be East Germany's final appearance at the top level.\nThe tournament finished on a sour note when the US and Soviet Union faced off against each other for the bronze medal. Several fights broke out, resulting in suspensions of coaches Viktor Tikhonov and Dave Peterson, as well as players Irek Gimayev, Vyacheslav Fetisov and Tim Thomas.

        "text": "The 1986 State of Origin series was the fifth year that the annual three-match series between New South Wales and Queensland was contested entirely under \"state of origin\" selection rules. It was the year that New South Wales finally asserted some dominance and won the series in the first ever 3-0 Origin whitewash. It was an inauspicious introduction to Origin coaching for Wayne Bennett who soon afterwards began plotting a reversal of fortunes that would lead to a pending period of Queensland dominance.\nGames.\nGame I.\nThe Blues finally brought to Origin a passion that had hitherto been associated mainly with Queensland and fielded a formidable halves pairing in Peter Sterling and Brett Kenny that found the measure of Maroons star Wally Lewis. Blues hooker Royce Simmons typified the newfound New South Wales' spirit when early in the opening game he was knocked senseless, after a vicious hit by Queensland's Greg Dowling. He staggered back into position, falling over and regaining his feet then waving trainers away as he took his place in the defensive formation before pulling off a try-saving tackle on his own tryline soon after.\nThe Blues led 12-2 early but by half-time the lead was cut to 12-10. Two minutes after the break Queensland forged to the front when prop Greg Dowling scored after centre Gene Miles recovered a Wally Lewis bomb. The Maroons then began to tire and Man Of The Match Royce Simmons scored from dummy half to spark a magnificent comeback, dummying past a bewildered Wally Lewis. A mistake by Queensland winger Dale Shearer opened the door for Blues' centre Andrew Farrar to score his first Origin try and the Blues led 22-16 with 13 minutes remaining and were able to hold on to a lead.\nSimmons was interviewed in 2010: \"The Queenslanders were going 'Ooohh, yeahh' when I fell over. They were really cheering me or bagging me or something...everytime I fell over. All I kept thinking was 'I can't get replaced; if I get replaced there goes my opportunity' so I struggled to get back up and few minutes later I was OK. It was a good win...and we played a very good Queensland side to do it\"\nGame II.\nQueensland's preparation for game II was disrupted by injuries to key players and selectors were forced to name one of the Maroons' most inexperienced line-ups.\nBefore a record Origin crowd of 40,707 at the SCG, the class of Lewis and Queensland again led into the second half 16-12 after 52 minutes before Sterling and Kenny engineered a New South Wales onslaught. Man-of-the-match Sterling then threw a sweetly timed pass for Kenny to take New South Wales to an 18-16 lead and four minutes later second-rower Noel Cleal crashed over between the posts for an unassailable 24-16 scoreline. Queensland scored in the final minutes through Shearer but their hopes of a last-ditch victory were dashed.\nGame III.\nFor the third year running the final match of the series was a dead rubber, but with Test positions on the line for the three clashes with New Zealand and the end of season Kangaroo tour plus the opportunity for New South Wales to become the first team to win 3-0, there was plenty to play for.\nThe first half produced one of Origin's most frenetic periods. By the time the teams left the field at the break seven tries had been scored and the scores were locked at 16-all. In the second stanza no more tries were added. The game was won by a Michael O'Connor penalty goal after referee Kevin Roberts had penalised Maroon's skipper Lewis for failing to clear the ruck.\nWith the victory New South Wales enjoyed the first ever 3-0 series whitewash."

        "text": "The Halifax bid for the 2014 Commonwealth Games was a withdrawn bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games by Halifax Regional Municipality, the capital of the province of Nova Scotia, Canada.\nThe bid was eventually won by Glasgow (Scotland), who beat Abuja (Nigeria) after a vote of 47 to 24 vote by the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) General Assembly on 9 November 2007 in Sri Lanka.\nBackground.\nHalifax and Hamilton were both finalists in the selection process to host the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Hamilton won the right to bid for the 2010 Commonwealth Games ahead of Halifax. New Delhi eventually beat Hamilton in the competition to host the games.\nCanada has hosted the Commonwealth Games on four previous occasions (Hamilton 1930, Vancouver 1954, Edmonton 1978 and Victoria 1994).\nHalifax, Ottawa, York Region, Hamilton and Calgary all submitted proposals and a deposit to Commonwealth Games Association of Canada (CGC) by the deadline of 22 July 2005, in order to be considered as potential hosts of the 2014 Commonwealth Games.\nSelection process.\nSelection of bid city for Canada.\nThe key dates for the Canadian selection process were as follows:\nSelection of host city for the 2014 Commonwealth Games.\nThe key dates for the Commonwealth Games selection process were as follows:\nThe final selection of the Canadian bid.\nA Bid Review Committee (BRC) was established to evaluate each bid city proposal and to recommend a Canadian Candidate Bid City to the CGC.\nOnly Halifax, Ottawa, York Region and Hamilton actually submitted bid proposals to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games on 1 November 2005. Calgary had by then pulled out of the running. Presentations were held on 13 December 2005 by each bid city to the BRC and two days later Halifax had been chosen to be Canada's bid city for the 2014 Commonwealth Games.\nThe Halifax 2014 Commonwealth Games Bid Society, also known as \"The Bid Society\", had been established and had appointed Scott Logan as the chief executive officer and Fred MacGillivray as the chair. They had established a website (www.2014halifax.com/) and had plans and budgets for hosting the Games.\nThe withdrawal of the bid.\nThe Bid Society and CGC gave an estimate of C$1.6 billion for hosting the games and this figure was presented to the Government of Canada, the Province of Nova Scotia and the Halifax Regional Municipality on 26 January 2007. This figure was considered too high and not realistic, therefore at a meeting of the Bid Society on 7 March 2007, they provided options to reduce the budget from $1.6 billion to $1.3 billion. Without offering precise funding commitment figures, the three levels of government indicated that further reductions were still needed. The CGC and the Bid Society committed themselves to reduce this figure again to funding of approximately $1 billion ($900 million coming from the three levels of government and $100–$200 million from other sponsors such as Sport Canada and from Games revenues). The Government of Canada was committed to contribute up to $396.5 million for Halifax to host the games alone.\nSport Canada commissioned a consultant to evaluate the 2014 business plan and budgets. The \"McMahon Report\" was delivered to the province and regional governments in draft form without any prior review by the Bid Society or the CGC. This report was very critical of the 2014 plan and budget.\nHowever the Bid Society required more time to present a new financial package to reduce costs down to $1 billion, but the following day on 8 March 2007 the provincial and regional governments decided to withdraw their support, which then ended the Halifax 2014 bid. The CGC would have liked to have put forward another city to represent Canada in the 2014 bid process, but this was not possible as all bidding cities had to register their intent with the CGF a year earlier in 2006. \nDr. Andrew Pipe, President of CGC, said:\nIt was the first time that Canada had withdrawn a bid for a Commonwealth Games event."

He also won a silver medal in the long jump event.\nThe history of the Caprilli substitution.\nAt the Summer Olympic Games in Paris 1900, in both competitions he won the two medals on the saddle of Oreste, a horse that was initially due to the great Federico Caprilli, his teacher, who, after sending his horses to France, was recalled by a telegram from the Ministry of War that forbade the expatriation to the military in career following the dissolution of the Chambers. This situation evidently was not well communicated to the judges of the race and this led to confusion to the point that in some books of gold it was erroneously indicated Caprilli in place of Trissino. According to some reconstructions Caprilli could indeed have reached Paris in disguise from Turin to complete the preparation of his horses, giving rise to fictional voices related to his active participation in competitions.\nAwards.\nOn 7 May 2015, in the presence of the President of Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI), Giovanni Malagò, was inaugurated in the Olympic Park of the Foro Italico in Rome, along \"Viale delle Olimpiadi\", the Walk of Fame of Italian sport, consisting of 100 tiles that chronologically report names of the most representative athletes in the history of Italian sport.

Elf being an oil company that was owned by the Renault auto group.\nDuring this time the team with Bernard Hinault dominated the sport from 1978 to 1983 with four wins in the Tour de France, two wins in the Vuelta a España and two wins in the Giro d'Italia. Hinault won several smaller stage races as well as one day races which included Liège–Bastogne–Liège, Paris–Roubaix, Giro di Lombardia, the Amstel Gold Race and the 1980 World Cycling Championships.\nGuimard signed several American riders which included future Tour de France winner Greg LeMond. LeMond made an immediate impression with his third-place finish behind Hinault in the 1981 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré. Hinault left the team at the end of 1983 after Renault–Elf teammate Laurent Fignon took over the designated team leader after winning the 1983 Tour de France.\nGreg LeMond added to the team's laurels by winning the 1983 World Championship. The following year Fignon finished high in the Giro d'Italia, and then went on to become the 1984 French National Champion and winner of the 1984 Tour de France.\nThe dominance of the team began to wane in 1985, with Fignon suffering from persistent knee injury and rising star Greg LeMond leaving the team for Hinault's La Vie Claire team. The highlight of the 1985 season was Marc Madiot's win in the cobbled classic Paris–Roubaix.\nAfter the 1985 season, the Renault auto group retired from sponsoring in the peloton and the French supermarket Système U became the main sponsor of Guimard's team. The team continued to ride on Gitane bicycle frames, who were co-sponsors for the team."

        "text": "An equestrian drill team is a group of horses and riders performing choreographed maneuvers to music. Teams typically perform at rodeos, horse fairs, parades, benefits, and drill team competitions. Drill teams are intended to entertain, show sportsmanship, horsemanship, teamwork and dedication. Competition drill at the national level is a controlled ride and has continuous forward motion. Some competition venues have set up special divisions of competition to provide for novice, rodeo, youth, gaited and special effects (as allowed at the venue) such as theme and drama. Theme drill provides a division that allows teams to showcase their uniforms, horse ability, music, and inclusions of trick riding or other variations.\nMembers must have a uniform appearance, including outfits, hats, tack, and flags (if used). Horses should be of the same type, e.g. stock type, gaited, or miniature, however matching horse colors or breeds are at the team's discretion. Teams can range in size from four horses (Quad team) to 20 plus horses.\nAt competitions, a drill team is judged on ability, including spacing and alignment, timing and coordination, originality, difficulty, and attractiveness of patterns, speed, horsemanship, uniformity, manners of the animals, music, and crowd appeal. Categories can include Novice, Youth, 4-H, Gaited, Theme, Rodeo, Quad, or Open.\nThe United States Equestrian Drill Association (USEDA) is the governing body for mounted drill and color guard competitions in the United States. The USEDA sanctions competitions throughout the United States. The United States Equestrian Drill Championship (USEDC) is held each June at the Texas Rose Horse Park near Lindale, Texas as part of Super Ride - an International Festival of the Equestrian Arts.\nThe USEDA was developed after the Washington Ladies Riding Club Association was officially established in 1980. Currently the WLRCA hosts yearly competitions, leads clinics and helps establishes rules and guidelines for other teams to learn by. Participants from WLRCA fly all over the United States, providing clinics, judging, or offering insight to this wonderous world of drill."

        "text": "The Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball team (formerly the Marquette Hilltoppers and Marquette Warriors) represents Marquette University in NCAA Division I college basketball and competes in the Big East Conference. The team plays its home games at Fiserv Forum in downtown Milwaukee (also the home of the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks).\nMarquette has made 35 NCAA tournament appearances, including 23 round of 32 appearances, 17 sweet sixteens, 7 elite eights, and 3 final fours. They were the national runner-up 1 time and have won 1 national championship. Marquette first joined a conference in 1989, winning 5 conference regular season championships and 2 conference tournament championships. Marquette has had 3 national coaches of the year, 4 conference coaches of the year, 1 national player of the year, 9 consensus all-americans, 4 conference players of the year, and 16 all-conference first team selections.

Additionally, 39 Marquette players have gone on to play in the NBA combining for 7 NBA championships, 25 NBA all-star selections, and 11 all-NBA selections.\nHistory.\nMcGuire era.\nAl McGuire became the head coach in 1964 and brought the program to national prominence, earning an NIT Championship in 1970 and a Final Four appearance in 1974 against the North Carolina State Wolfpack, where McGuire became the first coach ejected from a championship McGuire coached with assistants Hank Raymonds and Rick Majerus, who each had their own stints as head of the program following his departure. In his final season as a collegiate head coach, McGuire led Marquette to its only NCAA basketball championship in 1977. Led by Alfred \"Butch\" Lee, Maurice \"Bo\" Ellis and Jerome Whitehead, the team beat UNC Charlotte in the national semifinals after Whitehead received a full-court pass and subsequently made a last-second shot. Two days later, Marquette defeated Dean Smith's North Carolina Tar Heels for the title. The team set a record with seven losses going into the NCAA tournament, the most losses up to that time for a team that would win the NCAA Championship.\nCrean era.\nTom Crean took over the program on March 30, 1999. According to Crean, \"Once Marquette became available, that's where my sights were. I had unbelievable respect for the tradition and the name. When I thought of Marquette, I thought of a true basketball school and to me that had a lot to do with it.\" Crean immediately made a number of changes at Marquette, creating a new team image by increasing the significance of the team's media day and instituting a \"Midnight Madness\" event commonly held by schools on the night teams are allowed to begin practice. Crean's first recruiting class was considered by experts to be among the top twenty in the country, Marquette's first in a long time.\nIn his nine years with Marquette, Crean's teams earned five NCAA tournament bids, one more than the previous four Marquette coaches had in the 16 years prior to his arrival. During his tenure there Crean recruited, developed and coached a number of skilled players that made significant contributions in both the NCAA and NBA, including Dwyane Wade, Dominic James, Steve Novak, Wesley Matthews, and Travis Diener.\nOver his final seven seasons at Marquette, Crean compiled an aggregate record of 160–68 (.702). The 2002–03 season was one of the best in Marquette history. The team made a Final Four appearance for the first time since winning the NCAA Championship in 1977. Crean has referred to the team's run as \"one of the greatest four or five days of my life.\"\nLater that year, Marquette accepted an offer to leave Conference USA for the Big East Conference after the 2004–2005 season. Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese cited his friendship with Crean as contributing to the invitation, saying, \"That, to me, was one of the great appeals, to get Tommy as well as Marquette into the league.\"\nWhen Crean was asked why he left Marquette, Crean replied, \"It's Indiana. It's Indiana, and that is the bottom line.\"\nWilliams era.\nAfter Crean departed for the head job at Indiana, Buzz Williams was hired as the new head coach for the 2008–09 season, leading Marquette to a 25–10 record in and a second round loss to the Missouri Tigers in the 2009 NCAA tournament. He coached Marquette to a 22–12 record in the 2009–10 season, which ended with a close loss to the 11th-seeded Washington Huskies in the First Round of the 2010 NCAA tournament.\nDuring the 2010–11 campaign, Williams led the Golden Eagles back to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time since 2003. His team went 22–15 including a 9–9 Big East Conference record. They lost in the quarterfinals of the 2011 Big East men's basketball tournament to Louisville. Marquette received an at-large bid in the 2011 NCAA tournament. There they defeated Xavier in the second round (formerly the First Round) and Syracuse in the Third Round to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. In the Sweet Sixteen, they were defeated by No. 7-ranked and No. 2-seeded North Carolina. \nWiliams' 2012 team returned to the NCAA tournament after finishing second in the Big East regular season, finishing 14–4 in conference play. As a No. 3 seed in the NCAA tournament, they defeated BYU and Murray State to advance to their second straight Sweet Sixteen. There, they lost to No. 7-seeded Florida. \nAfter winning a share of the Big East Men's regular season championship, Marquette received an at-large bid in the 2013 NCAA tournament as a No. 3 seed. There, they earned come-from-behind victories over Davidson in the Second Round and Butler in the Third Round. In the Sweet Sixteen, the school's third straight under Williams, they defeated ACC regular season and conference champion Miami to earn a trip to Williams's first Elite Eight, where they lost to Syracuse. \nThe 2013–14 season was Williams' worst at Marquette, finishing 17–15 with a loss to Xavier in the Big East tournament.\nWojciechowski era.\nOn April 1, 2014, Steve Wojciechowski was hired as the new Marquette head basketball coach, replacing Buzz Williams, who left for Virginia Tech. \nBefore the 2014-15 season, Marquette lost several players, including Jamil Wilson and Davante Gardner. The team struggled mightily, finishing 13-19 overall and 4-14 in conference play, tying for last in the conference standings. After beating Seton Hall in the first round of the Big East Tournament, Marquette lost to Villanova in the quarterfinals. Marquette failed to qualify for any postseason tournament.\nThe 2015-16 campaign was highlighted by Henry Ellenson, a five-star recruit from Rice Lake, Wisconsin. Ellenson won the 2016 Big East Rookie of the Year award, and was named first-team All-Big East in his lone season in the NCAA. Besides Ellenson, Luke Fischer and Haanif Cheatham also played significant roles. The Golden Eagles finished the year 20-13, with an 8-10 record in the Big East, placing 7th in the conference. Marquette's season would come to an end after losing to Xavier in the quarterfinals of the 2016 Big East Tournament.\nAfter losing Ellenson to the NBA, Marquette reloaded with 3 four-star recruits joining the 2016-17 team, Markus Howard, Sam Hauser, and Brendan Bailey. Despite being picked to finish seventh in the Big East, Marquette finished the season tied for 3rd in the Big East, going 19–13 with a 10–8 record in the Big East. After losing to Seton Hall in the quarterfinals of the 2017 Big East Tournament, Marquette earned a 10 seed in the 2017 NCAA Tournament, their first appearance since 2013, but lost to eventual final four participants South Carolina.\nAfter losing Luke Fischer, JaJuan Johnson, and Haanif Cheatham, Marquette added four-star recruits Jamal Cain and Ike Eke, and three-star recruits Theo John and Greg Elliott for the 2017-18 season. The team failed to match the success of the previous season, finishing 21-14 with a 9–9 record in the Big East, tying for 6th in the conference. The team was headlined by Markus Howard, Sam Hauser, and Andrew Rowsey, with the three combining for 55 PPG during the season. After beating DePaul in the first round of the 2018 Big East Tournament, Marquette lost to eventual NCAA champion Villanova in the quarterfinals. Marquette qualified as a 2 seed for the 2018 NIT, beating Harvard and Oregon before losing to 4 seed Penn State in the quarterfinals.\nThe 2018-19 campaign saw the team's first season in the Fiserv Forum, leaving the Bradley Center, their home since 1988. The season would end up being the best season of Wojciechowski's tenure at Marquette. Although the team lost Andrew Rowsey, Marquette signed Joey Hauser, the younger brother of Sam. The team finished 24-10 with a 12–6 record in the Big East, placing 2nd in the conference. The team saw a remarkable season for Markus Howard, who averaged 25 PPG. Sam and Joey Hauser played supporting roles, along with Theo John and Sacar Anim. In February, Marquette ranked as high as 10 in the AP poll but lost 5 of their last 9 games of the regular season, including losing dropping 4 straight to close out the regular season. Marquette beat St. John's in the quarterfinals of the 2019 Big East Tournament, but lost to Seton Hall in the semifinals, by a score of 79-81. Marquette was picked as a 5 seed in the 2019 NCAA Tournament, where they matched up against Murray State, led by eventual second overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft, Ja Morant. Murray State dominated the entire game, upsetting Marquette 83-64.\nDespite high expectations for the 2019-20 season, the Hauser brothers would transfer out of the program in the offseason, hurting Marquette's chances to make it back to the NCAA tournament. Wojciechowski was able to successfully recruit Symir Torrence and Dexter Akanno, but the hole left by the Hausers was too great. While Markus Howard averaged 27.8 PPG for the season, becoming Marquette's all-time leading scorer in the process, the team finished with an 18-12 overall record, and an 8-10 record in the Big East, their worst Big East record since 2016. The team was slated to play Seton Hall in the 2020 Big East Tournament, but the tournament - and the entire season - was halted due to the outbreak of COVID-19.\nThe 2020-21 season was another disappointment for Marquette. With the departure of Markus Howard, the team struggled, going 13-14 overall, and 8-11 in the Big East. finishing 9th in the Big East. The incoming recruiting class looked promising however, with Dawson Garcia and Justin Lewis making an impact. Garcia stated all 27 games and averaged 13 points and 6.6 rebounds for the season, and Lewis averaging 7.8 points and 5.4 rebounds per game off the bench.\nOn March 19, 2021, it was announced that Marquette had fired Wojciechowski after seven seasons.\nSmart era.\nOn March 26, 2021, Marquette University hired Shaka Smart to replace Wojciechowski as the Golden Eagles head coach.\nAs Smart assumed control of the program, many players transferred out, including the promising Dawson Garcia, Theo John, Symir Torrence, Jamal Cain, and Koby McEwen. Additionally, D. J. Carton declared for the draft. Smart was able to land four key transfers to aid the team for the 2021-22 season: sophomores Olivier-Maxence Prosper from Clemson and Tyler Kolek from George Mason, along with graduate transfers Darryl Morsell from Maryland and Kur Kuath from Oklahoma. Smart was also able to obtain two four-star recruits from the class of 2021: Emarion Ellis and David Joplin, and three-star Keeyan Itejere, adding to the four-star and three-star that Wojciechowski recruited: Stevie Mitchell and Kam Jones.\nMarquette finished the season with a surprising 19-13 record, including an 11-8 record in the Big East, tying for 5th in the conference. The team was ranked as high as 18 before a late-season skid saw the team lose 5 of their last 9 regular season games. They faced Creighton in the 2022 Big East Tournament, but lost 74-63. The team was selected as a 9 seed in the 2022 NCAA Tournament, but lost to 8 seed North Carolina in the round of 64, 95-63.\nMarquette was projected to finish 9th in the Big East for the 2022-23 season, but surprised many with their best season in a decade. The team finished with a 29-7 record and won the Big East Regular Season and Tournament Titles, their first Big East Tournament win in program history. Marquette was selected as a 2 seed in the 2023 NCAA Tournament, beating 15 seed Vermont before losing to 7 seed Michigan State.\nMarquette came into the 2023-24 season with lofty expectations, despite losing Olivier-Maxence Prosper to the NBA. The team never fell below 17th in the AP Poll and finished 3rd in the Big East, with a 27-9 record. In the 2024 Big East Tournament, Marquette beat Villanova in the quarterfinal and Providence in the semifinal before losing to UConn in the final. They were again selected as a 2 seed in the 2024 NCAA Tournament, defeating 15 seed Western Kentucky and 10 seed Colorado en route to their first Sweet Sixteen berth since 2013 before losing to 11 seed NC State, 67-58.\nPostseason results.\nNCAA tournament.\nMarquette has appeared in the NCAA tournament 36 times. Their combined record is 44–37. They were National Champions in 1977.\nNIT.\nMarquette has appeared in the National Invitation Tournament 16 times. Their combined record is 23–15. In 1970, Marquette was ranked 8th and received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament. The NCAA slotted Marquette into the Midwest regional rather than the closer Mideast regional. Al McGuire was so displeased about this that Marquette actually turned down the NCAA bid and chose to instead play in the NIT, which they won. Marquette is the only university to spurn an NCAA tournament invite. The NCAA later instituted a rule which forbade an NCAA Division I men's basketball team from spurning an NCAA bid for an NIT bid. An antitrust case by the NIT ensued over this issue, and the NCAA settled out of court.\nNCIT.\nMarquette appeared in the last National Catholic Invitational Tournament in 1952 and won the NCIT championship.\nAwards and honors.\nCoaching.\nNational Coach of the Year\nHenry Iba Award\nGreat Midwest Conference Coach of the Year\nConference USA Coach of the Year\nBig East Conference Men's Basketball Coach of the Year\nIndividual.\nNational Player of the Year\nConsensus All-America First Team\nConsensus All-America Second Team\nGreat Midwest Conference Player of the Year\nConference USA Player of the Year\nBig East Conference Player of the Year\nBig East Conference Men's Basketball Sixth Man of the Year Award\nAll-Midwestern Collegiate Conference First Team\nAll-Great Midwest Conference First Team\nAll-Conference USA First Team\nAll-Big East Conference First Team\nHall of Fame inductees.\nNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\nNational Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame\nAll-time career leaders.\nLists are accurate through the 2019–20 season."

        "title": "1989 State of Origin series",
        "text": "The 1989 State of Origin series was the eighth time the annual three-game series between New South Wales and Queensland was contested entirely under 'state of origin' selection rules. It was Queensland's second consecutive Origin clean-sweep and an unpleasant inauguration for New South Wales' new coach Jack Gibson who, along with a new captain in Gavin Miller and eight new players, was brought into a dramatically overhauled Blues side that had lost its five last State of Origin matches.\nGame I.\nJack Gibson had never before coached at representative level and turned from Origin commentator to coach. He was pitted against his good friend and golfing buddy Arthur Beetson who had been recalled as Queensland coach to take over from Wayne Bennett. With experienced Blues Peter Sterling, Brett Kenny and Wayne Pearce all retired from representative football, New South Wales were forced to elevate some debutantes and only four players in game I of 1989 were in the squad from game III of 1988 - Garry Jack, John Ferguson, Des Hasler and Andrew Ettingshausen.\nQueensland's Michael Hancock became the youngest State of Origin footballer from either state that night. Hancock was one of four Maroons making their Origin debut in Game 1, the others being Kerrod Walters, Dan Stains and reserve forward Gary Coyne.\nGavin Miller had not represented for New South Wales since 1983 but was selected and posted as skipper. Canberra teenagers Laurie Daley and Bradley Clyde made their debut at the intimidating Lang Park \"Cauldron\", with Daley also handed the goal kicking duties despite the experienced Terry Lamb in the team at . Daley showed his nerves when missed his first shot on goal, a penalty from only 15 metres out from the posts and directly in front when Qld were leading 6–0. Also making their debut for NSW were Chris Johns, Mario Fenech, 1986 Kangaroo Tourist and World Cup final second rower Paul Sironen, and reserve forward Glenn Lazarus. Winger Johns, normally a centre with the Brisbane Broncos, made history by becoming the first player chosen to represent NSW Origin while playing for a Queensland-based club.\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe game seemed to start well for the Blues as Maroons winger Alan McIndoe knocked on fielding the kick off. From the scrum win NSW applied the pressure and forced a line drop out, but Qld quickly gained the upper hand. Wally Lewis put up a towering goal line drop out that landed some 8 metres on the Blues side of halfway and was let bounce by NSW fullback Garry Jack instead of catching the ball and putting the Blues back on the attack. Jack fielded the bouncing ball just inside his own quarter line allowing the Qld defence to trap NSW in their own half. From there things just went from bad to worse for NSW as Queensland seemed to make line breaks and score tries at will. Michael Hancock scored two tries in his Origin debut, while Mal Meninga signalled his return to representative football with two tries and four goals of his own. Also scoring for the Maroons were Langer, McIndoe and Bobby Lindner. However, on the night there was none better than Martin Bella whose powerhouse performance in the front row gave the likes of Wally Lewis and Allan Langer the room they needed and earned him the Man of the Match award.\nThe many Blues new faces were overwhelmed and suffered what was New South Wales' biggest losing margin: 30 points. Only a late try to reserve back Andrew Ettingshausen who grounded a kick from his Cronulla club mate Gavin Miller, prevented NSW from losing the game 36–0.\nGame II.\nQueensland wrapped up the 1989 series in game II in probably their most courageous effort in Origin history. They lost Allan Langer with a broken leg, Mal Meninga with a fractured eye socket and Paul Vautin with an elbow injury by half-time. In the second half, Michael Hancock came off with a bruised shoulder while Bob Lindner played on with a fracture in his ankle which he carried for much of the match before retiring five minutes from the end, leaving the Maroons down to 12 men.\nLindner, who stayed on the field despite his injury as there were no reserves left, claimed it was the toughest match in which he had played and Wally Lewis, who scored a memorable 40-metre try, rated it as Queensland's greatest performance. Maroon's coach Beetson was irate at the Blues' intimidating tactics, claiming New South Wales hard man Peter Kelly was allowed by referee Manson to get away with illegal tackling.\nThe day before the game, some NSW players entered Jack Gibson's hotel room to talk to him and were reportedly shocked to find their coach entertaining the enemy. In the room, long-time friends Gibson and Maroons coach Arthur Beetson were enjoying a drink and playing cards.\nDespite the 36-6 thrashing in Game 1, the NSW public got behind their team which resulted in a capacity crowd of 40,000 attending Game 2 at the Sydney Football Stadium. To date this was the second largest Sydney crowd in Origin history after the 42,048 that had attended Game 2 of the 1987 series at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\nGame III.\nThe first points came after Queensland hooker Kerrod Walters made a break from dummy half within his own half and passed on to his winger Alan McIndoe to run forty metres to score. Australian test winger Dale Shearer, who had moved from the bench to starting in the centres replacing the injured Mal Meninga and also took over the goal kicking duties despite the 1988 NSWRL season's top point scorer Gary Belcher playing at fullback, missed the sideline conversion attempt so the score remained 4 nil in favour of the Maroons. After collecting the ball from a scrum win within ten metres of Queensland's line, Blues halfback Greg Alexander dashed forth before passing it to his halves partner Des Hasler who dived over next to the uprights to equalize. Michael O'Connor made no mistake with the conversion and New South Wales were in front 6 - 4. The Maroons hit back when they got the ball after a Blues mistake and from over forty metres out, Michael Hagan kicked downfield for Shearer to beat the defence to and score in the left corner. Shearer missed this conversion as well so Queensland led 8 - 6. New South Wales responded with another try after lock forward Brad Mackay made a break about twenty metres out from Queensland's line before offloading in a tackle to Eastern Suburbs hooker David Trewhella coming through in support to score behind the posts. O'Connor's successful conversion put the score at 12 - 8 in favour of the Blues. New South Wales then crossed twice but were called back both times so the score remained unchanged for the half-time break.\nQueensland opened the scoring in the second half when Kerrod Walters again made a break from dummy half, running about forty metres before getting the ball out to support players, who passed on to a flying Michael Hancock to dive over in the left corner. Shearer's third conversion attempt was successful so Queensland had regained the lead at 14 - 12. Garry Jack fumbled as he stooped to pick up a Wally Lewis grubber and Walters dived on the loose ball to score the Maroons' next try. Shearer kicked the extras, giving Queensland a 20 - 12 lead. The Maroons' next try came after playing the ball over twenty metres out and keeping it alive, three players passing from tackles until it went to Gary Belcher who broke for the try-line and scored near the uprights. Shearer's kick was successful so Queensland led 26 - 12. The points kept coming for Queensland who started another movement from within their own half, putting the ball through the hands to players coming through in support until it made its way out to Tony Currie to dive over in the left corner. They didn't stop there though, with Shearer at dummy-half and in an attacking position passing the ball to Lewis before running around him to re-collect it and race through almost untouched to score again. Shearer then converted his own try and the score was 36 - 12."

It was organised by Brazilian sports agency Koch Tavares (one of the founding partners of Beach Soccer Worldwide). \nFor the first time since its establishment in 1995, the tournament took place outside of the sport's native home of Rio de Janeiro and instead was hosted at the resort of Costa do Sauipe, in the state of Bahia, approximately 70km north of the major city of Salvador.\nIt was also the first time that hosts and six-time defending champions Brazil did not win the championships, finishing in fourth, as Portugal beat France in the final to claim their first title.\nOrganisation.\nHaving increased the number of participating teams in 1999, these championships continued to consist of twelve nations who were split into four groups of three playing in a round robin format. The top two from each group advanced to the quarter-finals from which point on the championship was played as a knock-out tournament until a winner was crowned with an additional match to determine third place.\nThe draw for the allocation of the twelve nations into the four groups was conducted on January 14 in Villa-Lobos State Park in São Paulo.\nA representative of FIFA, Alfredo Asfura, attended the finals to assess the sport's premier event to understand the suitability of potentially incorporating beach soccer into the FIFA family. His post-competition analysis of the sport was that beach soccer was full of \"prosperity\" and that the \"experience, professionalism and seriousness of the organization [of the event] will be fundamental for FIFA\" in deciding where or not to adopt the sport in the future. FIFA ultimately took over as governing body of beach soccer in late 2004.\nRede Globo were responsible for broadcasting the games in Brazil, which caused controversy in Portuguese media when the network decided to show the third place play off involving the Brazil national team but subsequently not show the final.\nTeams.\nAsia, Africa and Oceania were unrepresented.\nEuropean Zone (6):\nNorth American Zone (1):\nSouth American Zone (4):\nHosts:\nGroup stage.\n\"Matches are listed as local time in Salvador, (BRST / UTC-2)\"\nKnockout stage.\nFebruary 16th was allocated as a rest day.\nThird place play-off.\nDaylight saving ended on the morning of the 18th.

Historically and currently, professional baseball season revolves around a schedule of series, each typically lasting three or four games. In college baseball, there are typically midweek single games and weekend series, with all conference games in series of three games, with the second and fourth rounds of the NCAA Division I playoffs being best two out of three game series. These series are often geographically grouped, allowing teams to visit adjacent cities conveniently. This is known in baseball as a road trip, and a team can be on the road for up to 20 games, or 4-5 series.\nWhen a team hosts series at home (mainly two-four consecutive series), it is called a homestand. During the Major League Baseball Postseason, there are four wild card series (two in each League), each of which are a best-of-3 series. The remainder of the Postseason consists of the League Division Series, which is a best-of-5 series, and the League Championship Series, which is a best-of-7 series, followed by the World Series, a best-of-7 series to determine the Major League Baseball Champion. The \"series\" schedule gives its name to the MLB championship series, the World Series. The record for the longest series was set in 1904, when the St. Louis Browns played the Detroit Tigers for 11 consecutive games."

        "text": "The 1985 State of Origin series was the fourth time the annual three-match series between New South Wales and Queensland was contested entirely under 'state of origin' selection rules. It was the year that New South Wales finally ended Queensland's dominance which had arisen with the State of Origin concept.\nGames.\nGame I.\nQueensland centre Gene Miles was ruled out of State of Origin due to a knee injury.\nHeavy rain confronted the players at Lang Park when the teams took the field for the opening match of the series, and it was thought players new to Origin football such as Michael O'Connor might struggle to cope with the conditions. However the former Wallaby displayed nerves of steel to complete one of Origin's most memorable debuts scoring two tries and kicking five goals to finish with all 18 of the Blues' points.\nThe relentless Blues defence led by Steve Roach, Pat Jarvis and Peter Wynn continually repelled the Maroons and helped keep the Blues line intact for the first time at Origin level. Five-eighth Brett Kenny earned wide praise for his efforts opposite Wally Lewis who was subjected to merciless pressure for almost the entire match. New coach Terry Fearnley and his captain Steve Mortimer had plotted for months to uncover a secret factor that would bring an end to the Maroons' Origin stranglehold. The strategy was to heap pressure on Lewis, Queensland's five-eighth and playmaker and the Blues carried out the plan perfectly.\nGame II.\nWith history possibly in the making a large New South Wales home crowd turned out in wet conditions at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The match was played on a knife's edge when after the Blues had taken a 12–0 lead with two tries after only 16 minutes, Queensland struck back in typical style and took a 14–12 lead despite having lost Bob Lindner and Colin Scott with serious injuries.\nThe New South Wales forwards relentlessly hurled themselves at the Queensland defence until cracks slowly began to appear. A penalty goal and then a sharply taken field goal by O'Connor gave the Blues a 15–14 lead and then when Lewis attempted to level the scores with his own field goal attempt eight minutes from the end, Mortimer flew from the ruck to charge down the kick.\nIt was the inspiration the Blues needed and when five-eighth Brett Kenny dashed over for the decisive try a minute from full-time, it sparked scenes of jubilation among the New South Wales players. Broadcast images that now form part of Origin folklore captured a rapturous Mortimer chaired from the field and then falling to the ground full of emotion and pride in the Blues' historic first series victory.\nGame III.\nQueensland took the field in Game III determined to avoid a whitewash but also smarting from a national selection controversy. Blues coach Terry Fearnley was also the Australian national coach and the match was played after the Australia v New Zealand Test series that year.

The Kiwis went on to win the third test 18–0, the first time the Australian's had been held scoreless in a test match since 1956.\nQueensland came out breathing fire and as the score mounted, late in the game Maroons forward Greg Dowling, one of the players axed by Fearnley, left the field replaced and stopped by the Blues bench to give Fearnley a passionate serve and tirade of abuse. Following this event ARL officials would legislate that the national coach never be a serving Origin coach to avoid the possibility of such embarrassing scenes or the potential for claims of bias.\nTeams.\nNew South Wales.\nWith the departure of Frank Stanton, Terry Fearnley was brought in to coach the New South Wales side.\nQueensland.\nWith the departure of Arthur Beetson, 1984 Brisbane Rugby League season-winning Wynnum Manly Seagulls coach, Des Morris was brought in to coach Queensland for the 1985 series."

UCF competes in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and as of the next college basketball season in 2023–24, the Big 12 Conference. The Knights play their home games in the Addition Financial Arena located on the university's main campus. They are coached by Johnny Dawkins who was hired in 2016.\nThe Knights have appeared in the NCAA Division II Tournament six times (1976, 1977, 1978, 1980, 1981, 1982), including the Final Four in 1978. UCF has reached the NCAA Division I Tournament five times (1994, 1996, 2004, 2005, and 2019). UCF has won seven regular season conference championships and five conference tournament championships.\nHistory.\nUCF played its first intercollegiate basketball game before the team even had a nickname. In the Division II era, under Torchy Clark, UCF found great success including a DII Final Four appearance. UCF has competed in the Atlantic Sun Conference (formerly called the Trans American Athletic Conference), from 1992 until 2005, when all sports joined Conference USA. Prior to 2013–14 all UCF sports joined the American Athletic Conference for its inaugural season. As a Division II team, the Knights had been a charter member of the Sunshine State Conference from 1975 to 1984. The Knights also had a brief one-year stint in the Sun Belt Conference.\nHead coaches.\nUCF has had seven head coaches since organized basketball began in 1969. The Knights have played nearly 1,200 games in their 44 seasons. In that time, four coaches have led the Knights to the postseason: Torchy Clark, Kirk Speraw, Donnie Jones, and Johnny Dawkins. Clark in 1976, 1977, 1978, 1980, 1981, and 1982, Speraw in 1994, 1996, 2004, and 2005, and Jones in 2011 and 2012. Clark is the only coach to successfully lead the Knights past the first round of the NCAA tournament, reaching the 1978 Final Four following a 24–game winning streak. Speraw is the longest tenured coach in program history at 17 seasons. Clark remains the winningest coach in school history with 274 wins in 14 seasons. Donnie Jones, who was hired in 2010 was fired by UCF on March 10, 2016. Johnny Dawkins, who was fired by Stanford, was hired on March 22, 2016. In Dawkins’ first season, he led the Knights the NIT semifinals at Madison Square Garden. In 2018–19, Dawkins’ UCF team earned the program's first at-large bid to the NCAA tournament and then won the program's first NCAA Tournament game, defeating VCU in the first round.\nClark era.\nEugene \"Torchy\" Clark, served as FTU's, then UCF's, first head basketball coach. In 1969, Clark, who was a Wisconsin high school coach, was responsible for starting the university's basketball program from scratch. The creation of the program had only been approved by the Florida Board of Regents five months prior to his hire. That year, as a club level team, the Knights went 11–3, including a 99–38 victory in their first game over Massey Tech. The first season would serve as an omen for UCF basketball, with Clark bringing the university unprecedented success as a Division II team. Roaming the sidelines for 14 seasons, Clark never had a losing season, and built UCF into a national power, bringing the Knights five Sunshine State Conference regular season championships, one conference tournament championship and six NCAA tournament appearances in eight years. In 1978, Clark led the Knights, which at the time were riding a 24–game winning streak, to the Final Four in Minnesota. During his tenure, the Knights were ranked in the top 10 nationally for seven consecutive years.\nClark earned Sunshine State Coach of the Year honors four times and won the conference's coach of the decade award. While at UCF, Clark coached both of his sons, Bo and Mike. All three men are members of the UCF Athletic Hall of Fame, and Clark is a member of the Sunshine State Conference Hall of Fame. Bo is the Knight's all-time leading scorer with Mike second on the list, and as a freshman in 1976 Bo was the nation's leading scorer. The father-son duo were featured in a 1979 Sports Illustrated issue.\nOn February 26, 1983, Clark coached his last game as a Knight, with UCF falling to Florida Southern. During his tenure, Clark's squads went 274–89 (.754), winning 20 or more games in a year on seven occasions. Clark enjoyed a 71–13 (.845) record in the Sunshine State Conference. In the decade after Clark retired, the Knights had only one winning season, the year after he left.\nLost decade: Machock, Carter and Dean.\nReplacing the legendary Torchy Clark would prove impossible for his successors. The three men that would replace him, went a combined 96–180 (.347) in 10 seasons, including only one season with a winning record. Hired to be Clark's replacement, Chuck Machock, an assistant coach at Ohio State, took the helm for the 1983–84 season. That year, Machock led the Knights to a 15–13 record, earning the team's sixth Sunshine State Conference regular season championship in their final year in the conference. The next year, UCF ascended to the ranks of Division I, earning a 10–18 record under Machock in what would be the Knights first losing season, and Machock's final season with the team. In two seasons, Machock led the Knights to a 25–31 (.446) record.\nFollowing their first losing season, the Knights hired Phil Carter. Carter would coach the Knights for four years, earning a 34–76 (.309) record. In his first year with the team, the Knights suffered a disappointing 6–22 record. The next year, Carter engineered one of the top improvements in the nation, leading UCF to a 12–15 campaign. From there the club would falter under his lead, earning 9 and 7 win seasons respectively. Carter finished his tenure without a winning season, manufacturing a 34–76 (.309) record.\nComing from Birmingham-Southern, coach Joe Dean replaced Carter. Dean led the Knights through a tumultuous four-year period, with two conference affiliation changes. In his second year with the team, UCF joined the American South Conference, the team's first affiliation since joining Division I. The next year the conference became the Sun Belt Conference, and the next year the Knights joined the Atlantic Sun Conference. In 1991, the Knights moved from their original home-court, which was in the education building, to their new court inside what's now known as \"The Venue\" In their last game in the education gymnasium, the team lost to Louisiana-Lafayette 85–94 on February 23, 1991. On November 30, 1991, the Knights posted an 82–74 victory over Campbell in their first game in the new arena. In his four seasons with the Knights, Dean earned a 37–73 (.336) record. Like his predecessor, Dean did not enjoy a single winning season during his tenure.\nSperaw era.\nFollowing the departure of Joe Dean, on July 28, 1993, Kirk Speraw, an assistant coach at Florida, was hired as the Knights new head coach. During his 17-year tenure, Speraw led the Knights to four Atlantic Sun Conference tournament champions, one regular season championship, and their first four NCAA tournament appearances (94, 96, 04, 05).\nWhen Speraw took the helm in 1993, UCF had only one winning season since Torchy Clark left a decade earlier. In his first year with the team, Speraw led the Knights to an 11-game turnaround (21–9), earning the team their first Division I NCAA Tournament Appearance. After a down 1994–1995 season, Speraw once again led the Knights to an NCAA Tournament appearance in 1996 despite their 8–18 regular season record (tied for the worst regular season record of any NCAA Division I Tournament team ever) after winning the TAAC Tournament as massive underdogs, their second NCAA Tournament appearance in his first three years. In the team's last two years in the Atlantic Sun Conference, the Knights won both the 2004 and 2005 conference tournaments, and were the 2005 regular season champions as well. Despite their success, the Knights have never progressed past the first round of the NCAA tournament as a Division I team. UCF made its debut in Conference USA in 2005, and the team earned a berth in the Conference USA Championship Tournament in their first year. The Knights would fall to Houston in the second round and close out the season with the program's first losing record (14–15) since 2000–2001. The Knights made a huge turnaround in the 2006–07 season, finishing 2nd in conference play to Memphis with an overall record of 22–9. Speraw won 2007 Conference USA Coach of the Year honors.\nThe Knights would play their first game in the new UCF Arena on November 3, 2007, an 86–78 win over the Saint Leo Lions. In their first regular-season game in the new arena, the Knights would win 63–60 over the Nevada Wolf Pack, on November 11, 2007. In thrilling fashion, the Knights defeated the Tulsa Golden Hurricane in triple overtime 97–91 in front of an announced crowd of 7,097, in their first home C-USA game in the arena on January 11, 2008. In what would be his final season with the team, on February 2, 2010, the Knights defeated the East Carolina Pirates 67–56, earning Speraw his 275th win at UCF, passing Torchy Clark as the winningest coach in program history.\nFollowing a disappointing 2009–10 season in which the Knights went 15–17, the university decided not to retain Kirk Speraw bringing an end to his 17-year tenure. Speraw garnered a school-high 279 wins (on 233 losses–.544), including 118–90 (.567) in the Atlantic Sun and 40–38 (.512) in Conference USA.\nJones era.\nOn March 30, 2010, UCF announced Donnie Jones as the university's new Men's Basketball Head Coach. On December 1, 2010, the Knights upset the #16 Florida Gators 57–54 giving the Knights their first victory over a top 20 opponent as well as their first victory over the Gators. Following a 10–0 start to the 2010–11 season, the Knights were nationally ranked for the first time in program history at the Division I level. At the time, UCF was one of nine unbeaten teams, and one of only four schools to be ranked in the BCS standings and the AP basketball poll. The Knights would continue to start the season 14–0, their best start since moving to Division I, ranking as high as #18, and would open conference play with a defeat of Jones' former team, the Marshall Thundering Herd. UCF would finish the season 21–12 (6–10), with an appearance in the College Basketball Invitational.\nJones led the Knights to the biggest win in program history, when on November 25, 2011 they defeated the defending national champions and then-ranked #4 Connecticut Huskies 68–63 in the inaugural Battle 4 Atlantis tournament. Jones would lead the Knights to a 22–11 record in 2012, including the programs first ever NIT berth.\nRecruiting scandal.\nFollowing an investigation into recruiting violations in the men's basketball program in 2011, on July 31, 2012, the NCAA announced sanctions – in addition to penalties UCF self-imposed. The NCAA imposed a one-year postseason ban on the program. The penalty is in addition to a $50,000 fine, adding two years to UCF's previously proposed three years' probation, reduction of basketball scholarships, and the vacating of 53 basketball victories for three seasons in which there was an ineligible player. Despite the sanctions, Jones led the Knights to their third consecutive twenty-win season in 2013 with a 20–11 record. Jones was fired on March 10, 2016, leaving with a 100–88 record at UCF.\nDawkins era.\nFormer Stanford coach Johnny Dawkins replaced Jones as head coach on March 22, 2016.\nThe Knights made it back to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2005 during the 2018–2019 season after going 24–8, which included an upset win over #9 Houston breaking their 33-game home winning streak. UCF won its first NCAA Tournament game on March 22, 2019 by beating VCU in the first round.\nPostseason results.\nNCAA Division I tournament results.\nThe Knights have appeared in five NCAA Division I Tournaments. Their combined record is 1–5.\nNCAA Division II tournament results.\nThe Knights appeared in the NCAA Division II Tournament six times. Their combined record was 6–9.\nNIT results.\nThe Knights have appeared in three National Invitation Tournament (NIT). Their combined record is 4–3.\nCBI results.\nThe Knights have appeared in one College Basketball Invitational (CBI). Their record is 2–1.\nHome courts.\nThe Knights have taken the hardwood in three venues, all of which are still standing on UCF's main campus.\nThe Knight's first permanent home was in the College of Education's gymnasium. Seating under 1,000, this court served the team for over 20 years. The UCF Arena, now known as the Venue, broke ground in 1990 and opened for play in 1991. The Knights played their final season in the venue in 2007, going 15–1 at home only losing to the Elite Eight bound Memphis Tigers. The final game saw UCF defeating East Carolina 77–64 in front of 3,725 people. UCF averaged a then-school record 2,706 average attendance during the season.\nUCF moved into its new home for the 2007–2008 season, the 10,000 seat CFE Arena. The Knights opened up their new arena against the reigning Western Athletic Conference champion Nevada Wolf Pack on November 11, 2007 in front of a crowd of 4,668. The attendance record in the new Arena is 10,011, which was against the Illinois Fighting Illini.\nTraditions.\nKnightmare.\nWhen the basketball program moved into the New UCF Arena in the fall of 2007, the facility could hold more students than ever before. To go along with its new facility and its new commitment to basketball, a new student section was formed. The \"Knightmare\" debuted on January 11, 2008. Adorned in their black Knightmare shirts, the students completely filled the bleachered section behind the basket and the overflow section in the upper deck. In what will go down as one of the greatest basketball games in UCF basketball history, the Knights defeated Tulsa 97–91 in triple overtime in front of a then-record crowd of 7,097 fans.\nOne of UCF's most unusual basketball traditions is its free throw chant. Started by the \"Kirk's Jerks\" in the 1990s, UCF fans started holding their right arms with clenched fists almost straight up when a UCF player shoots a free throw. When the basketball is made, the fans would stomp their right foot twice, clap their hands twice, make a shooting motion with their right hand while chanting \"woosh.\" In the more recent years, after the appropriately named Stomp Stomp, Clap Clap, Woosh chant, fans will chant U-C-F afterwards, making a U, a C, and an F over their heads. During the 2010–2011 season, a group of students attempted to start a new tradition; if a UCF player makes all of his free throws, the chant is followed by \"ballin'.\""

        "text": "John Vitale (December 28, 1965 – July 9, 2000) was an American football player. He played college football as a center and offensive guard for the University of Michigan from 1985 to 1988. He was selected as a consensus All-American center in 1988. He later played professional football for the San Antonio Riders of the World League of American Football (WLAF) in 1991 and the Detroit Drive of the Arena Football League (AFL) from 1993 to 1994.\nEarly years.\nA Detroit native, Vitale was born in 1965 and attended De La Salle Collegiate High School in Warren, Michigan.\nUniversity of Michigan.\nVitale enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1984 and played college football for head coach Bo Schembechler's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1985 to 1988. After redshirting in 1984, Vitale started nine games at left offensive guard for the 1985 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled a 10-1-1 record, defeated Nebraska in the 1986 Fiesta Bowl, and finished the season ranked #2 in the AP Poll.\nAs a sophomore, Vitale was converted to the center position and started all 13 games at that position for the 1986 Michigan team that compiled an 11-2 record and was ranked #8 in the final AP Poll. As a junior, he again started every game at center for the 1987 Michigan team and was selected as a first-team All-Big Ten Conference player. In his senior year, he started every game for Michigan, completing a streak of 37 consecutive games as Michigan's starting center. He also served as a co-captain of the 1988 Michigan team that compiled a 9-2-1 record, defeated USC 22-14 in the 1989 Rose Bowl, and was ranked #4 in the final AP Poll. At the end of the 1988 season, Vitale was selected as the consensus first-team center on the 1988 College Football All-America Team.\nVitale was also known as a team leader who once showed up with a U-M winged football helmet design shaved into the side of his head. Vitale had a close relationship with his head coach, Bo Schembechler. Sportswriter Mitch Albom wrote about the following exchange between Vitale and Bo Schembechler. \"You gonna work us today, Chief?\" Vitale would ask. 'I'm gonna kick your butt,\" Schembechler would say. \"Good,\" Vitale would answer.\nProfessional football.\nVitale was not selected in the 1989 NFL Draft but attended training camp with the Houston Oilers. A recurring back injury prevented him from playing successfully in the National Football League (NFL). He did play for the San Antonio Riders of the World League of American Football in 1991 and the Detroit Drive of the Arena Football League from 1993 to 1994.\nLater years.\nAfter his playing career ended, Vitale worked for Wolverine Human Services. His final position was as the director of a community center on the east side of Detroit that was later renamed the John S. Vitale Community Center in his honor.\nVitale was diagnosed with ependymoma, cancer of the spinal cord, in 1994 at age 29. He married Lynn Abdelnour in 1998. In 1999, he found the cancer had returned and he started aggressive chemotherapy treatments. When his father told him that the cancer had spread to his brain, Vitale said, \"Well, this sucks.\" According to sports columnist Mitch Albom, \"those were the only negative words anyone heard him say.\" He died at age 34 in Grosse Pointe, Michigan."

Hill went on to be the season's leading runscorer with 620 @ 103.33. The leading wicket-takers with 20 apiece were Jack Saunders @ 17.13 (BB 6/70) and Joe Travers @ 20.75 (BB 9/30).\nWhen South Africa toured in 1910–11, Australia relied on the outstanding bowling of Bill Whitty who was the season's leading wicket-taker with 70 wickets @ 20.27 (BB 6/17).

They owed the victory to team captain Dan Reese who took 7–53 in Queensland's first innings.\nNew Zealand lost to both New South Wales and Victoria by an innings but managed a draw against South Australia."

        "text": "The Indonesia national rugby union team represents Indonesia in rugby union. They are nicknamed the \"Rhinos\". The team is a full member of World Rugby. They have yet to play in the Rugby World Cup. The Indonesian squad was formed in 2006 to attend the IRB sanctioned Six Division Asian Rugby Football Tournament between Brunei, Laos, Cambodia and Indonesia. They currently compete in Division 3 South-East in the Asian Rugby Football Union.\nThe national side is ranked 100th in the world (as of 6 June 2021).\nHistory.\nEarly Years (1975-1986).\nRugby was first introduced in Indonesia during the Dutch colonial period, and was played mostly by ex-pats. In March 1976 an Indonesian Sevens squad, alongside twelve other nations, participated in the inaugural Hong Kong Sevens tournament. Indonesia returned to Hong Kong again for the 1976 tournament where they lost to Tonga in the plate final. Indonesia continued to participate in the tournament until 1986 after which, interest began to wane and the program went on hiatus.\nARFU Division 6 (2004-2008).\nIn the early to mid 2000s, rugby made a resurgence in Indonesia. In 2004, the Indonesian Rugby Football Union was formed and on 27 June 2006 the first ever Indonesian XVs game was played against Cambodia during the first Division 6 ARFU regional tournament in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Indonesia would lose their début test match 30-7. In 2007, Singapore rugby's Ismail Kadir and Justin Sampson took over coaching duties. Later that year, the Rhinos returned once again to the Asian Division 6 Championships in Brunei, recording wins against Laos 17-3 and Cambodia 11-10. Indonesia then went on to defeat tournament hosts Brunei 28-13, taking home the series as well as the Darussalam Cup.\nIn July 2008, the Rhinos won the HSBC a5n Regional Tournament, which was played at the Universitas Pelita Harapan, Jakarta, Indonesia. The Rhinos defeated Laos 23-11 and Cambodia 55-3 in front of an appreciative home crowd. The Rhinos finished their time in ARFU Division 6 with an impressive 88% Win–loss record (7 wins, 1 loss), thus earning a promotion Division 3.\nARFU Division 3 (2009- present).\nIn 2009, Indonesia's coaching staff of Kadir and Sampson was expanded to include former Wallabies player \nDuncan Hall, who had previously held the head coaching job for the USA national team. In July 2009, Indonesia made their debut in Division 3 at the 2009 Asian Five Nations. In the tournament, the Rhinos recorded two consecutive losses, falling 3-23 to Guam and 13-48 to Iran.\nIn the years that followed, Indonesia would lose three more matches in the upper tier division before finally posting their first win on 25 June 2011 against Pakistan 20-19 during the 2011 A5N divisional series in Jakarta.\n Following that win, Indonesia went on to win two of its next four matches, including a thumping win over China 37-13 in Malaysia in 2014. A year later, the Rhinos would face China a second time in the 2014 A5n opener, losing a highly contested match by a four-point differential. Two days later, an 11-10 win against Laos would secure a third-place finish in the series.\nIn 2015, the rebranded Asia Rugby Championship returned once again to Jakarta where Indonesia faced Guam in the series opener. This would mark Indonesia's first match at home since they defeated Pakistan three years prior. The Rhinos would go winless in the series, first losing the opener to Guam and later China. In 2016 Indonesia would play just one test match against Loas, losing by a large margin, 12-48.\nIn 2019, the IRFU named former Rhinos veteran and captain Bobby Orlando as head coach for the 2019 Asia Rugby Championship series where Indonesia competed in the newly formed Division 3 South-East division along with India and China. On June 23, Indonesia fell in the tournament opener to a strong Chinese side 63—10, with the Rhino's lone try coming from veteran captain Daniel Nugroho.\nCurrent squad.\n2019 Asia Rugby Championships roster"

        "text": "These are the official results of the Men's 5,000 metres event at the 1990 European Championships in Split, Yugoslavia, held at Stadion Poljud on 30 August and 1 September 1990.\nResults.\nFinal.\n1 September\nItaly's Salvatore Antibo, who was the strongest pre-race favourite to win also this final, having taken the 10,000-metre European title with a solo run, fell at the start, and therefore had to run faster than the other runners for the first 700 metres, in order to catch them. Portugal's Domingos Castro first led the race, but soon thereafter France's Cyrille Laventure took the lead. Laventure was still leading the race at 3,000 metres in 8:09.15, and at 4,000 metres in 10:53.34. Despite the moderate pace, almost all runners were still in the lead group at this point. On the second last back straight, Castro accelerated past Laventure into the lead, and the main group's runners started to string out. Castro was still leading the race at 4,600 metres, in an informal time of 12:26.2 or 12:26.3. Antibo, Britain's Gary Staines, Poland's Slawomir Majusiak, Laventure, and Finland's Risto Ulmala were chasing Castro. On the final back straight, Staines tried to sprint past Antibo, who accelerated into the lead, leaving Castro behind. At the start of the final bend, Staines sprinted past Antibo. In the second half of the bend, however, Antibo furiously kicked past Staines. Some metres behind the leading duo, Majusiak accelerated past the fading Castro. Several metres behind the second pair of runners, Sweden's Jonny Danielsson passed Ulmala. Despite celebrating his victory in the final metres, Antibo defeated Staines by almost half a second, while Majusiak secured the bronze medal. Danielsson ran the home straight several metres faster than the exhausted Castro, but he still lost to the tiny Portuguese runner by under 0.2 seconds.

        "title": "2009 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 2009 Tour de France was the 96th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It started on 4 July in the principality of Monaco with a individual time trial which included a section of the Circuit de Monaco. The race visited six countries: Monaco, France, Spain, Andorra, Switzerland and Italy, and finished on 26 July on the Champs-Élysées in Paris.\nThe total length was , including in time-trials. There were seven mountain stages, three of which had mountaintop finishes, and one medium-mountain stage. The race had a team time trial for the first time since 2005, the shortest distance in individual time trials since 1967, and the first penultimate-day mountain stage in the Tour's history.\n2007 winner Alberto Contador won the race by a margin of 4′11″, having won both a mountain and time trial stage. His team also took the team classification. and supplied the initial third-place finisher, Lance Armstrong. Armstrong's achievement was later voided by the UCI in October 2012 following his non-dispute of a doping accusation by USADA, and fourth place Bradley Wiggins was promoted to the podium. Andy Schleck, second overall, won the young riders' competition as he had the previous year. Franco Pellizotti originally won the polka dot jersey as the King of the Mountains, but had that result (along with all his 2009 results) stripped by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in 2011 due to his irregular values in the UCI's biological passport program detected in May 2010. and the King of the Mountains title was retroactively awarded to Egoi Martínez. Mark Cavendish won six stages, including the final stage on the Champs-Élysées, but was beaten in the points classification by Thor Hushovd, who consequently won the green jersey.\nTeams.\n20 teams were invited to take part in the race. They include 17 of the 18 UCI ProTour teams (all except for ) and three other teams: , and . Each team started with 9 riders, making a total of 180 participants, of whom 156 finished.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nUCI ProTour teams\nInvited teams\nPre-race favourites.\nFavourites for the race included 2008 winner Carlos Sastre, 2007 winner Alberto Contador, 2009 Giro d'Italia winner Denis Menchov and two time runner-up Cadel Evans. Lance Armstrong came out of retirement and competed in the race on the same team as Contador. Menchov and Evans performed far below the levels expected of them, finishing 51st and 30th respectively, and Sastre only showed briefly among the leaders on the mountain stages that would have provided his best chance of making a bid for victory, coming 17th overall.\nAlejandro Valverde, the team leader of , was not selected by his team for the Tour de France, because the race travelled through Italy on stage 16 and he had received a ban in May 2009 from the Italian Olympic Committee, prohibiting him from competing in Italy. He had finished in the top ten of the general classification of the Tour in the two previous years and was considered one of the favourites for overall victory.\nNews about a positive retest of a 2007 out-of-competition control concerning Thomas Dekker broke three days before the start; his team immediately withdrew him from the starting list.\nRoute and stages.\nThe highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Grand Saint-Bernard mountain pass on stage 16.\nRace overview.\nThe race started in Monaco with a individual time trial, won by Olympic time trial champion Fabian Cancellara, who retained the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification throughout the first week, which was dominated by stages suited primarily to sprinters, with Mark Cavendish establishing himself as the strongest finisher. The significant action of the first week in relation to the overall classification was restricted to a split in the field on stage 3, and a team time trial the following day.\nThe second weekend saw the Tour in the Pyrenees, and the first attack on the field by eventual winner Alberto Contador, while the leadership was taken over by Rinaldo Nocentini. Thor Hushovd showed an ability to take points in stages that did not include flat sprint finishes that would be key to the contest for the points classification, and the main contenders for the mountains classification emerged. The journey towards the Alps the following week had a second pair of successive stage wins for Cavendish and a series of wins from riders in breakaways that held no threat to the general classification. An infringement in the sprint finish to stage 14 saw Cavendish relegated in finishing position, and Hushovd gaining the upper hand in the points classification.\nThe first alpine stage was the occasion of Contador's assumption of the race leadership, and the emergence of Andy Schleck as the only rider likely to challenge him in the mountains, and as the top young rider, giving Schleck the right to wear the white jersey. Franco Pellizotti focussed on collecting points on the climbs early in stages to overhaul Egoi Martínez in the race for the mountains classification, without threatening the race leaders. By the end of the three stages in the Alps, and after Contador's victory in the final time trial, it was only the minor placings that were realistically under question in the last mountain stage, held for the first time on the penultimate day of the tour on Mont Ventoux.\nThe UCI introduced a ban on radio communication between team management and riders on stage 10, but the riders responded with a conservative style of racing for most of the stage and the intended repetition of the experiment on stage 13 was abandoned.\nMark Cavendish claimed his sixth Champs-Élysées stage win on the final day of the Tour. At the victory ceremony, the national anthem of Denmark was mistakenly played instead of that of Spain. At the victory ceremony for teams, the anthem of Spain was yet played, because Contador was part of the winning team, Astana.\nDoping.\nIn the 2009 Tour, Doping controls were conducted by the UCI, with the French body AFLD shadowing the process. Officials targeted top riders like Lance Armstrong and Alberto Contador with an unprecedented number of tests. While the Armstrong-Contador conflict ruled the headlines, reporting on doping rather took a back seat during the race. The news that Giro runner-up Danilo Di Luca had a positive A probe in the Giro did not change that. Five days after the race finished the UCI announced that the initial Stage 16 winner Mikel Astarloza tested positive for EPO in an out-of-competition test on 26 June, eight days before the race started. Later, Astarloza was removed from the results, and the stage win transferred to Sandy Casar.\nJust days before the 2010 Giro d'Italia, 2009 Giro podium finisher and King of the Mountains winner in this Tour Franco Pellizotti was announced by the UCI as a rider of interest in their biological passport program. He was sidelined by his team, and did not race again in 2010. The case was not fully resolved until March 2011, at which time the Court of Arbitration for Sport ordered Pellizotti banned for two years, to pay a fine and court costs, and have all his 2009 results vacated.\nIn October 2012, Lance Armstrong had all his results post 1998, including the 2009 Tour, voided by the UCI following the USADA investigation into systematic doping.\nOn 10 July 2014, a UCI press release detailing various athlete sanctions specified that Menchov had been banned (for a period of two years) until 9 April 2015 due to adverse biological passport findings. Due to this, he has been disqualified from the 2009, 2010 and 2012 Tours de France.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were four main individual classifications contested in the 2009 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. There were no time bonuses given at the end of stages for this edition of the Tour. If a crash had happened within the final of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing in the highest positions in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type. The leader was identified by a green jersey.\nThe third classification was the mountains classification. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and \"hors catégorie\", with the more difficult climbs rated lower. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\nThe final individual classification was the young rider classification. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1984. The leader wore a white jersey.\nThe final classification was a team classification. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie. The riders in the team that lead this classification were identified with yellow number bibs on the back of their jerseys.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass start stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \"made the greatest effort and who has demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship\". The winner wore a red number bib the following stage. At the conclusion of the Tour, Franco Pellizotti was given the overall super-combativity award.\nThere were also two special awards each with a prize of €5000, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given in honour of Tour founder and first race director Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Grand-Saint-Bernard on stage 16, and the Souvenir Jacques Goddet, given in honour of the second director Jacques Goddet to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Tourmalet on stage 9. Franco Pellizotti won both the Henri Desgrange and the Jacques Goddet.\nWorld rankings.\nThe following points were earned in the Tour towards the 2009 UCI World Ranking."

        "title": "2006–07 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2006–07 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team represented the University of Kansas Jayhawks for the NCAA Division I men's intercollegiate basketball season of 2006–07. The team was led by Bill Self in his fourth season as head coach. The team played its home games in Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence, Kansas.\nThe Jayhawks' won the regular season championship with fourteen conference wins—the third straight season in which the team has claimed a share of the championship. In postseason play the team defeated its conference opponents to claim its second straight title. In the NCAA Division I tournament, the Jayhawks were defeated in the Elite Eight.\nSeason Synopsis.\nAfter returning every key player from the 2006 team that shared the Big 12 regular season title with the Texas Longhorns and defeated Texas for the conference tournament title, the Jayhawks expected to repeat as Big 12 champs and contend for the national title in 2006–07. ESPN's Andy Katz had ranked the Jayhawks as the second best team in the nation for the preseason, while Dick Vitale had the Jayhawks ranked third. The starting lineup included Russell Robinson (guard), Mario Chalmers (guard), Brandon Rush (small forward), Julian Wright (power/small forward), and Sasha Kaun (Center). Darrell Arthur and Sherron Collins were the nucleus of Bill Self's recruiting class for the 06–07 season and provided valuable minutes coming off the bench. Some key returnees included Darnell Jackson and Jeremy Case.\nOne early-season casualty was C.J. Giles. He was suspended in early November for failure to attend practices, for poor showing in the classroom, and because of unpaid child support. He was to have been reinstated for the Winston-Salem State game, but another incident involving charges of assault and battery against his ex-girlfriend left Bill Self with no choice but to dismiss the troubled center from the team. Giles transferred to play for the Oregon State Beavers. His problems, however, persisted to a degree that he was dismissed from OSU in January 2008.\nFollowing the victory over #1 ranked and defending National Champion Florida in Las Vegas, athletic director Lew Perkins announced that he had extended Coach Bill Self's contract through 2011.\nUntil February 3, no team from the Big 12 South division had ever beaten Kansas in Allen Fieldhouse since the conference's formation in the 1996 offseason. That streak came to an end when Texas A&amp;M came from 11 down to beat KU 69–66; this also marked the first time ever that the Aggies had beaten the Jayhawks. As it turned out, that would be the last time until 2011 that anyone would beat the Jayhawks in Allen Fieldhouse, as KU would go on to post a school and conference record 69-game homecourt winning streak.\nThere were two streaks that remained intact. Kansas extended its streak of consecutive home wins against Colorado to 24 with a 97–74 victory on January 27, 2007. KU also maintained the 24-game on-the-road win streak against Kansas State in Manhattan with a 71–62 victory in Bramlage Coliseum on February 19, 2007. KU won the final five games with KSU in Ahearn Fieldhouse and the first 19 meetings in Bramlage through 2007.\nKansas won the 2007 regular season Big 12 championship, finishing in first place with a 14–2 record in conference play. In doing so, they clinched their third straight regular season title and their first outright Big 12 title since 2003, having settled for ties with Oklahoma and Texas the previous two seasons. They came from down 16 against Texas to win 90–86, leading by as many as 10 at one point and holding on for the four-point win. The title is the Jayhawks' 50th all-time since joining the Missouri Valley Conference in 1907–08. It is also KU's fifth outright Big 12 championship and seventh overall.\nThe outright title gave Kansas the top seed for the Big 12 Tournament and a bye for the preliminary rounds of play. In the quarterfinal, KU faced ninth-seed Oklahoma and prevailed 64–47. In the semifinal, KU faced fourth-seed Kansas State and prevailed 67–61. Finally, in the title game, KU defeated Texas 88–84 in overtime to win the Big 12 Tournament. They pulled off an even bigger comeback than in the regular-season meeting, coming from down 22 to win. The 22-point comeback is the biggest in KU history, eclipsing the 19-point comeback in an 85–70 win over UCLA in 1995.\nKansas earned the top seed for the West Region of the 2007 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. In subregional action at the United Center in Chicago, KU defeated Niagara 107–67 and Kentucky 88–76.\nIn the Sweet 16, KU escaped a tough defensive stance from Southern Illinois, winning 61–58 at HP Pavilion in San Jose, California. The victory sent KU to the Elite Eight against the second-seeded UCLA Bruins, but they lost 68–55, their largest margin of defeat all season. KU has never won a game against UCLA in NCAA Tournament play, losing all five meetings. The loss also left Bill Self at 0–4 all-time in Elite Eight games, having lost with Tulsa, Illinois, and Kansas (twice), a problem he eliminated the following season.\nKansas finished the season 33–5, winning the Big 12 regular-season and postseason championships, reaching the Elite Eight, and achieving the seventh 30-win season in school history.\nOn April 9, 2007, sophomore forward Julian Wright announced that he would forgo his junior and senior seasons, hire an agent (therefore forfeiting his amateur status and college eligibility), and enter his name into the NBA draft. Teammate and fellow sophomore Brandon Rush had originally chosen to follow suit, announcing on April 26, 2007 his plan of entering his name into the NBA draft, but decided to not hire an agent (therefore allowing him to return to KU if he decided to withdraw his name from the draft). However, after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament in a pickup game of basketball, Rush changed his mind and decided to return for his junior season at KU. Rush's surgery was successful; and, as it turned out the following season, the injury was a blessing in disguise for Rush and the Jayhawks.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9| Exhibition\n!colspan=9| Regular season\n!colspan=9| Big 12 tournament\n!colspan=9| NCAA tournament"

He played almost 50 games for the Everblades but managed just 13 points. He also played at the higher AHL level for the Lowell Lock Monsters on nine occasions but failed to score a single point.\nFor the 2003–04 season, Battaglia would sign for another ECHL organization, the Mississippi Sea Wolves. Battaglia settled well, and in his first season made 67 regular season appearances, scoring 37 points. He was also featured in the post-season and was one of the Sea Wolves' most reliable players, with 6 points in five games. He remained in Mississippi for the 2004–05 season. In 75 games, Battaglia scored 60 points. Battaglia also played with his brother Bates Battaglia, who signed with the Sea Wolves during the 2004–05 NHL lockout. The Sea Wolves suspended operations in the middle of the off-season because of Hurricane Katrina.\nBattaglia remained in the ECHL but split the 2005–06 season between the Utah Grizzlies and the Augusta Lynx. Despite the lack of consistency, Battaglia managed to maintain his level of play, and in 72 games for the two teams, scored 54 points. Battaglia would again move teams in the off-season, signing for the Columbia Inferno. He scored 45 points in 47 games, leading to a mid-season move in March 2007 to the Manchester Phoenix. He scored 13 points in the 13 games he was featured in before the season ended. Battaglia returned to North America and re-signed for the Inferno, and once again became an important player for the organization. In March 2008, Battaglia was part of a five-player swap, which sent him again to the Augusta Lynx. On September 4, 2008, his move to the Mississippi Sea Wolves was confirmed. For the 2009–10 season, Battaglia played with the Amarillo Gorillas of the Central Hockey League.\nOn August 24, 2010, Battaglia signed with the Mississippi RiverKings, to remain in the Central Hockey League. After playing in 16 games with the RiverKings to start the 2010–11 season, Battaglia was released and signed with fellow CHL team the Tulsa Oilers on December 24, 2010. For the 2011–12 season, Battaglia moved to the Federal Hockey League, playing for the New Jersey Outlaws. He followed the franchise to Williamsport, Pennsylvania, for the 2012–13, playing with team until it folded on January 21, 2013. He then joined the Huntsville Havoc of the Southern Professional Hockey League. Battaglia played in the Federal Hockey League for the Dayton Demonz.\nHe ended his career with the Mississippi Surge of the Southern Professional Hockey League and retired on February 18, 2014.\nAfter retiring from hockey, Battaglia has operated a bar and worked as a fireman in Raleigh, North Carolina.\nPersonal life.\nAnthony and his brother Bates competed in and won \"The Amazing Race\" 22."

        "title": "Michael White (snooker player)",
        "text": "Michael White (born 5 July 1991) is a Welsh professional snooker player from Neath, Glamorgan. Nicknamed ‘Lightning’ due to his fast playing style, White is a former top 16 player and two-time ranking event winner.\nA highly rated junior, he became the youngest player to have made a century break in competitive play aged 9, and won the World Amateur Championship at 14. White won his first ranking event at the 2015 Indian Open, before breaking into the top 16 during the 2015-16 season and capturing his second ranking title at the 2017 Paul Hunter Classic.\nWhite's form started to decline in the 2018-19 season however, eventually leading to him dropping off the professional tour in 2020. He regained his tour card in 2022 by qualifying for the 2022 World Snooker Championship, becoming only the second amateur ever to qualify for the tournament in the process.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nWhite first showed potential by becoming the youngest player to make a century break: a 105 in March 2001, when aged nine. In 2001, he was invited to the Crucible, where John Parrott commented: 'I hope I've retired before I have to play him!'\nHe won a number of junior and later amateur events, and in 2006 became the youngest ever winner of the IBSF World Grand Prix, winning it aged 14. He also won the European under-19 Championship, beating Vincent Muldoon in the final. \nHe turned professional for the 2007–08 season, but he was not allowed to play in the first ranking event of the season, the 2007 Shanghai Masters as it fell short of his 16th birthday which allowed his opponent Lee Walker a walkover. Previously Shaun Murphy had been allowed to play aged 15.\nTurning professional.\nIn his first professional match, the Masters qualifying, he shocked Leicester player Tom Ford 4–0, however he lost to eventual champion Barry Hawkins 5–2 in the following round.\nHis first season on the Main Tour was relatively unsuccessful, winning only four matches in the seven ranking events.\nIn his first ranking tournament, the Grand Prix, he finished last in his group, beating Tony Drago but losing his other 6 matches. His most successful run was beating Shailesh Jogia 10–4 in the first round of the World Championship qualifiers, but he lost 10–4 to Barry Pinches in the next. These results meant that he dropped off the Main Tour.\nHe regained a place on the Main Tour for the 2009–10 Season by finishing top of the Welsh rankings.\nIn the qualifiers for the 2009 Shanghai Masters he beat former world champion John Parrott 5–0 (who later joked \"I hope I retire before I have to play him...again\" in reference to his earlier comment) before losing 5–3 to Mark Davis. His best run during the season was to the last 48 of the UK Championship, with victories over Daniel Wells, Jin Long and Jamie Burnett before losing 9–4 to Liang Wenbo. This meant that by the end of the season he had done enough to retain his tour status.\n2010/2011 season.\nHe started the new season by winning three qualifying matches in the 2010 Shanghai Masters, including a 5–1 win over Dominic Dale, before losing to Peter Ebdon by the same scoreline. He won two matches, before losing in the third qualifying round on two further occasions during the season. At the minor-ranking Euro PTC Event 3 White beat the likes of Tom Ford and Marco Fu to reach the quarter-finals, where he lost 2–4 to Andrew Higginson. He went on to finish 51st on the PTC Order of Merit and 71st in the world rankings.\n2011/2012 season.\nWhite narrowly missed out on a place in the 2012 Players Tour Championship Finals as he finished 25th on the Order of Merit, with only 24 players qualifying for the event. His placing was largely thanks to a semi-final run in Event 7, where his hopes of a first professional title were ended by Ronnie O'Sullivan, who won 4–2. Even though he could not qualify for a ranking event throughout the season he ended it at a then career high world ranking of 54, meaning he had risen 12 places during the year.\n2012/2013 season.\nWhite began the 2012–13 season by winning three matches to qualify for the Wuxi Classic and two matches to qualify for the International Championship but lost in the wildcard once at the venues in China in both, to Zhou Yuelong 4–5 and Lü Haotian 5–6 respectively.&lt;ref name=\"2012/13\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; White beat Craig Steadman and Ken Doherty to qualify for the UK Championship, the first time he had made it into the first round of a ranking event. In his first domestic televised match in a ranking event, White played world number two Mark Selby and recovered from 0–2 down to level at 3–3 before succumbing to a 3–6 defeat, with White stating afterwards that he would definitely be back for more. He kept true to his word by beating Zhang Anda 10–5 and Andrew Higginson 10–4 (he trailed 1–3 but won nine of the next ten frames) to qualify for the first round of the biggest tournament in snooker, the World Championship. He beat compatriot and two-time winner of the event Mark Williams in the opening round 10–6, with Williams admitting he had been outplayed in every department of the game. He beat fellow qualifier Dechawat Poomjaeng 13–3 in the last 16 and faced Ricky Walden in his first ranking event quarter-final, losing 6–13. White increased his ranking to world number 34, a climb of 20 spots during the season which was the most of any player on tour.\n2013/2014 season.\nWhite had an extremely consistent 2013–14 season as he played in the first round of 10 of the 12 ranking events.&lt;ref name=\"2013/14\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; \nIn the inaugural Indian Open he beat Zhang Anda and Gary Wilson to reach his second career quarter-final. He lost the last three frames against Stephen Maguire to be defeated 4–3. White reached the second round in four more ranking events during the rest of the season but was beaten on each occasion. At the World Championship, White was a qualifier and faced world number three (and eventual champion) Mark Selby in the first round. White recovered from 5–1, 8–4, and 9–8 behind to take the match to a deciding 19th frame, which he lost. He finished inside the top 32 in the rankings for the first time in his career as the world number 27.\n2014/2015 season.\nIn the first round of the Shanghai Masters, White came from 3–0 down against Neil Robertson to win 5–4 and went on to defeat Ryan Day 5–2 to make the quarter-finals. White made another comeback to force a deciding frame this time from 4–1 behind, but Mark Allen won it. Another quarter-final followed at the International Championship where Allen was again the victor as he won 6–3, after White had been 3–1 up.\nIn March 2015, White had a phenomenal run of form. He won his first professional title at the Shoot-Out, the tournament where each match is decided by one 10-minute frame, White won the title by taking the lead in the final against Xiao Guodong with six seconds remaining. He then won the Indian Open after reaching the semi-finals of a ranking event for the first time in his fifth attempt by beating Chris Wakelin 4–2. White then defeated Mark Williams 4–2 and saved his best performance of the week for the final against Ricky Walden where he scored a total of 419 points to Walden's 27 in claiming his first ranking title with a 5–0 win. His prize money for winning back-to-back tournaments stood at £82,000. White made his debut in the PTC Grand Final and lost 4–3 to Martin Gould in the first round. A pair of deciding frame victories over Ken Doherty and Stuart Bingham helped him to the last 16 of the China Open, but he was eliminated 5–1 by Robert Milkins. White's season ended with a 10–5 defeat to Craig Steadman in the second round of the World Championship qualifying. His year was reflected in the rankings as he rose 10 places to end it 17th in the world.\n2015/2016 season.\nWhite reached the quarter-finals of the Australian Goldfields Open, the first ranking event of the season and played former schoolmate Jamie Jones. The match went to a decider after White had been 4–2 up and he made a 56 in it, before Jones cleared with 66 to win 5–4. His ranking title gave him entry into the Champion of Champions, where he lost 4–2 to Joe Perry in the first round and he suffered an opening round 6–5 loss to Sydney Wilson, a player ranked more than 100 places lower than White, at the UK Championship. However, at the Gibraltar Open he whitewashed reigning world champion Stuart Bingham to reach his first European Tour final, but was defeated 4–1 by Marco Fu. White played in his first Welsh Open quarter-final after knocking out John Higgins 4–1 and lost it 5–0 to Mark Allen.\nAfter White lost 10–7 to Sam Baird in the first round of the World Championship he revealed that he suffers from depression and the stress of playing professional snooker can exacerbate it.\n2016/2017 season.\nWhite lost 4–2 in the fourth round of the Paul Hunter Classic to Jimmy White. A 5–4 re-spotted black win over Jimmy Robertson qualified him for the Shanghai Masters and he beat Ricky Walden 5–4 and Judd Trump 5–3, before losing 5–1 to Stephen Maguire in the quarter-finals. A second quarter-final came at the Northern Ireland Open and White was ousted 5–2 by Barry Hawkins. White lost 6–4 to compatriot Matthew Stevens in the second round of the UK Championship. He recorded a 4–3 win over John Higgins at the World Grand Prix, before being defeated 4–2 by Ryan Day in the second round. White hit three centuries in his 5–3 first round win over Yu Delu at the China Open and then beat Ali Carter by the same scoreline, but lost 5–1 to Shaun Murphy in the third round. He was heavily defeated 10–3 by Gary Wilson in the final qualifying round for the World Championship.\n2017/2018 season.\nWhite picked up his second ranking title by defeating Shaun Murphy 4–2 in the final of the 2017 Paul Hunter Classic, having previously defeated defending champion Mark Selby 4–1 in the fourth round.\n2019/2020 season.\nA \"sudden loss of form\" this season saw no finals and only one finish better than a second-round loss, that being the UK Championship, where he defeated Mark Selby 4–1 in the fourth round before losing by the same scoreline to Ian Burns in the quarter final. White thus dropped off the pro tour in 2020, which he later credited to personal issues including depression and \"a bit of a problem with alcohol\".\n2021/2022 season.\nWhite came from 6–7 behind to defeat Jordan Brown 10–8 in the fourth qualifying round of the 2022 World Snooker Championship, becoming only the second amateur to qualify for the Crucible after James Cahill in 2019. However, he went on to lose 10–3 in the first round to three-time champion Mark Williams, who made four centuries in the match. White will nevertheless regain his tour card for the subsequent season."

        "title": "Fencing (computing)",
        "text": "Fencing is the process of isolating a node of a computer cluster or protecting shared resources when a node appears to be malfunctioning. \nAs the number of nodes in a cluster increases, so does the likelihood that one of them may fail at some point. The failed node may have control over shared resources that need to be reclaimed and if the node is acting erratically, the rest of the system needs to be protected. Fencing may thus either disable the node, or disallow shared storage access, thus ensuring data integrity.\nBasic concepts.\nA node fence (or I/O fence) is a virtual \"fence\" that separates nodes which must not have access to a shared resource from that resource. It may separate an active node from its backup. If the backup crosses the fence and, for example, tries to control the same disk array as the primary, a data hazard may occur. Mechanisms such as STONITH are designed to prevent this condition.\nIsolating a node means ensuring that I/O can no longer be done from it. Fencing is typically done automatically, by cluster infrastructure such as shared disk file systems, in order to protect processes from other active nodes modifying the resources during node failures. Mechanisms to support fencing, such as the reserve/release mechanism of SCSI, have existed since at least 1985.\nFencing is required because it is impossible to distinguish between a real failure and a temporary hang. If the malfunctioning node is really down, then it cannot do any damage, so theoretically no action would be required (it could simply be brought back into the cluster with the usual join process). However, because there is a possibility that a malfunctioning node could itself consider the rest of the cluster to be the one that is malfunctioning, a split brain condition could ensue, and cause data corruption. Instead, the system has to assume the worst scenario and always fence in case of problems.\nApproaches to fencing.\nThere are two classes of fencing methods, one which disables a node itself, the other disallows access to resources such as shared disks. In some cases, it is assumed that if a node does not respond after a given time-threshold it may be assumed as non-operational, although there are counterexamples, e.g. a long paging rampage.\nThe STONITH method stands for \"Shoot The Other Node In The Head\", meaning that the suspected node is disabled or powered off. For instance, \"power fencing\" uses a power controller to turn off an inoperable node. The node may then restart itself and join the cluster later. However, there are approaches in which an operator is informed of the need for a manual restart for the node.\nThe \"resources fencing\" approach disallows access to resources without powering off the node. This may include:\nWhen the cluster has only two nodes, the reserve/release method may be used as a two node STONITH whereby upon detecting that node B has 'failed', node A will issue the reserve and obtain all resources (e.g. shared disk) for itself. Node B will be disabled if it tries to do I/O (in case it was temporarily hung). On node B the I/O failure triggers some code to kill the node. \nPersistent reservation is essentially a match on a key, so the node which has the right key can do I/O, otherwise its I/O fails. Therefore, it is sufficient to change the key on a failure to ensure the right behavior during failure. However, it may not always be possible to change the key on the failed node.\nSTONITH is an easier and simpler method to implement on multiple clusters, while the various approaches to resources fencing require specific implementation approaches for each cluster implementation."

Lleyton Hewitt, who was the 2006 runner-up, was the singles champion, while Bob and Mike Bryan were the doubles champions. The event was held in Las Vegas, Nevada at the Darling Tennis Center. It was the twentieth Tennis Channel Open, but just the second to be held in Las Vegas. The ITF women's competition was won by Caroline Wozniacki in singles and by Victoria Azarenka and Tatiana Poutchek for doubles.\nRound robin decision.\nSince the 2007 Tennis Channel Open featured a round robin formatted draw, an issue arose. Defending champion James Blake, Evgeny Korolev, and Juan Martín del Potro were to play each other and the winner of the round robin who would advance to the quarterfinals was determined by the number of matches and percent of sets and games that were won. Blake lost to Korolev, and Korolev then lost to del Potro. For Blake to advance to the quarterfinals of the 2007 Tennis Channel Open, he had to defeat del Potro, losing no more than five games. In this situation, each player would have won one match each, and Blake would have lost the fewest games. In the del Potro versus Blake match, Blake, who was winning 6–1, 3–1, beat del Potro because he retired. This eliminated del Potro from such a three-way tie, because he did not complete all of his matches. Korolev then moved on to the next round, since del Potro had been eliminated, and Korolev had already beaten Blake.\nThis caused a controversial issue that involved fans, Blake, and others, as they felt that Blake was to be in the quarterfinals. A press conference was held, and the ATP, which was chaired by Etienne de Villiers, determined that Blake would have beaten del Potro and thus met the rules for advancement into the quarterfinals. Since neither player knew that del Potro's retirement would result in such a large issue, Blake would have won, and therefore, Blake went into the quarterfinals.\nThe following morning, however, De Villiers decided that the rules for advancement should not be altered after the tournament's start, and therefore Korolev was entered the quarterfinals. Blake entered the 2007 Indian Wells Masters without being able to defend three of his titles. Later, the round robin format was ended, and all tournaments planning on employing the round robin format were changed back into the original draw format.\nFinals.\nMen's singles.\n Lleyton Hewitt defeated Jürgen Melzer 6–4, 7–6(12–10)\nWomen's singles.\n Caroline Wozniacki defeated Akiko Morigami 6–3, 6–2\nMen's doubles.\n Bob Bryan / Mike Bryan defeated Jonathan Erlich / Andy Ram 7–6(8–6), 6–2\nWomen's doubles.\n Victoria Azarenka / Tatiana Poutchek defeated Maret Ani / Alberta Brianti 6–2, 6–4"

        "text": "William Lloyd \"Jerry\" McCauley (July 6, 1872 – March 23, 1898) was an American college football player and coach. He was the third head coach of the University of Michigan football team.\nMcCauley listed his home town as Stanley, New York. He attended preparatory school at Geneva Prep. He later attended Princeton University, where he played for the Princeton Tigers football teams in 1892 and 1893 as a tackle, left end and halfback. He was six feet tall and 175 pounds while playing football at Princeton.\nMcCauley later enrolled at the University of Michigan as a medical student. While at Michigan, he served as the head coach of the 1894 and 1895 Michigan Wolverines football teams. He compiled a coaching record of 17–2–1, and his .875 winning percentage remains the second highest in the program's history. McCauley was a medical student at Michigan while he served as the coach of the football team. In his two seasons as head coach, the Wolverines lost only two games, once to Cornell and once to Harvard. In 1894, the Wolverines defeated Cornell, 12–4, the first time that a \"western school\" had beaten one of the established eastern football powers. He also served as an assistant coach for the 1896 Michigan football team.\nAfter leaving Michigan, McCauely was a student in the medical department of the University of Pennsylvania. In March 1898, he died of heart disease at his home in Rochester, New York."

        "text": "The 2007 Omega Mission Hills World Cup took place from 22 November to 25 November at Mission Hills Golf Club in Shenzhen, China. It was the 53rd World Cup. 28 countries competed and each country sent two players. The team purse is $5,000,000 with $1,600,000 going to the winner. The Scottish team of Colin Montgomerie and Marc Warren won the tournament. They defeated the American team of Heath Slocum and Boo Weekley in a playoff on the third extra hole. This was the first time that Scotland won the World Cup.\nQualification and format.\nThe leading 18 available players from the Official World Golf Ranking on 3 September 2007 qualified. These 18 players then selected a player from their country to compete with them. The person they pick had to be ranked within the top 100 on the Official World Golf Ranking as of 3 September. If there was no other player from that country within the top 100 then the next highest ranked player would be their partner. If there was no other available player from that country within the top 500, then the exempt player could choose whoever he wants as long as they are a professional from the same country. World qualifiers were held from 27 September to 30 September. Ten countries earned their spot in the World Cup, five from the Asian qualifier and five from the Aruba qualifier.\nThe tournament was a 72-hole stroke play team event with each team consisting of two players. The first and third days are four-ball play and the second and final days are foursomes play.\nScores.\n1st round (four-ball)\nSource\n2nd round (foursomes)\nSource\n3rd round (four-ball)\nSource\n4th round (foursomes)\nSource\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\nThe first round took place on 22 November and it was played in four-ball format. The front 9 scoring average was 32.036 and the back 9 average was 32.893 making the 18 hole average 64.929. The leaders after day one was the American team of Boo Weekley and Heath Slocum who shot an 11-under-par 61. Weekley shot 6 birdies and an eagle while Slocum added a birdie and an eagle. Weekley's eagle was a hole out on the 12th hole which is a 457-yard par 4.\nRight behind the Americans were the German team of Alex Čejka and Martin Kaymer who finished the day at a 10-under-par 62. Čejka led the team with 8 birdies. The German team of Marcel Siem and Bernhard Langer won the World Cup last year.\nSix teams shot a 9-under-par round of 63 and they are tied in third place. The Finnish team was the first off the tee and the surprise was Pasi Purhonen who is not ranked in the Official World Golf Rankings. He started out shooting birdie-birdie-eagle and also birdied the 9th. His partner Mikko Ilonen birdied the 5th hole as well. The team shot a 30 on the front 9 which helped them finish at 63. The Welsh team of Bradley Dredge and Stephen Dodd also shot a 63; including birdies on four of the last five holes. Another team that finished with a 63 was the English team of Justin Rose and Ian Poulter who had a pair of eagles. The Scottish team of Colin Montgomerie and Marc Warren also shot a 63 which included no bogeys. The South African and Thai team also shot a round of 63.\nThe host country China finished the day at 65 (-7) to be in a tie for 11th place. There were a total of 12 bogeys by all teams. Colombia and Puerto Rico (who are tied in last) each had 2 bogeys; no other team had more than one.\nSecond round.\nThe second round took place on 23 November and it was played in foursomes format. The amount of bogeys on the day almost septupled the amount from the 1st Round. A total of 83 bogeys were shot on the day including 8 double bogeys, one triple and one \"other\". The New Zealand team shot a quintuple-bogey 9 on the par-4 14th hole. The lowest round on the day was a 4-under-par 68 which was shot by four different teams. 14 teams shot rounds of par or worse. After the first two days, no team has had a bogey-free 36 holes.\nThe American team maintained their one stroke lead by shooting a 3-under-par 69. The Americans had a total of five birdies, four of which were on par-5s. The other birdie was on the par-4 opening hole. Since 2000, three of the seven winners have held the lead after 36 holes and have gone on to win the championship.\nThe English and Scottish teams are tied in 2nd place, one stroke behind the Americans. Both teams shot rounds of 68. The South African team is in 4th, 2 strokes behind the Americans. The host country China shot a 71 on the day and are tied in 12th place.\nThird round.\nThe third round took place on 24 November and it was played in four-ball format. The front 9 scoring average was 32.964 and the back 9 average was 33.643 making the 18 hole average 66.607. The American team maintained their one stroke lead by shooting a 66. Weekley eagled the 3rd hole and made birdies at 7, 9 and 11. All of those holes were par-5s. The American team has a total of 3 eagles on the tournament which is more than any other team. Germany has the most birdies with 22 while the Americans have 16. England and Denmark have the fewest bogeys, with one each. If the Americans win the event then they will be the first team to lead wire-to-wire in the last seven years. They have held a stroke lead after the first three days of the event.\nThe best round of the day was the 10-under-par 62 shot by the French team. The great round moved them from 10th place to 2nd place and they are 1 stroke behind the Americans. Raphaël Jacquelin made five birdies and his partner Grégory Havret made three birdies and an eagle. The French are tied with the Scottish team who shot a 66 on the day. Two strokes behind the Americans is the South African and English teams. The Dutch, Argentinians and Germans are tied in 6th place only 3 strokes behind the Americans.\nEvery team was under par on the day. Only five teams posted a better third round score compared to their 1st round score."

        "text": "William Douglas Ward (August 25, 1874 – May 13, 1936) was an American college football player and coach, physician and surgeon. He played football at Princeton University from 1893 to 1894 and was the coach of the University of Michigan football team in 1896. He later became a physician and surgeon in Rochester, New York. He was a pioneer in early surgical procedures to construct artificial vaginas and published an article on the subject in 1915.\nEarly years.\nWard was born in Rochester, New York in August 1874. His grandfather, Levi Ward, was the mayor of Rochester. His father, Frank Addison Ward, was a Rochester native, a Princeton alumnus, and the chief executive of Ward's Natural Science Establishment, a company that supplied natural history specimens to colleges, museums and collectors in the United States and Europe. Ward's mother, Mary Hawley Douglas, was also a native of New York. He had seven younger siblings born between 1879 and 1894. Ward attended preparatory school at St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire.\nPrinceton.\nWard enrolled at Princeton University, where he played football and baseball. He played at the left halfback position for the Princeton Tigers football team in 1893 and at quarterback in 1894. He scored the only touchdown in Princeton's 6–0 victory over Yale on Thanksgiving Day 1893. In December 1894, \"The New York Times\" wrote:\nWard received a bachelor of arts degree from Princeton in 1895, and was one of only seven students in Princeton's Class of 1895 to graduate magna cum laude. He was voted the \"Best All-Round Man in the Class, the \"Best All-Round Athlete,\" the \"Most Awkward Man,\" and the \"Latin Salutatorian.\"\nLawrenceville.\nAfter graduating from Princeton, Ward spent a year as a teacher in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. He also returned to Princeton during the fall of 1895 as an assistant coach for the Princeton football team. While at Lawrenceville, he sought \"to impart into growing youth the mathematical idea, also the rudiments of foot-ball, and the truth of truths that there is no University in the country like Princeton.\" He later wrote, \"Teaching, somehow, did not satisfy me: in fact, even before I left college I had an idea that I might be a doctor some day.\" In another piece, he noted that he \"tried for a year to instill Princeton ideas, along with a little knowledge into the heads of the younger generation. The work was pleasant and I was associated with some fine men; but medicine is to be my vocation.\"\nUniversity of Michigan.\nWard attended the medical school at the University of Michigan from 1896 to 1897. He also served as the head football coach for the 1896 Michigan Wolverines football team. He was assisted in coaching the team by William McCauley (during the month of October), Keene Fitzpatrick and James Robinson. He led the team to a 9–1 record, outscoring opponents 262 to 11. The team went undefeated and allowed only four points in its first nine games, including victories over Michigan Normal (18–0), Grand Rapids High School (44–0), Physicians &amp; Surgeons of Chicago (28–0), Rush Lake Forest (66–0), Purdue (16–0), Lehigh (40–0), Minnesota (6–4), Oberlin (10–0), and Wittenberg (28–0). The final game of the season was a 7–6 loss to the University of Chicago at Chicago Coliseum, in front of 8,000 fans. Ward later summarized his year at Michigan:\nHe added that the medical program at Michigan was very good, and their laboratories \"especially fine.\" While at Michigan, he was elected into the fraternity of Psi Upsilon. With respect to fraternity life, Ward wrote: \"The boys were very good to me there and among other things elected me a member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity. There was a nice set of boys in the chapter and I used to have my room at the chapter house. It made life at Ann Arbor much more pleasant than it would have been, and I enjoyed the fraternity life, though I still rejoice that we don't indulge at Princeton.\" In another article, Ward wrote, \"One year in the West was enough for me.\"\nPenn.\nIn 1897, Ward enrolled in the medical school at the University of Pennsylvania. Ward received his M.D. from Penn in 1899. While at Penn, he was a member of Psi Upsilon and the H.C. Wood Medical Society. As he had done at Michigan, Ward followed in the footsteps of William \"Jerry\" McCauley. Both were Princeton football players who coached football at Michigan and received their medical degrees at Penn. Ward later wrote, \"At Pennsylvania, too, 'Jerry' McCauley had been my forerunner, and he it was who took me around to see Dr. Joe upon the very day of my arrival in Philadelphia, and from that time until I left Philadelphia, in March, 1902, after a winter's special training with him, he was my friend and instructor; and if I ever make a name for myself in the domain of surgery it is his training that I have to thank for it. Many a morning would find me standing beside his operating table instead of on the benches of the lecture room where I belonged, but I have never repented my choice.\"\nMedical career.\nIn 1902, Ward established a general medical practice at Rochester, New York. In 1905, he wrote an article on \"A Doctor's Life\" in which he noted:\nHe became prominent as a physician and surgeon in Rochester. He was a surgeon at Rochester General Hospital and a member of the Rochester Medical Association and the Rochester Athletic Club. In 1905, he published an article titled, \"The Possibility of Clean Obstetrical Work in the Slums,\" in \"\"American Medicine\".\" In 1910, Ward presented a paper to the Medical Society of the State of New York titled, \"General Peritonitis – Shall We Ask Nature to do Her Own Surgery?\" In 1915, he published an article titled \"The Construction of an Artificial Vagina With Establishment of the Menstrual Function\" in the journal, \"Surgery, Gynecology and Obstetrics\". He wrote the article after studying attempts by doctors in Germany and the United States to construct artificial vaginas and after successfully performing the surgery on a 13-year-old girl at Rochester General Hospital. Ward became an advocate of the procedure and wrote:\nWard served overseas in World War I, and later served as a surgeon at the Park Avenue Clinical Hospital and was a member of the Medical Advisory Board and the New York State Selective Draft Service.\nFamily and later years.\nOn May 10, 1905, Ward was married to Anne Marie Devine. At the time of the 1910 United States Census, Ward was living with his wife in Rochester, New York. They had twin sons born April 30, 1906, though one of the sons died in infancy. The surviving son was Francis Bernard Ward. They subsequently had another son, William Douglas Ward, Jr.\nIn a draft registration card completed in September 1918, Ward stated that he was living at 20 Grove Place in Rochester, New York, and was employed as a physician and surgeon. At the time of the 1920 United States Census, Ward and his wife continued to reside at 20 Grove Place in Rochester with their two sons.\nWard died in 1936 at Park Avenue Hospital in Rochester."

        "title": "Hugo MacNeill (rugby union)",
        "text": "Hugh Patrick MacNeill OBE (born 16 September 1958), commonly known as Hugo MacNeill, is a former rugby union player who played for Ireland, Leinster, the French Barbarians and the British and Irish Lions during the 1980s. During the late 1970s he also played soccer for University College Dublin and Dublin University. After retiring from sport, MacNeill went on to serve as a director for Goldman Sachs. He has also worked as a rugby pundit for TV3 and BBC Radio 5 Live.\nEducation.\nBlackrock College.\nMacNeill completed his secondary level education at Blackrock College. On 20 March 1977 he was a member of the Blackrock College team that won the Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Cup, defeating St Mary's College 24–12 after extra time at Lansdowne Road. The St Mary's team featured MacNeill's future Ireland teammate Paul Dean. MacNeill scored a conversion and two penalties in extra time to help seal victory for Blackrock.\nTrinity College Dublin.\nMacNeill subsequently attended Trinity College Dublin where he earned a degree in economics and social studies followed by and a diploma in Anglo-Irish literature. He was elected a Scholar of the College in 1979 in economics and social studies. His lecturers included Brendan Kennelly and David Norris. While at Trinity he played for both the rugby union and association football teams. On 26 November 1980 he captained Dublin University to a 9–3 win over University College Dublin in The Colours Match. He also went on a rugby union tour to Japan and represented the team in games against both Oxford University and Cambridge University. He played association football for both University College Dublin and Dublin University A.F.C. In 1979 he was a member of the Dublin University team, coached by Liam Tuohy, that won the Collingwood Cup. MacNeill scored twice in the final as Dublin University defeated Maynooth University 2–0.\nOxford University.\nMacNeill also studied economics at St Edmund Hall, Oxford. Between 1982 and 1984 he played in three Varsity matches for Oxford University against Cambridge University but lost all three. He captained the Oxford team in 1983.\nInternational career.\nIreland.\nBetween 1981 and 1988, MacNeill made 37 appearances for Ireland. He made his debut for Ireland on 7 February 1981 against France at Lansdowne Road, scoring the first of ten international tries. In the same championship he scored a second try against Wales and a drop goal against England. He scored further tries against England in 1982 and Scotland in 1988. He also scored a penalty against Wales in 1983. MacNeill was a member of the Ireland teams that won the Five Nations Championship and Triple Crown in 1982 and 1985 and shared the championship with France in 1983. He was also a member of the Ireland squad at the 1987 Rugby World Cup, where he scored four tries in Ireland's four games, one against Canada, two against Tonga and one in the quarter-final defeat to Australia. MacNeill made his final appearance for Ireland against England on 23 April 1988. Together with Tony Ward, Moss Keane, Donal Spring and Ciaran Fitzgerald, MacNeill declined to take part in the 1981 Ireland rugby union tour of South Africa during the apartheid era. In the aftermath of the 1996 Docklands bombing, together with Trevor Ringland, MacNeill helped organise a friendly between Ireland and the Barbarians at Lansdowne Road to show that the people of Ireland wanted peace.\nBritish and Irish Lions.\nMacNeill made three test appearances for the British and Irish Lions during their 1983 tour of New Zealand. MacNeill scored a penalty against Auckland in the first of his nine appearances on the tour. He started the first two matches against the All Blacks before coming off the bench to replace Ollie Campbell in the final test.\nFrench Barbarians.\nOn 22 October 1989 MacNeill played for the French Barbarians against Fiji. Fiji won the game 32–16.\nLater years.\nBetween 1982 and 2000 MacNeill worked in London, initially for the Boston Consulting Group and later for Goldman Sachs. In 2000 he returned to Dublin where he continued to work for Goldman Sachs as a director of their investment branch in Ireland.

        "title": "Bangladeshi cricket team in New Zealand in 2007–08",
        "text": "The Bangladesh cricket team toured New Zealand between 19 December 2007 and 16 January 2008 to play three one day internationals (ODIs) and two Test matches. This was the second Bangladeshi tour to New Zealand (the first being their 2001–02 tour) and the third series between the two countries following New Zealand's 2004–05 tour to Bangladesh. The teams also met in the pool stage of the 2003 Cricket World Cup and at the Super 8 stage of the 2007 Cricket World Cup.\nNew Zealand whitewashed Bangladesh in both the ODI and Test series, leaving them still searching for their first win against New Zealand in an official match. They did beat New Zealand in a warm-up match for the 2007 World Cup; however this was not recognised as an official match. Similarly, Bangladesh beat a New Zealand XI on this tour but, as this was not an official New Zealand team, it did not count as an official match either.\nNew Zealand cricket team.\nAt the start of the series, New Zealand were ranked third in the ICC ODI Championship and seventh in the ICC Test Championship. Prior to this series, the New Zealand team had toured South Africa, losing the test series 2–0 and the ODI series 2–1; and Australia, where they lost the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy series 2–0.\nBangladesh cricket team.\nBangladesh were ranked ninth in the ODI championship and ninth in the test championship. Their previous outing was in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 championships where they reached the Super 8 stage. Their most recent series was their 2007 tour to Sri Lanka where they lost both the Test and ODI series 3–0.\nSquads.\nFollowing New Zealand's losses in South Africa and Australia, three players from the touring squad – Lou Vincent, Michael Mason and Gareth Hopkins – were released to return to their provincial teams in order to give them playing time in the State Shield. Peter Fulton, who had missed the two tours due to having knee surgery, was included in the squad after showing good form in the four-day State Championship competition. Mason was called back into the squad for the third ODI as cover for Mark Gillespie who injured his left shoulder bowling in the second match.\nBangladesh named opener Junaid Siddique, uncapped at One Day International level, in their squad while recalling fast bowler Nazmul Hossain after impressive domestic performances. Injuries to Tushar Imran and Syed Rasel resulted in Rajin Saleh and Sajidul Islam being added to the squad prior to the series.\nNew Zealand recalled opening batsman Matthew Bell to the Test squad, dropping Michael Papps, Scott Styris, and Ross Taylor from the squad that had travelled to South Africa. Peter Fulton was also recalled with Jeetan Patel set to join the squad for the second Test, and Mark Gillespie ready to take his place if he were to recover from a shoulder injury.\nBangladesh called up Habibul Bashar, Shahriar Nafees, and Enamul Haque junior, while Javed Omar, Tushar Imran, Nazmul Hossain, and Mehrab Hossain junior returned home.\nTour matches.\nNorthern Districts (Game 1).\nBangladesh's first game on tour was a one-day match against the State Shield side Northern Districts. They lost two early wickets, both caught behind, before captain Mohammed Ashraful and debutant Junaid Siddique steadied the innings. Having reached 121 for two after 32 overs, they then lost five wickets for just 56 runs before lower-order batsmen Farhad Reza and Mashrafe Mortaza saw the innings through to 222. In response, Nick Horsley made a career-best 92 from 99 balls which, along with a quick-fire 55 from 39 balls by James Marshall, was enough to see Northern Districts win comfortably.\nBangladesh suffered a further setback during the game, with opening bowler Syed Rasel injuring his collarbone while fielding. Sajidul Islam was flown into the squad as a replacement after it was determined Rasel had dislocated the left collarbone.\nNorthern Districts (Game 2).\nThe second tour match, also against Northern Districts, was eventually abandoned due to rain. After early rain had forced the match to be reduced to 41 overs per innings, Northern won the toss, decided to bat and made 173 for seven. \nAlthough they did not get a chance to bat, Bangladesh's bowling and fielding efforts were noticeably better than in the first game.\nAuckland.\nThe third game on tour was against another provincial side, Auckland. Having won the toss, Bangladesh chose to bat; and opener Tamim Iqbal scored a century. In response, Auckland overhauled Bangladesh's total of 242 with ease, with Richard Jones top-scoring with 85 not out and each of the batsmen hitting at least one six in their innings.\nTwenty20.\nA Twenty20 charity match was held between Bangladesh and a New Zealand Cricket XI with the funds raised going to people affected by Cyclone Sidr; the International Cricket Council donated an additional US$250,000 to the funds at the start of the match. Asked to bat first, the New Zealand side had a slow start, making just 19 runs for the loss of two wickets after 5.3 overs. Most of the batsmen seemed out of form and fell to injudicious shots, with an unbeaten 33 from James Marshall seeing the side through to 133 for seven from their 20 overs.\nBangladesh began their innings in a similar manner, losing their opening batsmen early. They recovered with Mohammad Ashraful and Aftab Ahmed scoring quick runs before being run out; the match was won with three overs to spare owing to the efforts of Shakib Al Hasan, Mehrab Hossain and top scorer Farhad Reza. Stephen Fleming, who captained the New Zealand side, later said that \"it feels very tentative with the batting unit – there's been a lot of focus on it, the performances haven't been great and with that comes a certain amount of tension.\"\nODI series.\n1st ODI.\nBangladesh batted first after New Zealand, captained by Daniel Vettori, won the toss and chose to bowl. Having lost two early wickets, a 97-run partnership between captain Mohammad Ashraful (who scored 70 from 57 balls in an innings that Vettori labeled as \"outstanding\") and Tamim Iqbal seemed to set Bangladesh up for a good score. However, they then lost their remaining seven wickets for just 51 runs to end on 201 runs, with coach Jamie Siddons admitting\nthat they had been aiming for 280 when they should have been more concerned with ensuring a total of at least 250. In reply, New Zealand cruised to victory with six wickets and 44 balls to spare, led by 88 runs from opener Jamie How.\n2nd ODI.\nNew Zealand won the toss again, but chose to bat first this time. New Zealand made 335 in their innings, with all six players who batted reaching at least 30 runs. Having started with a 63-run opening partnership, Bangladesh lost three wickets in quick succession and from then on never threatened to overhaul New Zealand's score, with rain ending the match with seven overs remaining. After the game, questions were raised about Bangladesh's lack of interest in chasing the total; Siddons defended their tactics saying their plan was to conserve wickets for a final assault, but they lost the momentum after the loss of those three wickets.\n3rd ODI.\nThe only change to the teams for the third ODI was Michael Mason coming into the New Zealand side for Mark Gillespie who was injured in the second match. New Zealand won the toss for the third time in the series and, as in Auckland in the first match, asked Bangladesh to bat first. Bangladesh lost four early wickets and were at 46 for four after 19 overs. They couldn't recover as they were all out for 93 runs in the 38th over. In the process, Vettori became New Zealand's leading one-day wicket taker, overtaking Chris Harris with his second five-wicket haul; in addition, the five-wicket haul made him the top ODI wicket taker in the world in 2007. In reply, New Zealand blitzed the Bangladesh bowlers, taking just six overs to win without losing a wicket. Brendon McCullum scored an unbeaten 80 off just 28 balls (at a strike rate of 286) and Jamie How scored 7 not out having only faced eight balls.\nTest matches.\n1st test.\nOnce again, New Zealand won the toss and asked Bangladesh to bat first. Their first innings was similar to the final One Day International, with only opener Tamim Iqbal, who scored 53 on debut, offering any real resistance as Bangladesh made 137. Chris Martin took four wickets, ending the innings on 117 career wickets, 7th equal on the all-time New Zealand list with Richard Collinge, whileJacob Oram took three wickets. \nIn response, New Zealand overtook the total on the first day, reaching 156/4 by stumps. The innings was led by Matthew Bell, playing his first test since 2001, who was 74 not out at the end of the first day's play. He reached his second test century in the morning session of the second day before being dismissed by Mohammad Ashraful. Jacob Oram also reached three figures, top-scoring with 117; however the rest of the batsmen did not make any major contribution with Daniel Vettori's 32 being the third highest score and only four players making more than twenty. Dismissing New Zealand for 357 marked the first time in seven tests that the Bangladeshi bowlers had dismissed a batting side.\nTrailing by 220 runs, Bangladesh's second innings started in a markedly different manner to their first. Openers Tamim Iqbal and Junaid Siddique were both unbeaten at stumps on day two, and their 148-run stand broke the Bangladeshi record for the highest opening partnership. The batsmen, both playing their first Test match, had reached 72 and 69 respectively at the end of the day's play. However the pair were dismissed early on day three, with Bangladesh then collapsing to be 206/5 at lunch before being dismissed for 254. Needing just 35 runs for the victory, New Zealand wrapped the match up before tea on the third day with only the loss of Craig Cumming for four.\nVettori later said that he had been too attacking with the field settings at the start of the Bangladeshi second innings, and that advice from former captain Stephen Fleming and coach John Bracewell overnight led to a changed game plan on the third day with the desired results.\n2nd test.\nIn the second Test, New Zealand won their ninth toss in a row and asked Bangladesh to bat first. Their batting collapsed, similar to the first innings of the Dunedin test, as they went to lunch at 86 for five. Chris Martin and Iain O'Brien were the main wicket-takers with five and three wickets respectively as Bangladesh were dismissed for 143. Martin's five wicket haul was his eighth in tests and moved him up to sixth on New Zealand's all-time wicket taking list, equalling Ewen Chatfield with 123 wickets.\nIn response, New Zealand came within nine runs at the end of the first day's play as they finished on 134/3. Craig Cumming, whose spot in the side was under pressure from Jamie How, made 42 before being dismissed leg before wicket for the third innings in a row. At the close of play, Stephen Fleming was unbeaten on 39, as he looked for his first Test century on his home ground. On the morning of the second day, Bangladesh dropped four catches in the first 90 minutes before finally dismissing Mathew Sinclair. Fleming was also dropped from a skied shot before being dismissed for 87 off a similar shot. Vettori and Brendon McCullum put together an 81 run partnership at 5.28 runs per over before McCullum was dismissed; Vettori finished as the top scorer with 94. Despite leading by 250 runs after being dismissed for 393, there was some criticism of the ability of the batsmen to carry on to large scores, with five batsmen scoring at least 40 but none being able to break 100.\nBangladesh's second innings did not start any better than their first. With Tamim Iqbal unable to open the batting, having fractured his left thumb dropping a catch, they had lost five wickets by stumps on the second day. All of the wickets had been caught behind the wicket, with wicket-keeper McCullum taking one and the remainder being caught by the slips. At the end of the day's play, Bangladesh were 51/5 needing a further 199 runs to make New Zealand bat again and thus avoid an innings defeat. On the third day, the Black Caps required only 25 more overs to dismiss Bangladesh for an innings win. Only Shakib Al Hasan offered any resistance, finishing on an unbeaten 41. Equally telling was that Bangladesh's highest-scoring partnership in their second innings was 30 on the last wicket."

        "text": "The George Washington Revolutionaries men's basketball team represents George Washington University in the United States' capital, Washington, D.C. It plays its home games in the Charles E. Smith Center, which is also shared with other George Washington Revolutionaries athletic programs. The school's team currently competes in the Atlantic 10 Conference. The head coach is Chris Caputo. The official dance team for the Revolutionaries is the GW First Ladies.\nHistory.\n1990s.\nMike Jarvis was hired as head coach in 1990. Led by future NBA player Yinka Dare, the Colonials received an at-large bid to the 1993 NCAA tournament, the Colonials first NCAA Tournament appearance since 1961. GW advanced to the Sweet Sixteen before losing to the Fab Five Michigan team (which later vacated its wins due to NCAA rule violations).\nThe Colonials would also make NCAA Tournament appearances in 1994, 1996, and 1998 under Jarvis. Jarvis would leave the school in 1998 to accept the head coaching position at St. John's.\nThe school then hired recently fired Texas head coach, Thomas Penders. Penders would spend three years at GW, before resigning amidst accusations of NCAA rules violations.\n2000s.\nGW would then turn to Karl Hobbs on May 2, 2001, as head coach. Hobbs, who spent eight years an assistant at Connecticut, led GW to back to the national stage in 2004 after defeating No. 9 Michigan State and No. 12 Maryland in back-to-back games to win the 2004 BB&amp;T Classic. That year, the men's basketball team went on to win the Atlantic 10 West title and the Atlantic 10 tournament, earning an automatic bid to the 2005 NCAA tournament. The team received a No. 12 seed, losing to No. 5 seed Georgia Tech in the First Round.\nThe team began the 2005–06 season ranked 21st in the Associated Press poll, reaching as high as sixth in the polls and closed out the year ranked 19th in the nation. With a 26–2 going into the 2006 NCAA tournament. They received an at-large bid to the Tournament as a No. 8 seed where they came back from an 18-point second-half deficit to defeat No. 9 seed UNC-Wilmington. However, in the Second Round, they lost to Duke, the top overall seed. J. R. Pinnock was drafted in the 2006 NBA draft and two other Colonials from that team played in the NBA. Pops Mensah-Bonsu played for the Dallas Mavericks, Houston Rockets, San Antonio Spurs, and Toronto Raptors and Mike Hall played for the Washington Wizards.\nThe 2006–07 basketball season was considered by many to be a rebuilding year for the Colonials after graduating their entire starting front court and losing Pinnock to the NBA. Coach Karl Hobbs and Senior guard Carl Elliott led the team to a 23–8 record, winning the 2007 Atlantic 10 tournament, once again earning an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. The Colonials were received a No. 11 seed and lost to No. 6-seed Vanderbilt.\nThe Colonials would struggle the next three years and after finishing the 2010–11 season with a record of 17–14, capped by a disappointing 71–59 overtime loss to Saint Joseph's in the conference tournament, Karl Hobbs was dismissed as head coach.\n2010s.\nOn May 11, 2011, Mike Lonergan, former head coach of Vermont, was hired to replace Hobbs.\nThe 2011–12 basketball season, Lonergan's first with the Colonials, resulted in a 10–21 record (5–11 in Atlantic 10). By the 2013–14 season, Lonergan had rebuilt the program and finished third in the Atlantic 10 with a 24–8 record (11–5 in Atlantic 10). The team received an at-large bid to the 2014 NCAA Tournament, its first NCAA Tournament since 2007. They received a No. 9 seed in the East Region and would lose to Memphis in the Second Round (formerly known as the First Round).\nThe Colonials regressed the following year, finishing 22–12. They did, however, receive a bid to the NIT where they defeated Pittsburgh before losing in the second round to Temple.\nIn 2016, the Colonials again missed the NCAA Tournament and again received a bid to the NIT. This time the Colonials would defeat Hofstra, Momouth, and Florida to reach the NIT final four at Madison Square Garden. In the NIT semifinal, they defeated San Diego State to advance to the championship game. In the championship game, they cruised to the NIT championship with a 76–60 win over Valparaiso.\nHowever, the Colonials could not build on their NIT success as the school fired head coach Mike Lonergan on September 16, 2016, after an investigation found him guilty of verbally and emotionally abusing his players.\nThe school named assistant coach Maurice Joseph interim coach for the 2016–17 season. The Colonials finished the 2017 season 20–15, 10–8 in A-10 play and received a bid to the College Basketball Invitational where they defeated Toledo in the first round before losing to UIC.On March 27, 2017, the school removed the interim tag and named Maurice Joseph full-time head coach.\nJoseph was fired after the 2018–19 season.

King scored eight straight points and tied the game at 63–63. The clock then showed all zeros and the GW men's basketball team trailed 18th-ranked Xavier 68–66.

        "title": "Bob Timberlake (American football)",
        "text": "Robert W. Timberlake (born October 18, 1943) is a former American football player who played college football for the University of Michigan Wolverines from 1962 to 1964 and for the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL) in 1965.\nTimberlake was the starting quarterback for Michigan who led the Wolverines to the 1964 Big Ten Conference championship and a 34–7 victory over Oregon State Beavers in the 1965 Rose Bowl. Timberlake was selected as a first-team All-American in 1964, received the Chicago Tribune Silver Football trophy as the Most Valuable Player in the Big Ten, and finished fourth in the 1964 Heisman Trophy voting. Over his three years at Michigan, Timberlake rushed for 315 yards and passed for 1,507 yards. He was responsible for 19 touchdowns, eleven rushing and eight passing. He also served as the team's punter and placekicker with six field goals, 36 extra points, and a total of 121 points scored.\nAfter a brief career in professional football, Timberlake became an ordained Presbyterian minister. Even during his football career, Timberlake was outspoken about his Christian faith. He has also been active in Habitat for Humanity. Since 2003, he has been on the faculty of Marquette University where he teaches courses in community service and affordable housing.\nCollege football.\nTimberlake was born in Middletown, Ohio, but he was raised in Franklin, Ohio and played football for the Franklin Wildcats. He was originally recruited as a halfback and played more than any other Michigan player at halfback in 1962. However, he was later switched to the quarterback position and had his greatest success there.\n1964 regular season.\nIn 1964, Timberlake led the Wolverines football team to their first Big Ten Conference championship since 1950, breaking the longest championship drought in school history. Playing quarterback, Timberlake's total offense of 1,381 yards (807 passing and 574 rushing) was the second highest in Michigan history at that time. The 1964 Wolverines outscored their opponents 235–83, finished the regular season 8–1, and narrowly missed an undefeated season with a 21–20 loss to a Purdue Boilermakers team led by sophomore Bob Griese. By virtue of turnovers, Purdue led 21–14 with five minutes remaining. Timberlake ran an option play to the left side and went 54 yards for a touchdown. Rather than kick the extra point for the tie, Timberlake carried again on the option play to the right, but was tackled one foot short of the goal line, and two points short of an undefeated season. When Michigan and Ohio State met in Columbus, Ohio on November 21, 1964, both teams were in the Top 10 in the national rankings. Michigan had not beaten Ohio State since 1959. Michigan won 10–0, as Ohio native Timberlake was responsible for all ten points, including a 17-yard touchdown pass to Jim Detwiler and a fourth-quarter, 27-yard field goal to clinch the game.\n1965 Rose Bowl.\nThe Wolverines (ranked No. 4) advanced to the Rose Bowl where they defeated Tommy Prothro's Oregon State Beavers, 34–7, on New Year's Day. Prior to the Rose Bowl, much of the attention was focused on Michigan's veteran quarterback. The \"Pasadena Star-News\" wrote that Timberlake was \"the key\" to Michigan's attack: \"He does everything—run, pass, kick field goals, soup up the team…Timberlake has had that strength. The Wolverines listen to him and they believe in him. At 6–4 and weighing 215 pounds, Timberlake is a Lincoln to look up to.\" Mel Anthony scored three touchdowns for Michigan, and Timberlake and the Wolverines gained 415 yards in the game. Timberlake was 7-for-10 passing for 77 yards, and added 57 yards rushing, including a 24-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter.\nPost-season honors.\nAt the end of the 1964 season, Timberlake was awarded the Chicago Tribune Silver Football as the Most Valuable Player in the Big Ten Conference. He placed fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting (losing to Notre Dame's John Huarte), and was also named to multiple All-American teams. After attending an All-American dinner at New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel, Timberlake reported, \"There is a great deal of loneliness in being an All-America. . . . I get sick of it. They all want to shake your hand, but they don't really know you. All they do is stick out the glad hand. I don't mind talking to anyone who is interested in ideas, but nothing makes me sicker than having my name dropped by people who don't know anything about me except that I'm an All-America.\" He joked that he might write an autobiography called, \"The Loneliness of an All-America.\" He was also an A-minus student majoring in sociology, was named a scholar-athlete by National Football Association, and was placed on the Big Ten All-Academic team two years in a row.\nReligion in Timberlake's life.\nTimberlake was outspoken during his time in the limelight about the importance of his Christian faith. While attending the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, he said that at one point he felt his \"whole life was really off the track\", but \"the guidance of Dr. Ernest T. Campbell, a great speaker\" at the First Presbyterian Church of Ann Arbor helped him to develop his faith. Timberlake taught Sunday school and said he intended to become a Presbyterian minister. At a speech in Mansfield, Ohio, shortly after winning the Rose Bowl in January 1965, Timberlake said, \"I couldn't have played football if it hadn't been for Jesus Christ.\" He continued, \"God changed my life. He promises the abundant life, which he has given me, and eternal life, which if I die I'm sure I will have. There's peace associated with being a Christian.\"\nTimberlake also spoke openly of his personal conversion as he walked in a parking lot while on a night watchman's job at a Chevrolet plant in Warren, Michigan. Timberlake defined a Christian as \"one who has Christ as his personal savior,\" and not just a person who was brought up in a Christian home or goes to church.\nWhen he signed a professional football contract with the New York Giants, Timberlake stated that he intended to take ministerial training at Princeton Theological Seminary during the off-season. He noted, \"I don't really want to play professional football, because there is no privacy and no time to be alone when you're a famous athlete.\" He emphasized that, if he were ever forced to choose between professional football or studying for the ministry, he would give up football: \"I see no reason why I can't do both, but if I have to give up pro ball, I'll certainly do it.\" Timberlake said the thing he would always remember about playing football was the 20 minutes before kickoff. He recalled that those 20 minutes were \"horrible.\" \"You want to go home. You want to quit football. It is times like these when something happens to me. I can't explain it. I put my face in my hands and ask God to come into my heart and give me courage. He gives me peace.\"\nWhen a boy asked Timberlake for his autograph at the Giants' rookie camp in 1965, Timberlake signed his name but also wrote citations to two Bible verses: and 1 Peter 1:5–9. The boy asked, \"What's that?\" Timberlake explained they were Bible verses, and he told reporters he started doing it about six months earlier, hoping the kids would look up the verses. In 1965, such public religious expressions were not common among athletes, and columnists made note of the fact that Timberlake \"packs a Bible in his suitcase and keeps one in his locker.\"\nWhile playing for the Giants in October 1965, he told an interviewer: \"I'm playing football to convey Christianity either indirectly or directly and to give me access to you people. The eye of American is upon the sports' field, so I can reach more people playing football. I guess you can say my goal is to spread a Christian message.\" At that time, he was attending Princeton Theological Seminary once a week and planned to attend full-time after the football season. Asked if the violent nature of football was inconsistent with his Christian beliefs, Timberlake noted that \"you don't need to hurt anyone to get by\" in football and that the game involved skill, timing and execution more than violence. He then joked, \"There's nothing really wrong with good, clean violence.\"\nProfessional football.\nThe New York Giants drafted Timberlake in the third round of the 1965 NFL Draft. He signed a two-year contract with the Giants for an estimated $85,000 ($12,500 per year base plus $60,000 in bonuses and fringe benefits). Timberlake turned down offers from the Buffalo Bills in the American Football League (AFL) and the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the Canadian Football League (CFL) because he had an opportunity to compete for a starting job with the Giants. Future Pro Football Hall of Famer Y. A. Tittle’s tenure with the Giants was over, and Timberlake was expected to compete in a new system that would emphasize rushing quarterbacks.\nTimberlake did not get the quarterback spot with the Giants and was assigned as kickoff specialist; he was also used as a kicker on long field goals for the 1965 NFL season. In a nationally televised game on October 3, 1965, at Pittsburgh, Timberlake hit a 43-yard field goal in a 23–13 win. Timberlake’s kick against the Pittsburgh Steelers was the last field goal by any Giants kicker that season.\nEarly in an October 24 game against the Cleveland Browns, the Giants' main placekicker twisted an ankle. Timberlake took over as the team’s full-time kicker until the season’s final week. Timberlake went 0-for-14 in field goal attempts for the rest of the season, and three of his shorter attempts were blocked.\nIn the 1966 pre-season, Timberlake was third on the Giants' depth chart at quarterback. In the September 1966 issue of the Sporting News, Timberlake lamented: \"I’m not doing anything. For four days the other week, I didn’t throw a single pass. Not a single pass.\" After just one season, the Giants cut Timberlake from the team on August 29, 1966, at their camp in Fairfield, Connecticut. \nIn an article concluding that Timberlake may have been the worst placekicker in NFL history, the writer concluded: \"Timberlake’s 1-for-15 performance makes him look like a laughingstock. He’s better remembered as one of Michigan’s great quarterbacks, a Rose Bowl hero who might have had what it took to be a fine pro quarterback or running back. It’s a shame he was asked to do what he couldn’t.\" Sports blog Deadspin ranked Timberlake the 2nd-worst player to ever play in the NFL, only behind quarterback Rusty Lisch.\nImpact on the AFL–NFL merger.\nBecause of Timberlake's poor performance as a kicker in 1965, the Giants signed Buffalo Bills kicker Pete Gogolak in 1966, who was also football's first soccer-style kicker. Previously, kickers kicked the ball straight on instead of at a soccer-style angle, which improved accuracy and is the standard at all levels of football today. This ended a \"gentleman's agreement\" between the NFL and the AFL in not signing each other's players, and would start a rash of signings that would eventually led to the two leagues merging.\nIn an NFL Films documentary featuring Timberlake, Steve Sabol called Timberlake the \"father of the Super Bowl\", because his poor performance indirectly led to the two leagues merging and the Super Bowl being formed.\nLife after football.\nTimberlake went on to become an ordained Presbyterian minister and a hospital administrator at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, which is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 2003, Timberlake joined the faculty of Marquette University where he teaches courses on community service and faith, and mentors the student Habitat for Humanity chapter. In 2007, Timberlake said he saw the community service course as \"an excellent opportunity to bring along the next generation\" to address problems of neighborhood blight, poverty, family disorganization, failure in school, and incarceration for African-American males. He described the problems facing the poor as \"a colossal, colossal waste of human life.\" Timberlake has been a volunteer for several years with Milwaukee's Habitat for Humanity chapter, and one of the courses he teaches at Marquette is called \"Decent and Affordable Housing,\" in which students are instructed in construction methods (and use of power tools), investigate the causes of hyper-segregation, study substandard housing as a social injustice issue, and spend part of the semester at a Habitat for Humanity work site helping to build a house. The course is taught through the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, which has hired Timberlake as an adjunct professor. Timberlake, who is not an engineer by trade, has overseen the construction of eleven garages through the project. Timberlake is a proponent of gay marriage."

        "title": "Michigan Wolverines men's basketball",
        "text": "The Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team is the intercollegiate men's basketball program representing the University of Michigan. The school competes in the Big Ten Conference in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Wolverines play home basketball games at the Crisler Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Michigan has won one NCAA Championship as well as two National Invitation Tournaments (NIT), 15 Big Ten Conference titles and two Big Ten tournament titles. In addition, it has won an NIT title and won a Big Ten tournament that were vacated due to NCAA sanctions. \nMichigan has had 35 All-Americans, selected 48 times. Eight of these have been consensus All-Americans, which are Cazzie Russell (twice), Rickey Green, Gary Grant, Chris Webber, Trey Burke, as well as Harry Kipke, Richard Doyle and Bennie Oosterbaan (twice) who were retroactively selected by the Helms Foundation. Twelve All-Americans have been at least two-time honorees. Russell was the only three-time All-American.\nMichigan basketball players have been successful in professional basketball. Seventy-six have been drafted into the National Basketball Association (NBA); thirty-one of those were first round draft picks, including both Cazzie Russell and Chris Webber who were drafted first overall. The 1990 NBA draft, in which Rumeal Robinson was selected 10th, Loy Vaught was selected 13th, and Terry Mills was selected 16th made Michigan the third of only ten schools that have ever had three or more players selected in the first round of the same draft. Six players have gone on to become NBA champions for a total of nine times and eight players have become NBA All-Stars a total of 18 times. Rudy Tomjanovich coached both the 1994 and 1995 NBA Finals Champions. Glen Rice is one of only thirteen basketball players to have won a state high school championship, NCAA title and NBA championship.\nDuring the 1990s Michigan endured an NCAA violations scandal, described as involving one of the largest amounts of illicit money in NCAA history, when Ed Martin loaned four players a reported total of $616,000. Due to NCAA sanctions, records from the 1992 Final Four, the 1992–93 season, and 1995–99 seasons have been vacated. Throughout this article asterisks denote awards, records and honors that have been vacated.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1908–19).\nAs a result of public and alumni demand for a basketball team, Michigan fielded a team of members of the then-current student body and achieved a 1–4 record for the 1908–09 season. However, after three years of demanding a basketball program, the student body did not attend the games and the program was terminated due to low attendance. Basketball returned in 1917 in what was considered the inaugural season of varsity basketball. The team was coached by Elmer Mitchell who instituted the intramural sports program at Michigan. The team finished 6–12 overall (0–10, Big Ten). The following year Mitchell led the team to a 16–8 (5–5) record.\nMather era (1919–28).\nE. J. Mather coached the team to three Big Ten titles in his nine seasons as coach. After inheriting Mitchell's team, which he led to a 10–13 overall (3–9, Big Ten) record during the 1919–20 season, he led the team to an 18–4 overall (8–4, Big Ten) record during the 1920–21 season. This 1921 team won its first eight and last eight games to tie the Wisconsin Badgers and Purdue Boilermakers for the Big Ten title. The team won back-to-back championships in 1925–26 and 1926–27. The 1926 squad, which was captained by Richard Doyle who became the team's first All-American, tied with Purdue, the Iowa Hawkeyes and Indiana Hoosiers for the conference championship. The 1927 team had a new All-American, Bennie Oosterbaan, and won the school's first back-to-back championships and first outright championship with a 14–3 overall (10–2, Big Ten) record. Mather died after a lengthy battle with cancer in August 1928.\nVeenker era (1928–31).\nGeorge F. Veenker compiled the highest overall and highest Big Ten winning percentages of any coach in school history during his three years as coach. He earned 1st(tied), 3rd and 2nd(tied) finishes during his three seasons, which included the 1928–29 conference championship. During Veenker's first season his team compiled a 13–3 overall (10–2, Big Ten) record to win the conference, and Veenker continues to be the only coach in school history to win a conference championship in his first season. The championship team, which finished tied with Wisconsin, was captained by the school's third All-American Ernie McCoy. Veenker resigned to become the Iowa State Cyclones football head coach.\nCappon era (1931–38).\nFranklin Cappon had a long history of association with Michigan athletics starting with his service as a four-time letterman in football and basketball from 1919 to 1923. In 1928, he became assistant football and basketball coach and in 1929 he served as Fielding H. Yost's assistant Athletic Director. Although the highlight of Cappon's tenure as coach was a 16–4 (9–3) third place 1936–37 Big Ten finish, he coached John Townsend who in his 1937–38 senior season became last All-American for at least 10 years. The team finished third in two other seasons with less impressive records of 10–8 overall (8–4, Big Ten) in 1932–33 and 15–5 overall (7–5, Big Ten) 1935–36, and Cappon's overall record was 78–57 overall (44–40, Big Ten). A notable captain during the Cappon era was 1933–34 captain Ted Petoskey, a two-time football All-American end and eventual Major League Baseball player.\nOosterbaan era (1938–46).\nIn 1938 Michigan coaching duties were assumed by one of its greatest athletes. Bennie Oosterbaan had been an All-American in both football and basketball and held various coaching positions at Michigan in both of those sports as well as baseball. In basketball, he implemented a fast-paced attack as coach, and his teams' best overall record was 13–7 in 1939–40. That season he tied with his final season for his best Big Ten record at 6–6. He resigned after eight seasons to concentrate on his football coaching duties.\nCowles era (1946–48).\nUnder Ozzie Cowles, during the 1947–48 season, Michigan ended the longest (19 years) consecutive year period without a conference championship in school history. They also became the first contestants in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament during Cowles second of two seasons. The 1947–48 team posted a 16–6 overall (10–2, Big Ten) record. This team also posted the first undefeated home performance in school history with a 9–0 overall (6–0, Big Ten) record.\nMcCoy era (1948–52).\nErnie McCoy became the second former All-American Wolverine player to coach the team. Like Oosterbaan before him, he became a football and baseball coach at Michigan. He also served as assistant Athletic Director under Fritz Crisler. During his four seasons as basketball coach, Michigan's best finish was during the 1948–49 season when they finished 15–6 overall (7–5, Big Ten) and earned a third place Big Ten Conference finish. He coached Michigan's first All-Big Ten basketball players that season in Pete Elliot and captain Bob Harrison who were both selected to the first team. Harrison returned the following season as the first repeat first-team All-Big Ten basketball player and Elliot was a second-team honoree. McCoy served as a football scout at the same time.\nPerigo era (1952–60).\nBill Perigo took over the Michigan coaching job after having served three seasons as Western Michigan basketball coach. Despite previous success as a conference basketball champion coach at Western and subsequent success as a Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) champion basketball coach, his Michigan teams endured several mediocre seasons. His best Big Ten records came in 1956–57 and 1958–59 when his teams compiled 8–6 conference records. The latter team was tied for second in the conference and was 15–7 overall (8–6, Big Ten). It also had Perigo's only first-team All-Big Ten athlete in M. C. Burton. Team captain and two-time football consensus All-American Ron Kramer was third-team All-Big Ten in 1957 after being second-team All-Big Ten in both 1955 and 1956.\nStrack era (1960–68).\nDave Strack, a former team 1945–46 captain, had become the freshman basketball team coach in 1948 and later had become a variety assistant to Perigo. He led the team to three consecutive Big Ten Championships from 1963 to 1966 and a third-place finish in the 1964 NCAA tournament. During 1964–65 the team compiled a 24–4 overall (13–1, Big Ten) record while completing an undefeated 11–0 overall (7–0, Big Ten) home season and was the national runner-up, falling to John Wooden's UCLA in the 1965 championship game. Strack earned United Press International (UPI) National Coach of the Year honors. The team ended the season listed number one in both the UPI and Associated Press (AP) national rankings. He recruited All-Americans Russell and Buntin to anchor his mid-1960s teams. Tomjanovich also became a Wolverine at the end of Strack's career and became second team All-Big Ten in 1968 subsequent later stardom. The 1964 team, which went 23–5 overall (11–3, Big Ten), tied with Ohio State with sophomore Russell and junior Buntin. In 1965, Buntin became the first Wolverine to be drafted by the NBA. In 1966, Russell led the team to its third straight conference championship and NCAA selection on his way to National Player of the Year honors.\nOrr era (1968–80).\nIn Johnny Orr's twelve seasons, he twice (1973–74 and 1976–77) earned Big Ten Coach of the Year honors with Big Ten championships. His teams earned four consecutive NCAA selections from 1974 to 1977. The 25–7 overall (14–4, Big Ten) 1976 team lost to an undefeated Indiana team in the NCAA championship game and Orr earned National Association of Basketball Coaches Coach of the Year honors that season. The 26–4 overall (16–2, Big Ten) 1977 team finished first in both the AP and UPI national rankings, and Orr won Basketball Weekly National Coach of the Year honors. During Orr's tenure, six players earned a total of seven All-American recognitions, which is the most of any Michigan coach. Steve Grote became Michigan's only three-time first-team Academic All-American from 1975 to 1977 and with a second team All Big Ten as well as three honorable mentions was the first four-time All-Big Ten honoree.\nFrieder era (1980–89).\nBill Frieder, who had been an assistant coach for seven years, took over from Orr in 1980. He coached the school's first post-season basketball champions during the 1983–84 season and the following two teams were back-to-back conference champions. The 1983–84 team compiled a 24–9 overall (11–7, Big Ten) record on their way to a NIT championship victory over Notre Dame. The 1984–85 team went 26–4 overall (16–2, Big Ten), which earned Frieder Big Ten and AP National Coach of the Year honors. The 1985–86 team, which finished 28–5 overall (14–4, Big Ten), started the season with 16 victories to make a total of 33 consecutive regular season victories. Frieder earned five of Michigan's six consecutive NCAA births from 1985 to 1990, currently the longest streak in program history. Roy Tarpley led the 1985 team as Big Ten MVP. After the 1988–89 season, Frieder accepted the head coach's job at Arizona State, but wanted to remain at Michigan for the NCAA tournament. However, when Frieder told athletic director Bo Schembechler of his intentions, Schembechler ordered him to leave immediately, telling him, \"I don't want someone from Arizona State coaching the Michigan team. A \"Michigan\" man is going to coach Michigan.\"\nFisher era (1989–97).\nFrieder's top assistant, Steve Fisher, was named interim coach immediately before the 1989 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and led the team to six straight victories and the championship. Following the victory, Michigan dropped the \"interim\" tag from Fisher's title. Two years later, Fisher signed the famous recruiting class known as the Fab Five (Chris Webber, Juwan Howard, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King and Ray Jackson). He would take these players to the NCAA championship game as Freshmen and Sophomores. Fisher also won the 1997 NIT tournament with a team that compiled a 25–9 overall (11–5) record. Many of Fisher's and the basketball team's accomplishments were tarnished by significant NCAA sanctions. He left the job due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal.\nEllerbe era (1997–2001).\nBrian Ellerbe assumed the title of interim coach less than five months after becoming an assistant coach. He was named full-time coach following the 25–9 (11–5) 1997–98 season in which he led the team to victories over Iowa, Minnesota and Purdue to capture the Big Ten Conference men's basketball tournament championship. His subsequent teams never finished better than seventh in the conference.\nAmaker era (2001–07).\nTommy Amaker inherited a team that imposed sanctions on itself after his first year at the helm of the program. Nonetheless, he coached the team to the postseason three times including both an NIT championship in 2004 and a runner-up finish in 2006. During the 2005–06, when the team compiled a 22–11 overall (8–8, Big Ten) record, he led them to their first national ranking in eight years when they reached the #20 position. Despite his successes, the team never won a Big Ten Championship and never made the NCAA tournament, which led to his firing after six seasons.\nBeilein era (2007–19).\nJohn Beilein's 10–22 overall (5–13 Big Ten) inaugural season featured the second most losses in Michigan's history. However, in Beilein's second season, the team posted impressive non-conference victories over top-five ranked opponents UCLA and Duke. Beilein led Michigan to the 2009 NCAA tournament, its first appearance since 1998 and the first that was not vacated since 1995. After upsetting Clemson in the first round, the Wolverines were eliminated by Oklahoma in Round 2 by a final score of 73–63.\nFollowing a disappointing 15–17 season in 2009–10, the Wolverines bounced back to return to the NCAA tournament in 2011, advancing to the round of 32 before losing to top-seeded Duke, 73–71. The 2010–11 Wolverines, who swept rival Michigan State for the first time since 1997, finished the season 21–14. In the 2011–12 season, Michigan split the season series with both Ohio State and Michigan State and went on to be co-Big Ten champs along with the Buckeyes and Spartans. It was the program's first Big Ten title since 1986. The Wolverines finished the season 24–10 and 13–5 in conference play, losing in the opening round of the NCAA tournament.\nThe 2012–13 Michigan team earned a #1 ranking in the AP Poll on January 28, 2013, marking the first time since November 30, 1992, that Michigan held that position. The team also made program history for the best season start, at 21–2. On March 31, The Wolverines defeated Florida by a score of 79–59 to make their first Final Four appearance since the 1992–93 season. The Wolverines then defeated Syracuse by a score of 61–56 in the Final Four. In the 2013 National Championship game, the Wolverines lost against Louisville by the score of 82–76. On February 20, 2018, NCAA confirmed and upheld penalties against Louisville for \"arranging striptease dances and sex acts for prospects, student-athletes and others.\" Louisville had to vacate its 2013 National Championship but NCAA does not retroactively award vacated championships to default winners.\nThe 2013–14 team had another strong season, winning Michigan's first outright Big Ten championship since 1986 and advancing to the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament, where it lost to Kentucky 75–72. With the departure of several key players to NBA draft and graduation, as well as injuries to Caris LeVert and Derrick Walton, the 2014–15 team ended the season with a 16–16 record and a quarterfinals appearance at the Big Ten tournament but did not make the NCAA tournament. Despite several injuries before and during the season, the 2015–16 team compiled a 23–13 record and made it to the semifinals of the Big Ten tournament. The team also qualified as a First Four for the NCAA tournament but eventually lost at the Round of 64.\nDuring the 2016–17 season, Beilein became the winningest coach in school history, passing Johnny Orr with his 210th win, 75–55 over Illinois on March 9 in the opening round of the 2017 Big Ten tournament. Michigan went on to win the tournament, its first since the vacated 1998 title, winning four games in four days as the #8 seed and capping it off with a 71–56 championship victory over Wisconsin. It was the first time that a #8 seed had won the Big Ten tournament.\nDuring the 2017–18 season, Beilein's Wolverines again won four games in four days to win back-to-back Big Ten tournament championships for the first time in school history. The team went on to win the West regional title and advance to the Final Four following its win over Florida State, 58–54. The win improved the team's record to 32–7, marking a new school record for victories. Following a Final Four victory over a rising Loyola-Chicago team, Michigan moved on to face Villanova in the NCAA tournament championship game. They fell short by a score of 79–62.\nThe 2018–19 team started the season on the best run in program history, winning their first 17 games before losing to Wisconsin on the road. The Wolverines finished the regular season third in the Big Ten and earned a #2 seed in the NCAA tournament, despite losing three starters from the previous season's team. The team made it to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA tournament before losing to #3 seed Texas Tech. This marked the third consecutive season that the team advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA tournament.\nOn May 13, 2019, in a surprising move, Beilein signed a five-year contract to become the head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers. Beilein led Michigan to a 278–150 record with nine NCAA tournament appearances, including two finishes as national runner-ups. Beilein has advocated for a system similar to college football, where a committed player has to stay in school for at least three years. It was speculated that the rise of \"one-and-done\" and early NBA Draft entries, which resulted in a trend of more time spent on recruiting and higher turnover of players, has contributed to Beilein decision to leave coaching college basketball. Beilein's departure from Michigan is widely regarded as a loss to college basketball.\nHoward era (2019–2024).\nOn May 22, 2019, former Fab Five member Juwan Howard was named the head coach of the Wolverines, agreeing on a five-year contract. Despite losing three leading scorers from the 2018 team to NBA draft, Howard led the unranked Wolverines to a strong 7–0 start, including back-to-back wins over then #6 ranked UNC (73–64) and #8 ranked Gonzaga (82–64) to capture the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament title on November 29, 2019. Following the strong performance, Michigan jumped from unranked to #4 in the AP Top 25 on December 2, 2019, becoming only the second team after the 1989–90 Kansas Jayhawks to achieve the feat in the 70-year history of the poll since its creation in 1949. In their first Big Ten opener under Howard on December 6, 2019, the Wolverines defeated Iowa 103–91 and scored their most points in a Big Ten game since 1998 (112 against Indiana). They achieved the 9 seed in the 2020 Big Ten tournament, but their first game, against 8 seed Rutgers, was cancelled just hours before the game due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn March 4, 2021, the Wolverines clinched the regular-season Big Ten Championship with a 69–50 victory over instate rival Michigan State. On March 8, 2021, Michigan lost to Michigan State, ending the season with a 23–5 overall record, 14–3 conference record and a .823 conference winning percentage. Michigan's winning percentage earned it a Big Ten regular season championship, its first since 2014 and the first of the Howard era. The Wolverines received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as the No. 1 seed in the East region, where they defeated Texas Southern and LSU to advance to their fourth straight Sweet Sixteen. They then defeated Florida State before being upset by No. 11-seeded UCLA in the Elite Eight. \nOn March 15, 2024, Michigan announced they were parting ways with Howard after five years of coaching.\nRivalries.\nRecord against Big Ten opponents.\nTotals through March 13, 2024\nFab Five.\nThe Fab Five, the 1991 recruiting class of five freshman starters, were Chris Webber, Juwan Howard, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King, and Ray Jackson. They were notable for having gone to the championship game of the 1992 and 1993 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as freshmen and sophomores, for having started the trend of wearing baggy gym shorts, which was later popularized by Michael Jordan, and for wearing black athletic socks. Due to the Ed Martin scandal, the records from their 1992 Final Four appearance and the entire following season have been forfeited. Although Webber was the only member of the Fab Five officially implicated with the scandal, the reputation of the whole group has been tarnished. Webber (1993), Howard (1994) and Rose (1992, 1994) were college basketball All-Americans. and both King (1995 3rd team and 1993 &amp; 1994 honorable mention) and Jackson (1995 2nd team &amp; 1994 honorable mention) achieved All-Big Ten honors. All but Jackson played in the NBA. They were the subject of Mitch Albom's book entitled \"Fab Five: Basketball, Trash Talk, the American Dream\", which at one point was under development by Fox Television as a made-for-television movie. In March 2011 ESPN broadcast a documentary, \"Fab Five\", that was the network's highest-rated in its history.\nEd Martin scandal.\nDuring the University of Michigan basketball scandal the Big Ten Conference, National Collegiate Athletic Association, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, and United States Department of Justice investigated the relationship between the University of Michigan, its men's basketball teams and basketball team booster Ed Martin. The program was punished for NCAA rules violations, principally involving payments booster Martin made to several players to launder money from an illegal gambling operation. It is one of the largest incidents involving payments to college athletes in American collegiate history. It was described as one of the three or four worst violations of NCAA bylaws in history up to that time by the NCAA infractions committee chairman and the largest athlete payment scandal ever by ESPN.\nThe case began when the investigation of an automobile rollover accident during Mateen Cleaves' 1996 Michigan Wolverines recruiting trip revealed a curious relationship between Martin and the team. Several Michigan basketball players were implicated over the next few years and by 1999 several were called before a federal grand jury. Four eventual professional basketball players (Chris Webber, Maurice Taylor, Robert Traylor and Louis Bullock) were discovered to have borrowed a total of $616,000 from Martin. During the investigation, Webber claimed not to have had any financial relationship with Martin. Eventually he confessed to having accepted some of the money he was charged with having borrowed. For his perjury during a federal grand jury investigation, he was both fined in the legal system and briefly suspended by National Basketball Association after performing public service.\nIn 2002, the university punished itself when it became apparent that its players were guilty by declaring itself ineligible for post season play immediately, returning post season play monetary rewards, vacating five seasons of games, removing commemorative banners, and placing itself on a two-year probation. The following year, the NCAA accepted these punishments, doubled both the probation period and the post-season ineligibility, penalized the school one scholarship for four seasons, and ordered disassociation from the four guilty players until 2012. The disassociation formally ended on May 8, 2013. The additional year of post-season ineligibility was overturned on appeal.\nThe punishment cost the 17–13 2002–03 team its post-season eligibility, cost past teams the 1997 National Invitation tournament and the 1998 Big Ten tournament championships as well as 1992 and 1993 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament Final Four recognition. It cost Traylor his MVP awards in the 1997 NIT and 1998 Big Ten tournament, as well as Bullock's standing as the school's third all-time leading scorer and all-time leader in 3-point field goals. Steve Fisher lost his job as Michigan head coach as a result of the scandal.\nHonored players and coaches.\nBelow are lists of important players and coaches in the history of Michigan Wolverines men's basketball. It includes lists of major awards and retired numbers. The honors include: Helms Foundation Player of the Year, UPI Player of the Year, Sporting News Player of the Year, Naismith Trophy, Wooden Award, Associated Press Player of the Year, NABC Player of the Year, Oscar Robertson Trophy, NCAA tournament MOP, National Invitation tournament MVP, Big Ten tournament MVP, Chicago Tribune Silver Basketball, Big Ten Player of the Year, All-America, Wayman Tisdale Award, Bob Cousy Award, UPI Coach of the Year, Henry Iba Award, NABC Coach of the Year, AP Coach of the Year.\nRetired numbers.\nThe program has officially retired one number only:\nHonored Jerseys.\nJerseys honored but numbers still active:\nAwards and honors.\nNational Player of the Year\nWayman Tisdale Award\nBob Cousy Award\nNCAA tournament MOP\nNational Invitation Tournament MVP\nBig Ten tournament MVP\nChicago Tribune Silver Basketball\nBig Ten Player of the Year\nBig Ten Freshman of the Year\nBig Ten Defensive Player of the Year\nBig Ten Sixth Man of the Year\nAll-Americans\nNational Coach of the Year \nBig Ten Coach of the Year\nNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famers.\nTwo former Wolverines have been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe University of Michigan has an all-time 66–30* (59–27) record overall and 1–6* (1–4) championship game record in the NCAA tournaments in 31* (28) appearances.

        "title": "PDC World Championship Darts",
        "text": "PDC World Championship Darts is a sports video game published by Oxygen Interactive and developed and designed by Mere Mortals. It was released for the PlayStation 2 and PC. The game features ten professionals from the Professional Darts Corporation, and five tournaments from the PDC circuit. A sequel, \"PDC World Championship Darts 2008\", was produced the following year.\nGameplay.\nThe game attempts to recreate playing real darts through the functions of the controller and the rules set within the game. A variety of modes are available for play.\nRules.\n\"See also Playing darts and Scoring for full rules\"\nThe game almost exactly follows the rules of the classic 501 darts game. Two professionals (one or two controlled by the player) throw darts onto the dartboard to decrease their score to 0, but they must end with a double. The only exception is the World Grand Prix where players must also start with a double. The dartboard's numbers are positioned just as they are in real darts.\nEach player throws three darts at a time before the next player's turn. In standard rules, whoever reaches 0 first has won the leg. Varying amounts of legs comprise sets, a certain amount of which must be gained to win the match.\nControls.\nAfter aiming where they want to throw with the right analog stick, the player uses the left analog stick on the DualShock 2 controller or keyboard to pull back their dart and increase the power behind the throw. In 'Amateur' mode the power can be seen with a red bar that fills a power meter; in 'Professional' mode this aid is not present and the power can be seen via the movement of the character's arm. Once the desired amount of power is reached, pushing forward on the analog stick will throw the dart. Any deviation to the left or right while throwing the dart will also affect the dart's flight.\nModes.\nThere are numerous modes of play within the game. Aside from a simple Exhibition between one or two players, a single player can also create their own character and begin a career to become the world's best dart player. Another mode allows any of the tournaments in career mode to be played individually.\nParty Games.\nThere are 10 party games available to play for two to four players. Instead of using the usual control style where the player manually aims and adjusts their power, all of these games must be played in one of three control mechanisms that generally involve the player confirming where they want to throw at just the right time as the aiming cursor moves around the board. This is to suit the sort of games that party mode contains:\nProfessionals.\nTen professionals are included in the game (listed along with their achievements at the time of production):\nTournaments.\nFive official PDC tournaments are included in the game. They can be played individually or chronologically as in Career mode, and tournament progress can be saved between rounds. All tournaments are standard 501 double-out games except where noted."

The first match between the Federated Malay States and Straits Settlements was played in 1905 and the combined Malaya team first played the following year, against Burma in Yangon, though the result is not known. Two matches were played against Australia in 1909.\nBeginning in 1920, Malaya replaced the Straits Settlements in a regular series of Interport matches against Hong Kong. In November of that year, they traveled to Hong Kong, playing matches against Hong Kong and Shanghai. They beat Hong Kong by 35 runs, but lost to Shanghai by an innings and 140 runs. Following these two matches, they joined forces with the Shanghai team to lose to Hong Kong by five wickets. The visit was repeated in November 1924, with Malaya losing to Shanghai by 89 runs and to Hong Kong by 2 wickets. They played Hong Kong at home in 1926, beating them by an innings and 112 runs on the Padang in Singapore.\nIn June 1927, Australia, captained by Bert Oldfield, visited Malaya, and the Malayan side won the first match by 39 runs, their only win against a Test-playing nation. A third visit to Hong Kong was made in November that year, with Malaya losing by an innings to Shanghai and Hong Kong. In 1929, they lost to Shanghai by 1 wicket, and to Hong Kong by four wickets. The final visit in 1933 saw Malaya beat Hong Kong by 14 runs, before gaining their first win over Shanghai by beating them by 50 runs.\nLater matches.\nLittle is known of Malaya's matches after World War II.

Smith trained in Melbourne, but flew back to Brisbane on weekends to play with the Storm's feeder club, Norths Devils, in the Queensland Cup competition.\nSmith was re-instated on the wing before the 1999 semi-final series when coach Chris Anderson dropped his son Ben and moved Geyer to . Anderson also made Smith the primary goal-kicker. Smith's boot proved the difference in three sudden-death victories, culminating in his three goals and penalty try from the wing in the 1999 NRL Grand Final, despite playing with knee injuries and a broken rotator cuff in his shoulder.\nSmith rejected Melbourne's offer for the 2000 NRL season and retired. After moving to Perth where he lived for many years, he now lives back in Melbourne.\nIn 2017, Smith spoke about his time in rugby league saying \"We were walking around in Melbourne and were three times the size of everyone else, that is how they knew who the rugby league players were back then, nobody knew anything about the sport. At our first game they were cheering and I don’t think they knew what they were cheering about\"."

        "text": "Ryan Watson (born June 12, 1981) is a Canadian-born Italian former professional ice hockey player. He played the prime of his career in Italy's Serie A.\nPlaying career.\nWatson began his career in 1998 playing for his local team, the Lethbridge Hurricanes at junior level in the WHL. Watson did not start particularly well though, and managed just one point in 22 games in his first season.\nFor the 2000–01 season, Watson played at the lower junior level of the AJHL for the Drayton Valley Thunder. His performances were much improved, and a ratio of over a point per game was established during a season in which Watson played almost 60 times totalling over 100 points.\nWatson began his professional career with the Oklahoma City Blazers of the CHL. He settled well and established himself as an important first team player, turning out in 118 games in the two seasons, and totalling 74 points in that time. His performances brought him to the attention of the Victoria Salmon Kings. The Salmon Kings signed Watson for the 2004–05 season. Watson managed 33 games and 29 points.\nDespite his positive points return, he did not re-sign with the Salmon Kings and so returned to the CHL with the then named Memphis Riverkings. Watson again proved his quality, totalling 59 points in 64 games. In the summer of 2006, Watson moved to Europe and was signed by the Manchester Phoenix of the EIHL, the highest tier of club hockey in Britain. However, Watson played in only 10 games for the Phoenix before returning to North America.\nOn his return he re-signed for one of his old teams, the Oklahoma City Blazers. Watson continued to score points regularly for the Blazers throughout both the regular and post-season periods, managing a point per game ratio. This productivity meant that the Blazers re-signed Watson for the 2007–08 season. It was again a positive season for Watson, who scored 55 points in 63 games.\nHe returned to Europe and Italy to sign for Cortina SG of the Serie A. Despite the language barrier, Watson settled well and began once again to clock up regular goals and assists. Watson began to play for the Italian nation team and became a pivotal player in there success to winning a world championship. After four seasons in Italy, Watson announced his retirement from professional hockey at the conclusion of the 2011–12 season, finishing his career with three world championships, multiple team championships and individual awards. After retirement Watson was inducted into the Lethbridge Sports Hall of Fame in 2013."

        "title": "1986 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 1986 Rose Bowl was a college football bowl game played on January 1, 1986. It was the 72nd edition and was held at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. The UCLA Bruins upset the Iowa Hawkeyes 45–28. UCLA tailback Eric Ball was named the Player Of The Game. He ran for a Rose Bowl record four touchdowns.\nPre-game activities.\nOn Tuesday, October 22, 1985, the Rose Queen selection ceremony took place at Tournament House in Pasadena when 17-year-old Aimee Lynn Richelieu, a senior at San Marino High School and a resident of San Marino, California, was named the 68th Rose Queen to reign over the 97th Rose Parade and the 72nd Rose Bowl Game. On Thursday, October 24, the Coronation occurred at the Wrigley Mansion, when the 1985–86 Tournament of Roses President, Frederick D. Johnson, Jr., placed the Queen's Crown on Miss Richelieu's head and a dozen roses in her arms to start her year-long reign.\nThe game was presided over by the 1986 Tournament of Roses Royal Court and Rose Parade Grand Marshal Erma Bombeck. Members of the court are: Princesses Shannon Guernsey, Altadena; Christine Huff, Altadena; April Lake, Arcadia; Tracey Langford, Pasadena; Julene Penner, Pasadena; and Loreen Weeks, Sierra Madre.\nTeams.\nThe 1986 Rose Bowl matched the winners of the Big Ten Conference and the Pacific-10 Conference. Each conference had tie-breaker rules in place should there be conference co-champions.\nIowa.\nIowa spent most of the season ranked in the top five, and five weeks ranked number one in the nation. On October 19, 1985, they defeated the #2 Michigan Wolverines 12–10 in the thirteenth regular season matchup between a #1 and #2 team. Mike Haight, Chuck Long, and Ronnie Harmon were the stars for the Hawkeyes. They eventually lost one game, on November 2 to Ohio State, 13–22. Iowa came into the 1986 Rose bowl game with a record of 10–1.\nAfter much consideration, Chuck Long delighted Iowa Hawkeye fans by declaring that he would return for his senior season. The rest of the 1984 team returning off a win in the 1984 Freedom Bowl also vowed to return. Long became an instant Heisman Trophy candidate, and Iowa was a pre-season top five team. On September 28, the Hawkeyes crushed the in-state rival Iowa State Cyclones 57-3. In the October 1, 1985 poll, the Hawkeyes ascended to #1 in the national rankings. \nIn Iowa's first game at #1, the Hawkeyes played Michigan State. A seesaw game had the Spartans leading 31–28 in the waning minutes. Long drove Iowa the length of the field, and the Hawkeyes faced fourth and goal from the two-yard line with just 27 seconds remaining. Since there was no overtime rule until 1996, Iowa needed to go for the touchdown and the win. Long faked a handoff to running back Harmon and then ran to his right. His fake had fooled the Spartan defenders, and Long ran into the endzone, holding the ball high above his head as he crossed the goal line to give Iowa a 35–31 victory. He completed a school record 30 passes on 39 attempts for 380 yards and scored five touchdowns (four passing and the game winning score rushing) in the game.\nTwo weeks later, #1 Iowa faced #2 Michigan in Kinnick Stadium. Iowa trailed 10-9 as the Hawkeyes regained possession of the football at their own 22-yard line with just 5:27 remaining in the game. Long led Iowa on a 66-yard drive against the nation's top-ranked defense, twice converting third-and-eight situations by completing passes to tight end Mike Flagg. Long drove the Iowa team to the 12-yard line with two seconds remaining to set up kicker Rob Houghtlin's game-winning field goal as time expired. Long completed 26 of 39 passes for 297 yards in Iowa's 12–10 win.\nTheir only loss, at Ohio State in early November, cost Iowa the #1 ranking, but the Hawkeyes still won the Big Ten title outright for the first time in 27 years. Long won many major national awards as a senior, including the 1985 Maxwell Award, given to the nation's top player and the Davey O'Brien Award, given to the nation's top quarterback. He was the Big Ten Player of the Year and a consensus first team All-American. Finally, Long was the runner-up in the balloting for the Heisman Trophy to Bo Jackson of Auburn in the closest margin to date, losing by just 45 points. Larry Station was a first team all-American.\nUCLA.\nUCLA defeated defending national champion BYU 27–24 in Provo to start the season, and tied eventual SEC and Sugar Bowl champion Tennessee. The Bruins opened the Pac-10 season by losing 21–14 at Washington. They later got two key wins, the first against Arizona State, the second at Arizona. For much of the season, the rushing defense was ranked second in the nation, behind Oklahoma. They won the rest of their games leading to the 1985 USC vs UCLA game.\nNeeding a win against 4–5 USC, UCLA struggled. Gaston Green and Mel Farr Jr. had fumbles in the game. UCLA was leading in the fourth quarter 13–10 when Eric Ball fumbled at the USC 1 as he was about to score what would have been the clinching touchdown. Freshman quarterback Rodney Peete led USC on a drive, converting a key fourth down along the way. In the last two minutes, USC again faced a fourth down, this time at UCLA's 2-yard line. USC scored to take a 17–13 lead, then intercepted UCLA quarterback David Norrie as he tried to lead a Bruin comeback. UCLA's loss opened the door for Washington to grab the Rose Bowl berth, but they were upset by Washington State the same day, 21–20. Washington lost the advantage due to their upset home loss to Oregon State. This put Arizona State in position to win the conference as they entered their rivalry game with Arizona with only one conference loss (40–17 to UCLA). But later that evening, Arizona defeated Arizona State 16–13 to cause a tie between UCLA, Arizona State, and Arizona. UCLA won the tiebreaker and the Rose Bowl berth by virtue of its wins over Arizona and Arizona State.\nUCLA came into New Year's with a record of 8–2–1, and head coach Terry Donahue had been named Pac-10 Coach of the year. Five Bruin players were first team All-Pac-10: defensive tackle Mark Walen, offensive tackle Mike Hartmeier, kicker John Lee, nose guard Terry Tumey, and inside linebacker Tommy Taylor. Walen was named Pac-10 defensive player of the year. UCLA finished ranked #1 in the nation in rushing defense, at 70.3 yards per game. Oklahoma was second with 89.9 yards per game.\nGame summary.\nThe weather was overcast and . The UCLA Bruins wore white visitor jerseys, and the Iowa Hawkeyes wore their black home jerseys. Both teams wore Rose Bowl patches on their uniforms. The Iowa Hawkeye helmets bore a sticker with the letters \"ANF\" for \"America Needs Farmers\". Coach Hayden Fry had the players wear these stickers to bring attention the plight of American farmers.\nScoring.\nFourth quarter.\nHoughtlin tied the record for longest field goal made in the Rose Bowl.\nAftermath.\nFinal polls.\nIowa missed an outside shot at the final #1 ranking, with #2 Miami losing to Tennessee 35–7 in the Sugar Bowl and #3 Oklahoma defeating #1 Penn State 25–10 in the Orange Bowl. Oklahoma had leapfrogged Iowa on December 10 in the poll. Michigan finished at #2 after their Fiesta Bowl win, the highest final poll ranking ever achieved by Michigan coach Bo Schembechler. The Hawkeyes finished at #10 in the AP poll #9 in the coaches poll. The UCLA Bruins finished at #7 in the AP poll and #6 in the coaches poll, their highest ranking of the season.\nTelevision ratings.\nThis game had a 22.7 television ratings share. Through 2007, only the 1987 Fiesta Bowl game has a higher U.S. television rating at 24.9. Only the 1988 Orange Bowl at a 20.8 and the 2006 Rose Bowl at a 21.7 have over a 20 share since the 1986 Rose Bowl.\nChuck Long.\nThough Iowa lost in Chuck Long's final game in the 1986 Rose Bowl a 45–28 loss to UCLA, the loophole with the redshirting rule allowed Long to play in his fifth bowl game. He is believed to be the only collegiate player to participate in five bowl games. Long's Iowa teams compiled a 35-13-1 record. He graduated with 10,461 passing yards and 74 touchdowns on 782 completions. He held every passing record at the University of Iowa except one (passes attempted in a game) when he graduated. Long holds the best completion percentage of any college quarterback all-time who has attempted more than 1,000 career passes. He was also the first Big Ten player and just the second player in college football history to throw for more than 10,000 yards in a career. Chuck Long was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1999 and the Iowa Sports Hall of Fame in 2001.\nRonnie Harmon.\nIt has been implied that Harmon was actually throwing the game with the fumbles and dropped pass. Coach Hayden Fry commented on the issue in his book \"High Porch Picnic\": \n\"Harmon took a lot of heat because he lost four fumbles, all in the first half. That was uncharacteristic of him; I think he fumbled once during the regular season. The game film reveals that every fumble he lost was caused by a UCLA defender making a hard hit. They just knocked the ball loose. They [UCLA] did a great job of tackling. UCLA made bad things happen to Iowa; Iowa didn’t self-destruct. Ronnie Harmon had a tremendous football career with the Hawkeyes, and I hated to see it end that way.\"\nHarmon had 14 carries for a total of 55 yards.\nTerry Donahue.\nThis was Donahue's third and final win in the Rose Bowl Game. It was the fourth New Year's Day win in a row for Donahue and the Bruins. It would culminate in an NCAA record seven straight bowl game wins for Donahue and the Bruins following the 1989 Cotton Bowl. Donahue coached in 13 bowl games, second only in the Pac-10 to Don James' 14 bowl games. As of the 2023 season, the Bruins have not won again in the Rose Bowl game.\nFuture NFL players.\nFuture NFL Players James Washington, Mike Sherrard, Mark Walen, Ken Norton, Jr., Jim Wahler, Carnell Lake, Darryl Henley, Chuck Long, Ronnie Harmon, Larry Station, Devon Mitchell, Mel Farr Jr., Mike Farr, and Mike Haight played in this game.\nFuture head coaches.\nBill Snyder, Barry Alvarez, Kirk Ferentz, Dan McCarney, Don Patterson, and Bob Stoops were assistant coaches for Hayden Fry on this Iowa team that would all later became head coaches."

They participated in qualifiers for the 1991 Rugby World Cup, but did not qualify.\nHistory.\nA Czechoslovak international team including players from an Austrian club called Wiener Amateure as well as players from the Slavia Bratislava club first played against Romania in 1927, but the match is seen as unofficial, since the Czechoslovak Rugby Union was only formed in 1928. They were captained by one František Ruber, who incidentally was a very good friend of Ondřej Sekora. Their first official match was against Germany in Leipzig in 1931.\nIn 1934 they were among the founding members of FIRA (as it was then known) along with France, Italy, Spain, Catalonia, Romania and Germany.\nIn 1956 they took on European giants France in Toulouse, losing by a respectable 3–28, which is rather remarkable, as rugby in Czechoslovakia was considerably ravaged by World War II.\nSome of their most notable players were Zdeněk Barchánek, Eduard Krützner, who was president of the Czech Rugby Union later on and Bruno Kudrna, Czech Rugby Player of the Year a record six times."

He was born in Jabalpur, India. In his home state of Western Australia, he played as a striker for 19 years.\nPlaying career.\nEric is one of five international-level hockey playing brothers, the others being Cec, Mel, Gordon and Julian. His daughter Colleen Pearce was part of the Australian national hockey team that came third at the 1983 World Cup and fourth at the 1984 Olympics. He is considered to be one of the finest field hockey players to have represented Australia.\nFollowing the partition of India, his father Cec and elder brothers Cec and Mel settled in Perth, Western Australia in 1947. His mother Gladys, Eric and his two other brothers followed in the following year. The Anglo-Indian family had intended on settling in Victoria but instead chose to stay in Western Australia.\nIn the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne he joined with Gordon and Mel in the Australian team. He also competed in 1960 Olympics in Rome, the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo (Australia's first Olympic hockey medal - bronze) and the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City (silver). Eric was the Australian team flag-bearer at the 1968 Games. In the 1964 Games he scored Australia's only two goals allowing his team to beat Pakistan (2-1) for the first time. In the 1968 Games he scored all eight goals in one match against Japan (8-1), his biggest tally in an international match.\nPearce played in 12 national championships for Western Australia, winning seven, largely due to his own goal scoring abilities. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame as a founding member in 1985 - the only hockey player to have been selected. He was inducted into the Western Australian Hall of Champions in 1986."

        "title": "History of the Highlanders (rugby union)",
        "text": "The history of the Highlanders focuses on the rugby union team in the Super Rugby competitions. The team was originally formed as one of five New Zealand franchises for the Super 12 in 1996. The team encompassed the provinces of North Otago, Otago and Southland. The Highlanders placed eighth in their first year with five wins, but slumped to last in the competition in 1997 with only three wins. They improved to qualify for their first semi-final in 1998, and became the first New Zealand team to defeat all four South African franchises in the process. They were defeated by eventual 1998 Champions the Auckland Blues in their semi-final however. Their best ever finish came in 1999 when they won eight matches, and their semi-final to host the 1999 Super 12 Final at Carisbrook, but lost to South Island rivals Crusaders in the match. They qualified for their third consecutive semi-finals in 2000, and this time played the Crusaders in Christchurch, but lost again.\nIn 2001 they could not repeat a play-off performance, they did finish fifth and maintain an unbeaten record at Carisbrook for the second season in a row. In 2002 the Gordon Hunter Memorial Trophy was introduced to be contested with the Blues, and the Highlanders won the trophy with a 20–13 win at Eden Park. They did this on their way to finishing fourth, before again losing to the Crusaders in their semi-final. In 2003 they lost their first match at Carisbrook since the 1999 Super 12 final when the Crusaders defeated them 17–16. Coach Laurie Mains resigned at the end of that season after a dispute with some of the senior players, including Anton Oliver. In 2004, their first season with coach Greg Cooper, they finished ninth despite scoring more tries then in 2003. This was mainly due to their defence as they conceded 12 more tries then in 2003. Despite winning six consecutive games in 2005, they eventually finished eighth due to losing their last three matches.\nAfter the expansion of the Super 12 to the Super 14 with the addition of two teams—one each from Australia and South Africa. In both the 2006 and 2007 seasons the Highlander's finished ninth with 27 competition points when they won six and five matches respectively. Following their 2007 season coach Greg Cooper left the franchise, and was replaced by Glenn Moore. Moore coached the team for three seasons, but achieved only ten wins during that time, and finished no higher than ninth. Jamie Joseph was appointed coach for the 2011 season, and under him finished eighth that season, and ninth the following year.\nOrigin of name.\nThe name \"Highlanders\" was chosen after the early Scottish settlers in the lower South Island. These Scottish settlers were the founders of Dunedin—known as the \"Edinburgh of the South\", and the city where the Highlanders are based. According to the Highlanders official website: \" The name and image of the Highlander conjures up visions of fierce independence, pride in one's roots, loyalty, strength, kinship, honesty, and hard work.\" The colours of the Highlanders encompasses the provincial colours of North Otago, Otago, and Southland; yellow, blue and maroon. Blue is also the predominant colour of the Flag of Scotland, and is used by many sports teams in that country.\nBeginnings: 1996 and 1997.\nThe Highlanders' franchise was created as one of five New Zealand teams in the Super 12. Originally named the Otago Highlanders, the Highlanders' franchise area encompassed the lower South Island of New Zealand (see Super 14 franchise areas), and was formed from the North Otago, Otago, and Southland provincial rugby unions.\nThe 1996 team was captained by John Leslie and coached by Gordon Hunter. Their first-ever Super 12 match was against the Queensland Reds at Carisbrook on 3 March 1996. Queensland were one of the competition favourites as they had won the 1994 and 1995 Super 10 championships (amateur predecessor of the Super 12) yet were defeated 57–17. They then defeated Transvaal 29–15 at Carisbrook before travelling to South Africa to defeat Western Province 52–25 in Cape Town. After three matches the Highlanders were undefeated and leading the competition. However, the following week at Loftus Versfeld Stadium they were defeated 59–29 by Northern Transvaal. They only won two more games that season; against at Carisbrook, and against the Canterbury Crusaders at Lancaster Park. The win over the Crusaders was their only ever win in Christchurch. The Highlanders finished the season eighth on the table, and third out of the five New Zealand teams.\nThe 1997 was the least successful season ever for the Highlanders. They finished last, and managed only three wins. They spent their pre-season playing in Scotland and England where they won all seven matches. Carl Hoeft said of the pre-season; \"Looking back now, it's safe to say it wasn't probably the best way we could have prepared. Even now, people think were crazy when I tell them what we did\". They were now coached by Glenn Ross and captained by Taine Randell. Their eight defeats that season included a 75–43 defeat by Natal in Durban. The points scored by Natal included 50 points by Gavin Lawless—a competition record. Their three victories that season included defeating the Canterbury Crusaders at Carisbrook, and the Waikato Chiefs at Taupo—where Doug Howlett scored three tries for the Highlanders.\nPlayoffs: 1998–2000.\nFollowing their last place in the 1997 season, Tony Gilbert was appointed coach. Before the season began the Otago Highlanders were rated 100 to 1 odds of winning the competition in 1998. Their first game was against the Queensland Reds—who had finished in the top four in 1997—who they upset 26–19. Although they lost to the ACT Brumbies and then the Auckland Blues in rounds two and three, they then defeated 1997 finalists the Sharks in round four. They eventually became the first New Zealand side to defeat all four South African teams in one season (the Crusaders achieved the same feat one day later).\nTheir last two matches were in South Africa where they needed to get maximum competition points to qualify for the semii-finals. They defeated both the Stormers then the Bulls to get ten points from the two games. Winger Jeff Wilson scored five tries over the two games to help them achieve this. After defeating the Bulls at Loftus Versfeld they needed the Queensland Reds to not get a bonus point win, and not win by 14 points or more in order to stay in the top four. Queensland were defeated by the Brumbies 23–16 and the Highlanders finished fourth—qualifying for the semi-finals. They faced defending champions the Auckland Blues at Eden Park. The Blues were leading 20–16 at halftime, and were leading 30–26 before a controversial try to Adrian Cashmore pushed the Blues to a 37–26 lead. Joeli Vidiri had illegally taken out Highlander Stanley off the ball. Sharks' coach Ian McIntosh stated that: \"Incorrect refereeing decisions cost both semi-finals\" and that \"The Highlanders conceded a try they shouldn't have\".\nThe following season in 1999 the Highlanders superseded their 1997 season by hosting the tournament final. Otago had won the 1998 National Provincial Championship and the Highlanders carried that success on into the Super 12. They opened their season with a 19–13 victory over the Auckland Blues at Carisbrook. This was followed by a victory over the Northern Bulls in Invercargill, and then a 46–14 victory over the Stormers at Carisbrook. They then travelled to South Africa where they defeated the Cats before losing their first loss of the season to the Sharks in Durban. They returned to New Zealand to defeat the Waikato Chiefs and then the Crusaders. After defeating the Reds, the Highlanders lost to the New South Wales Waratahs at Carisbrook. The next week they defeated the Brumbies at the same venue.\nNext they had their bye round, before facing the Wellington Hurricanes at Athletic Park. Despite leading 14–3 at half time, the Highlanders lost when Hurricanes' half-back Jason Spice scored in the corner to give the Hurricanes a 21–19 victory. Had the Highlanders won they would have finished top of the table and hosted a semi-final at Carisbrook. Instead they then had to travel from Wellington to South Africa to play the Stormers. After trailing 11–0, the Highlanders finished the first half ahead 22–18. They scored a further 11 points in the second half to win 33–18. The Highlanders travelled back to Dunedin and the match was moved to the Sunday to allow an extra for recovery. The 1999 Super 12 Final was against South Island rivals the Canterbury Crusaders, and was billed as \"the party at Tony Brown's house\" after Highlanders first five-eighth Tony Brown. The match in front of a sellout 41,500 person crowd the Highlanders scored first, and led 14–9 at half time. However, the decisive try was to Crusaders' wing Afato So'oalo when he chipped the ball, then out-sprinted All Blacks winger Jeff Wilson to collect the ball and score. Although the Highlanders' scored a try to Isitolo Maka with three minutes remaining the Crusaders won 24–19.\nFor the 2000 season Peter Sloane became coach after Tony Gilbert was appointed as the All Blacks' forwards coach. They opened their season with a 50–13 victory over Queensland Reds at Carisbrook; the second time the Reds had conceded 50 points to the Highlanders. They won their next three matches, against the Sharks, Hurricanes and Cats. However, the then lost their following three; against the Crusaders, Brumbies, and Blues. At the end of the regular season they had won six of their eleven games, and finished third due to a superior points difference to the fourth placed Cats. They played the Crusaders at Jade Stadium in their semi-final, and were defeated 37–15 after Marika Vunibaka scored two tries in the last 20 minutes.\nMixed success: 2001–2005.\nThe Highlanders again opened their season with a victory at Carisbrook; this time a 23–8 victory over the Blues. After losing to the Cats in Johannesburg and the Sharks in Durban, they returned to Carisbrook with a one-point victory over the Stormers. Their 39–20 defeat of the Waratahs at Carisbrook on 7 April was the first defeat of New South Wales by an Otago-based side since the Otago provincial team defeated New South Wales 5–0 in 1901. They narrowly lost to the Hurricanes in Napier 35–33 before defeating the Brumbies at Carisbrook on 20 April. After a loss to Queensland they finished their season with a 26–21 defeat of the defending champion Crusaders at Carisbrook. Although the Highlanders went undefeated at home for a second consecutive season, the Highlanders finished fifth with six wins that season.\nLaurie Mains had returned from South Africa to coach Otago in the 2001 NPC, and after Peter Sloane moved to the Blues, Mains was appointed the Highlanders coach for 2002. Their season started with a narrow 30–28 loss to the Crusaders at Jade Stadium, after leading 28–27 at one point. That year the Highlanders also achieved a win over all four South African teams; a Grand Slam that they had not achieved since 1998. The closest of those four victories was a 21–20 win over the Stormers in Cape Town. They also defeated the Brumbies 25–18 in Canberra, The Gordon Hunter Memorial Trophy was also introduced that season to be contested between the Highlanders and Blues. Gordon Hunter had coached both teams before dying from cancer in 2001. Highland prop said of the game against the Blues \"While I’m sure Gordy was popular in Auckland during his time coaching up there, as he’d seemed to be everywhere he went, the trophy meant a huge amount to us and we were determined to be the first winners to honour his memory\". The match was played at Eden Park, and the Highlanders were ahead 15–3 at half time, and eventually won 20–13. Their last home match of the season was against the Reds at Carisbrook. The Highlanders’ 40–26 win meant that they had gone three seasons undefeated at Carisbrook. With their eight victories from the regular season, the Highlanders finished fourth and played the Crusaders in Christchurch in their semi-final. The Crusaders won 34–23 although Jeff Wilson did score a try in his last match for the franchise.\nThe 2003 season started with a 29–16 win over the Chiefs in Hamilton. The win was notable because Highlander Willie Walker kicked eight penalties— which was a competition record. They then defeated the Stormers and Bulls before losing to coach Laurie Mains’ old team the Cats in Johannesburg. Winger Aisea Tuilevu was banned for foul play following the match, and Highlander's captain Tane Randell publicly criticised the South African judicial process. Their second loss of the season came when they played the Crusaders at Carisbrook. The Crusaders won 17–16 to record to first loss for the Highlanders at Carisbrook since the 1999 final—which was also lost to the Crusaders. The Highlanders had gone three seasons, 2000, 2001 and 2002, and 16 games unbeaten at Carisbrook. The Highlanders then defeated the Blues 22–11 to retain the Gordon Hunter Memorial Trophy, and inflict the only loss of the season on the Blues who would go on to win the 2003 Championship. Following the Highlander's 45–19 defeat of the Brumbies on 25 April it was revealed that a rift had developed between coach Laurie Mains and some of the senior players in the squad. Anton Oliver was branded the ringleader by Mains, but Carl Hoeft said of the conflict; \"Anton got hung out as ringleader, but a lot of the players had issues with the way things were going and I was one of them—I’m not going to hide from that\". The Highlanders lost to the Waratahs at Carisbrook on 3 May, but were in a position to qualify for the semi-finals if they defeated the Queensland Reds in the last round. The Reds won 28–23 and their season was over. The defeat was Mains’ last match as coach; he resigned as was replaced by his assistant Greg Cooper.\nIn contrast to their previous season, in 2004 the Highlanders conceded 44 tries, 12 more than in 2003, but scored nine more tries then in 2003. Not only did they have a new head coach, but also 13 new players in their squad, and a new captain after Anton Oliver took over the reins from Tane Randell. This all contributed to them finishing the season ninth, after winning four, and losing six of their eleven matches.\nThe Highlander's 2005 season started with only their second ever loss to the Blues at Carisbrook, a 30–14 loss. Following this the side won six games consecutively, the first time the franchise had ever done so. They first defeated the Bulls 23–0, then the Sharks 43–7. They then won away against the Cats and Reds. They returned to Carisbrook and defeated the Brumbies 19–18, and the following week won in Wellington for the first time with a 26–16 win over the Hurricanes. After a draw with the Stormers and a bye, the Highlanders had gone unbeaten for eight weeks. Thus three weeks from the end of the round robin they were third, but after losing their remaining three matches fell to eighth for the season.\nExpansion: 2006–2014.\nAfter ten years the Super 12 was expanded to include two extra teams; the Western Force from Australia, and the Cheetahs from South Africa. The expanded competition was renamed the Super 14. The Highlanders continued under Cooper in 2006. Their first up match was a loss to the Crusaders in Christchurch, but they then won their next three games—including two in South Africa. They then lost two matches, to the Bulls and Sharks respectively, before defeating the Lions in Invercargill. They only won two of their last six games, and finished the season ranked ninth—the lowest ranked New Zealand team. The team lost several players to injury during the season, including James Ryan and Nick Evans.\nThe 2007 ended with a similar result to 2006. The Highlanders again finished ninth on the table, and worst of the New Zealand teams. They finished the season with five wins and eight losses from their thirteen matches. They started their season with a win over the Western Force, but then lost both their matches in South Africa to the Lions and Sharks. Of their next five matches they won three; against the Stormers, Reds and Cheetahs. They then won only one of their last five matches, against the Waratahs in Sydney. Following his fourth season in charge, and third with the Highlanders finishing ninth, coach Greg Cooper left the franchise to take up the assistant coaches position with the Blues. The coach for the 2008 season, Glenn Moore, was appointed 28 August 2007.\nThe Highlanders struggled in Moore's first season as coach. They won only three of their thirteen matches and finished eleventh on the table. Many of their losses were by seven points or less, including losses to the Reds, Brumbies, Waratahs and Hurricanes. The team did not win a match until the eighth round, when they defeated the Lions in Dunedin. Their second win of the season was over the Cheetahs Bloemfontein in round twelve. However, the team finished their season on a high — defeating the Crusaders in Christchurch. The Crusaders would go on to win the tournament that season. The 2009 season was similar to 2008, with the team winning four of their thirteen matches, and again losing many of their matches by seven points or less. After losing their first three matches, including to the Brumbies and Hurricanes by less than seven points, they defeated the Crusaders 6–0 in Dunedin for their first win of the season. The match produced the lowest aggregate score in Super Rugby history. After a narrow loss to the Chiefs, the Highlanders picked up their second win of the season over the Cheetahs. They then achieved their most dominant win of the season; a 36–12 victory over the Bulls. The Bull eventually won the tournament; the second year the Highlanders defeated the eventual champions. After a bye round, the Highlanders defeated the Reds for their third consecutive win. The team lost their remaining matches of the season — this included losses to the Stormers, Lions, and Western Force.\nAnother season with many more losses than wins occurred in 2010. The season started with a 32–17 loss to the Crusaders, followed by a narrow 15–19 loss to the Blues. The first season came next with a 31–24 win over the Cheetahs in South Africa. The South African trip ended with two losses though; a 33–0 defeat by the Stormers, and a high scoring loss to the Bulls. They eventually achieved their second win of the season over the Lions in round seven. Losses to the Chiefs and Western Force was followed by a narrow two-point loss to the Hurricanes. Next was their third win of the season; this time over the Waratahs in Invercargill. Their final two matches of the season were losses — 33–3 to the Brumbies, and a loss by two points to the Reds. Following the 2010 season, and after three seasons that resulted in only ten win in total, Moore was replaced by the Wellington provincial coach Jamie Joseph — a former Otago representative from the 1990s.\nThe appointment of Joseph as coach coincided with the expansion of the competition from 14 teams to 15 teams. The expanded competition was renamed \"Super Rugby\", and converted to a conference system with three conferences of five teams — Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The Highlanders now had to play each other New Zealand team twice, and four teams each from the Australian and South African conferences — 16 matches in total over the regular season. Joseph's rein as coach started with a win over the Hurricanes in Wellington, followed by a win over the Chiefs in Dunedin, and a win over the Bulls in Pretoria. The team then suffered their first loss of the season to the Stormers in Cape Town, followed by a loss to the Crusaders in Dunedin. The Highlanders then won their next four matches; their last a 26–18 victory over the Crusaders in Nelson. The Highlanders then lost all but one of their remaining matches of the season to finish with eight wins and eight losses in total. This left them eighth out of fifteen teams on the table, and third in the New Zealand conference.\nThe 2012 was one of two contrasting halves for the Highlanders. The team won their first four matches — against the Chiefs, Crusaders, Waratahs, and Hurricanes. By that point the Highlanders were on the top of the table, but lost the position after losing to the Brumbies in Canberra. After a win over the Rebels, loss to the Stormers, and a bye, the Highlanders defeated the Blues 30–27 in Dunedin. They narrowly defeated the Cheetahs in Bloemfontein in round 10; they then stood fifth in the table. The team went on to lose five of their seven remaining matches, and slip to ninth on the table after the end of the regular season. Despite winning more matches than in 2011, the Highlanders finished fourth in the New Zealand conference — with only the Blues below them.\nVictory 2015-present.\nHighlanders won the 2015 Super Rugby season, with Phil Gifford calling their win \"the greatest Super Rugby comeback this century.\" Thousands of fans participated in a Highlanders victory parade in Dunedin."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball All-Star Game venues",
        "text": "The first All-Star Game was held as part of the 1933 World's Fair at Comiskey Park and was the brainchild of Arch Ward, then sports editor for the \"Chicago Tribune\". Initially intended to be a one-time event, its great success resulted in making the game an annual event, with some years (1959–1962) having two All-Star Games.\nVenue selection.\nThe venue for each All-Star Game is chosen by an MLB selection committee. This choice may be made to commemorate a particular historical occasion, the opening of a new ballpark, or a significant milestone. The criteria for choosing the venue are subjective; for the most part, cities with new parks and cities who have not hosted the game in a long time or ever tend to be favored. The venues among the major league franchises: between 1964 and 2015, five teams hosted three times, 13 teams twice, ten teams once, and two teams not at all. The \"home team\" is the league in which the host franchise plays its games. Through the 2023 season, the American League has hosted 45 times, and the National League has hosted 48 times. Traditionally, the game alternates between the two leagues from year to year with ten exceptions:\nThis tradition was discontinued after the 2015 game.\nAs of 2023, one Major League Baseball franchise has never hosted an All-Star Game: the Tampa Bay Rays. The Miami Marlins hosted for the first time in 2017 following the 2012 opening of Marlins Park, although Miami was initially scheduled to host in 2000, MLB eventually moved the game to Atlanta. All-Star games have been played in D.C., hosted by both incarnations of the Washington Senators (now known as the Minnesota Twins and as the Texas Rangers), as well as by the Washington Nationals in 2018.\nOf the remaining 27 franchises, the New York Mets had gone the longest period without hosting since their sole hosting duty in 1964, but this streak came to an end at 49 years in 2013. During that span, 18 of the remaining 25 teams have hosted an All-Star Game at least twice since 1964: Atlanta Braves (1972, 2000) Chicago White Sox (1983 and 2003), Cincinnati Reds (1970, 1988, and 2015), Cleveland Indians (1981, 1997, 2019), Detroit Tigers (1971 and 2005), Houston Astros (1968, 1986, and 2004), Kansas City Royals (1973 and 2012), Los Angeles Angels (1967, 1989, and 2010), Milwaukee Brewers (1975 and 2002), Minnesota Twins (1965, 1985, and 2014), New York Yankees (1977 and 2008), Philadelphia Phillies (1976 and 1996), Pittsburgh Pirates (1974, 1994, and 2006), San Diego Padres (1978, 1992, and 2016), San Francisco Giants (1984 and 2007), Seattle Mariners (1979 and 2001), St. Louis Cardinals (1966 and 2009), and Washington Senators/Texas Rangers (1969 and 1995). The Oakland Athletics are now the team with the longest active hosting drought; they have not hosted since 1987.\nNew stadiums that have not hosted the All-Star Game in cities that have hosted it previously are: Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, the new Yankee Stadium in New York City, Truist Park in Atlanta, and Globe Life Field in Arlington. Truist Park was to host the 2021 game, but lost it in response to the passage of the Georgia Election Integrity Act of 2021.\nFuture All-Star Games will be played at Globe Life Field in 2024, Truist Park in 2025, and Citizens Bank Park in 2026, with Philadelphia selected well in advance as a part of the United States Semiquincentennial celebration.\nFollowing the game at the first Yankee Stadium in 2008 in its final season, the Bronx's old stadium joined Cleveland's old Cleveland Stadium (also known as Municipal Stadium prior to its own demolition) as the only venues that have hosted four Major League Baseball All-Star games. New York City has hosted it more than any other city, having done so nine times in five different stadiums; as of 2023, Tampa Bay remains the only major league metropolitan area since the first All-Star Game in 1933 to never have hosted.\nVarious statistics.\nBallparks that have hosted more than one All-Star Game.\nDiscontinued baseball parks.\nThe only discontinued ballparks that hosted one All-Star Game are: Ebbets Field in 1949, Memorial Stadium in 1958, Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in 1959, Shea Stadium in 1964, Metropolitan Stadium in 1965, Busch Memorial Stadium in 1966, Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium in 1972, the Kingdome in 1979, Olympic Stadium (Montreal) in 1982, Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in 1985, Globe Life Park in Arlington in 1995, and Turner Field in 2000.\nHosting All-Star Game and post-season games in same season.\nThe following teams have hosted the All-Star Game in the summer then proceeded to host post-season games in the fall:\n\"League Championship Series play began 1969\"\n\"Division Series play began 1995\"\nNotes.\nThe 2021 game was originally scheduled to be held at Truist Park in Atlanta, but it was moved in protest of a controversial voting bill by the Georgia State Legislature, which policy changes resulted in Georgia's highest voter turnout in history and placed Georgia as the highest voter turnout in the Southeast during the next election."

The four best teams then took part in a medal play off, and the teams placed 5–8 took part in a relegation play-off.

The 1976 IHWC tournament was first to feature major league professionals from the NHL and WHA, although in the end only the United States made use of the new rule, recalling eight pros from the Minnesota North Stars and Minnesota Fighting Saints. Some nations, such as the Soviet Union, had been using pros all along, while circumventing their status by listing them in the military. The Americans promptly made the medal play off for the first time since 1962 after beating Sweden and tying Finland in the first round.\nThe Czechoslovakia national ice hockey team won nine games and were unbeaten, becoming world champions for the fourth time.

The challenge races change somewhat each year. The Challenge series began in 2007 with 24 \"Win and You're In\" races from 2 countries. By 2014, the series had grown to 71 races across 13 countries. During that period, 24 winners of Breeders' Cup races had qualified via the challenge series.\nStarting in 2011, the Breeders' Cup also pays the entry fee and provides a travel allowance for the connections of the challenge race winners. NBC Sports has a longstanding agreement to both broadcast and live stream many of the \"Win and You're In\" challenge races, from June to October.\nCurrent challenge series.\nFor 2022, the Breeders' Cup committee restructured the series to ensure there are qualifying races in the east, midwest and west regions for most of the divisions, plus international qualifiers mainly for the turf races. Several races were added: the Grande Prêmio Brasil (Turf - International region), Beverly D. (Filly &amp; Mare Turf - Midwest), Green Flash (Turf Sprint - West region), Miss Grillo (Juvenile Fillies - East region), Ack Ack (Dirt Mile - Midwest region) and Pilgrim (Juvenile Turf - East). The Fleur de Lis, Suburban, John Nerud, Personal Ensign, Iroquois, Pocohantas, Jockey Club Derby, Santa Anita Sprint Championship, Zenyatta and First Lady were removed from the series. The King's Stand Stakes replaced the Diamond Jubilee Stakes as an international qualifier for the Turf Sprint.\nPast challenge series.\nThe 2007 series consisted of 24 races held at 6 different racetracks in the United States and Canada. Fourteen of the series winners later raced in the Breeders' Cup, with four of them winning: War Pass in the Juvenile, Ginger Punch in the Distaff, English Channel in the Turf and Curlin in the Classic.\n2012.\nFor 2012, the series consisted of 73 races in 10 countries, 52 of which were Grade / Group One events. Thirteen races were added to the series: the (South African) Queen's Plate, Gran Premio 25 de Mayo, Stephen Foster Handicap, Personal Ensign, Grosser Preis von Baden, Gallant Bloom, Pilgrim, Miss Grillo, Bourbon, Royal Lodge, Middle Park, Beresford, and the Prix de la Foret.\nForty-five horses entered in the 2012 Breeders' Cup races qualified via the challenge series, including seven of the winners.

Three more races from Japan were added in June: the February Stakes, the Yasuda Kinen and the Sprinter Stakes.\nForty-five entrants in the 2016 Breeders' Cup qualified via the Challenge series. Two Challenge series winners went on to win their respective division at the Breeders' Cup: Highland Reel and Classic Empire.\n2017.\nOn April 12, 2017, the Breeders Cup organization announced that the 2017 Breeders' Cup Challenge would consist of 81 races from 13 countries. Three races were added to the series: the Belmont Sprint Championship Stakes, the Highlander Stakes and the First Lady Stakes. The Gold Cup at Santa Anita, Belmont Oaks and Canadian Stakes were excluded from the series.\nFive winners of Challenge series races went on to win their respective division at the Breeders' Cup:\n2018.\nThe main change for the 2018 series was the addition of four \"win and you're in\" races from Royal Ascot: the Queen Anne Stakes providing a berth in the Mile division; the Prince of Wales's Stakes (G1) in the Turf; the Norfolk Stakes in the new Juvenile Turf Sprint; and the Diamond Jubilee Stakes in the Turf Sprint.

There were a total number of 33 participating athletes, with two qualifying heats and the final being held on 6 August 1997.\nThe question was, how to beat the Olympic Champion and new World Record holder Haile Gebrselassie. The pack, led by Kenyans Paul Koech and Dominic Kirui jogged around the track for almost 15 laps with a few constants; Gebrselassie was marking the leader from second or third place, and everybody else was jockeying for position to be near him. With ten laps to go, previous world record holder Salah Hissou made a more serious move to the front, the pace quickened by four seconds a lap and all the contenders reacted. Hissou only held the lead for a lap before dropping back but the faster trend continued and the pack dwindled to six. Even Kirui dropped off the back, but Koech continued to lead with his teammate Paul Tergat focused on Gebrselassie's back. The pace gradually slowed slightly, while Hissou and Domingos Castro took their turns behind Gebrselassie as the laps diminished. With two laps to go, Hissou and Castro boxed Gebrselassie and moved around him, that lasted for about 100 metres before Gebrselassie simply ran around them assuming a defensive position on Koech's outside shoulder. 550 metres before the finish, Gebrselassie took off, opening up a 10-metre gap before he reached the straightaway. For Gebrselassie, it was an easy last lap, almost a victory lap while still in competition. Tergat and behind him Hissou launched into their best last lap kicks, but it was far too little and too late to catch Gebrselassie. Tergat separated from Hissou for silver."

Jackson had a brief and unspectacular minor league career, never reaching the NHL, and is better known as a manager than as a player.\nJackson retired following the 1976–77 season, and was named head coach of the Great Falls Americans of the WHL prior to the 1979–80 season, his team going 2–25–1, until it folded on December 26, 1979. For the next two seasons, Jackson coached the Brandon Wheat Kings, and then served as their general manager for two seasons following that. Before the 1985–86 season Jackson joined the Minnesota North Stars as an assistant coach, and stayed with the franchise in one capacity or another until September 1, 1999, when he joined the Atlanta Thrashers as assistant general manager.\nOn July 6, 2000, Jackson rejoined the Dallas Stars, and was named interim co-general manager (along with Brett Hull) on November 13, 2007, and on May 22, 2008, the \"interim\" was removed from their title as both were signed to a 3-year deal to be co-general managers. On May 31, 2009, Jackson and Hull were replaced by Joe Nieuwendyk as general manager, and reassigned to other roles within the Dallas Stars organization.\nJackson's contract was not renewed by the Stars after its expiration on June 30, 2020, ending what was the longest tenure of any employee in the franchise's history at 33 years.

Currently, all participants must be U.S. citizens or have resided in the United States in the preceding 12 months. There is also a separate U.S. Open Badminton Championships which is open to foreign competitors. The history of the two tournaments is rather complicated. Prior to 1954 all U.S. Badminton Championships had a \"closed\" format with only U.S. citizens and residents eligible to compete. From 1954 through 1969 the tournament was open to foreign competition. Between 1970 and 1976 the format fluctuated. Both a closed and an open tournament were held from 1970 through 1972; an open tournament was held in 1973; a closed tournament was held in 1974 and 1975; and both a closed and an open tournament were held again in 1976. From 1977 through 1982 all U.S. national championships were closed. Since 1983 both a closed and an open tournament have generally been held at separate times in the season (the previous closed/open tourneys had been held contiguously).

He began his career at the NCAA level, playing for Merrimack Warriors men's ice hockey team. Wolfe spent four seasons in Massachusetts, but was used mainly as a backup goaltender, making 18 appearances in his time there.\nCareer.\nAfter completing his final college season in which he played 10 games and posted a .914 save percentage, Wolfe was signed by the Reading Royals for the remainder of the 2001–02 term, where he allowed seven goals on 87 shots in three ECHL games. He signed with the Adirondack IceHawks at the lower UHL level, where for the first time in his career he managed to claim the first team spot. Wolfe also featured in the post-season for the IceHawks.\nWolfe's displays for the IceHawks demonstrated to the Roanoke Express that he deserved a chance to start at ECHL level, and they signed him for the start of the 2003–04 season. It was a chance which Wolfe seized, making 37 regular and two post-season appearances. Despite his positive showing, Wolfe was to split the following season between the Mississippi Sea Wolves, Bakersfield Condors and Texas Wildcatters. After playing with the Augusta Lynx for the 2005–06 season, the Manchester Phoenix, a team in Britain's EIHL, signed Wolfe in the summer of 2006 to play as their starting goaltender.\nWolfe again played well in the #1 role, appearing in a career high 53 games, and was one of the Phoenix' most reliable players in a season which saw the team play for most of the term without a home rink. Wolfe opted not to re-sign the following year, in part because of the birth of his first child. Coach Tony Hand opted to sign ex-NHL goaltender Scott Fankhouser as a result. Wolfe took the opportunity to move back to North America where he played the 2007–2008 season for the Oklahoma City Blazers of the CHL and posted a .910 save percentage while appearing in 35 games.\nWolfe remained in the CHL for the 2008–09 term, signing for the New Mexico Scorpions."

        "text": "The 2005 Masters (officially the 2005 Rileys Club Masters) was the 2005 edition of the non-ranking Masters professional snooker tournament. It was held from 13 to 20 February 2005 at the Wembley Conference Centre, London. The tournament was the 31st staging of the competition and was the sixth of nine World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) main tour events in the 2004/2005 season. The tournament was broadcast in the United Kingdom on the BBC and by Eurosport in Europe.\nRonnie O'Sullivan, the 2004 world champion, won the tournament, defeating 1999 Masters winner John Higgins ten &lt;dfn&gt;frames&lt;/dfn&gt; to three in the final to claim his first Masters tournament victory since 1995. It was O'Sullivan's second Masters title in his fifth appearance in the final. O'Sullivan became the sixth player in Masters history to win the tournament more than once. In the semi-finals Higgins beat Peter Ebdon 6–3 and O'Sullivan defeated Jimmy White 6–1. Ding Junhui made the tournament's highest break of 141 in his first round match against Ken Doherty. The Masters preceded the Irish Masters and followed the Malta Cup.\nTournament summary.\nThe Masters was first held in 1975 and is part of the Triple Crown events of the game of snooker alongside the World Snooker Championship and the UK Championship; it does not have official ranking status. The 2005 tournament, held between 13 and 20 February at the Wembley Conference Centre in London, was the sixth of nine World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) main tour events of the 2004/2005 season, following the Malta Cup and preceding the Irish Masters. The defending Masters champion was Paul Hunter, who defeated Ronnie O'Sullivan 10–9 in the 2004 final.\nSponsored by the national sports member company Rileys Club for the first time, it had a total prize fund of £277,500, and the host broadcasters were the BBC and Eurosport. All matches were the best-of-11 frames until the final, which was played to the best-of-19 frames. While Hunter had a poor form since making the semi-finals of the Grand Prix tournament, he said he was unworried, \"I have been preparing for events in the same way and I'm not going to change my game. It's just one of those things at the moment and once I get a run of wins under my belt I'll be fine.\"\nFormat and wild-card round.\nDefending champion Hunter was the first seed with world champion O'Sullivan seeded second. Places were allocated to the top 16 players in the world rankings. Players seeded 15 and 16 played in the wild-card round against the two wild-card selections, Stephen Maguire (ranked 24) and Ding Junhui (ranked 76). Maguire had won the UK Championship the previous November and was making his Masters debut. Ding played seed 16 Marco Fu and won 6–4. Trailing 4–2 after Fu took the opening four frames with breaks of 100 and 57, Ding responded to win the next four frames with breaks of 50 and 77 in the seventh and eighth frames to win. Graeme Dott was 2–1 behind fellow Scot Maguire when he clinched five of the next seven frames with breaks of 98, 92, 83, 62 and 54 to win 6–4. It was Dott's first victory at the Wembley Conference Centre in his fourth Masters appearance.\nRound 1.\nIn his first round match world number 13 and three-time Masters champion Steve Davis overhauled Hunter 6–5. Breaks of 70 and 82 put Davis into a 2–0 lead. The match went to a final frame decider that Davis led with a score of 58–0. He missed a routine red ball shot, and Hunter countered with a 46 break, only for him to miss a shot. A brief safety shot exchange ensued before Davis undercut the final red ball down the side cushion and into the top right-hand corner pocket. Davis then potted the coloured balls to win. Peter Ebdon took 1 hour and 45 minutes to whitewash his opponent David Gray 6–0 with breaks of 106, 96, 110, 69 and 96; Gray did not pot a single ball in the final three frames. After the match, Ebdon attributed the result to losing weight through physical activity. The 2004 Players' Championship winner Jimmy White edged out Matthew Stevens 6–5. Trailing 5–3 White needed two snookers and a clearance to get back into contention. He achieved this when Stevens narrowly missed a long-range red ball shot. White then compiled a break of 115 to force a final frame decider in which he outscored Stevens 88–0 to progress into the quarter-finals.\nO'Sullivan began his match against Dott with a break of 64 and then made his 21st century break of the 2004/2005 season with a 130 in the second. Dott tied the match at 3–3 with a 41 clearance. O'Sullivan then clinched the next three frames with breaks of 72 and 85 with a 51 clearance to win 6–3. John Higgins, the 1999 Masters champion. faced fellow Scot Chris Small. Higgins won the opening four frames with 106, 60, 47 and 48 runs. Small prevented a whitewash by taking frame five. Higgins lost the chance of a maximum break in frame six when he missed the sixth black ball shot while on 65 points. He then won frame seven and the game 6–1. At age 17 Ding became the youngest quarter-finals player in Masters history when he defeated Ken Doherty, the 1997 world champion, 6–1; Doherty contracted an ear infection three days earlier . Doherty won frame two as Ding took the first, third and fourth frames with the tournament's highest break (a 141 clearance) and further runs of 81 and 52. Doherty lost frame five after missing the black ball and then the sixth with a missed shot on the pink. He then forced a re-spotted black ball finish in frame seven that Ding won.\nTwo time Masters and world champion Mark Williams played the 1994 tournament winner and world number 10 Alan McManus. McManus made breaks of 63 and 54 to lead 2–1. Williams compiled breaks of 67, 54, 116 and a 66 clearance to defeat McManus 6–3 after the latter missed a straightforward red ball shot in the eighth frame. In the final first-round game Stephen Hendry played world number 12 Stephen Lee. Hendry led the match throughout from breaks of 61, 78, 110 and 82. He amassed an unchallenged 325 points to win 6–1 and claim his 40th match victory at the Masters. Hendry missed the chance to achieve a seventh career maximum break when attempting a 13th black ball shot in frame five; he was out of position from a four-cushion positional shot and was required to pot the blue ball. Lee stated afterwards that he was considered ending his snooker career had he not improved his confidence and playing ability.\nQuarter-finals.\nIn the opening quarter-final match, Ebdon defeated Davis 6–1. After some advanced tactical play on the table Ebdon opened out an early lead of 3–0 with breaks of 60, 62 and 78. Although Davis took a solitary frame, Ebdon continued to break-build with runs of 88, 68 and 66 to win the match. The victory enabled Ebdon to reach the semi-finals of the Masters for the first time in his career since the 1995 tournament. The second quarter-final match had Higgins play fellow Scot Hendry. Higgins built a 5–1 lead from breaks of 101, 62 and 59; Hendry lacked composure during this period. Hendry did compile a 108 century break in frame seven before Higgins won frame eight to claim a 6–2 victory. Hendry bemoaned his loss of form, \"I don't know where that came from. You are going to have days when you don't play well. You would be a robot if you didn't but my head wasn't right and I played dreadfully.\" Higgins shared his opponent's view, \"I'm just happy in my own mind to be playing better because if you are not happy within yourself you won't win, no matter who you are playing.\"\nWhite overcame Williams to win 6–5. White had a 3–0 advantage, producing a break of 73, a 51 clearance and a 30 break in the third frame. Williams spoke to referee Paul Collier to suggest that the table's top cushion had too much bounce and White concurred. Both players agreed to have an early mid-session interval as table fitters took 25 minutes to correct the table's mechanics. Williams clinched the next three frames with a trio of half-centuries to tie the match at 3–3. White and Williams shared the following four frames to force a final frame decider that White won. The WPBSA issued a statement that examination of the table confirmed that there was no change in playing conditions and stated it would investigate whether static in the arena affected it. O'Sullivan took 104 minutes to defeat Ding 6–2 and outscored him 444–43 in the final five frames. Trailing 2–1 O'Sullivan won the following five frames with breaks of 77, 92, 123 and 67, saying afterwards, \"With two players capable of scoring heavily there is always a danger of one of them running away with the game.\"\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were held on 19 February. The first semi-final was between Ebdon and Higgins. The match began with Higgins compiling breaks of 67 and 69 to lead 2–0. It appeared he would increase his lead by one frame in the third, before he missed a black ball and Ebdon produced a clearance to win the frame. Higgins took frame four and Ebdon achieved a 96 break to win the fifth. Ebdon lost a 40-minute sixth frame to Higgins, who then secured frame seven after fluking a red ball midway through. A run of 79 from Ebdon pressured Higgins; the latter clinched frame nine to win the match 6–3. After the game Higgins admitted he thought of his 6–5 loss to Dott in the semi-finals of the Malta Cup in January because he missed some important shots that provided Ebdon with opportunities, \"What happened in Malta came back into my mind and put me under pressure. You rarely see great semi-finals because there's so much riding on the match. I needed a few chances but I'm delighted to get through to the final and pleased to be back playing to a decent standard.\"\nIn the other semi-final, White, who competed in a record-breaking 11th Masters semi-final, was defeated by O'Sullivan 6–1. O'Sullivan produced two consecutive breaks of 76 and 97 in the first three frames to lead 3–0 as White did not strike a single ball for 35 minutes. In frame four, White prevented O'Sullivan from whitewashing him with a run of 75. O'Sullivan subsequently made breaks of 49, 36, 106, 41 and 36 in the next three frames to eliminate White from the tournament in 97 minutes. O'Sullivan said after the match a free-flowing game was to be expected with White, \"It was a bit like a derby match in football where there was one player doing well coming into the match and one not doing so well but where anything could happen amongst the excitement with all the adrenaline flowing.\" White admitted he had been unable to challenge his opponent, \"I had a couple of chances and didn't do anything with them. You can't do that against Ronnie. But it's been a great week and I've really enjoyed myself.\"\nFinal.\nThe match was both O'Sullivan's and Higgins' third appearance in a final at the Masters. In the best-of-19 frame final, held before 2,500 people, O'Sullivan defeated Higgins 10–3 to win second Masters title and his first since the 1995 tournament. He joined Cliff Thorburn, Alex Higgins, Hendry, Davis and Hunter as the sixth player to win the Masters more than once. It was his third title of the 2004/2005 season after winning Grand Prix in October and the Welsh Open in January. The victory earned O'Sullivan £125,000 and brought his season's cumulative total to £240,750. The media stated the match was the most dominant performance in a Masters final since the 1988 tournament match in which Davis whitewashed Mike Hallett 9–0. John Dee of \"The Daily Telegraph\" wrote of the match, \"Never before has snooker reached the high standard which O'Sullivan displayed on the Wembley stage\", and the reporter for the \"Irish Examiner\" called O'Sullivan's win \"breathtaking\".\nIn the afternoon session, O'Sullivan took the first frame with a break of 95, after jousting with Higgins in a safety shot battle for a quarter of an hour. Higgins followed with breaks of 54 and 76 in the second and third frames to go 2–1 ahead. Entering the mid-session interval, O'Sullivan equalled the score at 2–2 with a 107 break. He took the lead with a half-century run in the fifth frame. Higgins potted two balls as O'Sullivan produced runs of 58 and 97 in frames six and seven. Trailing 32–0 in the eighth frame, O'Sullivan missed a pink ball shot to a centre pocket, allowing Higgins to produce a 53 run, and leave O'Sullivan requiring two snookers after a four-point foul. Although O'Sullivan obtained the necessary points, Higgins won the frame on the blue ball to leave it 5–3 at the conclusion of the first session. In the evening session, O'Sullivan took 62 minutes to produce breaks of 79, 75 and 134 to win the match and the tournament. O'Sullivan had a 97 per cent of potting rate success to Higgins' 89 per cent at the end of the final and brought his total season century breaks to 25. 1991 world champion and BBC analyst John Parrott likened the statistic to O'Sullivan's 17–4 victory over Hendry in the semi-finals of the 2004 World Snooker Championship, \"It is a pleasure to watch. He played every shot in the book and each time the cue ball landed on a sixpence.\"\nAfter his victory O'Sullivan said he was playing better than before, \"I played good frames from start to finish. And to do it against a player of John's calibre makes it more satisfying. There's no better place than Wembley or Sheffield to produce your best and so this win is very satisfying.\" Higgins labelled O'Sullivan \"a total genius\" due to his high level of playing standard, \"Somehow the rest of us have got to try and catch up. It was great to watch even though I was on the receiving end. I know some other top players can produce stuff like that but Ronnie was inch perfect every time.\"\nWild-card round.\nThe wild-card round was played with two seeded players and two wild card entrants.

Jones has served on coaching staffs at numerous colleges and National Football League (NFL) teams.\nEarly life and coaching career.\nA native of Sunray, Texas, Jones graduated from Sunray High School in 1974. He went on to receive a bachelor's degree from Northwestern Oklahoma State University and a master's degree from Northeastern State University. While at Northeastern, he began his coaching career. In 1984, he joined John Cooper's staff at the University of Tulsa as strength and conditioning coach and moved with him to Arizona State University a year later.\nIn 1987, he joined Buddy Ryan's coaching staff with the Philadelphia Eagles. After two stints with the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Raiders in 1991 and 1992, respectively, Jones rejoined Ryan as linebackers coach for the Houston Oilers in 1993. As Ryan became head coach for the Arizona Cardinals, he selected Jones as his defensive coordinator. In 1995, Arizona ranked last in total defense in the NFL, giving up 26.4 points and 356.5 total yards per game. Ryan and his complete staff were fired subsequently.\nHeading back to the collegiate ranks, Jones became defensive coordinator at the University of Texas at El Paso under coach Charlie Bailey. In 2000, Bailey was replaced by Gary Nord, so Jones went on to coach the special teams for the Buffalo Bills. Bills owner Ralph Wilson was unimpressed with Jones's work with the team and demanded Jones's firing after one season; when head coach Wade Phillips refused, Wilson fired them both.\nJones became head coach at Ottawa University, a small NAIA school in Ottawa, Kansas. Jones was the 27th head coach for the Braves and he held that position for the 2001 season.\nThe Ottawa Braves, coming off a 9–0 season in 2000, finished 6–4 under Jones, who then left for West Texas A&amp;M University.\nDespite making the bold statement that West Texas A&amp;M would win an NCAA Division II national football championship under his guidance, Jones amassed only a 5–27 record as Buffaloes head coach. Jones was suspended with pay on April 13, 2005, amid allegations that he had misused university resources for personal gain. Jones resigned as the Buffaloes' head coach five days later on April 18 after a university investigation discovered that Jones had been running a marketing business out of his office. The investigation also stated that Jones abused his authority by exerting undue influence on student athletes and employees by soliciting membership in his marketing business. University police seized Jones' computer and found inappropriate material on it."

Czechoslovakia won for the fifth time, and second in a row, claiming their 14th and final European title as well.\nCanada returned after an eight-year absence with a team comprised completely of NHL players from teams that had missed the Stanley Cup playoffs. While being competitive in most games, many people were reportedly upset by the Canadians' conduct on the ice and after the games. The team refused to listen to the opposing teams' national anthems when they lost, and the coach, Johnny Wilson, explained their multiple misconduct penalties by saying, \"We just couldn't compete with the Soviets, and ... it is natural to try to get revenge.\"\nThe tournament itself was very close for the medals, with a spectacular last day. Canada, with a chance still to get a bronze, set a record by defeating the eventual champions eight to two. Never before had a first place team lost a game that badly.

        "title": "Bob Ward (American football, born 1927)",
        "text": "Robert Richard Ward (September 16, 1927 – April 29, 2005) was an American gridiron football coach and player. He played college football for the Terrapins at the University of Maryland. He is considered, alongside Randy White, as one of the greatest linemen to have ever played for Maryland. Ward is the only player to have been named an Associated Press first-team All-American for both an offensive and defensive position.\nIn 1950, Ward was named a first-team All-American, and the following year, he received consensus first-team honors. He served as the Maryland head football coach from 1967 to 1968, but without success. He coached football for a total of 22 years, including assistant coaching positions at Oklahoma, Iowa State, and Army, and in the Canadian Football League. Ward was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1980.\nEarly life.\nBob Ward was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey on September 16, 1927. He attended Thomas Jefferson High School. During the Second World War, Ward enlisted in the United States Army. He completed Airborne School to become a paratrooper and was stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia. He later served as a first lieutenant in the United States Air Force.\nCollege career.\nIn 1948, Ward enrolled at the University of Maryland and played varsity football all four years as both an offensive guard and defensive lineman. At and , Ward was undersized for a lineman by the standards of the day (and would be significantly undersized compared with current linemen), but was known for \"consistently dominat[ing]\" much larger players. His relatively small stature earned him the nickname of the \"watch-charm guard.\" Ward was known for his aggressiveness and tenacity, traits he used to compensate for being out-sized by opposing linemen. Maryland quarterback and 1952 Heisman Trophy runner-up, Jack Scarbath, later said about Ward:\n\"I remember a game against Michigan State when Bobby [Ward] was at middle guard and went right over top of the center to make a tackle. Then he went right under the center to make another tackle. A little later, he went around the center to the left. Then he went around him to the right. I've never seen anybody who could dominate a game like Bobby.\"\nDuring Ward's four years at Maryland, the Terrapins achieved a 32–7–1 record, won two bowl games, and secured a national championship. In the 1950 Gator Bowl, Ward was named the game's Most Valuable Player. In the 1952 Sugar Bowl, what \"The Washington Post\" called the second \"game of the century\", Ward was part of the third-ranked Maryland team that defeated coach Robert Neyland's first-ranked Tennessee team, 28–13. That performance capped a perfect 10–0 season for the Terrapins. During that final game of his career, Ward tackled Tennessee offensive back Hank Lauricella and forced a fumble, upon which Maryland capitalized with a touchdown. Ward graduated from the University of Maryland in 1951 with a bachelor's degree in business.\nIn the 1952 College All-Star Game, Ward captained the college team against the reigning National Football League (NFL) champions, the Los Angeles Rams, but the professionals won, 10–7. Ward declined a professional playing career himself, and turned down contract offers from the Baltimore Colts and a 24th-round NFL Draft selection by the Dallas Texans.\nAwards and praise.\nWard was named an Associated Press (AP) first-team All-American as a defensive middle guard in 1950 and as an offensive guard in 1951. He is the only player to have ever achieved the honor for both an offensive and defensive position. In 1950, legendary sportswriter Grantland Rice named Ward a \"Look\" magazine All-American, and every team that Maryland had played selected Ward to the \"Chicago Tribune\" All-Players All-America team. He was also named to the 1950 All-Southern Conference team.\nIn 1951, Ward was a consensus All-American as selected by the Associated Press, United Press International, \"The Sporting News\", and the International News Service. He was also named the 1951 Southern Conference Player of the Year, the Washington D.C. Touchdown Club Lineman of the Year, and the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association Lineman of the Year. He was again selected to the All-Southern Conference team in 1951. Ward was voted as Maryland's Most Valuable Player all four years of his playing career and twice received the Anthony C. Nardo Memorial Trophy for the team's most outstanding lineman. His jersey number, 28, was the first to be retired by the University of Maryland.\nMaryland head coach Jim Tatum, who had previously coached eight first-team All-Americans at Oklahoma and coached six aside from Ward at Maryland, said that Ward was \"the greatest football player I've seen ounce-for-ounce, and the best I've ever coached.\" Quarterback Jack Scarbath considered Ward one of Maryland's best all-time linemen alongside Randy White. Teammate and first-round NFL Draft pick Ed Modzelewski said, \"I still believe he was the greatest player, pound for pound, that I have seen in either pro or college ball.\" Ward was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1980, and into the University of Maryland Athletic Hall of Fame in 1984.\nCoaching career.\nAfter he declined offers to pursue a professional playing career, Ward coached the game for 22 years. Most of that time was spent as an assistant coach, and he served in that capacity at Maryland from 1952 to 1957, Oklahoma from 1957 to 1958, Iowa State from 1958 to 1965, and Army in 1966. At the United States Military Academy, Ward enjoyed the strictly regimented environment, and the players appreciated his aggressiveness.\nIn 1967, Ward returned to his alma mater to take the head coaching position. Before the season, 12 players failed to academically qualify to play on the team. During that first season, the team lost all nine of their games for the first time in the modern era. Ward's second year saw slight improvement, recording eight losses but with wins over North Carolina and South Carolina. However, many of his players were growing increasingly disgruntled with his coaching style.\nIn March 1969, Maryland athletic director Jim Kehoe called a meeting among 120 players, Ward, his assistants, and a three-man committee. Thirty-one players told Ward that they no longer wished to play on the team and accused him of using intimidation tactics that included verbal and physical abuse. Ward listened to the player's grievances, but did not respond at the time. Two days later, he resigned as head coach. Later that year, \"Sports Illustrated\" interviewed Ward, and he said:\"I won't go into all the specifics, but it wasn't the good players who started it. It was the guys who couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag, guys who sat on the bench and couldn't take it and a couple of pip-squeak cub newspaper guys who don't know what football's all about ... He gets on the campus newspaper and all of a sudden he's got power he never thought of having.\"\n\"The Diamondback\", the university's student newspaper, had criticized Ward for moving the team into one dormitory, which forced some other students out. Ward stated that the move was done on the advice of Kehoe—which Kehoe denied—and with the intent of focusing the players on their studies and building camaraderie. Ward and his assistants monitored the players' academic performance, enforced class attendance, and placed curfews on perceived troublemakers. Ward stated that, in his first year, only two of his players failed out of the school that he claimed had a history of poor athlete academics. He complained that he was a scapegoat and that there had been poor communication between him and Kehoe. Penn State head coach Joe Paterno was concerned with the situation surrounding Ward's resignation and sent a letter to the American Football Coaches Association demanding an investigation. Paterno said:\"I don't know who's right or wrong, but ... I don't think it's a good thing for a squad to fire a coach. As an association, we ought to know what happened. If a university fired an English professor because his class didn't like the way he was doing things, I know darn well that the American Association of University Professors would want to know what happened.\"\nMaryland head coach Ralph Friedgen played as an offensive guard under Ward, and was one of the players who remained on the team when 40 of his teammates walked off in protest. Long after the events, Friedgen said \"he was a tough coach ... If he had addressed some of the players' concerns, I don't know that so many would have left ... One of the things I learned from him was to surround myself with good assistants, and I don't know if he necessarily did that.\" Kehoe, who had been one of Ward's track coaches in college, said, \"I think Bob's problem was that he expected his players to play and hustle the same way he had, and times had changed.\" After Maryland, Ward took a job as an assistant coach with the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League in 1969, and later coached for the Montreal Alouettes, from 1970 to 1971, and the Toronto Argonauts from 1975 to 1976. He remained in Canada for the remainder of his coaching career.\nLater life.\nAfter his Canadian coaching stint, Ward and his wife, Miss Ellen, opened a liquor store, Manhattan Liquors, located on the City Dock in Annapolis, Maryland, which they operated from 1970 to 1988. They had three sons, James; Robert, Jr.; and Kelly; and one daughter, Kathleen. Kelly Ward attended Iowa State University where he was a three-time All-American wrestler and the national champion in his weight class in 1979. Bob Ward died in one of his sons' homes in Laytonsville, Maryland on April 29, 2005, at the age of 77, due to complications related to Alzheimer's disease. His remains were interred at the Arlington National Cemetery."
